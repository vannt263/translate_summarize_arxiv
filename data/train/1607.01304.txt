    "subdwarfs are galactic fossils that presumably comprise the bulk of the halo , and are crucial touchstones of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of the milky way .",
    "the local paucity of subdwarfs and their intrinsic faintness make them difficult to characterize , unlike their disk counterparts . for example , there are currently only three confirmed subdwarf systems within 10 parsecs : @xmath0 cas ab , cf uma , and kapteyn s star @xcite .",
    "many subdwarfs are detected via high proper motion star surveys ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , yielding important information about their kinematics , chemical compositions , and space densities .",
    "however , their masses  the single most important parameter for a star  are still mostly unknown , but would be of great use in studies of the galactic halo , globular clusters , and other old and/or low metallicity systems .",
    "there are currently only a half dozen subdwarf systems ( here defined as stars having [ m / h ] or [ fe / h]@xmath1@xmath20.5 ) with dynamical mass measurements .",
    "@xcite used infrared speckle interferometry and @xcite used adaptive optics to measure the masses of @xmath0 cas ab , which has [ fe / h]@xmath30.71 @xcite and is one of the nearest subdwarf systems .",
    "@xcite reported masses for gj 704 ab ( 99 her ) , which has [ fe / h]@xmath30.58 ( see table  [ tbl : gj704mh ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported total masses for two subdwarf binaries ( hip 85209ab and hip 95575ab ) using the differential speckle survey instrument ( dssi ) to resolve these two doubled - lined spectroscopic binaries @xcite .",
    "we use the mass - ratio from sb2 results and total masses from @xcite to get individual masses .",
    "all of these results are summarized in table  [ tbl : mass ] .",
    "we note that hip 81023ab and hip 103987ab both have metallicity less than @xmath20.5 , but have preliminary orbital results from @xcite .",
    "we did not include them in our analysis .",
    "@xcite combined both single - lined spectroscopic data , photocentric orbital data from the hipparcos intermediate astrometric data and an empirical mass - luminosity relation to estimate masses for four additional subdwarf systems with [ fe / h]@xmath1@xmath20.5 ( hip 705 , hip 39893 , hip 55022 , hip 59750 and hip 73440 ) . however , these masses are not measured dynamically , as they rely on an empirical mass - luminosity relation from stars with solar metallicity , so these stars are not included in our discussion . finally , @xcite reported the total system mass and mass ratio of gj 60ab with [ fe / h]@xmath30.65 @xcite .",
    "a few years later , @xcite reported that the system could harbor four components rather than two , with close binaries a - c and b - d , where b - d is an eclipsing binary with a period of 0.45 days . because of the complexity of this system",
    ", we conclude that no reliable masses for individual components have been measured , so do not include this system in the discussion .",
    "nearby galactic globular clusers ( gcs ) are also homes of low metallicities stars .",
    "recently , the clusters ages experiment ( case ) project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) has detected and measured many detached eclipsing binaries in @xmath4 cen , 47 tuc , m4 , m55 and ngc6362 .",
    "these binaries are comprised of either massive or evolved stars , and their metallicities are much lower than nearby field subdwarfs , so they are not discussed further in this paper either .    because the local known subdwarf density is far less than that for dwarfs , coupled with the fact that the multiplicity of cool subdwarfs appears to be lower than that of main sequence stars @xcite , it has been difficult to identify appropriate binary systems to target for dynamical mass determinations .",
    "this is particularly true for low mass m - type subdwarfs with masses less than 0.6 @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the number of dynamical masses measured for low metallicity subdwarfs is much less than for their counterparts , the main sequence dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "building an empirical mass - luminosity relation for low metallicity stars has proven difficult , and rigorous testing of low metallicity theoretical models remains to be done . in this manuscript , we present new dynamical masses of @xmath60.47 and 0.44 @xmath5 for the low metallicity subdwarfs , g 006 - 026 b and c , adding two subdwarf masses to establish the empirical mass - luminosity relation . we also recalculate the masses for gj 704 a and b by reassessing the resolved measurements to date .",
    "g 006 - 026 bc ia a double - lined spectroscopic binary with period of about 302 days @xcite .",

    "later , @xcite and @xcite use photometry to determine the primary s @xmath8=-0.52 $ ] and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the b and c components have the same metallicity as the primary , and that they therefore meet our criterion for subdwarfs as stars having [ fe / h]@xmath1@xmath20.5 .",

    "the binary s orbital inclination ( @xmath14 ) and longitude of the ascending of node ( @xmath15 ) remain unknown from spectroscopic data alone .",
    "because of its relatively large @xmath16 value among the 34 sb2 systems in @xcite , we expected the fine guidance sensor on the hubble space telescope to be able to resolve the system at appropriate orbital phases . by accurately measuring the angular separation of the two components at only a few epochs",

    "we utilized one of _",
    "hubble space telescope s _ three fine guidance sensors ( hst / fgs1r , hereafter simply fgs ) in its trans mode to resolve g 006 - 026 bc .",
    "the fgs is a white light shearing interferometer .",
    "when operated in it high angular resolution trans mode , it scans a luminous source and produces interference fringes along two orthogonal axis ( x and y ) .",
    "resolved binary systems yield interference fringes , or s - curves , that have reduced amplitude and different morphology than those of point sources ( unresolved stars ) .",
    "model binary systems , built from point source templates , are used to determine the projected separation and relative bightness of the binary components along both the fgs x and y axis .",
    "we carried out trans mode observations of g 006 - 026 bc during _ hst _ cycles 15 and 19 to measure the separations and position angles for the c component relative to b at six epochs .",
    "typically , we scheduled 3032 scans on both x and y axes during each visit , with scan lengths of 0410 on either side of the target .",
    "observations were made through the f583w filter , which provides magnitude differences similar to the @xmath21 band in the johnson system ( hereafter , simply @xmath22 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic data @xcite , available mass estimates , and the hipparcos distance to g 006 - 026 a indicated that the maximum separation of the two stars would be @xmath1725 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "however , because we did not know the position angle of the binary ( due to lack of knowledge of orbit s inclination and longitude of ascending node ) , it was not possible to select with certainty an orientation of the _ hst _ that would guarrentee that the binary would be resolved along both axes of the fgs , which has a per axis angular resolution close to 10 mas .",
    "for the first observation in 2006 , we selected an observation date that corresponded to a time of maximum separation assuming an inclination of 45 degrees , but still with no knowledge of the longitude of ascending node .",
    "the binary was well resolved along the fgs x - axis but unresolved along the y - axis .",
    "the observed separation along the x axis allowed for an estimate of the system s inclination but left a position angle uncertainty of about + /-",
    "27 degrees ( because the actual y - axis separation can be anywhere from + /-10 mas ) .",
    "subsequent observations in 2011 through 2014 were planned using the spectroscopic orbital elements combined with the fgs data previously acquired . for our last epoch in 2014 , we observed the binary in two consecutive _ hst _ orbits with a telescope roll change of 41 degrees between them in an attempted to resolve the system along both fgs axes , or to at least tightly constrain the binary position angle .",
    "the standard _",
    "strfits _ routine in the iraf / stsdas package was used to convert the archived trans mode fits files into geis files ( generic edited information sets , the original file structure used for the legacy _ hst _ instrument calibration pipelines , but still in use for fgs ) . for each visit",
    "these geis data were processed through the fgs raw data processing routine _ calfgsa _ , resulting in sets of individual interference scans in the x and y directions across the binary . the analysis package _",
    "ptrans _ was then used to cross - correlate , and co - add the individual scans , and to smooth the final co - added x and y axis scans for each visit .",
    "additional details of the reduction procedure can be found in the _ hst / fgs data handbook _ ( http://www.stsci.edu/hst/fgs/documents/datahandbook/ ) .",
    "the analysis of fgs trans mode observations of binary stars requires the availabilty of trans mode observations of single ( point source ) calibration stars of similar color . in january 2009",
    "the fgs1r internal optics were re - aligned to re - optimize ( change ) the instrument s interferometric response .",
    "thus our early 2006 epoch observation uses sao 185689 as the calibration star , which was observed in 2006 , while all later epochs use lhs 73 , which was observed in 2009 after the fgs re - optimization .",
    "the same data processing routines and packages discussed above were applied to these calibaration stars .",
    "routine monitoring of fgs trans mode performance by stsci indicates that its interference fringes have not changed since fgs s realignment in 2009 , so use of lhs 73 data from 2009 as the point source template for the later epochs is justified .",
    "we note that lhs 73 ( @xmath233.44 ) is a known low metallicity k6 subdwarf @xcite with a similar color to g 006 - 026 bc ( @xmath234.14 ) .",
    "two other often used fgs calibrators , latcol - a and hd233877 , do not yield better fits / residuals than lhs 73 , so we use lhs 73 as our calibrator .    finally , we used the standard _ binary_fit _",
    "package discussed in the _ hst fgs data handbook _ to compare the interference fringes , or s - curves , of g 006 - 026 bc to the calibrators to calculate the best fitting component magnitude difference and separations in the x and y directions .",

    ", we fix the @xmath24 m at 0.3 with an error of 0.3 mag and apply this fixed value for all other scans while we use _",

    "we converted these separations along the fgs axes to separations @xmath25 and position angles @xmath26 on the sky using the _ hst _ keyword pa@xmath27aper in the geis header , which is the position angle of the fgs y - axis at the time of the observation .",
    "results for the six epochs of observation are given in table  [ tbl : seppa ] .",
    "measurement errors in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are shown in parenthess .",
    "for epochs 2006.55227 and 2011.83228 the binary was only resolved along one of fgs axis , therefore the resultant uncertainty in position angle is large ( assuming up to 10 mas uncertainty in separation along the unresolved axis ) .",
    "the data acquired in 2014 has the binary marginally resolved along the fgs y - axis . for such small separations , solutions of the opposite parity must be considered ( i.e. , a separation of -12.4 mas is nearly indistinguishable from a separation of + 12.4 mas ) . however , a different parity of the y - axis separation for either of the two visits produces incompatible position angles ( 205.26 degrees for the first visit , 299.63 degress for the second visit ) .",

    "however , until we can link the origins of these field subdwarfs to nearby gcs , we conservatively adopt 6 gyr as the age for the all nearby subdwarfs .",
    "we sketch 6 gyr isochrones for stars with [ m / h ] = @xmath20.5 , @xmath21.0 , and @xmath22.0 from bt - settl isochrones @xcite in figure  [ fig : mlr ] to permit comparisons to the empirical points for the subwarfs . according to the models ,",
    "low metallicity subdwarfs appear brighter in @xmath55 than dwarfs at a given mass , or alternately , are less massive for a given @xmath55 .    systems like @xmath0 cas ab and gj 704 ab are clearly seen above the mass - luminosity relation of main sequence stars .",
    "the locations of @xmath0 cas a and b , which have [ m / h ] = @xmath20.71 , are well - matched to the model predictions for stars with [ m / h ] = @xmath21.0 at an age of 6 gyr .",
    "the metallicity of gj 704 ab appears much lower ( [ m / h]@xmath561.0 ) than what has been measured [ fe / h]=@xmath20.58 , but the two subdwarfs certainly appear to be of lower metallicity than main sequence stars .",
    "we note that @xcite used _",
    "herschel s _ photodetector and array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ) at 100 and 160 @xmath0 m to reveal a rare and convincing circumbinary polar - ring debris disk around gj 704 ab .",
    "this makes this system very unusual because this disk has somehow been maintained or created around a presumably old subdwarf binary .",
    "@xmath43 values used in figure  [ fig : mlr ] for gj 704 a and b do not include any adjustment for obscuration by the disk , which is likely to be minimal .",
    "if such an adjustment is required , the points would move to brighter @xmath43 , and the locations of the points would be towards even lower metallicity .",
    "the remaining subdwarfs systems generally fall along the low metallicity curves . because of the large mass errors of hip 85209 ab and hip 95575 ab measured by @xcite , it is difficult to make a direct comparison between observations and models .",
    "@xcite reported a metallicity for hip 85209 ab ( hd 157948 ab ) of [ m / h]=@xmath20.75 , whereas @xcite reported [ m / h]=@xmath20.5 .",
    "@xcite measured the dynamical masses of these subdwarfs using fgs , and determined via comparisons to the theoretical yale - yonsei models that the system should have metallicity close to @xmath20.5 .",
    "we note that the mass errors for hip 85209 a and b are relatively large , so these two stars do not place strict constraints on the models .",
    "finally , both components in the new system described in this paper , g 006 - 026 b and c , merge with points for main sequence stars with solar metallicity in the mlr .",
    "this presents a conflict with the low metallicity measurements discussed in section  [ sec : intro ]  the points should lie near the [ m / h ] = @xmath20.5 or @xmath21.0 lines in figure 7 .",
    "for example , @xcite used high s / n echelle spectrograph to determine the metallicity of the primary in the system g6 - 26a , which is also a sb2 binary with a period of 8.7 days @xcite .",
    "they discussed the challenges of measuring the metallicities of sb2 binaries in detail , but there is no flag of the system regarding quality of their result of [ m / h ] = @xmath20.88 . @xcite and @xcite used photometry of the unresolved primary to determine [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.52 and @xmath20.60 , respectively , thereby providing results that are match carney s , again indicating that the system is metal - deficient .    in order to move the masses of b and c components to the low metallicity region , b component s mass would need to be reduced to @xmath60.3 m@xmath35 ( 62.7% of 0.478 m@xmath35 ) to fall on the @xmath57 metallicity curve on figure  [ fig : mlr ] . in kepler s third law , such a mass decrease requires that the semi - major axis drop by 15% .",
    "there would then be a corresponding reduction in the projected separation ( @xmath25 ) measured using fgs .",
    "figure  [ fig : fakes ] shows an example of changing the projected separation along the x - axis by 15% while comparing to our best fitted s - curve .",
    "note the poor fit to the fgs data , compared to the much better correct fit .",
    "in addition , because our orbital parallax matches that from hipparcos , it is difficult to change the semi - major axis of this system from our derived value of 10.8 mas . given that it is hard to dispute the three independent metallicty measurements or shrink the separation between b and c , we are left with no easy answer to the conundrum that that two points do not fall on the mlr where they should .",
    "given the overall trend that subdwarf systems are elevated in the mass - luminosity relation and match with the model , but there are several confounding factors that challenge observational programs focusing on mapping the mass - luminosity relation for subdwarfs , including ( 1 ) metallicity errors may be large because all available subdwarf binaries have separations less than 1 , so the acquired spectra used to determine metallicities are for two objects , not one , with consequent complications when measuring linewidths ( g 006 - 026 ab is the only system to have an early type primary , which can be used to determine metallicity independently . ) , ( 2 ) mass errors are large because subdwarfs are rare and further away than comparable main sequence systems in the solar neighborhood , so parallax errors are larger , ( 3 ) accurate @xmath44 measurements are not available for a few systems and conversions from other filters are imperfect ( although overall , this is not likely to be a major problem ) , ( 4 ) not all of the systems are of the same age , so comparison to a single isochrone for 6 gyr - old systems may not be appropriate .",
    "this work shows that building an empirical mass - luminosity relation for subdwarfs has just begun .",
    "only two subdwarf systems , @xmath58 ab and gj 704 ab , are clearly off the metallicity curves for main - sequence stars and have low mass errors , so there remains significant work to do in understanding the astrophysics that drives the locations of low metallicity stars on the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "we can make progress in our understanding of these galactic fossils , as well as the star formation history and mass distribution of stars in the milky way , by discovering more subdwarf binaries for which high - quality metallicities , luminosities , and masses can be measured .",
    "vs @xmath47 from 51 binaries in washington double star catalog .",
    "the solid straight line is a fit ( @xmath59 ) for these points . ]",
    "cas ab and filled boxes represent the two systems discussed in detail in this paper , gj 704 ab and g 006 - 026 bc .",
    "the thick solid line represents the main - sequence isochrone for age 1 gyr from bt - settl @xcite .",
    "the three other lines represent the predicted locations of stars with metallicities of [ m / h]=@xmath20.5 , @xmath21.0 and @xmath22.0 at an age of 6 gyr from bottom to top , taken from @xcite ]    0.3 m@xmath35 on the -0.5 theoretical metallicity line of the mass luminosity relation .",
    "clearly this is inconsistent with the observation . ]",
