    "x  ray emission is a universal property of efficiently accreting black holes ( bh ) and its origin is , most likely , compton up  scattering of the uv / euv disc emission in an x  ray corona of hot electrons ( e.g. haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "there are , however , a few examples of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) where the corona appears to emit x  rays much less efficiently than usual , with an x  ray output @xmath1  10100 times lower than that expected based upon the optical / uv emission properties . these are known as x  ray weak agn which often exhibit broad absorption lines ( bals ) in the uv , suggesting an absorption  driven interpretation of their x  ray weakness ( brandt , laor & wills 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , x  ray absorption has been convincingly detected in a number of bal quasars ( e.g. brinkmann et al .",

    "2001 , 2004 ; mathur et al . 2001 ; chartas et al . 2002 , 2007 , 2009 ) .    however , a growing number of x  ray weak quasars do not show any detectable bals in their uv spectra ( e.g. wu et al .",
    "studied case is that of phl  1811 ( leighly et al .",
    "2001 , 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "this quasar has been observed several times in x ",
    "rays and is persistently x  ray weak .",
    "its x  ray spectrum shows no sign of absorption of a higher level x  ray flux , so that phl  1811 appears to be intrinsically x  ray weak .",
    "the c  iv emission line is weak , blueshifted and asymmetric , indicating the presence of a wind .",
    "the near  uv spectrum is dominated by fe  ii and fe  iii emission  line blends and unusually low  ionisation lines .",
    "leighly et al .",
    "( 2007b ) demonstrated , using detailed photo ",
    "ionisation modelling , that the optical / uv emission lines are consistent with a wind plus disc scenario in which c  iv is produced in the outflow while the low  ionisation lines ( e.g. mg  ii ) are associated with the denser disc at larger radii and see an ionising continuum filtered through the wind itself .",
    "indeed , a soft , x  ray weak ionising continuum can explain the unusual optical / uv line properties if filtering through the wind is considered for the disc  lines .",
    "the question in phl  1811 and similar sources is then whether the x  ray emission is intrinsically weak or due to intervening x  ray  only absorption .",
    "here we consider the case of phl  1092 which recently became one of the most extreme x  ray weak non  bal quasars known ( see below ) .",

    "the bolometric luminosity of phl  1092 is @xmath12  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "its uv spectrum shows relatively weak , broad , and blueshifted c  iv emission and presents many analogies with the prototypical non  bal x  ray weak quasar phl  1811 ( wu et al .",

    "the uv flux remained almost constant , resulting in a significant steepening of the optical  to  x  ray slope @xmath2 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and showing that even extreme x  ray weakness can in fact be a transient phenomenon .",
    "simultaneous optical spectra from mg  ii to h@xmath13 did not reveal significant changes with respect to historical ones allowing us to exclude the presence of a mg  ii bal .",
    "in order to shed light on the x  ray weakness phenomenon in non  bal quasars , we have monitored phl  1092 , obtaining three observations with _ xmm  newton _",
    "since 2008 , and another optical spectrum which is quasi  simultaneous with our last x  ray pointing in 2010 .",
    "we report here results from our monitoring campaign spanning almost 10  yr in total in the activity of the source .",
    "our observations provide simultaneous uv and x  ray data with which we follow the long  term x  ray and optical / uv variability of this remarkable source .",
    "we consider a series of physically motivated models that can reproduce the uv  to  x  ray data at the different probed x  ray flux levels , and we discuss the implications of our results in the context of non  bal x  ray weak quasars .",
    "phl  1092 was observed with _ xmm  newton _ on 6 occasions .",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations provide simultaneous photometric data in the uv via the om . the x  ray and uv monochromatic fluxes from all _ xmm - newton _ observations are reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the monochromatic 2  kev ( rest  frame ) flux varies by a factor @xmath1  260 between observations xmm(2 ) and xmm(3 ) .",
    "the uv variations , however , have much smaller amplitude and they are not strongly correlated with the x  ray ones .",
    "in fact , the maximum uv variation is a @xmath1  15% drop of the 1519    ( rest  frame ) monochromatic flux between observations xmm(3 ) and xmm(4 ) , accompanied by an x  ray flux increase by a factor @xmath1  4.2 .",
    "the presence of simultaneous uv and x  ray data allows us to derive reliably the optical  to  x  ray slope @xmath2 from 2000 to 2010 .",

    "our monitoring observations of phl  1092 show that the source has recovered part of its x  ray flux since 2008 .",

    "[ histdalpha ] we show @xmath20 as a function of the 2  kev monochromatic flux .",
    "the almost perfect linear correlation with @xmath26 shows that the @xmath2 variability of phl  1092 can be entirely explained in terms of its long  term x  ray flux changes .",
    "the uv flux is almost constant ( within 10% of its mean value ) , indicating that the large @xmath2 variability of phl  1092 has little to do with mass accretion rate variations , and is instead related to physical processes affecting the x  ray part of the sed only .",
    "notice that @xmath20 can be used to obtain the factor f@xmath27 by which a given quasar is x  ray weak via f@xmath28 .",

    "as mentioned above , we obtained optical spectra with the hobby ",

    "the 2008 observation was also complemented by a second optical spectrum taken on 2008 february 14 at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) to cover the mg  ii region .",
    "below , we start our discussion of the optical / uv properties of phl  1092 with a qualitative analysis of the properties of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) spectrum of phl  1092 obtained in 2003 .",
    "phl  1092 was observed with the hst space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis , ) on 2003 august 20 and 2003 september 18 , about one and two months after the xmm(2 ) observation .",
    "the observations were performed with the g140l and g230l gratings covering the 11503180    spectral range .",

    "the high  ionisation c  iv emission line of phl  1092 is much weaker than in the average quasar .",
    "the c  iv line is also broad and highly blueshifted with virtually no contribution at the line s rest  frame wavelength ( see wu et al .",
    "inspection of the optical spectrum of phl  1092 taken at the wht on 2008 february 14 reveals that the low  ionisation mg  ii emission line is instead centred at its rest  frame wavelength and is relatively narrow , with a likely smaller contribution from a broad blueshifted component .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ hstcomp ] shows a comparison of the c  iv and mg  ii line profiles in velocity space .",
    "the two observations are not simultaneous . c  iv is from the 2003 hst observation while mg  ii is from our 2008 february 14 observation with the wht .",
    "the purpose of showing here the hst spectrum of phl  1092 and the remarkably different line profiles of c  iv and mg  ii is to associate phl  1092 with other likely similar sources .",
    "the unusual uv emission ",
    "line properties of phl  1092 match those of the prototypical intrinsically x  ray weak quasar phl  1811 ( leighly et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ) , and of the two strong fe  ii emitters and relatively x  ray weak nls1 galaxies 1h  0707495 and iras  132243809 ( leighly & moore 2004 ; leighly 2004 ) .",
    "leighly ( 2004 ) associates the broad , blueshifted , high  ionisation lines ( e.g. c  iv ) with a wind , while the narrow , rest - frame , low  ionisation lines are likely produced in the denser disc or at the base of the wind itself .",
    "the lack ( or extreme weakness ) of any narrow c  iv emission line at the rest ",
    "frame wavelength in all these sources suggests that the continuum irradiating the narrow and low  ionisation line  emitting region has been filtered through the wind , thus supporting the idea that mg  ii and similar low ",
    "ionisation lines are emitted further away than the wind launching site , which leighly estimates to be @xmath31 for 1h  0707495 and iras  132243809 .",
    "most of the peculiar optical / uv properties of phl  1811 , 1h  0707495 and iras  132243809 can be explained with a soft ionising sed depleted of x  ray photons and , at least in the case of the two latter nls1 galaxies , by enhanced metallicity ( leighly 2004 ; leighly et al .",
    "the situation seems similar in phl  1092 : we observe weak , blueshifted c  iv emission , likely produced in a wind .",
    "no narrow c  iv emission line at rest ",
    "frame wavelength is observed , while mg  ii is relatively strong and narrow , supporting a filtered continuum in phl  1092 as well .",
    "the c  iv emission line properties of phl  1092 strongly suggest the presence of a wind in august / september 2003 , i.e. the epoch of the hst observation . considering the wind launching radius estimated by leighly for 1h  0707495 and",
    "iras  132243809 , the physical distance of the wind from the centre is @xmath32  light days in phl  1092 . , see e.g. nikoajuk , czerny & gurynowicz ( 2009 ) . ]",
    "hence , taking into account this timescale , the c  iv emission corresponds to a nuclear sed which is likely similar to that we observe in july 2003 during xmm(2 ) , when phl  1092 was not x  ray weak ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we conclude that a wind in phl  1092 can likely be launched even if the source is only moderately ( or even not at all ) x  ray weak .",
    "all uv fluxes obtained with the om during our monitoring show signs of modest long  term variability , with a tendency of lower variability amplitude at longer wavelengths ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the last three _ xmm  newton _",
    "observations have exposures in multiple filters . the variability trend above 1655",
    "  ( m2 filter ) is for a higher flux in xmm(4 ) a decrease in xmm(5 ) and a final rise in xmm(6 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the trend for the shortest wavelength w2 filter is , surprisingly , the opposite .",
    "it is crucial to note that the om filter w2 has an effective rest ",
    "frame wavelength of 1519   , which coincides with the wing of the ( blueshifted ) c  iv emission line of phl  1092 .    in fig .",
    "[ phl_om ] we show the hst spectrum of phl  1092 in the restricted region around the c  iv emission line on which we over  plot the monochromatic om fluxes from the w2 ( 1519 ) and m2 ( 1655 ) filters for the three observations with multiple  filter exposures .",
    "as the hst spectrum was obtained at a time when phl  1092 was most likely not particularly x  ray weak , we have re  normalised the hst spectrum to the om photometry of the least x  ray weak observation xmm(5 ) . as can be seen , the hst spectral shape is consistent with the om photometry during xmm(5 ) and xmm(6 ) , as shown by the open diamonds and filled squares in fig .",
    "[ phl_om ] . on the other hand",
    ", this is not the case for the x  ray weakest observation xmm(4 ) , in which the two om filters have a flux consistent with each other ( open circles in the figure ) .",
    "this comparison suggests significant uv spectral variability .",
    "in particular , our result suggests that the c  iv emission line was either much fainter or more blueshifted during the x  ray weak state observation xmm(4 ) .",
    "both possibilities ( and of course a combination of them ) can explain the difference between the hst spectral shape and the om photometry during xmm(4 ) . in fact , there are numerous suggestions in the literature that the c  iv line equivalent width ( ew ) is anti  correlated with its blueshift ( e.g. richards et al",
    ". 2011 ) and that sources with smaller c  iv ew ( and/or larger blueshift ) are typically x  ray weaker or _ soft  spectrum _ objects ( wu et al .",
    "2009 ; kruczek et al .",
    "2011 ; richards et al . 2011 ) .",
    "our result suggests that the idea that x  ray weaker quasars have lower c  iv ew and larger c  iv blueshift possibly holds not only statistically in large agn samples , but also in individual sources such as phl  1092 .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of multiple  filter exposures during the x  ray weakest observation xmm(3 ) prevents any further analysis of the issue . a uv spectrum of phl  1092 during an extreme x  ray weak epoch would clearly solve this important issue .      the 2008 het and wht optical spectra of phl  1092 from mg  ii to h@xmath13 were presented and qualitatively discussed by miniutti et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",

    "after a few tests , we found that the absorber column density and covering fraction can not be simultaneously constrained .",
    "we then decided to force a marginally compton  thick column density of n@xmath75  @xmath39 in all observations and let the covering fraction vary .",

    "in the previous sections , we have assumed that the soft x  ray excess is produced by compton up  scattering of the uv / euv disc photons in an optically thick corona with temperature @xmath90  kev .",
    "this interpretation of the soft excess has been freqeuntly questioned by many different authors ( e.g. gierliski & done 2004 ) because , in order to reproduce the uniform spectral shape in samples of agn with significantly different bh mass and eddington ratio , the electron temperature must be remarkably uniform .",
    "the uniform soft excess shape may indicate that processes that are independent of accretion physics are instead at play .",
    "below , we explore two spectral models in which the soft x  ray excess is either an apparent feature due to intervening absorption or a real extra emission component due to x  ray reflection off the inner accretion disc .",

    "we use exactly the same model as above but we force the x  ray corona to only power the high  energy power  law by fixing @xmath92 in all observations . this model eliminates the optically thick x  ray corona generating the soft excess which has thus to be explained with a different process . in this case",
    "we assume that the soft x  ray excess is not a real extra emission component , but rather an apparent feature due to deep absorption troughs affecting the intermediate x  ray energy band ( @xmath93  kev ) .",
    "the model , however , does not reproduce the data ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "even if the gaussian absorption line is replaced with a highly ionised outflowing absorber , the quality of the fit remains unaceptable , and the power law photon index reaches an implausibly high value of @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the only way to obtain a fair description of the data within this model is to allow for a large intrinsic x  ray flux variation , i.e. for a variation in the corona size set by r@xmath43 . in this context , as the intrinsic flux varies , we also leave the absorber(s ) ionisation free to vary .",
    "this approach produces a fit with good statistical quality ( @xmath96 ) , and the soft excess is reproduced .",
    "however , the model implies that the intrinsic x  ray flux of phl  1092 changes by a factor @xmath1  250 between the highest and lowest flux states .",
    "moreover , the ionisation state of the absorbers does not follow the unabsorbed flux , although this may be understood by considering that the ionising flux may intercept clouds of different density and/or distance at different times .",
    "the model fails at reproducing via absorption effects any of the observed x  ray flux and @xmath2 variability ; it is just a modified version of the baseline model .",
    "the only difference between the present and baseline models is in the description of the nature of the soft excess rather than in the mechanism behind the extreme x - ray variability .",

    "the key point is that the actual reflection flux change is only a factor @xmath1  10 between the two flux states and not the factor @xmath1  260 observed at 2  kev ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "the flux change is larger than two orders of magnitude at soft x ",

    "tracing simulations , the x  ray spectrum becomes increasingly reflection  dominated as the x  ray primary source location approaches the bh ( see miniutti et al . 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) . in the case of a kerr bh , for any distance @xmath110 , the flux irradiating the disc is always at least twice that escaping at infinity so that reflection ",
    "dominated spectra are produced .",
    "we propose that the x  ray corona in phl  1092 is confined within a few gravitational radii from the bh and that light ",
    "bending effects are responsible for the observed reflection  dominated spectrum .",
    "let us now consider the appearance of phl  1092 in the absence of light  bending effects , for the standard case in which the x  ray corona is not confined to the strong field regime close to the bh . in such a situation 50% of the emitted x  ray flux is directed away from the disc and detected as the x  ray continuum flux @xmath111 .",
    "the remaining 50% irradiates the disc with a flux @xmath112 and the spectrum is not reflection  dominated .",

    "we can estimate the total flux that would be observed in the absence of light  bending effects , where the spectrum is not reflection  dominated and the disc subtends a solid angle of @xmath120 at the source .",
    "it turns out that the total ( continuum + reflection ) flux density at 2  kev in the absence of light ",
    "bending effects is higher than the observed ( reflection only ) by a factor @xmath1  70 during the low flux state and by a factor @xmath1  9 during the high flux one .",

    "a final word of caution must be placed on the values of bh mass and eddington ratio we have assumed .",
    "we have adopted the best  fitting values of our baseline model for a kerr bh , but this approach is not entirely correct .",

    "ray reflection spectrum itself contributes in the uv / euv down to the ( rather uncertain ) energy where comptonization is efficient in producing the irradiating x  ray power law .",
    "the uv outflow also certainly contributes via scattering to the uv flux . in summary",
    ", we caution that the bh mass estimated with our baseline model could actually over  estimate the true value because our model attributes the uv emission entirely to the thermal accretion disc , while other contributions are possible ( if not likely ) .",

    "[ xmmlcs ] in the 0.31.43  kev band ( @xmath1  0.42  kev in the rest  frame ) .",
    "the soft band is selected because the low  flux observations are background  dominated above @xmath1  2  kev ( rest  frame ) and because the count rate drops rapidly with energy due to the steep spectrum of phl  1092 , making it difficult to study the hard x  ray variability even at the highest x  ray flux levels .. we show observations xmm(2 ) , xmm(4 ) , and xmm(6 ) , as they are representative of the typical x  ray variability in high , low , and intermediate flux states , respectively .",

    "the resulting rms variability as a function of x  ray flux ( count rate ) is shown in fig .",

    "this behaviour has indeed been observed in a number of agn and , especially , in those with large variability amplitudes such as the nls1 galaxies ngc  4051 and 1h  0707495 ( see examples of prolonged low flux states in fig .  1 of vaughan et al .",
    "2011 , and fig .  1 of fabian et al 2012 ) .",
    "the lack of variability during prolonged low  flux states and the extreme variability amplitude during high  flux intervals are just opposite extremes of the linear rms  flux relationship .",

    "our baseline and reflection spectral models are associated with large and moderate intrinsic variability respectively .",
    "as such , a rms  flux linear relationship has to be expected .",
    "on the other hand , this is not the case for the absorption model , as most ( if not all ) of the long  term x  ray variability is attributed to absorption changes .",

    "the only way to lower the bh mass from spectral fitting would be to consider that the optical / uv fluxes are contaminated or even dominated by a different emission component .",

    "this may be relevant for our reflection  dominated model ( which prefers the kerr solution , hence a likely too large bh mass ) for which a significant contribution of reprocessing to the uv flux has to be expected . in summary , if reprocessing is important , the bh mass derived from our spectral fits to the uv and x  ray data is likely over  estimated .",
    "however , the lack of a self - consistent disc reprocessing model ( thermal plus reflection ) from optical / uv to x  rays , and of a reliable model for the wind scattering contribution to the uv continuum , does not allows us to robustly infer reliable bh mass estimates within this scenario .",
    "the short  timescale x  ray variability of phl  1092 can also be used to constrain the x  ray corona size under the assumption that the variability is intrinsic ( if not , the coronal size derived below has to be considered as a lower limit ) . as can be seen in fig .",

    "as this happens in 16.5  ks in the rest ",

    "this result is obviously highly model  dependent as by construction the only way in which the model can produce variable x ",
    "ray output at fixed eddington ratio is by varying the x  ray corona size .",
    "any model able to account for large x  ray variability and almost constant optical / uv emission would be successful .",
    "however , the model is reasonably self  consistent and provides an elegant solution in terms of a breathing x  ray corona for @xmath2 variation that is entirely driven by x  ray flux variability , as is the case in phl  1092 ( see fig .",
    "[ histdalpha ] ) .",
    "the model accounts for the soft excess in terms of comptonization of the soft disc photons in the optically thick corona .",
    "its electron temperature is similar to that inferred from the analysis of the soft excess in the vast majority of type  1 agn . as such",
    ", it remains to be seen whether this remarkably uniform electron temperature in accreting bh spanning orders of magnitude in bh mass and eddington ratio can be physically explained .    in both the schwarzschild and kerr cases ,",
    "the observed @xmath178 implies a radial shrinking of the x  ray corona outer radius with a radial velocity of @xmath179  km  s@xmath8 , increasing to @xmath180  c if the model also needs to explain the short  timescale x  ray variability of phl  1092 .",
    "this suggests that the corona is not actually physically shrinking , but that the heating mechanism ( likely associated with magnetic fields ) is occurring in more localised sites during low  flux states .",
    "notice that the very compact x ",
    "ray corona in low  flux states would also imply that light ",
    "bending effects can no longer be neglected , likely producing a strong reflection contribution off the inner accretion disc . as such ,",
    "the model is not entirely self  consistent .",
    "however , the relatively limited quality of the data does not allow us to include the disc reflection component into the baseline model without over  modelling the x  ray data .",
    "the absorption model is based on the idea that the observed dramatic x  ray flux variability is not intrinsic but is due to intervening absorption .",
    "indeed , we find an attractive solution in which the intrinsic x  ray flux of phl  1092 is constant as is the uv flux ( and hence the accretion rate ) .",
    "the observed variability can be entirely explained in terms of a relatively cold absorber ( with @xmath181 ) with varying covering fraction .",
    "the absorber covers @xmath1  19% of the x  ray corona in high x  ray flux states and almost 100% of it in low flux ones .",
    "it should be pointed out that such a low  ionization absorber should imprint absorption features in the uv , which are not seen in the hst spectrum .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section  [ wider ] .",
    "remarkably , the intrinsic ( constant ) x  ray flux of phl  1092 in the absorption scenario is consistent with that expected for a quasar with the phl  1092 optical luminosity .",
    "hence , within the absorption  dominated scenario , phl  1092 is an intrinsically standard quasar with @xmath182 .",
    "an absorption feature at @xmath1  1.5  kev in the rest ",
    "frame is also seen and can not be produced by the relatively low  ionisation absorber .",
    "if the feature is identified with the fe  l complex , it implies the presence of a second absorbing phase with relatively high  ionisation and highly relativistic outflow velocity ( of the order of @xmath180  c ) .",
    "such a highly relativistic outflow velocity may be shared by the cold absorber as well .",
    "in fact , if we make the strong requirement that the model must be able to reproduce also the short - timescale x  ray variability of phl  1092 with covering fraction changes , a similar outflow velocity must be invoked for the cold absorber as well . on the other hand ,",
    "such velocity makes it difficult to account naturally for the fact that the two subsequent observations xmm(3 ) and xmm(4 ) , separated by @xmath85  yr in the rest  frame , share an almost identical covering fraction ( of @xmath183  % ) .",
    "this prolonged low flux state is at odds with the typical absorber variability properties which would predict a @xmath184 over a @xmath85  yr timescale .    in summary",
    ", the absorption model can explain the variability of phl  1092 on long  timescales but requires the extremely x  ray weak states to be somewhat exceptional as they are clear outliers and do not match the typical absorption variability properties on long  timescales .",
    "the bottom line is that the low flux states last too long to match the typical covering fraction rate of change . in fact , excursions into relatively prolonged low flux states are a common characteristic of agn with large variability amplitude and obeying a linear rms  flux relationship , which we suggest exists in phl  1092 as well .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a self  consistent absorption model is able to induce a linear rms  flux relationship , thus explaining the prolonged low flux states in the absorption scenario .",
    "on the other hand , the baseline and reflection models , which are both associated with intrinsic x  ray flux variability , are naturally coupled to the linear rms  flux relationship ( which predicts prolonged low  flux states ) , so that they may be regarded as less problematic in this respect .",
    "a reflection  dominated model represents a plausible alternative to the scenarios discussed above .",
    "we are able to reproduce the observed factor @xmath1  260 variation at 2  kev by only invoking a factor @xmath1  10 change in the intrinsic x  ray flux , coupled with associated disc ionisation changes .",
    "the excellent correlation between the disc ionisation and the total reflection flux ( proportional to that irradiating the disc ) ensures that the model is self  consistent .",
    "ionised disc reflection also provides a natural explanation for the soft x ",
    "ray excess with no need for comptonization in an optically thick corona , which is not the case for any of the above models .",
    "the model implies that phl  1092 appears predominantly x  ray weak because its x  ray corona is extremely compact and centrally concentrated , within a few @xmath185 from the bh .",
    "such compact corona also self - consistently predicts reflection  dominated spectra because of light  bending effects . in absence of light  bending , phl  1092 would in fact appear as a non  x - ray weak quasar with a residual @xmath2 variation due to to moderate intrinsic x  ray variability ( a factor 10 in 3.2  yr in the rest  frame ) .",
    "the reflection model can explain both the long and short  timescale x  ray variability of phl  1092 with relatively modest intrinsic flux changes . as the model is associated with intrinsic variability , the ( tentative ) linear rms  flux relationship we suggest to exist in phl  1092 comes as no surprise . hence the relatively prolonged low ",
    "flux state ( lasting @xmath85  yr ) can be seen simply as a consequence of the rms  flux linear relationship ( i.e. of the log  normal distribution of fluxes ) .",
    "phl  1092 shares many common properties in the optical / uv with the prototypical non  bal x  ray weak quasar phl  1811 ( see also the case of lbqs  0102 - 2713 , boller , schady & heftrich 2011 ) .",

    "filtering of the ionising flux through the wind also explains the lack of high  ionisation lines in the disc component which is then located at a greater distance from the bh than the wind launching site .",
    "the implication is that the belr sees a soft x  ray weak sed which may be intrinsic to these sources ( as in our baseline model ) , due to absorption , or induced by light ",

    "if the typical spectrum of the phl  1811 analogs is indeed harder than usual , it may be related either to intervening absorption or to the presence of a reflection  dominated spectrum , two of the models that we consider here for phl  1092 and that have been suggested by wu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for the phl  1811 high  redshift analogs .",
    "if absorption is invoked , the material must lie closer to the central bh than the belr ( say that for mg  ii ) so that the ionising continuum is effectively x  ray weak thus explaining the observed optical / uv emission line properties ( see leighly 2004 ) . on the other hand , uv disc photons",
    "should not be affected , as no absorption is seen in the uv spectrum .",
    "the x  ray absorber could be naturally associated with the putative shield which is often invoked in outflow models not to over  ionise the gas at the base of the outflow , thus enabling acceleration ( e.g. murray et al .",

    ", the uv emission from the extended disc would always be affected , independently of the specific line  of  sight .",
    "hence , such simulations may not be totally relevant for the case of agn with no absorption signatures in the uv .    the lack of uv absorption in phl  1092 ( and the presence of the broad , blueshifted c  iv emission line ) most likely indicates that our line  of  sight only crosses the highly  ionised outflow polar zones , so that no absorption features are imprinted in the uv . according to the work of schurch , done & proga ( 2009 ) , which is based on the wind simulations by proga & kallman ( 2004 ) , polar lines  of  sight are characterised by high ionisation , while equatorial ones by cold absorption ( i.e. equatorial lines  of - sight intercept the gas responsible for the shielding ) . a pole  on line  of  sight into the wind funnel would indeed be consistent with the detected blueshifted c  iv emission line .",
    "let us now consider whether the x  ray  only absorber we infer from our absorption  model is consistent with this picture .",
    "the flux variability and transient x  ray weakness of phl  1092 is due to the variation of the covering fraction of a relatively cold absorber with @xmath181 .",

    "such low  ionisation is only achieved for equatorial lines  of  sight ( say @xmath189 , see fig .  1 of their work ) .",
    "this means that we would be intercepting the denser part of the outflow ( basically the shielding gas ) , which conflicts with the fact that no absorption features are imprinted in the uv ( dominated instead by broad and blueshifted emission lines ) .",

    "ray absorber associated with the lack of uv absorption represents a problem for the absorption scenario , as detailed by wu et al .",

    "let us assume an absorber confined within a fiducial radius of @xmath190 , so that the uv emission from within that region is small and the uv spectrum does not present any absorption feature .",
    "our absorption model is based on the code , and the ionisation parameter is defined as @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the gas number density , @xmath34 its distance from the ionising source , and @xmath193 the ionising luminosity between 1 and 1000  ry .",

    "hence the absorption model we propose is not self  consistent as the low ",
    "ionisation gas detected in absorption ( and needed to reproduce the x  ray flux variability ) can not survive in the compact region that is necessary to avoid significantly affecting the uv .",

    "for instance , one can imagine a situation in which the absorbing cloud(s ) have a multi  layer structure .",
    "the outer layers are highly ionised and reduce via absorption and compton scattering , the ionising luminosity irradiating the inner layers .",
    "if so , the cloud(s ) core could possibly survive with relatively low ionisation even very close to the ionising source .",
    "this hypothesis would require consideration of a multi  layer absorption model in which compton scattering is self  consistently taken into account , which also means considering with care all possible outflow geometries / velocities .",
    "given the limited quality of our x - ray data , we must defer this study to future higher quality observations of phl  1092 or of other similar ( x  ray brighter ) sources .    if a reflection  dominated spectrum is invoked , the overall optical / uv to x  ray sed is intrinsically steep as the ionising continuum is x  ray depleted and , as such , the unusual optical / uv emission line properties of phl  1092 and other similar sources can be explained .",
    "we attribute this effect to light  bending close to the bh which depresses very significantly the continuum flux that can escape to an observer at infinity .",
    "our analysis of phl  1092 shows that a reflection  dominated spectrum due to the presence of a very compact and centrally concentrated x  ray corona ( few @xmath185 in size ) can indeed produce extreme x  ray weak states as well as dramatic x  ray variability in the soft band by invoking much lower amplitude variation in the intrinsic x  ray flux .",

    "a recent observation of 1h  0707495 ( fabian et al . 2012 ) suggests that the x  ray corona is confined within @xmath201 from the central bh during extremely low x  ray flux states , while it is likely more extended during higher x  ray flux states , in agreement with light  bending model predictions ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , soft x  ray time lags of the order of the light  crossing time of a few @xmath185 have been detected in 1h  0707495 , and their properties ( energy and frequency dependence ) support the overall interpretation in terms of disc reflection ( fabian et al . 2009 ; zoghbi et al .",
    "2010 ; zoghbi , uttley & fabian al .",
    "it should be mentioned that , although no complete spectral  timing model has been presented , the properties of 1h  0707495 have been suggested to be consistent with an absorption  dominated interpretation , which , however , may require a special line  of sight ( miller et al .",
    "the detection of time  lags in several other sources appears to exclude the possibility that we are dealing with such special lines  of  sight ( e.g. emmanoulopoulos , mchardy & papadakis 2011 ; tripathi et al .",
    "2011 ; zoghbi & fabian 2011 ; zoghbi et al .",

    "gibson , brandt & schneider ( 2008 ) showed that non  bal x  ray weak quasars make up less than about 12% of the optically selected quasar population . on the other hand , wu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported that the fraction of phl  1811 analogs in the radio  quiet population is @xmath202  1.2% .",
    "it is reassuring that the fraction of agn that can be very strongly reflection  dominated is constrained to be @xmath202  2% by the hard x  ray cosmic background ( gandhi et al .",
    "2007 ) , although the cosmic x  ray background sources are likely in a different luminosity regime from the sdss quasars considered by e.g. wu et al . ( 2011 ) .",
    "we have analysed _ xmm  newton _ observations of phl  1092 covering nearly 10  yr ( 7.5  yr in the rest  frame ) of its activity and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in soft x  ray flux .",
    "we complement our analysis with optical spectra obtained in january 2008 and october 2010 and with a qualitative discussion of the uv hst spectrum from a august / september 2003 stis observation .",
    "the main results of our analysis can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the remarkable @xmath2 variability of phl  1092 is entirely driven by the x  ray variability . during our monitoring campaign",
    ", we detect a maximum x  ray flux variability by a factor @xmath6 in @xmath1  3.5  yr ( rest  frame ) , while the uv variability is confined to within 1015% . at its minimum x  ray flux level ( january 2008 ) , phl  1092 is about a factor of @xmath203 x  ray weak with respect to a standard quasar with its optical luminosity .",
    "the uv spectrum of phl  1092 is characterised by weak , broad , and blueshifted c  iv emission , most likely originating in a wind .",
    "the lack of absorption features in the uv spectrum of phl  1092 most likely indicates that the outflow does not cross our line  of  sight , in contrast with the case of bal quasars .",
    "it presents many analogies with the prototypical non  bal x  ray weak quasar phl  1811 and with the two nls  1 galaxies 1h  0707495 and iras  132243809 .",
    "we tentatively report uv variability in the c  iv region based on a comparison between the single ",
    "epoch hst spectrum and the uv photometry from the _ xmm  newton _ om observations .",
    "the possible c  iv variability appears to be associated with x  ray weakness .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that the c  iv emission line is weaker and/or more blueshifted in x  ray weaker states .",
    "this implies either that the ionising flux drop associated with x  ray weak states is sufficient to depress the c  iv emission  line flux , or that the outflow can be launched from closer in during x  ray weak states , thus resulting in a larger outflow velocity and c  iv blueshift .",
    "the optical spectrum of phl  1092 is dominated by fe  ii , and is characterised by relatively narrow h@xmath13 and mg  ii lines centred at rest ",
    "frame energies , likely originating in the dense outer disc .",
    "no significant spectral changes are seen in the optical from 2008 to 2010 .",
    "the x  ray variability of phl  1092 on long and short  timescales suggests a correlation between the x  ray flux and the rms variability , consistent with the linear rms  flux relationship that has been now observed in almost all types of accreting objects .",
    "phl  1092 has a high variability amplitude on short ",
    "timescales which can be used to estimate its bh mass .",
    "the x  ray variability bh mass estimate is , however , about two orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained using the standard bh mass scaling relations using single  epoch optical spectra .",
    "this result calls into question either the idea that the mechanism behind the short - timescale variability of phl  1092 is the same as in all other accreting objects ( which would be surprising , given the rms  flux relation we suggest ) or the reliability of the standard mass scaling relations for wind  dominated _ soft  spectrum _ agn such as phl  1092 .",
    "we propose three possible scenarios that can explain the uv  to  x  ray sed of phl  1092 at all x  ray flux levels : i ) a _ breathing corona _ scenario in which the x  ray flux is correlated with the x  ray corona size and where x  ray weak states are associated with the collapse of the corona down to the marginal stable orbit ; ii ) an absorption model where the x  ray variability is dominated by changes of the covering fraction of a relatively cold absorber which covers almost 100% of the x  ray source in x  ray weak states ; iii ) a disc  reflection  dominated scenario where the x  ray corona is confined within few @xmath185 from the central bh at all flux levels .",
    "in the _ breathing corona _ scenario , the x  ray corona of phl  1092 is always compact ( @xmath204 ) and shrinks down to @xmath205 in extreme x  ray weak states . however , the shrinking radial velocity is likely too high to be plausible and , as such , we interpret the _ breathing corona _ as an indication that the x  ray active regions are more compact ( and likely closer in ) in low x  ray flux states .",
    "if so , we caution that light ",
    "bending effects will inevitably occur , so that the model reduces to the reflection  dominated one at least in extreme x  ray weak states .",
    "the absorption interpretation is not completely self  consistent as the x  ray flux variability is produced by variations of a relatively cold absorber .",
    "the absorber should imprint some absorption feature in the uv , but uv absorption is not detected in the spectra of phl  1092 , phl  1811 , the phl  1811 analogs of wu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , or the two nls  1 galaxies we consider .",
    "one possibility is that the absorber is confined within the uv  emitting disc , i.e. within a few tens of @xmath185 .",
    "if so , however , absorbing clouds can not survive at the low ionisation level we need to reproduce the x  ray variability .",
    "a possible way out would be to consider a multi  layer absorption model in which every absorbing cloud is structured into multiple layers .",
    "the outer layers may protect the innermost cloud(s ) nucleus from the ionising flux , thus enabling them to survive close to the source at low ionisation .",
    "we defer such complex study to future work .",
    "as mentioned , the x  ray variability and overall sed can also be reproduced in a reflection - dominated scenario where a compact x ",
    "ray corona is confined within few @xmath185 from the bh at all flux levels .",
    "bending effects produce a disc reflection  dominated spectrum , and the observed extreme x  ray flux variability at soft x  rays ( a factor @xmath206 in 3.5  yr ) is reproduced with a much smaller factor of @xmath5 intrinsic variation .",
    "a similar scenario has been invoked for 1h  0707495 and iras  132243809 , two nls  1 galaxies which share many properties with phl  1092 from uv to x  rays .",
    "the recent detection of soft x ",
    "ray time lags in 1h  0707495 ( and other sources ) supports a reflection scenario in these objects .",
    "two of the the three scenarios we present make very different predictions for the x  ray flux above 10  kev .",
    "the absorption model implies a constant flux @xmath207  erg  @xmath39  s@xmath8 in the 30100  kev band , while the reflection",
    " dominated model predicts a much lower flux .",
    "] of @xmath208  erg  @xmath39  s@xmath8 on the other hand , as the baseline model is associated with very large intrinsic variability , the predicted hard x  ray flux is too variable to provide a useful constraint . a deep observation of phl  1092 ( or of a similar source ) with sensitive hard x  ray detectors such as _ astro  h _ ( takahashi et al . 2010 ) and _ nustar _ ( harrison et al . 2010 ) in the near future",
