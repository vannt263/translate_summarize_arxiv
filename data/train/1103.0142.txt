    "thermally induced gas flow and knudsen forces arising from the unbalanced momentum flux in a gas are among the most interesting phenomena in a rarefied gas with a non - uniform temperature field .",
    "the rapidly developing micromachining technologies have made it possible to observe and apply these phenomena even at atmospheric conditions .",
    "for example , attractive and repulsive forces have been observed on heated microcantilevers in air  @xcite , and a passive micromachined gas pump utilizing thermal creep flow , entitled as the knudsen pump , has been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "the promising potential of these applications has called for a deeper understanding and study of transport phenomena in a rarefied gas .",
    "several experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to study the knudsen force on cantilevers  @xcite , radiometric forces  @xcite , and knudsen pumps  @xcite .",
    "most knudsen pumps proposed and developed up to now utilize thermal creep flow .",
    "the modeling of such flows dates back to 1879 when maxwell  @xcite derived a mathematical expression for the flow along a surface induced by a temperature gradient .",
    "since then , the corresponding thermal creep flow through ducts or channels has been demonstrated in many experiments .",
    "the flow velocity is proportional to the temperature gradient , potentially requiring very large temperature spans when the channel length is no longer small , which has limited the application perspectives of thermal creep flow .",
    "some attempts have been made to reduce the required temperature span by considering a gas between parallel surfaces with a periodic , step - like topography  @xcite .",
    "besides that , virtually no studies of transport phenomena in gases confined between two periodically structured surfaces seem to be available .",
    "( color online ) schematic of the two - dimensional channel geometry considered made of two surfaces with temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "different styles of the wall segments indicate different boundary conditions . on the right side , a corresponding geometry incorporating a wheel with suitable surface structures",
    "is sketched to suggest possible applications . , width=288 ]    it is well known that in a gas confined between two parallel isothermal walls of different temperatures no net mass and momentum fluxes parallel to the walls occur . however , as we will show in this article , with periodically structured surfaces it is possible to induce such fluxes .",
    "we consider a monoatomic gas governed by the boltzmann equation between two parallel surfaces equipped with periodic structures .",
    "the term `` structure '' has a twofold meaning . on the one hand",
    ", the surfaces can have a topography , on the other hand , there can be spatial modulations of the boundary condition expressing how a molecule gets reflected when impinging on a wall .",
    "we expect that especially when the knudsen number @xmath2 , being the ratio of the mean - free path of the molecules and the distance between the surfaces , is of the order of one or larger , the surface topography and the spatial modulation of the boundary condition should have a significant influence on the phase space distribution of the molecules inside the channel and the resulting transport phenomena .",
    "we are mainly interested in the total momentum and mass fluxes inside the gas that are created if the two surfaces are at different temperatures .",
    "the purpose of this work is to identify surface structures that are as simple as possible and nevertheless give rise to non - vanishing fluxes .",
    "the type of prototype geometry considered is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] together with the predicted directions of mass and momentum fluxes .",
    "the quantities of interest are the total momentum and mass fluxes in @xmath3-direction .",
    "it is clear that a non - vanishing flux along the @xmath3-direction will only result if the structure breaks the reflection symmetry with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "as will become evident in the following , it suffices to structure one of the two surfaces .",
    "the top wall will therefore be considered flat and uniform .",
    "specifically , we are interested in the total momentum in @xmath3-direction per unit time the gas transfers between the top and the bottom surface . to further simplify matters ,",
    "let us limit ourselves to the surface structures shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : manyfinsgeometry - notations ] . besides choosing @xmath4 ,",
    "the distribution of wall boundary conditions has been fixed .",
    "the red ( solid ) sections denote a diffuse reflection boundary condition , the blue ( dashed ) ones a specular reflection boundary condition , whose mathematical form will be detailed below . furthermore , for the time being we make the assumption that the mean - free path of the molecules is much larger than @xmath5 , i.e. we assume gas dynamics in the free - molecular flow regime .",
    "we always suppose that the thermal conductivity of the wall material is so large that temperature variations along the surfaces can be neglected .    assuming no external force fields acting on the molecules , in the limit @xmath6 the solution of the boltzmann equation can be reduced to tracing rays representing the paths of the molecules  @xcite .",
    "we give a sketch of the derivation based on the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 a point on the lower surface and by @xmath8 the distribution function of the incoming molecules incident with velocity @xmath9 on @xmath10 for those we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is inward normal at @xmath7 ( in this and the following the notation for the unit normals is analogous to the boundary points ) .",
    "the force exerted on the bottom surface by the incoming molecules is then : @xmath13 where the integration is over an arc length parameter @xmath14 through which the points at the bottom wall are defined via @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the recoil from the outgoing molecules at @xmath7 gives : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the phase space distribution of the outgoing molecules .",
    "the net force on the lower surface is then given by @xmath18    in the framework of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xmath8 is equal to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a point at the intersection of a straight line oriented along @xmath21 with the boundary .",
    "the point @xmath20 could be either on a diffusive or on a specular boundary , a situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : manyfinsgeometry - notations ] with the possibilities for @xmath20 exemplified by @xmath22 @xmath23 for the diffusive and by @xmath24 for the specular wall segments , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition on the wall segments with diffuse reflection of molecules is expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the molecular mass , @xmath27 the temperature of the wall at point @xmath28 ( in energy units ) , and the number of collisions from the incoming molecules at @xmath28 per unit length and unit time ( the particle flux ) @xmath29 has been factored out .",
    "this is a maxwell boundary condition  @xcite with an accommodation coefficient of one .",
    "the particle flux is defined in the usual way as : @xmath30    from particle number conservation we have @xmath31 from which the choice of the pre - exponential factor in eq .   is fixed .",

    "by similar tracing procedures we find the relevant relations for the distribution function in the equation for the recoil force eq .  .",
    "as a result , finding the phase space distribution of the molecules at points along the boundary of the domain essentially reduces to determining @xmath38 . for illustration ,",
    "a point @xmath7 at the bottom wall receives particles traced to either a diffusive or to a specular wall segment .",
    "the particle flux s definition then gives an integral equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the subset of incoming velocities @xmath9 for which the tracing routine relates the point @xmath7 to a point on a diffusive segment @xmath41 and similarly , @xmath42 denotes the subset of incoming velocities for which the tracing routine relates the @xmath7 to a point on the specular segment @xmath43 and eventually to a diffusive boundary point @xmath44 by direct substitution we find that this integral equation has a constant solution , i.e. @xmath45 , independent of position .    to proceed ,",

    "[ fig : manyfinsgeometry - notations ] . for close - by fins or for sufficiently large values of @xmath47 @xmath46 is positive , otherwise negative .",
    "this parameter allows to conveniently distinguish geometries such that a tracing procedure starting at @xmath7 and hitting the incline can only end at points on the top wall ( @xmath48 ) , and geometries for which the tracing after hitting the incline can end either on the top wall or on the vertical side wall of the lower surface ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "this shows that in the free - molecular flow regime a @xmath3-momentum flux in the gas and the corresponding force on the wall can not be created by virtue of the wall topography alone .    for comparison with the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have considered the ratio @xmath58 such a dimensionless ratio gives an immediate account of the expected magnitude of the effect , since @xmath59 is the pressure force onto the wall .",
    "for example , when the free - molecular flow regime is approximated by considering a gas in a nanochannel at standard conditions , the expression of eq .   is the force resulting from a pressure of one atmosphere .    to numerically solve the boltzmann equation ,",
    "monte carlo schemes were employed .",
    "either a time - splitting monte - carlo method  @xcite with a hard - sphere collision model or a standard direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method with variable hard sphere collision model  @xcite was used . both schemes",

    "molecules are initialized based on the average of the wall temperatures and the prescribed knudsen number . a gas - wall interaction model to compute the post - collision molecular velocities as specified previously in this article is employed .    in the case of the time - splitting method ( the data in figs .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter](a - b ) ) , error bars were computed based on three independent runs with @xmath60 particles per computational cell . following that , a richardson extrapolation to @xmath61 was performed , allowing to estimate the error by computing the difference to the @xmath62 result . in the case of the standard dsmc method ( the data in figs .",

    "both @xmath83 and @xmath84 were considered in the numerical studies .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter](c ) shows the dependence of the force ratio on the knudsen number .",
    "first of all it is worth noting that the analytical curves are well reproduced by the numerical data obtained for @xmath84 .",
    "when the knudsen number is decreased to one , the data points still follow the same trend , but the magnitude of the dimensionless force is reduced by about @xmath85 . we therefore conclude that the analytical solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation still makes qualitatively correct predictions in the transition flow regime .",
    "the asymmetry of the fins ( including the effect of the boundary condition ) is the origin of the @xmath3-momentum flux inside the gas and the corresponding force onto the walls .",
    "therefore it is expected that the maximum force values are obtained in a region around @xmath86 and that the force decreases as the fins become sparser .",
    "this is exactly the behavior displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter ] ( b ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter ] ( a ) shows that the force is in fact significant : at @xmath83 maximum values of well above @xmath87 are obtained . as expected , the force vanishes when the gas approaches a state where local thermal equilibrium prevails ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter ] ( c ) ) .",
    "the maximum force values are reached in the free molecular flow regime .    from an energetic point of view , when @xmath56 acts to displace the two parallel surfaces with respect to each other , heat is transformed into mechanical energy , as indicated in the schematic on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this is a novel energy conversion scheme that works without the usual volumetric expansion . rather than functioning in a cycle , it allows to continuously extract mechanical work from a temperature difference .",
    "in the limit @xmath88 where the force becomes maximal , the mass flux in the gas vanishes .",
    "such a scenario bears some analogy with results that have been obtained for closed domains  @xcite .",
    "it also shows that the force is not due to the shear stress caused by a fluid flowing over a surface . at @xmath84",
    "the phase space distribution of the gas is such that the expectation value of the @xmath3-momentum flux transferred between the walls is nonzero .",
    "the molecules emerging from the lower surface carry a negative @xmath3-momentum flux , corresponding to the positive value of @xmath56 the surface experiences . away from the limiting case of infinite knudsen number ,",
    "some of these molecules collide with other gas molecules , thereby transferring @xmath3-momentum to the gas .",
    "it is expected that by such a mechanism the gas in the upper portion of the domain into which the fins do not extend is set into motion .",
    "this picture suggests that the corresponding mass flux should be opposite to @xmath56 .",
    "one can also examine the picture from the other end of the gas regime . in the limit of @xmath89 ,",
    "the local equilibrium conditions ensure that both momentum and mass fluxes are zero and hence no force and mass flow exist .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , non - equilibrium conditions start to prevail .",
    "since the temperature gradient around the fin tips is likely to be the most significant , due to both the sharp tip and the asymmetric boundaries , one would expect that deviations from local thermal equilibrium first occur in these regions , resulting in a larger non - zero momentum flux compared to the gas in other regions .",
    "the flow induced by this momentum flux is then expected to have its maximum velocity near the tip and to gradually decrease towards the top wall , resulting in a flow pattern similar to couette flow .",
    "as @xmath2 increases further , the non - equilibrium region expands into the whole channel .",
    "the tip flow is no longer dominant and the flow pattern is dictated by the overall configuration of the channel .",
    "( color online ) the velocity field at @xmath90 .",
    "the background color ( grayscale ) contours indicate the corresponding temperature field.,width=326 ]    figure  [ fig : flow - rate ] displays numerical results for the average flow velocity as a function of @xmath2 . for these calculations a specific geometry with @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "was chosen ( the same geometry as for the next to last data point in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio - vs - parameter](a ) ) .",
    "as expected from the analytical results above and the navier - stokes limit of the boltzmann equation , there is no flow in the limits @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum average flow velocity occurs in the region around @xmath93 .",
    "the behavior at large knudsen numbers suggests that the mass flux can be interpreted as a perturbation effect to the zero mass flux , nonzero momentum flux phase space distribution derived in the previous section : the momentum transferred from particle - particle collisions sets the gas into motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : flow - pattern ] shows the flow pattern obtained at @xmath93 .",
    "the background color contours indicate the corresponding temperature field .",
    "the flow is in the negative @xmath3-direction and a couette - like flow pattern with the maximum velocity being near the fin tip is clearly visible , consistent with the simple picture drawn in the previous paragraph .",
    "significant flow velocities of close to @xmath94  m / s are reached , making the described principle relevant for the pumping of gases .",
    "we have studied the transport processes in a gas between a flat and a structured surface at different temperatures .",
    "we have shown that with suitably chosen surface structures , both a momentum and a mass flux parallel to the surfaces can be induced .",
    "the momentum flux takes its maximum values in the free - molecular flow regime , the mass flux ( in terms of the average velocity ) in the transition flow regime .",
    "while it is a priori clear that suitable structures need to break the reflection symmetry , a purely geometrical symmetry breaking based on diffusively reflecting walls is not sufficient .",
    "the observed fluxes only occur because a suitable texture comprising surface patches with diffuse and specular reflection conditions have been selected .",
    "the described effects may find applications in micro-/nanoscale energy converters and micro-/nanoscale pumping technology .",
