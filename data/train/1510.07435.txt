    "<S> this motivates the considerable effort that is being invested in the creation of the technological basis for these devices with the ultimate goal of constructing quantum devices that can outperform their classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main obstacles on this path is the effect of noise and decoherence due to interaction with an uncontrolled environment , the effect of which becomes increasingly severe as the number of system components grows . </S>",
    "<S> this poses a considerable challenge for achieving the quantum control of such systems while maintaining the quantum coherence of the system . </S>",
    "<S> hence noise control is central for the future development of scalable quantum technologies .    </S>",
    "<S> various theoretical concepts and proposals , e.g. quantum error correction @xcite , decoherence free subspace @xcite , and dynamical decoupling @xcite , have been developed for the suppression or avoidance of quantum decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> each of these methods are best suited for specific scenarios . for example </S>",

    "<S> one important example among others that suffer from non - collective noise is the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond @xcite as a promising physical system for quantum information processing and quantum sensing , the noise of which is dominated by the local nuclear and paramagnetic environment . </S>",
    "<S> these noise sources exhibit relatively long memory times and thus can be suppressed using continuous driving . </S>",
    "<S> this approach however suffers drawbacks for strong driving where intensity and phase fluctuations may become significant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important observation , that for decoupling fields that are derived from the same source , these fluctuations will be strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we propose to exploit this feature by pairing two driven systems into hybrid dressed states . </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap arising from continuous driving protects quantum coherence in non - markovian environments and makes it insusceptible to inhomogeneous local environment noise , while the pairing approach makes it robust against the driving fluctuation . in comparison with dynamical decoupling in decoherence free subspace , see e.g. @xcite , the present idea of hybrid dressed state provides new flexibility in the engineering of effective hamiltonian . with detailed numerical studies , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the present scheme can prolong coherence times by more than two orders of magnitude under realistic conditions . </S>",

    "<S> , we can introduce an additional rotated term which transforms the ising coupling to the xxz hamiltonian @xcite . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we use the single addressing ability of the focused co - propagating raman beams , to drive the dressed states off resonantly @xcite . the feasibility of this approach is carefully verified by our numerical simulation with realistic experiment parameters @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ in summary , we propose to implement high - fidelity quantum simulation using hybrid dressed state . </S>",
    "<S> its key advantage is the possibility for applying strong driving to suppress non - collective environment noise while at the same time the inevitable driving fluctuations are suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it provides new flexibility in the engineering of tunable coherent coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate theoretically the applicability of our scheme for noise resistant quantum simulation with nv centers in diamond , but would like to stress that it is sufficiently versatile to apply to a wide variety of physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that a proof - of - principle verification is readily achievable with trapped ions under state - of - the - art experiment capability . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be naturally combined with a wide range of applications such as quantum metrology / sensing and quantum computing . </S>",
