    "statistical mechanics provides a way to calculate the macroscopic properties of matter from the behavior of microscopic constituents . instead of considering all motions of the individual constituents ,",
    "one describes observable quantities averaged over constituent hamiltonian trajectories , and averages are evaluated using the probability distribution of possible microstates .",
    "likewise , fluid systems with a local balance between dissipation and forcing have been described by statistical mechanics with the inclusion of constraints based on invariants of the dynamics .",
    "in general , such statistical theories for fluids are based on the idea that the macroscopic behavior of the fluid turbulence can be described without knowing detailed information about small scale vortices .",
    "the justification of statistical mechanics based on ideal two - dimensional fluid equations is open to question , given the existence of forcing , dissipation , three - dimensional effects , temperature gradients , etc .",
    ", that certainly occur in real fluid flows .",
    "moreover , one must square the idea of cascading with the approach to statistical equilibrium .",
    "ultimately , such a justification is very difficult and would rely on delicate mathematical limits .",
    "however , its success amounts to the idea that the fluid system can in some sense be described by weakly interacting subsystems , where the behavior of a single subsystem can be described by weak coupling to a heat bath that embodies all of the other subsystems and all of the omitted effects . in the end ` the proof of the pudding is in the eating ' , and our justification is based on experimental observations .",
    "intimately related to the existence of subsystems is the question of which invariants to incorporate into a statistical mechanics treatment of fluids .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to investigate this question .",
    "we investigate this question both conceptually and experimentally and come to the conclusion that quadratic invariants ( energy and enstrophy ) are most important .",
    "our conclusion follows from the observation that these invariants possess the property of additivity .",
    "the microscopic dynamics of conventional statistical mechanics is finite dimensional , but to describe macrosopic phenomena one takes the thermodynamic limit in which the number of degrees of freedom tends to infinity .",
    "however , the dynamics of a two - dimensional fluid is already infinite dimensional and possesses an infinite number of invariants ; so , in order to make progress with a statistical mechanics approach one must extract a finite - dimensional model , and such a model can not conserve all of the invariants of the original fluid system . in calculations",
    "one may also take limits of this finite - dimensional model , but the results of these limits may depend upon which of the invariants are maintained .",
    "additivity of macroscopic invariants and statistical independence of subsystems are crucial properties in conventional statistical mechanics [ see e.g.  @xcite ] . because not all invariants of a system are additive , this property can be used to select invariants for statistical mechanics from the infinite number possessed by two - dimensional fluid systems .",
    "related to the choice of additive invariants is the choice of subsystems .",
    "this choice requires the identification of two scales , a macroscopic scale and a microscopic scale , which we call @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and phase space cells of these characteristic sizes are considered . in classical statistical mechanics ,",
    "the micro - cells usually refer to individual particles , while the macro - cells , the subsystems , are selected to be large enough to contain many particles yet small enough to have uniform invariants .",
    "we address in detail the choice of these cells for the fluid in  [ sec : mf ] , but it is clear that a macro - cell should contain many micro - cells , yet be small enough so that the vorticity and streamfunction are constant .",
    "this condition is sufficient for statistical independence , but the converse is not always true . in any event",
    "we seek to define macro - cells that are nearly statistically independent and consider only invariants that are additive over these cells .",
    "a second aim of the present work is to propose the idea that temporal mean values of the streamfunction provide a natural coordinate system for describing inhomogeneous turbulence , a coordinate system that can be used to define statistically independent subsystems .",
    "we suggest this idea because contours of the streamfunction for two - dimensional inviscid fluid flow tend to be smooth and because there tends to be a strong statistical dependence of vorticity or potential vorticity along those contours .",
    "streamfunction contours are much smoother than vorticity contours because of the smoothing property of the inverse laplacian .",
    "therefore , there is a natural separation of length scales : the large scale associated with variation of the streamfunction contours and the fine scale that is needed to resolve the vorticity or potential vorticity .",
    "we take these to be our scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we test this idea experimentally by measuring the independence of subsystems so defined .",
    "we then construct a theory based on this definition of subsystem together with the additivity of quadratic invariants , and compare its predictions with the measured vorticity probability density function .      in a remarkable series of papers @xcite [ reprinted in @xcite ] appears to be the first researcher to apply statistical mechanics ideas to the description of fluid turbulence .",
    "many basic ideas used by later researchers were introduced first by burgers in these rarely cited papers .",
    "burgers introduced both lattice and fourier models and showed that such models satisfy liouville s theorem when viscosity is neglected .",
    "he used a counting argument to derive an entropy expression and obtained a corresponding entropy maximization principle .",
    "he proposed a microscopic scale for describing turbulent motion during short intervals of time and defined macroscopic quantities by counting possible streamfunction realizations for sequences of time intervals .",
    "his analysis is based on the reynolds stress equation , and he obtained a probability distribution that can be used to calculate the mean value of the reynolds stress .    motivated by the work of burgers , @xcite took up the subject and considered a representation of the vorticity field in terms of a set of point vortices , zero - area vortices , of equal strength .",
    "because this results in a finite - dimensional particle - like hamiltonian system , onsager could proceed to apply techniques of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "he gave arguments for the existence of negative temperatures and the occurrence of coherent structures in a confined region , which are often observed in nature .",
    "related ideas have been further pursued by many researchers [ e.g.@xcite ] [ see @xcite for a recent review ] .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the statistical mechanics of point vortices within a mean field approximation , and argued that in the negative temperature regime , large like - signed vortices are the most probable state .",
    "@xcite projected three - dimensional fluid equations ( including mhd ) onto a fourier basis and truncated to obtain a finite - dimensional system .",
    "evidently unaware of the early work of @xcite , he again demonstrated that his truncated system satisfies a version of liouville s theorem and was thus amenable to techniques of statistical mechanics .",
    "later , kraichnan considered two - dimensional fluids [ @xcite ] and noted that out of the infinite number of invariants , two quadratic invariants , the so - called rugged invariants , remained invariants after truncation .",
    "kraichnan and montgomery argued that these rugged invariants are the important ones , and obtained an equilibrium state , which is related to that obtained by minimum enstrophy arguments put forth by selective decay hypotheses [ @xcite ] .",
    "also , using kolmogorov - like dimensional arguments and the rugged invariants , kraichnan argued for the existence of direct and inverse cascades for two - dimensional turbulence [ @xcite ] .",
    "the two - dimensional euler equation , like the vlasov and other transport equations , can be viewed as mean field theory .",
    "such equations are known to generate fine structure in the course of evolution .",
    "this led @xcite to consider a coarse graining procedure coupled with the idea of preserving all of the infinity of invariants such theories possess .",
    "he applied his ideas in the context of stellar dynamics , but the ideas are akin to those used in treatments of the classical electron gas by generalizations of debye - hckle theory [ e.g.  @xcite ] . later , such ideas were used in the fluid context by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and again in the stellar dynamics context by @xcite .",
    "our development to a large degree parallels that of these authors . in these works a microscopic probability distribution represents a local description of the small - scale fluctuations of microscopic vortices .",
    "the streamfunction is assumed to be uniform on the microscopic scale , and an equilibrium state is obtained by maximizing the boltzmann entropy of microstates , an entropy that is obtained by a counting argument first given by lynden - bell .",
    "this produces a most probable state .",
    "more recently , the necessity of incorporating the infinite number of invariants in statistical mechanics theories has been brought into question , and theories based on finite - dimensional models with fewer constraints have been developed . @xcite",
    "have argued that including an infinite number of invariants provides no additional statistical information , and @xcite has argued that previous theories have not properly handled the neglected small scale phenomena , and he has proposed a theory that uses inequality constraints associated with only the convex invariants .",
    "our approach is perhaps most closely aligned to these works , but is distinguished by the fact that the invariants chosen are explicitly based on the additivity argument , the choice of subsystems , and experimental observation .",
    "natural phenomena in atmospheres and oceans have served as a motivation for the application of statistical mechanics to two - dimensional fluid flow [ e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "examples include zonal flows in planets , such as the jet stream and the polar night jet , and organized coherent vortices , such as the great red spot of jupiter [ @xcite ] .",
    "attempts have been made to explain such naturally occuring phenomena in terms of the coherent structures found to emerge in quasi - geostrophic and two - dimensional turbulence after long time evolution . with external small - scale",
    "forcing a few long - lived and large structures resulting from nonlinear merging processes are seen to be stable self - organized states that persist in a strongly turbulent environment [ @xcite ] .",
    "these structures have been studied over many years , often because of their relevance to large - scale geophysical and astrophysical flows [ @xcite ] . in statistical mechanics , such steady states with large structures",
    "are envisioned to be the most probable state arising from some extremization principle .",
    "various extremization principles [ e.g.@xcite ] have been proposed with selected global invariants of the system used as constraints .",
    "observations of turbulent flow with large coherent structures in a rotating annulus [ @xcite ] have led us to reconsider statistical mechanics in the context of rapidly rotating systems .      by necessity",
    "this paper contains much notation . to aid the reader we give a brief summary here . as noted above , statistical mechanics deals with two scales : the microscopic scale @xmath1 , characteristic of microscopic @xmath2-cells , and the macroscopic scale @xmath0 , characteristic of macroscopic @xmath3-cells .",
    "several averages are considered .",
    "the symbol @xmath4 denotes an average with probability density @xmath5 , where choices for the subscript @xmath6 will be used to delineate between different cases .",
    "the appropriate volume measure will be clear from context but is also revealed by the argument of @xmath5 .",
    "averages with uniform density are denoted by @xmath7 , where the subscript denotes the integration variable .",
    "an exception is the time average , which we denote by an overbar .",
    "thus , the time average of a function is denoted by @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the limits of integration for this kind of average will either be stated or will be clear from context .",
    "we denote the potential vorticity field by @xmath10 , by which we always mean a function . for the potential vorticity distribution on a @xmath3-cell ( subsystem ) we use @xmath11 , an independent variable .",
    "another source of possible confusion is that the symbol @xmath12 is used for the energy lagrange multiplier , as is conventional in statistical mechanics , while the beta - effect of geophysical fluid dynamics is embodied here in the symbol @xmath13 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experiment is described in  [ sec : experiment ] and equations that govern the dominant physics are reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] . in ",
    "[ sec : sm ] we describe some basic ideas about statistical mechanics , as needed for the application to the fluid system of interest . in ",
    "[ sec : mf ] we describe statistical mechanics in the mean field approximation and compare predictions with experiments .",
    "here we show that predictions of the theory are in accordance with experiments . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we conclude .",
    "+     the experiments are conducted in a rotating annulus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ) .",
    "the annulus has an inner radius @xmath14 , outer radius @xmath15 , a sloping bottom , and a flat transparent lid .",
    "the bottom depth varies from @xmath16 at the inner radius to @xmath17 at the outer radius , giving a bottom slope of @xmath18 . for the data analyzed in this paper ,",
    "the rotation frequency of the annulus is @xmath19 hz . an azimuthal jet is generated in the annulus by pumping water in a closed circuit through two concentric rings of holes at the bottom .",
    "fluid is pumped into the annulus through an inner ring at @xmath20 and extracted through an outer ring at @xmath21 ; both rings have 120 circular holes .",
    "each hole has a diameter of @xmath22 , and the total pumping rate is 150 @xmath23 .",
    "the action of the coriolis force on the outward flux generates a counter - rotating azimuthal jet .",
    "a counter - rotating flow is generally more unstable than a co - rotating flow [ @xcite ] .",
    "the water is seeded with neutrally buoyant particles ( polystyrene spheres , diameter @xmath24 ) .",
    "light emitting diodes produce a @xmath25 thick horizontal sheet of light that illuminates the annulus at mid - depth .",
    "the particles suspended in the water are imaged with a camera located @xmath26 above the annulus , and the camera rotates with the tank .",
    "particle image velocimetry ( piv ) is used to obtain the full two - dimensional velocity field [ @xcite ] .",
    "the flow can be characterized by the reynolds , rossby , and ekman numbers",
    ". the maximum velocity @xmath27 cm / s , the length @xmath28 cm ( taken to be the distance between the two forcing rings ) and the kinematic viscosity @xmath29 @xmath30/s yield a reynolds number @xmath31 , indicating that the flow is turbulent . the rossby number ( ratio of inertial to coriolis force ) is @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the rms vorticity ) , which indicates that the coriolis force is dominant , as is the case for planetary flows on large length scales .",
    "finally , the small ekman number , @xmath34 , indicates that dissipation in the bulk is small .",
    "the ekman time , @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the mean fluid height ) for dissipation in the boundary layers is @xmath37 , a time much longer than the typical vortex turnover time , @xmath38 .",
    "the dimensionless numbers indicate that the flow is quasi - geostrophic ; previous studies of turbulence in the annulus have indeed confirmed the strong two - dimensionality of the flow [ @xcite ] .",
    "the barotropic assumption is widely used to describe the flow inside the tank . the equation of motion for a barotropic fluid with topography",
    "is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the potential vorticity , @xmath36 is the tank depth , @xmath41 is the streamfunction , @xmath42 , @xmath43 denotes dissipation , such as that due to molecular viscosity , @xmath44 , or ekman drag , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 denotes a vorticity source due to the pumping",
    ". often the potential vorticity is approximated by @xmath47 where @xmath13 accounts for the beta - effect and is here a linear function of radius , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bottom slope . over the years strong evidence",
    "has accumulted that ( [ eqmn ] ) describes the dominant features of the experiment [ @xcite ] .    for inviscid flow with zero rossby number , there is no vertical variation in the velocity [ @xcite ] , and there is evidence that to leading order the drag and forcing terms cancel .",
    "we are primarily interested in the statistics of motions that occur on the vortex turnover time , and these are governed by the inviscid equation , @xmath50 which is a hamiltonian theory .",
    "a manifestation of the hamiltonian nature of two - dimensional euler - like flows such as ( [ eq : euler ] ) is the finite - dimensional hamiltonian description of point vortices provided by @xcite , which played an essential motivating role in onsager s theory [ e.g.  @xcite ] . for a distributed vorticity variable such as @xmath51",

    "this hamiltonian formulation of the two - dimensional euler equation appeared in @xcite , based on the identical structure for the vlasov - poisson system [ @xcite ] , and in @xcite .",

    "the infinite family of casimir invariants @xmath59=\\int { \\cal c}(q ) dxdy$ ] , where @xmath60 is arbitrary , satisfies @xmath61 for all functionals @xmath46 , and is thus conserved by ( [ eq : euler ] ) .",
    "the presence of these invariants is one way that the statistical mechanics of fluids differs from that of particle systems .",
    "as noted in  [ sec : intro ] , many attempts have been made to apply statistical mechanics to fluids and other infinite - dimensional systems . in this section",
    "we introduce our notation and discuss some basic ideas .      in classical statistical mechanics",
    "the microscopic dynamics is governed by hamilton s equations and the phase space is the @xmath62-dimensional manifold with canonical coordinates @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the configuration coordinate and @xmath66 is the corresponding canonical momentum .",
    "typically @xmath67 , the number of degrees of freedom , is a very large number @xmath68 .",
    "we call this @xmath62-dimensional phase space @xmath69 , a standard notation introduced by p.  and t.  ehrenfest [ @xcite ] .",
    "our fluid is assumed to be governed by ( [ eq : euler ] ) , an infinite - dimensional hamiltonian theory , and thus the instantaneous state of our system is determined by the vorticity - like variable @xmath70 , which we suppose is contained in some space of functions @xmath71 .",
    "the index @xmath72 for coordinates of @xmath69 is analogous to the eulerian position @xmath73 , a point in the physical domain occupied by the fluid , which is viewed as an index for @xmath71 .    in conventional statistical mechanics ,",
    "the microscopic dynamics is finite dimensional , and one attempts to explain phenomena on the macroscopic level by considering the thermodynamic limit in which @xmath74 .",
    "however , for a fluid , the dynamics is already infinite dimensional , and thus as noted in  [ sec : intro ] , to apply statistical mechanics researchers have introduced various finite - dimensional discretizations .",
    "onsager s description of the continuum vortex dynamics in terms of a collection of point vortices amounts to the specification of the coordinates of the manifold analogous to @xmath69 as the spatial positions of the point vortices , @xmath75 .",
    "alternatively , lee s representation of a three - dimensional fluid in terms of a truncated fourier series has the fourier amplitudes being coordinates of a space analogous to @xmath69 .",
    "this procedure was carried over to two dimensions by kraichnan and montgomery [ @xcite ] . for our potential vorticity variable",
    "the fourier amplitudes are given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "another alternative is to replace the continuum vorticity by a lattice model [ e.g.  @xcite ] , i.e. , an expansion in terms of tent functions or finite elements of scale size @xmath1 . in the present context",
    "the vorticity is replaced by its values on the lattice , @xmath78 , where the kernel @xmath79 is typically chosen to represent a square lattice with a finite number @xmath67 of sites located at @xmath80 . in general @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the number of lattice points in the @xmath84 and @xmath85 directions , respectively .",
    "we will refer to this discretization as a division into @xmath2-cells .    given",
    "a finite - dimensional system one can make various assumptions , e.g. , the probabilistic assumptions of ` molecular chaos ' , but this requires a notion of phase space volume conservation .      in classical statistical mechanics",
    "one calculates averages over the manifold @xmath69 , and the natural volume element is given by @xmath86 .",
    "however , for @xmath71 the situation is not so straightforward , and so we explore candidates for the analogous volume element .",
    "the calculation of averages in a statistical theory requires a phase space measure , @xmath87 , which is a sort of volume element for @xmath71 .",
    "the volume element can be interpreted as a probability measure defined on functions that take values between @xmath51 and @xmath88 .",
    "averages calculated using the probability measure are functional integrals akin to those used in feynman s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and in field theory [ e.g.@xcite ] .",
    "the various discretizations introduced above have been employed to give meaning to functional integrals , but the fourier and lattice models are most common .    for the fourier discretization , kraichnan and montgomery used the volume element @xmath89 , where the product is truncated at some maximum wave number .",
    "alternatively , the volume element for lattice models is written as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a volume element associated with the potential vorticity varying from @xmath51 to @xmath92 in a lattice partition ( @xmath93 ) , and @xmath81 is , as above , the number of lattice sites , which have a scale @xmath1 . here , a total volume element @xmath87 is a product of volume elements of each lattice site @xmath91 . in the case of a finite small lattice",
    ", @xmath91 becomes a one - dimensional volume , i.e. , @xmath94 at the lattice point @xmath80 of the physical two - dimensional space . in order for a notion of measure based on phase space volume to be useful ,",
    "the volume must be preserved in the course of time .",
    "preservation of phase space volume is assured by liouville s theorem , an important theorem of mechanics .",
    "as noted above , burgers and lee showed that a version of liouville s theorem applies to the system governing the fourier amplitudes for the inviscid fluid .",
    "for vorticity dynamics the amplitudes satisfy @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the fourier transformation of the beta effect and @xmath97 is completely antisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , antisymmetry directly implies liouville s theorem , @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , we have shown directly that the lattice model possesses a version of liouville s theorem , which we recently discovered was anticipated in @xcite .",
    "this result was also inferred in @xcite .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the lattice model discretization can be viewed as an expansion of the vorticity in terms of a tent function basis [ e.g.@xcite ] . upon multiplying the equation of motion by a basis function , as is typical with galerkin projection , and representing all derivatives as differences , eq .",
    "( [ eq : euler ] ) becomes @xmath101 which is an equation for the potential vorticity at the lattice point @xmath102 .",
    "assuming a periodic lattice , the quantity @xmath103 is easily seen to be completely antisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , just as was the case for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , liouville s theorem follows , @xmath107 where each term of the last sum vanishes . here",
    "the matrix @xmath3 represents the inverse laplacian and @xmath108 is another matrix that has the same antisymmetry property as @xmath109 .",
    "having defined phase space and verified liouville s theorem , we are poised to write a partition function and to define phase space averages .",
    "the natural expression for the partition function associated with the canonical ( gibbs ) ensemble is @xmath110 - c[q ] } \\,{\\cal d}q\\ , , \\label{zc}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the hamiltonian of  [ sec : dynamics ] and @xmath112 denotes the infinite family of casimir invariants .",

    "consequently , a mean field approach has been taken , which we turn to in  [ sec : mf ] .",
    "an alternative to the direct evalution of ( [ < > c ] ) is to appeal to the fact that the dynamics of ( [ eq : euler ] ) is an area - preserving _ rearrangement _ [ e.g.  @xcite ] .",

    "it is well - known that vorticity equations like ( [ eq : euler ] ) , the vlasov equation , and other transport equations develop fine structure in the course of time . because of this @xcite proposed a coarse graining procedure to obtain a most probable state .",
    "he divided phase space up into hyper - fine cells that are assumed to be capable of resolving the fine structure .",
    "these are the @xmath2-cells referred to in   [ ssec : state ] , which have a scale size @xmath1 .",
    "experimentally @xmath1 is determined by the resolution , but in ideal theory the fine structure can become arbitrarily fine and so a limiting procedure is required .",
    "in addition @xcite proposed larger cells , which we have called @xmath3-cells , that characterize a macroscopic scale @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3-cells contain many @xmath2-cells that can be freely exchanged within an @xmath3-cell without changing any macroscopic quantity .",
    "thus one is able to count states and obtain an expression for a coarse grained or mean field entropy that can be maximized subject to constraints .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite reconstructed and improved this formulation .",
    "miller defined @xmath2-cells and @xmath3-cells based on scales with the property that the energy averaged over @xmath3-cells approximates the energy averaged over @xmath2-cells .",
    "however , we argue that the most important condition for separating the @xmath3-cell and @xmath2-cell scale lengths is _ statistical independence _ , which assures near independence of the probability densities of @xmath3-cells , which are viewed as subsystems , and is associated with near additivity of the constraints .",
    "these are crucial properties .",
    "experimentally the two scales can be demonstrated as in fig .",

    "s application to the two - dimensional continuum euler model , he assumes that all @xmath2-cells are occupied by a vortex and these vortices are indistinguishable if they have the same value of vorticity . because there are no empty @xmath2-cells , @xmath136 and because the @xmath2-cells are indistinguishable",

    "the reason for this is that additive invariants give rise to statistical independence of subsystems . in our treatment of fluids ,",
    "subsystems are @xmath3-cells and so we consider invariants that are additive over these regions . there is a close connection between ruggedness of invariants and the property of additivty . we show that only the rugged invariants are additive , and thus they characterize the statistical properties of @xmath3-cells . in   [ ssec : sub ] and   [ ssec : pdf ] we will see that experimental results support this reasoning .",
    "@xcite fourier transformed and truncated to obtain a finite - dimensional system .",
    "they argued that the truncated remnants of the total vorticity , enstrophy , and energy are the only invariants to be used in a statistical mechanics treatment because these invariants are rugged , i.e. , they remain invariants of the truncated system .",
    "they also appear to be aware that these invariants possess the property of additivity , but they do not emphasize this point .",
    "although @xcite has argued that this kind of truncation does not properly handle small scale behavior , we find that this theory does a fairly good job at predicting the energy spectrum , but we will report on this elsewhere .",

    "( this is the idea behind spectral reduction [ @xcite ] , a computational method where groupings of fourier modes ( bins ) are described by a single representative . ) for the quadratic casimir invariant , the enstrophy , we have @xmath181 . similarly , the energy can be written as a sum over @xmath3-cell energies , @xmath182 .",
    "the linear casimir invariant @xmath183 merely reduces to the zeroth fourier coefficient , and is thus in a trivial sense additive .",
    "higher order invariants , @xmath184 for @xmath185 , have fourier representations that are not reducible to expressions in terms of a single sum over @xmath3-cells .",
    "the discretized lattice model has properties similar to those described above .",
    "the quadratic casimir invariant and energy reduce to sums over a finite number of @xmath2-cell lattice variables , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which are potential vorticity , height , and streamfunction represented in terms of the kernel function @xmath79 of   [ sec : sm ] as follows : @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are symmetric commuting matrices .",
    "these invariants are rugged , i.e , they are conserved by the finite dynamical system obtained by projection onto the lattice . in addition , because @xmath192 and @xmath193 commute , one can always find an orthogonal matrix @xmath194 that satisfies @xmath195 and @xmath196 , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are diagonal matrices .",

    "this coordinate transformation simultaneously diagonalizes the quadratic casimir invariant and the energy .",
    "however , higher - order casimir invariants are in general not rugged and are in general not simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "thus , higher order invariants are not additive , which means @xmath3-cells share contributions from these invariants . in this sense ,",
    "invariants of order higher than quadratic are not useful for describing the statistics of @xmath3-cells , which by assumption are independent .",
    "now we turn to the question of how to find subsystems , i.e , how to a find a good definition of the @xmath3-cells .",
    "first we note that flows inside the rotating tank with the sloped bottom have azimuthal undulations in most physical quantities ( streamfunction , potential vorticity , etc . ) , and these undulations have been identified as rossby waves [ @xcite ] . in a co - rotating frame , these waves propagate in the rotation direction at constant velocity .",
    "thus , by shifting to a frame moving at the phase velocity of the rossby wave , we obtain a pattern that is statistically stationary on large scales .",
    "for example , the wavy patterns corresponding to the time - averaged streamfunction and potential vorticity are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : jfm_average ] . as noted",
    "before , the streamfunction is fairly smooth , characteristic of the scale @xmath0 , is monotonically decreasing in the radial direction , and describes a strong zonal flow .",
    "however , the time - averaged potential vorticity is scattered with fine structure in space , the @xmath1 scale , but still has a wavy mean pattern similar to that of the time - averaged streamfunction .",
    "so , this suggests that the first step toward defining @xmath3-cells is to consider a frame moving at the phase velocity of the rossby wave .",
    "having determined the frame , we seek @xmath3-cells that are statistically independent . because strong correlation in a preferential direction might affect the geometry of @xmath3-cells and associated additive invariants , we have measured the correlation function , @xmath204 where @xmath205 are the usual polar coordinates . from a large data set of piv measurements we obtain the time average of the velocity field , whence we calculate the potential vorticity at different positions .",
    "then the integrals of ( [ cor ] ) are performed with the spatial limits being the bulk of the area occupied by the fluid with a resolution of @xmath206 and the time limit taken to be 80 revolutions with 47 measurements .",
    "the result of this procedure is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : jfm_corr ] , which shows contours of @xmath207 plotted on a @xmath208 plane .",
    "the highly anisotropic nature of the contours suggests there is significantly less correlation in the radial direction than in the azimuthal direction .",
    "thus to achieve consistent independence the shape of an @xmath3-cell should be elongated .     illustrating the anisotropic nature of the potential vorticity field , which has longer range correlation in the azimuathal direction than in the radial direction ( cf .",
    "[ fig : jfm_average ] ) . ]",
    "in the course of tracking blobs of fluid we generally observe that to good approximation such blobs follow contours of the time - averaged streamfunction .",
    "this , together with the the @xmath207 plot , suggests that a good coordinate for dividing the system into subsystems is the time - averaged streamfunction , @xmath209 contours of @xmath210 tend to be smooth and , we argue , are part of a natural coordinate system for describing turbulence with a mean flow that has slow spatial dependence .",
    "( we have also considered @xmath211 but found it to be not as good because of its greater variability . ) to complete the coordinate system , we introduce a coordinate @xmath212 , which is conjugate to @xmath213 and therefore satisfies @xmath214 thus the coordinate transformation @xmath215 satisfies @xmath216 .",
    "we propose that contours of @xmath210 define @xmath3-cells , which we take to be of small ( infinitesimal ) width in this coordinate , and we propose that the @xmath212 coordinate at fixed @xmath217 represents a continuum of @xmath2-cells .",
    "we imagine an @xmath3-cell to be a region ( nearly a curve ) at fixed @xmath217 .",
    "hence with this definition , the probability density @xmath218 , depends only on the potential vorticity variable @xmath11 and on the coordinate @xmath217 ; i.e. , @xmath219 is the probability of finding a potential vorticity value @xmath11 in the @xmath210 @xmath3-cell .",
    "thus the ensemble average of an arbitrary function @xmath220 is written as @xmath221 where @xmath218 is normalized as @xmath222 . in practice",
    "we can determine the probability @xmath218 from data by the relative frequency definition ( cf .",
    "  [ ssec : pdf ] ) , and then proceed to calculate ( [ podot ] ) .",
    "however , this is equivalent to averaging over @xmath212 and @xmath118 ; e.g.  @xmath223 , where @xmath224 . given @xmath225 and using ( [ mpois ] ) to define @xmath226",
    "we similarly have the equivalence @xmath227 , where the second equality follows by definition .",
    "the undular streamfunction of fig .",
    "[ fig : jfm_average ] mainly represents rossby waves .",

    "[ fig : stat_gauss](b ) can be attributed to experimental resolution and sample size .",
    "we analyzed this by considering the scaling of the skewness and kurtosis with respect to the number of data points @xmath67 and the experimental subsystem width @xmath245 .",

    "we find that the tails decrease as we increase @xmath67 .",
    "a similar examination of the skewness reveals randomness about the value zero .",

    "( [ eq : stat_linear ] ) .    therefore , our theoretical predictions based on a mean field approximation are in good accord with pdfs on @xmath3-cells and the averaged values of potential vorticity and streamfunction from experiments .",
    "our theory also indicates that equilibrium can be locally achieved in @xmath3-cells , even though the system as a whole is turbulent and non - gaussian .",
    "in this paper we have emphasized the relationship between additive invariants and statistical independence : probability densities that result from entropy maximization principles , such as that of   [ ssec : meancd ] , will decompose into a product over subsystems if the entropy is logarithmic ( extensive ) and the invariants included as constraints are additive over subsystems ( m - cells ) .",
    "we have also emphasized that additivity and , consequently , independence depend on the definition of subsystem .",
    "this idea appears , at least implicitly , in conventional statistical mechanics . for example , in the classical calculation of the specific heat of a solid , where one considers a solid to be a collection of lattice sites with spring - like nearest neighbor interactions , the hamiltonian achieves the form of a sum over simple harmonic oscillators .",
    "however , such a diagonal form requires the use of normal coordinates , and only then is the partition function equal to a product over those of the individual oscillators .",
    "thus the notions of subsystem ( here a single oscillator ) , additivity , and statistical independence are intimately related .    in our application of statistical mechanics to inhomogeneous damped and driven turbulence , we have discovered experimentally that a good definition of subsystem is provided by the temporal mean of the streamfunction . with this definition ,",
    "the quadratic invariants ( energy and enstrophy ) are additive , and the concomitant probability density of ( [ eq : jfm_p_odot ] ) agrees quite well with experimental results for both the distribution of vorticity , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : stat_gauss ] ( a ) and ( b ) , and the mean state , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : linear ] .    an alternative interpretation of our results can be obtained by the counting argument of   [ ssec : counting ] . our definition of subsystem amounts to the idea that potential vortices on the same contour of time - averaged streamfunction can exchange their positions with little change in the energy and enstrophy .",
    "however , the relocation of two potential vortices that are on different contours of the streamfunction should result in a large change of the invariants . in this sense",
    ", the number of possible configurations in phase space can be counted , and the maximization of the entropy so obtained gives our result .",
    "our discussion of statistical independence and additivity has been heuristic , in the spirit of boltzmann and gibbs .",
    "we suggest that a more rigorous development could use the techniques described in other works [ e.g.  @xcite ] adapted to our @xmath217 coordinate that describes our subsystems .",
    "for example , one could begin with an appropriate sequence of lattice models and obtain a continuum limit .",
    "although in this paper we have focused on a geostrophic fluid , our procedure is of general utility and is applicable to physical systems governed by a variety of transport equations .",
    "the unifying formalism is the noncanonical hamiltonian description of  [ sec : dynamics ] , which plays the unifying role played by finite - dimensional canonical hamiltonian systems in conventional statistical mechanics .",

    "<S> while the statistical mechanics approach used was motivated by and applied to experiments on turbulence in a rotating annulus , the approach is quite general and is applicable to a large class of hamiltonian systems , including drift - wave plasma models , vlasov - poisson dynamics , and kinetic theories of stellar dynamics . </S>"
