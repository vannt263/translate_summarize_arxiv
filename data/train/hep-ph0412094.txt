    "the _ cannonball _ ( cb ) model is a unified model of high - energy astrophysics , in which the gamma background radiation , cluster  cooling flows \" , gamma - ray bursts , x - ray flashes and cosmic - ray electrons and nuclei of all energies share a common origin .",
    "the mechanism underlying all these phenomena is the emission of relativistic  cannonballs \" by ordinary supernovae , analogous to the observed ejection of plasmoids by quasars and microquasars .",
    "it is not unusual in talks to start with the credits , as in a film .",
    "many of the ideas i shall exploit have a long pedigree : gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the main ( injection ) process for cosmic rays @xcite ( crs ) ; grbs are the main cr ( production and acceleration ) mechanism @xcite , and are induced by narrow jets emitted by accreting compact stellar objects @xcite ; their @xmath0-rays being low - energy photons boosted to higher energies by inverse compton scattering @xcite ( ics ) .",
    "the concrete realization of these ideas in the  cannonball \" ( cb ) model is more recent and covers grbs @xcite , x - ray flashes @xcite ( xrfs ) , their respective afterglows @xcite , the gamma  background \" radiation @xcite , the cr luminosity of our galaxy @xcite , the  cooling flows \" of galaxy clusters @xcite , and the properties of crs @xcite .",
    "a look at the sky , or a more modest one at the web , results in the realization that jets are emitted by many astrophysical systems ( stars , quasars , microquasars ... ) .",
    "one impressive case @xcite is that of the quasar pictor a , shown in fig .",
    "[ pictor ] .",
    "_ somehow _ , the active galactic nucleus of this object is discontinuously spitting _ something _ that does not appear to expand sideways before it stops and blows up , having by then travelled for a distance of several times the visible radius of a galaxy .",
    "many such systems have been observed .",
    "they are very relativistic : the lorentz factors ( lfs ) @xmath1 of their ejecta are typically of @xmath2 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for these mighty ejections suspected to be due to episodes of violent accretion into a very massive black hole is not understood .    in our galaxy",
    "there are `` micro - quasars '' , in which the central black hole has only a few times the mass of the sun .",
    "the first example @xcite was the @xmath0-ray source grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "aperiodically , about once a month , it emits two opposite _ cannonballs _ , travelling at @xmath3 .",
    "as the event takes place , the x - ray emission attributed to an unstable accretion disk temporarily decreases .",
    "how part of the accreating material ends up ejected along the system s axis is not understood .",
    "the process reminds one of the blobs emitted upwards as the water closes into the `` hole '' made by a stone dropped onto its surface . for quasars and @xmath4-quasars , it is only the relativistic , general - relativistic magneto - hydro - dynamic details that remain to be filled in ! atomic lines from many elements",
    "have been observed @xcite in the cbs of @xmath4-quasar ss 433 .",
    "thus , at least in this case , the ejecta are made of ordinary matter , and not of some fancier substance such as @xmath5 pairs .",

    "an accretion torus is hypothesized to be produced around the newly - born compact object , either by stellar material originally close to the surface of the imploding core and left behind by the explosion - generating outgoing shock , or by more distant stellar matter falling back after its passage @xcite .",
    "a cb is emitted , as observed in microquasars @xcite , when part of the accretion disk falls abruptly onto the compact object , see fig .",

    "_ do supernovae emit cannonballs ? _ up to last year , there was only one case in which the data was good enough to tell : sn1987a , the core - collapse sn in the lmc , whose neutrino emission was detected .",
    "speckle interferometry measurements made 30 and 38 days after the explosion @xcite did show two relativistic cbs ( one of them `` superluminal '' ) , emitted in opposite directions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figcostas ] .",
    "a freshly jetted cb is assumed to be expanding at a speed comparable to that of sound in a relativistic plasma ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "its typical baryon number is that of half of mercury , @xmath8 , its start - up lf is @xmath9 ( both ascertained from the properties of afterglows ( ags ) , and of the grb s @xmath0 rays ) . in their voyage , cbs intercept the electrons and nuclei of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , previously ionized by the grb s @xmath0 rays . in seconds of ( highly doppler - foreshortened )",
    "observer s time , such an expanding cb becomes `` collisionless '' , that is , its radius becomes bigger than a typical nucleus - nucleus interaction length .",

    "if the nuclei entering a cb are magnetically `` scrambled '' and are reemitted isotropically in the cb s rest system , a radial loss of momentum results .",
    "the rate of such a loss corresponds to an inwards radial force on the cb . in our analysis of grb ags",
    ", we assumed that this force counteracts the expansion , and that when the radius stabilizes , the inwards pressure is in equilibrium with the pressure of the cb s magnetic field .",

    "[ pictor ] the two jets of pictor a are shown , with contour plots corresponding to radio - intensity levels @xcite .",
    "we interpret this radio signal as the synchrotron radiation of the cb - generated _ cosmic - ray electrons _ in the ambient magnetic fields .",
    "the cbs of pictor a must also be scattering the intercepted nuclei , and converting them into _ cosmic - ray nuclei_.    the range of a cb is governed by the rate at which it loses momentum by encountering ism particles and catapulting them into crs .",
    "the initial lf , @xmath9 , is typically halved in a fraction of a kpc , while a cb becomes non - relativistic only at distances of 10 s or even 100 s of kpc , well into a galaxy s halo or beyond .",
    "the crs of the cb model are deposited along the long _ line _ of flight of cbs , in contradistinction with those of the standard models , in which the crs are generated by sn shocks , at the _",

    "the proposed candidate sources range from the rather conventional ( e.g.  active galaxies @xcite ) to the decisively speculative ( e.g.  primordial black hole evaporation @xcite ) .",
    "a `` cosmological '' origin is the most noble putative ancestry , but though the gbr index @xmath20 is uncannily direction - independent , the egret gbr flux in directions above the galactic disk and centre shows significant anisotropies , correlated with our position relative to the centre of the galaxy @xcite . how does the gbr relate to crs ?    below a few gev , the local spectrum of crs is affected by the solar wind and the earth s magnetic field , its modelling is elaborate . above @xmath21 gev , the spectrum of cr electrons , shown in fig .",

    "this means that the * source * spectra of ( relativistic ) nuclei and electrons have the same energy dependence : @xmath28 , with a species - independent @xmath29 .",

    "the observed non - uniform ( i.e.  non - cosmological ) distribution of grb flux in intensity , latitude and longitude is well reproduced @xcite for an ellipsoidal cr halo of within very large errors characteristic height @xmath38 kpc , and radius @xmath39 kpc .",
    "if the crs are chiefly galactic in origin , their accelerators must compensate for the escape of crs from the galaxy to sustain the observed cr intensity : it is known from meteorite records that the cr flux has been fairly steady for the past few giga - years @xcite .",
    "the conventional estimate of the cr luminosity of the milky way is @xcite : @xmath40    in the cb model @xmath41 can be estimated from the electron cr density involved in its successful description of the gbr , if the local observed ratio of proton to electron fluxes is representative of the galactic average .",
    "it can also be estimated from the rate of galactic sne and the typical energy in their jets of cbs .",
    "the results of these estimates agree @xcite , but they are over one order of magnitude larger than eq .",

    "this is not a contradiction , for the cb - model effective volume of confined crs is much bigger than in the standard picture , wherein crs are confined to the galactic disk .",
    "the cb - model value of the cr confinement time is also one order of magnitude larger than the standard result , based on the ratios of stable to unstable isotopes @xcite .",
    "this alterity is understood @xcite : the stable crs spend much of their time in the galaxy s halo , which in the cb - model is magnetized by the flux of crs that the cbs deposit in it .",
    "it is customary to `` renormalize '' the energy calibration of different experiments to make flux measurements look in better agreement ; and to present the data as the flux times a power of energy , to emphasize the `` features '' of the spectrum and its changes of power `` index '' .",

    "that would be good news for cosmology , even if grb - associated type ia sne deviate from the usual `` standard candle '' properties : in the cb model sne are roughly axially but not spherically symmetric . sn1998bw and the other almost identical sne associated with grbs ( some spectroscopically established ) , are ordinary sne seen very close to their axis .",
    "both type ia and core - collapse sne ( at least of type ib , c ) ought to be closer to standard `` torch - lights '' than to `` candles '' .",
    "we have also seen that the cb - model explains the shape of the cr electron spectrum , and the related spectrum and angular distribution of the gbr , most of which is not `` cosmological '' : it is associated at high latitudes with our own galactic halo .",
    "higher - energy data on cr electrons and the gbr might confirm the model by discovering the predicted `` knees '' in the corresponding spectra @xcite .",
    "seeing the `` gbr '' light from the halo of andromeda would also be quite a coup @xcite .",
    "the cb model of crs is rather successful , considering that only one parameter was adjusted .",
    "clearly the results could be improved , as better data are gathered ( e.g. on composition at all energies above @xmath114 tev ) .",
    "many simplifying choices were made : a spatially constant ism composition , a 50 - 50 contribution of nuclei accelerated and unaccelerated within a cb , a nave energy dependence of the galactic - confinement factor ... even so , the distribution of crs in the galaxy , their total luminosity , the broken power - law spectra with their observed slopes , the position of the knee(s ) and ankle(s ) , and the alleged variations of composition with energy are all explained in terms of simple physics .",
    "surely , `` life '' may be more complicated , e.g.  nearby sne could contribute low - energy crs , accelerated by conventional shock mechanisms .",
    "there is no cb - model - specific prediction concerning crs , except that they are deposited along very long lines exiting star - death regions , as opposed to points in these regions , as in standard models",
    ". this prediction might be testable in the search for line inhomogeneities in the radiation from cr electrons .",
    "the cb model is not a _ theory _ of practically all high - energy astrophysical phenomena .",
    "it is lacking a deeper theoretical understanding of the magneto - dynamics within a cb ; and of _ cannons _ themselves : the engines generating the mighty ejections of compact astrophysical objects .",
