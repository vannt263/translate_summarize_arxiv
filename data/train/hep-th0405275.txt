    "the homogeneous sine - gordon ( hsg ) models  @xcite are two - dimensional quantum field theories with a number of remarkable properties .",
    "they are integrable perturbations of level-@xmath5 @xmath6-parafermions  @xcite , that is of coset conformal field theories of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is a simple compact lie group with lie algebra @xmath8 , @xmath9 is an integer , and @xmath10 is the rank of @xmath8 . in the limit",
    "@xmath11 they can be analysed using semiclassical techniques , and the resulting data used to make conjectures for the mass spectra and exact s - matrices at arbitrary values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "checks of the s - matrices using both thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba )  @xcite and form - factor  @xcite approaches leave little doubt that they describe the perturbed parafermionic theories correctly , even for small values of @xmath5 far from the semiclassical regime .",
    "an interesting feature to emerge from the semiclassical studies was the presence of unstable particles  @xcite .",
    "if  @xmath12 is the coxeter number of  @xmath8 , a total of @xmath13 particle - like states ( in the simply - laced cases ) were identified , @xmath14 for each positive root of @xmath8 .",
    "those corresponding to the simple roots are stable ; all the rest are semiclassically unstable . on the other hand , in the s - matrix treatment of the full quantum theory ,",
    "only stable particles are seen directly .",
    "evidence for the unstable particles must come by more indirect routes , such as the appearance of resonance poles at complex rapidities in the scattering amplitudes of pairs of stable asymptotic particle states .",
    "however , for the hsg models only the @xmath15 sets of unstable particles associated with the roots of height two can be picked up in this way . and at small values of @xmath5 ,",
    "far from the semiclassical regime , the resonance peaks for the height - two particles are very broad , and their interpretation becomes delicate .",
    "this raises an immediate question  how should we verify the existence of the remaining particles in the quantum theory , and what influence do they have on the physical properties of the models ?",
    "are the extra unstable particles even present in the models with @xmath5 small , or do they merely emerge when the limit @xmath11 is taken ?    in this paper we shall address these and related issues by returning to the study of finite - size effects using the tba technique . at mass scales where new stable or unstable particle states become important , we predict analytically ( and confirm numerically ) a change in the behaviour of the finite - size scaling function , even for those unstable particles which are not seen directly in the two - particle s - matrices .",
    "the influence of the extra unstable particles gives the hsg models a much richer structure of renormalisation group flows than was initially thought , unifying and generalising the simplest flows between conformal field theories within a common structure .",
    "moreover , as a result of parity breaking , some of these flows turn out to involve heterotic coset models .",
    "our main observations were first presented in @xcite , and @xcite can be consulted for further background material .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "some key features of the hsg models and their resonances are recalled , and our strategy for detecting the unstable resonances is described .",
    "this requires us to be able to separate the relevant mass scales suitably , and section  3 is devoted to an analysis of this problem in the classical theory .",
    "the idea of ` shielding ' is introduced , and it is shown how certain mass scales one might navely expect to find in a classical hsg model may be missing . then in section  4",
    "we show , through a detailed analysis of the tba equations which we illustrate with a number of examples , that these classical effects are precisely matched in the finite - size behaviour of the quantum theory .",
    "the maximal number of separated steps that a general hsg model can exhibit , a question rendered non - trivial by shielding , is discussed in section  5 .",
    "we then move on to other ways to understand the crossovers , first discussing predictions from the lagrangian approach in section  6 before making some comments on form factor calculations in section  7 .",
    "finally , section  8 contains our conclusions and there are two appendices .",
    "[ partsec ]    throughout this paper , we shall be considering the hsg models corresponding to perturbations of the level-@xmath5 parafermionic coset conformal field theories @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is a simple compact lie group , with lie algebra @xmath8 of rank @xmath10 , coxeter number @xmath12 , and dual coxeter number @xmath16 . since we will only discuss the cases",
    "where @xmath8 is simply - laced , @xmath17 , but we shall preserve the distinction in formulae of more general applicability .    unlike the cases first studied by zamolodchikov  @xcite and others , the hsg models are multiparameter deformations of conformal field theories .",
    "the basic operators of the unperturbed theory lie in multiplets @xmath18 labelled by two representations of @xmath6 with highest weights @xmath19 , and two weights @xmath20 in those representations  @xcite , and the hsg perturbing operators are certain spinless primary fields @xmath21 , with conformal dimensions @xmath22 . since the multiplicity of the weight  @xmath23 in the adjoint representation is @xmath10 , @xmath24 is @xmath25-dimensional , and has a basis @xmath26 .",
    "the perturbations within this multiplet which lead to hsg models are conveniently parametrised by a pair of @xmath10-dimensional vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the components of the vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 . from this perspective",
    "the hsg actions have the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes an action for the conformal field theory of level-@xmath5 @xmath6-parafermions , and @xmath34 is a dimensionful coupling which can be related to the overall mass scale , once the combined normalisation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 has been fixed by demanding the standard short - distance behaviour of two - point functions involving @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath35 is trivially invariant under a joint rescaling @xmath36 which together with the normalisation condition leaves @xmath37 dimensionless parameters in @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus the theory is determined by a total of @xmath38 parameters , one of which can be mapped onto the overall scale .",
    "a more explicit construction of the hsg actions   is provided by the identification of @xmath33 with the gauged wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wzw ) action associated with a coset of the form @xmath39 at level @xmath5 , where @xmath40 is a maximal abelian torus ( see  @xcite and section  [ lagsec ] for details ) .",
    "then , @xmath41 are the cartan matrix elements of the spinless primary field corresponding to the wzw field in the adjoint representation  @xcite .",
    "one of the nicest features of this formulation is that it simplifies the analysis of these models in the large-@xmath5 limit , which corresponds to both the weak - coupling ( perturbative ) and semiclassical regimes of the perturbed gauged wzw action .",
    "the hsg models can also be characterised by their long - distance , infrared , behaviour .",
    "the exact @xmath42-matrices proposed in  @xcite describe the scattering of a set of stable solitonic particles labelled by two quantum numbers , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 labels a simple root of @xmath8 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the mass of the particle @xmath43 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a dimensionful overall mass scale , @xmath48 are @xmath10 arbitrary ( non - vanishing ) relative masses , one for each simple root of @xmath8 , and the numbers @xmath49 are the components of the perron - frobenius eigenvector of the @xmath50 cartan matrix .",
    "the s - matrix elements of these particles depend on a further @xmath51 real ` resonance parameters ' @xmath52 , defined for each pair @xmath53 of neighbouring nodes on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 .",
    "the resonance parameters are most conveniently specified by assigning a variable @xmath54 to each node of @xmath8 and setting @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting set of infrared parameters @xmath47 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is redundant , but the obvious symmetries @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , ensure that there are only @xmath38 independent parameters , just as for the ultraviolet description of the models .",
    "classically , the theory exhibits further solitonic particle - like solutions associated with all of the other positive roots @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "their masses can be specified in a concise way via @xmath62 where the @xmath63 , @xmath64 , are the fundamental weights of @xmath8 and satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "the relative mass scale for the solitonic particles associated with the positive root @xmath66 is then @xmath67 which reduces to @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the semiclassical analysis performed using the gauged wzw formulation in  @xcite shows that the classical particles associated with non - simple roots decay , and so do not appear directly in the spectrum of asymptotic quantum states . in particular , if @xmath70 is a root of @xmath8 or , equivalently , @xmath71 is a pair of neighbouring nodes on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 , the relative mass scale and decay width of the soliton particles associated with that root are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    in the full quantum theory",
    ", such long - lived unstable particles should correspond to _ resonances _ in interactions among the stable particles  @xcite .",
    "for example , if two stable particles scatter at a center - of - mass energy @xmath74 close to the mass of an unstable state with appropriate quantum numbers , then they can form that state and remain in it for a time roughly equal to its lifetime , before decaying .",
    "consequently , the transition amplitude shows a bump at the appropriate energy , which normally corresponds to a complex simple pole in the @xmath42-matrix amplitude .",
    "this pole is located on the second riemann sheet of the complex ( mandelstam ) @xmath75-plane , and its position can be conveniently written as @xmath76 . in this way , @xmath77 measures the lifetime of the unstable particle , and the form of the resonance pole is given by the breit - wigner formula @xmath78 notice that the bump in the scattering probability @xmath79 occurs around @xmath80 , justifying the usual identification of @xmath81 with the physical mass of the unstable particle ( see for example the discussions in  @xcite , especially @xcite ) .",
    "another definition sometimes used for this mass is @xmath82 .",
    "if the lifetime is large , which translates into the condition runs from @xmath83@xmath84 for hadron resonances and the @xmath85 and @xmath86 bosons , to much smaller values for other electroweakly decaying particles , like @xmath87 or @xmath88 for the pions @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively  @xcite . ] @xmath91 and corresponds to the situation when the pole is close to the real ( physical ) axis of the complex @xmath75-plane , then @xmath92 .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath93 is larger , the lifetime is short and the unstable particle does not have a definite physical mass , as a consequence of the uncertainty principle .",
    "this has made the proper definition of the masses of unstable particles a subject of debate , which becomes of phenomenological relevance when the experimental data is accurate enough , as is exemplified by the cases of the @xmath85 boson  @xcite or the baryon resonances  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in particular , there is no general consensus as to how to choose between @xmath94 and @xmath95 to characterise the mass of the unstable state , even though they differ significantly when @xmath96 is large .    in the hsg models",
    "this question can be studied in a context where the s - matrix and related observables are known exactly . even though it was the correspondence between unstable particles and resonance poles in the semiclassical limit that provided the starting - point for the s - matrix elements conjectured in  @xcite , the fact that they are thought to be exact even away from this limit allows non - trivial predictions to be made and tested . for the scattering between particles @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 neighbouring nodes on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 and with @xmath97 initially to the left of @xmath98 , the relevant amplitude @xmath101 has a resonance pole at the complex rapidity value @xmath102 .",
    "this corresponds to a pole on the second sheet of the complex @xmath75-plane at @xmath103 , where @xmath104 this pole can only be associated with a physical unstable particle if @xmath105  @xcite , which requires @xmath106 .",
    "( if @xmath107 , the pole is a ` shadow pole ' whose existence is required by the hermitian anlyticity condition satisfied by the @xmath42-matrix amplitudes  @xcite . ) in the semiclassical limit , @xmath5 is large and the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 corresponding to @xmath110 satisfy the bound @xmath111 .",
    "the consequent smallness of this ratio means that the pole at @xmath110 can be immediately interpreted as a trace of a long - lived unstable particle associated with the height - two root @xmath70 . in this regime",
    "the mass scale of the unstable particle is unambiguously defined by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is given by  .    for small @xmath5 , beyond the semiclassical limit , the interpretation of this pole is not so clear .",
    "it is so far from the physical real axis that the approximation provided by the breit - wigner formula is less useful , as illustrated by figure  [ pole ] .",
    "this is particularly clear for @xmath114 , when the pole is located at @xmath115 .",
    "then , for large enough values of the resonance parameter , namely @xmath116 , the ratio @xmath117 and , not surprisingly , the two standard ways to characterise the mass scale of the would - be unstable state lead to very different values : @xmath118 letting @xmath119 tend to infinity , these two scales can be made arbitrarily far apart .",
    "thus , even the unstable particles whose resonance poles can in principle be seen in the elementary amplitudes @xmath101 are hard to identify unambiguously once the semiclassical domain has been left .",
    "the more general amplitudes @xmath120 have a plethora of resonance poles for generic values of @xmath5  either @xmath121 or @xmath122 , depending on whether @xmath123 or @xmath124  and the classification of the resonances in multiparticle scattering , necessary to see the unstable particles of height greater than @xmath125 , becomes more and more involved as the number of particles increases .",
    "fortunately , there are other physical observables , such as correlation functions and finite - size effects , where all types of particles play similar roles , setting the scales of crossover phenomena .",
    "this is because the effective behaviour of the system at a given scale depends on the number of particle states which are effectively light at that scale , irrespective of their stability .",
    "examining the system at different scales thus provides a well - defined method to detect the existence of physical mass scales associated with both stable and unstable particles .",
    "there is just one limitation : the nature of crossover phenomena means that their study can not provide the values of mass scales with arbitrary precision .",
    "in fact , this is not surprising : while the masses of the _ stable _ particles can alternatively be extracted , with in principle arbitrary accuracy , from the far - infrared asymptotics of correlation functions and finite - size data , no such option can exist for the unstable particles , given the uncertainty principle .    in the next sections we shall study the finite - size behaviour of generic hsg models using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz , or tba .",
    "mass scales can only be picked up approximately , and some may be impossible to split apart , but within these limitations we find complete agreement with the idea that there is a scale in the quantum theory associated with each positive root of @xmath8 , given by eqs .   and   as a function of the @xmath42-matrix parameters @xmath126",
    "this is consistent with the idea that all of the semiclassical soliton particles survive in the quantum theory as stable or unstable particles , for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , taking   into account , our results indicate that , at least for @xmath114 , the commonly - used formula @xmath127 _ fails _ to characterise the mass scales of the unstable particles , and favour the use of @xmath95 instead .",
    "[ classicalscales ]  the classical theories depend on @xmath128 independent parameters , but have a set of solitonic particle states for each of the @xmath129 positive roots . for generic values of the parameters ,",
    "the masses assigned to these roots by the formula will all be different , and if mass scales could be discerned with arbitrary precision , one might hope to distinguish @xmath129 different values .",
    "however , this is too much to expect in the quantum theory : as just discussed , unstable particles only show up in resonance poles or crossover phenomena , and these do not yield sharply - defined mass scales .",
    "the most that can be asked is to pick up _ well - separated _ scales , and this raises the question of how many of these can be manufactured by varying the @xmath128 parameters at our disposal . even at the classical level",
    "this is a non - trivial problem , the investigation of which forms the topic of the present section . with this out of the way we shall return to the quantum theory in section [ tbasec ] .",
    "before we begin , we should explain what we mean by ` well - separated ' .",
    "the theory has @xmath38 parameters ; for two scales to be well - separated , we mean that their ratio can be made arbitrarily large by varying those parameters , while leaving the overall ordering of all scales in the model unchanged .",
    "there may of course be many ways to do this , but one general prescription will be given in eq .",
    "below . at some stages",
    "we shall also consider the logarithms of well - separated quantities , whose _ differences _ can be made large ; to distinguish between the two concepts , we set up the following notation : @xmath130 where the constants @xmath131 and @xmath132 can be made arbitrarily large by varying the available parameters , uniformly for all quantities under discussion .",
    "in particular , @xmath133 .",
    "the classical discussion starts with the mass formula , which we repeat here : @xmath134 where @xmath135 our task is to characterise , for given values of the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 , how many separated scales appear in the set of numbers @xmath138 .    expanding @xmath66 in the basis of simple roots @xmath139 , @xmath140 where the non - negative integers @xmath141 are all of order one ( the largest possible value , found for the highest root of the @xmath142 theories , is @xmath143 ) . substituting into , @xmath144 and",
    "thus all squared masses are linear combinations of the @xmath145 quantities @xmath146 with coefficients @xmath147 that are fixed , and so independent of the parameters @xmath148 , and are the squares of numbers of order one .",
    "therefore , we can be sure that the model has no more than @xmath145 separable scales , given by the numbers @xmath149 only in the @xmath150 theories , for which @xmath151 , is @xmath145 equal to the number of positive roots  in all other cases it is smaller .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the maximal number of separated mass scales that a classical hsg model can exhibit is generally less than the number of positive roots .",
    "however , two more issues remain .",
    "first , we should check that the @xmath152 really can be separated .",
    "second , since these scales only ever appear in the linear combinations , for a given configuration of the parameters , it could be that some numbers from the set never occur as the largest term in these sums , but rather are always swamped , or shielded , by other terms .",
    "this would mean that the number of scales actually present was less than a naive analysis of would suggest .",
    "the first issue is easily resolved by means of a specific example .",
    "take the particular choice @xmath153 and @xmath154 , for two real numbers @xmath155 .",
    "then @xmath156 for generic @xmath157 and @xmath158 with @xmath159 irrational this provides @xmath160 different scales , which can be made of arbitrarily different magnitude by choosing @xmath157 and @xmath158 large enough .",
    "the second question is more subtle , and requires some more detailed properties of root systems .",
    "consider a particular number from the set , say @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath162 then this can always be realised as the squared mass of a classical particle simply by taking @xmath163 in , and so we can take @xmath164 .",
    "for @xmath161 to appear in the sum for a specific root @xmath66 , it must be true that @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "now for any root @xmath66 , the set of simple roots @xmath167 such that @xmath168 is connected on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , there is a chain of nodes @xmath169 , on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 with @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath173 , and with @xmath174 neighbouring nodes on the dynkin diagram for @xmath175 .",
    "this means that whenever @xmath161 appears in one of the sums , it is inevitably accompanied by the terms @xmath176 and @xmath161 must be larger than all of these numbers if it is not to be swamped . taking square roots ,",
    "the condition for the scale @xmath177 not to be hidden by the other scales that always appear with it is that @xmath178 where the roots @xmath179 form the unique chain of simple roots on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 joining @xmath180 to @xmath181 .",
    "( the chain is unique since non - affine dynkin diagrams are trees . )",
    "conversely , suppose that is satisfied for @xmath182 .",
    "then , with @xmath179 again the chain of roots joining @xmath180 to @xmath181 , @xmath183 is a root of @xmath8 , and @xmath161 is realised as the squared mass scale for the classical particles associated with @xmath184  by , it dominates all other terms in the expression for @xmath185 .",
    "thus , gives a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath177 to be realised as the mass scale of a set of classical particle states in the model .",
    "there is a simple graphical method to check all of the conditions   at once .",
    "start by drawing a series of horizontal lines , or ` telegraph wires ' , one for each root in the chain @xmath179 . give each wire a coordinate @xmath186 running from @xmath187 to @xmath188 , and for each @xmath173 , paint those parts of the @xmath189 wire with @xmath190 a different colour , red",
    "without loss of generality , assume that @xmath191 ; otherwise relabel the chain so that @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "now draw a zig - zag line between the wires , starting at the point @xmath194 on the first wire ( @xmath195 , @xmath196 ) and then moving horizontally by an amount @xmath197 going from the @xmath189 to the @xmath198 wire .",
    "this way , the @xmath189 segment of the line joins the point @xmath199 on the @xmath189 wire to the point @xmath200 on the @xmath198 wire . by the time the last wire has been reached , the total horizontal shift is @xmath201 , and the zig - zag terminates at @xmath202 , on the @xmath203 wire",
    ".    then condition is equivalent to the following demand : @xmath204 this can be proved as follows .    moving from wire @xmath205 to wire @xmath206 ,",
    "the total horizontal shift of the zig - zag is @xmath207 . for this to fit between the red - painted regions of wires @xmath205 and @xmath206",
    ", the absolute value of @xmath208 must be less than the horizontal separation of these two regions , which is @xmath209 .",
    "hence @xmath210 and so , recalling , @xmath211 for the zig - zag to remain far from all red - painted regions , this condition must be met for all @xmath212 with @xmath213 .",
    "( note we include the cases @xmath214 , for which reduces to the requirement that there be a non - zero gap between the red - painted regions of the @xmath189 wire . ) dividing by @xmath125 and exponentiating , is recovered .",

    "the fact that the non - affine dynkin diagrams are trees , together with the antisymmetry of @xmath311 , means that the set of rapidities @xmath312 with which the pseudoenergy @xmath309 at @xmath313 interacts is finite .",
    "this contrasts with the original staircase models of @xcite , where for non - zero values of the resonance parameter and in the absence of energy terms the psedoenergies are coupled at infinitely - many shifted values of  @xmath244 .",

    "for values of @xmath258 such that this occurs , the solution of the tba system will depend on @xmath258 in a non - trivial way , causing the value of the effective central charge to change and signalling a crossover in the finite - size behaviour of the model .",
    "two conditions must be satisfied for the interaction to occur .",
    "taking the shift @xmath311 moving from node @xmath99 to node @xmath100 into account , the first is that either @xmath325 depending on whether @xmath106 or @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "both cases are summarised by @xmath326 where the presence of the modulus sign is consistent with the requirement that both @xmath327 and @xmath328 be non - negative .",
    "rearranging , the condition is @xmath329 in other words , @xmath330 , and the physical system size @xmath237 is of the order of the length - scale set by @xmath331 .",
    "taken over all values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , this yields exactly the set of crossover scales that one would predict on the basis of a nave analysis of the set of classical mass scales .",
    "however , the simple picture of a crossover for every pair of pseudoenegies , caused by the interaction between the corresponding pairs of kink systems , can break down once the effects of other energy terms are taken into consideration . according to",
    ", the energy terms force the functions @xmath332 to zero for @xmath333 , irrespective of the values of any other pseudoenergies . to take this into account",
    ", an additional condition is required to ensure that the chain of interactions connecting the kinks for @xmath309 and @xmath323 near to @xmath334 and @xmath335 is actually effective .",
    "suppose that @xmath106 , and let @xmath336 be the unique chain of adjacent nodes on the dynkin diagram joining nodes @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that @xmath337 and @xmath338",
    ". then , for any @xmath339 , the value of @xmath254 at @xmath340 is coupled to the value of @xmath341 at @xmath342 provided that @xmath343 .",
    "therefore , taking   into account , the required interaction between kinks will only take place if @xmath344 this is identical to the classical condition summarised by eq .  , which ensures that the ( classical ) scale @xmath152 is not shielded , and really does appear as the dominant term in the mass of some classical particle .",
    "therefore , we deduce that there is a crossover in the finite - size behaviour of the quantum model at @xmath330 for each _ unshielded _ mass scale @xmath152 within the set of numbers given by eq .  , where @xmath136 and @xmath54 are now the ( quantum ) tba parameters .",
    "this is one of our main results : for given values of the parameters , the set of distinct mass scales picked up by the finite - size crossover behaviour as the system size varies from zero to infinity is exactly the same as would have been predicted from an examination of the full set of classical particle masses , stable and unstable .",
    "this match includes the shielding of classical scales that was discussed in section [ classicalscales ] , and holds for all values of @xmath5 , and not just semiclassically .",
    "otherwise stated , for the quantum theory , the set of scales at which crossover phenomena occur is not @xmath345 , but rather @xmath346 , just as in the classical theory .",
    "these non - perturbative results also provide a quantitative test for the accuracy of the identifications of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as defined in section  [ partsec ] , with the physical mass scales of the unstable particles .",
    "take two neighbouring nodes on the dynkin diagram of @xmath8 , say @xmath71 , and consider the simple pole of the amplitude @xmath101 at @xmath102 . as explained just after  , when @xmath106",

    "are : @xmath348 for this range of parameters , the mass scale @xmath152 is unshielded , so @xmath349 .",
    "moreover , according to our results , the finite - size behaviour of the quantum model has a crossover at @xmath350 , a consequence of the decoupling of the unstable particles associated with the root @xmath70 .",
    "this singles out @xmath351 as the physical mass scale of the unstable particle and , comparing with and taking into account the approximate nature of the mass scales provided by the study of finite - size effects , shows that @xmath109 provides the correct value for the mass scale of this unstable particle .",
    "in contrast , the value of @xmath352 can be made arbitrarily far from the value of @xmath353 by letting @xmath119 tend to infinity . in this case ,",
    "our results clearly favour the use of @xmath354 to characterise the mass scale of the unstable particles against the more standard choice @xmath355 .    for @xmath356 , and for the same values of the parameters , the position of the pole on the complex @xmath75-plane",
    "is @xmath357 ( see  ) .",
    "this leads to the following values of the two candidate masses : @xmath358 which coincide in the large  @xmath5 limit , as expected .",
    "however , even at finite values of @xmath359 , and in contrast to the @xmath114 case , it is not possible to make an unambiguous choice between @xmath360 and @xmath361 .      at a crossover , the value of the effective central charge @xmath266 changes rapidly ; between any two separated crossovers it remains approximately constant .",
    "the next task is to calculate this constant , as it will help us to identify the fixed point being visited by the staircase flow .",
    "the calculation is largely standard ; for the aspects peculiar to staircase models , see also @xcite .    to place ourselves far from all crossovers ,",

    "( the precise reasons for these conditions , and what happens when they are broken , will be discussed in section [ effsection ] below . )",

    "this can not be achieved simply by taking @xmath258 to zero  this would just reproduce the far uv central charge of the model in every case . instead , to capture the intermediate plateaux , a more subtle ` multiple scaling limit ' should be taken .",

    "this can be shown as follows .",
