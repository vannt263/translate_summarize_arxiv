    "thermal effective actions are in general non - local in coordinate space because the temperature - dependent green functions contain parts which are non - analytic at the origin of the momentum - frequency space@xcite . in a theory with two interacting scalar fields ,",
    "one integrates out one of them to find the effective action for the other . at finite temperature ,",
    "provided the coupling is weak , one usually proceeds by applying perturbation theory , and then making an expansion in powers of frequency and momentum in order to obtain a local effective lagrangian .",
    "it is this latter expansion which leads to results which are not uniquely defined but depend on the path on the frequency - momentum plane through which the origin is approached .",
    "for example , when the perturbation is truncated at the self - energy level , the self - energy is non - analytic at the origin .",
    "the reason is that the expansion is around a singularity @xcite .",
    "this effect was noticed for the first time by abrahams and tsuneto in the 60 s , in the context of bcs theory , while they were studying time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory near zero temperature and near the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "later it became clear that it is the origin of debye screening and of plasma oscillations in qed @xcite .",
    "these two different physical phenomena correspond to two different ways of approaching the origin of the momentum - frequency plane .",
    "the effects of the non - analyticity have also been studied in qed@xmath2 @xcite and in qcd @xcite .",
    "the non - analyticity is also present in the graviton self - energy @xcite and in higher - order graviton diagrams @xcite . even in the much simpler case of interacting scalars",
    "the non - analyticity of the self - energy persists @xcite . in the case of interacting scalars ,",
    "an interesting remark is that , whenever the internal propagators in a loop have different masses , the self - energy is analytic at the origin @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the singularity is not at the origin anymore , allowing thus a uniquely defined expansion around the origin .",
    "this paper is based on the simple observation that an essential step of the renormalization group method ( rg ) applied to a theory with a self - interacting field , is to split the field in slow and fast components , and integrate out the fast field obtaining thus an effective action for the slow field @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the above discussion about thermal effective actions , when rg techniques are applied in the context of thermal field theory , we anticipate that effects originating in the non - analyticity will arise .",
    "we choose to examine this aspect of rg in the context of a 3-dimensional homogeneous self - interacting bosonic gas with weak repulsive interactions and discuss its possible physical significance in this case .",
    "however our analysis and conclusions should hold whenever rg is used at finite temperature .",
    "this choice of system was motivated by the renewed interest in the bose - einstein condensation due to its recent experimental realization . for the interacting gas ,",
    "the approach which is most often used is that of bogoliubov .",
    "however , this is just a mean - field type method and , in principle , one can improve upon it by using more sophisticated techniques .",
    "one possibility near the critical region is the renormalization group @xcite .    in the case of the homogeneous gas , there is an extra , more important reason for looking for alternatives to the bogoliubov approach . in the critical region ,",
    "the bogoliubov theory simply does not work because there are fluctuations around the mean - field that can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "this happens because , as the temperature approaches the critical temperature @xmath3 , the thermal cloud density develops an infrared singularity and thus diverges as the momentum tends to zero @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the basics of the bec formalism above the critical region .",
    "we then apply wilsonian renormalization and derive the flow equations for the parameters of the lagrangian .",
    "we point out the non - analytic structure of the rg correction to the interaction term ( vertex ) and follow this non - analyticity as it propagates to the flow equation for the interaction .    in section 3 , we calculate the non - trivial fixed pont of the system of the flow equations and find the critical exponent for the correlation length .",
    "we examine the way the non - analyticity affects the fixed point .",
    "we note that taking the non - analyticity into account shifts the value of the critical exponent closer to the experimental result .    in section 4 , we compare our work with @xcite where the issue of non - analyticity in the context of renormalization is also discussed .",
    "we point out that the conclusions of @xcite hold only at @xmath4 whereas the non - analytic behaviour which we are investigating in this paper is purely thermal and vanishes at zero temperature , thus being completely independent of the non - analyticity discussed in @xcite .    in section 5",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "when the two - body collisions between bosons are taken to be low - momentum or s - wave , the path integral representation of the partition function of the homogeneous interacting bose - gas is given by    @xmath5 e^{-s[\\phi,\\phi^ * ] }   \\label{partition}\\ ] ]    with the action @xmath6 =   \\frac{1}{\\hbar }   \\int_0^{\\hbar \\beta } d\\tau \\int_{v } d^d { \\bf x }    \\left [ \\phi^ * ( \\tau , { \\bf x } ) [ \\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau } - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\nabla^{2 } - \\mu ]   \\phi(\\tau , { \\bf x } ) + \\frac{1}{2 } g |\\phi(\\tau , { \\bf x})|^4   \\right ] .",
    "\\label{action}\\ ] ]    in the low - momentum approximation the interparticle interaction can be described by the zero - momentum component of the fourier transform of the two - body interaction potential .",
    "thus , within this approximation , a repulsive , short - range potential can be characterized by a positive interaction strength @xmath7 . in three spatial dimensions",
    "this interaction strength is related to the positive scattering length @xmath8 of the interparticle interaction by the familiar relation @xmath9 .",
    "the chemical potential is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the case @xmath11 holds for @xmath12 and corresponds to the uncondensed phase whereas @xmath13 describes the condensate which is formed when @xmath14 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will deal only with the uncondensed phase .",
    "starting from ( @xmath15 ) we can derive the renormalization group equations for @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "this set of coupled differential equations can then be used for the study of universal as well as non - universal properties of the gas @xcite . in the following",
    "we will set @xmath16 .    in order to implement the first step of the rg procedure ( kadanoff transformation ) , we split the field @xmath17 into a long - wavelength component @xmath18 and into a short - wavelength component @xmath19 .",
    "the short - wavelength field involves fourier components which are contained only in an infinitesimally thin shell in momentum space of thickness @xmath20 near the cutoff @xmath21 , whereas the long - wavelength field has all its fourier components in the sphere whose center is at the origin of the momentum space and its radius is @xmath22 .",
    "we impose no cutoff on the frequency and apply the wilsonian technique of consecutive infinitesimal shell integration only to the momentum and not to the frequency @xcite .",

    "it is essential in the rg procedure , and in particular in the kadanoff transformation , to recast the effective action obtained after integrating out the upper field in the form of the original action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the first trace is in a form that can be interpreted as a correction to the chemical potential .",
    "this is not the case however for the second trace ; there are quartic products of fields but , unlike the four - field coupling term in the original action ( [ action ] ) , these are non - local in coordinate space , thus not allowing the effective action to be recast in the form of the original action . in other words , though we start from an action containing interactions which are local in coordinate space , the rg procedure generates more general , non - local interactions .",
    "this is a well - known feature of rg , namely to generate extra terms that do not appear in the original action and have a more general form in comparison to what we started with @xcite .",

    "this procedure is usually called derivative expansion and is physically relevant only when the lower field is slowly varying both in space and in time .",
    "wilsonian renormalization is compatible with the derivative expansion .",
    "the reason is that in wilsonian renormalization we are interested in constructing an effective action for the slow field .",
    "this compatibility can also be seen from a more technical point of view ; the derivative expansion of the lower field is equivalent to an expansion of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in powers of @xmath55 and @xmath49 ( this is easily seen from ( [ inq ] ) doing integration by parts ) .",
    "this means that truncating the derivative expansion at higher than the leading order would give momentum and frequency dependent corrections to the interaction .",
