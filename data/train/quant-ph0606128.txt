    "part of the dogma of orthodox quantum mechanics is the presumed existence of _ superselection rules",
    "_  @xcite for certain quantities . for instance , it is often stated that one can not create or observe quantum coherence between eigenstates of differing charge , or of differing mass , or of number eigenstates of particles with differing statistics ( e.g. , a superposition of a boson and a fermion ) .",
    "originally , superselection rules were introduced to enforce additional constraints to quantum theory beyond the well - studied constraints of selection rules ( conservation laws ) . in a classic paper , aharonov and susskind",
    "@xcite challenged the necessity of such superselection rules , and outlined a gedanken experiment for exhibiting a coherent superposition of charge eigenstates as an example of how superselection rules can be obviated in practice .",
    "the gedanken experiment of aharonov and susskind , and subsequent investigations  @xcite , highlighted the requirement of an appropriate _ reference frame _ in order to exhibit coherence between eigenstates of superselected quantities .",
    "for example , while a reference frame for spatial orientation is required to exhibit coherence between states of differing angular momentum ( in some direction ) , a more exotic form of reference frame is required to exhibit coherence between states of differing charge .",
    "arguably , it is the ubiquity of reference frames for some quantities ( such as spatial orientation or phase ) and not for others ( such as the type of frame needed to exhibit superpositions of charge eigenstates ) that has led to the proposed superselection rules for some quantities and not others .",
    "while this gedanken experiment served to illustrate a concept , recent advances in the preparation and manipulation of exotic quantum states of matter may offer the opportunity to demonstrate these concepts in experiment . in this paper , we discuss the principles of an experiment that may be performed with ultracold atoms and molecules where the superselection rule in question is for atom number , or equivalently , baryon number .",
    "( the existence of such a superselection rule is commonly assumed , cf .",
    "the experiment we present aims to exhibit quantum coherence between states corresponding to a single atom and a diatomic molecule ; the reference frame in this case is a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "we advance this concept further by outlining a gedanken experiment to exhibit coherence between a boson and a fermion .",
    "we demonstrate that , using a reference frame consisting of many fermions in many modes , the essential features in this experiment are similar to those of the fully bosonic one , and that the commonly - accepted superselection rule disallowing superpositions of a boson and a fermion ( the univalence superselection rule  @xcite ) can be violated in principle .    aharonov and susskind used an operational approach to identify coherence between eigenstates of some superselected quantity : the observation of ramsey - type fringes in an interference experiment .",
    "the reference frame allows for the implementation of ramsey pulses to create and subsequently measure the superposition states .",
    "we follow this approach here , and extend their results by identifying several salient features of the reference frame that allow for high - visibility ramsey fringes for many repetitions of the experiment .",
    "we demonstrate that such a reference frame can be treated as either a classical or a quantum system , with both descriptions leading to equivalent predictions .",
    "in addition , we identify where in the mathematical formalism the coherent superpositions arise : if the reference frame is treated as a quantum system , this coherence arises in the relational degrees of freedom .    finally , our gedanken experiment to exhibit a coherent superposition of a boson and a fermion suggests that there must be an _",
    "additional _ requirement beyond the ability to repeatedly observe high - visibility interference fringes for one to say that a superselection rule has been `` lifted . ''",
    "we show that this gedanken experiment , despite possessing all of the salient features of a ramsey interferometry experiment , can not induce a well - defined _ relative _ phase between two distinct systems each described by a coherent superposition of a boson and a fermion .",
    "we therefore demonstrate that the ability to repeatedly violate a superselection rule is not equivalent to lifting it .",
    "consider a two - level atom , defined by two energy eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "how would one demonstrate coherence between these two states ?",
    "that is , how does one discriminate the coherent superposition @xmath2 from the incoherent mixture @xmath3 and observe the statistics .",
    "however , in practice , preparations and measurements are restricted to the basis @xmath4 .",
    "the standard method , then , is to perform an interference experiment , in the form of a ramsey interferometer , which we now outline .    between the preparation and the measurement",
    ", the interference experiment makes use of two types of evolutions .",
    "the first evolution is described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real number .",
    "this evolution is implemented by a laser tuned to the energy difference of these two levels , and this description is adequate if the laser pulse can be treated as an external potential ( i.e. , with a well - defined amplitude and phase ) .",
    "application of this hamiltonian for some finite time is called a _ ramsey pulse _ , and if this hamiltonian is applied for a time @xmath7 , the resulting unitary operation is called a @xmath8-pulse .",
    "the second type of evolution is governed by the free hamiltonian @xmath9 with @xmath10 the detuning between the energy splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath0 and the laser frequency when the laser is tuned off resonance .",
    "the interference experiment proceeds as follows .",
    "the system is prepared in the initial state @xmath0 , and then subjected to a @xmath8-pulse .",
    "the relative phase shift @xmath11 is then applied using the second type of evolution for a time @xmath12 , followed by another @xmath8-pulse . at the time of the preparation , and subsequent to each of the three interactions ,",
    "the state of the atom is , respectively , @xmath13 finally , the atom is measured in the @xmath14 basis . by controlling the magnitude of the phase shift @xmath11 between the pulses over many runs of the experiment , one observes so - called _ ramsey fringes _  oscillations in the probability of measuring the outcome corresponding to @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "such ramsey fringes are the signature of coherent operation , i.e. , that the description of the system for the time period between the two @xmath8-pulses is given by a coherent superposition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . if instead the system was described at this intermediate time by an incoherent superposition , then the resulting statistics would be independent of @xmath11 , i.e. , no fringes would be observed .",
    "see the experimental paper of bertet _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for a presentation of a ramsey interferometry experiment that takes a similar perspective to the one adopted in this paper .",
    "the basic structure of this ramsey interference experiment has analogies in many other quantum systems .",
    "an experiment using a single photon and a mach - zender interferometer is formally equivalent , with beamsplitters acting in the role of the ramsey pulses ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : atommoleculefig ] . other analogous experiments",
    "are commonplace in atomic , molecular and nuclear systems , and have more recently been demonstrated in artificial structures such as semiconductor quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting qubits  @xcite . because the same abstract structure can be realized in a wide variety of physical systems , the identification between these different realizations of the same basic interference experiment has been called the `` quantum rosetta stone ''  @xcite .",
    "we seek to add another realization to this list .",
    "we now consider an analog of the ramsey experiment that aims to exhibit coherence between a single atom and a molecule .",
    "consider a bosonic atom ; we denote the species of this atom as type 1 . also , consider a diatomic bosonic molecule , denoted @xmath15 , which consists of one atom of type 1 and one other bosonic atom of another type , 2 .",
    "we now define a two - level system , which will serve as the analogue in our experiment of the two - level atom in the ramsey experiment .",
    "this two - level system is spanned by the following basis states : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fock state for an atomic mode of type @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a fock state for a diatomic molecule mode .",
    "one may consider the single atom state , @xmath20 , as the analogue of the ground state of the two - level atom in the ramsey experiment , and the molecule state @xmath21 as the analogue of the excited state of this two - level atom .",
    "the aim is to demonstrate coherence in this two - level system , i.e. , coherence between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "such a demonstration of coherence violates a superselection rule for atom number .",
    "we will use a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of atoms of type @xmath22 to serve as our reference frame , i.e. , as the analogue of the electromagnetic field that constitutes the ramsey pulse .",
    "( the use of a bec as a phase reference has been discussed in  @xcite . )",
    "the analogue of the ramsey pulse in our experiment is given by an interaction of the two - level system with the reference frame ( the bec ) .",
    "the relative phase shift will be implemented by free evolution of the system .",
    "using these two basic evolutions we will describe an experiment that is formally equivalent to ramsey interferometry .      in the ramsey interference experiment presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] , the laser pulse which served as a reference frame was treated as a external potential .",
    "however , another description of the same experiment could be presented wherein the laser pulse was treated as a dynamical quantum system . in general ,",
    "different descriptions of the same interference experiment are possible depending on whether the reference frame is treated as a non - dynamical macroscopic apparatus or as a dynamical quantum system . in the language of  @xcite to treat the reference frame as part of",
    "the apparatus is to use it as an _ external _ reference frame , while to treat it as a dynamical quantum object is to use it as an _ internal _ reference frame .",
    "we begin by treating the reference frame  in this case , the bec  as a fully - dynamical quantum system . at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : relational ] , we will demonstrate that this experiment is equivalent to the ramsey interference experiment described in the previous section when the reference frame ( the bec ) is treated externally .      for simplicity",
    ", we adopt a single - mode description of the bec .",
    "the single mode corresponds to the gross - pitaevski ground state , which has had great success in describing bec dynamics  @xcite .",
    "following the terminology of  @xcite we refer to the three modes  the mode of atom type 1 , the molecular mode , and the bec mode  together as the _ _ laboratory__. states of the laboratory are most generally defined on the fock space @xmath23 spanned by the basis of fock states @xmath24 are occupation numbers for the modes . in our experiment , @xmath25 will be a constant of the motion . initially , it has eigenvalue @xmath18 , as we consider an initial state consisting of precisely one atom of type @xmath18 and zero molecules .",
    "thus , we can restrict our attention to the two - dimensional subspace of @xmath26 spanned by the two states @xmath20 and @xmath21 of eq .  .",
    "we refer to this two - level system as the _ system _ , and the hilbert space associated with it ( spanned by @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) is denoted @xmath27 .",
    "the _ reference frame _ is the remaining mode describing the bec of atomic species @xmath22 , with infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath28 .",
    "states of the laboratory ( system + reference frame ) are thus defined on @xmath29 .",
    "we will use the modified dirac notation @xmath30 for the state of the reference frame , to emphasize the special role it plays .",
    "the bec consists of atoms of type @xmath22 in a single mode ( the gross - pitaevski ground state mentioned above ) . in simplistic treatments ,",
    "it is common to treat the condensate as a coherent state , i.e. , to assign a state @xmath31 , defined in the number basis as @xmath32 with @xmath33 , as the quantum state of the bec .",
    "however , as argued in  @xcite , the coherence properties of a state assigned to a bosonic mode are defined relative to a classical reference frame for phase that is held in the background . if the phase of the bec is uncorrelated with any classical phase reference in the background , as we will assume in our experiment",
    ", then it is instead appropriate to assign it a quantum state that is incoherently averaged over all possible orientations with respect to the background phase reference .",
    "such a state is given by @xmath34 it is straightforward to show that this state is equal to a poissonian mixture of number states @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a poisson distribution with @xmath37 .",
    "it is this state , @xmath38 , that we choose to describe the bec .",
    "the treatment of the bec as an incoherent state is consistent with the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "is particularly useful as a pedagogical tool for understanding interference experiments such as the one described here : the state @xmath38 can be intuitively viewed as a coherent state @xmath31 , the phase of which ( arg@xmath39 ) is uncorrelated with any classical phase reference used to describe the experiment .",
    "if the bec mode is initially described by this mixed state @xmath38 , and the system starts in the state @xmath20 , then the initial state of the laboratory may be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 and where the total atom number operator @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 we define the _ twirling operator _ acting on density operators on the laboratory as @xmath44 = \\int_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi}e^{-i\\hat{n}_{\\rm tot}\\theta }    \\rho_l e^{i\\hat{n}_{\\rm tot}\\theta}\\,.\\ ] ] then @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "it will be illustrative to follow the evolution of the @xmath46 element @xmath47 of the ensemble in eq .   through the experiment , bearing in mind that the global phase @xmath48 is not physically significant , and the quantum state of the laboratory is obtained by averaging over this phase ( implemented by the twirling operation @xmath49 ) .",
    "we now outline the hamiltonians that will be used to induce the required evolutions in our gedanken experiment .",
    "the first is an interaction between the system and the quantum reference frame . at a feshbach resonance , which occurs when an external magnetic field is tuned so that the energy of two free atoms is equal to that of a bound molecular state , coherent tunneling occurs between pairs of atoms and molecules .",
    "a simple model hamiltonian for this phenomena , where the two atoms are of different species is  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the annihilation operator for the bound molecular state , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are annihilation operators for the modes containing the two distinct atomic species .",
    "this hamiltonian can be reexpressed in terms of an operator on the hilbert space @xmath29 of the laboratory as @xmath54    we will also make use of a hamiltonian that induces a relative phase shift on the system .",
    "such a hamiltonian is provided by moving off of the feshbach resonance and allowing free evolution under the hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are the internal energies of the two atomic species and the molecule away from the feshbach resonance .",
    "there will be some internal energy difference between the bound molecular state and the sum of the two free atomic states when off - resonance , given by @xmath58 we note that both @xmath42 and @xmath59 are constants of the motion , and thus we can move to an interaction picture in which the free - evolution hamiltonian on @xmath27 is simply @xmath60 up to addition of a constant .",
    "we initiate the experiment with the laboratory in the state @xmath61 of eq .  .",
    "the system and reference frame first interact for a time @xmath62 at the feshbach resonance according to  .",
    "this interaction plays the role of a ramsey pulse . as a result of this interaction ,",
    "the state of the laboratory evolves ( in the schrdinger picture ) to @xmath63 $ ] , with @xmath64 where we have defined unnormalized states @xmath65 we can interpret these states as ( unnormalized ) coherent states that have undergone a disturbance due to the interaction with the system .",
    "next , we allow the laboratory to freely evolve for time @xmath66 away from the feshbach resonance according to  .",
    "this free evolution induces a relative phase between the atom and molecule terms .",
    "the result is a state @xmath67 $ ] , with @xmath68 and where we have defined @xmath69 as the net relative phase shift between the atom and molecule terms acquired during this stage .",
    "finally we implement the analogue of the second ramsey pulse by allowing the system and reference frame to interact again at the feshbach resonance for time @xmath70 , giving the final state @xmath71 $ ] , with @xmath72 where we have defined unnormalized states @xmath73 and where we have ignored the global phase ( @xmath74 ) in the final states .",
    "finally , the system is measured in the @xmath75 basis .",
    "we now examine the limit @xmath76 .",
    "the poisson distribution of the state   has two key properties that will be useful for our purposes .",
    "first , in this limit , the atom number distribution @xmath77 of the bec becomes highly peaked about the mean atom number in the sense that the standard deviation in atom number , @xmath78 , goes to zero relative to the mean .",
    "this property ensures that the interaction of the system with the bec yields precisely a @xmath8 ramsey pulse in this limit .",
    "component of the reference - frame state induces a rabi oscillation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 at frequency @xmath79 . in the limit @xmath80 ,",
    "the fact that the uncertainty in @xmath81 goes to zero relative to the mean ensures that all relevant oscillations occur at the same frequency .",
    "] the second property is that , in absolute terms , the standard deviation grows unbounded and so intuitively we might think that the state of the bec is negligibly disturbed by the loss of a single atom in this limit .",
    "formally , the states of the reference frame after the first and second interactions approach the following limits . ] as @xmath80 @xmath82 therefore , in the limit @xmath80 , the evolution of the @xmath46 term of eq .  , that is , the evolution of @xmath47 given by eqns .  , , and , reduces to @xmath83 we see that the @xmath46 term ( in fact , any term ) remains a product on @xmath29 for the entire experiment .",
    "moreover , applying the twirling operator @xmath49 to such a product yields a separable state , which involves classical correlations between the system and the reference frame but no entanglement .",
    "in addition , we note that in this limit the reduced density operator of the reference frame remains @xmath38 of eq .   at each stage ; i.e. , the reference frame is left undisturbed throughout the experiment .",
    "the probabilities for detecting an atom or molecule at the end display ramsey oscillations @xmath84 this interference pattern has perfect visibility .",
    "we see therefore that the probabilities for detecting an atom or molecule exhibit the familiar ramsey oscillations , identified in sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] as the operational signature of coherence .",
    "so it would seem that we can safely conclude that this experiment demonstrates the possibility of a coherent superposition of an atom and a molecule .",
    "however , the careful reader might have noted the following peculiar fact . from eqs .   and",
    ", we find that the reduced density operators on @xmath27 of @xmath85 or @xmath86 are @xmath87 respectively .",
    "the reduced density operators on @xmath27 of @xmath88 and @xmath89 are obtained from these by averaging over @xmath90 through the use of the twirling operator @xmath49 . in both cases",
    ", this state is found to be the completely mixed state @xmath91 , i.e. , an _",
    "incoherent _ mixture of an atom and a molecule .",
    "thus , we have a puzzle : we have clearly predicted the standard operational signature of coherence , namely ramsey - type fringes , but the coherence is not present in our mathematical description of the system .    before suggesting the resolution of this puzzle , we shall demonstrate that it is not unique to the atom - molecule example we are considering .",
    "we find precisely the same peculiarity in the context of the original ramsey experiment , as follows .    within the analysis of the ramsey experiment presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] , the electromagnetic field constituting the ramsey pulses was treated as an external potential . as is well known ,",
    "this description is perfectly adequate if the fields have large amplitude . but note that one could have also chosen to treat this em field _ within _ the quantum formalism , as a dynamical system interacting with the atom .",
    "we emphasize that whether the reference frame ( the em field ) is treated internally or externally is merely a choice of the physicist .",
    "as long as the field has large amplitude , either description is adequate to the task of making accurate predictions about what will be observed by the experimenter .    treating the reference frame internally",
    ", we can take the state of the field to be a coherent state of a single bosonic mode associated with a bosonic annihilation operator @xmath92 .",
    "the phase is unimportant ( i.e. , the demonstration of ramsey oscillations does not depend on the phase of the coherent state ) , so one obtains the same experimental predictions if this state is averaged over all phases  @xcite , i.e. , if one uses a quantum state for the em field of the same form as the bec state of eq .  .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian for interacting the two - level atom with the em field in this internalized description is the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath93 starting with the coherent state averaged over all phases for the em field and the jaynes - cummings interaction hamiltonian , one is led to a description of the original ramsey experiment that is _ precisely equivalent _ to the one we have just provided for the atom - molecule system .",
    "along with being formally equivalent to our atom - molecule experiment , this description of the ramsey experiment with an internalized reference frame is operationally equivalent to the one presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : ramsey ] , and necessarily makes the same predictions . in particular , it agrees with the model of sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] in predicting the presence of ramsey fringes .",
    "given that such a model is formally equivalent to the atom - molecule experiment presented in the previous section , we see that that the latter _ necessarily _ predicted the presence of such fringes .",
    "we now turn to the resolution of this puzzle , which applies to both our proposed atom - molecule experiment as well as the ramsey experiment .",
    "we denote the system by @xmath94 and the reference frame by @xmath95 . in the case of the ramsey experiment , @xmath94 is the atom and @xmath95 is the em field constituting the ramsey pulse , while in the case of the atom - molecule interference experiment , @xmath94 is the mode pair of atom mode and molecule mode and @xmath95 is the bec constituting the analogue of the ramsey pulse .    in such an experiment ,",
    "if the reference frame is treated externally , the total hilbert space is denoted @xmath27 and the quantum state on this hilbert space describes _ the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath95_. as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] , the observation of fringes in this experiment implies coherence between states @xmath0 and @xmath1 of this particular relational degree of freedom . alternately ,",
    "if the reference frame is treated internally , the total hilbert space is denoted by @xmath96 ; however , in this description the quantum state on @xmath27 describes the relation between @xmath94 and a _ background _ reference frame , distinct from @xmath95 .",
    "thus although it is standard practice to use a common notation , the hilbert space we denote by @xmath27 when @xmath95 is treated externally and the hilbert space we denote by @xmath27 when @xmath95 is treated internally describe _ distinct _ degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , it is a mistake to think that a coherent superposition of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath27 when @xmath95 is treated externally necessarily implies a coherent superposition of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 on @xmath27 when @xmath95 is treated internally . specifically , if one investigates only the reduced density matrix on @xmath27 when @xmath95 is treated internally , no coherence will be found because the reference frame @xmath95 relative to which these coherences are defined has been discarded in taking the partial trace . to find the relation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 when the latter is treated internally , one should not look to the reduced density operator on @xmath27 but rather to the reduced density operator on a different hilbert space : one for which its degrees of freedom are the _ relation _ between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in the following section , we identify this relational hilbert space and",
    "demonstrate that when ramsey fringes are observed , states in this hilbert space are indeed coherent .",
    "we now provide the details of the relational description .",
    "this description could be viewed as an example of quantum coherence in the presence of unobservable quantities , in this case the overall phase , discussed in  @xcite .",

    "( one such measurement would be the two - outcome projection onto the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces of the relational hilbert space .",
    "if the two systems are in phase , the symmetric outcome is obtained with certainty . ) for the bosonic reference frames explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : atommol ] , it is straightforward to show that this is indeed the case .",
    "however , for the fermion reference frame introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonfermioncoherence ] , such an experiment would be completely insensitive to @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for this insensitivity is that , for the interactions describing the @xmath8 pulses , each of the two systems would interact with a _ different _ random mode of the reference frame .",
    "as the individual reference - frame modes are uncorrelated in phase , the two systems would also be uncorrelated .",
    "thus , although our second example of a ramsey interference experiment exhibits a coherent superposition of a single fermionic atom and a bosonic molecule , we do not currently foresee how such an experiment can be directly generalized to create arbitrary superposition states of multiple systems .",
    "the form of reference frame used in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonfermioncoherence ] does not lift the superselection rule , but provides only a demonstration of a violation of this rule in a single system .",
    "we conclude by responding to some anticipated objections by a skeptic who questions that our gedanken - experiments would exhibit a coherent superposition of a single atom and a molecule .",
    "suppose a skeptic asserted that the only adequate description of the atom - molecule interference experiments is the one wherein the bec is internalized , that is , treated quantum mechanically .",
    "she could appeal to the fact that there is no coherence between the states @xmath20 and @xmath21 on @xmath27 in this description to argue that a coherent superposition of atom and molecule had actually _ not _ been generated .",
    "we would of course disagree with the assessment that internalizing the reference frame is the only way to obtain an adequate description of the experiment , but leaving this aside , one can respond to such a skeptic by noting that this argument would also apply to the ramsey experiment outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : ramsey ] .",
    "the reason is that when the em field in the ramsey experiment is treated quantum mechanically , then the reduced density operator on the hilbert space of the atom has no coherence between the internal states @xmath20 and @xmath274 .",
    "thus , a skeptic could deny that we have demonstrated the possibility of having a coherent superposition of atom and molecule , but then she would also have to deny that the ramsey interference experiment demonstrates coherence between two internal states of an atom .",
    "in fact , the sort of argument the skeptic is presenting can be applied to essentially _ any _ degree of freedom that requires a reference frame for its definition .",
    "for instance , suppose one internalized the reference frame for spatial orientation or for the spatial position of a system .",
    "then by exactly analogous arguments to those presented here , the reduced density operator on the hilbert space of the system would be found to be an _",
    "incoherent _ sum of angular momentum or linear momentum eigenstates .",
    "thus , a dogmatic insistence on the necessity of internalizing reference frames would lead one in this context to conclude that it is impossible to prepare coherent superpositions of angular momentum or linear momentum eigenstates .",
    "but although the latter quantities are conserved , no one feels that it is fruitful to insist on a superselection rule for them .",
    "the only real difference we can see between reference frames for spatial orientation , position , or the phase of the internal state of an atom , on the one hand , and for the phase conjugate to charge , atom number , or univalence on the other , is that reference frames of the first sort are ubiquitous while those of the latter sort are difficult to prepare .",
    "any rigid object can act as a reference frame for spatial position , whereas a reference for the phase conjugate to atom number presumably requires one to have succeeded in the experimentally challenging task of achieving and maintaining bose - einstein condensation for that atomic species .    along these lines",
    ", we note that the recent demonstrations of ramsey fringes in so - called `` superconducting qubits '' in a single - cooper - pair box configuration  @xcite is analogous in many ways to the experiments we propose here ( see @xcite for related theory ) .",
    "this experiment demonstrates coherence between states of differing charge , i.e. , of states of a superconducting island which differ by charge @xmath275 ( the charge of a single cooper pair ) .",
    "the reference frame for this system , which is used to implement the ramsey pulses , is a nearby superconductor , the state of which  a bcs ground state  has an accurate and successful description as a classical field .",
    "this superconducting qubit experiment can be interpreted as violating a superselection rule for charge  @xcite , in direct analogy with the way that the interference experiments proposed here can be interpreted as violating a superselection rule for atom - number .",

    "the intuition for expecting this result is that the total number of fermions in the reference frame is indeterminate ( a binomial distribution ) so that in the limit of large number of fermions , distributed in an even larger number of modes , we will not be able to tell if one of the modes has interacted with the system and possibly lost one fermion .",
    "the random coupling of the map @xmath288 ensures that we do not know which fermion mode to look at .    from",
    "it is clear that the non - trivial step is to show that @xmath289 and @xmath290 are indistinguishable in the limit .",
    "we will use the fidelity , defined as  @xcite @xmath291 as our measure of the indistinguishability of two states @xmath265 and @xmath180 , where @xmath292 implies that the states are completely indistinguishable . for states @xmath293 and @xmath294 diagonal in the same basis the fidelity reduces to @xmath295 therefore the fidelity of these two states is @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the probability of the most likely number of fermions ( the floor or ceiling of the mean ) and we have not written explicitly the dependence on @xmath298 of the binomial probabilities .",
    "therefore from   it is clear that the fidelity @xmath299 between the two postselected states also approaches @xmath18 in the limit @xmath225 .",
    "similar calculations show the same result for the postselected states of the reference frame at either of the intermediate times in the experiment , eqs .   or substituted into eq .  .",
    "furthermore either of the postselected states of the reference frame at any time during the experiment can be shown to have fidelity approaching @xmath18 with the initial state @xmath300 in the same limit .",
