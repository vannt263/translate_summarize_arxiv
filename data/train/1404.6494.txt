    "since quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) was established as the fundamental theory of strong interaction @xcite , it has been an important problem in theoretical physics to clarify color confinement and spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of many and various studies , these two nonperturbative phenomena have not been well understood directly from qcd .",
    "dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking in qcd is categorized as well - known spontaneous symmetry breaking , which widely appears in various phenomena in physics .",
    "the standard order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking is the quark condensate @xmath8 , and it is directly related to low - lying dirac modes , as the banks - casher relation indicates @xcite . here",
    ", dirac modes are eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xmath9 , which directly appears in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "in contrast to chiral symmetry breaking , color confinement is a quite unique phenomenon peculiar in qcd , and the quark confinement is characterized by the area law of the wilson loop , i.e. , non - zero string tension , or the zero polyakov loop , i.e. , infinite single - quark free energy .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath0 is one of the typical order parameters , and it relates to the single - quark free energy @xmath10 as @xmath11 at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the polyakov loop is also an order parameter of spontaneous breaking of the @xmath13 center symmetry in qcd @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of each nonperturbative phenomenon , to clarify the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking is one of the challenging important subjects in theoretical physics @xcite , and their relation is not yet clarified directly from qcd .",
    "a strong correlation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking has been suggested by almost coincidence between deconfinement and chiral - restoration temperatures @xcite , although slight difference of about 25mev between them is pointed out in recent lattice qcd studies @xcite .",
    "their correlation has been also suggested in terms of qcd - monopoles @xcite , which topologically appear in qcd in the maximally abelian gauge . by removing the monopoles from the qcd vacuum , confinement and chiral symmetry breaking",
    "are simultaneously lost @xcite , which indicates an important role of qcd - monopoles to both phenomena , and thus these two phenomena seem to be related via the monopole .    as another type of pioneering study , gattringer and bruckmann _",
    "_ showed that the polyakov loop can be analytically expressed with the dirac eigenvalues under the temporally twisted boundary condition for temporal link - variables @xcite .",
    "although temporal ( nontwisted ) periodic boundary condition is physically required for link - variables in real qcd at finite temperature , such an analytical formula would be useful to consider the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .    in a series of our recent studies @xcite",
    ", we have numerically investigated the wilson loop and the polyakov loop in terms of the `` dirac - mode expansion '' , and have found that quark confinement properties are almost kept even in the absence of low - lying dirac modes .",

    "the wilson loop is expressed by the functional trace @xcite @xmath178 where we introduce the `` staple operator '' @xmath179 as @xmath180 here , the wilson - loop operator is factorized as a product of @xmath179 and @xmath181 , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "we note that @xmath182 for enough large volume lattice @xcite .",
    "defined on a @xmath176 rectangle .",
    "the right figure shows the factorization of the wilson - loop operator as a product of @xmath183 and @xmath181 .",
    "here , @xmath12 , @xmath177 , and the lattice size are arbitrary . ]    in the case of even number @xmath12 , let us consider the functional trace of @xmath184 from the similar arguments in sect.3 , we obtain @xmath185 and @xmath186 therefore , we obtain for even @xmath12 the simple formula of @xmath187 again , owing to the factor @xmath188 , the contribution from low - lying dirac modes is expected to be small also for the wilson loop , although the matrix element @xmath189 includes explicit @xmath12-dependence and its behavior is not so clear , unlike the formula ( [ eq : plvsd ] ) for the polyakov loop .    in the case of odd",
    "number @xmath12 , the similar results can be obtained by considering @xmath190 instead of @xmath191 . actually , one finds @xmath192 and @xmath193 so that one finds for odd @xmath12 the similar formula of @xmath194    finally , for even @xmath12 case , we show the inter - quark potential @xmath195 and the string tension @xmath7 . from the expression ( [ eq : wilson ] ) for the wilson loop @xmath196 , we obtain the inter - quark potential @xmath195 and the string tension @xmath7 : @xmath197 @xmath198 because of the factor @xmath188 in the sum , the low - lying dirac - mode contribution is to be small for the wilson loop @xmath196 , the inter - quark potential @xmath195 and the string tension @xmath7 , unless the extra counter factor @xmath199 appears from @xmath200 . also for odd @xmath12 case ,",
    "similar arguments can be done with eq.([eq : wilsonodd ] ) .    in this way ,",
    "the string tension @xmath7 , or the confining force , is expected to be unchanged by the removal of the low - lying dirac - mode contribution , which is consistent with our previous numerical works of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "taking the assumption ( [ eq : assumption ] ) in sec.2.4 , the removal of low - lying dirac modes of @xmath9 leads to an approximate removal of low - lying modes of the fermionic kernel @xmath29 $ ] , which largely reduces the chiral condensate .",
    "then , the above suggested insensitivity of confinement to low - lying dirac modes indicates no direct one - to - one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "we have derived an analytical gauge - invariant formula between the polyakov loop @xmath0 and the dirac eigenvalues @xmath1 as @xmath2 in lattice qcd with odd - number temporal size @xmath3 , by considering @xmath201 , on the ordinary square lattice with the normal ( nontwisted ) temporally - periodic boundary condition for link - variables . here , @xmath4 denotes the dirac eigenstate , and @xmath5 temporal link - variable operator .",
    "this formula is a dirac spectral representation of the polyakov loop in terms of dirac eigenmodes @xmath4 , and expresses each contribution of the dirac eigenmode to the polyakov loop .",
    "because of the factor @xmath6 in the dirac spectral sum , this formula indicates fairly small contribution of low - lying dirac modes to the polyakov loop in both confinement and deconfinement phases , while these modes are essential for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "next , we have found a similar formula between the wilson loop and dirac modes on arbitrary lattices , without restriction of odd - number size .",
    "this formula suggests a small contribution of low - lying dirac modes to the string tension @xmath7 , or the confining force .",
    "thus , it is likely that low - lying dirac - modes have fairly small contribution to the polyakov loop and the string tension , and are not essential modes for confinement , while these modes are essential for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this suggests no direct one - to - one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . note here that the independence of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking would be natural , because heavy quarks are also confined even without light quarks or the chiral symmetry .    also for thermal qcd",
    ", we have investigated the relation between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking using the ratio of the susceptibility of the polyakov loop @xcite , of which importance for the deconfinement transition has been pointed out @xcite .    finally , we state some cautions and future works in this framework in order .    in sec.2.4 , for the strict connection to chiral symmetry breaking , we have assumed that each low - lying mode of the fermionic kernel @xmath29 $ ] is mainly expressed with the low - lying dirac modes of @xmath9 .",
    "we are now investigating this assumption ( [ eq : assumption ] ) quantitatively in lattice qcd @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have derived the dirac - mode expansion such as eq.([eq : plvsd ] ) , which is mathematically correct . in this expansion , each dirac - mode contribution is explicitly expressed , and we have focused on this explicit contribution",
    ". this treatment would be appropriate in quenched qcd . for more definite argument in full qcd , however , we have to clarify an implicit contribution of the dirac modes in the fermionic determinant , which can actually alter the properties of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is important to take the continuum limit of the mathematical formulae obtained on the lattice , although it seems a difficult problem .",
    "it is also interesting to compare with other lattice qcd result on the important role of infrared gluons ( below about 1gev ) for confinement in the landau gauge @xcite , in contrast to the insensitivity of confinement against low - lying dirac - modes .",
    "this work suggests some possible independence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , and this may lead to richer phase structure of qcd in various environment .",
    "in fact , there is an interesting possibility that qcd phase transition points can be generally different between deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration , e.g. , in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields , because of their nontrivial effect on the chiral symmetry @xcite .",
