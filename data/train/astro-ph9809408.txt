    "much has been discussed about the observed spectral x - ray properties of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) and numerous models that have been developed to account for these properties , during this workshop and in the literature . however , the spectral properties are only part of what we can learn from x - ray observations of these objects .",
    "bhcs are known to exhibit x - ray variability on a wide range of time scales from milliseconds to years ( see , e.g. , asm / rxte light curves on http://space.mit.edu/xte/asm_lc.html ) .",
    "the temporal properties contain information on some of the same physical properties of inverse comptonization processes ( hua & titarchuk 1996 ; cui et al .",
    "1997 ; kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) , which are believed to be responsible for producing hard x - ray emission from black hole candidates ( thorne & price 1975 ; coe et al .",
    "1976 ; shapiro et al .",
    "in addition , they add new information about the size of comptonizing regions ( hua & titarchuk 1996 ; cui et al .",
    "1997 ) , and perhaps their density structures ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ; hua et al . 1999 ; bttcher & liang 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , little has been done to _ quantitatively _ model the temporal properties of black hole candidates until very recently .",
    "i will review , in this paper , recent progress ( both observational and theoretical ) on this subject , with a focus on short - term variabilities ( @xmath0 hundreds of seconds ) which seem common among bhcs .",
    "the discovery of rapid x - ray variability in cyg x-1 ( oda et al .",
    "1971 ) quickly led to the speculation that such variability might be a signature for bhcs .",
    "we now know that similar phenomenon has also been observed in some of the x - ray bursters that are known to contain a weakly magnetized neutron star ( van der klis 1995 and references therein ) . nonetheless , rapid x - ray variability is universal and typically very strong in bhcs .",
    "an interesting question is what is the shortest time scale on which x - ray variability has been _ measured _ with high significance .",
    "this is a very important question because the answer to it immediately constrains the dimension of the x - ray emitting region . in practice",
    ", however , the answer depends on how well we can determine the level of poisson noise due to photon counting statistics , which in turn depends on how well we understand the physical processes that cause `` dead time '' in the electronics that collects and processes the data .",
    "the latter is usually poorly understood , so empirical models are often constructed , based on simulations , to estimate the instrumental noise level .",
    "for instance , the poisson noise level can be determined to within a fraction of one percent of the true value with this approach for the pca aboard rxte ( e.g. , cui et al .",
    "no claim should , therefore , be made of any detection of significant power within this level of uncertainty .",
    "the best studied bhc is cyg x-1 . even in this case",
    ", significant variability has reliably been detected only up to about 200 hz ( or 5 ms ; cf .",
    "van der klis 1995 ; see also belloni et al . 1996 , cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997c , and nowak et al .",
    "1998a for results from recent rxte observations ) .",
    "however , any bursts or flares of low duty cycles would be absent from power spectral analyses . in a time series analysis ,",
    "the estimation of the significance of an event on a short time scale is always complicated by the effects of intrinsic variability on much longer time scales ( press & schechter 1974 ) . with this in mind , careful analyses have been conducted for cyg x-1 , and similar conclusions have been reached : significant variability is confirmed by data only for time scales longer than several milliseconds ( meekins et al .",
    "it is , therefore , safe to conclude that rapid x - ray variability has only been _ observed _ in bhcs on time scales much longer than dynamical time scales in the immediate vicinity of central black holes ( assuming radiation field plays a negligible role in gas dynamics ) .",
    "for bhcs , the shape of power spectral density ( psd ) correlates strongly with spectral states .",
    "such correlation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] . in the low ( or hard ) state ,",
    "the psd can typically be characterized by a white noise at low frequencies that breaks into roughly a power law ( with an index @xmath1  @xmath2 ) beyond certain characteristic frequency .",
    "the cutoff frequency , @xmath3 , typically lies in the range 0.040.4 hz .",
    "the level of the white noise can vary while the power - law portion remains steady .",
    "belloni & hasinger ( 1990 ) noticed an interesting anti - correlation between the white noise level and @xmath3 for cyg x-1 : as the white noise level drops , @xmath3 increases .",
    "various subtle features of the power - density spectrum have also been reported ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1995 ) , such as another break at a higher frequency ( a few hz for cyg x-1 in the low state ; belloni & hasinger 1990 ) which might be related to the spatial distribution of `` seed photons '' in comptonization processes ( d. kazanas , private communication ) .    during a transition to the high state ,",
    "several things seem to happen ( cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b , 1997c ) : the low - frequency red noise ( or the `` 1/f '' noise ) strengthens ; the level of white noise drops ; @xmath3 increases to a few hz ; and a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) feature appears . as the high state is finally reached , the psd becomes dominated by the 1/f noise with an apparent break at high frequencies ( which might be similar to the second break in the low state ) .",
    "it has also been noted that in some cases the psd for the very - high state bears remarkable similarities to that for transitional periods , as do the spectral properties ( cui et al .",
    "1997c ; rutledge et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "there are exceptions to the canonical correlation .",
    "most notable are a subclass of bhcs that never seem exhibit high - state x - ray properties ( zhang et al . 1997b ) , even during an x - ray outburst ( van der klis 1995 ; cui et al .",
    "1997d ) , which is generally considered to be the high state for transient sources in terms of mass accretion rate .",
    "the cause is still not clear ( see zhang et al .",
    "1997b for a possible explanation on the spectral properties ) .",
    "there is a general lack of systematic investigations on the energy dependence of broad - band x - ray variability for bhcs ( see a brief summary by van der klis 1995 ) . with limited statistics",
    ", the dependence seems to be quite weak for both the low and high states .",
    "again use cyg x-1 as an example , the recent rxte observations of the source show that the psd varies little with photon energy , both in terms of the shape and the integrated fractional amplitude , for the low state ( nowak et al .",
    "1998a ) and high state ( cui et al .",
    "if anything , the overall fractional amplitude appears to decrease slightly toward high energies . during the transitional period between the two states",
    ", the energy dependence grows stronger ( cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997c ) : the 1/f noise strengthens toward high energies , accompanied by a drop of the white noise level .",
    "it is worth noting that in this case the cutoff frequency ( @xmath3 ) is rather insensitive to photon energy . for the very high state",
    ", the fractional amplitude seems to increase with photon energy ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ; rutledge et al .",
    "1998 ) , although the energy dependence of the psd shape seems to be rather complicated ( rutledge et al . 1998 )",
    ".    the majority of bhcs are transient x - ray sources . for these sources ,",
    "spectral state transitions are likely to be driven by an increase in the overall rate of mass accretion ( van der klis 1995 ) . typically , the x - ray intensity is more variable ( measured in terms of fractional amplitudes ) in the low state ( i.e. , low mass accretion rate ) than in the high state ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "the same is also true for cyg x-1 , a persistent source , although in this case the bolometric x - ray luminosity ( i.e. , the total mass accretion rate ) varies little during the state transition ( zhang et al .",
    "the rate of mass accretion through the disk is , however , likely to be higher in the high state , as indicated by the sudden jump in the soft x - ray flux as the source goes from the low state to the high state ( e.g. , cui et al .",
    "1997a ; zhang et al .",
    "therefore , the state transition in cyg x-1 is perhaps driven by a change in the relative importance between energy dissipation processes in the disk and through other channels ( such as the stellar wind ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 ) . for several sources in the low state",
    ", there appears to be an anti - correlation ( or correlation ) between the white noise level ( or @xmath3 ) and the _ disk _ accretion rate ( as measured by soft x - ray fluxes ) ( van der klis 1995 ) , perhaps implying the disk origin of noise processes .",
    "it has been well established in bhcs that high - energy x - ray photons systematically lag low - energy photons ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "tentative evidence for such lags was initially found in the form of asymmetries in cross - correlation functions between x - ray light curves in two energy bands for cyg x-1 ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1979 ) . at the time",
    ", the importance of inverse comptonization processes was already realized and fully appreciated : the hard power law tail on the observed energy spectrum for sources like cyg x-1 was thought to be the results of soft photons being upscattered by hot electrons in an optically thin region ( thorne & price 1975 ; coe et al .",
    "1976 ; shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ) . in the context of comptonization models ,",
    "the hard time lags are expected , since more scatters are required for photons to reach higher energies .",
    "consequently , the observed hard lags were conveniently interpreted this way .    to investigate hard lags for variation on different time scales , miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) computed cross power spectrum in fourier space , using data from ginga observations of cyg x-1 in the low state .",
    "as they derived the hard lag for each fourier frequency from the cross power spectrum , they were surprised by the strong frequency - dependence of the measured lags , which is entirely _ incompatible _ with the proposed comptonization models that had been otherwise successful in producing the observed power - law energy spectrum .",
    "it can be shown that comptonization processes in a uniform electron gas only produce a uniform shift between light curves in different energy band ( miyamoto et al .",
    "1988 ) ; a frequency - dependent lag would , on the other hand , require a differential `` stretching '' of light curves .",
    "this result led miyamoto et al . to question the applicability of the proposed models for sources like cyg x-1 .",
    "it is truly astonishing that this extremely important observational fact seems to have been completely forgotten or most likely ignored when models are developed to account for the observed _ spectral _ properties",
    ". numerous variations of comptonization models have been proposed ever since .",
    "success is often claimed as soon as a model seem to fit the energy spectrum , without any mention of its incompatibility with the observed frequency - dependence of hard lags ; such a model is , of course , not useful .",
    "systematic investigations of this issue have just begun ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ; hua et al . 1999",
    "; bttcher & liang 1998 ) .",
    "these studies have already made us realize that the incompatibility arises from the basic assumption of a uniform distribution of comptonizing electrons in nearly _ all _ models . also found is an intimate relationship between the frequency - dependence of hard lags and the density distribution ( spatial ) of hot electrons .",
    "more specifically , the observed hard lags can be accounted for with the proper choice of a density profile for the hot electron corona .",
    "these non - uniform corona models will be discussed in more detail in   4.1 .",
    "hard time lags and their dependence on fourier frequency appear to be a common phenomenon for bhcs ( see review by van der klis 1995 and a summary of recent results by hua et al .",
    "the frequency dependence is in general different for different sources , perhaps implying different density spatial profiles in the context of the non - uniform corona model ( hua et al .",
    "in fact , there are cases where no clear dependence of lags on frequency is detected ( miyamoto et al . 1992 ) .",
    "hard time lags have also been observed for different states .",
    "there is evidence that the frequency dependence of lags can be different in different states for some sources ( hua et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "although the measured time lags show a general logarithmic dependence on photon energy ( i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the effective energies of two bands between which the lag , @xmath7 , is measured ; cui et al .",
    "1997c ; crary et al .",
    "1998 ; nowak et al .",
    "1998a ) , as expected from comptonization processes ( e.g. , kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) , the proportionality constant is dependent of fourier frequency , as noted by nowak et al .",
    "( 1998a ) for cyg x-1 in the low state .",
    "i have carried out similar analyses for the high state and the transitional periods , using public data from rxte observations of cyg x-1 during its 1996 state transition . for completeness ,",
    "i have also analyzed two public rxte observations of cyg x-1 in the low state ( taken in june and october of 1997 , respectively ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] .",
    "the energy - dependence of the slope is apparent for all states , as clearly shown in the figure .",
    "it is worth noting that although the hard lag is , on average , smaller in the high state than that in the low state the difference is not as much as previously thought ( cui et al .",
    "also , the lag seems much larger during the transitions than that in either state",
    ". this might be artificial due to the variable nature of the low state and the randomness in our selection of observations for this state for comparison",
    ". however , our results for the low state are in good agreement with those of nowak et al .",
    "( 1998a ) whose observations were taken shortly after the state transition .",
    "this seems to imply the stability of underlying physical processes operating in the low state .",
    "these results , therefore , add further complications for theoretical models to reconcile with ( a detailed discussion of these results will be presented elsewhere ; cui et al . in preparation ) .",
    "complementary to hard lags , coherence functions are also of importance ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) .",
    "they measure the degree of linear correlation between x - rays at different energies in fourier domain , normalized in practice such that a value of 1 stands for perfect linear correlation and 0 for no correlation . if the measured value is less than 1 , the coherence function would not appear interesting , since numerous processes can be thought of to account for the loss of coherence .",
    "observations show , however , that coherence functions are generally near unity for bhcs in either low or high states ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ; cui et al .",
    "1997c ; smith et al . 1997",
    "; nowak et al .",
    "1998a ) , which put useful constraints on x - ray production processes and x - ray emitting environment ( hua et al .",
    "moreover , it was found that the loss of coherence is significant during state transitions , perhaps implying the variable nature of the comptonizing region on a time scale less than the duration of an observations ( @xmath81 hour ; cui et al .",
    "a qpo manifests itself in a well - localized broad peak in the psd .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude is customarily quoted to specify its strength , with respect to the average x - ray intensity .",
    "often , qpos represent transient events . while in some cases qpos are present in a well - defined range of mass accretion rate ( or x - ray flux ) or a well - defined spectral state , their presence is entirely unpredictable in other cases .",
    "there is a variety of qpos in bhcs , in terms of their basic characteristics ( frequency , width , and strength ) as well as the dependence of these characteristics on photon energy and x - ray intensity . as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] the power - density spectrum for grs 1915 + 105 from a public rxte observation made in may 5 , 1996 ( see also morgan et al .",
    "a sharply peaked qpo is prominent at 0.067 hz , along with its 3 harmonics ; the qpo at 0.8 hz is rather much broader and weaker ; and even weaker is a qpo at 67 hz .",
    "the frequency of qpos spans three decades for this source ! it should be emphasized that not all these qpos are present all the time ; a different set of qpos may be revealed by a different snapshot ( see morgan et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 has really pushed the study of x - ray variability in bhcs to an extreme . along with its cousin , gro j1655 - 40 ( mndez et al . 1998 ; remillard et al . 1998 ) ,",
    "the two microquasars have begun to revolutionize our view of qpos in bhcs .",
    "the study of qpos in bhcs is also one of the most important areas that rxte has contributed significantly .",
    "prior to the launch of rxte , the qpos were observed only at very low frequencies ( @xmath9 hz ; van der klis 1995 and references therein , although rutledge et al .",
    "1998 recently reported the detection of qpos of higher frequencies upon a re - analysis of ginga data ) , except for the very - high state qpos ( at a few hz ) .",
    "the rxte observations have now pushed the discovery space up to a few hundred hz ( remillard et al .",
    "of course , rich qpo phenomena are not limited to microquasars ; they have also been observed in `` normal '' bhcs , such as cyg x-1 ( cui et al .",

    "1997 ; remillard et al .",
    "1998 ) , although some follow the opposite trend ( morgan et al . 1997",
    "; see also remillard et al .",
    "1998 and rutledge et al . 1998 for other possible cases ) . in some cases",
    ", there is a correlation between the qpo properties and the hardness of x - ray emission ( cui et al . 1997c ; remillard et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these facts might be the key to understanding the origin(s ) of the qpos in bhcs , as will be discussed in   4.2 .",
    "investigations of the dependence of qpos on x - ray intensity are often complicated by the ambiguity in `` labeling '' and tracking a particular qpo over a wide intensity range . with very limited statistics ,",
    "we seem to have already seen all possibilities : some qpos show no correlation with x - ray fluxes ( cui et al .",
    "1997c ) ; the frequency of some increases with x - ray fluxes , while that of others decreases ( remillard et al .",
    "1998 ; rutledge et al . 1998 ) ; and , finally , certain qpos seem to maintain a stable frequency as x - ray fluxes vary ( morgan et al .",
    "1997 ; remillard et al .",
    "1998 ) , i.e. , the so - called `` stable qpos '' ( cui et al .",
    "therefore , it is almost certain that no single process can account for all qpos seen in bhcs .      like the broad - band variability , qpos also exhibit hard time lags ( van der klis 1995 ; cui et al . 1997c ) .",
    "a systematic study of qpo lags has become possible only recently with the rxte discovery of a variety of qpos in bhcs . for illustration ,",
    "[ fig-8 ] shows the measured hard lag of the 67 hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 ( see fig .",

    "the hard lags have also been measured for the low - frequency qpos in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "[ fig-9 ] shows the measured lags as a function of photon energy for the 0.133 hz qpo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that in one source the time lag associated with one qpo can be much larger than that with the others . in this case , the time lag scales roughly logarithmicly with photon energy , as would be expected from comptonization processes",
    ". more complicated energy dependence of qpo lags have also been reported ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "it appears to be generally true , however , that the larger the separation between two energy bands , the more hard x - ray photons lag soft ones .",
    "although shot - noise models ( e.g. , terrell 1972 ; sutherland et al .",
    "1978 ) have been popular in describing broad - band noise properties , they have shed little light on the physical origin(s ) of underlying noise processes .",
    "the strength of such models lies in the fact that they can mimic _ mathematically _ the observed light curves for bhcs .",
    "however , it has been noted that any stochastic time series can be simulated by a shot noise , with the proper choice of the shot profile , up to second - order statistics such as psd , auto- and cross - correlation functions ( doi 1978 ) . often , a distribution of shot profiles are required to account for subtle details ( canizares & oda 1977 ; ogawara et al .",
    "1977 ; nolan et al . 1981 ; meekins et al . 1984 ; belloni & hasinger 1990 ; lochner et al . 1991 ; negoro et al .",
    "for instance , the psd of cyg x-1 in the low state can drop rapidly above the cutoff frequency , following roughly a power law ; and the power - law index varies in the range @xmath2 to @xmath1 . since the shots with a profile of instantaneous rise and exponential decay can only account for a power - law index @xmath1 , a distribution of lifetimes are often required to explain the slower drop - off . then",
    ", a mechanism would be required to filter out shots with long or short lifetimes outside of the desired range , in order to model one observed psd ; a different range would be needed to model a different psd , to an extreme that in some cases ( e.g , cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997c ) only shots with one particular lifetime would survive the filtering process .",
    "this illustrates the ad - hoc nature of the models .",
    "interesting suggestions have been made on the nature of shot - filtering mechanisms , such as a possible application of self - organized criticality ( takeuchi et al .",
    "1995 ) , but little physics has so far been included along this line of research .",
    "other models employing different statistical techniques of analyzing stochastic time series suffer from similar drawbacks ( e.g. , pottschmidt et al .",
    "progress has also been made recently on shot - production mechanisms ( mantomo et al .",
    "1998 ) , in the context of `` advection - dominated accretion flow '' models ( e.g , narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "since the 1/f noise is ubiquitous in nature , it should not be surprising to see it in the process of mass accretion . for bhcs",
    ", the noise appears to be associated with the accretion disk , because it strengthens as the _ disk _ accretion rate increases ( i.e. , the high state is approached ; cui et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b , 1997c ) .",
    "one model suggests that the low - frequency 1/f noise in bhcs might be attributed to the fluctuation in mass accretion rate caused by the fluctuation in local viscosity in the outer portion of the disk ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for bhcs in a luminous state ,",
    "the accretion disk is likely to extend very close to the central black hole ( tanaka & lewin 1995 and references therein ) , where dynamical time scales are very short .",
    "thermodynamic fluctuation in accretion flows in the inner region of the disk could , therefore , manifests itself in the form of white noise within limited frequency bands covered by current instrumentation ( cui et al .",
    "the disk - origin of white noise seems to be supported by the observed anti - correlation between the relative strength of white noise and the accretion rate through the disk ( belloni & hasinger 1990 ; also see discussion in   2.2 ) .",
    "the power spectral break can then be naturally attributed to the `` low - pass filtering '' effects of comptonization processes , using an analogy in electronics , as soft ( disk ) photons being upscattered by energetic electrons in the surroundings to produce the observed hard power - law tail ( cui et al .",
    "in the context of this model , the cutoff frequency is determined by the characteristic escape time of soft photons from the comptonizing region , and thus provides a measure of the size of such region ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ; kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) . for cyg x-1",
    ", the model would imply that , in the context of thermal comptonization models , the hot electron corona is much smaller in the high state than in the low state , because of the much larger cutoff frequency in the high state ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ) , which is consistent with the smaller hard lags ( cui et al .",
    "1997c ) and softer energy spectrum in the high state , if both can also be attributed to comptonization processes . a smaller corona in the high state makes physical sense , because compton cooling power is expected to increase in this state , due to an increase in the supply of soft seed photons ( from the disk ) .",
    "despite early doubts from miyamoto et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , the comptonization process is still a viable and likely mechanism to account for hard lags in bhcs .",
    "it has been realized that the frequency - dependence of the lags can be attributed to the non - uniformity of the comptonizing region ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ; bttcher & liang 1998 ) .",
    "this model has been _ quantitatively _ applied to bhcs , and the agreement with data can be quite good ( hua et al .",
    "1999 ) . as an example , while the observed x - ray spectrum of cyg x-1 in the high state can be fit nearly equally well by models assuming three different density profiles ( uniform , @xmath10r , and @xmath11 ) for the comptonizing corona , which shows the degeneracy intrinsic to usual spectral analyses , the observed frequency - dependence of the hard lags can be fit only by assuming the @xmath12 density profile ( hua et al .",
    "to my best knowledge , this study represents the first attempt to _ simultaneously _ model the spectral and temporal properties of a bhc .",
    "the main drawback of such models is the requirement of maintaining a high temperature ( @xmath8100 kev ) throughout a large corona ( roughly one light second across ) .",
    "it is not clear at present whether such conditions can be satisfied physically .",
    "also proposed is the possibility that the hard lags are associated with the frequency - dependent propagation times of some waves from the soft x - ray emitting region to the hard x - ray emitting region ( miyamoto et al .",
    "while the physical nature of such waves are not known , kato ( 1989 ) suggested that low - frequency corrugation waves in a thin accretion disk might be a possibility .",
    "however , it seems nearly impossible for such models to account for the lags associated with very high - energy photons ( e.g. , grove et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this difficulty can be alleviated by noting that the inner portion of the thin disk may be `` evaporated '' to form a geometrically thick , optically thin hot `` corona '' ( see , e.g , narayan & yi 1995 ) , which can produce high - energy photons via inverse comptonization .",
    "however , in order to explain large lags at low frequencies , the required propagation speed seems too small to be attainable in the context of these models ( nowak et al .",
    "1998b ) ; neither is it clear whether near perfect coherence can be preserved by the superposition of randomly - phased waves .      while it is clear that qpos constitute a heterogeneous class of phenomena , their origins are hardly known .",
    "often , qpos are attributed to processes in the accretion disk , but evidence for such a disk origin is scarce and inconclusive . in some cases ( cui et al .",
    "1997c ) , the properties of qpos seem to correlate much better with those of hard x - rays ( perhaps of a comptonizing corona ) than those of soft x - rays ( perhaps of a disk ) .",
    "it is , therefore , certainly premature to think of qpos as signatures for accretion disks . with these in mind",
    ", i will list ( by no means exhaustively ) in the following some of the ideas that have been proposed over the years ( see also review by van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "although the low - frequency qpos ( @xmath13 100 hz ) are too slow to be associated with the keplerian motion of x - ray emitting `` blobs '' in the inner portion of an accretion disk , they might be caused by some obscuring structures in the outer part of the disk ( ebisawa et al .",
    "we would then expect to see absorption dips in x - ray light curves that are associated with the qpos ( in practice , only for very low - frequency qpos ) . while we do see intensity dips , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] , the dips do not always have a harder x - ray spectrum ( due to absorption ) compared to the non - dip emission ( e.g. , greiner et al .",
    "in fact , some of the dips in grs 1915 + 105 are thought to be related to the ejection of matter from the disk due to thermal - viscous instabilities ( belloni et al .",
    "alternatively , the low - frequency qpos might be related to certain oscillation modes of long wavelength in the accretion disk ( kato 1990 ) .",
    "again , the spectral properties need to be taken into account to assess the applicability of such models .",
    "the high - frequency qpos , such as the stable qpos in grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 , can conceivably be associated with the keplarian motion at the last stable orbit around central black holes ( morgan et al .",
    "1997 ) , but at least for gro j1655 - 40 , such an interpretation is incompatible with the observed spectral properties ( cui et al .",
    "a proposal has been made to associate the stable qpos to epicyclic oscillation modes ( nowak et al .",
    "1997 ) . not only can such modes be supported by accretion disks , they also become trapped in the innermost portion of the disk , purely due to relativistic effects ( kato & fukue 1980 ; nowak & wagoner 1992 , 1993 ; perez et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it has also been realized that g - mode oscillations affect the largest area of a region in the disk where most x - rays are emitted and are , therefore , perhaps most relevant to observations ( nowak et al .",
    "this model can explain the observed 67-hz qpo in grs 1915 + 105 and 300 hz qpo in gro j1655 - 40 , but does not seem to be consistent with the spectral properties either , at least for grs 1915 + 105 ( cui et al .",
    "also proposed is that the stable qpos might originate in the gravitomagnetic precession of accretion disks surrounding spinning black holes in microquasars ( cui et al .",
    "1998a ) . from such a model , solutions",
    "have been derived to the spin of black holes in microquasars that are also consistent with the spectral properties ( cui et al .",
    "finally , the high - frequency qpos might also be attributed to an inertial - acoustic instability in the disk ( chen & taam 1995 ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of these models is beyond the scope of this review , and will be given elsewhere ( cui et al .",
    ".    certain qpos might be the observational manifestation of the oscillatory nature of comptonizing regions ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ; kazanas et al . 1997",
    "; titarchuk et al . 1998 ) .",
    "evidence lies in the correlation between the properties of qpos and those of hard x - ray emission for some cases ( e.g , cui et al .",
    "the oscillations might be shock - induced , and comptonization processes simply take place in the post - shock region ( titarchuk et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the very high state ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is thought to be near the eddington limit , so radiation drag might play a critical role in gas dynamics around central black holes .",
    "the qpos observed in this state appear to be relatively stable in frequency ( van der klis 1995 ) , similar to the normal - branch qpos for z sources , so they might also be caused by radiative - driven oscillations in a quasi - spherical accretion flow ( fortner et al . 1989 ) .",
    "most qpos are transient events , as already mentioned .",
    "the ever - improving quality of observational data has begun to allow us to quantify the conditions in which qpos are observed .",
    "such information might shed more light on the origin(s ) of qpos . unfortunately , none of the above mentioned models are very explicit or quantitative about actual x - ray modulation processes or excitation and damping mechanisms for oscillation or precession modes , although some makes definitive predictions on the fundamental frequency of interest .",
    "more work is clearly required to make progress on this subject .",
    "clearly , our knowledge about x - ray variability in bhcs is still severely limited by the lack of high - quality data , which is partly due to the transient nature of many phenomena of interest . a concerted effort among observers is urgently needed to present a complete , uniform set of _ reliable _ results , which would include such basic properties as light curves in different energy bands , auto- and cross - correlation functions , psd , hard time lags and coherence functions as a function of fourier frequency , and so on , for any particular bhc at different x - ray fluxes ( i.e. , mass accretion rates ) or in various spectral states .",
    "not only would such results allow detailed studies of the temporal properties and their dependence on photon energy and mass accretion rate for individual sources , they would also form a valuable database for carrying out systematic investigations of bhcs as a class , from which statistically significant conclusions can be drawn on the common properties and ultimately shed light on the origins of phenomena like broad - band noise processes and qpos .",
    "too often , only a small subset of temporal properties are presented for a bhc , despite the fact that more sophisticated and complete analyses are warranted by the quality of data .",
    "the conclusions based such limited studies can be quite biased .",
    "for example , there is simply not sufficient evidence to support the disk origin of _ all _ qpos .",
    "progress can be made by correlating qpo properties with the characteristics of accretion disks ( i.e. , soft x - rays ) and comptonizing coronae ( i.e. , hard x - rays ) .",
    "better statistics is also imperative for us to gain confidence in some of the correlations that have been presented in this review .",
    "as the quality of data is ever improving , thanks to dedicated x - ray missions like rxte , more emphasis should also be made on the _ reliability _ of results .",
    "this will almost certainly require significant effort to learn about the instruments with which data are taken and to understand such important instrumental effects as dead time .",
    "for instance , as discussed in   2.1 ,",
    "the shortest time scale on which significant x - ray variability can be detected in an observation depends critically on our ability to estimate the poisson noise level , besides other obvious factors such as the statistical quality of the data .",
    "the estimation must take into account effects of dead time , which are usually poorly understood . however , uncertainty can usually be estimated based on simulations or comparison between the model and real data .",
    "the uncertainty should always kept in mind when results are presented . also helpful",
    "is the presentation of enough information so that others can evaluate the results objectively .      with the accumulation of high - quality data",
    ", theoretical effort should be focused more on modeling the observed temporal x - ray properties in bhcs .",
    "desperately needed are detail models , like the non - uniform corona model ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ) , that make _ definitive _ predictions about the properties of x - ray variability .",
    "quantities , such as light curves , auto- and cross - correlation functions , psd , hard lags , and coherence functions , can then be computed from the model and be directly compared to data , similar to techniques in modeling spectral properties .",
    "models will be accepted or rejected based on the goodness of the fit .",
    "good models can then provide quantitative information on x - ray production processes and environment ( e.g. , hua et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "although certain points are worth debating , the non - uniform corona model ( kazanas et al . 1997 ) represents the first attempt to describe , in a quantitative way , the observed temporal properties in bhcs . not only",
    "has it overcome some of the difficulties with earlier comptonization models for bhcs ( as discussed in ",
    "2.4 ) , it also sheds light on the dynamics of mass accretion in these sources ( kazanas et al .",
    "1997 ; hua et al .",
    "1998 ) . also attempted , for the first time , was to fit the observed spectral and temporal x - ray properties of cyg x-1 in the high state _ simultaneously _ with this model ( hua et al .",
    "although it was still only an eyeball fit , it was the first step in the right direction . because of the degeneracy intrinsic to usual spectral analyses , simultaneous spectral and temporal modeling represents the ultimate approach to studying mass accretion processes in bhcs .",
