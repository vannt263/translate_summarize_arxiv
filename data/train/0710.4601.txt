    "much evidence shows that primordial binaries make an important contribution to blue stragglers ( bss ) @xcite . at present , a few bss , i.e. f190 , @xmath5 car , have already been confirmed to be in binaries by observations , and their formation may be interpreted by mass transfer between the components of a binary .",
    "whereas in intermediate - age and old open and globular clusters , the number of observed close binaries among well - studied bss is consistent with the hypothesis of binary coalescence . for example , mateo et al .",
    "made a comparison of the number of close binaries with the total number of bss in ngc 5466 and found that it is an acceptable claim that all non - eclipsing bss are formed as the result of mergers of the components in close binaries , though the possibility of other mechanisms to produce bss can not be ruled out due to the large uncertainties in their analysis .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of binary stellar evolution @xcite also show that binary coalescence may be an important channel to form bss in some clusters ( e.g. with an age greater than 40 myr ) .",
    "meanwhile , the arguments in theory show that w uma binaries ( low - mass contact binaries ) must eventually merge into a single star @xcite .",
    "observationally , the lack of radial velocity variations for most bss further indicates that binary coalescence may be more important than mass transfer for bs formation @xcite .",
    "fk comae stars are generally considered to be direct evidence for binary coalescence @xcite .",
    "the smallest mass ratio of components among observed w uma systems to date is about 0.06 .",
    "all of the above show that it is important to study the remnants of close binaries .",
    "however the merge process is complicated and the physics during the process is still uncertain .",
    "recently , andronov , pinsonneault & terndrup studied the mergers of close primordial binaries by employing the angular momentum loss rate inferred from the spindown of open cluster stars .",
    "their study shows that main sequence mergers can account for the observed number of single bss in m67 and that such mergers are responsible for at least one third of the bss in open clusters older than 1 gyr .",
    "the physics of mergers are limiting case treatments in the study of andronov , pinsonneault & terndrup .",
    "based on previous studies of contact binaries and some assumptions , we construct a series of merger models in this paper , to study the structure and evolution of the models and show some comparisons with observations .    case a binary evolution has been well studied by nelson & eggleton .",
    "they defined six major subtypes for the evolution ( ad , ar , as , ae , al and an ) and two rare cases ( ag and ab ) .",
    "three of the subtypes ( ad , ar , as ) lead the binary contact as both components are main  sequence stars and two cases ( ae and ag ) reach contact with one or both components having left the main sequence . as there is no description for weird objects except for two merged main  sequence stars , merger products ( except for two main - sequences stars ) are generally assumed to have terminated their evolution @xcite , i.e. they have left the main sequence and can not be recognized as bss .",
    "here we are interested in the cases of two main - sequence stars , i.e. cases as , ar and ad . if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 represent the dynamic timescale , thermal timescale and main sequence timescale of the primary ( the initial massive star,*1 ) , respectively , the following shows a simple definition of the three evolutionary cases : ad  dynamic roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , @xmath9 ; ar  rapid evolution to contact , @xmath10 ; as  slow evolution to contact , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ages at which rlof begins and the binary comes into contact , respectively . in case ad , the core of the secondary spirals in quickly and stays in the center of the merger .",
    "the merger then has a chemical composition similar to that of the primary , resembling the result of smoothed particle hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "we therefore studied just the systems in cases ar and as for this work .",
    "using the stellar evolution code devised by eggleton , which has been updated with the latest physics over the last three decades @xcite , we re - calculate the models of cases as and ar with primary masses between 0.89 and @xmath14 until the systems become contact binaries .",
    "the structures of the primaries and the compositions of the secondaries are stored to construct the merger remnants .    before the system comes into contact ,",
    "the accreting matter is assumed to be deposited onto the surface of the secondary with zero falling velocity and distributed homogeneously all over the outer layers .",
    "the change of chemical composition on the secondary s surface caused by the accreting matter is @xmath15 \\cdot ( x_{i{\\rm a}}-x_{i{\\rm s}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are element abundances of the accreting matter and of the secondary s surface for species @xmath19 , respectively , and @xmath20 is the mass of the outermost layer of the secondary . the value of @xmath20 will change with the moving of the non - lagrangian mesh as well as the chosen model resolution , but it is so small ( @xmath21 ) in comparison with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) during rlof that we may ignore the effect of various @xmath20 on element abundances . before and after rlof , we get @xmath24 from the equation , which is reasonable in the absence of mixing @xcite .",
    "the merger models are constructed based on the following assumptions : ( i ) contact binaries with two main - sequence components coalesce finally and the changes of structures of individual components during coalescence are ignored ; ( ii ) the matter of the secondary is homogeneously mixed with that of the primary beyond the core - envelope transition point , which separates the core and the envelope of the mass donor ; ( iii ) the system mass is conserved .",
    "firstly , we present a brief discussion on these assumptions .",
    "webbink studied the evolutionary fate of low - mass contact binaries , and found that a system can not sustain its binary character beyond the limits set by marginal contact evolution ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "he stated that a contact binary will very likely coalesce as the primary is still on the main sequence in a real system .",
    "up to now , it is widely believed that case ad probably leads to common envelope , spiral - in , and coalescence on quite a short timescale .",
    "the final consequences of as and ar are not very clear , but eggleton pointed out that systems undergoing ar or as evolution may maintain a shallow contact ( perhaps intermittently ) as the mass ratio becomes more extreme , and finally coalesce .",
    "recent study on w uma ( li , zhang & han , 2005 ) also shows that these systems will be eventually coalescence .",
    "the merged timescale , i.e. the time from a binary contact to coalescence , is important here .",
    "if it is too long , the structures of both components will change remarkably and the system may have not completed coalescence within the cluster age .",
    "there are many * conflicting estimates * for the timescale , however , from observations and theoretical models of the merger process . *",
    "early observational estimates range from * @xmath26@xmath27 yr in various environments @xcite .",
    "the following study explored the average age about @xmath28 yr @xcite .",
    "bilir et al .",
    "pointed out that the age difference between field contact binaries and chromospherically active binaries , 1.61 gyr , is likely an upper limit for the contact stage by assuming an equilibrium in the galaxy , whereas the study of w uma by li , han & zhang suggested a much longer timescale , about 7 gyr .",
    "we adopt the empirically estimated values in this paper * ( i.e from @xmath29 to @xmath30 yrs ) * and ignore the changes of structure of individual components during merger process . for low - mass contact binaries ,",
    "the common envelope is convective @xcite , and the matter in it is thus homogeneous . if a system mimics shallow contact during coalescence , it is reasonable to assume that the matter of the secondary mixes with the envelope homogeneously . vant",
    "veer found that the mass loss from the system during coalescence is at a rate of about @xmath31 by observations . if we consider that the coalescence time is @xmath28 yr in a binary , only @xmath32 is lost from the system as the binary finally becomes a single star .",
    "we then roughly assume that the mass is conservative during coalescence .",
    "however mass loss might be an important way to carry orbital angular momentum away from the binary in this process .",
    "secondly , we discuss the choice of the core - envelope transition point which separates the core and the envelope in the primary .",
    "many characteristics of the merger are relevant to the choice , e.g. the chemical composition in the envelope , evolutionary track on hertzsprung - russel diagram , and some observational characteristics .",
    "unfortunately , one can not find the core - envelope transition point in a main - sequence star as easily as in evolved stars because the density profile , as well as many other thermodynamic quantities ( entropy , pressure , temperature etc . ) , is smooth and does not have a deep gradient for main - sequence stars .",
    "chen & han studied the influences of core - envelope transition point on the mergers of contact binaries with two main - sequence components .",
    "they found that one may ignore the effects which result from different choices of the transition point on colours and magnitudes of the merger if it is outside the nuclear reaction region of the primary , which is commonly considered as the nearest boundary of the secondary reaches in cases as and ar . in this paper , the core - envelope transition is determined as the point within which the core produces 99 per cent of total luminosity .",
    "this choice is generally outside the nuclear reaction regions and has little effect on the final results .",
    "finally the merger remnant is constructed as follows : it has the total mass of the system and a chemical composition within @xmath33 similar to the core of the primary .",
    "the chemical composition in the envelope of the merger is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the total masses of species @xmath19 of the secondary and of the primary s envelope , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the envelope mass of the primary .",
    "there might be a region in which the helium abundance is less than that of the outer region .",
    "the matter in this region then has a lower mean molecular weight than that in the outer region .",
    "this results in secular instability and thermohaline mixing @xcite .",
    "we include it as a diffusion process in our code @xcite .    in the models of nelson & eggleton ,",
    "both total mass and angular momentum are conservative .",
    "it was mentioned by the authors , however , that these assumptions were only reasonable for a restricted range of intermediate masses , i.e spectra from about g0 to b1 and luminosity class iii - v .",
    "observationally , some low mass binaries with late - type components show clear signs of magnetic activity , which indicates that the systems evolve by way of a scenario implying angular momentum loss ( aml ) by magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "magnetized stellar winds probably do not carry off much mass , but they are rich in angular momentum because of magnetic linkage to the binaries . for close binaries",
    ", rotation is expected to synchronize with orbital period , so aml is at the expense of the orbital angular momentum , resulting in orbital decaying and the components approaching each other . a detached binaries ,",
    "then , may become contact and finally coalesce at or before the cluster age @xcite .",
    "there are a number of subjects including the treatment of aml @xcite . for simplicity , the conservative assumption is also adopted in our binary evolutions . in old clusters , however , aml of low mass binaries is very important and * we estimate its importance in another way ( see section 4.2 ) . *",
    "a set of binaries undergoing as and ar evolution from nelson & eggleton are choosen to study the characteristics of the merger products and their connections with blue stragglers .",
    "table a1 gives the initial parameters of the binary systems , their rlof information and the structures and evolutionary consequences of the mergers .",
    "the first three columns contain the initial mass of the primary @xmath38 , the initial mass ratio @xmath39 ( the primary to the secondary ) and the initial orbital period @xmath40 in logarithmic , where @xmath41 is given by ( nelson & eggleton , 2001 ) @xmath42 the fourth and fifth columns are the ages at which roche lobe overflow begins ( @xmath12 ) and the binary comes into contact ( @xmath13 ) in our calculation .",
    "the next three columns show some system parameters at @xmath13 , i.e. the mass of the primary @xmath43 , the mass of the secondary @xmath44 and the orbital period @xmath45 .",
    "the remaining columns present the evolutionary results of the mergers : the lifetime on the main sequence ( @xmath8 ) , the central hydrogen mass fraction of the merger as constructed ( @xmath46 ) and after adjustment ( @xmath47 ) , surface abundances for the elements h ( @xmath48 ) , he ( @xmath49 ) and the ratio of c / n at the surface ( @xmath50 ) .    figure .",
    "[ cmd ] shows the location of the mergers on a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) when the central hydrogen mass fraction reaches its maximum , at which we consider that the merger returns to thermal equilibrium and begins normal evolution . in a real case ,",
    "the thermal equilibrium point of the constructed models are probably not just at the maximum of central hydrogen mass , but the divergence should be very small and have no influence on the results . ` . ' and ` @xmath51 ' in the figure represent the mergers from as and ar , respectively .",
    "open circles show the possible bss produced from our models in an old open cluster m67 and the dashed one shows zero - age main sequence ( zams ) for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is metallicity and @xmath54 is helium content . in figure [ cmd ]",
    "we see that most of the mergers are located in the main sequence while a few are to the left of zams .",
    "surface chemical composition and central hydrogen content are both responsible for placing objects to the left of zams .",
    "generally the mergers have a larger helium content than 0.28 because the matter from the secondary , including some helium - rich matter produced via nuclear reaction , homogeneously mixes in the envelope of the primary .",
    "they are thus bluer than stars of the same mass and of the same central hydrogen mass fraction with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the mergers may be on the left of zams if central h contents close to 0.7 , initial h mass fraction for pop i.    sandquist , bolte & hernquist argued that a fainter bs should have a less massive progenitor , and therefore has a lower helium content in the core .",
    "this means that bss should spend an increasing amount of time near the zams with decreasing mass , which will lead to a definite concentration toward the blue side of the main sequence in the region of low mass bss . in fig .",
    "[ xhd ] we present the distribution of central hydrogen mass fraction at its maximum @xmath47 with the mass of the merger .",
    "no evidence in the figure shows that lower mass mergers should have higher hydrogen mass fractions in the center ( say , more close to zams ) . in our models , there are at least two factors affecting the central hydrogen mass fraction of a merger , i.e. the evolutionary degree of the parent stars when the system comes into contact and the development of the central convective region of the merger before normal evolution .",
    "the former is relevant to the mass of the progenitor and their contact ages .",
    "if we simply assume that all bss in a cluster are formed at a same time ( which is obviously not true ) , larger ( more massive ) progenitors have less hydrogen content in the center , but their mergers may develop larger convective regions in the centers , involving more of the h - rich matter from around the nuclear region of the primary in the center of the merger . as a consequence , the enhancement of central hydrogen content might be comparable to , or larger than , the less massive mergers .",
    "on the other hand , if a fainter bs is produced earlier than a brighter one  the formation time of a bs is strongly dependent on some other system s initial parameters as well as its progenitors mass .",
    "the fainter bs has then evolved for a relatively longer time and may have less hydrogen in the center than the larger one .",
    "therefore the blue concentration with mass decreasing predicted by sandquist , bolte & hernquist may be not true in a real case .",
    "in fact , we have not found the concentration observationally , whereas there is a certain width of bss sequence .",
    "we obtained some models with very little central hydrogen content , i.e @xmath47 very close to zero . seen in fig .",
    "[ xhd ] , all these objects are from the as channel",
    ". long - time rlofs of their progenitors lead the primaries be near the termination of main sequence when the systems being contact .",
    "detailed calculations for these mergers show that their main - sequence timescales are in order of @xmath27 yrs .",
    "such unusually long lifetimes are relevant to the development of central convective core .",
    "* comparison to the primaries of the progenitors , the products have higher masses and will develop larger convective core masses in the following evolutions , leading central hydrogen increase . on the other hand , nuclear reactions will consume some hydrogen in the core .",
    "the maximum of central hydrogen mass fraction is the equibibrium point at which the hydrogen involved in the core is comparable to that exhausted by nuclear reactions .",
    "after that , the consumed hydrogen is more than that involved in the core , but the growth of convective core adds fresh fuels and extends the lifetime in this phase . * for a @xmath55 star with a stable convective core , it is just about @xmath56 yr when hydrogen mass fraction ranges from 0.005 to 0.0000 , while about @xmath27 yr in these models .    we should pay more attention to the mergers with little central hydrogen content .",
    "the triangles in figure 1 show the positions of these objects . from table a1",
    ", we see that the primaries are very close to the exhausted of hydrogen .",
    "so it is very likely that the primaries have left the main sequence as eventually coalescence , and the mergers are subgiants and much redder than that shown in fig .",
    "meanwhile , the development of convective core and the merger process are probably synchronous .",
    "after coalescence , the convective core develops more quickly than that in our models .",
    "sandquist , bolte & hernquist once suggested that low - mass bss ( near the turnoff of a cluster ) in m67 might be subgiant stars and a very small central hydrogen content in these objects may remarkably shorten their ms lifetimes and increase the chance of them being in the subgiant region .",
    "this may explain the observed spread in colour of low - mass bss .",
    "these mergers with little central hydrogen in our models are similar to the objects mentioned by sandquist , bolte & hernquist , but they may be up to @xmath57 , not just staying in the region around the turnoff in m67 .",
    "figures.[mv ] and [ bv ] show how the magnitude in the v band , @xmath58 , and the colour , @xmath3 , change with the merger mass @xmath59 at @xmath47 .",

    "the latter has not been exactly expressed in our models , and therefore we just see that the mergers from a long @xmath74 have larger luminosities as shown in section 4 . *    * in our binary evolutions , we have not included aml , which exists in low - mass binaries and may be the main course making the binaries change from detached to contact and finally coalesce , resulting in a large contribution to bss in old clusters , e.g ngc 2682 . in young and intermediate - age clusters , however , aml has little contribution to the birthrate of bss , since ( a ) the time is not long enough for binaries to go from detached to contact and ( b ) the mass of the mergers is probably less than the turnoff of the cluster even though their parents may coalesce in the cluster age .",
    "so , we simply estimated the effect of aml in ngc 2682 while negecting it in ngc 2660 .",
    "*    the mass loss during the merger process can also affect our result , mainly the location on the cmd of the products .",
    "as shown in ngc 2660 , no bss have been observed in the region with the most opportunity from our models .",
    "because of mass loss , the mergers will be fainter than those given in the paper .",
    "however the faintness will be slight since the mass loss is not vast from both observations and smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the lost mass may carry some angular momentum out from the parent binary . by analyzing the bs spectra from hubble space telescope (",
    "there is an apparent continuum deficit on the short - wavelength side of balmer discontinuity ) , de marco et al .",
    "argued that some bss might be surrounded by a circumstellar disk .",
    "however , porter & townsend showed that the flux deficits may be attributed wholly to rapid rotation .",
    "the rotation rates needed are of the order of those found in the study of de macro et al . .",
    "whether the flux deficits shortward of the balmer jump are induced by a circumstellar disk or rapid rotation , it provides a possible explanation for the orbital angular momentum of the system after coalescence .",
    "such a large mass loss as shown in ngc 2660 ( about @xmath109 ) , however , is a problem and should be explained reasonably in physics .    based on some assumptions",
    ", we studied the mergers of close binaries from as and ar evolution by detailed evolutionary calculations .",
    "the products from our models may stay on the left of the zams and have no central concentration with decreasing mass . because of the * development * of the convective core , the mergers with little central hydrogen ( less than 0.01 ) in our models have unusually long timescales on the main sequence ( @xmath110 yrs ) .",
    "these objects are probably subgiants as they are formed , since the primaries in the progenitors also have little central hydrogen and may have left the main sequence during merger process .",
    "the mergers from our models stay on the main sequence for a timescale in order of @xmath27 yrs .",
    "some low - mass mergers may stay on the ms for about @xmath107 yrs .",
    "the timescale is similar to that of w uma stars from observations , and therefore we may roughly estimate the contribution to bss from as and ar via the number of w uma systems in a cluster . the estimation , however , is not absolutely since both of the two timescales have wide ranges and large uncertainties , and we can not rule out other methods for creating w uma systems except for as and ar . comparison to observations indicates that our models ( binary coalescence from as and ar ) are not important for the produce of bss in old open clusters , while likely play a critical role in some younger open clusters .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to examine our models in an old open cluster ngc 2682 and in an intermediate - age cluster ngc 2660 .",
    "the effect of aml was estimated in ngc 2682 in a simple way , where the mergers are replaced with zams models . in ngc 2682 ,",
    "binary mergers from our models cover the region with high luminosity and those from aml are located in the region with low luminosity , existing a certain width .",
    "the bss from aml are much more than those from our models , indicating that aml of low mass binaries makes a major contribution to bss in this cluster .",
    "our models are corresponding for several bss in ngc 2660 .",
    "in the region with the most opportunity on cmd , however , no bss have been observed . *",
    "our results are well - matched to the observations if there are @xmath4 of mass loss in the merger process , but a physical mechanism for this much mass loss is a problem . *",
