    "each of the large interferometric gravitational wave detectors that are now under construction  ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo  @xcite , tama  @xcite ) will produce a flood of data when they come online in a few years .",
    "apart from the `` main '' data channel carrying measurement of strain in the arm lengths , there will be a few hundred auxiliary channels  @xcite at each site associated with system and environmental monitors , such as seismometers and magnetometers .",
    "their role would be to monitor the state of the detector and its environment so that any unusual event in the main channel or an unexpected behavior of the detector can be diagnosed properly .",
    "( the sum total of raw data from the ligo detectors will be produced at the rate of @xmath0 megabytes  @xcite every second . )    under ideal conditions , each data channel would carry stationary noise . for the main channel , this would reflect a steady state of the interferometer and for the auxiliary channels , a steady state of the environment .",
    "however , experience with prototypes as well as with the several resonant mass detectors that have been operating for quite some time shows that this situation does not hold in reality .",
    "there will always be episodes of non - stationarity though their rates and durations will depend on the choice of the detector site and other factors .",
    "detecting non - stationarity is important both in the main channel , because some non - stationarity could be of astrophysical origin , and also in the auxiliary channels where it can be an important diagnostic of the instrument or its environment .",
    "it is also important when estimating a statistical model of the detector noise where it is essential that the data segment used be stationary .",
    "[ the deleterious effects of non - stationarity on power spectral density  ( psd ) estimation were noted in  @xcite . ]    several methods for detecting non - stationarity that are relevant in this context have already been considered in the gravitational wave data analysis literature  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods share an unsatisfactory feature which is that the computation of the detection threshold corresponding to a specified _ false alarm rate _ requires an _ a priori _ knowledge of a statistical model of the stationary ambient noise .",
    "an error in the model leads to an error in our knowledge of the false alarm rate . in the real world such prior models are usually not available and it is necessary to estimate noise models from the data itself . even if a model exists , it will almost always have some free parameters ( the variance being a trivial example ) whose values would have to be estimated from the data fairly regularly , especially in the case of a complicated instrument such as a laser interferometer or its environment monitors .",
    "thus , when confronted with an uncharacterized dataset , an experimenter who is only limited to methods such as the above can face considerable uncertainty in fixing a threshold for the test before analyzing the data . for a sufficiently small dataset ,",
    "the analyst can start with _",
    "ad hoc _ thresholds and work in some iterative sense towards a statistically satisfactory conclusion .",
    "the problem becomes more serious when the data set to be analyzed is so large that it becomes necessary to substantially automate the analysis , as would most certainly be needed in the case of the large interferometers .",
    "an additional set of problems will arise when analyzing auxiliary channels since ambient terrestrial noise may be intrinsically more difficult to characterize and have a variable nature .",
    "we introduce here , in the context of gravitational wave data analysis , a test for detecting non - stationarity for which the issue of fixing the correct threshold is trivial by design .",
    "the false alarm rate for such a _ robust _ test depends weakly on the statistics of the ambient noise and is specified almost completely by the detection threshold alone . in the present paper we concentrate on short duration non - stationarity or _",
    "bursts _ since they are likely to be the most common types of non - stationarity in gravitational wave detectors .",
    "we find that the robustness of the test improves for smaller false alarm rates , which is precisely the regime of interest .",
    "if required , the test can be optimized in terms of the duration of the bursts that need to be detected .",
    "we compare the efficiency of this test in detecting narrowband bursts with that of an ideal test which requires both a noise model and prior knowledge of the frequency band  ( center frequency and bandwidth ) in which the bursts occur .",
    "we find that supplementing our test with an approximate prior knowledge of the burst duration allows it to detect , at the same false alarm rate and detection probability , bursts with a peak amplitude that is a factor of @xmath1 larger than that of the bursts which the ideal test can detect .    apart from being robust",
    ", it also has the following properties that make it useful as an online monitor of stationarity .",
    "the computational cost associated with this test is quite small .",
    "areas of non - stationarity are clearly distinguished , in the time - frequency plane , from areas of stationarity . apart from making the output simple to understand visually",
    ", this will allow an automated routine to catalogue burst information such as the time of occurrence and frequency band .",
    "the detection of non - stationarity has been actively studied in statistics for quite some time  @xcite and numerous tests suitable for a wide variety of non - stationary effects exist in the literature .",
    "the central idea behind our test is the detection of statistically significant _ changes _ in the psd . as a means of detecting non - stationarity ,",
    "this idea is quite natural and has been proposed in several earlier works .",
    "( see , for instance,@xcite . )",
    "though what constitutes a change and how it is measured can be defined in many different ways leading to tests that differ statistically as well as computationally . the specific implementation presented in this paper leads to a statistically robust test .",
    "the issue of robust tests for non - stationarity , though important as we have argued , has not been considered in gravitational wave detection so far .",
    "the same concerns as well as a more rigorous treatment exist in the statistical literature  @xcite .",
    "our present work was , however , done independently and this test is a new contribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec1 ] we formally state the problem addressed in this paper .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] describes the student _",
    "t_-test which lies at the core of our test .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the basic ideas that lead to the test and why the test can be expected to be robust . in section",
    "[ sec3 ] , the test is characterized statistically in term of its false alarm rate and detection power .",
    "the main results of this paper are also presented in this section .",
    "the computational cost associated with this test is discussed in section  [ sec3_4 ] .",
    "this is followed by our conclusions and pointers to future work in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "a random process @xmath2 is said to be _ strictly stationary _",
    "@xcite if the joint probability density @xmath3 of any finite number , @xmath4 , of samples is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "often , one uses a less restrictive definition called _ wide sense stationarity _ which demands only that the mean @xmath6 $ ] and the autocovariance @xmath7 ) ( x(t_i+\\tau ) -{\\rm e}[x(t_i+\\tau)])]$ ] be independent of @xmath5 .",
    "a random process not satisfying any of the above definitions is called _ non - stationary_.    we assume that the ambient noise in the data channel of interest is wide sense stationary over sufficiently long time scales and a burst is an episode of non - stationarity with a much smaller duration .",
    "that is , the occurrence of a burst lasting from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in a segment @xmath2 of data ( @xmath10 ) means that @xmath11 where @xmath12 . in practice ,",
    "time series _ @xmath13 consisting of regularly spaced samples of @xmath2 is available instead of @xmath2 itself . thus , given the time series @xmath13 , we want to decide between the following two hypotheses about @xmath13 :    1 .",
    "_ null hypothesis _ @xmath14 : @xmath13 is obtained from a wide sense stationary random process .",
    "alternative hypothesis _",
    "@xmath15 : @xmath13 is obtained from a non - stationary random process .    the _ frequentist approach _",
    "@xcite to this decision problem , which is followed here , begins by constructing a function @xmath16 , called a _ test statistic _ , of the data @xmath13 . if the data @xmath13 is such that @xmath17 , for some threshold @xmath18 , the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis for that @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath13 is obtained from a random process , there exists a finite probability , that @xmath16 crosses the threshold even when the data is stationary .",
    "such an event is called a _",
    "false alarm _ and the rate of such events over a sequence of data @xmath13 is called the _ false alarm rate_. the threshold @xmath18 is determined by specifying the false alarm rate that the analyst is willing to tolerate .    to compute the threshold , we need to know the distribution function of @xmath16 when @xmath14 is true .",
    "this distribution can , in principle , be obtained if the joint distribution of @xmath13  ( i.e. , a noise model ) is known . however , as mentioned in the introduction , such prior knowledge is usually incomplete , if it exists at all , in the real world .",
    "the only solution then is to estimate the joint distribution from the data itself .",
    "therefore , one must first find a stationary segment of the data , by detecting and then rejecting non - stationary parts , but that brings us back to our primary objective itself !    to get around this paradox ,",
    "we must _ construct _",
    "@xmath16 such that its distribution is as independent as possible of the distribution of the data under the null hypothesis .",
    "if the distribution of the test statistic is strictly independent of the distribution of @xmath13 , the test is called  @xcite _ non - parametric_. if the test statistic distribution depends on the distribution of @xmath13 but only _ weakly _ , the test is said to be a _",
    "robust _ test .",
    "tests which do not have either of these properties are called _",
    "parametric_. formally , therefore , the aim of this work is to find a non - parametric , or at least a robust test , for non - stationarity .",
    "before we describe our test for non - stationarity , it is best to discuss student s _",
    "t_-test  @xcite in some detail since this standard statistical test plays an important role in what follows .",
    "student s _",
    "t_-test is designed to address the following problem .",
    "given a set of @xmath20 samples , @xmath21 , drawn from a gaussian distribution of unknown mean and variance , how do we check that the mean @xmath22 of the distribution is non - zero ? in student s",
    "_ t_-test , a test statistic @xmath19 is constructed , @xmath23 where @xmath24 the distribution of @xmath19 is known  @xcite , both when @xmath25 and @xmath26 . to check whether @xmath27 ,",
    "a two - sided threshold is set on _",
    "t _ corresponding to a specified false alarm probability . if _",
    "t _ crosses the threshold on either side , the null hypothesis @xmath25 is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis @xmath26 .    of interest to us here",
    "are two main properties of the _ t_-test .",
    "first , if two sets of independent samples @xmath28 and @xmath29 are drawn from gaussian distributions with the same but unknown variances , the _",
    "t_-test can be employed to check whether the means of the two distributions are equal or not .",
    "this can be done simply by constructing a third set of samples @xmath30 , which would again be gaussian distributed , and then testing , as shown above , whether the mean of the distribution from which @xmath31 is drawn is non - zero or not .",
    "the second important property  @xcite of the _ t_-test is its _ robustness _ : as long as the underlying distributions from which the two samples are drawn are identical , but not necessarily gaussian , the distribution of the _ t _ statistic does not deviate much from the gaussian case .",
    "the lowest order corrections to the mean and variance of the distribution being @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "we present here an outline of our test .",
    "the details of the actual algorithm are presented in the appendix .    from sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , it is clear that a direct signature of non - stationarity is a change in the autocovariance function .",
    "this implies that the psd of the random process should also change since the it is the fourier transform of the autocovariance function  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the basic idea behind our test is the detection of a change in the psd of a time series .",
    "the test involves the following steps ( see fig .",
    "[ figx1 ] also ) .    1 .",
    "the time series to be analyzed is divided into adjacent but disjoint segments of equal duration @xmath34 .",
    "[ outline_step1 ] 2 .",
    "take two such disjoint data segments @xmath35 and @xmath36 separated by a time interval @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "we would like to compare the psds of these two segments and test if there is a significant difference.[outline_step2 ] 3 .",
    "subdivide each of the two segments into @xmath20 subsegments of equal duration .",
    "thus , segment @xmath39 , @xmath40 , gives us @xmath20 subsegments , each of duration @xmath41 , which we denote by @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "this is an intermediate step in the estimation of the psd of each segment @xmath39.[outline_step3 ] 4 .",
    "compute the _ periodogram _ of each @xmath44 .",
    "a periodogram is the squared modulus of the discrete fourier transform  ( dft ) of a time series  [ eq .",
    "( [ pdg ] ] .",
    "[ outline_step4 ] 5 .   for every frequency bin ,",
    "therefore , we obtain a set @xmath45 of @xmath20 numbers from @xmath35 and similarly another set @xmath46 from @xmath36 . in a conventional estimation of the psd of a segment ,",
    "say @xmath35 , we would simply average the corresponding set @xmath45 . however ,",
    "since we want to _ compare _ two psds , we do the following instead.[outline_step5 ] 6 .",
    "perform student s _",
    "t_-test for equality of mean on these two independent sets @xmath45 and @xmath46 . if the _ t _ statistic crosses a preset threshold @xmath18 , then a significant change in the mean is indicated , otherwise not .",
    "[ outline_step6 ] 7 .   repeat step  [ outline_step6 ] for all frequency bins in exactly the same manner .",
    "[ outline_step7 ]    steps  [ outline_step2 ] to  [ outline_step7 ] should then be repeated with another pair of disjoint segments @xmath47 and @xmath48 and so on .",
    "thus , the output of the test at this stage is a two dimensional image with time along one axis and frequency along the other . in this image ,",
    "every frequency bin for which the threshold @xmath18 is crossed can be thought of as being colored black while the remaining are colored white .",
    "hence , white areas in this image would indicate stationarity while the contrary would be indicated by the black areas .",
    "a sample image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "it is the result of applying the test to a simulated time series constructed by adding a broad band burst to stationary white gaussian noise ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3_1 ] for definitions ) .",
    "not all black areas would , however , correspond to non - stationarity .",
    "most of them would be random threshold crossings caused by the stationary noise itself .",
    "we search , therefore , for _ clusters _ of black pixels in the image which pass a veto that can be motivated as follows .",
    "suppose the burst is fully contained in one segment , say , @xmath35 .",
    "then one would expect the _",
    "t_-test threshold to be crossed once when comparing @xmath35 with @xmath49 and again when @xmath35 is compared with @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to a characteristic `` double bang '' structure for the cluster of black pixels .",
    "we throw away all other groups of black pixels that do not show such a feature .",
    "( this scheme is defined rigorously in the appendix . )",
    "fig  [ fig1](b ) shows the result obtained by applying this veto to the image in fig  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "one of the cluster is at the location of the added burst while the other is a false event .",
    "this test can be expected to be robust for two reasons .",
    "first , the periodogram at any frequency is asymptotically exponentially  @xcite distributed .",
    "this can be heuristically explained as follows .",
    "the dft of a time series is a linear transform .",
    "if the number of time samples in a random time series is sufficiently large , it then follows from the _ central limit theorem _ that the dft of that time series will have , at each frequency , imaginary and real parts which are distributed as gaussians .",
    "since the basis functions used in a dft are orthogonal , the real and imaginary parts also tend towards being statistically independent .",
    "this implies that , for a sufficiently large number of time samples , the periodogram , which is simply the squared modulus of the dft , is exponentially distributed at each frequency .",
    "the second reason which should make the test robust is the fact , mentioned earlier , that the _ t_-test is robust against non - gaussianity when the two samples being compared have identical distributions . under the null hypothesis of stationarity",
    ", we do indeed have identically distributed sets in our case .    since the asymptotic distribution of a periodogram is independent of the statistical distribution of the time samples , much of the information about the time domain statistical distribution",
    "is lost in the frequency domain .",
    "thus , the _",
    "t_-test `` sees '' nearly exponentially distributed samples whereas the time domain samples may have a gaussian or non - gaussian distribution .",
    "added to this , the robustness of the _",
    "t_-test also removes information about the time domain statistical distribution .",
    "further , the _",
    "t_-test checks for a _ change _ in the mean value and is insensitive to the absolute value of the mean .",
    "this is strictly true in the gaussian case but , because of the robustness of the _",
    "t_-test , it should also hold to a large extent for the exponential case .",
    "these basic considerations suggest strongly that the test as a whole should be robust .",
    "however , the test also involves some other steps beyond just a simple _ t_-test .",
    "first , the same segment is involved twice in a _",
    "t_-test  ( c.f .  sec .",
    "[ sec2_2 ] ) .",
    "thus , for any @xmath51 , samples @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the sequence of _ t _ values at a given frequency will be correlated to a large extent .",
    "second , we impose a non - trivial veto .",
    "the above features of the test , though well motivated and conceptually simple , make a straightforward analytical study of the test difficult .",
    "therefore , to establish the robust nature of the test and quantify its performance , we must follow a more empirical approach based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "an analytical treatment of the test is currently under development .",
    "our main aim in this section is to demonstrate the robust nature of the test and to study the efficacy of this test in detecting non - stationarity .",
    "since , we need to use monte carlo simulations for understanding these statistical aspects of the test , we discuss only a few selected cases in this paper .    for a test to qualify as robust",
    "the threshold should be almost completely specified by the false alarm rate without requiring any assumptions about the statistics of the data .",
    "the false alarm rate , in the context of this test , is the rate at which clusters of black pixels occur when the input to the test is a _ stationary _ data stream . to obtain the false alarm rate ,",
    "several realizations of _ stationary _ noise are generated and the test is performed on each . for a given threshold ,",
    "the number of clusters detected over all the realizations provides an estimate of the false alarm rate at that threshold .",
    "the efficacy of a test in detecting a deviation from the null hypothesis is measured by the _ detection probability _ of the deviation . in this paper , we measure the detection probability of different types of _ bursts _ that appear additively in stationary ambient noise . realizations of signals from a fixed class  ( such as narrowband or broadband bursts of noise ) are generated , to each of which we add a realization of stationary noise .",
    "the test is applied to the total data and we check whether a cluster of black pixel appears in a specified area of the time - frequency plane . this fixed area , which we call the _ detection region _ ,",
    "is specified in advance of the simulation .",
    "the ratio of the number of realizations having a cluster in the specified area to the total number of realizations gives an estimate of the detection probability for bursts of that class .",
    "the function that maps the test threshold into false alarm rate depends on the test parameters , @xmath34 , @xmath53 and @xmath54  ( c.f .",
    "[ sec2_2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for each choice of these test parameters , the test must be calibrated separately using a monte carlo simulation . however , thanks to the robust nature of the test , the simulation needs to be performed only once and for a simple noise process such as gaussian white noise which need not have any relation to the actual random process at hand .",
    "the role of the test parameters is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec3_3 ] .",
    "[ sec3_1 ] we perform a monte carlo simulation for each of the representative cases below and show that the false alarm rate , as a function of threshold , is the same for all of them .",
    "each realization of the input data is a 10  sec long time series and each simulation uses @xmath55 such realizations .",
    "we can look upon all the separate realizations of the input as forming parts of a single data stream  ( @xmath56  sec long ) and , if we assume that false alarms occur as a poisson process , the false alarm rate  ( in number of events per hour ) is given by the total number of false alarms over all realizations divided by @xmath57 .",
    "the various cases considered here are as follows .    _",
    "( i ) white gaussian noise _",
    "( @xmath58) the time series consists of independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath59 of the gaussian random variables is unity and their mean is zero .    _",
    "( ii ) white gaussian noise _",
    "( @xmath60 )  same as above but with @xmath60 .    _",
    "( iii ) white non - gaussian noise  _ all details in this simulation are the same as above except that the distribution of each sample is now chosen to be an exponential with @xmath58 .    _",
    "( iv ) colored noise  _ we generated gaussian , zero mean noise with a psd as shown in fig .",
    "the overall normalization is arbitrary but the noise is scaled in the time domain to make its variance unity .",
    "this psd was derived from the expected initial ligo psd , as provided in  @xcite , by truncating the latter below 5  hz and above 800  hz followed by the application of a band pass filter with unity gain between 50  hz and 500  hz .    the range covered by the above types of statistical models is much more extensive than would be required in practice . by applying the test to such extreme situations , we can _ bound _ the variations in the false alarm rate versus threshold curve that would occur in a more realistic situation . in considering this range of models for the stationary background noise",
    ", we have gone from a two - sided distribution to a completely one side distribution .",
    "the output from most channels would be two sided and , hence , closer to a gaussian than the exponential distribution considered here .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] . for the small false alarm rates  ( @xmath61/hour ) that will be required in practice ,",
    "the test is clearly shown to be very insensitive to the statistical nature of the data .",
    "the largest variation is between the gaussian and exponential case while there is hardly any variation , even at large false alarm rates , among the gaussian cases .",
    "the variation between the gaussian and exponential case is less than @xmath62 in the worst case . as explained above , this",
    "should be treated as an upper bound on the error one might expect in practice .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] correspond to different sets of test parameter values .",
    "the threshold for a given false alarm rate does depend , as one may expect , on the parameters of the test @xmath53 , @xmath34 and @xmath54 . because of the robust nature , however , given a particular set of parameter values only a single monte carlo simulation has to be performed with , say , white gaussian noise , in order to obtain the corresponding false alarm rate versus threshold curve .",
    "the parameter values for fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] were chosen to be the same as those that will be used in the following section .",
    "we also consider in that section the case of a band pass filtered and down sampled time series .",
    "[ fig5 ] uses parameter values appropriate to the latter while the choice for fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is explained in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec3_3 ] .",
    "a burst has an effectively finite duration and is itself an instance of a stochastic process .",
    "we consider the following combinations of background noise , bursts and test parameters @xmath34 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the sampling frequency of the data is assumed to be @xmath63  hz .",
    "the background noise is a zero mean stationary gaussian process with a psd that matches the expected initial ligo psd ( c.f .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the burst is a _ narrow band _",
    "burst constructed by band pass filtering a white gaussian noise sequence followed by multiplication of the filtered output with a time domain window .",
    "let the width of the pass band be @xmath64 and its central frequency be @xmath65 .",
    "the time domain window function is chosen to be a gaussian in shape ( @xmath66 ) where @xmath67 is chosen such that when @xmath68  sec , the window amplitude drops to 10% of its maximum value ( which is unity at @xmath69 ) .",
    "the burst has , therefore , an effective duration of @xmath70  sec .",
    "after windowing , the peak amplitude of the burst is normalized to a specified value .",
    "the test parameters are @xmath71  sec , @xmath72  sec and @xmath73 .",
    "( @xmath72  sec corresponds to 64 points , a power of 2 , in order to optimize the fast fourier transforms needed for computing the periodogram for each subsegment . )",
    "we consider two types of narrow band bursts .",
    "type ( 1 ) has @xmath74  hz , while type ( 2 ) has @xmath75  hz . @xmath76  hz for both types of bursts .",
    "the detection region , which is the area in the time frequency plane that must contain a cluster of black pixel for a valid detection , is chosen in both cases to be @xmath77  sec and @xmath78  hz wide in time and frequency respectively .",
    "it is centered at the location of the window maximum in time and at @xmath65 in frequency .    for each type of burst",
    ", we empirically determine the peak amplitude required in order for the burst to have a detection probability of @xmath79 .",
    "this is done at several different values of the detection threshold corresponding to false alarm rates of 1 false event in 1/2 , 1 , 2 , or 3 hours .",
    "the results are tabulated in table  [ tablei ] .    as shown later in sec .",
    "[ sec3_3 ] , the above choice for the test parameters , especially the value of @xmath34 , optimizes the test for detecting bursts which effectively last for @xmath70  sec .",
    "we have , therefore , presented the best performance the test can deliver for detecting bursts with this duration .",
    "note that the same set of parameters optimize the test for detecting bursts that occur in very different frequency bands .",
    "thus , the duration of a burst is effectively the only characteristic that needs to be considered when optimizing the test .",
    "this point is discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec3_3 ] .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , we show samples of both data and burst ( with the peak amplitudes given in table  [ tablei ] ) for each of the two cases described above .",
    "[ fig6 ] corresponds to type ( 1 ) bursts and illustrates the fact that the bursts being detected are not prominent enough to be picked up by `` eye '' .",
    "the burst in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , which is of type ( 2 ) , is more prominent .",
    "this is because these bursts lie closer in frequency to the `` seismic wall '' part of the noise curve  ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) where the variance of the psd is higher .    to better understand the detection efficiency of our test",
    ", it is natural to ask for a comparison with a test that , intuitively , represents the best we can do .",
    "let us suppose that we know _ a priori _ that all bursts are of type  ( 2 ) above and that the ambient noise is a gaussian , stationary random process .",
    "note that such prior information is substantially more than that used to optimize our test which was a knowledge of only the burst duration .",
    "nonetheless , assuming that such information was available to us  ( and no more ) , then the following would be the ideal scheme we should compare our test with .    in the ideal scheme  ( similar to  @xcite ) ,",
    "we first band pass filter the data @xmath13 .",
    "since we know the bursts are of type  ( 2 ) , let the filter pass band be @xmath76  hz wide , centered at the frequency @xmath75  hz .",
    "the output of the filter is demodulated and the resulting quadrature components , say @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , are resampled down to a sampling frequency of @xmath83 .",

    "thus , total number of operations involved is @xmath101 .",
    "( 4 ) finally , for each frequency , the _ t_-statistic is compared to a threshold , involving @xmath102 operations in all .",

    "as an example , for @xmath104  hz , @xmath71  sec and @xmath105  sec , the required computing speed is @xmath106  mflops .",

    "\\(b ) _ stochastic_. this is the part involving the application of the veto to the raw image ( c.f",
    ".  sec .",
    "[ sec2_2 ] ) .",
    "since the number of black pixels in the image after thresholding as well as the size of the black - pixel patches are random variables , the number of operations involved in this part is also a random variable .",
    "one expects , however , that for low false alarm rates , the computational cost of this part will be much smaller than that of the deterministic part since clusters would only occur sparsely in the image .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the computational load because of the stochastic part is via monte carlo simulations in which the number of operations involved in the stochastic part are explicitly counted within the code itself . in table",
    "[ tableii ] , we present the number of floating point operations incurred in the stochastic part , as a fraction of the total number of operations incurred in the deterministic part , over a wide range of false alarm rates for stationary input noise . ( to generate table  [ tableii ] , the test parameters used were @xmath71  sec , @xmath72  sec and @xmath73 .",
    "the sampling frequency of the input data was 1000  hz , each realization being 20  sec long .",
    "the operations were counted over 200 trials . )    from table  [ tableii ] , we see that even when the false alarm rate is as high as 50 events / hour , the time spent in the stochastic part is negligible compared to that involved in generating the raw image itself .",
    "the computational cost of generating the image itself  ( the deterministic part ) is quite low as shown above .",
    "hence , overall , the test can be implemented without significant computational costs .",
    "a test for the detection of non - stationarity is presented which has the important property of being robust .",
    "this allows the test to be used on data without the need to first characterize the data statistically .",
    "the main results of this work are ( i ) the demonstration , using monte carlo simulations , of the insensitivity of the false alarm rate at a given threshold to the statistical nature of the data being analyzed , and ( ii ) application of the test to the detection of different types of bursts which showed that the test can detect fairly weak bursts .",
    "for instance , as shown in table  [ tablei ] , the test could detect 80% of narrowband bursts , each located within a band of 20  hz centered at 200  hz , that were added to gaussian noise with a psd such as that of ligo - i when the peak amplitude of the bursts was only @xmath107 and the false alarm rate for the test was 1  event / hour .",
    "we did not catalog the false alarm rate or detection probability for a large number of cases since real applications will almost always fall outside any such catalog . instead , for false alarm rate , we chose a rather extreme range for the types of stationary noise so that a bound on the robustness could be obtained . while , for detection probability , our main aim was to demonstrate that , given its robustness , the test performs quite well in realistic situations . when applying the test to a particular data set",
    ", the appropriate false alarm versus threshold curve can be obtained easily using a single monte carlo simulation .",
    "almost always , the experimenter has some prior idea of the _ range _ of burst durations he / she is interested in and therefore can choose the set of test parameters appropriately .",
    "this would be necessary for any test of non - stationarity , and not particularly the present one , since non - stationarity can take many forms .",
    "a more general approach would require understanding the test analytically .",
    "this work is in progress .    though we mentioned the problem of narrow band noise ( c.f .",
    "[ sec3_3 ] ) it was not addressed in detail .",
    "this is because this is an issue that is fundamental to all tests for transient non - stationarity and not specific to the present test alone .",
    "narrow band noise , such as power supply interference at 60  hz and its harmonics or the thermal noise associated with the violin modes of suspension wires , appear non - stationary on timescales much shorter than their correlation length .",
    "thus , if a narrow band noise component has significant power , the frequency band ( max[frequency resolution , line width ] ) containing it will appear non - stationary to any test that searches for short duration transients . on the other hand , _ steady _ narrowband signals in the data can suppress the detection of non - stationarity that happens to lie close to them in frequency .",
    "this is because detection of short bursts implies an increase in time resolution and , correspondingly , a decrease in frequency resolution .",
    "thus if the narrowband signals are strong , they can make the frequency bins containing them appear stationary .",
    "this problem can be addressed in several ways .",
    "a preliminary look at the psd can tell us about the frequency bands where narrowband interference is severe and the output of the test in those bands can be discarded from further analysis .",
    "another way could be to decrease the time resolution sufficiently though at the cost of losing short bursts .",
    "a more direct and effective approach would be to pass the data through time domain filters that notch the offending frequencies .",
    "such filters could also be made adaptive so that the frequencies can be tracked in time  @xcite .",

    "<S> apart from being robust , this test has properties which make it suitable as an online monitor of stationarity . </S>"
