    "<S> lastly , we conclude that for a fixed geometry the usual rectangular double - well and the hole potentials become special for some calculable discrete values of the height and depth parameter . then the double - well entails the barrier - top eigenstate and the hole admits the zero - energy eigenstate . these eigenstates can be detected only by invoking the linear @xmath110 solution of schrdinger equation in the barrier region in the former case and out - side the hole in the latter case . </S>",
    "<S> but for these special eigenstates the spectrum of these special potentials would not be complete . </S>"
