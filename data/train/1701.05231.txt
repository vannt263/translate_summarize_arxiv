    "the problem of a powerful outburst in a nearly homogeneous medium under spherical symmetry plays an important role in a number of astrophysical contexts , ranging from supernova remnants to agn feedback in the cores of galaxy clusters . in the latter case ,",
    "particularly important questions are ( i ) deriving the energetics of the outburst from readily available observables and ( ii ) determining what fraction of the outburst energy is going to be thermalized in the gas .",
    "they are also the questions that we address in this paper .",
    "the importance of agn activity on the icm thermal state in clusters and elliptical galaxies is nowadays widely accepted , see for a review .",
    "the cooling time of the icm in cluster cores is short and a source of energy is needed to prevent a massive build up of cold gas and vigorous star formation .",
    "this energy is believed to come from a central supermassive black hole , although the description of the energy transfer from agn to icm is still sketchy .",
    "multi - wavelength observations reveal that agn jets inflate bubbles of relativistic plasma ( or at least a mixture of relativistic particles and very hot plasma ) .",
    "when energy is injected in an unperturbed medium , the expanding bubble initially drives a strong shock in the surrounding medium and heats the gas .",
    "later , the bubble expansion becomes subsonic and the shock - heating efficiency drops dramatically .",
    "the energy goes instead into the thermal energy of the expanding bubble and @xmath8 work .",
    "eventually , bubbles are removed from the cluster core by the buoyancy force . during the process",
    ", the rising bubbles must loose their energy after crossing several pressure scale heights @xcite and can excite turbulence and/or internal waves that are eventually dissipated into heat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sound waves could also contribute to the gas heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if a substantial fraction of energy goes into the waves and they are able to dissipate .",
    "yet another scenario postulates that the bubbles are filled with hot , but non - relativistic , plasma and mixing of this plasma with the icm is the dominant channel for icm heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    which of these scenarios dominate depends on the way agn injects energy to the icm .",
    "while this problem has been addressed in many sophisticated 3d numerical simulations , the uncertainties in choosing the right approximation and parameters precludes unambiguous conclusion .",
    "a simpler approach is to use the minimalistic set of assumptions to get order of magnitude constraints on a few of the most important parameters .",
    "for instance , one - dimensional ( 1d )",
    "spherically symmetric outburst powered by agn activity is probably the simplest among all models .",
    "it was studied , e.g. , in @xcite where constraints on the energy / luminosity and duration of the outburst have been obtained . in all these cases",
    "the simulations were tailored for a particular object .",
    "several questions arise : ( i ) are the results obtained for well studied systems universal , ( ii ) what are the most extreme cases allowed by models , e.g. , maximal amount of energy in the form of sound waves , ( iii ) can one use a few observables to estimate the properties of an outburst without doing actual simulations ? to address these question",
    "we made a systematic study of an outburst evolution in a very simple setup and derive a scaling needed to apply this analysis to other systems .    in this paper",
    "we closely investigate the evolution of an outburst in a low density hot medium under spherical symmetry .",
    "qualitatively , `` low density '' is assumed to indicate that the radiative energy losses are negligible on time scales of the outburst evolution .",
    "the assumption of `` hot '' means that despite the low density , the thermal pressure in the ambient medium is not negligible and is dynamically important for the expansion of an outburst . because of the high pressure in the medium , the shock wave driven by the outburst gradually transforms from a strong shock into a weak shock and",
    "eventually asymptotically approaches a sound wave as @xmath9 .    in  [ sec :",
    "simple ] , we describe the main assumptions / approximation made in the paper . in  [ uniform medium ] , we systematically study the evolution of an outburst in uniform medium . in ",
    "[ non - uniform ] , we use the perseus cluster and m87 as examples to show that the evolution of an outburst in a realistic density and pressure profile of a galaxy cluster does not deviate much from those results in uniform medium .",
    "we then develop simple tools to map the observables to the intrinsic properties of an outburst based on simulation with uniform medium . in ",
    "[ sec : classification ] , we create a schematic figure to illustrate the various regimes and physical processes related to the problem of agn driven outburst and then discuss the physical properties of the outbursts in perseus cluster and m87 . ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion section .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to use 1d spherically symmetric outburst model to derive the most basic constraints on the spatial structure and energy partition of agn driven outbursts in galaxy cluster .",
    "here we outline main assumptions and simplifications made in our discussion .",
    "the initial gas density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 distributions of the icm are assumed to be static , where @xmath12 is the distance from the cluster center . in the presence of pressure gradients , a balancing force due to gravity is taken into account to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium . thermal conduction and physical viscosity",
    "are neglected for simplification . at age @xmath13 ,",
    "energy and mass start to be injected into the center of the cluster . in our simplified problem , for a given @xmath10 and @xmath11 profiles of the icm , the evolution of an outburst is fully determined by its energy and mass injection history . in this paper , we consider simplified energy and mass injection ( see appendix [ ap : a ] for a detailed description ) which are characterized by three parameters : total injected energy @xmath1 , total injected mass @xmath14 and the duration of the outburst @xmath2 .",
    "the adiabatic index of the injected material is @xmath15 , while the ambient gas has the adiabatic index @xmath16 . in the context of galaxy clusters ,",
    "this setup is very similar to the one used in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the fate of such outbursts could fall into two different evolution tracks depending on the value of the dimensionless ratio @xmath17 , see appendix [ ap : b0 ] for detailed discussion . in most astrophysical applications , like the agn feedback problem studied here ,",
    "the ratio @xmath18 and the evolution of the outburst could be divided into three different phases , if we make analogy to instantaneous outburst with @xmath19 for outbursts with finite duration time @xmath2 .",
    "based on the relation between the injected energy @xmath1 and mass @xmath14 and the swept up materials thermal energy @xmath20 and mass @xmath21 , the three phases are free expansion phase with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , sedov - taylor ( st ) phase @xcite with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and a wave - like phase with @xmath26 . for the agn feedback problem of interest here",
    ", @xmath14 is unknown from observation but likely to be small , and the free expansion phase is likely to be very brief .",
    "so in the rest of the paper , we could simply neglect the injected mass @xmath14 and ignore the free expansion phase which are not very important for our discussion . in view of the weak",
    "shock observed in galaxy cluster , we will focus on the transition from st phase to wave - like phase in this paper .",
    "the transition from st phase to the wave - like phase happens when the thermal energy of swept up materials @xmath20 becomes comparable with the injected energy @xmath1 .",
    "it sets the characteristic length @xmath27 and time @xmath28 of the system , see appendix [ ap : b ] for detail .",
    "@xmath27 is the characteristic radius of a sphere such that the total thermal energy of the icm within the sphere is of order of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath29 where we have assumed for simplicity that the pressure @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath28 is the sound crossing time of @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath31 in the subsequent sections , we will study the evolution of an outburst during such transition for different combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "two special cases that deserve more discussions are ( i ) the instantaneous outburst with @xmath32 and ( ii ) the continuous outburst ( or `` slow piston '' mode ) with @xmath33 .",
    "they behave very differently during the transition from the early st phase to the late wave - like phase especially in energy partition . in the first case ,",
    "a large amount of energy is released during a short period of time . when the energy release quenches , a strong shock still exists which could heat the surrounding ambient gas and generate a significant amount of entropy .",
    "we also expect that the state of such an outburst at age @xmath34 will not be very sensitive to the actual value of @xmath2 . in the second case ,",
    "the injected energy is released over a time scale much larger than the characteristic time @xmath28 of the system . as a result ,",
    "the ejecta always expand subsonically , except for a short interval at early time , and no net entropy generation in the icm is happening .",
    "extensive efforts have been made for the two limiting cases by previous analytical work . for an instantaneous outburst , it follows the classic st solution at @xmath35 @xcite while at @xmath36 the shock wave driven by the outburst asymptotically approaches a sound wave due to the ambient pressure .",
    "the transition from classic st solution to the asymptotic wave - like solution is studied by @xcite and @xcite according to perturbation theory but only valid when the deviation from st solution is not very large .",
    "the asymptotical behavior of the outburst at @xmath36 has been studied by @xcite and @xcite but focusing on the decay of the shock front .",
    "the global structure and energy partition of the outburst however are not discussed in detail . for a continuous outburst , the self - similar solution as an extension of the classic st solution is available at @xmath35 @xcite , if the energy injection in space and time satisfies certain conditions . at @xmath36",
    ", the shock front gradually decays due to ambient pressure and eventually disappear .",
    "no wave - like structure is generated in a continuous outburst , because the energy injection never quenches and thus no rarefaction structure is formed behind the shock front .",
    "the transition between the asymptotic st solution at @xmath35 to the asymptotic wave - like solution at @xmath36 is difficult to model analytically and will be studied numerically .",
    "the time evolution of an outburst with finite @xmath2 hasnt been discussed before and will become the focus of this paper .",
    "our final goal is to link the observables to all major characteristics of the outburst , including @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and then differentiate between cases according to different @xmath37 ratios . among these observables",
    "the most easily accessible are : the mach number @xmath38 and the radius of the shock front @xmath39 , and the radius of the ejecta @xmath40 .",
    "the latter quantity can be derived from observations by measuring the size of `` radio bubbles '' inflated by an agn .",
    "we therefore investigate the relation between these observables and the characteristic properties of the outburst in detail for different combinations of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 . in section [ uniform medium ] , we present the results for uniform ambient medium .",
    "next , in section [ non - uniform ] , we discuss how a more realistic radial profile of the ambient medium affects the results from uniform medium case . the numerical method used in this paper",
    "is described in appendix  [ ap : num ] .",
    "[ uniform medium ] [ sec : uniform ] in this section , we investigate the dynamical evolution of an outburst in a uniform media with constant density and pressure profile , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we will focus on the spatial structure and energy distribution of the outburst during the transition from the st phase to the wave - like phase .",
    "the natural way to illustrate the complete physical picture is to divide the problem into different regimes based on the @xmath37 ratio and then investigate the physical properties of an outburst as a function of @xmath43 in each individual regime closely . in this section ,",
    "all the results are presented in dimensionless form to keep the generality of our discussion .    in order to demonstrate the energy distribution of an outburst over radius ,",
    "we calculate cumulative kinetic @xmath44 and thermal @xmath45 energies , which are defined as follows @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the flow velocity at radius @xmath12 and age @xmath0 , and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass within radius @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the initial distribution of internal energy per unit mass in the ambient medium . in the calculation of @xmath45",
    ", we subtract the initial internal energy in the swept up materials to focus on only the spatial distribution of the injected outburst energy @xmath1 .",
