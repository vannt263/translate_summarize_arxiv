    "the string theory is a very valuable tool for us to understand properties of the black hole .",
    "one of the great successes in this field is the statistical explanation of the bekenstein - hawking entropy for the certain extremal and the near extremal black hole .",
    "different types of black holes have been studied well and all of them support the explanation for the bekenstein - hawking entropy since the first success in @xcite .",
    "recent works in this field have focused on the question that in stationary spacetime allowing the event horizon is not killing horizon @xcite . some former works",
    "@xcite may forbid this construction .",
    "however , from a physical perspective , there are two different surface gravities at the horizons where they connect two asymptotic spaces , which indicate different temperatures . in thermodynamic theory , this is a description about a steady heat stream between two infinite heat reservoirs that preserve a fixed temperature gradient when the time is under evolution @xcite .    in article @xcite ,",
    "a flowing horizon was constructed by a very impressive way .",
    "basically , they build up the construction with a schwarzschlid metric that is a static black hole solution .",
    "however , in this article we extend the former solution to more general conditions .",
    "we consider a kerr metric to construct the flow , and it is easy to extend to a kerr - newman metric condition . even though the descriptions of horizon flows motivated by ads / cft @xcite have been studied well , as the same reason in @xcite , in our construction we do not need a negative cosmological constant to hold the system steadily .",
    "we begin our construction from such a picture : a very thin black string falls perpendicularly and smoothly into a very large black hole . their radius",
    "are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "both the black string and the black hole rotate with the same angular velocity @xmath2 and the axes of the rotation is the direction of the falling black string flow . since we have @xmath3 , given that the surface gravity is inverse ratio to the radius , we know that the surface gravity of black string is much larger than the surface gravity of black hole .",
    "when the string is falling into the black hole horizon without any external interference , we can anticipate that the two horizons fuse smoothly into each other . by this construction ,",
    "the black hole can accumulate mass from the falling string and , as the consequence , the black hole must grow in size irreversibly .    however ,",
    "when we take the limit @xmath4 and hold @xmath0 fixed , and then just pay attention on events that happen in the intersected region we can get rid of the effect of the growing of the black hole .",
    "the black hole horizon then becomes a rindler - like infinite horizon because of the rotation .",
    "if the angular velocity is zero , the horizon is exactly the rindler horizon . by changing to the rest frame of the falling black string ,",
    "the acceleration horizon vanishes .",
    "then we have a configuration of a stationary black string . alternatively ,",
    "if we take a stationary black string and study it from a frame that accelerates along the direction of the string , what we observe is that a string free falls into an acceleration horizon",
    ". we will construct the event horizon for such acceleration observers and study how the rotation will affect the result , and then make a comparison with the non - rotation result .",
    "the arrangement of this paper are : in section 2 we will construct a kerr black string flow and study the properties of the construction . in section 3",
    "we will study the black string flow and its equilibrium condition , and then extend to a more general model .",
    "the last section is our conclusion and outlook .",
    "configurations of higher dimensional rotating and charged black holes obtained in string theory have been studied a lot on a micro level @xcite . unlike these constructions above , we follow @xcite to build up a new metric .      in article",
    "@xcite the authors give their metric as follows @xmath5 it is a black string flow without rotation in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions .",
    "generally we can generalize metric ( 2.1 ) to a new expression with rotation @xmath7d\\phi ^2 \\nonumber\\\\      & -&\\frac{4mr\\alpha sin^2 \\theta}{\\rho ^2}dtd\\phi + fdz^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and f is the metric function that should have a positive sign outside the black string horizon and be finite at @xmath9 when @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the metric ( 2.2 ) is in the rest frame of the free - falling and rotating black string in d=5 dimensions .",
    "when the black string is missing @xmath10 , we have the null surfaces @xmath11 that are the acceleration horizons with different constant @xmath12 .",
    "one condition we need to guarantee is that when it is far from the string and at the same time the rotation can be neglected , the null rays can change to the conventional rindler horizon , i.e. , @xmath13 where the dot indicates the derivative of an affine parameter @xmath14 . by transforming the metric into boyer - lindquist coordinate",
    ", we have @xmath15 with @xmath16 the relations between new and old metric are @xmath17 since the affine parameter @xmath14 is also valid in new coordinate system , we have the null path @xmath18 and @xmath19 in equation ( 2.14 ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two integration constants because of the isometries generated by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the details are given in appendix a. from equations ( 2.5 ) , ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.12 ) we know the relations between @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath24 and because @xmath25 we get @xmath26 we can neglect the contributions of f and @xmath27 because when @xmath9 , both of them approximate to 1 .",
    "now from the equations ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.18 ) , we have the representation of @xmath28 @xmath29 with @xmath30 using equations ( 2.13 ) and ( 2.19 ) , we have @xmath31 because both of the @xmath28 and @xmath32 can be represented by @xmath33 , we can deduce an equation that consists of @xmath28 , @xmath33 and @xmath32 , @xmath34 equation ( 2.22 ) can be proved by putting equations ( 2.19 ) and ( 2.21 ) into equation ( 2.22 )",
    ". then the null hypersurfaces ruled by the one - form equation are @xmath35 where @xmath36 back to the old coordinate system we get @xmath37 when @xmath38 , kerr metric will return to schwarzschlid metric . by setting f=1 and @xmath39 for convenience ,",
    "the null hypersurfaces become @xmath40 these are the null hypersurfaces ruled by geodesics in @xcite .    because of the missing symmetry , equations ( 2.23 ) and ( 2.24 ) both have extremely complicated resolutions . for convenience and",
    "no losing generality , we first set @xmath41 and @xmath42 , then just study the event horizon at @xmath43 . in this way",
    "we get the new one - form equation @xmath44 benefiting from @xmath45 the old coordinate system is equal to new one and as a consequence we get @xmath46 then we have @xmath47 each value of @xmath12 results in a corresponding null hypersurface that ends at different value in the null coordinate in future null infinity .",
    "clearly any of them can be regarded as our event horizon . here ,",
    "for convenience , we denote the null hypersurface with @xmath48 as the horizon .",
    "this is not a stationary horizon : the action of @xmath49 can change @xmath12 , therefore it does not map a hypersurface onto itself but onto another one instead . the explicit form of the integral result of @xmath50 in ( 2.28 ) is given it in the appendix b. the surfaces @xmath51 are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "null hypersurfaces @xmath51 of the black string flow are plotted from equation ( 2.28 ) in ( t , r , z ) space for @xmath52 and @xmath43 .",
    "the left one is the out - going hypersurface which means we choose the positive sign in equation ( 2.28 ) .",

    ", we just consider the negative term in equation ( 2.23 ) which corresponds to the outgoing hypersurface .",

    "any objects have to rotate with the black hole , but at the same time they are free to move toward or away from the event horizon .",
    "when we consider the kerr black string flow , the same thing happens on hypersurface @xmath51 .",
    "according to equation ( 2.33 ) and figure 2 , we find that all null rays on @xmath51 must go towards @xmath9 as the @xmath14 grows .",
    "this means that any timelike trajectory that remains within the bounded values of r will cross @xmath51 at last . as a consequence ,",
    "any observers that remain within a finite range of the black string will fall across @xmath51 eventually . as the same as the story in kerr black hole , any observers inside this surface can not remain static but are dragged along with the string , so this is a particular ergoshpere that the kerr string flow can distinguish from an ordinary kerr black hole",
    ".    in our construction the black string is accelerating , and then the ergoregion grows . for any observes who wants to avoid to fall across this @xmath51 ,",
    "an acceleration in the z direction is not enough , they also need to move out towards @xmath9 .",
    "even though the hypersurface @xmath51 we consider here is a special case , it is straightforward to extend this analysis to any @xmath71 .",
    "let us consider the vector @xmath72 this is an affine generator of the null geodesic congruence .",
    "it is convenient to consider the following non - affine generator , which relates to the proper time @xmath73 in this way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are constants , is an affine parameter .",

    "by setting @xmath41 we get the surface gravity @xmath84 which coincides with the result in @xcite .",
    "there is a chance that by setting a specific @xmath85 we can make the surface gravity @xmath86 .",

    "above the extreme situation , the string excitation is much hotter than that of the black hole , and the system seems to have a different behavior from the configuration which the string excitation is in thermal equilibrium with a finite temperature horizon ( a worldsheet approach @xcite or a blackfold approach @xcite ) . in this formation , when the black string does not attain to extreme , it will dump energy to the black hole .",
    "in this paper , we generally give and analyze a model of the rotating black string flow in dimension d=5 , and extend this solution to a charged and rotating black sting flow , and study their equilibrium conditions . in these constructions ,",
    "the smooth intersection between the black hole and black string is in the axisymmetric spacetime , which has directly practical physics picture .",
    "the system we study here requires that the string is very thin comparing with the black hole and the whole progress is free from any external force interference .",
    "when studying the instability of the black string in the late time evolution , a similar construction has been found @xcite .",
    "the microscopic construction of the place where the black string and black hole intersect is very interesting .",
    "another interesting field is the similarity between the black funnels and the black string flow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there should be some relations between the rotating black string flow and some kinds of black funnels . using this method we can extend to other situations , for example , a free falling string that is not rotated falls into a rotating black hole . under this construction",
    "we may expect the rotation velocity of the black hole decreases to zero after the string pour enough mass to this system .",
