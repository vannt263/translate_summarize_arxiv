    "while the standard model of particle physics has passed all experimental tests to date , it lacks a particle candidate that could provide the dark matter of the universe as expected from astronomical observations .",
    "furthermore , our present understanding of structure formation seems to indicate that some fraction of the dark matter should be `` cold '' , so as to generate the proper power spectrum .",
    "such dark matter candidates are quite common in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "indeed , many models predict long lived relics that may or may not be dark matter candidates . long lifetimes for heavy relics , where by `` long '' we mean within several orders of magnitude of the age of the universe may arise in many models which have symmetries that are only broken at short distances .",
    "thus it is interesting to investigate the observational signatures of such long lived relics in an effort to rule out classes of models .    in this paper",
    "we study the signatures of particles with lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe . such particles could play a role in solving the dark matter problem , but we will not confine our analysis to dark matter candidates .",
    "the inclusion of long lived heavy ( @xmath1 ) particles necessitates an extension of the standard model .",
    "these relics could be technibaryons in technicolor models or the lightest supersymmetric partner in an r - parity violating supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "the bounds found here are model independent and depend on only three parameters : the mass @xmath2 , the lifetime @xmath3 and the radiative or hadronic branching ratio times the relic density @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . given any model , it is possible to calculate the relic density using standard techniques leading to bounds on couplings as well as masses .",
    "our exclusion bounds are derived by considering the direct observation of the gamma rays produced in the decay process . in general , the predicted observed",
    "spectrum will differ greatly from the decay spectrum due to redshifting and scattering in the early universe .",
    "the final spectrum can be compared to the egret and comptel data leading to the exclusion plots presented here .",
    "previous investigations  @xcite of the gamma ray spectra produced by long lived relics have concentrated on radiative decays into either photons or charged particles .",
    "we consider both radiative and hadronic decays , including the effects of photon ",
    "photon scattering and @xmath6 pair production .",
    "there are reasons to believe that hadronic decays are more compelling .",
    "first , the hadronic branching ratio of the relics is expected to be of order one , unless there is a symmetry which forbids such decays .",
    "radiative decays usually arise at the one loop level and so one would expect smaller branching ratios .",
    "second , hadronic decays produce more photons in the softer part of the spectrum due to fragmentation , which produces a large number of pions that decay to two photons .",
    "thus , as opposed to the case of radiative decay , we expect the non - scattered spectra to have more photons at smaller energies ( i.e.  @xmath7 ) .",
    "since the diffuse photon background spectrum is well measured only up to @xmath8  gev , we would naively expect our bounds to apply to larger mass relics @xmath9  gev for hadronic decays but not for radiative decays .",
    "however , bounds derived from radiative decays of large mass relics can be obtained if a reprocessing mechanism to lower the photon energy is active .",
    "such mechanisms begin operating once injected photon energies are above about @xmath10  gev where radiative decays can potentially compete with hadronic decays and produce large numbers of photons at low energy for masses larger than roughly @xmath11  gev .",
    "thus , a complete calculation is necessary to determine the bound for a given mode of decay , as we present here .",
    "it should be noted that some of the bounds derived here will overlap those coming from structure formation arguments in the part of parameter space where the relic density is of the order of the critical density .",
    "radiative decay can lead to a radiation dominated epoch after recombination that would drastically distort the observed power spectrum .",
    "thus the shorter lifetimes considered here could lead to such distortions , but we will not consider these effects .",
    "a high energy photon injected in the early universe will , in general , scatter .",
    "since there are many scattering processes possible , the nature of the scattering is strongly dependent on the redshift at which the photon is injected as well as its energy .",
    "each process has a characteristic optical depth which determines its relevance to the evolution of the photon .",
    "the relevant processes were investigated in detail by zdziarski and svensson in ref .",
    "the processes include : @xmath6 pair production ( pp ) , photon  photon scattering ( gg ) , compton scattering and pair production off of matter ( ppm ) . figure  [ ze - region - fig ] ( derived from  @xcite ) divides the redshift energy plane into regions labeled by the process that dominates in a particular part of the graph .",
    "the photons always have injected energies , @xmath12  mev , which is obviously true of radiative decays of heavy relics and is also true of hadronic decays due to a cutoff in the spectrum at @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the mechanisms for rescattering photons with energies below about @xmath14  mev are irrelevant to our analysis . details of the spectra and cutoffs are described in the following sections .    given the initial energy of the photon and the redshift at which it was injected , the progress of the injected photon can be tracked by moving horizontally across fig .",
    "[ ze - region - fig ] . for large enough photon energies ,",
    "the time scale for scattering is short compared to the expansion rate of the universe , so we may neglect any vertical motion until we reach the region where compton scattering dominates ( not shown ; to the left of the left edge of the graph ) or where the photon reaches the point where its optical depth drops below one . in the limit that the photon energy is much smaller than the mass of the electron ( thompson limit )",
    ", the cross section for compton scattering is independent of energy .",
    "when the photons reach the region of the plot dominated by compton scattering in the thompson limit , the photons will eventually be in kinetic equilibrium with the thermal bath leading to a finite chemical potential for the photons .",
    "the resulting distortion of the precisely measured microwave background leads to bounds on the injection of low - energy photons prior to recombination ( @xmath15 ) , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for photons with redshifts in the range @xmath16",
    ", the electromagnetic cascades result in the production of @xmath17he and d via the disintegration of @xmath18he .",
    "thus , there will be even more stringent bounds for this range of redshifts coming from limits on primordial abundances of light elements  @xcite .",
    "here we concern ourselves with bounds coming from direct observations of gamma rays , and therefore we will be interested in photons whose life begins in the region dominated by pair production or photon  photon scattering after the epoch of recombination .",
    "such photons will eventually reach the region of the plot where the optical depth drops below one and can be directly detected .",
    "pair production leads to a cascade , since the hot electron - positron pairs produced will inverse compton scatter in the klein - nishina regime ( @xmath19 ) , where they generate very energetic photons , which will in turn pair produce again .",
    "this process will continue until the photon energies drop to the point where pair production off the wien tail of the black - body distribution is no longer efficient , or until we reach a regime where some other process ( e.g.  photon  photon scattering ) begins to dominate .",
    "note that during this cascade process the mean free path for pair production is much smaller than the local hubble length .",
    "we may therefore calculate the cascade rate without regard to the effects of the expansion rate on the energies or occupation numbers .",
    "for the region of energies and redshift relevant to our analysis , photons will follow one of four paths .",
    "if the photon is injected in the region where the optical depth is less than one , then the redshifted photon will free stream to the detector .",
    "a photon injected in the region dominated by pair production will induce an electromagnetic cascade resulting in an `` escape photon spectrum '' , that was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and is presented in the next section .",
    "the spectrum terminates at @xmath20 , defined as the energy above which a photon will pair produce and degrade its energy .",
    "the line dividing the pp and @xmath21 regions in fig .",
    "[ ze - region - fig ] is @xmath20 as a function of redshift .",
    "a photon born in the region dominated by pair production with a redshift in the range @xmath22 will have a slightly different fate the photons undergo pair production off of matter , but the resulting spectrum has not been calculated .",
    "most of these photons will eventually reach kinetic equilibrium via compton scattering . ] . in this regime ,",
    "photon scattering becomes relevant  @xcite since the energy of the photons are degraded and pass through the region gg in fig  [ ze - region - fig ] .",
    "the width of this shaded region is given by  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the temperature of the microwave background in units of @xmath27  k. the existence of this region has the effect of further distorting the photon spectrum , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "finally , if a photon is injected directly into the region where photon  photon scattering dominates , it will lead to yet another spectrum of escape photons .",
    "to quantify the photon scattering processes , we divide the region into three segments in redshift @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "this division in redshift , along with the forthcoming divisions in energy ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , provide an approximation to fig .",
    "[ ze - region - fig ] that we use throughout the following discussion of scattering processes .",

    "if the lifetime is short relative to the age of the universe , then most of the photons would be reprocessed at or before recombination , and would not reach the detector .",

    "this lower value of @xmath20 leads to showering at lower values of the relic mass and thus the bounds found in  @xcite have a different mass dependence than found here . as discussed in the previous section , compton scattering",
    "does not become important until much lower energies  @xcite and does not play a role in the determination of @xmath20 .",

    "[ 2-body-25 - 200-fig ] ) , allows one to derive the bound on the relic density for a given mass and lifetime as shown in the upper graph of fig .",

    "[ 2-body - bound - fig ] is an increasing upper bound on @xmath136 as the injected energy is raised up to about @xmath137  gev , and then a steady decrease thereafter for larger injected energies .",
    "the reason for this trend in the bounds for 2-body decays is due to the transition noted in table  [ 2-body - crit - table ] when the injected energy crosses @xmath119  gev .",
    "as remarked above , the value @xmath120  gev at this transition implies that for all injected energies above @xmath138  gev , bounds can only be derived using the _ scattered _ photons .",
    "since the number of photons increases as the injected energy increases in the scattering regime , the bounds are stronger as the energy is increased above @xmath138  gev .",
    "this effect is further enhanced by the fact that as the mass of the relic increases showering can occur at smaller redshifts .",
    "as the injected energy is reduced below @xmath138  gev , more of the non - scattered , redshifted photons appear , and so a better bound comes from lowering the injected energy .",
    "this is clear since the best bound comes from the lowest injected energy considered , @xmath132  gev .",
    "the one special case is for @xmath137  gev where the best bound for long lifetimes @xmath139 is not the highest present - day detection energy , but instead slightly less @xmath140  mev .",
    "the reason the bound comes from lower energies is due the @xmath61 suppression in the scattered photons that exists for present - day energies within a factor of @xmath141 lower than @xmath142  gev . since the diffuse background scales as @xmath143 , the best bound will be determined by the point where the redshifted spectrums slope is equal to the slope of the diffuse background",
    "this point is roughly given by @xmath144 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the bounds for shorter lifetimes show scalings with the mass .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that for shorter lifetimes the bounds begin to lay on top of each other in fig .",
    "[ 2-body - bound - fig ] . this scaling",
    "is seen to group into two lines : one line of which consists of the relics whose bounds come from scattering ( i.e.  @xmath145  gev ) and another line for those relics whose photons can be directly detected .",
    "the bounds on radiative decays calculated above are strong , but it is not obvious that such decays ought to dominate the branching ratio of heavy relics . here",
    "we establish bounds on relic particles that decay through hadronic channels .",
    "we consider 3-body decays of relics into all kinematically available quark pairs and one uncolored ( assumed massless ) spectator .",

    "axial couplings leading to both charged and neutral current mediated decays .",
    "( ckm mixing is ignored since it is in general model dependent and can be absorbed into the couplings ) .",
    "we take @xmath146 , and so two thresholds exist with increasing mass @xmath2 of the relic : @xmath147 ( for charged current mediated decays ) and @xmath148 ( for neutral current mediated decays ) .",
    "thus , for a given mass @xmath2 , an ensemble of relic decays with final quark energy and momenta spanning the 3-body phase space can be constructed .",
    "the quark pairs are fragmented and decayed according to the string fragmentation scheme  @xcite implemented in jetset  @xcite .",
    "this fragmentation scheme has been well tested with collider experiment data , and the resulting photon spectrum from jetset is discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , the exact of shape and normalization of the photon spectrum depends on the particular final state quarks  @xcite but generally scales with the relic mass @xmath2 , which we discuss below .",
    "once the spectrum is calculated , the present - day photon flux can be determined from ( [ redshift - eq ] ) .",
    "the 3-body decay allows energy to escape with the uncolored decay product .",
    "hence , the integrated photon spectrum appearing after the hadronization and decay of the @xmath149 system is always less than @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the hadronization process does not uniquely end with neutral pions , as some energy leaks into leptons .",
    "we consider only the effects of pion decays into photons .",

    "we have included final state electromagnetic and qcd radiation showers prior to fragmentation , although the showering is performed only off the final state quark pair .",
    "the particular quark pair @xmath153 is a special case since the top quark decays before it fragments .",
    "however , the photon spectrum is not particularly sensitive to monte carlo ordering of decay vs.  fragmentation ( jetset fragments before decay ) . in particular",
    ", we compared the photon spectrum produced from the pythia process @xmath154 after fragmentation ( with no initial state radiation ) at large energies @xmath155 with the top quark decaying before and after fragmentation .",
    "the photon spectrum is slightly enhanced for energies @xmath156 when the top quark is allowed to decay before it fragments .",
    "however , the dominant effect on our bounds from relic decays into heavy top quarks comes from the large number of photons produced at _ low _ energies .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ compare - fig ] clearly shows a much larger number of photons from the hadronization of light quarks ( @xmath157 , @xmath158 , etc . ) at energies @xmath159 where one would roughly expect the slight enhancement in the top quark photon spectrum .",
    "thus in regimes where the higher energy photons define the bound , it is the light quarks photon spectrum that is crucial .",
    "the photon spectrum originates almost entirely from decaying pions , which are created in the quark fragmentation process  @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given decay @xmath160 , the spectra scale with @xmath2 and can be normalized to the mass of the relic .",
    "it is only the finite mass of the pion that breaks the scaling behavior .",
    "the photon spectrum is also virtually independent of the vector ",
    "axial couplings in the 3-body phase space .",
    "the only energy dependence enters in the mass of the uncolored product which we take to be negligible compared with the mass of the relic .",
    "in fact , a large non - zero uncolored product mass could be easily accommodated by simply reducing the relic mass by approximately the mass of the uncolored product .",
    "once the photon spectrum has been obtained from jetset , it is fit to a sum of exponentials  @xcite @xmath161 where @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 are positive constants .",
    "the fit gives a reasonable characterization of the photon spectrum valid for @xmath167 .",
    "the dependence of the fit on the monte carlo statistics is small . increasing the statistics by a factor of 5 shifts the final redshifted spectra by at most @xmath168 .",
    "we have scanned the relic mass range over more than two orders of magnitude from @xmath169  gev ( a likely lower bound from lep ) through @xmath170  tev in steps of a factor of @xmath98 .",

    "the photon fluxes are virtually identical throughout most of the mass range , with the neutral current interaction usually giving a slightly larger value ( due to decays into top quark pairs ) than decays via charged current interactions . however , in the mass window @xmath177 the photon flux from a charged current interaction is about a factor of two greater than the equivalent spectra from a neutral current interaction , since the @xmath178 decay mode is open .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ compare - fig ] that most of the photons are well below @xmath150 , so that the effect of scattering for hadronic decays is not as prominent as in radiative decays for the same relic mass .",

    "photon scattering  ( [ gg - eq ] ) , pair production at low @xmath62  ( [ pp - lowz - eq ] ) and pair production at high @xmath62  ( [ pp - highz - eq ] ) are used in the same way as in radiative decays .",
    "we need only determine how much energy is injected into each regime . since the energy injected into this regime is dependent on @xmath20 and @xmath42 , which are in turn dependent on the redshift @xmath62 , the procedure must be done numerically .    as noted above the non - scattered spectra",
    "are cutoff at @xmath13 , whereas the scattered spectra have no such cutoff .",

    "scaling does not hold , however , for the scattered spectra since there are absolute cutoffs ( @xmath20 , @xmath42 ) involved . note also that despite the fact that there is no scattering , the location of the peak photon flux increases above @xmath175  mev as the lifetime is increased .",
    "this is to be expected since as the lifetime @xmath180 , the peak flux should approach @xmath181 since photons that have not been appreciably redshifted ( @xmath182 ) are not exponentially suppressed .",
    "different final state quark pairs give rise to different final spectra .",
    "however , the principle differences between decays into particular final state quark pairs is not difficult to understand . as can be anticipated from the injected ( non - redshifted ) spectra in fig .",
    "[ compare - fig ] , decays into top quark pairs yield the best bound when the lowest energy photons from the injected spectra are sampled .",
    "the decay into top quark pairs gives the largest flux of photons for relics with a large mass @xmath183 at very low present - day energies @xmath184 .",
    "similarly , it is the decay into light quark pairs @xmath157 and @xmath158 that give the largest flux of photons for higher energy photons @xmath185 . without a theoretical motivation for decays into one or another flavor or family , we choose to divide the branching ratio equally among the kinematically available quark pairs .",
    "thus we assign an equal branching ratio for all the pairs ( @xmath186 or @xmath187 depending on whether the @xmath153 threshold has been crossed ) .",
    "the effect of scattering on the spectra , as remarked near the beginning of this section , is not as important for hadronic decays as it is for radiative decays .",
    "in fact , scattering is virtually absent for @xmath169  gev , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hadronic-50 - 400-fig ] where there is no photon flux ( above the lower limit in the graph ) for @xmath188  mev .",

    "photon scattering is possible , and one can see the characteristic limiting behavior of a flat spectra for @xmath188  mev . for @xmath192  gev , pair production dominates the scattered piece of the redshifted spectra @xmath188  mev , albeit with a total integrated energy that is much less than the unscattered piece ( @xmath193  mev ) .",
    "it is really only when @xmath194  tev that the scattered piece of the spectra has a photon flux comparable to the unscattered piece .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the injected photons are below about @xmath150 , which is roughly the scale where scattering turns on .      in fig .",
    "[ hadronic - lifetime - fig ] we have sliced the previous photon flux vs.  photon energy plots along the energy axis in analogy to fig .",

    "[ measurements - sec ] for each photon energy @xmath70 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hadronic - density - fig ] .",
    "we observe , as in the 2-body radiative decays , that the mass dependence shows nontrivial behavior characteristic of the transition between relics whose bounds come the scattered and unscattered spectra respectively , for @xmath194  tev .",
    "in addition , one finds that for shorter lifetimes and larger photon energies the spectra are exponentially suppressed , as can be seen in the lack of a bound for @xmath195  mev and small masses @xmath196  gev .",
    "the physical interpretation is that most of the decays occurred much earlier than our present epoch , so the photon flux is significantly more redshifted than for relics with a longer lifetime .",
    "thus , we see a much smaller number of present - day photons at high energy .    by finding the maximum photon flux above background ( i.e.  one point on each line in each graph of fig .",

    "first , a large range of lifetimes can be excluded for a relic with roughly the critical density .",
    "second , relics with densities considerably _ below _ the critical density are excluded , which places a strong constraint on models with a long lived massive particle .      for relics with roughly the critical density that decay dominantly through a radiative channel ,",
    "the bounds from the diffuse background exclude lifetimes in the range @xmath198 ( using @xmath199  yr ) .",
    "this bound applies to a relic with _ any _ mass @xmath194  mev .",
    "the upper bound on the excluded lifetime of @xmath200  s applies to the worst - case scenario with @xmath201  gev , where the upper bound increases to roughly @xmath202  s for @xmath203  gev and to roughly @xmath204  s for @xmath205  gev .",
    "the upper bounds increase for larger mass relics @xmath206  tev .",
    "the upper bound on the excluded range is near @xmath207  s for small masses @xmath208 .    for relics with roughly the critical density that decay dominantly through hadronic channels ,",
    "the bounds from the diffuse background exclude lifetimes in the range @xmath209 for masses @xmath210  gev .",
    "unlike 2-body decays , the upper bound on the lifetime decreases as the mass of the relic is increased .",
    "this is because for masses beyond @xmath8  tev , an increasing fraction of the photons are scattered into lower energies where the diffuse photon bound is weaker . for masses smaller than @xmath11  gev the upper bound on the lifetime",
    "is roughly similar , but is absent once the mass is below the threshold for pion production .",
    "we have shown that a large range in relic lifetime can be excluded assuming the relic has roughly the critical density .",
    "however , figs .",
    "[ 2-body - bound - fig ] and [ hadronic - bound - fig ] clearly show that the upper limit on the relic density is _ much _ smaller that the critical density by several orders of magnitude .",
    "in particular , models with a long lived particle that does not have the critical density will be excluded if the relic density exceeds our bounds .",
    "the translation of our bounds is relatively straightforward , if most of the relics have not decayed prior to the earliest redshift which we considered , @xmath76 ( that is , if the lifetime is longer than that in ( [ shortest - lifetime - eq ] ) ) .",

    "utilizing the latest observations of the diffuse photon background found from egret and comptel leads to the bounds summarized in figs .",

    ", these bounds establish a fixed upper limit on the relic density of long lived relics .",
    "we find that 3-body hadronic decays typically give better bounds than 2-body radiative decays for the same relic mass despite a larger total energy deposited into the final spectra for the latter decay mode .",
    "the stronger bounds on hadronic decays are a direct result of the low energy photons emitted from the fragmentation process that produces pions which then decay into two photons .",
    "however , strong limits on radiative decays have also been obtained for heavy mass relics since high energy photons are typically scattered by either photon  photon scattering or pair production . in particular , relics with the critical density and the masses considered here that decay dominantly through radiative ( hadronic ) channels are excluded for lifetimes in the range @xmath213  s. the upper bound on the excluded lifetime assumes the worst - case , which is not necessarily the smallest or largest mass . for particular masses or lifetimes , considerably more stringent bounds on the relic density can be read off from figs .",
    "[ 2-body - bound - fig ] , [ hadronic - bound - fig ] .",
    "the existence of strong bounds for both radiative and hadronic decays from the diffuse photon background provides a useful tool for those who consider long lived relics in particular particle physics or cosmological models .",
    "if we assume that the relic has roughly the critical density , then we have seen that the lifetime must be far greater than the age of the universe .",
    "the bounds derived here allow for a more general analysis in that we do not make any assumptions about the number density of the relic .",
    "thus , whether or not the relic is the dark matter , one is still able to put strong constraints on the model",
    ". furthermore , it may be the case that the model under consideration has more than one ( meta-)stable relic , one of which is a dark matter candidate .",
    "such scenarios may arise in cases where there exist symmetries which are only broken by higher dimensional operators .",
    "for instance , in many supersymmetric models it is assumed that r parity is classically conserved . in such cases",
    "one may expect that this symmetry will be broken by gravitational effects leading to very long lived particles which may or may not be dark matter candidates .",
    "bounds in such scenarios were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite using limits from the positron flux in our galaxy for the case of critical density .",
    "these bounds are useful for limiting the values of the couplings involved in the decay , which in general are uncorrelated to all couplings that can be measured in accelerator experiments . however",
    ", if we do not make any assumptions regarding the energy density of the relic then we may constrain couplings that are accessible in collider experiments via a calculation of the relic density .",
    "the relic density may be determined by calculating the annihilation cross section which will be a function of the accessible parameters of the theory .",
    "the drawback to this scenario is that one must make some assumption about what is considered to be unnaturally small for the symmetry breaking couplings .",
