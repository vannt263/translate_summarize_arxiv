    "over the last decade there has been a strong effort  @xcite aimed at seeking experimental evidence of planck - scale ( @xmath1 ) effects which could be motivated from the study of the quantum - gravity problem .",
    "one of the most studied opportunities concerns the possibility that the speed of massless particles ( photons ) might have a planck - scale - induced dependence on wavelength / momentum , as suggested by several preliminary studies in some of the alternative directions of research on quantum gravity ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "this is of particular interest in the context of observations of gamma - ray - bursts where some of the possible scenarios for the form of this momentum ( and planck - scale ) dependence could have observably - large manifestations  @xcite .    from the conceptual perspective",
    "the results and models that shaped this research line have been primarily analyzed for what concerns the fate of lorentz symmetry .",
    "a momentum - dependent speed of photons ( and other particles , when their mass can be neglected ) can evidently be accommodated in scenarios in which lorentz symmetry is  broken \" , violating the relativity of inertial frames  @xcite ( all see , for cases however without momentum dependence of the effect , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . starting with the proposal put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite there has also been growing interest ( also see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) in the possibility that lorentz symmetry might be  deformed \" , preserving the relativity of inertial frames at the  cost \" of modifying the laws of transformation between observers .",
    "we here focus on this deformed - lorentz - symmetry scenario and particularly on the possibility that some viable phenomenological models of this type could be inspired  @xcite by the mathematical structure of the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra@xcite . specifically , we here summarize the results of the studies originally reported in refs .",
    "@xcite where phase - space constructions inspired by @xmath0-poincar were used to formalize the possibility of dependence on momentum of the speed of massless particles which in leading order are linear : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an inverse - momentum deformation scale ( usually thought to be roughly of the order of @xmath4 ) which can take both positive or negative values ( in the sense that one can contemplate both models with @xmath5 and models with @xmath6 ) , and it is assumed that ( [ velocitydsr ] ) would hold for @xmath7 .",
    "besides the momentum dependence of the speed of photons we shall also put in focus the implications that the relevant deformations of lorentz symmetry have for the relativity of spacetime locality  @xcite .",
    "we shall do this first , on the basis of refs .",
    "@xcite , in setups which are confined to the description of free particles , and then , in the part that summarizes the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall describe interacting particles within the  relative - locality framework \" proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is centered on the geometry of momentum space .",
    "we work throughout at leading order in the deformation scale .",
    "this keeps formulas at reasonably manageable level , sufficiently characterizes the new concepts , and would be fully sufficient for phenomenology if indeed the deformation scale is roughly of the order of the huge planck scale ( in which case a leading - order analysis should be all we need for comparison to data we could realistically imagine to gather over the next few decades ) . + some of the results are also discussed specifically for 1 + 1-dimensional cases , where all conceptual issues here relevant are already present and can be exposed more simply .",
    "the notion of deformed lorentz symmetry which we shall here adopt is the one of the proposal  dsr \" (  doubly - special \" , or  deformed - special \" , relativity ) , first introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . + this proposal was put forward as a possible description of theory results suggesting that there be violations of some special - relativistic laws in certain approaches to the quantum - gravity problem , most notably the ones based on spacetime noncommutativity and loop quantum gravity . the part of the quantum - gravity community interested in those results was interpreting them as a manifestation of a full breakdown of lorentz symmetry , with the emergence of a preferred class of observers ( an  ether \" ) .",
    "but it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that departures from special relativity governed by a high - energy / short - distance scale may well be compatible with the relativity principle , the principle of relativity of inertial observers , at the cost of allowing some consistent modifications of relativistic kinematics and of the poincar / lorentz transformations .    the main area of investigation of the dsr proposal has been for the last decade the possibility of introducing relativistically some planck - scale - deformed on - shell relations .",
    "the dsr proposal was put forward  @xcite as a conceptual path for pursuing a broader class of scenarios of interest for fundamental physics , including the possibility of introducing the second observer - independent scale primitively in spacetime structure or primitively at the level of the ( deformed ) de broglie relation between wavelength and momentum . however , the bulk of the preliminary results providing encouragement for this approach came from quantum - gravity research concerning planck - scale departures from the special - relativistic on - shell relation , and this in turn became the main focus of dsr research .",
    "this idea of deformed lorentz symmetry is actually very simple , as we shall here render manifest on the basis of an analogy with how the poincar transformations came to be adopted as a deformation of galileo transformations .",
    "famously , as the maxwell formulation of electromagnetism , with an observer - independent speed scale  @xmath8 \" , gained more and more experimental support ( among which we count the michelson - morley results ) it became clear that galilean relativistic symmetries could no longer be upheld . from a modern perspective",
    "we should see the pre - einsteinian attempts to address that crisis ( such as the ones of lorentz ) as attempts to  break galilean invariance \" , _",
    "i.e. _ preserve the validity of galilean transformations as laws of transformation among inertial observers , but renouncing to the possibility that those transformations be a symmetry of the laws of physics .",
    "the  ether \" would be a preferred frame for the description of the laws of physics , and the laws of physics that hold in other frames would be obtained from the ones of the preferred frame via galilean transformations . + those attempts failed .",
    "what succeeded is completely complementary .",
    "experimental evidence , and the analyses of einstein ( and poincar ) led us to a ",
    "deformation of galilean invariance \" : in special relativity the laws of transformation among observers still are a symmetry of the laws of physics ( special relativity is no less relativistic than galilean relativity ) , but the special - relativistic transformation laws are a @xmath8-deformation of the galilean laws of transformation with the special property of achieving the observer - independence of the speed scale @xmath8 .",
    "this famous @xmath8-deformation in particular replaces the galilean on - shell relation @xmath9 with the special - relativistic version @xmath10 and the galilean composition of velocities @xmath11 with the special relativistic law of composition of velocities @xmath12 where as usual @xmath13 .",
    "+ the richness of the velocity - composition ( [ ungarvel ] ) is a necessary match for the demanding task of introducing an absolute scale in a relativistic theory . and",
    "it is unfortunate that undergraduate textbooks often choose to limit the discussion to the special case of ( [ ungarvel ] ) which applies when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are collinear : @xmath16 the invariance of the velocity scale @xmath8 of course requires that boosts act non - linearly on velocity space , and this is visible not only in ( [ ungarvel ] ) but also in ( [ veltextbook ] ) . but also the non - commutativity and non - associativity of ( [ ungarvel ] ) ( which are silenced in ( [ veltextbook ] ) ) play a central role  @xcite in the logical consistency of special relativity as a theory enforcing relativistically the absoluteness of the speed scale @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the composition law ( [ ungarvel ] ) encodes thomas - wigner rotations , and in turn the relativity of simultaneity .",
    "equipped with this quick reminder of some features of the transition from galilean relativity to special relativity we can now quickly summarize the logical ingredients of a dsr framework .",
    "the analogy is particularly close in cases where the dsr - deformation of lorentz symmetry is introduced primitively at the level of the on - shell relation . to see this",
    "let us consider an on - shell relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the deformation and @xmath3 is the deformation scale .",
    "evidently when @xmath19 such an on - shell relation ( [ dsr1gen ] ) is not lorentz invariant . if we insist on this law and on the validity of classical ( undeformed ) lorentz transformations between inertial observers we clearly end up with a preferred - frame picture , and the principle of relativity of inertial frames must be abandoned : the scale @xmath3 can not be observer independent , and actually the whole form of ( [ dsr1gen ] ) is subject to vary from one class of inertial observers to another .",
    "+ the other option  @xcite in such cases is the dsr option of enforcing the relativistic invariance of ( [ dsr1gen ] ) , preserving the relativity of inertial frames , at the cost of modifying the action of boosts on momenta .",
    "then in such theories both the velocity scale @xmath8 ( here mute only because of the choice of dimensions ) and the energy scale @xmath3 play the same role  @xcite of invariant scales of the relativistic theory which govern the form of boost transformations .",
    "+ several examples of boost deformations adapted in the dsr sense to modified on - shell relations have been analyzed in some detail ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . clearly these dsr - deformed boosts @xmath20 must be such that they admit the deformed shell , @xmath21 , as an invariant , and in turn the law of composition of momenta must also be deformed  @xcite , @xmath22 , since it must be covariant  @xcite under the action of the ( dsr - deformed ) boost transformations .",
    "+ all this is evidently analogous to corresponding aspects of galilean relativity and special relativity : of course in all these cases the on - shell relation is boost invariant ( but respectively under galilean boosts , lorentz boosts , and dsr - deformed lorentz boosts ) ; for special relativity the action of boosts evidently must depend on the speed scale @xmath8 and must act non - linearly on velocities ( since it must enforce observer independence of @xmath8-dependent laws ) , and for dsr relativity the action of boosts evidently must depend on both the speed scale @xmath8 and the scale @xmath3 , acting non - linearly both on velocities and momenta , since it must enforce observer independence of @xmath8-dependent and @xmath3-dependent laws ( the scale @xmath3 is endowed in dsr with properties that are completely analogous to the familiar properties of @xmath8 ; dsr - relativistic theories have both @xmath8 and @xmath3 as relativistic - invariant scales ) .",
    "let us start , in this section , by summarizing the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a relativistic description of momentum dependence of the speed of massless particles was given within a classical - phase - space construction inspired by properties of the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra  @xcite .",
    "+ at the quantum level the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra is intimately related to the @xmath0-minkowski noncommutative spacetime  @xcite , on which we shall return later .",
    "but for classical - phase - space constructions one can consider standard minkowski spacetime coordinates in combination with a description of relativistic transformations inspired by properties of the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra .",
    "so in this section we assume trivial poisson brackets for the spacetime coordinates , @xmath23 .",
    "actually ref .",
    "@xcite analyzed a 3-parameter family of phase spaces suitable for a dsr - relativistic implementation of the speed law ( [ velocitydsr ] ) .",
    "but in order to highlight the possible connection with the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra we here specialize to the case involving the following description of the boost and translation generators in a 1 + 1-dimensional context : @xmath24 which is inspired by the so - called  @xmath0-poincar bicrossproduct basis \" introduced in ref .",
    "+ from ( [ poinca ] ) one sees that the on - shell relation must be of the form  @xcite @xmath25    following again ref .  @xcite we derive the worldlines within a hamiltonian setup .",
    "one starts introducing canonical momenta conjugate to the coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28",
    "the on - shell relation @xmath29 then will play the role of hamiltonian .",
    "hamilton s equations give the conservation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 along the worldlines @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is an auxiliary worldline parameter .",
    "the worldlines can then be obtained observing that @xmath35 eliminating the parameter @xmath34 and imposing the hamiltonian constraint @xmath36 ( massless case ) one finds that @xmath37 which reproduces ( [ velocitydsr ] ) in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the compatibility between boost transformations and form of the on - shell relation is encoded in the requirement that the boost charge is conserved @xmath39 this leads us to adopt the following representation of boosts @xmath40 the dsr - relativistic covariance of this setup , ensured by construction , can also be verified by computing explicitly  @xcite the action of an infinitesimal deformed boost with rapidity vector @xmath41 @xmath42 using these one easily verifies that when alice has the particle on the worldline ( [ fullworldlines ] ) bob sees the particle on the worldline @xmath43 consistently with the ( dsr-)relativistic nature of the framework .",
    "our next task is to summarize the evidence , first noticed indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that dsr - relativistic properties of the type illustrated by this phase - space construction may lead to the novel notion of a  relativity of spacetime locality \" .",
    "+ relativistically , as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the absoluteness of locality is codified in the fact that when one observer established that two events coincide then all other observers agree that the two events coincide .",
    "+ it had been known for several years  @xcite that a revision of the notion of locality is necessary in dsr - relativistic frameworks with momentum - dependent speed of massless particles . but a logically consistent picture did not arise until the study of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the needed revision of locality does not take the form of a total breakdown of locality , but rather just the weakening of locality that intervenes in going from an absolute - locality picture to a picture in which locality is a relativistic notion , assessed relatively to a given observer .",
    "+ we shall now summarize some of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite which characterize this novel notion .",
    "but before we do that let us remind our readers of the analogy they should notice with the emergence of relative simultaneity in special relativity . in galilean relativity all velocities are relative and time is absolute . and",
    "it is well establish that the fact that special relativity introduce an absolute velocity scale @xmath8 came at the cost of rendering simultaneity relative .",
    "it is therefore not surprising if a dsr - relativistic framework , now endowing also to the momentums scale @xmath44 with the role of absolute scale then must pay the price of rendering something relative , and this is where the relativity of locality is relevant .",
    "a quick and efficient characterization of the relativity of spacetime locality is obtained using the derivation of worldlines discussed above to obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "( violet ) , and one with momentum @xmath45 ( blue ) . according to alice ( whose lines are solid , while boosted bob has dashed lines )",
    "three of the worldlines give a distant coincidence of events , while two of the worldlines cross in the origin.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in figure we simply characterize  events \" as crossings of worldlines ( or crossing or a particle worldline with the worldline of an observer ) . as shown by two of the worldlines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when an observer alice is local to a coincidence of events ( _ i.e. _ there are two events both occurring in the origin of her coordinate system ) all observers that are purely boosted with respect to alice , and therefore share her origin of the coordinate system , will also describe those two events as coincident .",
    "so in our dsr framework one finds that locality , a coincidence of events , preserves its objectivity if assessed by a nearby observer .",
    "the element of nonlocality that is actually produced by dsr - deformed boosts is seen by focusing on the  burst \" of three photon worldlines also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , whose crossings establish a coincidence of events for alice far from her origin , an aspect of locality encoded in a",
    " distant coincidence of events \" .",
    "the objectivity of such distant coincidences of events is partly spoiled by the dsr deformation : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the coincidence is only approximately present in the coordinates of an observer boosted with respect to alice .",
    "we should however stress that even the distant coincidence is objective up to a very good approximation if indeed @xmath44 is of the order of the planck scale ( corresponding to the planck length @xmath46 ) .",
    "on terrestrial scales one might imagine hypothetically to observe a certain particle decay with two laboratories , with a large relative boost of , say , @xmath47 , with idealized absolute accuracy in tracking back to the decay region the worldlines of two particles that are the decay products .",
    "as one easily checks from ( [ ttra])-([xtra ] ) the peculiar sort of departures from absolute locality that is codified in the  relativity of spacetime locality \" which we just described has magnitude governed by @xmath48 . therefore even if the distance @xmath49 between decay region and observers if of , say , @xmath50 and the decay products have momenta of , say , @xmath51 , one ends up with an apparent nonlocality of the decay region which is of only @xmath52 .",
    "going beyond terrestrial scales another context where estimates might be interesting is the one of a typical observation of a gamma - ray burst , with particles of @xmath53 momenta that travel for , say , @xmath54 before reaching our telescopes .",
    "in such a context , for two satellite - telescopes with a relative boost of , say , @xmath55 , the loss of coincidence of events at the source is of order @xmath56 , well below the sharpness we are able to attribute to the location of a gamma - ray burst .",
    "we should also stress that actually in such a dsr framework two relatively boosted observers should not dwell about distant coincidences , but rather express all observables in terms of local measurements ( which is anyway what should be done in a relativistic theory ) .",
    "for example , for the burst of three photons shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "the momentum dependence of the speed of photons is objectively manifest ( manifest both for alice and bob ) in the linear correlation between arrival times and momentum of the photons ( which we highlight in a panel contained in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
