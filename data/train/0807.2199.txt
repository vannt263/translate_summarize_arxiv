    "@xmath0-geometry is a generalization of variation of hodge structures .",
    "it appeared first in papers of cecotti and vafa ( @xcite ) .",
    "their work connects to singularity theory through landau - ginzburg models . here",
    "the @xmath0-geometry is defined by oscillating integrals of tame algebraic functions and a careful handling of the underlying real structure , which leads to antiholomorphic data .",
    "a formalization of this construction was given in @xcite , where the basic object is a twistor , i.e. , a vector bundle on @xmath1 , with some additional structure , namely , a flat connection with poles of order 2 at 0 and @xmath2 .",
    "such a twistor is is a holomorphic object , however , a family ( or variation ) of it over some parameter space is not .",
    "the tame functions in landau - ginzburg models have isolated singularities , and the local geometry of these singularities has been studied for almost 40 years .",
    "the transcendental data of these germs of functions , i.e. , gau - manin connection , brieskorn lattice and the polarized mixed hodge structure of steenbrink and varchenko fit very well into the new framework provided by @xmath0-geometry . in the case of germs of functions , it is possible to imitate oscillating integrals by a fourier - laplace transformation .",
    "the holomorphic theory of oscillating integrals for global tame functions had been studied by pham and , more recently , by sabbah and douai ( @xcite ) .",
    "sabbah also recovered a basic positivity result of cecotti and vafa for that case ( @xcite , see also theorem [ theotamepurepolarized ] ) .    a second ,",
    "even older starting point is the work of simpson on harmonic bundles and twistors ( @xcite ) , although the notion of harmonic bundles is slightly weaker .",
    "his work has been continued and generalized by sabbah ( @xcite ) and mochizuki ( @xcite ) in sabbah s notion of polarized twistor @xmath3-modules .",
    "mochizuki proved results which generalize to a large extent schmid s work on variations of hodge structures , nilpotent orbits and limit mixed hodge structures .",
    "the theory of singularities of local and global functions lies at the crossroad of all these developments . in this survey",
    "we concentrate on the local functions ( this is referred to as the regular singular case later on ) .",
    "we show how the work of schmid and mochizuki applies , we discuss nilpotent orbits , classifying spaces and ( limits of ) period maps .",
    "the main references for the material covered here are the articles @xcite and @xcite",
    ". we will give precise definitions and complete statements for all the results presented , but almost no proofs for which we refer to the above papers .",
    "here is a short outline of the contents of this survey . in the next two sections , we recall classical material : the basic definition and properties of brieskorn lattices of isolated hypersurface singularities and tame functions on affine varieties , their fourier - laplace transformation , and how to construct ( variation of ) twistor structures from them ( along with the definition of the latter ) .",
    "an axiomatic framework for the various types of brieskorn lattices is given under the name terp - structure ( an abbreviation for `` twistor '' , `` extension '' , `` real structure '' and `` pairing '' ) .",
    "section [ secnilpotent ] discusses the relation between ( polarized ) twistor structures and ( polarized mixed ) hodge structures defined by filtrations associated to a brieskorn lattice .",
    "the next two sections ( [ secclassifying ] and [ seccompact ] ) investigate the twistor geometry on classifying spaces of brieskorn lattices ( resp .",
    "terp - structures ) .",
    "these spaces were constructed in order to study torelli theorems for so - called @xmath4-constant families of singularities .",
    "we give a result on the curvature of the hermitian metric induced on them .",
    "moreover , we construct partial compactifications of these spaces on which the above metrics are complete .",
    "this allows us to deduce some results known for variations of hodge structures in the case of terp / twistor - structures using standard techniques from complex hyperbolic analysis .",
    "finally , the last section discusses period mappings for hypersurface singularities , mainly for families over a punctured disc , and their behaviour at the boundary point @xmath5 .",
    "we show some consequences of mochizuki s construction of a limit polarized mixed twistor and give statements analogues to those obtained for variations of hodge structures .",
    "we will give here a very brief reminder on the theory of brieskorn lattices arising from isolated hypersurface singularities or polynomial functions .",
    "the goal is to motivate the constructions in the later sections , and to provide the main class of examples .",
    "consider first the classical situation of a germ of a holomorphic function @xmath6 with an isolated critical point . by choosing appropriate representatives @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , this function germ yields a mapping @xmath11 with the property that its restriction to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , is a locally trivial fibration , called the milnor fibration .",
    "its fibres are homotopic to a bouquet of @xmath4 spheres of ( real ) dimension @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the milnor number ; here @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 is a local system , in other words , the sheaf @xmath18 defines a holomorphic bundle with a flat connection @xmath19 .",
    "it was brieskorn s idea to consider extensions of @xmath20 over the whole of @xmath8 .",
    "consider the following three sheaves and mappings between them : @xmath21 ( note that these are not brieskorn s original notations ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is the natural inclusion and @xmath23 .",
    "all of them are @xmath24-locally free and restrict to @xmath25 on @xmath26 .",
    "the quotients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are isomorphic to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , in particular , supported on @xmath31 and of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "define differential operators @xmath32 where @xmath33 is such that @xmath34 , and where @xmath35 is the coordinate on @xmath8 .",
    "these give an extension of the topological connection @xmath19 on @xmath25 and define meromorphic connections with a regular singularity at @xmath31 on @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , because @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is minimal with @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , both are isomorphisms of @xmath43-vector spaces .",
    "in particular , the inverse @xmath44 is well - defined on @xmath45 and moreover , the germ @xmath45 is free of rank @xmath4 over the ring @xmath46 of microdifferential operators with constant coefficients .",
    "the most interesting of the three extensions is @xmath38 , mainly because @xmath47 is a line bundle , so for fixed coordinates , we may represent elements in @xmath38 by ( classes of ) functions .",
    "@xmath38 is called the * brieskorn lattice * of the function germ @xmath48 .    in most of the applications ,",
    "one is interested in the case of families of function germs .",

    "a result of gabrielov , lazzeri and l shows that then the only critical point of @xmath70 is the origin of @xmath71 .",
    "these families are called `` @xmath4-constant deformations '' of @xmath67 .",
    "the second class of objects we are interested in is closely related to these function germs , but in this case phenomena of a more global nature occur .",
    "we start with a smooth affine manifold @xmath7 and we want to study regular functions @xmath72 . there is a condition one needs to impose in order to make sure that no change of topology is caused by singularities at infinity ( of a partial compactification @xmath73 ) .",

    "the next step is to define the fourier - laplace transformation of the brieskorn lattice .",
