    "in spite of the growing recognition that physics skills ",
    "`` scholastic rigor , analytical thinking , quantitative assessment , and the analysis of complex systems '' @xcite  are important for biology @xcite and pre - medical @xcite students , these students often arrive in physics classes skeptical about the relevance of physics to their academic and professional goals . to engage these students , in the 2010 - 2011 academic year ,",
    "the yale physics department debuted a new introductory physics sequence , that , in addition to covering the basics ",
    "kinematics , force , energy , momentum , hooke s law , ohm s law , maxwell s equations _ etc . _",
    " also covers a number of more biologically - relevant topics , including , in particular , probability , random walks , and the boltzmann factor .",
    "the point of view of the class is that the essential aspect of physics is that it constitutes a mathematical description of the natural world , irrespective of whether the topic is planetary motion or cellular motion .",
    "the enrollment in the new sequence was approximately 100 students .",
    "the class is evenly split between sophomores and juniors with a few seniors .",
    "the majority ( 80% ) are biology majors , with 80% identifying themselves as premedical students , and they possess considerable biological sophistication . in many cases ,",
    "they are involved in biomedical research at yale or at the yale school of medicine . in many cases too , they are involved in medically - related volunteer work .",
    "the major time commitment required to do justice to a rigorous physics class has to compete with these other obligations .",
    "therefore , an important aspect of our teaching strategy is to convince these students that physics is indeed relevant to their goals . to this end",
    ", we determined to cover a number of biologically - relevant topics , with which the majority of the students would have some familiarity from their earlier biology and chemistry classes .",
    "this paper presents three such topics , that are interrelated and can be treated as random walks , in the hope that these may be useful to others .",
    "first is dna melting @xcite , which we place in the context of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .",
    "this provides a way to illustrate the role of the boltzmann factor in a venue well - known to the students .",
    "this treatment builds on earlier sections of the course , concerned with random walks and chemical reaction rates , which are not described here .",
    "the second topic is the activity of helicase motor proteins in unzipping double - stranded nucleic acid ( dna or rna , although we will write in terms of dna ) .",
    "our discussion is based on ref . .",
    "helicase activity constitutes an elegant example of a brownian ratchet and builds on the earlier discussion of dna melting .",
    "third , we present a discussion of force generation by actin polymerization , which provides the physical basis of cell motility in many cases , and which is another brownian ratchet . in this case , based on ref . , we can determine how the velocity of actin polymerization depends on actin concentration and on load .",
    "in each of these examples , biology and pre - medical students in an introductory physics class see that a physics - based approach permits a new , deeper understanding of a familiar molecular - biological phenomenon .",
    "`` the laws of thermodynamics may easily be obtained from the principles of statistical mechanics , of which they are an incomplete expression . ''",
    "gibbs @xcite .    instead of introducing thermal phenomena via thermodynamics and heat engines ,",
    "as might occur in a traditional introductory sequence , following the suggestion of garcia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we chose to assert the boltzmann factor as the fundamental axiom of thermal physics .",
    "building upon earlier sections of the course on probability and random walks , this approach permits us to rapidly progress to physics - based treatments of dna melting , unzipping of double - stranded dna at the replication fork by helicase motor proteins , and force - generation by actin - polymerization . specifically , we assert that , for microstates @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a system , the probability ( @xmath2 ) of realizing a microstate @xmath0 and the probability ( @xmath3 ) of realizing a microstate @xmath1 are related via @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy of microstate @xmath0 , @xmath6 is the energy of microstate @xmath1 , @xmath7  jk@xmath8 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath9 is the absolute temperature .    `` this fundamental law is the summit of statistical mechanics , and the entire subject is either the slide - down from this summit , as the principle is applied to various cases , or the climb up to where the fundamental law is derived and the concepts of thermal equilibrium and temperature clarified .",
    "'' r. p. feynman on the boltzmann factor @xcite .    to illustrate the boltzmann factor in a simple example , we consider protein folding / unfolding .",
    "protein / unfolding is an example of an isomerization reaction , in which one chemical species alternates between different molecular configurations . in this case , it is important to realize that the folded state corresponds to a single microstate , but that the unfolded state corresponds to @xmath10 microstates .",
    "this is because there is just one molecular configuration associated with the folded state .",
    "by contrast , the unfolded state can be viewed as a random walk in space , and therefore corresponds to @xmath10 different molecular configurations , one for each different random walk .",
    "if there are a total of @xmath11 proteins , @xmath12 of which are unfolded , and if there are @xmath10 possible unfolded microstates , then the probability of realizing a particular unfolded microstate ( @xmath13 ) is equal to the probability that a protein molecule is unfolded multipled by the probability that an unfolded protein is in the particular unfolded microstate of interest , which is one of @xmath10 equally - likely microstates : @xmath14 there is a unique folded microstate , so in terms of @xmath11 and the number of folded proteins , @xmath15 , the probability of realizing the folded microstate is simply @xmath16 combining eq . [ bf ] , eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , and eq . [ eq3 ] , we find @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy of any of the unfolded states and @xmath19 is the energy of the folded state .",
    "next , we examine dna melting , according to the model of ref . , in which dna melting is equivalent to dna unzipping .",
    "we treat dna zipping and unzipping as a set of isomerization reactions . to this end , we consider a population of identical dna strands each of which contains a junction between dsdna and ssdna .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the reactions involving the dna strand with @xmath0 paired base pairs .",
    "this is the chemical species in the center .",
    "the species on the left and right are dna strands with @xmath20 and @xmath21 paired base pairs , respectively .",
    "the relevant reaction rates are @xmath22 , which is the zipping rate , and @xmath23 , which is the unzipping rate .",
    "when @xmath24 , the dna zips up .",
    "when @xmath25 , the dna unzips . as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath26 is the mean number of dna strands with @xmath0 paired base pairs , _ etc .",
    "_     zipped base pairs are illustrated , either undergoing isomerization to a dna strand with @xmath27 base pairs or isomerization to a dna strand with @xmath28 base pairs.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    we have previously discussed in class that how the concentration of chemical species changes in time can be described by chemical rate equations . with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we are thus lead to an equation for the rate of change of @xmath26 in terms of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath26 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 : @xmath31 at equilibrium , at a temperature @xmath9 , on - average nothing changes as a function of time , so @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33    the factor @xmath34 , which is the ratio of the mean number of dna strands with @xmath21 zipped base pairs to the mean number with @xmath0 zipped base pairs , is equal to the ratio of the probability that a particular dna strand has @xmath21 zipped base pairs to the probability that it has @xmath0 zipped base pairs .",
    "thus , this factor is given by a boltzmann factor ( _ cf . _ eq .",
    "[ xxx ] ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy required to unzip one additional base pair ( so @xmath36 is positive ) and @xmath10 specifies that the two unzipped ssdna bases have a factor @xmath10 times as many microstates as the single dsdna base pair they replace .",
    "the last equality in eq .",
    "[ zip1 ] defines the free energy required to unzip one base pair : @xmath37 students are familar with @xmath38 from their chemistry classes .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath39    substituting eq . [ zip1 ] and eq . [ zip2 ] into eq . [ steadystate2 ] , we have @xmath40 it follows from eq . [ steadystate3 ]",
    "that @xmath41 eq . [ dg ] informs us that the dna unzips ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath42 , only if @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ only if @xmath44 .",
    "in order for this condition ( @xmath44 ) to be satisfied , it is necessary that @xmath45 .",
    "if we define the dna `` melting temperature '' to be @xmath46 , we see that the dna unzips for @xmath47 , while it zips up for @xmath48 .",
    "this phenomenon is an essential ingredient in dna multiplication by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , which is well - known to the students , and for which kary mullis won the 1993 nobel prize in chemistry @xcite .",
    "the first step in pcr is to raise the temperature above @xmath49 , so that each dsdna strand unzips to become two ssdna strands .",
    "when the temperature is subsequently reduced in the presence of oligonucleotide primers , nucleotides and dna polymerase , each previously - unzipped , ssdna strand templates its own conversion to dsdna .",
    "this doubles the original number of dsdna strands because a new dsdna strand is created for each ssdna .",
    "pcr involves repeating this temperature cycling process multiple ( @xmath50 ) times , with the result that the initial number of dsdna molecules is multiplied by a factor of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , initially tiny quantities of dsdna can be hugely amplified , and subsequently sequenced .",
    "it is also instructive to view dna zipping / unzipping as a biased random walk , which students have previously studied in the class . in this context , if we consider a dsdna - ssdna junction , the probability of zipping up one base pair in a time @xmath52 is @xmath53 , and the probability of unzipping one base pair in a time @xmath52 is @xmath54 . for small enough @xmath52 it is reasonable to assume that the only three possibilities are ( 1 ) to zip up one base pair or ( 2 ) to unzip one base pair or ( 3 ) to not do anything",
    "therefore , since probabilities sum to unity , we must have that the probability to do nothing is @xmath55 .",
    "given these probabilities , and the length of a base pair , @xmath56 , we may readily calculate the mean displacement of the ssdna - dsdna junction in a time @xmath52 : @xmath57 where zipping corresponds to a negative displacement of the ss - to - ds junction since the mean of the sum of @xmath11 identically - distributed , statistically - independent random variables is @xmath11 times the mean of one of them ( which students learned earlier in the course ) , then in a time @xmath58 the mean displacement of the ssdna - dsdna junction is @xmath59 the corresponding drift velocity of the ssdna - dsdna junction is @xmath60 this is the drift velocity of a dsdna - ssdna junction in terms of the zipping up rate ( @xmath22 ) and the unzipping rate ( @xmath23 ) , or the zipping rate ( @xmath22 ) and the unzipping free energy ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we will come back to this result below , but we note now that eq .",
    "[ vj ] is appropriate only when the junction is far from a helicase .    as defined in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , @xmath38 is the change in free energy that occurs when one additional base pair is unzipped .",
    "thus , as far as this expression for @xmath38 is concerned , the final , `` product '' state is the unzipped state , and the initial , `` reactant '' state is the zipped state .",
    "thus , unzipping corresponds to the forward direction of the reaction .",
    "we may make contact with what students have learned in chemistry classes , namely that a reaction proceeds forward if @xmath38 is negative , by pointing out that eq .",
    "[ vj ] informs us that the unzipping reaction proceeds forwards ( _ i.e. _ that @xmath61 ) only for @xmath43 , exactly as we are told in chemistry classes . here",
    ", though , this result is derived from a more basic principle , namely the boltzmann factor .",
    "helicases @xcite are a class of motor proteins ( a.k.a . molecular motors ) , which perform myriad tasks in the cell by catalyzing atp - to - adp hydrolysis and using the free energy released in this reaction to do work .",
    "the importance of helicases may be judged from the fact that 4% of the yeast genome codes for some kind of helicase .",
    "one of their roles is to unzip dsdna and/or dsrna .",
    "thus , helicases play an indispensible role in dna replication , for example . to engage students in this topic , we start by showing a number of online movies illustrating the dna - unzipping activity of helicase motor proteins at the replication fork @xcite",
    ". these movies also present an opportunity for active learning in which we ask students to discuss with their neighbors what is misleading about the videos .",
    "the essential point is that , wonderful as they are , the videos suggest that everything proceeds deterministically .",
    "by contrast , as we will discuss , all of the processes depicted are actually random walks , but with a drift velocity that corresponds to their progress .",
    "we also point out that , on the medical side , werner syndrome , which involves accelerated aging , is caused by a mutation in the _ wrn _ gene which codes for the helicase wrn @xcite .",
    "one proposed mechanism for how helicase unzips dna is as follows .",
    "the helicase steps unimpeded on ssdna towards a ss - to - ds junction , until it encounters the junction , which then blocks its further progress , because the helicase translocates only on ssdna . however , at the junction , there is a non - zero probability per unit time for the junction to thermally unzip one base pair , because of the boltzmann factor .",
    "it is then possible for the helicase to step into the just - unzipped position .",
    "if the helicase does this , the dna is prevented from subsequently zipping back up again . in this way ,",
    "the junction is unzipped one step .",
    "repeating this process many times leads to the complete unzipping of the dna . because this mechanism relies on random brownian motions to both unzip the dna and to move the helicase into the just - unzipped position ,",
    "the helicase is said to be a brownian ratchet @xcite , analogous to feynman s thermal ratchet @xcite .      just as the motion of the ss - to - ds junction may be conceived as a random walk , so may be the translocation of the helicase on ssdna . in this case , the probability of the helicase stepping one base pair towards the junction ( @xmath62 ) in a time @xmath52 is @xmath63 , and the probability stepping one base pair away from the junction ( @xmath64 ) in a time @xmath52 is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the rate of stepping towards the junction and the rate of stepping away from the junction , respectively . since probabilities sum to unity , and we assume that the only three possibilities in a small time @xmath52 are to step towards the junction one base pair or to step away from the junction one base pair or to not do anything , we must have that the probability to do nothing is @xmath68 . given these probabilities , and the length of a base pair , @xmath56",
    ", we may calculate the mean displacement of the helicase in a time @xmath52 : @xmath69 since the mean of the sum of @xmath11 identically - distributed , statistically - independent random variables is @xmath11 times the mean of one of them , then in a time @xmath58 the mean displacement of the helicase is @xmath70 the corresponding drift velocity of the helicase is @xmath71 this is the drift velocity of a helicase in terms of the stepping - towards - the - junction rate ( @xmath66 ) and the stepping - away - from - the - junction rate ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "just like eq",
    ". [ vj ] , eq .",
    "[ vh ] is appropriate only when the helicase is far from the junction .",
    "-direction to increase towards the right , so that @xmath22 and @xmath67 correspond to motion in the negative @xmath72-direction , and @xmath23 and @xmath66 correspond to motion in the positive @xmath72-direction.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    an important additional point , concerning helicase translocation on ssdna , is that , as we saw in eq .",
    "[ dg ] , the ratio of forward and backward rates is given by a change in free energy .",
    "thus , for helicase stepping we must expect , in analogy with eq .",
    "[ dg ] , that the ratio of stepping rates is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a free energy change .",
    "but what free energy change ?",
    "the answer can be gleaned from the observation that helicases , and motor proteins generally , can be thought of as enzymes , which catalyze atp - to - adp hydrolysis , which is coupled to the helicase s translocation .",
    "it follows that @xmath74 in eq .",
    "[ dgprime ] corresponds to the free energy difference between atp and adp .",
    "( note that @xmath74 , as specified in eq .",
    "[ dgprime ] , must be positive , in order to ensure that @xmath75 so that the helicase translocates on ssdna preferentially towards the ssdna - to - dsdna junction . )",
    "so far , we have considered the situtation when the ds - to - ss junction and the helicase are far apart . to determine how helicase unzips dsdna , it is necessary to determine what happens when these two objects come into close proximity , given that they can not cross each other . to elucidate what happens in this case , we show to the class a simple mathematic demonstration that simulates these two non - crossing random walks @xcite .",
    "the simulation treats both the location of the helicase and the location of the ds - to - ss junction as random walks . at each time step within the simulation ,",
    "the helicase ordinarily steps in the positive @xmath72-direction , towards the junction , with probability @xmath63 and in the negative @xmath72-direction , away from the junction , with probability @xmath76 , while the junction ordinarily steps in the positive @xmath72-direction , zipping up one step , with probability @xmath53 and in the negative @xmath72-direction , unzipping one step , with probability @xmath54 .",
    "however , in the simulation , if the helicase and the junction are neighbors , neither one is permitted to step to where it would overlap with the other .",
    "thus , the helicase and the junction can not cross .",
    "an example of the simulational results is shown in fig .",
    "[ titans ] , where the orange trace represents helicase location as a function of time and the green trace represents the location of the ssdna - to - dsdna junction as a function of time . evidently , the helicase and the junction track together , implying that they have the same drift velocity . for the parameters of this simulation ,",
    "the helicase translocates in the same direction as it would in the absence of the junction .",
    "by contrast , the junction s direction is opposite its direction without the helicase . thus , for these parameters , the helicase indeed unzips dsdna . using sliders within the mathematica demonstration , which is readily accessed via any web browser",
    ", students can explore for themselves the effects of varying @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .     and @xmath77 .",
    "the green random walk represents the position of a ssdna - to - dsdna junction for @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in both cases , @xmath80 .",
    "the blue line is eq .",
    "the two random walks start at 0 in the case of the junction , and at -2 in the case of the helicase .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    to incorporate analytically the fact that the helicase and the junction can not cross , we introduce the probability , @xmath81 , that the helicase and the junction are not next to each other . the dsdna - to - ssdna junction can only zip up if the helicase and the junction are not next to each other .",
    "therefore , we reason that eq . [ dxj ]",
    "should be modified to read @xmath82 similarly , eq .",
    "[ dxh ] should be modified to read @xmath83 it follows that the drift velocities are modified to read @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "however , from the simulation , it is also clear that , while the helicase is unzipping dna , the helicase and the junction must have the same drift velocity _ i.e. _ @xmath86 or @xmath87 we can solve this equation to determine @xmath81 : @xmath88 furthermore , we can use this expression for @xmath81 to determine the drift velocity at which the helicase unzips the dsdna by substituting into eq .",
    "[ vh2 ] . setting @xmath89",
    ", we find @xmath90 eq . [ vvv ] represents the velocity at which helicase unzips dsdna according to the brownian ratchet mechanism .",
    "the numerator in eq .",
    "[ vvv ] is the difference of two rate ratios .",
    "it follows , using eq .",
    "[ dg ] and eq .",
    "[ dgprime ] in eq .",
    "[ vvv ] , that @xmath91 eq .",
    "[ vvvv ] informs us that whether or not helicase unzips dsdna depends solely on whether @xmath92 or not . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the drift velocity of the helicase - plus - junction is positive , corresponding to the helicase unzipping the dsdna .",
    "for one base pair , we have @xmath93 , while for the hydrolysis of one atp molecule , we have @xmath94 , so indeed the helicase has plenty of free energy to do its work .",
    "in fact , energetically , one atp hydrolysis cycle could unzip up to about 5 base pairs .",
    "in fact , beautiful , single - helicase experiments @xcite suggest that the simple brownian ratchet mechanism of helicase dna - unzipping activity , presented here , should be refined by incorporating both a softer repulsive potential between the helicase and the ds - to - ss junction than the hard - wall potential implicit in our discussion , and suitable free energy barriers between different microstates of the helicase and junction @xcite .",
    "appropriate choices of the potential and the barriers permit the helicase to unzip dsdna faster than would occur in the case of a hard - wall potential . a force ( @xmath95 ) , that tends to unzip the dna ,",
    "can be incorporated by replacing @xmath22 with @xmath96 and @xmath23 with @xmath97 .",
    "the mechanism by which actin or tubulin polymerization exerts a force also a brownian ratchet @xcite and is schematically illustrated in fig . [ actin ] . in the case of a load , @xmath95 , applied to a cell membrane , the cell membrane is in turn pushed against the tip of an actin filament , which usually prevents the addition of an additional actin monomer ( g - actin ) of length @xmath98 to the tip of the actin filament ( f - actin ) .",
    "however , with probability specified by a boltzmann factor , the membrane s position relative to the tip , @xmath99 , occasionally fluctuates far enough away from the filament tip ( @xmath100 ) to allow a monomer to fit into the gap .",
    "if a monomer does indeed insert and add to the end of the filament , the result is that the filament and therefore the membrane move one step forward , doing work against the load force . repeating this many times for many such filaments gives rise to cell motility against viscous forces . in class",
    "we also show movies showing cells moving as a result of actin polymerization @xcite , and _ listeria monocytogenes _ actin `` rockets '' @xcite .    ) , applied to a membrane against which the polymerizing actin filament ( f - actin ) abuts . only if the gap , @xmath99 , between the tip of the actin filament and the membrane exceeds the length , @xmath98 , of a g - actin monomer is it possible for the filament to grow .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]      similarly to eq .",
    "[ dxj ] and eq .",
    "[ dxh ] , we can write down an expression for the mean displacement of the filament tip in a time @xmath52 in the absence of a nearby membrane : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the concentration of g - actin , @xmath98 is the length of an actin monomer , @xmath66 is the actin on - rate , and @xmath67 is the actin off - rate .",
    "however , if the membrane is nearby , it is only possible to add an actin monomer if the distance between the filament and the membrane is greater than @xmath98 .",
    "assuming that the time - scale for membrane fluctuations is much faster than that for adding actin monomers , if the probability , that the membrane - filament tip distance is greater than @xmath98 , is @xmath81 , then eq . [ actinx ] is modified to read @xmath103 and the drift velocity of the tip is @xmath104 but application of the boltzmann factor informs us that , when the force on the membrane is @xmath95 , the probability that the gap is greater than @xmath98 is @xmath105 so that @xmath106 this is the force - velocity relationship for an actin @xcite or tubulin @xcite filament . although the load , @xmath95 , is applied to the membrane , the velocity is constant .",
    "therefore , according to newton s third law , as the students know , there can be no net force on the membrane .",
    "we may deduce that the load is balanced by an equal and oppposite force , generated by the polymerization ratchet .",
