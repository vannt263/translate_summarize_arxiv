    "the construction of a path integral for the weyl propagator @xcite , that is , the evolution operator , @xmath0 , in the weyl representation , makes no restriction on the form of the hamiltonian that generates the continuous evolution of a quantum system . except for possible minor modifications due to ordering , the weyl symbol , @xmath1 , for the quantum hamiltonian , @xmath2 ,",
    "is identified with its classical counterpart , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-dimensional classical phase space , @xmath6 .",
    "there is no need for the classical hamiltonian to be derived from a lagrangian , so that the path integral may just as easily be constructed for e.g. the kerr hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath7 , as for the usual form , @xmath8 .",
    "a classical trajectory coincides with a stationary phase of the weyl path integrand , just as with feynman path integrals in the position representation .",
    "thus , one obtains semiclassical ( sc ) approximations for the full path integral as a superposition of a few contributing classical trajectories .",
    "the main difference is that here the relevant trajectory is prescribed by a kind of boundary condition on the _ centre _ , @xmath9 , of its pair of endpoints , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , rather than by the pair of end - positions @xmath12 @xcite . in both the weyl and the position representations ,",
    "contributing trajectories may coalesce , with the passage of time , or with continuous change in the boundary condition . at these _ caustics _ ,",
    "the sc approximation has a singularity . in passing a caustic",
    ", sc approximations generally change their phase by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is known as the maslov index @xcite .",
    "if @xmath15 , then , in the position representation , @xmath14 coincides with the morse index @xcite . a more general geometrical phase space treatment of the maslov index for periodic orbits is presented in references @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approximation becomes exact in the limit where the hamiltonian is quadratic in the phase space variables .",
    "classically , such a hamiltonian generates a ( linear ) _ symplectic transformation _ between the endpoints of a classical trajectory : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a _",
    "symplectic matrix_. the symplectic subgroup of classical canonical transformations , sp(@xmath5 ) , characterized by @xmath17 , corresponds to the metaplectic subgroup , mp(@xmath5 ) , of general quantum unitary transformations , @xmath18 , that is , the group of _ metaplectic operators _ @xcite . the amplitude of the weyl propagator for a metaplectic operator is constant throughout phase space , but it has a true caustic singularity at an instant when the sc form of the weyl propagator must be replaced by a dirac delta - function .",
    "the action of a weyl propagator on other operators involves phase space integrals .",
    "therefore , in the general sc scenario where the region of integration may encompass different maslov phases , it is crucial that these be correctly evaluated .",
    "indeed , such switches of phase can be more important than the possibly integrable sc singularities at the caustics themselves , as occurs with the _ initial value _ or _",
    "final value _ algorithms recently proposed in @xcite . furthermore , there are applications where sc _ super propagators _ for wigner functions @xcite are specified by products of weyl propagators , each of which may traverse its own caustics @xcite , so that it is indispensible to determine the correct maslov phases in all cases .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to establish the general connections of sc weyl propagators ( and of their fourier transforms ) through their caustics .    in order to establish possible phase changes for caustic traversals , one needs to focus on the _ tangent map _ for the full canonical transformation in the neighbourhood of a given trajectory . in other words , one must study the symplectic approximation to the full canonical transformation between the neighbourhoods of the endpoints of a classical trajectory : @xmath19 , where the symplectic matrix for the transformations is labelled by the centre , @xmath20 , of the main trajectory .",
    "this is an essential ingredient of the sc approximation of the weyl propagator , @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , one can also construct an exact metaplectic _ tangent operator _",
    ", @xmath22 , represented by the weyl symbol @xmath23 , i.e. the _ tangent weyl propagator _ , based on the same symplectic matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "just as the tangent map is close to the full canonical transformation in the neighbourhood of its endpoints , we can define a small neighbourhood @xmath25 , to be measured from the centre , @xmath26 , and then we have @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this is a purely local approximation and that different arguments of the weyl propagator ( i.e. choices of the centre , @xmath26 ) are related to different trajectories with different linearized maps , so that the pure quantum tangent propagator is constructed entirely from a local classical map .",
    "hence , one can investigate the possible phase jumps of the sc approximation of the weyl propagator by analyzing , instead , the behaviour of the exact symbol for the tangent propagator .",
    "the tangent weyl propagators belong to the metaplectic group .",
    "the difficulty is that , even though sp(@xmath5 ) and mp(@xmath5 ) are isomorphic in the neighbourhood of the identity , the correspondence @xmath28 is not one to one : there is a double covering of the quantum group , i.e. a pair of metaplectic operators and , hence , a pair of metaplectic weyl propagators for each @xmath17 : @xmath29 . in particular , one should note that important particular symplectic matrices , such as @xmath30 , the identity matrix , and @xmath31 , the reflection at the origin , correspond to pairs of metaplectic operators , even though only one of these is commonly employed .",
    "since they only differ by an overall sign , the choice of different sheets of a metaplectic operator has no essential effect on how it acts on wave functions and this action completely cancels out for heisenberg operator evolution : @xmath32 . nonetheless , the choice of sheet is essential for sc applications and it lies in the focus of this paper , but we shall distinguish the sheet in the notation for @xmath33 only where it is essential .",
    "the notion of _ crossing a caustic _ needs to be carefully dissected in terms of corresponding families of classical maps and quantum operators : the quantum hamiltonian generates a continuous one - parameter family of evolution operators , @xmath34 , corresponding semiclassically to a family of canonical transformations , each of which may , in turn , be decomposed into its individual classical trajectories . in the neighbourhood of each of these trajectories ,",
    "one can then define a family of tangent symplectic maps , @xmath35 , and hence , a continuous one - parameter family of tangent metaplectic operators : @xmath36 . rather than @xmath35",
    "following the previous notation , because the centre , @xmath37 , of a given trajectory with fixed initial condition is itself time dependent .",
    "indeed , one also deals with caustics as the centre @xmath26 is varied while the time is fixed , but one needs to consider only one - parameter families of metaplectic operators , so this has been labelled as @xmath38 thoughout this paper .",
    "] such a family does not form a subgroup of the metaplectic operators , because it is not closed with respect to multiplication , but the _ product rule _ for each pair of sequential time intervals is satisfied : for @xmath39 , one has the exact product @xmath40 , corresponding to symplectic matrices , which also satisfy @xmath41 , even though neither @xmath42 nor @xmath43 need belong to their respective family .",
    "continuity of the classical family of symplectic transformations entails the continuity of the family of tangent operators , but this crucial point will be masked by caustics in any given representation .",
    "a caustic of the tangent weyl propagator occurs for the same matrix @xmath35 as for the sc approximation of the full evolution operator @xmath34 , but it is a true singularity , at which the weyl symbol becomes a @xmath44-function @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is only a pair of metaplectic sheets , corresponding to the choice of a @xmath45-phase ( i.e. an overall sign ) for the weyl propagator , does not prevent a possible phase change of @xmath46 across a caustic .",
    "however , it will be shown that it is only the overall sign that needs to be determined by the history of each trajectory , because otherwise factors of @xmath47 for tangent propagators can be inferred from the dynamical properties of the symplectic matrix @xmath35 .",
    "fortunately , the caustics of different representations occur for different values of the trace of @xmath35 and thus at different parameter values @xmath38 .",
    "this allows for swapping representations , where the continuity in a @xmath38-interval for one representation supplies the sign change at the caustic of the other .",
    "an alternative method to evaluate the overall sign of the propagator beyond a caustic is based on the exact product for sequential time intervals .",
    "these can be chosen so that both propagators lie in the causticless neighbourhood , which guarantees that the generalized gaussian integral for their product , which lies beyond the caustic , supplies the correct sign .",
    "nontrivial phase changes may in principle also occur for the product of finite metaplectic operators , or for their product with translation ( heisenberg ) operators , or reflection ( parity ) operators .",
    "the specification of these phases is important for the sc treatment of operator and super operator evolutions , such as @xcite .",
    "the case of parity operators demands special care because they have been defined with different phases in different contexts , namely the basis operator for the weyl representation differs from the operators belonging to the metaplectic group that we consider here .    after a review of basic classical formulae for the weyl propagators involving symmetric matrices and generating functions in ,",
    "the weyl representation of metaplectic operators and its fourier transform , the chord representation , are presented in .",
    "the choices which are here made for the overall phases , that were ommited in @xcite , is justified by the general consistency of the propagators on switching representation ( ) on the one hand , and from their products ( sections [ sec : producttransrefl ] and [ sec : productsmetaplectic ] ) on the other hand .    given the elegance with which the double sheeted topology of the metaplectic group is here seen to be rendered within the weyl representation , our aim is to provide a pragmatic recipe for determining the phase increment across each caustic , regardless of the metaplectic sheet .",
    "this is clearly synthetized in the concluding .",
    "a didactical appendix has been added to illustrate the theory in the quintessential example of products of harmonic oscilations .",
    "the _ centre generating function _ , @xmath48 , defines implicitly a canonical transformation , @xmath49 .",
    "this is achieved by a finite version of hamilton s equations , that is , defining the chord , @xmath50 , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 in terms of @xmath53 blocks , that is , the standard symplectic matrix in hamilton s equations .",
    "the endpoints are given by @xmath54 for the canonical transformation generated by a hamiltonian during a short time , we thus have @xmath55 , where the third order correction is given in @xcite .    the tangent map for the canonical transformation near a trajectory centred on @xmath56 is @xmath57 .",
    "it has the centre generating function corresponding to the symplectic matrix @xmath24 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ( symmetric ) hessian matrix for the full generating function evaluated at @xmath26 .",
    "( henceforth , the origin will be shifted so that @xmath60 . ) indeed , a symmetric matrix @xmath61 defines the cayley parametrization of a symplectic matrix @xmath17 @xcite , and hence the symplectic transformation @xmath62 , by @xmath63 with the inverse @xmath64 one should recall the fundamental symplectic property @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the transpose of @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to note that any @xmath5-dimensional symmetric matrix , @xmath61 , defines a symplectic transformation through , unless @xmath67 has an eigenvalue @xmath68 , whereas the condition for the symplectic matrix @xmath17 itself can only be verified a posteriori .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath67 must come in pairs , @xmath69 just as the eigenvalues of @xmath70 , which determine the symplectic flow for the hamiltonian , @xmath71 .",
    "they correspond to the same eigenvectors for which @xmath17 has a pair of eigenvalues @xmath72 .",
    "again , the fact that the matrix @xmath61 is real demands that any complex eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . notwithstanding that @xmath73 , one should keep in mind that the eigenvalues of @xmath61 are necessarily real , even if those of @xmath67 need not be .    for @xmath74",

    "this is a parabolic transformation , such that its symplectic matrix has the form of a jordan block : @xmath85    the breakdown of the cayley parametrization , such that @xmath86 , for a one - parameter family of transformations , if @xmath74 , is specified by the limiting matrix , @xmath87 so that the family of symplectic transformations goes through a shear with a reflection through the origin .",
    "this is the generic form for a caustic , i.e. for a single degree of freedom we have @xmath88 , or equivalently , @xmath89 .",
    "but there is only one eigendirection , unless the parameter @xmath90 in , in which case the transformation reduces to a reflection at the origin .",
    "the neighbourhood of a caustic can be neatly treated with the aid of the complementary cayley parametrization @xcite , @xmath91 with its inverse : @xmath92 from and one obtains the explicit expression for the new cayley matrix as @xmath93 thus , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are related by a similarity transformation and can be diagonalized simultaneously , so that @xmath61 and @xmath95 have the same signature and their determinants have the same sign .",
    "it follows that @xmath96 at a caustic , which allows for the neighbourhood of the caustic to be described by @xmath97 such that @xmath98 for a pure reflection .",
    "thus , @xmath75 is small near the identity and diverges near the reflection , whereas the situation for @xmath99 is the reverse . just as the cayley matrix @xmath61 specifies a quadratic centre generating function",
    ", @xmath100 is the _ chord generating function _ for a symplectic transformation @xcite , such that @xmath101 and again @xmath102 .",
    "thus , whereas @xmath48 becomes singular at a reflection , because all the chords then have the same centre , @xmath103 becomes singular for a uniform translation , for which all centres have the same chord .",
    "one should note that , since the eigenvalues of both @xmath67 and @xmath104 come in pairs of opposite sign , it is generally true that @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , one obtains from and that the eigenvalues for @xmath104 and @xmath67 are related by @xmath106 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 and @xmath99 change signs simultaneously at the boundary between hyperbolic and elliptic transformations , so that the classification in also holds for @xmath107 , providing that one interchanges @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath74 , both signatures @xmath109 and @xmath110 for an elliptic transformation , whereas @xmath111 for both parametrizations in the case of a hyperbolic transformation .",
    "for the present purpose , the most appropriate way to consider the weyl representation of an operator @xmath112 , i.e. its _ centre symbol _ or _ weyl symbol _ , is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the quantum operator corresponding to a reflection through the phase space point @xmath26 @xcite . within a translation ,",
    "this is just the symplectic transformation with @xmath31 , @xmath115 , though its main cayley matrix @xmath61 has a singular limit .",
    "it is important to note that such an operator is only defined within an overall phase , but in all standard definitions , one imposes that @xmath116 .",

    "thus , it should be noted that both amplitudes have here been specified by the square root of a determinant , rather than that of its modulus .",
    "there will then be a factor of @xmath47 , if the determinant is negative .",

    "are kept as a reminder that either choice can result for a metaplectic operator labelled by the same @xmath17 , depending on its previous evolution . in all cases , but the special appeal of the present phase space representations is that they are specified by invariants of the full corresponding symplectic matrix , @xmath17 . ]    one should keep in mind that for general motions the only difference between this tangent propagator and the approximate sc weyl propagator , corresponding to a nonlinear transformation , is that the action of the former is obtained as the homogeneous second order approximation to the full action @xmath48 .",

    "this scenario is in marked contrast to the chord propagator in this same region , which has its caustic exactly for those transformations characterized by .",
    "the change of phase across this boundary is then evaluated by just the procedure followed in the previous section , that is , by performing the fourier transform from the weyl propagator .",

    "the same method can now be employed to explore the possible change of phase within the weyl representation across its caustic , characterized by .",
    "what then is the result of reversing the fourier transformation , so as to return to the tangent weyl propagator from the chord propagator ?",

    "alternatively , @xmath194 need not equal @xmath157 ( with integer @xmath158 ) , if the evolution has changed the type of the transformation , being that the square roots in the amplitudes may be imaginary .",
    "this is just the case , if @xmath17 denoted an elliptic transformation ( harmonic oscillator ) , whereas @xmath66 becomes a reflected hyperbolic transformation , though both transformations are smoothly connected in the chord representation .",

    "finally , one should note that the overall phase increment for crossing a caustic in the conjugate chord representation , for a continuous evolution that crosses no weyl caustic , is obtained in perfect symmetry to the above results .",
    "operators that correspond to translations or reflections through a point in phase space are the building blocks of , respectively , the chord and the weyl representation @xcite . just as the metaplectic operators",

    "will be just the homogeneous metaplectic operator specified by @xmath220 , i.e. the product propagator adopts the cayley matrix of the original chord propagator .",
    "the factor @xmath221 may seem strange , since it does not fit in with the phases in .",
    "if one chooses @xmath201 for a harmonic osillator , the product may be matched to just a further rotation in phase space by @xmath222 , so that presumably should satisfy .",
    "thus , one should recall the conclusion in that the appropriate reflection included in the metaplectic group is not @xmath114 , but the operator @xmath170 . for the product of this metaplectic reflection with a general metaplectic operator , the factor of @xmath221",
    "is indeed cancelled in the corresponding expression to . in applications where the product arises because evolution acts on an operator specified by its weyl symbol , this extra factor must be included , because the reflection operator implied will then indeed be @xmath223 , rather than @xmath224 .    in practice ,",
    "the phase increment due to the product by @xmath223 is just @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath227 .",
    "this determines the @xmath118 sign and it is exactly the same phase increment as previously obtained in passing from the weyl propagator to the chord propagator in .    for the sake of brevity",

    "it is shown in @xcite that , upon obtaining @xmath236 and @xmath237 from the conditions , @xmath238 and @xmath239 , the resulting quadratic form in @xmath26 is just the centre generating function for the product transformation , that is , @xmath240 , corresponding to @xmath241 . adopting this stationary point of @xmath235 as the origin",

    "one must evaluate the determinant of the @xmath185-dimensional matrix @xmath243 $ ] , where one defines the symmetric block matrices : @xmath244 the phase increment is then @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the number of negative eigenvalues . in the limit @xmath247 ,",
    "one is left with @xmath248 , which has @xmath5 eigenvalues @xmath175 and @xmath5 eigenvalues @xmath68 , so that @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "this confirms a basic assumption for previous results in this paper : there is no overall change of sign for the product transformation , as long as the matrix @xmath251 can be treated as a small perturbation of @xmath252 .",
    "indeed , for a continuous one - parameter family of matrices @xmath251 , it is only at @xmath253 , as an eigenvalue vanishes , that there may occur an overall change of phase , unless either of the matrices @xmath254 becomes singular .",
    "just as in the fourier transform between the weyl and the chord propagators in , the phase of the determinant of the relevant quadratic form already captures part of the information supplied by its signature , i.e. @xmath255=\\pi[{\\textsf{n}}_-(\\mathrm{mod}\\ ; 2)]$ ] .",
    "the block form of the @xmath185-dimensional determinant allows for the simplification : @xmath256 where we define , @xmath257 further understanding of the @xmath5-dimensional matrix with this determinant is gained by drawing back to the interpretation of the amplitude of the weyl propagators in terms of the matrix between the midpoint and the endpoint of the classical trajectory . for the product transformation with symplectic matrices",
    "@xmath241 , we then have @xmath258 the alternative form of arises similarly from the inverse product transformation to , i.e. @xmath259 is related to @xmath260 hence , the amplitude of the weyl propagator for the product operator follows from @xmath261    the conclusion is that the product of a pair of metaplectic operators in the weyl representation results in a weyl propagator of exactly the same form , but expressed in terms of the cayley matrix for the combined symplectic transformation .",
    "the indeterminacy of the overall sign in the square root of the determinantal amplitude can only be lifted by evaluating the phase @xmath194 in . in the case of a continuous one - parameter family of product transformations ,",
    "i.e. a one - parameter family of double matrices @xmath251 ( or , in the simplest case , a one - parameter family of matrices @xmath254 , with the other matrix held fixed ) a possible change of the overall phase of the product only arises if there is a change of sign of @xmath262 .",
    "but , according to , this event entails a change of sign for the final @xmath263 , itself .",
    "so there is no change of phase unless the combined symplectic transformation crosses a caustic .",
    "it is often the case that @xmath231 can be identified with a member of a family @xmath34 for @xmath264 , while @xmath265 ; for instance , the symplectic hamiltonian flow : @xmath266 $ ] , where @xmath267 is the hamiltonian matrix . here , @xmath200 is an arbitrary passive metaplectic operator .",
    "then , if @xmath268 from @xmath187 until @xmath264 , the phase increment for a product can be obtained from the difference of signatures of @xmath5-dimensional matrices . one must be wary of the change of notation , since the transition of the cayley matrices in , which was @xmath269 , becomes here @xmath270 .",
    "the advantage of this alternative approach relying on continuity is that it only deals with @xmath5-dimensional matrices . in the case of the chord representation ,",
    "even the products of metaplectic operators can be considered within a @xmath5-dimensional integral , because of its simpler product rule .",
    "the deduction of the double sheet structure of metaplectic operators has previously been achieved by littlejohn @xcite within the position representation and for the chord representation ( with different notation ) by de gosson @xcite .",
    "our object here is not merely to show how the group of metaplectic transformations is represented by weyl symbols , but above all to determine the phase increment in each specific case .",
    "it may happen that @xmath271 and hence @xmath272 has a double root for a family of operator products .",
    "an important instance of this occurs if the commutator @xmath273=0 $ ] .",
    "this includes the case where @xmath274 , or where @xmath275 and @xmath276 are generated by the same quadratic hamiltonian .",
    "then @xmath277 and @xmath278 can be simultaneously diagonalized , such that @xmath279 and @xmath280 are their eigenvalues for the common @xmath281-th eigenvector of both these matrices .",
    "hence , the caustic condition for the product transformation , @xmath282 , reduces to @xmath283 .",
    "this condition allows for elliptic transformations , but not direct hyperbolic transformations , for which @xmath284 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath285 will also be a pair of simultaneous eigenvalues , so that @xmath271 has a double root .",
    "the change of phase at the caustic is then an integral multiple of @xmath45 , which is consistent with the need for a product of elliptic transformations to remain elliptic , i.e. there can be no transition to hyperbolic with reflection .",
    "an example of a single null eigenvalue occurs at the caustic of a family of products of elliptic with hyperbolic transformations : @xmath286 thus , defining the one - parameter family of transformations either by the parameter @xmath287 or by the parameter @xmath288 , there will be a single null eigenvalue , i.e. single zero of @xmath271 , at @xmath289 and another one at @xmath290 .",
    "the symplectic matrices corresponding to are @xmath291 for the caustic condition @xmath292 , one obtains @xmath293 so that @xmath294 , but @xmath17 is not a reflection .",
    "one can check that @xmath263 does change its sign as the product parameter @xmath295 passes the value 1 , which leads to a transition of the type of symplectic transformation for the product .    in all cases ,",
    "full account must be taken of continuity for the proper family of tangent propagators . indeed , one or both of the factor families may cross a caustic , without any effect on the overall phase of the product .",
    "an important instance is the _ fidelity _ , or _",
    "loschmidt echo operator _ treated in @xcite , such that the product of finite evolutions remains close to the identity operator .",
    "continuity of the product operator constrains the continuity of its weyl representation , in spite of any possible discontinuities in the phase of the factor propagators .",
    "this may considerably simplify practical calculations . the way that the phase jumps cancel for the particular example of a product of harmonic oscillator evolutions is analyzed in the appendix .",
    "it should be remarked that the sc propagator for wigner functions may be considered as a special case of a compound propagator resulting from the product of evolution operators .",
    "this has the peculiarity that the dominant classical trajectory is precisely on a caustic , so that a higher uniform approximation has been developed , for which the phases were previously analyzed @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the mixed propagator presented in @xcite avoids the caustic , so that its tangent propagator for short times is given by with a positive sign .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there are important applications where the caustic disappears within an integration , so that one needs only worry about the phase increment , which is the focus of the present study .",
    "notwithstanding the theoretical interest in the way that the weyl symbol renders the double sheeted metaplectic group , practical use of this phase space representation requires clear rules for phase increments .",
    "indeed , one should not need to be reminded about the abstract topology of this group so as to evolve quantum operators in the sc approximation .",
    "the difficulty lies in the crossing of caustics , either as time changes ( while the argument of the weyl propagator is fixed ) , or for different arguments of the same weyl propagator . in both cases ,",
    "the phase increment coincides with that of the appropriate family of metaplectic operators , each of which corresponds to a definite classical trajectory .",
    "fortunately , one can indeed summarize the conclusions in a nutshell :    1 .",
    "continuity of the family of metaplectic operators , corresponding to the family of tangent maps neighbouring each classical trajectory , guarantees that there will be no sc phase jump , unless a caustic is crossed .",
    "this even holds for compound trajectories that are pieced together to form _ super propagators _ for wigner functions , or for sc evaluations of the quantum fidelity .",
    "no matter how many caustics may have been traversed by the factor operators , one only needs to worry about phase jumps if the product propagator has crossed a caustic . in a causticless neighbourhood of the origin ,",
    "the sign for the tangent propagators in is positive .",
    "2 .   for each caustic traversal of the weyl propagator ( compound or not ) , one needs a sample of the classical cayley matrix for a pair of arbitrary instants before and after this sc singularity is met .",
    "this requires , either the quadratic approximation of the centre action ( i.e. the centre generating function ) or else the relation to the ( linearized ) symplectic transformation .",
    "then the phase jump is obtained by the difference in the signature between these cayley matrices . by expressing the amplitude of the weyl propagators in terms of a determinant without a modulus in , any factor of @xmath47",
    "is already accounted for beyond the caustic .",
    "the remaining ambiguity concerning the final phase of @xmath45 is then resolved by adding the above phase to the phase preceding the caustic traversal .",
    "the required information is naturally available in any sc computation .",
    "examples of these rules for products of propagators corresponding to ( exactly metaplectic ) harmonic oscillators with different frequencies are discussed in the appendix .",
    "the symmetry between weyl propagators and their fourier transform leads to similar phase recipes for chord propagators .",
    "they are an equally valuable source of super operators for which one must determine the precise phase .",
    "the phase jump upon crossing a caustic is obtained by simply replacing @xmath61 and @xmath296 in by @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "let us consider the product of evolution operators for a pair of harmonic oscillators @xmath127 , described by the weyl propagators .",
    "it should be recalled that these may be considered as tangent propagators for general nonquadratic hamiltonians , such that the corresponding classical tangent maps are both elliptic .",
    "the simplifying assumption here is that both maps can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "conveniently one keeps a common time , @xmath38 , as a single parameter for the product , while the frequency @xmath299 may differ from @xmath300 , even with respect to its sign , denoting a different sense of oscillation .",

    "<S> the quantum hamiltonian generates in time a family of evolution operators . </S>",
    "<S> continuity of this family holds within any choice of representation and , in particular , for the weyl propagator , even though its simplest semiclassical approximation may develop caustic singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the phase jumps of the weyl propagator across caustics have not been previously determined .    </S>",
    "<S> the semiclassical appproximation relies on individual classical trajectories together with their neighbouring tangent map . </S>",
    "<S> based on the latter , one defines a continuous family of unitary tangent propagators , with an exact weyl representation that is close to the full semiclassical approximation in an appropriate neighbourhood . </S>",
    "<S> the phase increment of the semiclassical weyl propagator , as a caustic is crossed , is derived from the facts that the corresponding family of tangent operators belong to the metaplectic group and that the products of the tangent propagators are obtained from gaussian integrals . </S>",
    "<S> the weyl representation of the metaplectic group is here presented , with the correct phases determined within an intrinsic ambiguity for the overall sign . </S>",
    "<S> the elements that fully determine the phase increment across a particular caustic are then analysed . </S>"
