    "in the experimental scenario considered at the cole normale suprieure the continuous source of atoms is provided by standard laser cooling and trapping techniques taking place inside a cell .",
    "atoms in the cell are captured , cooled and trapped in the @xmath3 plane using a two - dimensional magneto - optical trap , that is with laser beams in the @xmath3 plane and a dipolar magnetic field @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are unit vectors along @xmath6 axes .",
    "the atomic motion along @xmath7 is controlled with a standard moving molasses technique : the two counter - propagating laser beams along @xmath7 have different frequencies so that the atoms are cooled around a non - zero mean velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the already cold atomic beam emerging from this set - up is sent towards a magnetic guide of axis @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic guide is produced by the superposition of a uniform magnetic field along @xmath7 and a dipolar magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "this provides a transverse confinement of the atoms being in the right zeeman sublevels , the atoms in the wrong zeeman sublevels being not trapped or even expelled .",
    "the magnetic guide provides a trapping potential in the @xmath3 plane with a harmonic bottom that we write as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the atomic mass and @xmath12 the transverse oscillation frequency of the atoms .",
    "the following parameters of the injected atoms are expected to be realistic for @xmath13rb atoms @xcite .",
    "the initial velocity dispersion of the atoms is @xmath14 cm / s corresponding to an initial temperature of 400 @xmath15k ; such a high temperature is obtained after spatial compression of the cloud usually performed to increase the collision rate in preparation of evaporative cooling .",
    "we take an injection velocity @xmath16 larger than the velocity spread so that the incoming atoms form a beam . assuming an injected flux of atoms of @xmath17 atoms / s and an oscillation frequency @xmath18 khz we find an initial on - axis thermal density of @xmath19 atoms/@xmath20 .",
    "the initial phase space density is @xmath21 .",
    "the initial collision rate of atoms is related to the on - axis density @xmath22 and to the collisional cross section @xmath23 by @xmath24 . for the @xmath25-wave collisional cross - section of rubidium ( @xmath26  m@xmath27 ) we get @xmath28 100 s@xmath29 which is much smaller than @xmath12 : @xmath30 the atoms have therefore the time to perform a full transverse oscillation in the trapping potential before experiencing a collision .",
    "we assume that the atoms are subject to evaporative cooling in the magnetic guide , e.g.  by application of a @xmath7-dependent radio - frequency flipping the atoms to untrapped or expelled zeeman sublevels when they are too far from @xmath7 axis .",
    "the dynamics of evaporative cooling can be described by the classical boltzmann equation on the phase space atomic density @xmath31 as long as the phase space density remains small .",
    "the collision terms in the boltzmann equation are simplified by the assumption ( justified for rubidium ) that atomic interactions take place in the @xmath25-wave only and have a constant ( momentum independent ) total cross - section @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the scattering length ) .",
    "the effect of evaporative cooling is modeled by setting @xmath31 to zero in the domain @xmath34 for two - dimensional evaporation , or in the domain @xmath35 for one - dimensional evaporation , where @xmath36 is an adjustable cut in position space .",
    "we have first looked for an approximate analytical solution of the boltzmann equation , adapting to our geometry the truncated gaussian ansatz put forward in @xcite .",
    "as argued in @xcite it is then more rigorous to restrict to a one - dimensional evaporation scheme .",
    "the ansatz then takes the following form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the sum of kinetic energy and harmonic trapping potential energy along @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively and @xmath41 is the heaviside function .",
    "the ansatz assumes a local thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath42 .",
    "the temperature depends on @xmath7 only , not on @xmath39 and @xmath40 as , due to eq.([eq : coll ] ) , the mean free path of the particles @xmath43 is much larger than the spatial transverse extension of the gas @xmath44 : transversally the gas is in the so - called collisionless regime . for the same reason the truncation of @xmath45 in position space",
    "is replaced by a truncation in energy space , with @xmath46 knowing the energy of the particle along @xmath39 allows to calculate the maximal excursion of the trajectory along @xmath39 ( as atoms have in general the time to perform a full harmonic oscillation before experiencing a collision ) ; if this maximal excursion exceeds @xmath36 the particle is evaporated .",
    "there are _ a priori _ three unknown functions of @xmath7 in the ansatz eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) : ( i ) the normalization factor @xmath47 or equivalently the linear density @xmath48 , ( ii ) the mean momentum @xmath49 of the gas along @xmath7 , and ( iii ) the temperature of the gas @xmath42 .    by multiplying boltzmann s equation by ( i ) unity , ( ii ) the momentum @xmath50 , and ( iii ) the kinetic energy along @xmath7 , @xmath51 , and by integrating over @xmath52 one gets three hydrodynamic type equations for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath53 .",
    "these three equations contain the usual equations expressing conservation of probability , of momentum and of energy , plus extra terms describing the loss of particles , the change of momentum and energy due to the evaporation .",
    "we have solved numerically the hydrodynamic type equations in steady state , assuming that the @xmath7-dependence of the parameter @xmath36 is adjusted to maintain a @xmath7-independent ratio @xmath54 . for the specific set of parameters of  [",
    "sub : param ] we have to gain seven orders of magnitude on the phase space density to reach quantum degeneracy .",
    "the smallest spatial length of evaporation required is obtained for @xmath55 as shown in figure  [ fig : evap ] ; it is equal to 7600 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean free path at the entrance of the magnetic guide , that is @xmath58 meters for the considered parameters . after evaporative cooling along these 11 meters",
    "the flux of particles has been reduced by a factor 90 and the temperature has been decreased by a factor 4000 .",
    "we have also performed a numerical simulation of the full boltzmann equation by a monte carlo algorithm using macro - atoms @xcite .",
    "the resulting numerical calculations take several days on a workstation .",
    "we have first simulated the one - dimensional evaporation scheme . in this way",
    "we have confirmed the accuracy of the predictions based on the ansatz eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "we have also performed simulations for the full two - dimensional evaporation .",
    "we have found typically that the length required to reach quantum degeneracy is reduced by a factor three as compared to one - dimensional evaporation , with the same loss of two orders of magnitude on the flux . for the specific set of parameters of  [ sub : param ] the required evaporation length reaches the experimentally reasonable value of 4 meters .",
    "we now assume that evaporative cooling has allowed to reach the quantum degenerate regime at a certain distance from the entrance of the tube .",
    "we have not performed any kinetic study of the approach of quantum degeneracy , and we will here simply assume that the gas is at thermal equilibrium in the frame moving at the mean velocity of the gas .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable if the temperature remains significantly larger than the quantum @xmath59 of transverse oscillation of the atoms of the guide .",
    "if the temperature was much smaller than @xmath60 the transverse degrees of freedom of the gas would be frozen in the ground state of the transverse harmonic oscillator ; the gas would become a free one - dimensional bose gas along @xmath7 , that could not thermalize as colliding identical particles in one dimension simply exchange their momenta .",
    "in this section we consider the model of the ideal bose gas .",
    "the effects of atomic interactions are discussed in the next section .",
    "let us enclose the ideal bose gas in a fictitious box of size @xmath61 along @xmath7 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "transversally the gas is confined by the harmonic potential eq.([eq : pot ] ) .",
    "the one - particle eigenstates of the system are then labeled by three integers , the non - negative integers @xmath62 labeling the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator along @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the integer @xmath63 labeling the momentum along @xmath7 : @xmath64 in the grand canonical ensemble the mean occupation number of the single particle state @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 - 1\\right\\}^{-1}. \\label{eq : bose}\\ ] ] for convenience we have included the transverse zero - point motion energy in the chemical potential , so that @xmath15 varies from @xmath67 to 0 .",
    "it turns out that in our trapping geometry there is no bose - einstein condensation in the thermodynamical limit defined as @xmath68 with a fixed linear density @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the mean number of particles .",
    "let us consider indeed a fixed value of @xmath61 and let us define the maximal mean number of particles @xmath71 that can be put in all states but the ground state of the trap at a fixed temperature .",

    "this is connected to the known fact that there is no bose - einstein condensation in a one - dimensional homogeneous bose gas in the thermodynamical limit .    on the other hand , transverse bose - einstein condensation @xcite is taking place in our system .",

    "much higher than @xmath90 the gas becomes almost monomode transversally : this is an interesting feature for atom optics applications as we have achieved in this way a heisenberg limited transverse focalization of the beam .",
    "we can also consider the maximal on - axis density of atoms in the excited transverse states . in this case",

    "transverse condensation therefore takes place when the usual einstein s condition @xmath101 is satisfied on the axis of the trap !",
    "we assume now that the gas is in the strongly degenerate regime , with a linear density @xmath102 larger than the critical value eq.([eq : crit ] ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the coherence properties of an atomic beam evaporatively cooled in a magnetic guide , assuming thermal equilibrium in the quantum degenerate regime . </S>",

    "<S> pacs : * 03.75.fi , 42.50.-p    the first experimental achievements of bose - einstein condensates in atomic vapors @xcite have opened promising perspectives for atom optics : condensates constitute indeed atomic waves sources of much better coherence properties than the usual ` thermal ' sources like the standard magneto - optical trap . </S>",
    "<S> these coherence properties have already been demonstrated experimentally : interferences experiments between two condensates have been performed at mit @xcite and at jila @xcite , the first order correlation function of the atomic field has been measured in mnich @xcite , and suppression of density fluctuations ( that is fluctuations in the intensity of the atomic field ) has been revealed by a measurement of the mean - field energy @xcite and of three - body losses @xcite . by inducing a coherent leak of atoms out of trapped condensates several groups have succeeded in creating pulsed or quasi - continuous ` atom - lasers ' @xcite .    for future applications </S>",
    "<S> the already realized ` atom - lasers ' may suffer from the handicap of a low mean flux of atoms : the condensates were not experiencing any continuous loading of atoms , so that the coherent output of atoms terminated once the @xmath1 atoms of the condensate were leaked out . as the repetition rate of the whole sequence </S>",
    "<S> is limited by the time required to form a condensate by evaporative cooling ( on the order of seconds ) the resulting mean flux of atoms is @xmath2 atoms / s . </S>",
    "<S> several proposals have been made to refill the condensates with atoms in a continuous way @xcite but they have to our knowledge not been realized yet . </S>",
    "<S> recently we proposed a different scheme , based on the evaporative cooling of an atomic beam @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present article is to predict the essential features of our ` continuous atom - laser ' proposal . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section [ evap ] </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the calculations of @xcite performed to determine the required length of evaporative cooling of the beam to reach the quantum degenerate regime . in section [ ideal ] </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the coherence properties of the beam once quantum degeneracy has been obtained , assuming that the atomic interactions are negligible ; we find that the beam has large intensity fluctuations incompatible with expected coherence properties of an atom - laser . in section [ inter ] </S>",
    "<S> we propose a model of a one - dimensional interacting bose gas and we construct a classical field approximation to this model in the high temperature limit . we solve the classical field approximation using the formal analogy between functional integrals and quantum propagators : we find that the interactions between particles can dramatically reduce the intensity fluctuations of the beam . </S>",
