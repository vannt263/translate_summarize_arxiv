    "most of the material here is contained also in the paper @xcite , to which i refer the reader for details . here",
    "i ll give detail only in the calculation of the critical exponent , and on how gravity regularizes self - similar solutions , where i hope it is of more than technical interest .",
    "initial data for general relativity ( gr ) may or may not form a black hole . in a hand - waving way one might compare this to a phase transition , and",
    "there is a `` critical surface '' in superspace ( the phase space of gr ) separating the two kinds of initial data .",
    "choptuik @xcite has explored this surface in a systematic way . for simplicity",
    "he took a massless scalar field as his matter model , and allowed only spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "( the numerical calculations were still pioneering work , because they involve length scales spanning many orders of magnitude . ) to explore the infinite - dimensional phase space , he evolved initial data from a number of one - parameter families of data crossing the critical surface .",
    "let us call that parameter generically @xmath0 . by a bisection search , choptuik found a critical value @xmath1 for each family , such that data with @xmath2 form a black hole , but not data with @xmath3 .",
    "he then discovered two unforeseen effects :    * scaling * : near the critical surface , on the black - hole side of it ( @xmath4 ) , where the mass of the black hole final state is small ( compared > to , for example , the adm mass ) , it scales as @xmath5 where the overall factor @xmath6 depends on the family , but the `` critical exponent '' @xmath7 is universal between families . for the scalar field matter , @xmath8 .",
    "i should stress that this expression is invariant under redefinitions of @xmath9 such that @xmath10 is differentiable , with @xmath11 at @xmath1 : to leading order , only @xmath6 changes under such redefinitions . to clarify this , and to avoid speaking in terms of one - parameter families altogether , one can formally introduce coordinates @xmath12 on superspace such that the coordinate surface @xmath13 is the critical surface . then , for small positive @xmath14 , the black hole mass would be of the form @xmath15 and again this form is invariant under coordinate diffeomorphism - s such that @xmath13 remains the critical surface .    * universality * : near the critical surface , on either side of it ( @xmath16 ) , initial data evolve towards an intermediate asymptotic solution ( which i ll call @xmath17 ) , which is again universal with respect to initial data .",
    "( clearly this solution can not be a full - blown attractor , because all data must veer off it eventually towards forming either a black hole or towards dispersion .",
    "but it is an attractor of co - dimension one , or intermediate asymptotic . )",
    "this solution shows self - similarity . in the case of scalar field matter , this self - similarity is discrete , showing up as an `` * echoing * '' in the logarithm of spacetime scale , with period @xmath18 .",
    "the matter model of choptuik is special in that , even coupled to general relativity , it has no intrinsic scale .",
    "( this is equivalent to saying that in geometric units , @xmath19 , the action has no dimensionful parameters . ) therefore , from dimensional analysis alone , there can no be no static , star - like solutions , and hence no minimum black hole mass .",
    "generic matter does have both an intrinsic scale ( or several ) , and star - like solutions .",
    "astrophysical black holes thus probably have a minimum mass given by the chandrasekhar mass . to make infinitesimally small black holes from ordinary matter , one would have to use initial conditions ( for example rapid implosion ) not arising in astrophysics .",
    "the important point is that for any matter there is at least * some * region of superspace where critical phenomena arise .",
    "nevertheless , the interest of critical phenomena does not lie in astrophysics , but in the dynamics of gr ( with or without matter ) .",
    "recent work by choptuik , bizon and chmaj @xcite ( see piotr bizon s talk , this volume ) has clarified the role of matter scales . investigating the spherical collapse of einstein - yang - mills , they find two regimes : one with the usual critical phenomena dominated by a self - similar intermediate attractor ( `` second - order phase transition '' ) , and one dominated by the bartnik - mckinnon solution , which is a finite mass , static intermediate attractor , and therefore having a mass gap ( `` first - order phase transition '' ) .",
    "critical phenomena have also been found in two one - parameter families of matter models in spherical symmetry ( not to be confused with one - parameter families of data ! ) : the first family is that of the perfect fluids with @xmath20 , @xmath21 a constant @xcite .",
    "the other family is that of the constant - curvature , two - dimensional sigma models , characterised by the dimensionless curvature parameter @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "( this family contains the free complex scalar field @xcite , an inflaton - dilaton model @xcite , and an axion - dilaton model @xcite as special cases . )",
    "it is known for the latter family , and likely for the second , that at some value of the parameter @xmath22 ( and perhaps @xmath21 ) the critical solution switches over from continuous to discrete self - similarity . moreover ,",
    "the critical exponent @xmath7 depends on the parameter @xmath22 or @xmath21 .",
    "historically , the second occurrence of critical phenomena was found in the collapse of axisymmetric gravitational waves ( time - symmetric initial data , and hence with zero angular momentum ) @xcite .",
    "because of the much greater numerical difficulty , there are fewer experimental data , and regrettably , there has been no follow - up work so far .",
    "axisymmetric waves are highly interesting in two aspects : they go beyond spherical symmetry , and they are vacuum data .",
    "it would also be extremely interesting to see what happens for initial data with angular momentum , because black holes can of course have angular momentum , but it must be smaller than the mass .",
    "the critical solution for each matter model has the property of being self - similar .",
    "with hindsight one can see that this is the form scale - invariance takes in the problem .",
    "self - similarity however takes the novel form of echoing , or discrete self - similarity , in some models , notably choptuik s scalar field and axisymmetric gravitational waves .    the concept of ( continuous ) self - similarity ( css ) ( or homotheticity ) has been defined in a relativistic context @xcite as the presence of a vector field @xmath23 such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the lie derivative",
    "i now introduce the concept of discrete self - similarity ( dss ) . in this symmetry there",
    "exist a diffeomorphism @xmath26 and a real constant @xmath27 such that , for any integer @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pull - back of @xmath26 .    to see what dss looks like in coordinate terms , we introduce coordinates @xmath31 , such that if a point @xmath0 has coordinates @xmath31 , its image @xmath32 has coordinates @xmath33 .",
    "one can verify that dss in these coordinates is equivalent to @xmath34 in other words , the dss acts as a discrete isomorphism on the rescaled metric @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is intuitively speaking the logarithm of spacetime scale .    in order to clarify the connection between css and dss",
    ", one may define a vector field @xmath37 , although there is no unique @xmath23 associated with a given @xmath26 .",
    "the discrete diffeomorphism @xmath26 is then realized as the lie dragging along @xmath23 by a distance @xmath27 . clearly , css corresponds to dss for infinitesimally small @xmath27 , and hence for all @xmath27 , and is in this sense a degenerate case of dss . in this limit",
    ", @xmath23 becomes unique .",
    "the critical solution dominating critical phenomena for a given matter model ( and perhaps choice of symmetry , such as spherical symmetry ) , has two essential properties .",
    "first , it must be self - similar , either css or dss .",
    "secondly , it must have exactly one unstable mode .",
    "there are examples of self - similar solutions with more than one unstable mode , with exactly one ( i.e. genuine critical solutions ) , but not with none : the latter would constitute a violation of cosmic censorship in the strongest possible sense , that of a naked singularity arising from generic initial data .",
    "the presence of exactly one unstable mode , on the other hand , constitutes a dynamical explanation of the universality of the critical exponent . in this explanation ,",
    "near - critical data @xmath38 ( data near the critical surface ) are precisely those in which the one unstable mode is initially small .",
    "skimming along the critical surface , they are attracted towards the critical solution , which is either a fixed point ( css ) or a limit cycle ( dss ) , until the growing mode eventually takes over and ejects the trajectory , either towards black hole formation or towards dispersion , in a unique manner .",
    "the solution has forgotten from which initial data it came , up to one parameter ( roughly speaking , the number of echos , or time spent on the intermediate asymptotic ) which will eventually determine the black hole mass .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this behaviour for dss .",
    "a given spacetime does not correspond to a unique trajectory in superspace , because it can be sliced in different ways .",
    "a point in superspace does correspond to a unique spacetime , but not to a unique trajectory .",
    "in other words , there is no preferred time - evolution flow on superspace , and therefore figure 1 is true only for a fixed slicing condition , something extraneous to gr .",
    "i am currently trying to understand this issue .",
    "a possible solution is the fact that the preferred time evolution ( choice of lapse and shift ) should correspond to a `` renormalisation group flow '' , or change of scale .",
    "this is the case for example if one takes @xmath36 as defined above as the time variable .",
    "the analogy with critical phenomena in statistical mechanics would then be deeper : superspace corresponds to the space of hamiltonians , and and the preferred time evolution to the renormalisation group flow .    constructing the critical solution",
    ", one has to proceed in two steps . imposing certain regularity conditions and self - similarity ,",
    "one obtains a non - linear eigenvalue problem , which may have a solution . as a second step one has to calculate the spectrum of its linear perturbations and check that there is exactly one growing mode .    in the following i",
    "restrict myself to spherical symmetry .",
    "the regularity conditions just mentioned are imposed in two places .",
    "one is the centre of spherical symmetry .",
    "there one imposes the absence of a conical singularity in the 3-metric , and that all fields be either even or odd in @xmath39 , depending on their being vector or scalar under rotations .",
    "the other set of regularity conditions needs to be discussed in some more detail .",
    "the general spherically symmetric solution of the wave equation in flat space is @xmath40,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 arbitrary functions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 is dss ( in flat space ) if @xmath43 for some @xmath27 .",
    "one easily derives that the general dss solution in flat space is of the form @xmath44 + ( 1-z^{-1})g[\\tau + \\ln(1-z ) ] , \\quad \\tau\\equiv \\ln t , \\quad z\\equiv r / t,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are now periodic ( with period @xmath27 ) , but otherwise arbitrary functions .    with the exception of @xmath47 , a dss solution can only be regular at either @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , or at @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , or at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "all dss solutions ( except the zero solution ) are singular at the point @xmath54 .",
    "coupling the wave equation to gr in spherical symmetry changes the dynamics , but not the degrees of freedom .",
    "( there are no spherically symmetric gravitational waves . )",
    "surprisingly , the presence of gravity acts as a regulator . in the presence of gravity ,",
    "there is ( at least ) one dss solution which is regular at both @xmath48 and at the past light cone of @xmath54 ( the generalisation of @xmath52 to curved spacetime ) in the sense of being analytic , and regular , in a weaker sense , also at the future light cone .",
    "@xmath54 remains singular , in the sense of a curvature singularity .",
    "this solution is precisely the intermediate attractor dominating near - critical collapse .",
    "it is found by numerically solving a non - linear hyperbolic eigenvalue problem , with periodicity in some coordinate @xmath36 , and regularity now imposed at both @xmath48 and the past light cone .",
    "for all details i refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "i ll come back to the regulating effect of gravity in a moment , but first i want to conclude my mini - review with an idea of how one calculates the critical exponent .",
    "the calculation of the critical exponent is such a nice piece of dimensional analysis @xcite that i simply must sketch it here . for simplicity of notation",
    "i assume css of the critical solution , the more generic dss case is given in the paper @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the calculation that follows ( for css ) is identical with that of the critical exponent governing the correlation length near the critical point in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "let @xmath55 stand for the variables of the problem in a first - order formulation , in spacetime coordinates and matter variables adapted to the problem @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 is an element of the phase space , and @xmath57 a solution .",
    "the self - similar solution is of the form @xmath58 .",
    "( i wo nt spell out what @xmath55 stands for or how @xmath39 and @xmath59 are defined . ) in the echoing region , where @xmath17 dominates , we linearise around it . to linear order , the solution must be of the form @xmath60 here , the general form of the linear perturbations follows from the form of the background solution @xmath17 .",
    "their coefficients @xmath61 depend in a complicated way on the initial data , and hence on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath17 is a critical solution , by definition there is exactly one @xmath62 with negative real part ( in fact it is purely real ) , say @xmath63 . as @xmath64 , all other perturbations vanish , and in the following we consider this limit , and retain only the perturbation with @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , by definition the critical solution corresponds to @xmath66 , so we must have @xmath67 .",
    "linearising around @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath68 this form holds over a range of @xmath59 , that is , is an approximate solution .",
    "now we extract cauchy data by picking one particular value of @xmath59 within that range , namely @xmath69 defined by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is some constant @xmath72 , so that at @xmath69 the linear approximation is still valid .",
    "( the suffix @xmath0 indicates that @xmath69 depends on @xmath0 . ) at sufficiently small @xmath59 ,",
    "the linear perturbation @xmath73 has grown so that the linear approximation breaks down . later on a black hole forms .",
    "the crucial point is that we need not follow this evolution in detail .",
    "it is sufficient to note that the cauchy data at @xmath74 depend on @xmath39 only in the combination @xmath75 , namely @xmath76 as furthermore the field equations do not have an intrinsic scale , it follows that the solution based on those data must be of the form @xmath77 throughout , even when the black hole forms and perturbation theory breaks down , and still after it has settled down and the solution no longer depends on @xmath59 .",
    "( this solution holds only for @xmath78 , because in its initial data we have neglected the perturbation modes with @xmath79 , which are growing , not decaying , towards the past . )",
    "because the black hole mass has dimension length , it must be proportional to @xmath69 , the only length scale in the solution , @xmath80 and we have found the critical exponent .",
    "for completeness i mention that the scaling law is modified when the critical solution is dss . on the straight line relating @xmath81 to @xmath82 a periodic wiggle of small amplitude",
    "is superimposed .",
    "this wiggle is again universal with respect to families of initial data , and there is only one free parameter for each family to be adjusted , corresponding to a shift of the wiggly line in the @xmath82 direction .",
    "( no separate shift in the @xmath81 direction is required . )",
    "i now come back to the critical solution , which by definition is dss and regular . as i said before ,",
    "dss is imposed as periodicity in a coordinate system of the form ( [ rescaled ] ) adapted to the problem , and boundary conditions at @xmath48 arise in a straightforward manner , from the necessity of avoiding a conical singularity .",
    "the generalisation of @xmath83 to curved spacetime is more interesting .    from the form ( [ rescaled ] ) of the metric it is easy to see that the curvature blows up as @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , this singularity is a `` point '' in , for example , the following sense .",
    "let @xmath85 and @xmath86 be two points .",
    "their geodesic distance vanishes as @xmath87 as @xmath88 , for any values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the generalisation of @xmath50 to curved spacetime is the past light cone of this singularity .",
    "we use the remaining freedom in the coordinate system ( [ rescaled ] ) to label this light cone @xmath91 . from the analogy with",
    "the general solution of the wave equation in flat space one would assume that any solution regular at @xmath48 is singular here , showing an infinite number of oscillations of the form @xmath92 ( with @xmath45 periodic ) as @xmath93 .",
    "but this is not so , and i now show why .",
    "in flat space , the inward and outward travelling modes are @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "let us call their curved - space equivalents @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is @xmath97 that we expect to be singular at @xmath91 .",
    "the equation for @xmath97 , to leading order in @xmath98 , is @xmath99 where the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath6 are constructed from the other fields and are therefore periodic in @xmath36 .",
    "this approximate equation admits an exact general solution , namely @xmath102 the particular inhomogeneous solution @xmath103 is defined as the unique solution of @xmath104 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this solution exists and is unique , unless the average value of @xmath100 vanishes .",
    "the general homogeneous solution @xmath105 is of the form @xmath106.\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the average value of the periodic function @xmath100 , and @xmath108 is its principal function _ after the average value has been subtracted _ , so that @xmath108 is by definition also periodic .",
    "the periodic function @xmath45 depends on the initial data for the equation ( [ approx ] ) .",
    "i have not given the expressions for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath6 here , but in flat space @xmath100 and @xmath101 vanish .",
    "in the critical solution , which is far from flat , @xmath107 is negative and @xmath109 is positive .",
    "the exponent of @xmath98 , @xmath110 , is negative for the critical or neighbouring solutions . in consequence",
    ", @xmath105 only has two alternatives , it either blows up at @xmath91 , or it is analytic there ( for @xmath111 ) . to impose regularity at @xmath91",
    ", it suffices therefore to impose @xmath112 at @xmath91 .",
    "as it happens , there is locally just one solution which obeys this condition , as well as the other boundary conditions .",
    "as i have said , @xmath100 vanishes in flat space .",
    "but then the equation ( [ condition ] ) has no solution @xmath97 _ with periodic boundary conditions _ , because the average value of @xmath6 does not vanish .",
    "but the presence of the term proportional to @xmath97 changes the character of the equation quantitatively , and a solution always exists .",
    "( in the limit as @xmath100 vanishes , this solution blows up . )",
    "we have now found the solution in the past light cone of the singularity .",
    "the data on the past light cone then determine the solution up to the future light cone .",
    "( we can go no further because the future light cone of the singularity is a cauchy horizon . ) calculating this maximal extension numerically requires two more nontrivial changes of coordinate system , giving rise to fresh eigenvalue problems .",
    "we arrange the final coordinate patch so that once more the future light cone is a coordinate line .",
    "now it is @xmath96 which is potentially singular .",
    "its equation is of the same form ( [ approx ] ) , where @xmath96 replaces @xmath97 , and @xmath98 has been redefined so that @xmath91 is now the future light cone .",
    "now , however , there is no freedom left to adjust any data in order to set @xmath111 , and in fact @xmath45 does not vanish with the data we have in hand .",
    "so the solution can not be analytic at the future light cone .",
    "in contrast to the past light cone , however , both @xmath107 and @xmath109 are positive .",
    "this means that @xmath113 , with an infinite number of oscillations as @xmath91 is approached , is present , but vanishes at @xmath91 as a ( small ) positive power of @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath96 exists at @xmath91 , but @xmath114 does not . from the einstein equations , which i have not given here , it follows that the metric and all its first derivatives exist , but not some of its second derivatives .",
    "nevertheless these particular second derivatives cancel out of all components of the riemann tensor , so that the riemann tensor exists ( but not some of its first derivatives ) .",
    "figure 2 summarises the global situation , with one angular coordinate suppressed .",
    "we have spherically symmetric , discretely self - similar spacetime , with a single point - like singularity .",
    "the self - similarity corresponds roughly speaking to periodicity in the logarithm of the distance from the singularity .",
    "the past light cone of the singularity is totally regular , in no way distinguished from other spacetime points .",
    "the future light cone , or cauchy horizon , is perhaps as regular as one can expect , with the scalar matter field @xmath115 , the metric @xmath116 and the riemann tensor @xmath115 . in particular",
    "it carries well - defined null data ( which are of course self - similar ) , and there exists a regular , self - similar ( and of course , non - unique ) extension of the spacetime inside the cauchy horizon , with only the horizon itself of limited differentiability .",
    "surprisingly , the null data on the horizon are very small , so that the extension can be made almost flat and empty .",
    "the situation is similar in the other two cases where the critical solution has been calculated up to the cauchy horizon @xcite .",
    "the spacetime there is css , but also almost flat at the horizon .",
    "a limiting case arises in the closed - form solution of roberts @xcite , where the null data on the horizon vanish exactly , so that a possible extension inside the light cone is flat empty space .",
    "( in the roberts solution , the past light cone also carries zero data , in contrast to the other examples , where the past light cone is very far from flat . )",
    "finally i should add that at large spacelike distances from the singularity , spacetime becomes asymptotically conical , with a constant defect solid angle .",
    "of course , all these global considerations are not relevant to critical collapse , where the spacetime asymptotes the critical spacetime in some bounded region inside the past light cone .",
    "therefore , neither the singularity nor the asymptotically conical region , nor the cauchy horizon appear .",
    "looking back on what has become a small industry in the past two years , i think that the dynamical mechanism of universality , scaling and echoing is now understood in an intuitive way .",
    "furthermore we can calculate the echoing period @xmath27 and critical exponent @xmath7 as nonlinear eigenvalues , in a manner distinct from that of fine - tuning data in numerical experiment .",
    "critical phenomena have also given new material to the study of cosmic censorship .",
    "there are self - similar spacetimes ( spherically symmetric , except for one axisymmetric example ) with a naked singularity that have an infinity of decaying linear perturbation modes opposed to only one increasing perturbation mode .",
    "this still implies cosmic censorship in the sense that a generic perturbation , which will contain some small fraction of that unstable mode , destroys the naked singularity ( either by forming a horizon or by avoiding a singularity altogether , depending on the sign of the mode amplitude ) .",
    "but we are very close to a violation , in that we only have to set one mode out of an infinity of modes to zero to get the naked singularity .",
    "a single generic parameter in the initial data provides a sufficient handle to do this .",
    "( in the notation above , we only have to set the one amplitude @xmath117 equal to zero , and if @xmath117 depends in some way on @xmath0 , we can do this by adjusting @xmath0 . ) therefore by arbitrary fine - tuning of one generic parameter in the initial data one can obtain asymptotically flat spacetimes in which a region of arbitrarily large curvature is visible to an observer at infinity",
    ".    there are a number of important open questions .",
    "are there additional unstable perturbations of the critical solution among the nonspherical modes ?",
    "are there critical solutions in axisymmetry , or even lower symmetry ?",
    "is dss more generic than css ?",
    "how do the charge and angular momentum of the black hole scale as one fine - tunes initial data with charge and angular momentum , with the aim of making a black hole of infinitesimal mass ( and not caring about charge and angular momentum ) ?",
    "is there a preferred flow on superspace which would complete the analogy with the renormalisation group flow in statistical mechanics ?",
    "is there even statistical physics hidden somewhere ?",
    "( very , very unlikely , but who would have thought it of black holes pre-1974 ? )",
    "can someone give an existence proof for the critical solutions , which so far have only been constructed numerically ?",
    "can one prove that they must have the limited differentiability ( metric @xmath116 etc . ) at the cauchy horizon which i have described , not more or less ?"
