    "these new realizations have several advantages compared to their condensed matter counterparts .",
    "one is precise knowledge of the underlying microscopic model , another is the possibility to control the parameters of the lattice hamiltonian , a third is the absence of impurities in the system . due to the smallness of the scattering length compared to inter - particle separation , a gas of degenerate alkali - metal atoms is considered as a weakly interacting gas@xcite .",
    "however this is no longer true if the atomic scattering length is changed by means of a feshbach resonance@xcite or if an optical lattice created by standing wave laser beams is used to confine the atoms in the minima of the lattice potential , which strongly enhances the effects of the interactions .    for the case of the optical lattice",

    "this experiment has led to an enormous research activity in the field of cold atoms confined in optical lattices . in most experiments on cold atoms a magnetic field",
    "is used to create a trap that confines the atoms in the lattice .",

    "one , where the kinetic energy is dominating over the potential energy , has a superfluid groundstate and the other , where the interaction energy is the most important , has a mott insulating groundstate . for non - integer particle density",
    "the superfluid groundstate is always prevailing .",
    "for the one - dimensional case the predicted phase diagram has a spin - dimerized phase in the insulating regions with odd particle density and on - site spin singlets in the insulating regions with even density .",
    "this phase diagram was recently confirmed numerically@xcite .",
    "however , for the study of the order parameter the authors resorted to a mapping of the boson model to a spin model@xcite . by doing",
    "so the dimension of the local hilbert space is reduced from 20 or more ( depending on the maximum number of bosons per site ) to three , and accordingly the calculations are less time and memory consuming .",
    "however , this mapping is only applicable to the insulating regions with odd density , and is valid in the limit of very strong atom - atom repulsion .",

    "away from the limit @xmath21 but still in the insulating phase , higher order terms have to be included which will , in addition to renormalizing the nearest - neighbor couplings , add spin couplings beyond nearest - neighbor .    despite many years of study , the phase diagram of the spin 1 chain is not fully resolved . for @xmath22 , the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model",

    "they found indications of a quantum phase characterized by nematic quasi - long - range order in the interval @xmath34 .",
    "however the accuracy of this calculation is difficult to quantify ; their results are also consistent with either the correlation length being longer than the size of the chains considered , or a gap that is smaller than the numerical accuracy@xcite . also , rizzi et al.@xcite concluded from dmrg calculations that there is no intermediate nematic phase , although they found indications that a tendency towards nematic ordering is enhanced as the dimer order parameter goes to zero .    in the odd density insulating state with more than one boson per site",

    "the utility of _ abelian _ symmetries ( typically @xmath50 , such as particle number , or @xmath7-component of spin ) , is that it imposes a sparseness constraint on the operator matrix elements ; given a basis labeled by the particle number , for example , the matrix elements of some irreducible operator @xmath51 } | n \\rangle$ ] are non - zero only for @xmath52 . by storing only the matrix elements that are permitted by symmetry to be non - zero ,",
    "the memory use and computational cost is greatly improved .",

    "depending on the spin of the block basis states this reduction factor typically ranges from around 3 in the mott insulating phase where the block spins tend to be minimal , to 8 or so in the superfluid phase .",

    "[ besatt ] , we show the occupation of each site basis state , for @xmath39 . for this value of the spin interaction ,",
    "it is clear that there are no values of the coulomb repulsion @xmath12 where only even number of bosons is favored .",
    "this also follows from a simple energy argument , that suggests such a phase is unlikely : since the spin interaction energy is smaller than the charging energy it is costly to increase the density on a site by two .",
    "the energy gain by keeping the spins coupled to a singlet is much smaller than the energy penalty for the on - site coulomb repulsion .    for large coupling",
    "the system behaves similarly to a spinless bose - hubbard model populated with spin singlets .",
    "this limit is tested and indeed for @xmath98 and @xmath62 the system is essentially composed of @xmath99 empty sites and @xmath99 double occupied sites , see fig .",
    "[ besatt2 ] . the limit @xmath100 could localize the singlets to give a crystal phase@xcite , but we have not investigated this scenario . in this figure we also show , as a function of @xmath12 , the population in the different on - site number and spin sectors for @xmath61 particles per site for the spin interaction strength @xmath98 , and also the superfluid system with @xmath101 for @xmath102 . as @xmath40 is reduced , the charging energy becomes equal to the spin energy and the singlets are no longer bound .     and @xmath98 : once @xmath12 and @xmath11 are comparable in size a singlet condensate forms . b)@xmath61 and @xmath103 : for large @xmath12 this is an insulating spin - singlet state , seen from the comparatively high probability in the @xmath104 sector .",
    "c)@xmath101 and @xmath102 : spin singlet condensate .",
    "d)@xmath62 and @xmath98 : in this spin singlet condensate the lattice is half - filled with spin singlets . ,",
    "we have studied the 1d spinful bose - hubbard model using dmrg . by examining the energy and correlation functions we have resolved the behavior of the model for all of the parameter ranges that are physically relevant for optical trapping experiments .",
    "much evidence is presented showing that the insulating system with an even density is well described by the on - site spin - singlet picture .",
    "the spin gap in the thermodynamic limit is rather large , paired with a short correlation length for the spin - spin correlation function",
    ". the energy increases linearly with the spin of the system , showing that the energy required to break another singlet is given by the energy gap and is independent of the number of already broken singlets , thus the singlets are strongly localized .",
    "it has been more difficult to determine the nature of the other insulating regions . from the particle - particle correlation function",
    "it is concluded that there is a superfluid and an insulating phase just as for the spinless case .",
    "it has previously been suggested that these insulating regions are dimerized .",
    "the dimer order parameter which uses differences in bond energy is difficult to measure in numerical simulations since it is rather small .",
    "instead the oscillations in the nearest neighbor spin - spin correlation were used to show that it is likely that the odd density per site mott lobes are always dimerized .",
    "this is a relatively strong result for the third mott lobe , where the dimerization order parameter is quite large .",
    "for the first mott lobe our results are consistent with the @xmath0 heisenberg calculations of buchta et  al.@xcite and rizzi et al.@xcite .",
    "in general the numerical accuracy of calculations in this regime will be much better for the heisenberg model compared with the spinful bose - hubbard model , so our result does not contribute substantially to the argument over the absence ( or otherwise ) of the chubukov nematic phase .",
    "however what is clear is that the dimerization in the first mott lobe shows scaling behavior with an exponent @xmath105 throughout the entire mott lobe .",
    "we found no evidence for novel superfluid phases ; in particular the on - site paired superfluid suggested by zhou and snoek@xcite is absent in this model .    the energy gaps to spin excited states were studied , showing that the odd density ( superfluid and insulating ) and even density superfluid phase follow the form of a parabolic spectrum , proportional to @xmath106 ."
