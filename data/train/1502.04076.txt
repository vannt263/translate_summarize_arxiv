    "universal cycles are often loosely defined . in a recent seminar talk at viriginia commonwealth university",
    ", glenn hulbert offered the following description :  broadly , universal cycles ( ucycles ) are special listings of combinatorial objects in which codes for the objects are written in an overlapping , cyclic manner . \" by  special , \" hurlbert means  without repetitions \" .",
    "as an example , the cyclic string 112233 encodes each of the six multisets of size 2 from the set @xmath10 .",
    "another well - quoted example , from @xcite , is the string @xmath11 where each block is obtained from the previous one by addition of 5 modulo 8 .",
    "this string is an encoding of the fifty six 3-subsets of the set @xmath12:=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$ ] .",
    "a seminal paper in the area is that of chung , diaconis and graham @xcite who studied ucycles of    * subsets of size @xmath1 of an @xmath5-element set ( as in the above example ) ; * set partitions ( the focus of this paper ) ; and * permutations ( with a necessarily augmented ground set and the use of order isomorphism representations , e.g. , the string 124324 encodes each of the six permutations of @xmath13=\\{1,2,3\\}$ ] in an order isomorphic fashion , which is clearly not possible to do using the ground set @xmath13 $ ] ) .    in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath14 , there _ does exist _ a ucycle of all partitions @xmath15 of the set @xmath2 $ ] into an arbitrary number of parts ; for example , we have the ucycle @xmath16 of @xmath17 , where , for example , the substring @xmath18 encodes the partition @xmath19 . note that the alphabet used was in this case of size 5 , though an alphabet of ( minimum ) size 5 is shown to suffice to encode @xmath20 as @xmath21@xmath22 the above example reflects tongue - in - cheek humor , since there are 52 partitions of @xmath23 $ ] and the above ucycle has 13 cards of each suit  except that one spade has been replaced by a joker ! the authors also ask how many partitions of @xmath15 using an alphabet of size @xmath24 exist",
    ". this question will also be of deep relevance to us , as alluded to in the later section on open problems .",
    "as noted in @xcite , however , not much seems to be known about ucycles of the partitions @xmath25 of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that for @xmath26 , ucycles exist if and only if @xmath5 is odd . at the other end of the @xmath1-spectrum , the authors of @xcite showed that for odd @xmath5 , one could find a ucycle of partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into two parts , and that an  asymptotically good universal packing \" could be found for @xmath27 , i.e. , that there was a string of length @xmath28 with @xmath29 where each of the @xmath30 consecutive strings of length @xmath5 represented a different partition of @xmath2 $ ] into 3 parts of distinct sizes .",
    "the authors of @xcite also proved that ucycles of partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into 2 parts exist if @xmath31 or @xmath32 , as evidenced by the respective explicit examples @xmath33 and @xmath34 it is this work that we build on . in section 2 ,",
    "we generalize the above result on asymptotically good universal packings ( upackings ) to the case of all fixed @xmath1 as @xmath35 , as well as to ucoverings , which are also shown to be  asymptotically good . \"",
    "finally , section 3 is devoted to showing that the transition digraph associated with @xmath0 is eulerian . as noted in the work of @xcite ,",
    "this does not necessarily imply that universal cycles exist , since the digraph vertices represent equivalence classes of partitions .",
    "we use our result to prove , however , that ucycles of @xmath0 exist for all @xmath3 when @xmath4 and for odd @xmath5 when @xmath6 , the latter recovering the result in @xcite .",
    "we also ( re)prove that ucycles do not exist for @xmath5 even when @xmath6 . finally , we show that for even @xmath5 , ucycles do not exist when @xmath8 is odd ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the last result shows , e.g. , that ucycles of @xmath36 , or @xmath37 do not exist .",
    "there are infinitely many such pairs of values of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the technique we exhibit in section 3 has the potential to tease out many more results along these lines .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite was that one could create a ucycle of all surjections from @xmath2 $ ] to @xmath38 $ ] iff @xmath39 .",
    "since there are @xmath40 surjections that yield the same set partition , we need to be more careful , and proceed by showing in theorem 1 that for sufficiently large @xmath5 , it is possible to ucycle partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts of _ distinct _ sizes .",
    "we represent such partitions as surjections from @xmath41\\rightarrow[k]$ ] ; @xmath39 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the fact that _ asymptotically good upackings _ exist is proved in theorem 2 , where we provide an alternative proof of the intuitively obvious fact that for any fixed @xmath1 , the number of @xmath1-partitions of @xmath2 $ ] with non - distinct part sizes form a vanishing fraction of all partitions into @xmath1 parts as @xmath35 .",
    "for each fixed @xmath43 , there exists a ucycle of all onto functions @xmath41\\rightarrow[k]$ ] such that the preimage cardinality function @xmath44 $ ] is strictly increasing .",
    "following the standard process , we create a digraph @xmath45 in which the vertices are sequences of length @xmath46 , of numbers in @xmath47 , for which the addition of at least one number in @xmath48 at the beginning or the end creates a sequence of length @xmath5 which , using the special canonical format we have adopted , represents a partition of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts of distinct sizes . for example , with @xmath49 , 122333444 is a legal vertex , as is 123334444 . on the other hand ,",
    "112233344 is not in the underlying graph .",
    "a vertex points towards another if its last @xmath50 terms are the same as the first @xmath50 terms of the second vertex .",
    "the edges of the digraph , labeled by vertex label concatenation , are thus sequences representing partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 distinct parts .",
    "the problem of finding a ucycle is reduced to the problem of finding an eulerian circuit in this digraph . we know that eulerian circuits exist",
    "if the graph is both strongly connected and balanced , i.e. , for each vertex @xmath51 , the in- and out - degrees of @xmath51 are equal .",
    "it is easy to show that if a digraph is balanced and weakly connected , then it is also strongly connected , so all we need to show is that our digraph is balanced and weakly connected .",
    "this approach is used , e.g. , in @xcite .    showing that @xmath45 is balanced is simple -",
    "if a number from 1 through @xmath1 can be added to the beginning of the sequence at a vertex , then it can also always be added to the end of the sequence since it is only the numbers of 1 s , 2 s , @xmath52 and @xmath1 s that actually matter in determining if an edge represents a partition into distinct parts .",
    "therefore , the number of edges pointing away from a vertex will be the same as the number of edges pointing towards it .",
    "note that the in- and out - degrees of any vertex ( the common value is sometimes called the vertex degree ) , though equal , are quite different at different vertices .",
    "for example for @xmath27 , the vertex 123333333 has degree 1 ; the vertex 122333333 has degree 2 ; and the vertex 122233333 has degree 3 . in general , one may write down a formula for @xmath53 depending on the differences between the number of @xmath54s and the number of @xmath55s in @xmath51 .    to show that the digraph is weakly connected",
    ", we need only show that it is possible to reach a designated target vertex from any other starting vertex",
    ". we will let this target vertex be the one consisting of two 2 s , three 3s,@xmath52,and @xmath56 @xmath56 s  leaving all of the remaining numbers as @xmath1 s , in that order .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the target vertex of length 26 will be @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , we will show something stronger , namely that one can traverse from any edge to the edge @xmath60 from whence we may reach the target vertex in a single step .",
    "notice that such edges represent legal partitions in @xmath0 only if @xmath61 .",
    "key to our algorithm on how to reach one edge from another is the process of  switching \" numbers .",
    "for example , we can write out all of the steps to go from the edge @xmath62 to the edge @xmath63 as follows @xmath64 or , we can skip all the steps of  rotating around \" and just say that we  switched \" the 3 to the right of the 1 into a 2 . note that  rotating \" is always legal but switching in the above form might not always be , even in several steps .",
    "we need to have the  room to maneuver around \" while maintaining edge - integrity .",
    "we will show that the only requirement to reach the designated target edge from any other edge is to have the ability to  switch \" any @xmath65 into a @xmath1 and vice versa ( possibly through several steps ) , and that this is equivalent to having @xmath66 , where the  extra \" @xmath67 digits give us the needed room to maneuver around .",
    "we will let the partition size vector ( psv ) of an edge be a @xmath1-tuple that expresses the number of 1 s , 2 s , etc . in order .",
    "for example , with @xmath68 , the only possible psv s are @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ; and @xmath71 . in this case",
    ", there is no way , e.g. , to change a 2 with any other number .",
    "if , for example , a 2 is switched with a 5 , this forces the numbers of 1 s and 2 s to be equal , and other issues might arise if a 2 is switched with a 3 or a 4 .",
    "however , if we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the psv s are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , which will be seen to imply that no matter what our starting position , we have enough  spaces \" so that we can switch a 2 , 3 , or a 4 into a 5 ( possibly in multiple steps ) and back again eventually .",
    "notice that for @xmath73 , @xmath79 .",
    "for example , say we begin with the edge @xmath78 and we want to switch a 3 in a particular spot into a 2 , while maintaining the psv composition .",
    "we will do this by first switching the 3 to a 5 , then switching the 5 to a 2 , in several steps :    \\a .",
    "switch any 2 into a 5 to create space between the number of 2 s and the number of 3 s , we will then have psv=(@xmath80 ;    \\b .",
    "switch the 3 that we want to eventually switch into a 2 into a 5 , we then have psv=@xmath75 ;    \\c . switch a _ different _ 5 back into a 3 to create space between the number of 2 s and the number of 3 s , psv=@xmath77 ; and finally    \\d . switch the 5 we want into a 2 , yielding the switch we originally wanted .",
    "psv=@xmath78 .    in general , our algorithm to reach the target sequence",
    "will then be to first , if we have more than one 1 , change all extra 1 s into @xmath1 s .",
    "we will then underline the single remaining 1 as something we wo nt touch again .",
    "next , we will switch the number to the right of the 1 into a @xmath1 , possibly in multiple steps , and then the @xmath1 back into a 2 , again possibly through multiple steps .",
    "we will now underline the 1 and the 2 together , as something we wo nt touch again . next we will consider the next number to the right of this 2 and switch it to a @xmath1 , and then switch back from the @xmath1 into a 2 again , then underline the sequence @xmath81 , and switch all remaining 2 s in the sequence into @xmath1 s .",
    "next , we consider the number to right of the second 2 , switch it into a @xmath1 , and then switch from the @xmath1 back into a 3 , then block off @xmath82 , etc . , until we reach the target sequence .",
    "the following example illustrates the general technique .",
    "let @xmath83 .",
    "suppose we begin with the sequence    @xmath84 with psv=@xmath77 .",
    "there are no extra 1 s to change into 5 s .",
    "then we can first change the 4 to the right of the 1 into a 5 , but in order to do this , we must create space between the numbers of 3 s and 4 s by changing one 3 into a 5 ; we thus arrive at @xmath85 psv=@xmath75 .",
    "the 4 to the right of the 1 can now be changed into a 5 to get @xmath86 psv=@xmath74 .",
    "we now need to change the 5 to the right of the 1 back into a 2 by creating space between the number of 4 s and 3 s and then between the number of 3 s and 2 s .",
    "this leads to @xmath87    @xmath88 and finally @xmath89 where the vectors above all represent psv s .",
    "we then change the next 4 into a 5 and then back into a 2 as follows : @xmath90    @xmath91    @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94 and @xmath95 the rest of the algorithm proceeds as follows : @xmath96    @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113 this process works in general since , given an edge of weight @xmath114 , the sums of the gaps between the components of the psv may be as low as @xmath1 , corresponding to the psv @xmath115 , or as high as @xmath116 , corresponding to the psv @xmath117 .",
    "switching numbers , possibly in multiple steps , is always possible whenever there is a gap of two somewhere in the psv sequence , which is guaranteed by the choice of @xmath118 .",
    "question : does a better algorithm allow for a smaller threshold @xmath5 ?    the next theorem shows that there exists a ucovering of all partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts if @xmath5 is large enough ; for simplicity we let the threshold @xmath5 be the same as in theorem 1 .",
    "this is because any partition may be represented by a surjection satisfying the conditions of theorem 2 , though there may be multiple such representations when two or more of the part sizes are equal .    for each fixed @xmath119",
    ", there exists a ucycle of all onto functions @xmath41\\rightarrow[k]$ ] such that the preimage cardinality function @xmath44 $ ] is non - decreasing .    exactly the same as that of theorem 1 , except that the algorithm may terminate faster .",
    "for any fixed @xmath120 , the upacking and ucovering given in theorems 1 and 2 respectively are both asymptotically of size @xmath121 , the number of partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts .",
    "our proof will reveal that @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the lengths of the ucycles in theorems 1 and 2 respectively . as pointed out by professor lszl szkely , however , both these results are special cases of asymptotic results found in @xcite , where a threshold of @xmath125 is seen to hold for the property  partitions of size @xmath1 with distinct parts form a",
    " high `` fraction of all partitions of @xmath2 $ ] into @xmath1 parts . ''",
    "thus such values of @xmath1 can serve to improve the conclusion of corollary 3 .",
    "our proof is somewhat different , however .",
    "note that @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the number of partitions in which two or more parts are equal .",
    "reframing the question in terms of distributing @xmath5 distinguishable balls into @xmath1 distinct boxes , we would like to calculate @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the event that boxes @xmath55 and @xmath130 contain the same number of balls @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively . by symmetry , we observe that @xmath133    the function @xmath134 obtains its maximum value when @xmath135 .",
    "parametrize by setting @xmath136 , we see ( by stirling s formula ) that @xmath137 maximizing this function is equivalent to minimizing the natural log of its denominator .",
    "accordingly , define @xmath138 setting @xmath139 , we find easily that @xmath140 .",
    "the next step is to show that @xmath141 for @xmath142 and @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "it is routine to calculate that @xmath145 and thus that for any @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 the lemma follows .",
    "we now return to ( 1 ) and see that for a @xmath149 to be determined , @xmath150 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\leq & { k \\choose 2 } \\left(\\frac{k-2}{k } \\right)^n \\cdot\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left[2\\vp(n)f\\left(\\frac{n}{k } \\right ) + \\left(\\frac{n}{2 } - 2\\sqrt{n } \\right)\\max\\left(f\\left(\\frac{n}{k } + \\vp(n ) \\right),f\\left(\\frac{n}{k } - \\vp(n ) \\right ) \\right)\\right ] . \\ ] ] we will next use stirling s approximation @xmath151 at various points . note that whenever @xmath152 we have that @xmath153 .",
    "accordingly , we first see that for some constant @xmath154 @xmath155 so that first component of ( 2 ) is no more than @xmath156 .",
    "next notice that @xmath157 thus the second part of ( 2 ) , when using @xmath158 , is bounded above by @xmath159 which tends to zero provided that @xmath160 for any @xmath161 ( noting that @xmath162 is fixed ) .    finally it is easy to verify that the second part of ( 2 ) tends to zero if we consider @xmath163 as well .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "as in the previous section , we encode a @xmath1-partition of @xmath2 $ ] as a string of length @xmath5 containing @xmath1 symbols where @xmath55 and @xmath130 are in the same subset of the partition if and only if the @xmath55th character in the string is the same symbol as the @xmath130th character . since the cases for @xmath164 and @xmath165 are trivial , we always assume that @xmath166 . for convenience ,",
    "we use @xmath167 as our alphabet .",
    "we refer to an encoding of a partition as a _ representation _ of that partition .",
    "note that each @xmath1-partition of @xmath2 $ ] has @xmath40 different representations .",
    "following methods outlined in  @xcite , we construct a transition digraph @xmath168 for @xmath0 as follows .",
    "let the set of vertices of @xmath168 be the set of all @xmath1 and @xmath67-partitions of @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "there is an edge between two vertices @xmath51 and @xmath170 of @xmath168 if and only if @xmath170 can immediately follow @xmath51 in a ustring of @xmath1-partitions of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "that is , there is an edge from @xmath51 to @xmath170 if and only if the last @xmath50 symbols of a representation for @xmath51 match the first @xmath50 symbols of a representation for @xmath170 _ and _ the string formed by overlaying these two representations at their shared @xmath50 length substring is a representation of a @xmath1-partition of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "observe that each vertex that is a @xmath1-partition of @xmath169 $ ] will have indegree = outdegree = @xmath1 , and each vertex that is a @xmath67-partition of @xmath169 $ ] will have indegree = outdegree = @xmath171 . as an example , @xmath172 is shown in figure  [ fig : g_5,3 ] , with all vertices labeled with the representation having symbols appearing in the order 123 .",
    "now , the edges of @xmath168 are precisely the @xmath1-partitions of @xmath2 $ ] . furthermore , a partition @xmath173 can follow another partition @xmath174 in a ustring for @xmath0 if and only if the vertex at the tail of @xmath173 is also at the head of @xmath174 .",
    "thus , there is a bijection between the eulerian cycles of @xmath168 and the ustrings of @xmath0 .",
    "[ t : eulerian ] let @xmath175 with @xmath166 , and let @xmath168 be the transition digraph for @xmath0 .",

    "accordingly , let @xmath177 be a vertex of @xmath168 .",
    "we describe an algorithm for obtaining a path from @xmath177 to @xmath170 .",
    "we first find a path from @xmath177 to a vertex @xmath51 which ends in @xmath1 distinct symbols .",
    "we may arrive at such a vertex in @xmath56 steps by a path @xmath178 where , for @xmath179 , we choose @xmath180 to be a vertex connected to @xmath181 such that the representations of @xmath180 end in @xmath54 distinct symbols .",
    "note that choosing @xmath180 this way is always possible - @xmath181 will have representations ending in @xmath55 distinct symbols and if outdegree(@xmath181 ) = 1 then the only possible choice for @xmath180 has representations formed by adding the missing symbol of each representation of @xmath181 to its last @xmath50 symbols ( the case where outdegree(@xmath181)=@xmath1 is clear ) .",
    "now , @xmath182 has representations ending in @xmath1 distinct symbols , so for any path of length @xmath183 starting at @xmath182 , each vertex on the path will have outdegree = @xmath1 .",
    "thus , there exists a path @xmath184 , where @xmath185 has representations whose last @xmath186 symbols are all the same ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "then , by construction , @xmath188 . hence , @xmath168 is weakly connected and so it follows that @xmath168 contains an eulerian cycle .    hence , we know that eulerian cycles exist in @xmath168 , and therefore ustrings of @xmath0 exist as well",
    ". however , there may be ustrings which can not be turned into ucycles , which occurs when the representations of the first and last partitions do not overlap correctly , i.e. , they have their symbols permuted .",
    "this idea is illustrated in the eulerian cycle in figure  [ fig : g_4,3cycle ] :    if we start with the representation 123 of the first vertex , then this eulerian cycle represents the ustring 123312132 , which can not be turned into a ucycle .",

    "this follows directly from theorem  [ t : eulerian ] and theorem  [ t : k=2 ] .",
    "we can also use the permutation product to determine cases when ucycles do not exist . the easiest way for this to occur is if the multiset consisting of all associated permutations in @xmath168 contains an odd number of odd permutations since this ensures that there is no ordering of the associated permutations which multiplies to the identity .",
    "we call the multiset consisting of all associated permutations in @xmath168 the _ permutation multiset _ of @xmath168 .",

    "suppose @xmath51 is a vertex in @xmath168 , so @xmath51 represents a @xmath1 or @xmath56-partition @xmath239 of @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "we consider the edge @xmath240 which represents @xmath239 in either @xmath237 or @xmath238 .",
    "we know that the associated permutation of @xmath240 is determined by the location of the second occurence of the first symbol in a representation @xmath241 of the vertex @xmath242 at the tail of @xmath240 by lemma  [ l : associatedperm ] .",
    "first , suppose @xmath51 represents a @xmath1-partition of @xmath169 $ ] . if the first symbol does actually occur for a second time in @xmath241",
    ", then since there is a representation of @xmath51 whose first @xmath50 characters are precisely @xmath241 , it follows that @xmath240 has the same associated permutation as all the edges coming from @xmath51 .",
    "if the first symbol of @xmath241 does not occur a second time , then @xmath240 has associated permutation @xmath243 . if @xmath242 has outdegree 1 , then the representations of @xmath51 do not have a second occurrence of their first symbols , and so all edges from @xmath51 have associated permutation @xmath243 . if @xmath242 has outdegree @xmath1 , then the representations of @xmath51 have an occurence of all symbols before a second occurence of the first symbol , so we get that the edges form @xmath51 have associated permutation @xmath243 again . since each vertex of @xmath168 which represents a @xmath1-partition of @xmath169 $ ]",
    "has outdegree @xmath1 , we get the term @xmath244 .    now , suppose @xmath51 represents a @xmath56-partition of @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "_ case 1 , the first symbol of @xmath51 appears a second time .",
    "_ then either the first symbol of @xmath241 appears a second time , or the first symbol of @xmath241 is appended by following @xmath240 ( if the second appearance in @xmath51 is at the last character ) .",
    "if the first symbol of @xmath241 appears a second time , then by previous reasoning @xmath240 has the same associated permutation as all edges from @xmath51 .",
    "if the first symbol of @xmath241 does not occur a second time , then @xmath240 and the edges from @xmath51 all have associated permutation @xmath243 .",
    "_ case 2 , the first symbol of @xmath51 does not appear a second time .",
    "_ then the first symbol of @xmath241 does not appear a second time , and so @xmath240 must have associated permutation @xmath245 .",
    "however , in this case @xmath51 has associated permutation @xmath243 .",
    "note that since the first symbol of @xmath51 does not appear a second time , the last @xmath50 characters of @xmath51 represent a @xmath246-partition of @xmath247 $ ] , so this case occurs exactly @xmath248 times .",
    "thus , we have @xmath248 partitions that either switch from even to odd or odd to even ; in either case adding @xmath248 affects the parity in the desired manner .",
    "thus , each vertex in @xmath168 which represents a @xmath56-partition of @xmath169 $ ] has the same associated permutation as it does in the graph @xmath238 except for @xmath248 permutations which change sign . since each such vertex has outdegree 1 , we get the @xmath249 term .",
    "+ finally , the initial condition @xmath235 for all @xmath5 follows from theorem  [ t : k=2 ] , and the initial condition @xmath250 follows from the remark following theorem 5 in  @xcite    [ c : parityformula ] for @xmath251 and @xmath166 , @xmath252    we proceed by induction . for the base cases , we show that the initial conditions of the recursion in corollary  [ l : parityrecursion ] satisfy equation (  [ e : parityformula ] ) . if we define @xmath253 for all @xmath5 , then equation (  [ e : parityformula ] ) yields @xmath235 for all @xmath5 . also , if @xmath5 is even , then equation  [ e : parityformula ] yields @xmath254 as desired .    now , suppose that ( [ e : parityformula ] ) holds for @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "if @xmath5 is odd then @xmath46 is even , so by ( [ e : parityrecursion ] ) , the induction hypothesis , and the fundamental stirling number recurrence , @xmath257 if @xmath5 is even , then @xmath46 is odd and so @xmath258 .",
    "hence , @xmath259 mod 2 by ( [ e : parityrecursion ] ) .",
    "[ c : oddparitycondition ] if @xmath5 is even and @xmath248 is odd , there does not exist a ucycle for @xmath1-partitions of @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this follows directly from corollary  [ c : parityformula ] .",
    "[ c:346 ] if @xmath251 is even , then there does not exist a ucycle for @xmath260 or @xmath32-partitions of @xmath5 .    by corollary  [ c : oddparitycondition ] , we must prove that @xmath261 and @xmath262 are odd for all even @xmath5 .",
    "we know @xmath263 and @xmath264 , which are both odd .",
    "now , @xmath265 \\\\            & = \\frac{1}{4 ! } ( -4 + 6 \\cdot 2^n - 4 \\cdot 3^n + 4^n)\\\\            & = \\frac{1}{6 } ( -1 + 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1 } - 3^n + 4^{n-1})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we consider the term in parentheses mod 4 , then we get @xmath266 ( @xmath267 mod 4 for even @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus 2 only divides the term in parentheses once , so when we divide it by 6 we get an odd number .",
    "in addition to the question raised in the last line of the proof of theorem 1 , we can ask the following :    \\(a ) the smallest case remaining after our investigation is the one for @xmath268 , for which we have found the ucycle 3112311123213233112131322 . all other cases for @xmath269 and @xmath270 are solved .",
