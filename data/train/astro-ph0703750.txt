    "n132d , one of the prototype o - rich supernova remnants ( snrs ) of a massive progenitor , is located in the bar of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( danziger & dennefeld , 1976 ; lasker , 1978 ) . in x - ray morphology",
    ", n132d is an irregular shell of radius about @xmath0 with a break - out in the northeast ( mathewson et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "n132d is a good object to test the stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis models of massive stars since the interior fragments are exposed to direct investigation ( blair et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "n132d has two advantages for observation .",
    "first , because it is located in the lmc , the distance is well determined ( 50kpc ) and the extinction is low .",
    "second , n132d is one of the brightest soft x - ray sources in the lmc ( favata et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "multi - band observations have been performed on it .    in x - rays ,",
    "hwang et al . (",
    "1993 ) obtained relatively high resolution spectrum of n132d with the einstein solid state spectrometer .",
    "emission lines of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 were detected . in their work ,",
    "the best - fit element abundances derived with a single - temperature non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model are lower than the lmc mean abundances . with the data obtained by the concentrator spectrometer on board the x - ray satellite bepposax , favata et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) found that there should be two components with temperatures of 3.3kev and 0.79kev respectively .",
    "the element abundances derived with the two thermal components model are similar to the normal lmc abundances .",
    "hughes et al .  ( 1998 ) first reported the ccd data of n132d obtained by the solid state imaging spectrometer on board the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) .",
    "they fitted the asca data of high resolution with a single sedov model and found that the temperature is around 0.7kev and the element abundances are all around the lmc mean , too .",
    "based on the asca observation , chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) modeled the remnant evolution as the blast wave hitting the pre - existing cavity wall . with the extremely high spectral resolution of the reflection grating spectrometers on board the xmm - newton x - ray observatory , behar et al .",
    "( 2001 ) detected lines of c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe in the spectrum of n132d . images in the narrow wave - length bands show that , with the exception of o , the dominant part of the soft x - ray emission originates from shocked interstellar medium ( ism ) . using high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) on board chandra , canizares et al .",
    "( 2001 ) got dispersed high resolution x - ray images of n132d in which some regions of oxygen - rich material were clearly identified despite the spatial / spectral overlap .    in the optical and uv bands , with iue data , blair et al .",
    "( 1994 ) noted that the x - ray peaks near the center were generally associated with low - velocity , normal composition , optical filaments , rather than with high - velocity , oxygen - rich ones .",
    "morse et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained high spatial resolution images of n132d with hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "they distinguished oxygen - rich filaments from shocked clouds . comparing with the rosat images",
    ", they confirmed that the o - rich ejecta emit little x - rays .",
    "blair et al .",
    "( 2000 ) performed detailed spectral analysis on the data from hst .",
    "the abundance they derived from the shocked ism cloud in n132d is consistent with the lmc mean . from the spectra of the o - rich ejecta they clearly detected o , c , ne , and mg lines , but found no evidence of o - burning elements .",
    "they suggested that n132d is the remnant of a type ib supernova explosion of a w / o progenitor star with extensive o - rich mantle .    in radio , dickel & milne ( 1995 ) found that the 6 @xmath5 radio emission from n132d largely coincide with the x - ray shell , in other words the shell of n132d seems to be the source of both x - ray and synchrotron radio emission .",
    "recently , tappe et al . ( 2006 ) detected strong 24 @xmath6 infrared emission from swept - up , shock - heated dust grains in the n132d with spitzer space telescope .",
    "the image of 24 @xmath6 emission follows the x - ray image well . additionally , they detected pah molecular bands from n132d",
    ".    profited from the high spatial resolution of chandra , we have performed a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of n132d and present a fresh look of the physical properties of the remnant .",
    "we combined two sets of data ( obsid 121 and 1821 observed by c.r .",
    "canizares ) released by chandra x - ray center .",
    "both of the data were dispersed by the hetg at first , then read out by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the two observations were carried out on 2000 july 19 with exposure time of 22ks and on 2000 july 20 with exposure time of 74 ks , respectively .",
    "the tool we used to process the data is chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package ( ver . 3.2 ) . considering the effect of the spatial / spectral overlap after dispersion by the hetg",
    ", we only analyzed the zeroth order data .",
    "the two sets of data were reprocessed separately to generate level 2 event files following the threads for extended sources ( the threads are available on http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ ) . during the course of the reprocessing , we corrected hot pixels and cosmic ray afterglows , filtered bad grades and applied good time intervals correction . then we merged the two sets of cleaned data for subsequent analysis .",
    "fig.1 shows diffuse emission from snr n132d in the broad band 0.3 - 8.0 kev .",
    "regions shown in the map are used for spectral analysis ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "this image displays a horseshoe morphology with a bright ridge south to the center , similar to that found in earlier x - ray observations ( mathewson et al . , 1983 ; hughes , 1987 ; behar et al . ,",
    "2001 ) as well as the recent ir observation ( tappe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "it is easy to distinguish a bright shell with a break - out in the northeast .",
    "noticeably , there are some bright knots and thin filaments along the shell .",
    "the tricolor x - ray image is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the 0.3 - 1.0kev emission is coded in red , 1.0 - 2.0kev in green , and 2.0 - 8.0kev in blue .",
    "the images in the three bands were adaptively smoothed using ciao tool _ csmooth _ with a signal - to - noise ratio of 3 respectively . in the tricolor image , soft emission ( in red ) is basically observed all over the image .",
    "soft emission dominates the northeast region where the break - out locates .",
    "southwestward , the proportion of hard emission ( in blue ) increases .",
    "hard emission could be easily distinguished in the south part of the horseshoe - like shell .    from the overall spectrum of n132d ( fig.3 )",
    ", we can distinguish emission lines of element species o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe , as are seen in the xmm spectrum ( behar et al .",
    "considering the low signal - to - noise ratio in the high energy band , we only present the equivalent width ( ew ) maps of o , ne , mg , si , and s. here we have applied an adaptive mesh method to rebin the data so as to include at least 10 counts in each bin .",
    "ew map indicates regions of high line to continuum ratio , which varies with element abundances , temperature , ionization parameter , and even column density ( hwang et al .",
    ", 2000 ) .",
    "the ew of o ( left panel of fig.4 ) is high in the north near the breakout . in this map",
    ", we also see a shell which follows the x - ray intensity shell but is thinner than it .",
    "the ew of ne ( right panel of fig.4 ) is comparatively uniform across the snr except for some bright knots along / near the shell .",
    "the strength distribution of mg ew ( left panel of fig.5 ) follows the x - ray intensity image well but it seems to have smaller extent than that of o and ne , especially in the north .",
    "the ew of si ( right panel of fig .",
    "5 ) is fairly uniform , but the ew in an interior patch around ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) is roughly twice as high as the average .",
    "the ew of s ( fig .",
    "6 ) is enhanced in the intensity shell and an interior patch near the center .                              the overall spectrum of n132d is shown in fig.3 , which shows line features of oviii ( @xmath90.65kev ) , neix ( @xmath90.92kev ) , nex ( @xmath91.02kev ) , mgxi ( @xmath91.34kev ) , sixiii ( @xmath91.87kev ) , sixiv ( @xmath92.0kev ) , sxv ( @xmath92.45kev ) , arxvii ( @xmath93.12kev ) , caxix ( @xmath93.86kev ) , and fexxv @xmath10 ( @xmath96.65kev ) .",
    "due to its complexity , at least two components are needed to fit the spectrum",
    ". profited from chandra s superb angular resolution , we could perform spatially resolved spectral analysis of n132d .",
    "we defined 10 small - scale regions ( diagrammed in fig.1 ) for spectral investigation .",
    "regions s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , and s5 are located along the shell , and region s6 includes a part of the bright ridge ; c1 and c2 represent two bright interior regions ; l1 and l2 represent two faint interior regions .",
    "a nearby region which is not affected by photons from n132d was selected as background .",
    "we extracted spectrum from each region using ciao script _ acisspec_.",
    "all the spectra mentioned above were regrouped to contain at least 25 net counts per bin .",
    "the spectra were analyzed with software xspec ( ver .",
    "11.3.1 ) .",
    "we fit the spectra of the small - scale regions with absorbed nei plane - parallel shock model _ vpshock _ and/or the power law model _",
    "powerlaw_. we use the cross - sections of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and assume solar abundances .",
    "the spectral fit allows the abundances of the significant line - emitting elements to vary , while other metal abundances are set to 0.3 solar , typical for the lmc ( russell & dopita , 1992 ) .",
    "the thermal nei model _ vpshock _ provides the plasma temperature @xmath11 , the ionization timescale @xmath12 , and the normalization parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance to the source , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the electron density and the hydrogen density respectively , and @xmath17 is the volume of the region .",
    "approximatively @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the filling factor .",
    "volumes of the shell regions ( s2-s5 ) are calculated as the intersection of a sphere ( the remnant ) and columns .",
    "shell region s1 is assumed to be an oblate spheroid .",
    "the rectangular regions c1 , c2 , l1 , l2 , and s6 are approximated as cuboids with average line - of - sight size to be the remnant radius @xmath20 . using @xmath21 , we can estimate the density @xmath22 from parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the spectra from interior regions c1 , c2 , l1 , and l2 can be described well with a single-_vpshock _ model .",
    "results are given in table 1 .",
    "in the faint regions l1 and l2 , the temperature is above 1kev and the abundances of heavy elements are higher than the lmc mean while in the bright regions c1 and c2 , the temperature is below 1kev and the abundances are close to the lmc mean .",
    "the @xmath22 values of c1 and c2 are almost twice / thrice those of l1 and l2 .    .",
    "]    for the spectra of regions s1-s6 , one component model is not enough to get an acceptable fit ( spectrum of s4 for example in fig.7 ) .",
    "we found that there is always a hard energy tail above 2kev band which can not be fit well with only one thermal model .",
    "therefore we tentatively fit these spectra with two components .    as the first possibility , the complex spectra may include two thermal components of different temperatures .",
    "we tried to fit the spectra with double-_vpshock _ model .",
    "abundances of o , si , s , and fe of the hot components were thawed .",
    "the @xmath24 value is acceptable and the results are given in table 2 .",
    "the temperatures of the cool components are around 0.5 - 0.6kev while the temperatures of the hot component are around 1.5kev .",
    "some element abundances in s4 and s5 are slightly overabundant .",
    "the parameters derived from the ridge - like region s6 are similar to those derived from the shell regions except for the element abundances which are close to the average abundance of the lmc .",
    "the ionization timescale @xmath25 of the cool components are high ( @xmath26 ) in all regions ( s1-s6 ) except s4 .",
    "parameter @xmath22 of the cool components is almost twice / thrice those of hot components .",
    "we also tried the two - component model with equal abundances .",
    "the temperatures and ionization timescales are similar to those we present here .",
    "the abundances of the `` equal '' model are similar to those of the hot component in the presented model within their errors .",
    "the problems of the two thermal components models will be discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "another possibility is that the spectra contain a non - thermal component in addition to a thermal one .",
    "we fit the spectra with _ vpshock _",
    "+ _ powerlaw _ model ( spectrum of s4 for example in fig.7 ) and tabulate the results in table 3 .",
    "the photon indices are between 2.3 and 3.4 .",
    "the temperatures of the thermal components are around 0.6kev . in the shell regions ( s1-s5 ) , some element abundances in some regions especially s4 and s5 are slightly overabundant .",
    "the parameters of s6 are similar to those of the shell regions again except for the element abundances which are close to the lmc mean .",
    ".vpshock fitting results with 90% confidence ranges and estimates of the gas density for interior regions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for the interior regions that have been spectrally analyzed , we find that the faint regions l1 and l2 have higher temperature ( above 1kev ) and overabundant heavy elements while interior bright regions c1 and c2 have lower temperature ( below 1kev ) and lower abundances close to the lmc mean .",
    "we note that parameter @xmath22 derived from the volume emission measure of the gas in the bright regions is about twice / thrice those in the faint regions .",
    "the products of @xmath27 and @xmath11 for these regions are around @xmath28 @xmath29 , suggesting that the cool dense regions may be in pressure balance with the hot tenuous regions ( given that the filling factors are similar ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the shell regions s1-s5 have at least two components .",
    "both the double-_vpshock _ model and _ vpshock _ + _ powerlaw _ model fit the x - ray spectra of these regions well .    in the double-_vpshock",
    "_ case , the high ionization timescale @xmath12 ( @xmath26 ) of the cool components indicates that the cool gas has approached or been in the ionization equilibrium .",
    "however , the ionization age derived for the shocked gas seems too large .",
    "taking s3 for example , we estimate the ionization age @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the kinematic age of n132d is 3150 @xmath32 200 years ( morse et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "unless the filling factor is as small as @xmath33 , the ionization age will be too old to understand .",
    "on the other hand , the outer shell is commonly considered to be swept - up ism . therefore the co - existence of two thermal components along the shell is difficult to explain .",
    "one possibility is that the regions we selected to obtain sufficient counts statistics are quite large in physical extent and contain emission from gas at varying thermodynamic states .    in the _ vpshock_+_powerlaw _",
    "case , the spectra provide a possibility for the non - thermal component to be present along the shell .",
    "although the theories of x - ray synchrotron emission from snr shell still have open questions , more and more shell - like snrs have been confirmed to exhibit x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "two shell - like snrs , sn 1006 , and g347.3 - 0.5 , are found to be dominated by synchrotron x - rays with no emission line ( koyama et al . , 1995 ;",
    "koyama et al . , 1997 ; slane et al . , 1999 ) while some shell - like snrs such as cas  a , kepler , tycho , and rcw86 are predominantly thermal but contain a hard energy tail due to electron synchrotron . like these snrs",
    ", n132d is young and has a shell - like morphology .",
    "it is thus interesting to find a hard energy tail in the shell of n132d .",
    "the presence of x - ray synchrotron may be helpful in understanding the positional coincidence of the x - ray shell with the radio one ( dickel & milne , 1995 ) .",
    "the best - fit photon indices we derived are between 2.3 and 3.4 which are consistent with the typical value ( 2.5 - 3 ) for diffuse shock acceleration in those shell - like snrs ( ballet , 2006 ) .",
    "if the non - thermal component could be further confirmed , n132d would be listed as another x - ray synchrotron snr .",
    "the slightly enhanced element abundances in some portions of the shell might be ascribed to the dust destruction by sputtering .",
    "the ridge region s6 shows some consistency with the shell regions s1-s5 . in morphology ,",
    "the ridge connects the shell at the south . in spectra ,",
    "the parameters of s6 derived from the two models are similar to those of s1-s5 except for some lower element abundances .",
    "the spitzer images show that both the ridge and the shell have strong @xmath34 emission which is from swept - up , shock - heated dust grains ( tappe et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "so we suggest that the ridge region s6 may be the projection of a part of shell in which the ism is the primary ingredient .",
    "using the zeroth - order data of chandra hetg observation , we tentatively performed a spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy study of snr n132d .",
    "the ew maps of o , ne , mg , si , and s are generated .",
    "the faint interior regions have lower density , higher temperature above 1kev than that of bright interior regions .",
    "the x - ray spectra along the shell can be phenomenally described with either a double-_vpshock _ model or a _ vpshock _ + _ powerlaw _ model . for the double-_vpshock _",
    "case , the low temperature component has a unreasonable high ionization timescale , and two thermal components along the shell as swept - up ism are difficult to understand . for the _ vpshock _ + _ powerlaw _ model , ne and s are slightly overabundant in some regions of the shell , and the best - fit photon indices of the non - thermal component are between 2.3 and 3.4 , consistent with diffuse shock acceleration . if the non - thermal component is true , n132d would be listed as another tev particle acceleration laboratory .",
