    "@xmath1 boson production in hadron collisions is one of the ideal places for testing quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , because we can focus on its role in the initial state if the production is tagged by the leptonic decays of @xmath1 bosons .",
    "leptonic tagging allows unambiguous measurements of the production kinematics in a wide range of the transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath1 bosons with respect to the colliding beam direction . at high @xmath0 , typically around the @xmath1 boson mass ( @xmath2 ) or higher",
    ", the interaction is expected to be well described by a first order perturbative calculation of qcd including the production of an additional energetic quark or gluon . on the other hand , at low @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) , multiple radiation effects and non - perturbative effects of qcd",
    "are expected to determine the production kinematics .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) event generators used for evaluating the detection efficiency and acceptance of experiments are desired to simulate the phenomena continuously in the entire kinematical range including the above qualitatively different @xmath0 regions .",
    "the performance of mc event generators may depend on the actual implementation because the interpolation between the two @xmath0 regions is not trivial and the introduction of models is necessary to simulate low-@xmath0 phenomena . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the performance of existing mc event generators and a new mc event generator that we have developed , by comparing their predictions with experimental measurements on the @xmath0 spectrum of @xmath1 bosons at fermilab tevatron@xcite : @xmath4 collisions at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies ( @xmath5 ) of 1.8 and 1.96 tev .",
    "since the main use of mc event generators is for the acceptance and efficiency evaluations , experimentalists are mainly interested in the accuracy of relative spectra rather than the absolute value of the interaction cross sections .",
    "we therefore focus on the relative shape of the @xmath0 distribution in this paper .",
    "the cross sections of hard interactions in hadron collisions , such as @xmath1 boson production , are usually evaluated by separating hard interaction parts initiated by constituent partons ( light quarks and gluons ) from soft / collinear divergent contributions of additional parton radiations , in order to improve the convergence of perturbation .",
    "the soft / collinear contributions can be factorized and added to all orders of the coupling constant ( @xmath6 ) to give finite results .",
    "the results are provided in the form of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) which depend on the energy scale ( factorization scale ) of the hard interactions .",
    "mc event generators also employ the above approach .",
    "the hard interaction events are generated according to fixed - order matrix elements ( me ) , while the soft / collinear contributions are simulated with parton showers ( ps ) .",
    "mes are usually at the leading order ( lo ) , and the implementation of ps is limited to the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) approximation for technical reasons , although pdfs including sub - leading contributions are already widely used .",
    "there are two kinds of parton showers : the spcelike ps to be applied to the initial - state partons and the timelike ps in the final state .",
    "hereafter we focus on the initial - state ps since we discuss about the @xmath1 boson production tagged by leptonic decays .",
    "the initial - state ps should in principle give the same answer as pdf for the momentum distribution of partons along the beam direction if the approximation level is identical .",
    "in addition to the longitudinal properties , ps simulates transverse momenta of the radiations in order to provide an exclusive simulation of interactions .",
    "we need to introduce a certain model for this simulation , because pdfs are evaluated at an infinite momentum limit while ps simulations have to be constructed in a finite momentum frame .",
    "the main issue in the model is to define the relation between variables in the infinite - momentum frame and kinematical variables in the finite - momentum frame .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 spectra may depend on the introduced model .",
    "the transverse activities of qcd radiations result in a finite transverse recoil of hard interaction events , and produce additional hadronic activities visible in detectors .",
    "since these effects alter the acceptance and detection efficiency of measurements , mc event generators implementing ps are indispensable tools for hadron collision experiments . because any inaccuracy in the simulation may deteriorate the measurement precision , mc event generators are required to reproduce actual phenomena as precisely as possible in the whole kinematical region .",
    "the transverse recoil can also be evaluated analytically by the resummation@xcite .",
    "the resummation studies usually include next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) or further sub - leading contributions , and provide predictions in good agreement with the measured @xmath1 boson @xmath0 spectrum@xcite . on the other hand , it is known for long time that the most widely - used event generator , pythia@xcite , shows substantially softer @xmath0 spectra of @xmath1 bosons .",
    "the deviation is significant at low @xmath0 where ps is expected to play a dominant role .",
    "the authors in a previous study@xcite suggested that the deviation might be partly due to a sub - leading effect missing in the ps simulation .",
    "the problem must be serious if the deviation is actually due to the lack of sub - leading contributions . in order to make the situation clearer",
    ", we first re - examine the performance of existing mc event generators .",
    "the simulations by the most popular lo event generators , pythia and herwig , are compared in fig .  [",
    "fig : pyhw ] with the experimental data for the @xmath7 channel measured by cdf@xcite and d0@xcite at tevatron run 1 ( @xmath5 = 1.8 tev ) .",
    "the d0 data ( triangles ) are multiplied by a factor of 1.12 to compensate for the difference in the total cross section with respect to the cdf data ( circles)@xcite .",
    "histograms show the results of pythia 6.419@xcite and herwig 6.510@xcite .",
    "pythia results are shown for two different ps models : the old ps ( default , mstp(81 ) = 1 ) and the new ps ( mstp(81 ) = 21 ) .",
    "all the other parameters are unchanged from the default .",
    "the herwig result is also obtained using its default setting , but a so - called primordial @xmath8 effect is added by smearing the generated events with an additional @xmath0 that is randomly generated according to the two - dimensional gaussian distribution having one standard deviation of 2.0 gev/@xmath9 . this value is smaller than the pythia default by a factor of @xmath10 , because the same amount of smearing is applied to each beam in pythia .",
    "we expect that the primordial @xmath8 should include perturbative effects in a soft region which ps does not cover , as well as non - perturbative effects inside hadrons .",
    "therefore , it may depend on the ps implemented in the simulation .    according to the signal definition of cdf ,",
    "an invariant mass cut ( @xmath11 gev/@xmath12 ) is applied to the generated events in all the simulations , although the specific cut values are not important in the present study .",
    "the choice of pdf is not important , too .",
    "though the used pdfs are rather old , we observe no significant change even when we replace them with a recent one ( cteq6l1 ) .",
    "all the results are normalized to the total cross section measured by cdf in order to compare the relative spectra",
    ".    the so - called me correction is applied in all the simulations , where the maximum energy scale of ps is set to a very large value , and the generated events are reweighted so that the frequency of the hardest radiation matches the prediction from the matrix element ( me ) calculation including one additional jet ( a parton in the final state ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 spectrum should be equal to the prediction from the @xmath1 + 1 jet me at high @xmath0 if the behavior of ps is correctly known .",
    "the jet radiation is naturally suppressed at low @xmath0 as a result of higher - order effects since it is generated by ps .",
    "this is one of the solutions for the double - count problem : a problem that arises when we naively apply the @xmath1 + 1 jet me for event generation , where the radiation effects are doubly counted by the me and ps .    first , look at the distribution at high @xmath0 ( @xmath13 gev/@xmath9 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyhw]a .",
    "although the pythia old ps simulation ( dotted ) gives a continuously smaller prediction , all the simulations reasonably reproduce the experimental data , at least in their @xmath0 dependence .",
    "this shows that the me correction works well , and that the lowest - order me calculation for one additional jet is sufficient for reproducing the @xmath0 dependence at high @xmath0 .",
    "the predictions of pythia new ps ( dashed ) and herwig ( solid ) are close to each other , except in the medium @xmath0 region ( @xmath14 gev/@xmath9 ) , where the herwig result shows a small enhancement .",
    "the difference between the three simulations is obvious in the low-@xmath0 region ( @xmath15 20 gev/@xmath9 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyhw]b .",
    "pythia new ps reproduces the data very well , while pythia old ps gives a higher peak and herwig gives a lower peak .",
    "the peak positions ( @xmath163 gev/@xmath9 ) are almost identical because they are , at least in the pythia simulations , predominantly determined by the primordial @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the peak height is determined by the distribution in off - peak regions ( @xmath17 gev/@xmath9 ) since the simulations are normalized to the total yield .",
    "the herwig result shows some enhancement in off - peak low-@xmath0 and medium-@xmath0 regions .",
    "the peak height reduces to compensate for the enhancement .",
    "pythia old ps gives continuously lower predictions in the off - peak regions . as a result , the peak becomes very high .",
    "the pythia simulation in the previous study@xcite corresponds to this pythia old ps simulation .",
    "the above result is consistent with the previous observation .",
    "the principal difference between the three simulations is in the choice of the evolution ( ordering ) variable in ps .",
    "the virtuality ( @xmath18 ) is chosen in pythia old ps , while @xmath0 is used in the new ps , and an angle - based variable in herwig .",
    "do the above results imply that the @xmath0 spectrum depends on the choice of the evolution variable , and that @xmath0 is the best choice among them ?",
    "we have illustrated another simulation result based on pythia old ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyhw ] ( dot - dashed histogram ) .",
    "it comes from the so - called cdf tune - aw@xcite , where parameters in pythia are tuned by cdf so that the simulation well reproduces their data .",
    "we have used an older version of pythia ( 6.212 ) for this simulation because the tuning is sensitive to it .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish this result from the pythia new ps simulation ; namely , the result reproduces the data very well .",
    "though the result is good , this tuning includes an unnatural setting of a parameter : parp(64 ) = 0.2 . the squared energy scale used for evaluating @xmath6 in ps",
    "is multiplied by this parameter .",
    "if we reset it to the default value ( @xmath19 ) , we obtain a result similar to the pythia old ps simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyhw ] .",
    "since the coupling strength is significantly changed , this tuning explicitly violates the consistency between ps and pdf .",
    "the success of this tuning may imply that the success of pythia new ps may also be attributed to some tuning that is specific to the referred measurements .",
    "an independent test is necessary in order to clarify such a suspicion and to answer the question concerning the choice of the evolution variable .",
    "as reported in our previous paper@xcite , we have developed a technique to consistently merge me calculations for @xmath20 + 0 jet and @xmath20 + 1 jet production processes in hadron collisions by employing the limited leading - log ( lll ) subtraction@xcite together with a built - in leading - log ( ll ) ps .",
    "this is another solution ( a matching method ) for the double - count problem .",
    "we have recently imported this technique into the gr@ppa event generator@xcite , where mes have been generated using the grace system@xcite , and the cross - section integration and event unweighting are automatically carried out within the framework of bases / spring@xcite . as a result , it is now rather easy to apply our matching method to other processes , because many processes are already implemented in gr@ppa .    we have first applied the matching method to @xmath1 boson production and simulated the process in the tevatron run 1 condition . the simulation has been carried out by setting the factorization scale ( @xmath21 ) and the renormalization scale ( @xmath22 ) to be equal to the @xmath1 boson mass ( @xmath2 = 91.19 gev ) as the default . in our matching method , the divergent leading - logarithmic ( ll )",
    "components are numerically subtracted from the @xmath1 + 1 jet mes when @xmath18 ( @xmath23 ) of the jet is smaller than @xmath24 ; consequently , the remaining @xmath1 + 1 jet cross section becomes finite .",
    "though a @xmath0 cut ( @xmath25 1 gev/@xmath9 ) is applied to the jet for numerical stability , its effect is negligible since the differential cross section converges to zero as @xmath26 after the subtraction .",
    "since the subtraction is unphysical , we may have negative cross sections in some phase space , leading to the generation of events having a negative weight .",
    "note that , since the unweighting is automatically done by spring , the generated events always have a weight of @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "physical distributions can be obtained by subtracting the number of negative - weight events from the number of events having a weight of @xmath27 in each histogram bin .",
    "though this subtraction deteriorates the statistical accuracy , it is not a serious problem because the overall fraction of the negative - weight events is only 2% in the present simulation .",
    "the subtracted lll components are restored by applying a ps to the @xmath1 + 0 jet simulation .",
    "thus , the maximum energy scale of ps ( @xmath29 ) must be equal to @xmath21 in our method .",
    "our ps employs a forward evolution technique@xcite based on the sudakov form factor at the leading order , which is expressed as @xmath30 , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 symbolically represents the leading - order splitting functions summed over all possible branches .",
    "the ps branches are , therefore , ordered in @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 cuts off the divergences in the splitting functions .",
    "we take @xmath33 as the default .",
    "physical properties such as cross sections and the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath1 do not depend on this cutoff if it is sufficiently small .",
    "we have confirmed the independence by changing the cutoff value down to @xmath34 .    in our simulation",
    ", ps replaces the qcd evolution in pdf .",
    "a pdf is used for determining the initial condition at a small @xmath18 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we set @xmath36 = 4.6 gev and use cteq6l1@xcite for the initial pdf .",
    "light quarks up to @xmath37 and gluons are taken as the constituents .",
    "this simulation gives results close to the ones obtained by the conventional method that uses pdf for the evolution , with a precision at the level of 1% in the total cross section .",
    "the theoretical basis of our ps is in principle same as that of pythia old ps ; namely , the approximation is at the ll order and the branches are ordered in @xmath18 .",
    "the difference is in the model of branch kinematics .",
    "pythia old ps identifies @xmath18 as the virtuality of evolving partons and the @xmath38 parameter as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the squared cm energies of the colliding partons before and after branching , respectively .",
    "the momenta of partons are calculated from the energy - momentum conservation based on these definitions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 of the branch is , therefore , determined indirectly in this calculation . on the other hand , in our ps , while the definition of @xmath38 is the same , the @xmath0 of each branch with respect to the colliding parton direction is `` prefixed''@xcite according to the relation , @xmath42 this is the simplest relation derived from a massless approximation where the incoming partons and the radiation are assumed to be massless .",
    "four - momenta of the radiation and the recoil parton are determined from the @xmath0 and @xmath38 values and the four - momenta of the partons before branching ( the @xmath0-prefixed branch kinematics ) . as a result , @xmath18 is no longer identical to the virtuality of the evolving partons .",
    "though not often , @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ ptdef ] ) may exceed the kinematically allowed maximum .",
    "the @xmath0 value is set to the allowed maximum in such cases .",
    "in addition , the kinematics determination fails in about 0.1% of the events because the calculated virtuality of the recoil parton becomes too large .",
    "the event generation is retried in this case .",
    "the ps is also applied to the lll - subtracted @xmath1 + 1 jet events with the same energy scale setting .",
    "therefore , it never generates secondary radiations harder than @xmath21 . in our previous study@xcite",
    ", we required that the @xmath0 of ps branches should never exceed that of the jet in me .",
    "this requirement is not applied in the present study because there is no reason to require such an ordering to non - logarithmic components remaining at @xmath43 .",
    "the generated events are stored as a simple dump of the lha event record@xcite and fed to pythia 6.419 .",
    "the energy scale in the event record is set to 4.6 gev , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath36 value of our ps .",

    "this is a scaling factor for @xmath45 of the initial - state ps .",
    "the default value is 4.0 ; namely , the energy scale given in the event record is doubled .",
    "since we do not want the energy scale to increase , we reset it to 1.0 . however , these details , except for the primordial @xmath8 , are not important in the present study .",
    "the simulation result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grappa ] ( solid histogram ) .",
    "the total yield is again normalized to the cdf cross section",
    ". we can observe that the result reproduces the experimental data very well .",
    "it is not surprising that good agreement is observed in the high-@xmath0 regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grappa]a , since it is the purpose of our matching method . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement at low @xmath0 is surprising because we have not considered the low-@xmath0 behavior .",
    "note that the contribution of the lll - subtracted @xmath1 + 1 jet is negligible in the low-@xmath0 region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grappa]b .",
    "our matching method has an explicit dependence on @xmath21 in both non - radiative ( 0 jet ) and radiative ( 1 jet ) processes .",
    "they reasonably cancel each other . as a result ,",
    "the simulations show good stability against the variation in @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the remaining dependence shows the prediction uncertainty of our simulations .",
    "we show the results with extreme choices of @xmath46 ( dashed ) and @xmath47 ( dotted ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : grappa ] , where , though not important here , the renormalization scale ( @xmath22 ) is set to be equal to @xmath21 in order to achieve the matching in the radiation probability at the boundary .",
    "we can see that the variation in the simulation results is small , and the experimental results are well within this range .",
    "therefore , the @xmath21 value can be `` tuned '' if a more precise simulation is required , for instance , for acceptance and/or efficiency studies .",

    "[ fig : low - pt ] that the spectrum above @xmath53 gev/@xmath9 is not significantly altered by the pythia simulation .",

    "it does not contain any adjustable parameter that may alter physical spectra , except for the choice of eq .",
