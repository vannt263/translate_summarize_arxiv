    "the purpose of this paper is to use intersection theory techniques to define an invariant of closed 3-manifolds which will count the equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the fundamental group in @xmath0 .",
    "the invariant defined here may be viewed as a @xmath0 analog of the casson invariant .",
    "recall that the casson invariant counts equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the fundamental group in @xmath2 .",
    "this invariant has been generalized to count representations in a number of other groups . of particular interest for us",
    "are the generalizations to @xmath3 found in @xcite and to @xmath1 found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 invariant , like the casson invariant , has a surgery formula for rational homology spheres , as shown in @xcite",
    ". a surgery formula for most surgeries on knots in homology spheres for the @xmath1-invariant can be found in @xcite , as corrected in @xcite , and further calculations for the @xmath1-invariant can be found in @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath3 is isomorphic to @xmath4 . in @xcite ,",
    "this fact is used to relate the piece of the @xmath3-invariant which counts representations which lift to @xmath2 to the @xmath2-invariant , and eventually to compute the @xmath3-invariant .",
    "more specifically , we define the @xmath3-invariant of a closed 3-manifold @xmath5 to be a sum of invariants @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath6 counts the equivalence classes of representations @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , in the end it is shown that @xmath11 for every @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath12 and @xmath13 are isomorphic , it follows that the @xmath3-invariant is equal to the the @xmath2-invariant .    here",
    ", we will relate the portion of the @xmath0-invariant which counts representations which lift to @xmath1 to the invariant of @xcite in a similar fashion .",
    "again , we may define invariants @xmath6 counting the equivalence classes of irreducible @xmath0-representations @xmath8 with @xmath9 . as in the case of @xmath3",
    ", we will see that @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , however , in contrast to the @xmath3-theory , we will show that in general @xmath15 , so the @xmath0-invariant does _ not _ equal the @xmath1-invariant .    in section 2",
    ", we define the invariant @xmath16 , and in section 3 we establish several of its properties . in section 4",
    "we compute the @xmath0- and @xmath1-invariants for certain seifert fibered spaces and for certain surgeries on twist knots , and in section 5 we state several observations , questions , and conjectures concerning the invariant and its relationship to the @xmath1-invariant .",
    "given a finitely generated group @xmath17 , denote by @xmath18 the space of representations @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath20 has the structure of a complex affine algebraic set .",
    "( see @xcite , for example . )",
    "let @xmath21 denote the algebro - geometric quotient under the natural action of @xmath0 on @xmath18 .",
    "note that there is a surjective quotient map @xmath22 . by analogy with the @xmath1-theory ,",
    "we call the elements of @xmath21 the @xmath0-characters of @xmath17 .    a representation @xmath23 is _ reducible _ if it is conjugate to a representation whose image is upper triangular ; all other representations are _",
    "irreducible_. let @xmath24 denote the subspace of @xmath20 consisting of irreducible representations .",
    "let @xmath25 be the subspace of @xmath26 of characters of irreducible representations .",
    "given a manifold @xmath5 , we denote by @xmath27 the variety of @xmath0 representations of @xmath28 and by @xmath29 the associated character variety .",
    "suppose now @xmath5 is a closed , orientable 3-manifold with a heegaard splitting @xmath30 . here , @xmath31 is a closed orientable surface embedded in @xmath5 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are handlebodies with boundaries @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",
    "the inclusion maps @xmath36 and @xmath37 induce a pushout diagram @xmath38 this diagram induces a diagram of the associated representation varieties , where all arrows are reversed and are injective rather than surjective . on the level of character varieties ,",
    "this gives a pullback diagram @xmath39 this identifies @xmath40 as the intersection @xmath41    to generalize the casson invariant to @xmath0 , we should define an intersection number for @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "however the spaces involved are not manifolds , so we must do this carefully . to begin with , the spaces are stratified according to the reducibility of the characters .",
    "since we are primarily interested in counting irreducible characters , we may avoid this problem by defining an intersection number which counts only those characters which lie in compact subvarieties of @xmath45 .",
    "this is completely analogous to the approach taken in @xcite to define an invariant counting irreducible @xmath1 characters .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath1 theory the variety @xmath45 is not a manifold , but rather an orbifold .",
    "therefore we must define an orbifold intersection number , counting points in the intersection with weight @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the order of the stabilizer group .",
    "this is completely analogous to the approach taken in @xcite to define an invariant counting equivalence classes of irreducible @xmath3-representations .",
    "we now describe the orbifold structure on @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the subgroup consisting of the images of the diagonal matrices and the matrices @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the @xmath53-subgroup of @xmath54 .",
    "for an irreducible representation @xmath8 which is conjugate to a representation into @xmath55 , it is easy to check that @xmath0 does not act freely on the orbit @xmath56 , but rather acts with @xmath57-isotropy",
    ". similarly , if @xmath8 is conjugate to a representation onto @xmath52 , then @xmath0 acts with @xmath53-isotropy .",
    "however , @xmath0 does act freely on the orbits of all other irreducible representations .",
    "there are natural orientations on all the character varieties determined by their complex structures .",
    "the invariant @xmath16 is defined as an oriented orbifold intersection number of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in @xmath45 which counts only compact , zero - dimensional components of the intersection .",
    "specifically , there exist a compact neighborhood @xmath60 of the zero - dimensional components of @xmath61 which is disjoint from the higher dimensional components of the intersection and an isotopy @xmath62 supported in @xmath60 such that @xmath63 and @xmath59 intersect transversely in @xmath60 .",
    "this isotopy may not preserve the lower strata consisting of characters of representations into @xmath54 and into @xmath52 . to account for this",
    ", we count a character @xmath64 in @xmath65 with weight @xmath66 if @xmath64 is not the character of a representation that conjugates into @xmath54 , with weight @xmath67 if @xmath64 is the character of a representation which conjugates into @xmath54 but not into @xmath52 , and with weight @xmath68 if @xmath64 is the character of a representation which conjugates into @xmath52 .",
    "now set @xmath69 , depending on whether the orientation of @xmath63 followed by that of @xmath59 agrees with or disagrees with the orientation of @xmath45 at @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath70 where the sum is over all zero - dimensional components @xmath64 of the intersection @xmath65 .",
    "standard arguments show that the quantity @xmath16 is independent of the choice of isotopy used to define it and of the choice of heegaard splitting of @xmath5 .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite , for example . )",
    "thus we obtain    @xmath16 is a well - defined invariant of @xmath5 .",
    "also as in the @xmath1-theory , this definition agrees with the algebro - geometric intersection number .",
    "thus , for @xmath64 a zero - dimensional component of the intersection @xmath71 , if we define @xmath72 to be the coefficient of @xmath64 in the intersection cycle @xmath73 , we obtain    @xmath74 where the sum is taken over all zero - dimensional components of @xmath75 .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "we now establish some basic properties of the @xmath0 casson invariant . these follow quite easily from the definition and the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we show    the invariant @xmath76 has the following properties :    1 .   for any 3-manifold @xmath77 @xmath78",
    "if @xmath75 has at least one zero - dimensional component , then @xmath79 2 .   if @xmath5 is hyperbolic , then @xmath80 3 .",
    "if @xmath81 then there exists an irreducible representation @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath28 is cyclic , then @xmath83 4",
    ".   if @xmath5 is a @xmath57 homology 3-sphere , then @xmath84 5 .",
    "@xmath85 , where @xmath86 is @xmath5 with the opposite orientation . 6 .   for rational homology spheres @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we have @xmath89    1 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of definition 2.1 and theorem 2.3 . 2 .",
    "the hyperbolic structure on @xmath5 is a discrete , faithful , irreducible representation @xmath90 . by the main theorem of @xcite , the discrete",
    ", faithful representations form an open subset of @xmath40 . on the other hand , by mostow rigidity ,",
    "the discrete faithful representation in @xmath0 is unique .",
    "it follows that the character of the representation is isolated in @xmath40 , and thus @xmath75 contains a zero - dimensional component .",
    "hence ( ii ) follows from ( i ) .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of definition 2.1 .",
    "the quotient map @xmath91 induces orientation - preserving maps @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes the @xmath1-character variety .",
    "moreover the isotopy @xmath62 used to make @xmath42 transverse to @xmath43 induces an isotopy @xmath96 making @xmath97 transverse to @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a @xmath57-homology sphere , then the orientation - preserving map @xmath92 is an isomorphism of character varieties , and the maps @xmath93 and @xmath94 are local diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of an isolated intersection point @xmath99 .",
    "thus in fact @xmath84 5 .",
    "this follows immediately from definition 2.1 .",
    "any representation @xmath100 is in fact an ordered pair of representations @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 is not conjugate to @xmath101 in general . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath105 and @xmath106 are both nontrivial , we may use this fact to generate a curve of characters in @xmath107 containing @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the isolated characters in @xmath108 are characters of representations @xmath109 with @xmath110 an irreducible representation of @xmath111 and characters of representations @xmath112 with @xmath105 an irreducible representation of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the trivial representation .",
    "hence @xmath89    we remark that this connected sum formula is more elegant that the corresponding formula for the @xmath1-invariant . in @xcite it is shown that @xmath115 in contrast , the @xmath0-invariant is additive .",
    "we now study a number of examples which will help clarify the relationship between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-invariants .    in @xcite , the invariant @xmath116 is computed for @xmath5 a seifert fibered integral homology sphere and for @xmath5 the result of @xmath117-dehn surgery on a twist knot as long as @xmath117 is not a strict boundary slope for @xmath118 , where @xmath118 for @xmath119 denotes the @xmath120-twist knot in @xmath121 depicted in figure 1 below .",
    "moreover , the strict boundary slopes for @xmath118 are known and are all even . if @xmath5 is an integral homology sphere , then @xmath122 by theorem 3.1 ( iv ) .",
    "thus we have the following :     with a clasp and @xmath120 half twists.,height=124 ]    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath123 are positive integers that are pairwise relatively prime , and denote by @xmath124 the associated seifert fibered homology sphere",
    ". then @xmath125 2 .",
    "if @xmath5 is the result of @xmath117-dehn surgery on @xmath118 , where @xmath120 is even and @xmath126 is odd , then @xmath127 3 .",
    "if @xmath5 is the result of @xmath117-dehn surgery on @xmath118 , where @xmath120 is odd and @xmath126 is odd , then @xmath128    we now turn our attention to certain seifert fibered spaces which are not integral homology spheres . for seifert",
    "fibered spaces which are not @xmath57-homology spheres , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-invariants may differ .",
    "let @xmath5 be a non - haken seifert manifold whose base orbifold is of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 .    in @xcite , proposition d ,",
    "the authors compute the number of @xmath0 characters of @xmath131 .",
    "they note further that for all irreducible representations @xmath132 the cohomology group @xmath133 is zero . but arguing as in the proof of theorem 2.1 of @xcite , we find that the character of any such representation in @xmath75 is an isolated character with multiplicity 1 if it is not the character of a representation which conjugates into @xmath54 , with multiplicity 1/2 if it is the character of a representation which conjugates into @xmath55 , and with multiplicity 1/4 if it is the character of a representation which conjugates into @xmath52 .",
    "thus , in this setting , counting the characters of @xmath134 enables us to compute @xmath16 .",
