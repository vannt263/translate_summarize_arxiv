    "a morse @xmath0function on a smooth @xmath1manifold @xmath2 is a generic smooth map from @xmath2 to a @xmath0manifold , just as an ordinary morse function is a generic smooth map to a @xmath3manifold .",

    "we develop techniques for working with morse @xmath0functions and generic homotopies between them , paying particular attention to ( 1 ) avoiding _ definite folds _ , in which the modelling function @xmath5 is a definite morse singularity , i.e. a local extremum , and ( 2 ) guaranteeing connected fibers . when definite folds are avoided , we say that the morse @xmath0function ( or generic homotopy ) is _",

    "can be taken to be homotopic to given homotopies .",
    "the motivation for generalizing morse functions and cerf theory  @xcite from dimension one to dimension two comes originally from the importance of lefschetz fibrations in complex and symplectic geometry , and the new ideas around broken lefschetz fibrations .",
    "after lebrun  @xcite and honda  @xcite showed that a smooth @xmath49-manifold @xmath50 with @xmath51 has a _ near symplectic form _ ( a closed @xmath0-form @xmath52 with @xmath53 and zero only on a smooth embedded @xmath3-manifold @xmath54 in @xmath2 ) , auroux , donaldson and katzarkov  @xcite proved that such @xmath49-manifolds are lefschetz pencils in the complement of @xmath54 , where @xmath54 mapped onto latitudes of @xmath55 .",
    "gay and kirby  @xcite , lekili  @xcite , baykur  @xcite and akbulut and karakurt  @xcite extended this result to all smooth , oriented , compact @xmath49-manifolds as broken fibrations ( not just pencils ) .",
    "one aim was to define invariants by counting pseudo - holomorphic curves in @xmath50 which limit on @xmath54 , as had been done in the symplectic case by taubes  @xcite and usher  @xcite . to do this ,",
    "perutz  @xcite defined his lagrangian matching invariants for a broken lefschetz fibration , but to get invariants of the underlying smooth @xmath49-manifold , one needs _ moves _ between broken lefschetz fibrations , preserving connectedness of fibers , under which the lagrangian matching invariants are preserved . our uniqueness theorem is intended to provide these moves , and thus provide purely topological definitions of invariants .",
    "note that maps @xmath56 are partitioned according to their homotopy class into the elements of the cohomotopy set @xmath57 , calculated homotopically by taylor  @xcite and geometrically by kirby , melvin and teichner  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how this partitioning relates to known invariants , but all elements are realized by indefinite , fiber connected , morse @xmath0-functions .",
    "theorem  [ t : existence ] , in the case of @xmath58 and without fiber - connectedness , is originally due to saeki @xcite , who also pointed out that the finiteness of the index @xmath59 $ ] is a necessary condition . a short proof of existence for closed @xmath2 to @xmath55 is sketched in  @xcite . a significant step forward in the uniqueness case was provided by lekili  @xcite when he reintroduced singularity theory into the subject and showed how to go back and forth between lefschetz singularities and cusps on fold curves .",
    "of course there is an extensive history behind this paper in the world of singularity theory , which is too long to present , and an extensive history in complex algebraic geometry in the study of honest lefschetz fibrations .",
    "a purely topological precedent lies in the study of round handles ; see  @xcite and  @xcite , for example .",
    "theorem  [ t : uniqueness ] , when @xmath60 and without fiber - connectedness , was originally proved by williams  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ t:1existence ] is completely standard .",
    "the @xmath61valued ( cobordism ) case of theorem  [ t:1uniqueness ] is an essential ingredient in developing the calculus of framed links for @xmath62manifolds and thus appears in  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the fiber - connected assertion in the @xmath35valued case of theorem  [ t:1uniqueness ] is a new result , and was originally posed to us as a question by katrin wehrheim and chris woodward .",
    "if we remove the adjectives `` indefinite '' and `` fiber - connected '' from the above theorems then the theorems become simply the facts that morse functions , morse @xmath0functions , and generic homotopies between them are , in fact , generic .",
    "although in the above discussion we simply stated that morse functions , morse @xmath0functions and the homotopies we are calling `` generic '' are actually generic , in fact the definitions we prefer are in terms of local models , and the fact that maps and homotopies with these local models are generic ( and in fact stable ) is a standard result in singularity theory .    to prove theorems  [ t : existence ] and  [ t : uniqueness ] , we spend most of our time on the case where @xmath63 , the disk , and in fact think of @xmath64 as the square @xmath65 . here",
    "the natural structure on the @xmath1dimensional domain @xmath2 of a morse @xmath0function @xmath66 is that of a cobordism with sides from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , where @xmath67 is an @xmath69dimensional cobordism from @xmath70 to @xmath71 and @xmath68 is an @xmath69dimensional cobordism from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "this is attached to the @xmath111-sphere bundle ( which is the boundary of the normal line bundle to @xmath104 in @xmath109 ) , and this @xmath111-sphere can be placed where convenient . in our case",
