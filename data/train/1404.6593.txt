    "the radio pulse from a pulsar can be temporally broadened by multipath scattering in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the scattered light rays traverse a longer path than the rays propagating directly between the pulsar and the observer , and the concomitant time delay forms a scattering tail on the observed pulse .",
    "when the pulsed intensity is averaged over many rotations of the star , the observed pulse shape is the convolution of the intrinsic pulse shape with the impulse response of the scattering medium ( lee & jokipii 1975 ) .",
    "the analytical form of the impulse response is determined by the distribution of scattering material between the pulsar and the observer ( williamson 1972 , 1973 ) .",
    "if the scattering material is concentrated in a region that is thin in comparison to the distance between the pulsar and the observer and the plasma inhomogeneities in it follow a gaussian power spectrum , the impulse response is a truncated exponential characterized by a scattering timescale , @xmath0 ( cronyn 1970 ; lee & jokipii 1975 ) .",

    "free electrons in the ism cause the broad - band radio pulse to be dispersed in time , with high frequency pulses arriving earlier than low frequency ones .",
    "the frequency dependence of the pulse arrival times follows a cold plasma dispersion law .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is characterized by the dispersion measure ( dm ) , which is the electron density integrated along the line of sight to the pulsar . since dm can be accurately measured , and only varies slowly with time if at all , its effects can be removed for the most part in constructing pulsar average profiles .",
    "pulsar dms and scattering timescales , which vary with both dm and frequency ( e.g. bhat et al . 2004 ) , tend to be larger for those pulsars within the galactic plane and at large distances .",
    "dm measurements and independent estimates of pulsar distances can be used to construct models of the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; cordes & lazio 2002 ) .",
    "the models can be extended to include interstellar scattering using the scattering timescales extracted from pulsar average profiles ( e.g. cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ; bhat et al .",
    "2004 ) .",

    ", the scattering timescale should follow a power law , @xmath1 , where the frequency scaling index is @xmath2 if the plasma inhomogeneities in the scattering medium follow a gaussian power spectrum and @xmath3 for a kolmogorov spectrum ( lee & jokipii 1975 ; rickett 1977 ) .",
    "multi - frequency observations of pulsars indicate the measured values of @xmath4 are generally consistent with the theoretical ones ( komesaroff et al .",
    "1972 ) , although smaller scaling indices have been reported for highly dispersed pulsars ( lhmer et al . 2004",
    "; bhat et al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting a more uniform distribution of the scattering material and that the plasma inhomogeneties are non - gaussian , perhaps following lvy - cauchy statistics ( boldyrev & gwinn 2005 ) . the frequency dependence of the intrinsic pulse width is also modeled as a power law with a scaling index in the range of 0.14 to 0.45 , depending upon the model assumptions ( thorsett 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "the model of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) , for example , assumes the magnetic field in the emission region is dipolar in shape , the radiation is emitted at the local plasma frequency that varies with height in the magnetosphere , and the angular extent of the radiation is determined by the last field line to close within the star s corotating magnetosphere .",
    "these assumptions have led to the popular concept of a radius - to - frequency mapping ( cordes 1978 ) with the pulse width varying with frequency as @xmath5 . in general , pulse profiles",
    "are observed to widen with decreasing frequency .",
    "observed values of the width s frequency scaling index , however , lie in the range of about 0 to 1 , and the width can tend towards a constant value at high frequency ( rankin 1983 ; thorsett 1991 ) . owing to the different scaling indices in the frequency dependencies of the intrinsic width and scattering timescale ,",
    "the observed pulse shape is heavily influenced by multipath scattering at low radio frequencies ( @xmath6 mhz ) , while it is essentially a replica of the intrinsic shape at high frequencies ( @xmath7 ghz ) . at moderate frequencies ( @xmath8 ghz ) ,",
    "the pulsar s scattering timescale and intrinsic width can have comparable weight in shaping the observed pulse waveform .",
    "instrument related effects can also broaden the radio pulse in time .",
    "wide bandwidth observations of pulsars are separated into narrow frequency channels to compensate for the effects of interstellar dispersion .",
    "the dispersion smearing of the pulse over this narrow detection bandwidth leads to a dispersion impulse response @xmath9 characterized by a frequency - dependent timescale , @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , detection circuitry in the radio telescope does not necessarily respond instantaneously to the pulse .",
    "it , too , has an impulse response , @xmath11 , with a time constant , @xmath12 .",
    "the observed pulse , @xmath13 , is then a convolution of the intrinsic pulse , @xmath14 , with the impulse responses of both the scattering medium , @xmath15 , and the instrument .",

    "all have done so by computing the convolution numerically on an iterative basis and assuming functional forms for the instrumental impulse response functions .",
    "the first method adopts the thin screen approximation for @xmath15 , assumes the intrinsic pulse shape is a gaussian , or sum of gaussians , computes the convolution given by equation  [ eqn : obspulse ] numerically , and solves for the pulse width and scattering timescale iteratively with a least squares fit of the observed profile to the computed profile ( e.g. ramachandran et al . 1997 ; mitra & ramachandran 2001 ; lhmer et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "a second method uses fourier inversion to deconvolve the intrinsic pulse shape from the impulse responses of the instrument and ism .",
    "since the fourier transform of a convolution of functions is the product of their fourier transforms ( bracewell 1986 ) , one can compute the intrinsic pulse profile by assuming an @xmath15 , dividing the fourier transform of the observed profile by the fourier transform of @xmath15 , and fourier transforming the result back to the time domain .",
    "kuzmin & izvekova ( 1993 ) demonstrated this method using different scattering functions .",
    "bhat , cordes , & chatterjee ( 2003 ) developed a third method that makes no assumptions regarding the specific functional form of the intrinsic pulse shape and uses a clean - based algorithm to determine the scattering timescale iteratively by requiring the deconvolved intrinsic profile to have minimum asymmetry \" and non - negative values of total intensity .",
    "the method also adopts the thin screen approximation for @xmath15 .",

    "( 2004 ) extended this method to include a scattering function that corresponds to a uniformly distributed scattering medium with a square - law structure function .",
    "more recently , demorest ( 2010 ) demonstrated a fourth method for determining the scattering function and intrinsic pulse profile that is based upon cyclic spectral analysis .",
    "traditional spectral analysis procedures assume the pulsar signal is stationary over the timescale of the observation and only utilize the signal s amplitude .",
    "demorest recognized that the pulsar signal is more accurately described as cyclo - stationary , allowing one to use the signal s amplitude and phase to determine @xmath15 and @xmath14 without any assumptions regarding their functional forms . applying the method to psr b1937 + 21",
    ", demorest found the shapes of its pulse components to be gaussian - like , while @xmath15 was comprised of an exponential decay followed by a slowly decaying tail .",
    "as undeniably powerful as this method is , it can be computationally expensive , and recent work , such as that for fast radio bursts ( thornton et al .",
    "2013 ) , continues to use the more traditonal methods described above to estimate scattering timescales .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that simple analytical solutions to equation  [ eqn : obspulse ] exist in the specific case where the intrinsic pulse shape is gaussian and @xmath15 is the truncated exponential for a thin scattering screen .",

    "the pulse broadening problem posed by the multiple convolutions in equation  [ eqn : obspulse ] has an analytical solution when @xmath14 is gaussian , @xmath15 is a truncated exponential , and @xmath11 and @xmath9 are any combination of gaussians , truncated exponentials , and delta functions .",

    "thus , they assume the instrumental impulse responses are delta functions ( @xmath26 ) , and equation  [ eqn : tempbroad ] is the analytical form of the numerical model they adopted . similarly , lhmer et al .",

    "therefore , equation  [ eqn : tempbroad ] is the analytical form of their numerical model for their coherently dedispersed data .",
    "bhat , chatterjee , & cordes ( 2003 ) suggest the term @xmath37 is itself a convolution of many different truncated exponentials and effectively invoke the central limit theorem to argue that its functional form is gaussian .",
