    "in recent times a significant amount of research effort has been directed towards nonsmooth bifurcations because a large number of physical and engineering systems have been found to exhibit this class of bifurcation phenomena @xcite .",
    "such physical systems are generally given by two or more sets of differential equations , and the system switches from one set to another when some switching conditions are satisfied .",
    "it has been shown that such systems give rise to piecewise smooth maps , where the discrete - time state space is divided into two or more compartments with different functional forms of the map , separated by borderlines @xcite . a new type of bifurcation , called _",
    "border collision bifurcation _ occurs when a fixed point collides with a borderline , resulting in an abrupt change in the jacobian matrix .",
    "most past studies on border collision bifurcations have concentrated on piecewise smooth maps that are continuous across the borderlines @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been found that some switching dynamical systems , for example , the colpitts oscillator @xcite , dc - dc converters @xcite , thyristor controlled reactor circuits @xcite , sigma - delta modulators @xcite and many other electronic circuits @xcite give rise to discontinuous maps .",
    "discontinuity in the map arises if , in the @xmath0 dimensional poincar section there exists an @xmath1 dimensional manifold such that infinitesimally close points at the two sides of the manifold map to points that are far apart . in order to explain the bifurcation phenomena in such systems ,",
    "it is necessary to have a bifurcation theory for discontinuous maps .",
    "the bifurcation theory for 1d and 2d continuous piecewise smooth maps has been developed in @xcite . in another important line of work ,",
    "feigin obtained some results on the existence of periodic orbits in @xmath0-dimensional piecewise smooth continuous maps , which were brought to the notice of the english speaking audience in @xcite .",
    "the theory for discontinuous maps is in the preliminary stage of development , with some progress reported for one - dimensional maps in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we follow feigin s approach in case of discontinuous maps , and present new results that are applicable to the general @xmath0-dimensional case .",
    "in particular , we present the conditions of existence of the period-1 and period-2 fixed points which form the basis of the observable bifurcation phenomena in such maps . for this purpose",
    ", we use a piecewise linear normal form where the discontinuity is defined by two parameters .",
    "finally , the application of these results is illustrated by deducing the bifurcation behavior of a two - dimensional discontinuous map , and validating the results by simulation .",
    "we consider discontinuous maps of the form @xmath2 where the discrete - time phase space is divided into two regions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the functional forms of the map in the two regions respectively .",
    "since our points of interest are the occurrence of bifurcations with the traversal of a fixed point across the border , we can study the same by applying local linear approximation in neighborhood of the discontinuity : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 here @xmath10 is @xmath11th iteration of @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 matrices , @xmath17 is @xmath12 matrix and @xmath18 are parameters .    we can apply a suitable coordinate transformation to obtain the matrices in the normal form , where the matrices @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] are such that @xmath21 if @xmath22 , i.e. , except the first columns of the matrices all other columns are same . in the earlier work on piecewise smooth continuous maps @xcite this condition was required to ensure continuity of the map . in the present work , though we are considering discontinuous maps , we retain this property of the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath15 and move the discontinuity to the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 without loss of generality . in @xcite",
    "the length of the discontinuity was considered to be constant . in this paper , in order to allow a variable length of the discontinuity , we have used two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath26 to be same on both sides , which physically means that the two parameters have proportional effect on the two sides of the border .",
    "let us consider two fixed points @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the sub - mappings @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the first components of @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "we define @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath16 identity matrix . and @xmath40 . ]",
    "assuming @xmath41 and @xmath42 to be invertible , we find    @xmath43 ,    @xmath44 .    now",

    "now , since in the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath51 if @xmath22 , the cofactor of first column of @xmath52 and @xmath42 are same . hence @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are the elements of the first rows of the matrices @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively and @xmath58 are the elements of the column matrix * c*.    using the above in ( [ gen1m1m2 ] ) we obtain @xmath59    we require @xmath60 for @xmath61 to exist and @xmath62 for @xmath63 to exist . with the help of above derivations we can now attempt a classification of the possible behavior at the border collision bifurcation .",
