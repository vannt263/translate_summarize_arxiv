    "this paper applies our general theory of nonuniform fluids , described in several earlier publications @xcite , to the liquid - vapor interface of the simple lennard - jones fluid .",
    "our approach here can be viewed as a generalization of the classical van der waals ( vdw ) theory for the density profile of the liquid - vapor interface @xcite that ( a ) incorporates accurate thermodynamic data for the uniform fluid and ( b ) corrects the usual assumption that the interface profile is slowly varying .",
    "the new theory takes account of nonlocal molecular scale density correlations in a very natural way and can be applied to a wide variety of problems where the classical theory would fail .",
    "this perspective also provides a new and physically suggestive interpretation of the classical vdw theory for even a slowly - varying liquid - vapor interface that removes many of the conceptual problems and ambiguities that arise in standard descriptions @xcite .",
    "thus it seems appropriate to refer to it as a _ molecular scale _ van der waals ( mvdw ) theory @xcite .",
    "since many aspects of the mvdw theory have been presented in some detail in previous work , here we will just outline the main features and focus on the new results we find for the structure and thermodynamics of the liquid - vapor interface . in this specific application where the interface is often slowly varying , correction ( a )",
    "plays the most important role and ( b ) is relatively less important , though conceptually ( b ) represents the most important advance and permits much more general application of the theory . in particular we will show how our theory , which first determines the structure of the liquid - vapor ( lv ) interface , can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties such as the surface tension .",
    "these results will be compared to data from computer simulations @xcite and to a simplified version of the mvdw theory that includes only correction ( a ) .",
    "we also discuss the role of capillary wave fluctuations @xcite , which should be taken into account when comparing theory and experiment .",
    "an essential ingredient in the mvdw theory and in our interpretation of the classical vdw theory is the introduction of an effective single particle potential or `` molecular field '' to describe the locally averaged effects of the unbalanced attractive forces in the nonuniform lj fluid @xcite .",
    "since the attractive interactions are relatively slowly varying , such an averaged treatment seems physically reasonable . to that end ,",
    "the lj pair potential @xmath0 is separated into rapidly and slowly varying parts associated with the intermolecular _ forces _ so that all the harshly repulsive forces arise from @xmath1 and all the attractive forces from @xmath2 we describe the lv interface using a _ grand ensemble _ with a fixed chemical potential @xmath3 and temperature @xmath4 giving two phase coexistence with bulk liquid and vapor densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively in an external field @xmath7 .",
    "the theory then approximates the structure of the nonuniform lj system by that of a simpler nonuniform `` reference '' or `` mimic '' system at the same temperature but with a chemical potential @xmath8 and purely repulsive pair interactions @xmath9 .",
    "these give the same repulsive intermolecular forces as in the lj fluid and are well approximated for most purposes by hard sphere interactions .",
    "the nonuniformity in the reference system is induced by an appropriately chosen _ effective reference field _ ( erf ) @xmath10 that is supposed to take into account the locally averaged effects of the attractive interactions in the lj fluid .",
    "how should @xmath10 be chosen ?",
    "since we want the reference fluid structure to approximate that of the full fluid to the extent possible , it seems reasonable to determine @xmath10 formally by the requirement that the local ( singlet ) densities at every point @xmath11 in the two fluids are equal @xcite : @xmath12,\\mu _ { 0}^{\\ell } ) = \\rho ( \\mathbf{r};[\\phi ] , \\mu ^{\\ell } ) .",

    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , we can derive the classical vdw interface equation from this starting point by making two additional approximations .",
    "we briefly discuss this interpretation of the classical theory and then describe how our new mvdw theory improves on both approximations .",

    "this is just a transcription of the usual molecular field equation for the ising model to a continuum fluid with attractive interactions @xmath21 and can be derived in a number of different ways @xcite .",
    "the connection to the unbalanced attractive forces is perhaps most clearly seen in the derivation in @xcite , which starts from a formally exact description of the force balance in a nonuniform fluid and arrives at eq .",
    "( [ mfeqn ] ) by a series of physically motivated approximations .    for the lv interface we have @xmath22 , but it is convenient in what follows to keep a general @xmath16 which we will then set to zero . in that case",
    "we will also choose @xmath8 so that the density @xmath23 of the uniform reference fluid with @xmath24 equals @xmath5 . with this choice the erf@xmath13 vanishes on the liquid side far from the interface where the density becomes equal to @xmath25    another special case of eq .",

    "thus it naturally produces a modified `` van der waals loop '' in the two phase region and seems quite appropriate for our use here in improving the simplest mf description of the uniform fluid .",
    "now we relate this accurate @xmath27 to the known @xmath28 through a function @xmath57 defined so that @xmath58 thus the exact chemical potentials in the uniform lj and reference systems are related in the same way as is predicted by the simple mf approximation of eq .",
