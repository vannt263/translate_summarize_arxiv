    "the simplest decay of any quarkonium vector state occurs through its annihilation into a virtual photon , which produces a lepton or quark - antiquark pair .",
    "a leptonic width of a vector state offers a measure of wave function overlap at the origin thus providing information about interactions of quarks composing the vector meson . for these reasons , decays to lepton pairs are heavily studied and used to characterize the most basic features of each vector state .",
    "the present analysis is devoted to a measurement of the @xmath0(1020 ) leptonic width @xmath9 .",
    "previously it has been measured by various methods in a number of experiments . in refs .",
    "@xcite the leptonic width was determined in a direct study of @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays , while in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 was evaluated from the simultaneous fit of four major decay modes of the @xmath0(1020 ) meson .    in this work we present a new measurement of the @xmath0(1020 ) leptonic width using a combined fit of four main @xmath0(1020 ) decay modes @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite and @xmath15  @xcite , studied with the cmd-2 detector  @xcite at the vepp-2 m @xmath2 collider  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of the processes @xmath16 , previously measured in the experiments  @xcite are listed in tables  [ tab : kpkm ]    [ tab : etag ] .",
    "the errors of the cross sections in the tables are statistical only .",

    "the errors of the cross section are statistical only . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to determine the leptonic width and branching fractions taking into account systematic errors",
    ", we use the maximum likelihood method with the following likelihood function : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the experimental value of the cross section for the process @xmath20",
    "( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 the value of the theoretical cross section for the process @xmath20 , subscript @xmath26 counts an `` individual '' part of a systematic error in the cross section of the process @xmath20 and @xmath27 denotes a common part of the systematic error in measurements of the kaon cross sections , while @xmath28 means a common part of systematic errors for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 studies .",
    "the following values have been obtained from the maximization procedure : @xmath29 where errors of the parameters are experimental ( i.e. , include statistical and systematic uncertainties ) .    to determine the statistical errors of the parameters separately ,",
    "the same fit has been performed with @xmath30 and @xmath31 fixed at zero .",
    "the following values have been obtained : @xmath32    as one can see , the central values of the parameters from the last fit are slightly shifted with respect to the results of the previous fit . using monte - carlo simulation",
    "it was checked that a variation of the shape of the likelihood function shifts the `` true '' value of the leptonic width by @xmath33 kev , while taking into account correlations between the systematic errors leads to changing the @xmath34 input value by @xmath35 kev .",
    "so , the obtained value of the @xmath36 kev should be corrected by this shift .",
    "thus our final result for the @xmath0(1020 ) leptonic width is : @xmath37 the assumption of su(2 ) and su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite used to calculate the @xmath38 contributions is valid within @xmath3920% accuracy . to estimate a systematic error due to the choice of the fitting model we performed a fit with the @xmath0(1020 ) contribution only in the @xmath40 channels .",
    "the obtained differences in the values of the fitting parameters were less than 0.5% and used as a model systematic error .",
    "contributions to the systematic error due to uncertainties in parameters used as fit constants ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , ... ) are at the level of 10@xmath45 .    in plots of fig .",

    "the following values of the branching fractions have been obtained :    @xmath49    the obtained value of the @xmath0(1020 ) leptonic width is smaller than the value in the previous cmd-2 measurement  @xcite by about one experimental error reflecting a decrease of the total width of the @xmath0(1020 ) meson .",
    "the value of the @xmath0(1020 ) meson leptonic width obtained here is correlated to the values of the four major @xmath0(1020 ) branching fractions and therefore should not be included in the constrained fit performed by pdg .",
