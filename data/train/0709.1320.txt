    "sn1987a was the closest observed supernova in 380 years , and the evolution of the remnant of this supernova has been studied in great detail over the past twenty years . the radio intensity is growing and its rate of increase is increasing , with the spectral index being observed to flatten @xcite .",
    "imaging at radio wavelengths has enabled the expansion of the inner ring to be traced , and is revealing increasing structure in the inner ring .",
    "the x - ray fluxes observed with xmm and chandra also continue to rise almost exponentially @xcite .",
    "around @xmath14000 days after the supernova the x - ray light curve increased dramatically , attributed to the arrival of the supernova blast wave at the equatorial ring of circumstellar material .",
    "there is some evidence that the x - ray flux is mainly thermal , indicating the blast - wave interaction with dense matter @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared radio and x - ray data with their calculations and concluded that there is a high ( amplified ) magnetic field inside the supernova remnant . the predicted tev gamma - ray flux , resulting mostly from the decay of neutral pions produced in interactions of the accelerated cosmic rays , is almost one order below the level obtained in previous searches by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as cangaroo - ii in 2001 @xcite and h.e.s.s .  in 2003",
    "the wide field of view searched by h.e.s.s .",
    "did , however , yield marginal excesses in a region north - east of sn 1987a and at lmc x-1 .",
    "cangaroo - iii is one of two stereoscopic iacts located in the southern hemisphere . with a three - fold coincidence",
    ", the sensitivity is significantly improved from the previous single telescope ( cangaroo - ii ) .",
    "we also increased the observation period by a factor of two in the 2006 observations compared to the 2004 and 2001 seasons .",
    "we here report the results of these observations .    the previous h.e.s.s .",
    "analysis considered not only sn 1987a but also four other high energy objects within the same field of view @xcite .",
    "we follow that idea and present upper limits on the integral gamma - ray fluxes from the super - bubble 30  dor  c , the crab - like pulsar psr b0540@xmath069 , the x - ray binary lmc x-1 , and the supernova remnant n157b .",
    "super - bubbles are expected to be efficient accelerators of cosmic rays @xcite and a shell feature near the star 30  dor  c , within 5 arcmin of sn 1987a , shows an indication of non - thermal hard x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the energy required to produce the bubble is estimated to be 7@xmath210@xmath3erg , which is higher than generally expected for a single supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the other three sources belong to categories of high - energy astrophysical objects that may accelerate particles to tev energies , but , considering their large distance of 50kpc , they are less likely to be detected by current iacts than their galactic counterparts . however , as they are well within the field of view of the cangaroo - iii telescopes , and given the marginal h.e.s.s .",
    "excess toward lmc x-1 , it is straightforward to search for any evidence of gamma - ray emission from them .",
    "the cangaroo - iii stereoscopic system consists of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes located near woomera , south australia ( 31@xmath4s , 137@xmath4e ) .",
    "each telescope has a 10 m diameter segmented reflector consisting of 114 spherical mirrors each of 80 cm diameter @xcite , providing a total light collecting area of 57.3m@xmath5 .",
    "the spherical segments are mounted on a parabolic frame with a focal length of 8 m .",
    "the first telescope , t1 , which was the cangaroo - ii telescope @xcite , was not used for these observations due to its smaller field of view and higher energy threshold .",
    "the second , third , and fourth telescopes ( t2 , t3 , and t4 ) were used for the observations described here .",
    "the camera systems for t2 , t3 , and t4 are identical and are described in @xcite .",
    "the telescopes are located at the east ( t1 ) , west ( t2 ) , south ( t3 ) and north ( t4 ) corners of a diamond with sides of @xmath1100 m @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out in the periods from 2004 nov 11 to 14 ( mjd 5332053323 ) and from 2006 dec 12 to 27 ( mjd 5408154096 ) using  wobble mode \" in which the pointing position of each telescope was shifted in declination between @xmath60.5 degree every 20 minutes @xcite from the target : ( ra , dec [ j2000 ] ) = ( 83.866139@xmath4 , @xmath069.269577@xmath4 ) .",
    "we took no off source runs .",
    "the most sensitive region of the field of view is within one degree of the average pointing position .",
    "lmc  x-1 is located 0.6 degrees south - east from sn  1987a .",
    "considering our angular resolution of 0.24 degree , there is some overlap between sn 1987a , 30  dor  c , psr b0540@xmath069 , and n157b .    in the 2004 observation ,",
    "data with gps time stamps were recorded for t2 , t3 and t4 individually when more than four photomultiplier ( pmt ) signals exceeded 7.6 photoelectrons ( p.e . ) . in the offline analysis stage",
    "we combined the data when the three telescope s gps times coincided . in the 2006 observation ,",
    "a hardware coincidence was used to select any two triggered telescopes @xcite .",
    "the images in all three telescopes were required to have clusters of at least five adjacent pixels exceeding a 5p.e .",
    "threshold ( offline three - fold coincidence ) .",
    "the event rate was reduced to 5@xmath18hz by this criterion depending on the elevation angle and year . based on time dependence of these rates",
    "we can remove data taken in cloudy conditions .",
    "the effective observation times for 2004 and 2006 were 632 and 1316 min , respectively .",
    "the corresponding mean zenith angles were 42.1@xmath4 and 40.0@xmath4 .",
    "the light collecting efficiencies , including the reflectivity of the segmented mirrors , the light guides , and the quantum efficiencies of the photomultiplier tubes were monitored by a muon - ring analysis @xcite with the individual trigger data in the same periods .",
    "the light yield per unit arc - length is approximately proportional to the light collecting efficiencies .",
    "deterioration is mostly due to dirt and dust settling on the mirrors .",
    "here , we briefly describe the analysis procedures , which are identical with those described in @xcite .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , the image moments @xcite were calculated for the three telescopes .",
    "the incident gamma - ray direction was determined by minimizing the sum of squared widths ( @xmath7 : weighted by the photon yield ) of the three images seen from the assumed position ( fitting parameter ) with a constraint on the distances from the intersection point to each image center .    in order to derive the gamma - ray likeliness",
    ", we used the fisher discriminant ( hereafter @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "input parameters were @xmath9 where @xmath10 are energy - corrected @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the t2 , t3 , and t4 and assume that a linear combination of @xmath13 provides the best separation between signal and background , then the set of linear coefficients ( @xmath14 ) should be uniquely determined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a vector of the mean value of @xmath17 for each sample and @xmath18 is their correlation matrix .",
    "we previously used it in vela pulsar analysis @xcite to separate `` sharp '' ( gamma - ray  like ) images from `` smeared '' ( background ) ones .",
    "the values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 can be calculated from the monte - carlo and observational data ( off - source runs ) , respectively .",
    "we rejected events with any hits in the outermost layer of a camera (  edge cut \" ) .",
    "these rejected events suffer from finite deformations , especially in the @xmath23 distribution , which results in deformations of the @xmath8 .",
    "we then derived @xmath8 distributions position by position .",
    "comparing those in the signal region and control background region , we can determine the gamma - ray  like events .",
    "here , we use monte - carlo simulations to determine the @xmath8 distribution of gamma - ray signals .",
    "note that in the gamma - ray simulations we used a spectrum proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the fit of the @xmath8 distribution of source position with the above emulated signal and control background functions were carried out , to derive the number of gamma - ray  like events .",
    "this is a one - parameter fitting with the constraint that sum of signal and background events corresponds to the total number of events .",
    "these coefficients can be derived exactly analytically .",
    "the threshold of this analysis is considered to be @xmath11tev which is higher than the typical cangaroo - iii threshold due to the larger zenith angle of the observations , of around 40 degrees . in order to derive morphology",
    ", we segmented the field of view into 0.2@xmath20.2 degree@xmath5 square bins .",
    "the @xmath8 distributions for corresponding bins are made and fitted .",
    "the control - background region is defined as the second closest layer , which is more than 0.3 degree from the center of target region , i.e. , larger than the 0.24 degree point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the statistics of the control - background is , therefore , sixteen times larger than that of signal bin .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "-3 cm -1 cm    the left panel is obtained from the 2004 data and the right from 2006 .",
    "the average telescope pointing position is indicated by the cross centered and labeled as ",
    "sn 1987a \" , with the other four high energy objects within this field of view indicated by crosses .",
    "our sensitivity is considered to be limited up to one degree in radius from the center .",
    "the psf is considered to be a 0.24 degree radius circle .",
    "the significance distributions ( excess divided by the statistical error ) are approximately normal ( gaussian ) distributions .",
    "the best fit gaussians have mean values of @xmath00.31@xmath60.08 ( 2004 ) and @xmath00.18@xmath60.09 ( 2004 ) , and standard deviations of 1.21@xmath60.06 ( 2004 ) and 1.31@xmath60.06 ( 2006 ) , within systematic uncertainties .",
    "at first we investigate the region of sn 1987a .",
    "note that this region at some energies is contaminated by 30  dor  c , a highly energetic source . to indicate the excess distribution from its center , we show so - called @xmath25 distributions in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    here",
    ", the control - background sample was selected in the region @xmath25=(0.10.2 ) [ degree@xmath5 ] .",
    "the background - subtracted signals are shown .",
    "both 2004 and 2006 data have statistically insignificant excesses near @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28dofs ( degree of freedom ) for null assumptions are 18.6/15 and 13.2/15 for 2004 and 2006 , respectively .",
    "these statistically insignificant excesses appear as the small excess count peaks around the centers of the plots in fig .",
    "note that our psf corresponds to @xmath290.06 degree@xmath5 .",
    "we , therefore , proceed assuming that there is no signal present . in order to show the consistency between 2004 and 2006 ,",
    "the vertical unit is unified to count rate .    in order to determine whether or not there is a gamma - ray excess around sn 1987a",
    ", we made the @xmath8 distributions within the psf .",
    "the control - background was made from the region @xmath25=(0.10.2 ) .",
    "the fitting results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the background level differs between the two years .",
    "this is due to sky conditions , mirror reflectivity , time - dependence of the blur spot size ( which improves after maintenance periods ) , etc .",
    "these are considered to be the major systematics for estimating the observational gamma - ray flux in this work . for the light correction efficiency",
    ", we may have 10% uncertainty at maximum .",
    "again there is no statistically significant excess .",
    "we carried out a similar analysis , year by year , energy threshold by energy threshold .",
    "the obtained 2@xmath30 upper limits ( uls ) are listed in table  [ table1 ] .    .the",
    "2@xmath30 upper limits to the integral fluxes from sn1987a at two epochs with three different energy thresholds . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these are two year averages .",
    "note that , considering our psf of 0.24 degree , sn 1987a and 30  dor  c are highly confused , with other pairs being less confused . also some of the control - background regions are confused .",
    "the acceptance is a slowly and smoothly decreasing function and is reduced to 65% at a distance of one degree from the center .",
    "our morphology indicates a negligibly small excess near the center of field of view both in the 2004 and 2006 data .",
    "this is statistically @xmath312@xmath30 each year .",
    "we note that a similar feature can also be seen in the h.e.s.s .",
    "data shown in figs .  2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "a deep survey , i.e. , longer observation , around this region is awaited .",
    "the region around lmc x-1 is consistent with zero in our data .",
    "the upper limits of sn 1987a in table  [ table1 ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the results presented here ( in blue and black ) are compared with cangaroo - ii ( red ) @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "( green ) @xcite results .",
    "the upper limits in this work are improved by factors of up to 10 on the 2001 result .",
    "that is consistent with the longer observation time and better signal - to - noise ratio resulting from the three - fold coincidence .",
    "however , the theoretical prediction even 7300 days after the supernova ( the dashed curve ) @xcite is still a factor of three below the results of the observations . note that the predictions @xcite were made in the frame of spherical symmetric approach .",
    "the existence of strongly asymmetric interstellar matter structure , which is a dense inner ring , makes their prediction of gamma - ray flux uncertain . according to their rough estimation ,",
    "this uncertainty is not very large ( about a factor of 2 ) due to the stronger supernova shock deceleration in the denser medium .",
    "the solid curve is their prediction for 8249 days after the supernova , still lower than the upper limits obtained in this work . in order to constrain this model , we need further improvements on the hardware and/or analysis methods . a deeper observation by h.e.s.s .",
    ", such as t@xmath3230 h , around @xmath12010 might give conclusive results .",
    "also proposed future large - scale iact arrays such as cta @xcite would be very promising .",
    "the limit obtained for 30  dor  c in table  [ table2 ] is about 15% crab level at @xmath11tev . considering the distance of 50kpc to lmc",
    ", this upper limit corresponds to a huge cosmic - ray density comparing with that of the crab nebula ( distance of 2kpc ) .",
    "even if there is supernova complex there , the expected tev gamma - ray flux is still below our sensitivity limit . increasing the cosmic - ray target density such as either inter - stellar - matter or photon density within plausible ranges",
    ", the expected flux does not exceed this high upper limit . according to the standard estimation on the hadronic gamma - ray production such as @xcite with an assumption of the target density of 1p/@xmath33",
    ", a total kinetic explosion energy of @xmath34ergs gives a 1 milli - crab flux of gamma - rays at the solar system .",
    "again future larger - scale projects are required to probe such flux levels .    for the other three high energy objects , we set upper limits far below those of previous observations .",
    "we , however , could not find any physically important constraints on their activity at high energies again due to the distance of 50kpc .",
    "we have observed sn 1987a at two epochs : mjd 5332053323 ( 2004 nov ) and mjd 5408154096 ( 2006 dec ) , approximately 6500 and 7200 days after the supernova , respectively .",
    "the effective observation times are 10.5 and 20h , respectively .",
    "no statistically significant gamma - ray signals were obtained and we set 2@xmath30 upper limits on the integral fluxes of 617% crab at @xmath11tev .",
    "these are slightly lower than the previous cangaroo - ii and h.e.s.s.upper limits .",
    "although theory predicts a factor of @xmath353 lower flux 7300 days after supernova , it also predicts that the future flux level might exceed the sensitivity limit of the existing and future arrays",
    ". continued monitoring of this object at tev energies is still therefore meaningful in constraining theoretical models .",
    "it is also important to improve the sensitivity of the observation methods , as proposed by the cta project @xcite .",
    "in addition , we set 2@xmath30 upper limits for four more high energy objects inside our field of view : 30  dor  c ( super bubble ) , psr b0540@xmath069 ( crab - like pulsar ) , lmc x-1 ( x - ray binary ) , and n157b ( supernova remnant ) .",
