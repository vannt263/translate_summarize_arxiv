    ", the pseudo - codewords will also depend on the transmitted sequence .",
    "in this section , we present simulation results for two ldpc codes on the precoded dicode channel ( pdic ) and use those results to predict the error rate well beyond the limits of our simulations .",
    "both codes are @xmath107-regular binary ldpc codes ; the first has length 155 and the second has length 455 .",
    "the parity - check matrices were chosen randomly except that double - edges and four - cycles were avoided . since the performance depends on the transmitted codeword , the results were obtained for 3 randomly chosen codewords of fixed weight .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] .",
    "the solid lines represent the simulation curves while the dashed lines represent a truncated union bound .",
    "the truncated union bound is obtained by computing the generalized euclidean distances associated with all decoding errors that occurred at some low snr points ( e.g. , wer of roughly than @xmath108 ) until we observe a stationary generalized euclidean distance spectrum .",
    "this high wer allows the decoder to rapidly discover jd - pcws .",
    "the dash - dot curves show the state - based joint iterative message - passing decoder ( jimpd ) algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that lp joint - decoding outperforms jimpd by about 0.5db at wer of @xmath109 .",
    "the lp decoding is performed in the dual domain because this is much faster than the primal when using matlab . due to the slow speed of lp decoding still",
    ", simulations were completed up to a wer of roughly @xmath110 .",
    "it is well - known that the truncated bound should be relatively tight at high snr if all the dominant jd - pcws have been found .",
    "the final complication that must be discussed is the dependence on the transmitted codeword .",
    "it is known that long ldpc codes with joint iterative decoding experience a concentration phenomenon @xcite whereby the error probability associated with transmitting a randomly chosen codeword is very close , with high probability , to the average error probability over all transmitted codewords .",
    "we note that this effect starts to appear even at the short block lengths used in this example .",
    "more research is required to understand this effect at moderate block lengths and to verify the same effect for lp decoding .",
    "in this paper , we present a novel linear - programing ( lp ) formulation of joint decoding for ldpc codes on fscs that offer decoding performance improvements over joint iterative decoding .",
