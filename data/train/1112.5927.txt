    "glauber dynamics  @xcite is one of the simplest ways to implement the ordering dynamics of ising spin systems , which is defined such that detailed balance holds at equilibrium described by the canonical ensemble .",
    "when an ising system evades analytical explanation , we can numerically construct the equilibrium ensemble of the system by running glauber dynamics until the steady state is reached .",
    "however , one may ask whether the ensemble created by glauber dynamics faithfully represents the equilibrium ensemble of the ising system , a question that needs to be addressed case by case with caution .    the answer is negative when the dynamics occurs at zero temperature .",

    "[ fig : self_averaging ] .",
    "we note that both peaks are self - averaging : the mean values show signs of saturation , and the widths seem to decay asymptotically like @xmath60 .",
    "hence , in the thermodynamic limit , we claim that almost all the samples belong to two sharp peaks whose positions are determined solely by @xmath1 . here follows detailed descriptions for the analysis of each peak .",

    "figure  [ fig : self_averaging](a ) shows that the value of @xmath63_{l}$ ] decreases with @xmath1 , and approaches positive limits as @xmath0 grows .",
    "this is consistent with the lower bound of @xmath7 in the thermodynamic limit derived by hggstrm  @xcite which is positive and decreases with @xmath1 in the parameter range observed in our simulations .",
    "the vertical drops of @xmath7 indicate that the peak becomes too sharp and too close to zero at smaller values of @xmath0 , so @xmath63_{l}$ ] becomes indistinguishable from zero in those ranges .    figure  [ fig : self_averaging](b ) shows that the value of @xmath64 has a crossover between two scaling regimes : @xmath65 and @xmath60 . as pointed out in previous paragraphs , the left peak is so narrow for small values of @xmath0 that its width is just given by the unit of @xmath7 , which is inversely proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 gets larger , the unit of @xmath7 decays faster than the true peak width , revealing the @xmath60 dependence .",

    "[ fig : self_averaging](c ) clearly shows that @xmath63_{r}$ ] saturates as @xmath0 grows and increases with @xmath1 , @xmath66 exhibits more complicated behaviors as shown in fig .",

    "the curves are increasingly well - fitted by @xmath60 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we claim that @xmath69 decays somewhat like @xmath60 , but deviates from it around the regime where the left peak is just about to disappear ( or , equivalently , just about to appear ) . the data for @xmath70 in fig .",
    "[ fig : self_averaging](d ) and the distribution shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig : la_dist](b ) give a nice illustration of our claim .",
    "when @xmath0 is small , the two peaks are clearly distinguishable , so the @xmath60 behavior is easily observed . as @xmath0 grows , the left peak dwindles and the left component becomes indistinguishable from the right component of the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "this makes @xmath69 appear broader than it really is as we include part of the left component in the right component by mistake , hence @xmath69 appears to decay slower than @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath0 grows more , the left peak becomes completely unobservable , causing the rapid width decay and the subsequent return to the @xmath60 behavior .",
    "if we had observed the system at greater @xmath0 , the curve for @xmath71 would also have shown the rapid width decay and the subsequent return to the @xmath60 behavior as was shown by the curve for @xmath72 .",
    "taking all those considerations into account , we conclude that both components of @xmath44 are self - averaging .              based on the results presented so far",
    ", we claim that the @xmath7 distribution in the thermodynamic limit can be represented as a combination of at most two delta peaks .",
    "the nature of the left peak is easily understood : it represents the samples that almost reach the ground state , with a small ( but still finite ) fraction of active links connecting dangling parts of the system .",
    "however , we pose the following question : why should there be another well - defined peak at a much larger value of @xmath7 ?    in order to check whether the er network is the only substrate with the observed right - peak behavior , we also test zero - temperature glauber dynamics in the regular random network where all nodes have the same degree @xmath73 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rightmean](a ) .",
    "it is remarkable that zero - temperature glauber dynamics in even - degree regular random networks never produces any `` right peak '' ( only a single peak is formed at or around @xmath8 , which may be called the `` left peak '' ) , which is why the data are not plotted at even values of @xmath1 .",
    "this seems to be due to large fluctuations provided by blinkers that can appear only in even - degree nodes . on the other hand",
    ", odd - degree regular random networks produce results very similar to er networks .",
    "lack of degree fluctuations in odd - degree regular random networks yields only small vertical offsets of @xmath63_{r}$ ] , not significantly altering the right - peak properties observed in er networks .",

    "the sake of convenience , let us denote the latter by a new notation @xmath63_r^l$ ] . since @xmath7 always decreases with time in glauber dynamics , samples initialized by @xmath76 can not produce right peaks at values of @xmath7 larger than @xmath76 . therefore ,",

    "is in order .",
    "those samples are constructed from zero - magnetization spin configurations by random flippings of spins that decrease @xmath79 .",
    "it should be noted that this method does not scan the entire configuration space of the samples characterized by @xmath76 , since the magnetization of each sample prepared by the method is likely to be very close to zero .",
    "however , since the samples belonging to the right component have magnetization close to zero in the absorbing states , our initialization method still serves the purpose of generating samples that are similar to the right - component samples but different only in the value of @xmath7 .    figure  [ fig : rightmean](b ) indeed confirms our previously described expectation : the samples with @xmath77_r$ ] have @xmath63_r^l = [ \\langle l_a\\rangle]_r$ ] , while the right peak disappears in the samples with @xmath80_r$ ] ( the right peak may still remain for a few more steps of @xmath1 as the right peak produced by samples with @xmath75 does have a tail to the left of @xmath81_r$ ] , which is smaller than @xmath76 ) .",
    "this indicates that the value of @xmath81_r$ ] is indeed physically meaningful since it is the only value of active link density that can be sustained when the magnetization of the system is close to zero .",
    "now we discuss how the fate of each sample is determined , or what determines whether the system evolves into the left or the right component of the @xmath7 distribution .",
    "such sample - to - sample fluctuations come from three factors : different network structures , different initial configurations , and the stochasticity of dynamics .",
    "we separate the effect of network structure from that of the other factors .",
    "a natural parameter describing the broadness of the @xmath7 would be its variance , which we may define in the following two ways : @xmath82 - \\left[\\langle l_a \\rangle\\right]^2 , \\\\",
    "\\sigma'^2 & = \\left[\\langle l_a^2\\rangle -\\langle l_a \\rangle^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath83 $ ] represents an average over different network realizations , and @xmath84 represents an average over the other factors sharing the common network structure .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 is the variance of @xmath7 that does not distinguish between contributions from the three factors mentioned above . on the other hand",

    "taking those three points as possible indicators of the critical value of @xmath43 at which the left peak is barely observable , we observe that all the three values increases indefinitely with @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kc ] ) .",
    "this implies that as @xmath0 goes to infinity , the @xmath7 distribution is single - peaked at any finite @xmath1 , and that the peak is far away ( as it is actually the `` right '' peak ) from @xmath8 .",
    "hence , this observation again supports our previous claim that the right peak is actually the only lasting peak in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in summary , we have studied the absorbing states of zero - temperature glauber dynamics in quenched er - type random networks with zero - magnetization initial states .",
    "each absorbing state has been represented by its active link density @xmath7 .",
    "we have found that the structure of the @xmath7 distribution consists of two self - averaging peaks , the left one with samples almost reaching the ground state and the right one with samples divided by large stable domain walls .",
    "the mean of the left - peak ( right - peak ) component seems to be a monotonically decreasing ( increasing ) function of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we focus on the finite - size scaling analysis of various physical properties for @xmath101 , which suggests that the fraction of the right - peak component stays finite in the thermodynamic limit , even if the value of @xmath1 is pretty high .",
    "we have also gathered circumstantial evidence that the right peak is actually the only lasting peak in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our results also have some implications on opinion dynamics studies",
    ". some earlier studies of zero - temperature glauber dynamics as an opinion dynamics model have simply assumed that when there are sufficiently many links , the portion of samples that do not reach the ground state becomes negligible .",
    "thus , they measured `` consensus time , '' which is the time required for the sample to reach the ground state in order to obtain the scaling relationship between the system size and the speed of relaxation .",
    "we suggest that consensus time is not a suitable measure since almost all the samples fail to reach the ground state in the thermodynamic limit and increasingly many of them end up far away from the ground state as @xmath1 gets larger  @xcite .",
    "data collapse shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : separation ] ( the results of @xcite as well ) is a better numerical approach to such a problem .",
    "the final location of the right peak is very well - defined and it seems to represent the only value of @xmath7 that yields stable up - down symmetric configurations .",
    "therefore , interfacial noise that causes sufficiently large fluctuations in @xmath7 always drives the system out of absorbing states and helps them relax to the ground state , as illustrated by the role played by blinkers in even - degree regular random networks .",
    "this leads us to expect that there should be an analytical argument for the location of the right peak , which we unfortunately could not formulate . as the right peak observed in odd - degree regular random networks",
    "shows a qualitatively similar behavior , an intuitive argument for the nature of the right peak in one substrate may help us understand the corresponding phenomenon in the other substrate .",
    "finally , we have shown that the properties of @xmath101 are not much affected by either the particular network structure or initial configuration , where both peaks can be reached purely from the stochasticity of dynamics .",
    "this may be due to the characteristic homogeneity of er networks , as any randomly generated er network in any randomly chosen symmetric initial configurations is likely to be very similar to another er network prepared in the same way",
    ". it would be interesting to check whether the same observation can be made for more topologically heterogeneous substrates such as scale - free networks .",
    "one should note that this argument for the `` irrelevance of structure and configuration '' should be taken carefully . as uchida and shirayama",
    "have shown  @xcite , the biased choice of initial configuration does affect the properties of @xmath101 .",
    "the contributions from such exceptional cases are negligible in the unbiased ensemble of samples we have considered in this paper .",
