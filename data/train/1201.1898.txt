    "<S> in particular , @xmath0 values that are roughly constant across modes are indicative of dissipation at the anchor points ; dissipation originating deep in the string , on the other hand , should lead to @xmath0 that decays inversely with the resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the former behavior is consistent with our understanding that the relative contribution @xmath37 is likely to be small in high stress materials .    </S>",
    "<S> thermomechanical calibration allows us to quantitatively compare these loss channels . </S>",

    "<S> a more precise statement of the predicted frequency dependence is as follows : the spectral density of the squared displacement is @xmath55 the corresponding displacement @xmath56 over an arbitrary frequency interval @xmath57 goes as @xmath58 the fit shown in fig .  </S>",
