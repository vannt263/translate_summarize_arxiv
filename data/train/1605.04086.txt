    "maxwell s equations on the whole three - dimensional space are considered with initial conditions and inhomogeneity having support in a bounded domain that is not required to be convex ( or in a finite collection of such domains ) .",
    "the study of such problems leads to transparent boundary conditions , which yield the restriction of the solution to the domain .",
    "such boundary conditions are nonlocal in space and time , for both acoustic wave equations and maxwell s equations .",
    "there is a vast literature to tackle this problem in general for wave equations : fast algorithms for exact , nonlocal boundary conditions on a ball @xcite , local absorbing boundary conditions @xcite , perfectly matched layers , which were originally considered for electromagnetism in @xcite , and numerical coupling with time - dependent boundary integral operators @xcite .",
    "all the above approaches , except the last one , are inadequate for non - convex domains .",
    "the local methods fail because waves may leave and re - enter a non - convex domain .",
    "inclusion of a non - convex domain in a larger convex domain is computationally undesirable in situations such as a cavity or an antenna - like structure or a far - spread non - connected collection of small domains .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to transfer the programme of @xcite from acoustic wave equations to maxwell s equations : to propose and analyze a provably stable and convergent fully discrete numerical method that couples discretizations in the interior and on the boundary , without requiring convexity of the domain . like abboud _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( and later also @xcite ) for the acoustic wave equation , we start from a symmetrized weak first - order formulation of maxwell s equations . in the interior",
    "this is discretized by a discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) method in space @xcite together with the explicit leapfrog scheme in time @xcite .",
    "the boundary integral terms are discretized by standard boundary element methods in space and by convolution quadrature ( cq ) in time @xcite .",
    "this yields a coupled method that is explicit in the interior and implicit on the boundary .",
    "the choice of a cq time discretization of the boundary integral operators is essential for our analysis , and to a lesser extent also the choice of the leapfrog scheme in the interior .",
    "however , our approach is not specific to the chosen space discretizations which could , in particular , be replaced by conformal edge elements @xcite .",
    "while the general approach of this paper is clearly based on @xcite , it should be emphasized that the appropriate boundary integral formulation requires a careful study of the time - harmonic maxwell s equation .",
    "this is based on @xcite , with special attention to the appropriate trace space on the boundary and to the corresponding duality . due to the analogue of green s formula for maxwell s equations",
    ", the duality naturally turns out to be an anti - symmetric pairing .",
    "the calderon operator for maxwell s equation , which arises in the boundary integral equation formulation of the transparent boundary conditions , differs from the acoustic case to a large extent , and therefore the study of its coercivity property is an important and nontrivial point . similarly to the acoustic case , the continuous - time and discrete - time coercivity is obtained from the laplace - domain coercivity using an operator - valued version , given in @xcite , of the classical herglotz theorem @xcite .",
    "both the second and first order formulation of maxwell s equations are used .",
    "the spatial semi - discretization of the symmetrized weak first - order formulation of maxwell s equations has formally the same matrix",
    " vector formulation as for the acoustic wave equation studied in @xcite , with the same coercivity property of the calderon operator .",
    "because of this structural similarity , the stability results of @xcite , which are shown using the matrix  vector setting , remain valid for the maxwell case without any modification . on the other hand ,",
    "their translation to the functional analytic setting differs to a great extent .",
    "therefore further care is required in the consistency analysis .",
    "in section  [ section : recap helmholtz ] we recapitulate the basic theory for maxwell s equation in the laplace domain .",
    "based on buffa and hiptmair @xcite , and further on @xcite , we describe the right boundary space , which allows for a rigorous boundary integral formulation for maxwell s equations . then the boundary integral operators are obtained in a usual way from the single and double layer potentials . in section [ section : calderon ]",
    "we prove the crucial technical result of the present work , a coercivity property of the calderon operator for maxwell s equation in the laplace domain .",
    "this property translates to the continuous - time maxwell s equations later , in section  [ subsection : calderon op for maxwell s eqn ] , via an operator - valued herglotz theorem .",
    "in section  [ section : boundary int form ] we study the interior  exterior coupling of maxwell s equations , resulting in an interior problem coupled to an equation on the boundary with the calderon operator .",
    "we derive a first order symmetric weak formulation , which is the maxwell analogue of the formulation of @xcite for the acoustic wave equation . together with the continuous - time version of the coercivity property of the calderon operator , this formulation allows us to derive an energy estimate . later on this analysis",
    "is transfered to the semi - discrete and fully discrete settings .",
    "section  [ section : discretization ] presents the details of the discretization methods : in space we use discontinuous galerkin finite elements with centered fluxes in the domain @xcite , coupled to continuous linear boundary elements on the surface .",
    "time discretization is done by the leapfrog scheme in the interior domain , while on the boundary we use convolution quadrature based on the second - order backward differentiation formula .",
    "an extra term stabilizes the coupling , just as for the acoustic wave equation @xcite .",
    "the matrix ",
    "vector formulation of the semidiscrete problem has the same anti - symmetric structure and the same coercivity property as for the acoustic wave equation , and therefore the stability results shown in @xcite can be reused here .    in sections  [ section : semidiscrete results ] and [ section : fully discrete results ]",
    "we revise the parts of the results and proofs of @xcite where they differ from the acoustic case , which is mainly in the estimate of the consistency error .",
    "finally , we arrive at the convergence error bounds for the semi- and full discretizations .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the proposed numerical discretizations in this paper are the first provably stable and convergent semi- and full discretizations to interior  exterior coupling of maxwell s equations .",
    "we believe that the presented analysis and the techniques , which we share with @xcite , can be extended further : to other discretization techniques for the domain , such as edge element methods @xcite , higher order discontinuous galerkin methods , and different time discretizations in the domain , together with higher order runge  kutta based convolution quadratures on the boundary @xcite .",
    "for ease of presentation we consider only constant permeability and permittivity .",
    "however , it is only important that the permeability and permittivity are constant in the exterior domain and in a neighbourhood of the boundary . in the interior",
    "these coefficients may be space - dependent and discontinuous . in the latter case",
    "the equations can be discretized in space with the dg method as described in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the appropriate boundary integral formulation and on the numerical analysis of the proposed numerical methods .",
    "numerical experiments are intended to be presented in subsequent work .",
    "concerning notation , we use the convention that vectors in @xmath0 are denoted by italic letters ( such as @xmath1 ) , whereas the corresponding boldface letters are used for finite element nodal vectors in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ( large ) number of discretization nodes .",
    "hence , any boldface letters appearing in this paper refer to the matrix  vector formulation of spatially discretized equations .",

    "this becomes possible because we show here that the coercivity and the matrix formulation   of the discretization are of the same type for both maxwell and the acoustic case . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the consistency errors depends strongly on the functional - analytic setting and is different for discretizations of maxwell s equations and the acoustic wave equation .",
    "we thank two anonymous referees for their helpful comments .",
    "we are grateful for the helpful discussions on spatial discretizations with ralf hiptmair ( eth zrich ) during a birs workshop ( 16w5071 ) in banff .",

    "<S> maxwell s equations are considered with transparent boundary conditions , for initial conditions and inhomogeneity having support in a bounded , not necessarily convex three - dimensional domain or in a collection of such domains . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical method only involves the interior domain and its boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the transparent boundary conditions are imposed via a time - dependent boundary integral operator that is shown to satisfy a coercivity property . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of the numerical method relies on this coercivity and on an anti - symmetric structure of the discretized equations that is inherited from a weak first - order formulation of the continuous equations . </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed here uses a discontinuous galerkin method and the leapfrog scheme in the interior and is coupled to boundary elements and convolution quadrature on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the method is explicit in the interior and implicit on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> stability and convergence of the spatial semidiscretization are proven , and with a computationally simple stabilization term , this is also shown for the full discretization . </S>"
