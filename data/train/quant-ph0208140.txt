    "the discovery of powerful , fast quantum algorithms @xcite launched new efforts to implement such quantum algorithms in real physical systems .",
    "quantum algorithms simultaneously exploit two characteristic features of quantum theory .",
    "namely , the fundamental phenomenon of quantum interference and the fact that for distinguishable quantum systems the dimension of the hilbert space increases exponentially with the number of systems .",
    "therefore , to implement a quantum algorithm in a real quantum system we must be able to create and manipulate arbitrary superpositions of quantum states and to preserve quantum coherence during a computation . unfortunately , quantum coherence is very fragile .",
    "typically , any coupling to an environment leads to decoherence so that quantum mechanical superpositions are rapidly destroyed .",
    "the urgent need to develop efficient methods to protect quantum coherence has led to the study of very general classes of quantum error - correcting codes @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to restrict the dynamics of a quantum algorithm to a subspace of the hilbert space , in which errors can be identified uniquely by suitable measurements and where the error operators can be inverted by unitary operations .",
    "typically , this is achieved by an encoding of the logical information and by a suitable choice of quantum gates .",
    "for some special cases it is also possible to design a passive error - correcting quantum code @xcite .",
    "such a passive quantum code relies on a subspace of the hilbert space which is not affected by any errors at all .",
    "in this situation the unitary recovery operation is the identity operation so that an active correction of the errors is not necessary .    in principle",
    ", any type of error can be corrected by these strategies as long as enough physical qubits are available to achieve the required redundancy and one can make a large number of control measurements and perform the rapid recovery operations .",
    "however , in view of current - day experimental possibilities @xcite it is generally difficult to achieve both requirements .",
    "therefore it is desirable to develop alternative error - correcting strategies which possibly correct a restricted class of errors only , but which tend to minimize both redundancy and the number of recovery operations .",
    "recently , the first steps in this direction have been taken by defining a new class of one _ detected jump - error correcting quantum codes _ which are capable of stabilizing distinguishable qubits against spontaneous decay processes into statistically independent reservoirs @xcite .",
    "these codes are constructed by embedding an active error - correcting code in a passive code space and by exploiting information available on error positions .",
    "this embedding procedure leads to a significant reduction of redundancy and the number of control measurements and recovery operations .    in this paper",
    "the physical principles underlying detected jump - error correcting quantum codes are explored and generalized , motivated by the practical need for quantum error - correcting codes which minimize both redundancy and the number of recovery operations . based on these physical principles an upper bound is established on the number of logical states of a general embedded detected jump - error correcting quantum code .    from this",

    "these considerations are the starting point for the development of optimal strategies of error correction , which we pursue in the subsequent sections .",
    "we consider a model of a quantum computer in which @xmath0 two - level atoms ( qubits ) interact with external laser pulses which synthesize the quantum gates underlying a quantum algorithm .",
    "these @xmath0 qubits are assumed to be arranged in an array with well defined positions @xmath1 @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ iontrap2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , these @xmath0 qubits are assumed to be distinguishable , which requires that their mean nearest neighbor distance is large in comparison with the optical wave lengths involved .",
    "their distinguishability guarantees that the dimension of their associated hilbert space is @xmath3 and thus scales exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that these @xmath0 qubits couple to the unoccupied modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this coupling causes spontaneous decay processes of the qubits from their excited states @xmath4 , to their stable lower lying states @xmath5 . within",
    "the born , markov , and the rotating wave approximations the resulting dynamics of the reduced density operator @xmath6 of this @xmath0-qubit system are described by the master equation @xcite @xmath7 with the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath8 thereby , the coherent dynamics of the @xmath0-qubit system in the absence of the coupling to the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field are described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 which incorporates the influence of the external laser pulses . in addition , we assume that the mean distance between the qubits is much larger than the wave lengths of the spontaneously emitted radiation . therefore , to a good degree of approximation each qubit @xmath10 couples to a different set of modes of the radiation field so that these sets constitute statistically independent reservoirs @xcite . in eq .",

    "the measurement record @xmath24 is observed with probability @xmath28 . according to eq .",
    "( [ unravel ] ) the quantum state @xmath29 resulting from a particular measurement record is determined by two types of effects .",

    "second , immediately after the spontaneous emission of a photon by qubit @xmath10 the quantum state is modified by the lindblad operator @xmath32 .",
    "this distinction between the two different types of dynamics is crucial for the development of a useful quantum error - correcting strategy which minimizes the redundancy as well as the number of control measurements and recovery operations .",
    "in this section we introduce the main ideas leading to the construction of optimal one detected jump - error correcting embedded quantum codes which are capable of stabilizing systems of distinguishable qubits against spontaneous decay processes .",
    "these quantum codes exploit the physical possibilities which are offered by the continuous observation of the distinguishable qubits by photodetectors .",
    "how can we stabilize an @xmath0-qubit system , such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ iontrap2 ] , against spontaneous decay processes if we can observe the qubits continuously with the help of photodetectors ? to achieve this two major tasks have to be tackled .",
    "namely , we have to correct the modifications taking place during successive photon emission events .",
    "these modifications are described by the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ effective hamiltonian ] ) . and , we have to invert each quantum jump @xmath33 caused by the spontaneous emission of a photon by qubit @xmath10 .    in principle",
    ", the errors taking place during two successive photon emission events can be corrected by an active error - correcting quantum code with a sufficiently rapid sequence of control measurements and recovery operations @xcite .",
    "however for practical applications such an approach is not very attractive .",
    "one faces all the problems which are related to the implementation of large numbers of control measurements and recovery operations .",
    "it is therefore much more desirable to develop passive error - correcting methods for stabilizing the @xmath0-qubit system against modifications arising from the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ effective hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the main idea is to determine an appropriate subspace @xmath34 of the hilbert space of the @xmath0 distinguishable qubits in which the perturbing part of the hamiltonian acts as a multiple of the unit operator , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes a c - number .",
    "( in our setting this number is real - valued and positive . )",
    "if the ( unperturbed ) dynamics characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath9 do not take an initial pure quantum state outside this decoherence free subspace @xmath34 , this condition implies that , provided no photon is emitted in the time interval @xmath31 $ ] , the quantum state at time @xmath20 is identical with the unperturbed state ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ unravel ] ) ) .",
    "thus , if one can find such a sufficiently high dimensional decoherence free subspace , the dynamics taking place between successive spontaneous photon emission events are stabilized perfectly without the need for control measurements and recovery operations . in practice",
    "it is desirable to choose the dimension of the decoherence free subspace to be as large as possible .",
    "an important special case occurs when all the @xmath0 qubits have identical spontaneous decay rates , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "in this situation it follows that @xmath38 and any subspace formed by basis states involving an equal number , say @xmath39 , of excited qubits is a decoherence free subspace . for a given number of @xmath0 qubits the dimension @xmath40 of such a decoherence free subspace",
    "is given by @xmath41 which is maximal if @xmath42 .",
    "( @xmath43 denotes the largest integer smaller or equal to @xmath44 . )    in general , the first spontaneous emission of a photon will affect the quantum state of the @xmath0-qubit system in an irreversible way . according to eq .",
    "( [ unravel ] ) the spontaneous emission of a photon by qubit @xmath10 , for example , is described by the application of the lindblad operator @xmath32 which induces a quantum jump @xmath33 .",
    "this lindblad operator is not invertible over the decoherence free subspace @xmath34 so that this quantum jump can not be corrected . in order to correct for this quantum jump",
    "actively we have to restrict the dynamics to a still smaller subspace @xmath45 in which a unitary operator , say @xmath46 , can be found having the property @xmath47 therefore , if we still want to take advantage of passive error correction between successive photon emission events we have to construct an active error - correcting quantum code within the relevant decoherence free subspace .",
    "we now construct a one detected jump - error correcting embedded quantum code in the special case of identical spontaneous decay rates considered above . according to the criterion given in @xcite , the orthogonal basis states @xmath48 of a subspace @xmath49 constitute an active error - correcting quantum code with respect to the set of error operators",
    "@xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 for all possible values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "( [ knill ] ) states the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of unitary recovery operations which fulfill eq .  ( [ recovery ] ) for the error operators @xmath50 . in the physical setting",
    "this criterion states that : ( i ) different orthogonal quantum states remain orthogonal under the action of error operators ; and ( ii ) all basis states are affected by a given pair of errors @xmath32 and @xmath54 in a similar way .",
    "the latter condition necessarily implies that the scalar products between the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are state - independent .",
    "it is plausible that a larger set of error operators leads to a more restrictive set of conditions of the type of eq .",
    "( [ knill ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we also expect that more restrictive conditions lead to a higher redundancy of an active quantum code .",
    "as an example , consider the situation where continuous observation of the @xmath0-qubit system by photodetectors does not reveal which qubit @xmath10 has emitted the registered photon .",
    "this implies that the error operators which could induce a spontaneous decay process are in the set @xmath57 .",
    "it has been shown by plenio et al .",
    "@xcite that when the error positions are unknown , eight physical qubits are needed to encode two orthogonal logical states by an embedded quantum code .",
    "this should be compared with the optimal active one - error correcting code using five qubits @xcite .",
    "thus , the advantage offered by using an embedded quantum code , capable of passively correcting errors between successive photon emission events leads to a significant increase of redundancy in comparison to purely active methods .",
    "however , this disadvantage can be overcome if besides knowing the error time , information about the error position @xmath10 is also available . in principle",
    ", this information can be obtained from continuous observation of the @xmath0-qubit system by photodetectors as long as the mean distance between adjacent qubits is large in comparison with the wave length of the spontaneously emitted radiation . for this purpose",
    "it is important that each photon which is emitted by one of the qubits can be detected .",
    "how can we construct a one detected jump - error correcting embedded quantum code which exploits information about the error position in an optimal way so that its redundancy is minimized ?",
    "let us concentrate again on our previously introduced example of identical spontaneous decay rates . in this",
    "setting we have a decoherence free subspace which involves @xmath58 excited qubits .",
    "this stabilizes the dynamics between successive photon emission events passively .",
    "for example , in the simple case of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the orthogonal basis states @xmath61 of the decoherence free subspace are given by latexmath:[$\\{|1100\\rangle , |0011\\rangle , |1010\\rangle , |0101\\rangle ,    free subspace a possible active quantum code , capable of correcting one quantum jump at a time at a known position @xmath10 , is determined by the following three orthonormal code words : @xmath63 these code words are formed by all possible different pairs of basis states of the decoherence free subspace which can be constructed by interchanging states @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these complementary pairings are also characterized by equally weighted probability amplitudes which involve an arbitrary phase @xmath66 .",
    "it can be easily checked that this embedded quantum code fulfills the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ knill ] ) for any of the lindblad operators @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ jump operator ] ) separately , but not for two different lindblad operators with @xmath67 .",
    "thus , provided that the error time and the error position are known this embedded quantum code can correct one quantum jump at a time .",
    "in addition , errors between successive quantum jumps are corrected passively . in this way",
    "the number of control measurements and recovery operations is reduced and so is the redundancy .",
    "this is apparent by comparing our quantum code with the code proposed by plenio et al .",
    "@xcite , which requires eight physical qubits for the encoding of two orthogonal quantum states .",
    "the above construction based on complementary pairings can be generalized to an even number @xmath0 of physical qubits ; giving an infinite family of one detected jump - error correcting embedded quantum codes .",
    "the construction is the following .",
    "we start from the highest dimensional decoherence free subspace which involves all quantum states in which half of the qubits are excited to states @xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , we construct an active quantum code within this decoherence free subspace by complementary pairings .",
    "the dimension @xmath68 of the resulting embedded quantum code is given by @xmath69 it is a remarkable fact that , provided one wants to correct errors passively between successive quantum jumps , it is not possible for an even number of physical qubits @xmath0 to reduce the redundancy of such an embedded jump code ( see sec .",
    "[ designs ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore , our family of embedded quantum codes has the desirable feature that it minimizes redundancy and that it requires only a small number of recovery operations .",
    "for instance , in a given time interval , say @xmath31 $ ] , the mean number @xmath21 of required recovery operations is of the order of @xmath70 .    to stabilize any quantum algorithm against spontaneous decay processes using an embedded one detected jump - error correcting quantum code three requirements have to be met .",
    "first , one has to be able to register the time @xmath20 and position @xmath10 of each spontaneous decay event which takes place during the performance of the quantum algorithm .",
    "as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ iontrap2 ] this can be achieved by continuous observation of the @xmath0-qubit system with photodetectors . in principle , an identification of the perturbed qubit @xmath10 is possible provided the mean nearest neighbor spacing of the qubits is large in comparison with the wave lengths of the radiation emitted spontaneously . however , in practice the error position @xmath10 might not be determined so easily due to imperfect detection efficiencies of the photodetectors .",
    "therefore , in actual applications shelving techniques @xcite might be useful which amplify each spontaneously emitted photon to such an extent that it can be detected with an efficiency arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "second , we have to ensure that each spontaneous decay event is corrected immediately by application of an appropriated unitary transformation which inverts the effect of the lindblad operator @xmath32 . in practice",
    ", this inversion has to be performed on a time scale which is small in comparison with the natural time scale of the quantum algorithm and with the mean spontaneous decay time .",
    "third , one has to ensure that the sequence of quantum gates which constitute the quantum algorithm does not leave the code space at any time .",
    "this can be done by encoding the logical information within the code space , and to develop a universal set of quantum gates which leaves this code space invariant .",
    "ideally these quantum gates are implemented by suitable hamiltonians .",
    "this ensures that the code space is left invariant even during the application of one of these universal quantum gates .",
    "such universal sets of hamiltonian - induced quantum gates have already been developed for decoherence free subspaces @xmath34 of the kind discussed above @xcite .",
    "but in general , unitary gates based on swapping hamiltonians need not be universal on the embedded quantum code , or the swapping hamiltonians do not leave the embedded quantum code invariant .",
    "the solution of this intricate and yet unsolved problem is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , some preliminary results have already been obtained recently  @xcite .",
    "so far we have shown that any lindblad operator @xmath32 of the form of eq .",
    "( [ jump operator ] ) can be inverted by our one detected jump - error correcting quantum codes .",
    "we provide an example of a unitary transformation which achieves this inversion in the case of the one detected jump - error correcting quantum code involving four physical qubits .",
    "a possible sequence of quantum gates capable of inverting a spontaneous decay process affecting qubit @xmath71 , for example , is depicted in fig .",
    "this example demonstrates the basic fact that it is indeed possible to perform a unitary inversion of the lindblad operator @xmath72 provided eq .",
    "( [ knill ] ) is fulfilled for @xmath73 .",
    "to define general detected jump - error correcting quantum codes , we introduce some notation . for a set of positions @xmath74 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the operator @xmath76 the associated error times @xmath77 are no longer mentioned explicitly , but it is understood that they are known .",
    "note that the operators @xmath78 commute , because the @xmath26 are pairwise different . since by eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) , the errors which involve two equal indices , say @xmath79 , can not occur .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ codedesign ] , for @xmath80 all the states which are superpositions of states with a constant number of excited qubits are common eigenstates of the non - unitary effective time evolution ( [ heffective ] ) between quantum jumps .",
    "a subspace @xmath81 of such a decoherence free subspace with orthonormal basis @xmath82 is called a @xmath83-detected jump - error correcting quantum code , and is denoted by @xmath84 if the following condition holds for sets @xmath85 of jump positions with at most @xmath83 elements and for all basis states @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 the notation @xmath89 is motivated by classical coding theory .",
    "similarly , the notation @xmath83-jc@xmath90 is motivated by notations from design theory ( see @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , in this simulation the full hilbert space of four physical qubits has to be taken into account . as a measure of fidelity the squared absolute value of the overlap between the state @xmath188 after a time @xmath189 and the initial state @xmath190 of the memory",

    "[ detdelay ] demonstrates that , as long as the delay between detection and correction is not too large compared with the mean decay time , error correction is still possible .",
    "another important condition for correct implementation of a detected jump - error correcting quantum code is the ability to observe the environment of each qubit _ continuously_. however , immediately after the detection of a spontaneous emission event , typically the detector is not able to respond to another photon . during the latent response time of a photodetector",

    "this information is obtained by continuously monitoring the system .",
    "errors caused by the resulting non - unitary dynamics are corrected passively by embedding the error - correcting code in a decoherence free subspace . to construct such codes",
