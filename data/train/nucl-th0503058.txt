    "recently , there has been much progress in the experimental search for the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "while there are many indications suggesting the presence of a very dense matter produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite , a very important question is whether the produced dense matter is a quark - gluon plasma . if it is a quark - gluon plasma , it will undergo a phase transition from the quark - gluon plasma phase to the hadronic phase .",
    "it is desirable to search for the signature for the phase transition of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the signature for the phase transition however depends sensitively on the order of the transition .",
    "previously , it was suggested by witten and many other workers that a granular structure of droplets occurs in a first - order qcd phase transition , and the observation of the granular structure can be used as a signature for a first - order qcd phase transition @xcite .    in a recent analysis",
    ", a granular emitting source of droplets was put forth to explain the hbt interferometry puzzle for nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "the suggestion was based on the observation that in the hydrodynamical model @xcite , the particle emission time scales with the radius of the droplet .",
    "particles will be emitted earlier if the radius of the droplet is smaller , as in a source of many droplets .",
    "an earlier emission time will lead to a smaller extracted hbt radius @xmath0 . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath0 can be close to @xmath1 for a granular quark - gluon plasma source @xcite .",
    "previously , pratt @xmath2 studied the hbt interferometry of granular droplets by averaging over many events @xcite .",
    "methods to detect a granular structure by the single - event intensity interferometry were recently proposed @xcite .",
    "it was found that the single - event correlation function from a chaotic source of granular droplets exhibits large fluctuations , with maxima and minima at relative momenta which depend on the relative coordinates of the droplet centers .",
    "the presence of this type of maxima and minima of a single - event correlation function at many relative momenta is a signature for a granular structure and a first - order qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of using the single - event two - pion interferometry at rhic arises because of the small number of pion pairs with small relative momenta . in a typical single event of a nearly head - on collision at very high energies at rhic ,",
    "the number of identical pions is of the order of a few thousand .",
    "the number of observed identical pions @xmath3 is only a small fraction of this number .",
    "for example , the number of identical pions detected in the star collaboration in the most central au - au collisions at rhic is of the order of a few hundred @xcite .",
    "although the number of pairs of identical pions in the event varies as @xmath4 , only a small fraction of these pairs have relative momentum small enough to be useful in a hbt analysis .",
    "the number of pion pairs in each relative momentum bin may be so small that there can be large associated statistical errors .    instead of trying to obtain the detailed granular structure of the emitting source in each event at present",
    ", it will be useful in the initial stage to have a more modest goal .",
    "it is desirable to see whether the correlation functions indicate possible signals for a granular structure .",
    "more refined study of the granular structure can follow after the initial stage becomes successful .",
    "accordingly , we shall try to outline a method to extract the signals for the granular structure .",
    "our idea is to calculate the fluctuations of the single - event correlation function relative to its corresponding mixed - event correlation function .",
    "the difference constitutes the `` signal '' for the event in question .",
    "the distribution of these fluctuations ( in units of their statistical errors ) , collected for a large number of single - events to enhance statistics , would have a wider distribution for a granular structure , compared to those from emitting source without the granular structure .",
    "the distribution of the correlation function fluctuations provide a useful tool to detect the granular structure of the source . in particular , the root - mean - square fluctuation , in the case of a granular droplet structure ,",
    "increases when the number of droplets decreases .",
    "if the phase transition is accompanied by only a few number of droplets , the signal may be large enough to make it detectable . in what follows",
    ", we would like to analyze whether this method may be feasible .",
    "the correlation function @xmath19 is in general a function of the 4-dimensional momentum @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "previous results of the single - event correlation function of granular droplets indicate large fluctuations as a function of the relative 4-momentum @xmath20 , having maxima and minima at locations which depend on the relative coordinates of the droplet centers @xcite . to map out the details of such a multi - dimensional correlation function",
    ", it is necessary to have a large number of pion pairs in a single event which may be beyond the capabilities of present detectors and accelerators . with limited statistics as would likely be the case , we can first study the simplifying case by concentrating on a small number of degree of freedom and integrating out other degrees of freedom so that the statistical errors in the correlation function can be smaller . for this purpose , we shall study the correlation function as a function of the variable @xmath22 for which the other degrees of freedom have been integrated out .    in our numerical work for a granular source with @xmath23 droplets ,",
    "we obtain the single - event and mixed - event two - pion correlation functions for the granular source with the following steps :    step 1 : generate the space - time coordinates @xmath24 of the droplet centers according to a distribution of the droplet centers .",
    "step 2 : select the two emitting - pions from the droplets randomly , and get the space - time coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the pions in the laboratory frame according to the density distribution of the droplets , the coordinates of the droplet centers , and the collective velocities at the emission points @xmath27 .",

    "step 4 : accumulate the event in the bin of the corresponding relative momentum variable @xmath22 with the weight factor @xmath32 for the probability @xmath33 for a pair of uncorrelated pions of relative momentum @xmath34 , and with the weight factor @xmath35 for the probability @xmath8 for a pair of correlated pions of relative momentum @xmath34 , @xmath36[e'_2/e_2 ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy of the @xmath39th pion in the frame in which the source element at @xmath40 is at rest , which is obtained from @xmath41 by a reverse lorentz transformation with the collective velocity @xmath42 .",
    "step 5 : repeat steps 2 through 4 for @xmath43 pairs of pions in a single event .",
    "we label the distributions obtained for @xmath33 for a pair of uncorrelated pions by @xmath44 and the distribution of @xmath8 for a pair of correlated pions by @xmath45 .",
    "step 6 : repeat steps 1 through 5 for @xmath46 number of different events , and obtain the mixed - event correlated and uncorrelated pion - pair distributions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , by summing @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the @xmath46 different events .",
    "step 7 : obtain the single - event correlation function @xmath51 by dividing @xmath49 by @xmath52 and the mixed - event correlation function @xmath53 by dividing @xmath47 by @xmath52 .",
