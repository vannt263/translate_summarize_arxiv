    "since the spectrum of @xmath734 is nonnegative , @xmath754 is well defined and belongs to @xmath734 .",

    "stability of scalar field as an indicator of gravitational stability _",
    "the stability of a scalar test field on a given spacetime is oftentimes taken as indicative of linear gravitational stability .",
    "sads@xmath3 offers an example of how naive this idea can be : although there is a single choice of boundary condition for a scalar field on sads@xmath3 , under which the field is stable , there are infinitely many possible dynamics for gravitational perturbations , and they give quite different results . if any mixture of dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions with @xmath69 below the critical value is chosen for the different modes , the evolution of gravitational perturbations will be stable . if , on the contrary , a robin boundary condition with @xmath69 above the critical value is allowed _ for a single _ @xmath174 , the perturbation will be unstable , the instability being signaled by an exponentially growing mode similar to ( [ huns ] ) .",

    "we have found that in all cases the potentials @xmath370 in equation ( [ hlm2 ] ) fit into the type 1 / type 2 classification introduced in section [ robins ] , equations ( [ vc ] ) and ( [ v1 ] ) , as shown in table [ t1 ] . in dimension four",
    "the potentials are type 1 ( not diverging at @xmath26 ) , this implies that the functional space of solutions of ( [ dd22])-([hlm2 ] ) are functions @xmath121 for which both @xmath121 and @xmath504 are defined at the conformal boundary at @xmath26 and on which we can impose , dirichlet ( @xmath548 ) , neumann ( @xmath772 ) or robin ( @xmath773 ) conditions at the boundary .",
    "naturalness of robin boundary conditions _",
    "robin boundary conditions on the 1 + 1 auxiliary fields ( [ dd22])-([hlm2 ] ) are a natural choice , as they result from the imposition of dirichlet or neumann conditions on more relevant fields , as discussed in section [ natural ] .",
    "this condition also arises in the context of ads - cft dualities , and if we want to preserve the even / odd supersymmetric like duality in sads@xmath3 ( see below ) .",
    "+    _ 4 . robin instabilities _    for type 1 potentials there are instabilities for high enough robin parameter @xmath69 . if the potential is nonnegative , there is a critical value @xmath444 such that the set of unstable boundary conditions is @xmath446 .",
    "we prove a number of properties about the energy spectrum and the form of the unstable modes .",
    "the mechanism triggering instabilities is explained with the simple toy models of section [ toy ] .",
    "although for any positive @xmath69 energy is pumped into the system from the conformal boundary , we show that this is not enough to trigger instabilities , as @xmath567 is strictly positive in type 1 positive potentials , and so there are stable cases with @xmath774 .",

    "this was used to extend to the even sector the proof of nonmodal stability for schwarzschild black holes when @xmath11 . in the asymptotically ads case , however , the even / odd duality is compromised by the need of mapping boundary conditions preserved by the dynamics .",
    "we have found that there are only two boundary conditions compatible with the even / odd symmetry ( dirichlet in one sector and robin with a particular @xmath69 in the other one ) , and only one of them leads to a stable dynamics .",
