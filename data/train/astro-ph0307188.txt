    "of the 271 point sources of high - energy gamma - rays detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( _ egret _ ) on the compton gamma ray observatory spacecraft , most remain unidentified  @xcite .",
    "the nature of these sources is one of the biggest questions raised by the _ egret _  mission .",
    "certainly some of them will turn out to belong to the established classes of sources : active galactic nuclei ( agn )  @xcite and pulsars  @xcite .",
    "a few , as well , may be discovered to be artifacts of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "however there are more unidentified sources than expected from these populations  @xcite .",
    "the large error regions for the _ egret _  sources often make it difficult to discern which of several candidates is the true counterpart in another wavelength .    when studying the unidentified sources , there are several observables which one might use to determine their nature .",
    "one can look at the spatial distribution  @xcite to estimate what fraction of the population is galactic in nature , and what scale height the galactic fraction has .",
    "one can look at positional correlations with other object types and galactic structures  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum is another characteristic which can be used to classify sources as `` pulsar - like '' , `` agn - like '' , or `` other ''  @xcite .    in this same vein",
    ", one can examine the _ egret _  catalog sources for evidence of time variability , in hopes of distinguishing the various source classes .",
    "the known pulsars are seen to have a fairly constant flux ( @xmath0 when averaged over many pulse periods , consistent with the systematic uncertainties in _ egret _  flux measurements ) , as is expected from the nature of their energy production .",
    "many agn are seen to flare dramatically , which makes their identification easier .",
    "but , as with many aspects of the _ egret _  data , it is difficult to characterize the time variability of most sources , because of the limited statistics and the non - continuous observations .",
    "thus it is natural to look for a statistic which will measure the variability in a rigorous way .",
    "this work is based on the dissertation of @xcite .",
    "changes in the details of the method have caused changes in the numerical results , but the conclusions are not altered .    in  [ prev_meth ]",
    "we briefly review the previous methods which have been used for evaluating the variability of _ egret _  point sources . in  [ ourway ]",
    "we outline an improved method . in  [ anal_section ] we describe how this method was applied to the _ egret _  data .",
    "the results are described in  [ variresults ] and summarized briefly in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "all previous analyses of the variability of _ egret _  sources have used the flux values published in the second @xcite or third _ egret _   catalog @xcite , hereafter called 2eg and 3eg .",
    "this introduces the problem of upper limits .",
    "many of the individual observations produced no positive detections .",
    "for these observations , the flux is reported as a 95% confidence upper limit produced by like , the standard _ egret _  likelihood program @xcite .",
    "the first comprehensive method used for estimating the variability of _ egret _  sources is the one introduced by @xcite .",
    "this method finds the @xmath1 of the measured source intensities in 2eg , assuming a constant flux , and uses @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tail probability of obtaining such a large @xmath1 .",
    "there are two problems with this method : one statistical , and one conceptual .",
    "the statistical problem is introduced when using upper limits : @xcite use zero as the flux estimate when the measured flux estimate would be negative , and for the error they use the like  upper limits .",
    "thus their resulting `` @xmath1 '' will not have a @xmath1 distribution .",
    "since the like  results are statistically conservative , this means that sources with upper limits included in the analysis will have a lower @xmath4 than they should .",
    "the conceptual problem with the @xmath4 method is the use of a @xmath1 statistic to determine variability . the @xmath3 statistic is the p - value for the hypothesis of constant source flux",
    "thus , sources with a large @xmath4 are inconsistent with being constant .",
    "but we do not know whether such a source has a large @xmath4 because of large intensity fluctuations , or because of small error bars on the intensity measurements .",
    "similarly , a source with a small @xmath4 might truly be constant , or it might just have very poor measurements of its flux .",
    "@xcite also applied this method to two - day segments of _ egret _  data , looking for rapid variation that would not have been discovered by examining full viewing periods .",
    "they were severly limited by large statistical uncertainties , but they found previously - undiscovered variation in several sources .",
    "@xcite describe a statistic called the @xmath5 index .",
    "@xmath5 is a normalized ratio of the standard deviation to the average flux .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the approach we describe below .",
    "it is a step toward dealing with the conceptual problem described above , but it introduces another ad - hoc approach to dealing with upper limits .",
    "also there is no estimate of confidence intervals for @xmath5 values .",
    "other , less quantitative criteria have been used to produce lists of sources which are not highly variable .",
    "these lists are heterogeneous collections of sources with rather different properties .",
    "in addition to truly non - variable sources , they tend to include bright variable sources . they exclude mainly the sources which flared once or twice and were otherwise undetectable .",
    "for instance , @xcite defined a class of 88 _ persistent _ unidentified sources .",
    "these are the ones which are significantly detected ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 , depending on position ) in the cumulative data up to 1995 october .",
    "@xcite produced a similar list of 120 _ steady _ , unidentified sources .",
    "they required that the flux in the cumulative data must be either a more significant detection than any individual observation or within @xmath8 of the largest individual flux .",
    "again the effects of average brightness and variability are hard to disentangle .",
    "it is difficult to compare sources or populations on the basis of these lists because they provide only a binary variable / nonvariable classification .",
    "we propose to answer two questions about the variability of a source : how much does the flux vary and how precisely do we know this ? to do this we define @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the average and standard deviation , respectively , of the true flux of the source . this fractional variability is much closer to what we really want to know about a source .",
    "there could also be other statistics which might be more meaningful for flaring sources , such as the peak flare flux divided by the quiescent level .",
    "since the flux measurements have uncertainties , we must find a way to estimate @xmath12 from the data .",
    "unfortunately this ca nt be done in a completely model - independent way .",
    "we ignore the ordering and spacing of the individual flux measurements .",
    "we assume only that all flux values of a particular source are random values drawn from the same probability distribution .",
    "this approach elminates all consideration of long timescale correlations in the data .",
    "the probability distribution is parameterized by @xmath12 .",
    "such a model is necessary in order to disentangle the effects of real flux variation from statistical fluctuations .",
    "an infinite number of source flux distributions exist which will yield the same @xmath12 ; we want to pick one that is compatible with our notions of what the true source flux distribution should be , but which is also fairly general .",
    "the first source flux distribution one might try is a gaussian .",
    "thus , we would find the likelihood of obtaining our data given that the true flux @xmath13 was drawn from a gaussian with mean @xmath10 and standard deviation @xmath14 .",
    "we could then find the maximum likelihood value of @xmath12 , together with a confidence interval for @xmath12 defined in the standard way @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could follow the bayesian procedure : form priors for the distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath12 , and find an estimate of @xmath12 , together with an error region , by marginalizing over @xmath10 .",
    "the use of the gaussian distribution for source fluxes has a flaw , however .",
    "it allows the possibility of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , as well as the unphysical possibility of negative @xmath10 .    instead of a gaussian",
    ", we choose to use the gamma distribution ; that is , the flux @xmath13 is drawn from the differential probability distribution @xmath17 where the adjustable parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the shape and scaling of the function , respectively .",
    "the parameters can be related to the desired quantities by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "this distribution function has a peak if @xmath23 . for @xmath24",
    ", it decreases monotonically from @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior is a good match for the different types of observed variations .",
    "some sources are steady ( large @xmath26 ) , while many others are mostly faint with occasional flares ( small @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xcite did the same analysis described below using a lognormal distribution .",
    "there is an excellent correlation between the results , but the gamma distribution produced fewer numerical difficulties , such as lack of convergence .",
    "we take this as a validation of our choice of probability distribution .",
    "it is standard in _ egret _  analysis to calculate the likelihood of the observed data for a certain source flux @xcite . typically , the values output by an analysis program are the most likely flux and a confidence interval . in the case of upper limits ,",
    "the most likely flux is taken as zero , and the confidence interval might be defined in one of several ways @xcite .    for this work , we would like to be able to calculate the likelihood for any source flux , not necessarily one near the maximum likelihood value .",
    "thus it is useful to look for a parameterized family of curves which will closely fit the full likelihood function .",
    "the results of the many individual measurements can be stored in a compact form and reproduced quickly as needed .    after examining many such curves , we found a simple function which fulfills our requirements .",
    "we choose @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are adjustable parameters and only @xmath31 is allowed .",
    "a likelihood function need not be normalized . if @xmath32 , @xmath33 has a peak at @xmath34 of width @xmath35 , and the _ egret _  test statistic @xcite @xmath36 . if @xmath37 , @xmath33 has its maximum at @xmath25 .",
    "this function was originally derived by analogy with the poisson probability function .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 plays the role of an effective number of detected photons , while @xmath38 is the exposure and the offset @xmath29 accounts for the effects of diffuse emission and nearby point sources .",
    "@xmath39 would become singular if @xmath40 , but this never occurred in our analysis .",
    "this form fits the observed likelihood functions rather well ( figure  [ intcurvefig ] ) , both in cases of large source flux and in upper limit situations .      with the parameterized distribution of source fluxes from the preceding section , we can use bayes s theorem to write the likelihood of observing a given viewing period s worth of data ( @xmath41 ) from a source with a certain @xmath10 and @xmath12 : @xmath42 where the second term in equation  ( [ tauonevp ] ) is the gamma distribution written in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "the likelihood of a sequence of observations ( @xmath43 ) will then be @xmath44 or @xmath45      we have assumed that the source flux during all the measurements was drawn independently from the same distribution . this can be problematic if the measurements last for varying lengths of time .",
    "for example , in the _ egret _  data , there are frequently several successive viewing periods of a few days duration , pointing in nearly the same direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the normal mode of pointing in one direction for two weeks at a time .",
    "we do not want our results to depend on whether or not a two week viewing period was chopped into several bits .",
    "our solution is to combine successive measurements if they occur within 30 days , and treat them as one measurement . instead of the single - observation likelihood in equation  ( [ intcurvefit ] )",
    ", we use a composite @xmath39 which is the product of the individual terms .",
    "the generalization of equation  ( [ tauonevp ] ) is obvious .",
    "these combined measurements are reflected in the number of observations reported in table  1 .",
    "thus this analysis is sensitive to variations with a time scale of a month or more",
    ". we will not be able to detect the 1 - 2 day flares found by @xcite from several _ egret _  sources .",
    "the first step in this analysis was the re - analysis of the 3eg catalog with a modified likelihood program which produces a likelihood function in the form of equation  ( [ intcurvefit ] ) @xcite . for each viewing period ,",
    "any of the 271 sources from 3eg catalog which were within the instrument s field of view were included in the source list .",
    "in addition , any of the 145 marginal sources ( which were used in the original analysis of the catalog but were not significant enough to merit inclusion in the official list ) which were in the field of view were added as well .",
    "the maximum likelihood set of source fluxes was then found .",
    "for each source , the parameters characterizing @xmath33 described in  [ intcurve ] were found .",
    "all source measurements were of flux ( @xmath46 ) , assuming a spectral index of @xmath47 , using all photons within @xmath48 of each source , and including all nearby sources ( both catalog and marginal ) in the model .",
    "we use only data taken with the full _ egret _  field of view , which includes everything through viewing period 429.0 ( ending 1995 september 27 ) except for four periods ( 403.0 , 403.5 , 411.1 , and 411.5 ) . with the smaller field of view",
    "used to take the rest of the data , we are not confident that the detector response functions are calibrated well enough for our purpose . also the number of point sources detected in each observation is reduced , so the remaining data are less useful .",
    "results are used only for the point sources within @xmath49 of the center of the field of view .",
    "this data selection is nearly the same as that used to produce the 3eg catalog .",
    "the likelihood of the sequence of observations as a function of @xmath12 was then calculated , as in  [ taucalc ] .",
    "all observations within one month of each other were lumped together , as per  [ timescales ] . from this likelihood ,",
    "the most likely values of @xmath12 were obtained , as well as confidence intervals .",
    "the mean flux @xmath10 can be marginalized away as a nuisance parameter after checking that its most likely value is consistent with the 3eg flux .      in the results reported below",
    ", several 3eg sources are omitted for various reasons .",
    "seven sources near the bright and pulsars are omitted because they are believed to be artifacts @xcite : , , , , , , and .",
    "the solar flare is omitted because it is clearly a unique occurrence .",
    "the sources and each had only one observation within 25  of the center of the field of view .",
    "thus the variability of these sources ca nt be evaluated .",
    "a cross - check of this analysis and the 3eg flux values turned up three sources with serious discrepancies : , , and .",
    "these three sources are omitted .",
    "the latter two are near very bright sources ( and ) , so we believe that our modified likelihood program may become confused in such areas .",
    "it is encouraging that only these three sources fail this test .",
    "the consistency of results for all the others encourages us that the modified likelihood program is valid in the other cases .",
    "this analysis has two main sources of systematic error .",
    "the first is from the instrument itself .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ egret _  instrument is variable @xcite . despite efforts to measure and compensate for long term drifts , there is a residual variability of about 1011% @xcite . in an effort to minimize this systematic error ,",
    "only source observations within 25  of the instrument axis were used in the analysis .",
    "it is conceivable that the variation in measured fluxes might be reduced by using the `` noisy '' measured sensitivity rather than the smoothed values that are usually employed in _ egret",
    "_  analysis .",
    "we tested this by calculating the fluxes of the three bright pulsars ( crab , geminga , vela ) by both methods . with the measured sensitivity values , vela appeared much more variable , the crab slighly more , and geminga slightly less .",
    "thus it appears to be appropriate to continue using the smoothed sensitivities .",
    "because of the systemitic variability , the galactic and isotropic background levels @xmath50 and @xmath51 were allowed to vary from viewing period to viewing period for a given source in the likelihood analysis .",
    "otherwise , a small change in a strong background could lead to a large change in a source flux .",
    "this procedure is standard practice for _ egret _  data analysis @xcite .",
    "the background levels were also allowed to float when @xmath33 was calculated .",
    "unfortunately , computational limitations precluded allowing nearby sources to vary during this calculation as well .",
    "thus , nearby sources were fixed at their maximum likelihood intensities ( calculated for that viewing period ) .",
    "this will lead to an underestimation of the error in flux , particularly for sources which have another source very close by .",
    "as both systematic effects will tend to exaggerate source variability , it is expected that even constant sources will show some small variability . to the extent that the systematics are dominated by the instrumental effects",
    ", the measured variability will be equal to the true variability added in quadrature to a constant systematic variability of about 10% .      although the most likely value of @xmath12 and its confidence interval provide a good description of a source s variability , there is considerable interest in the simpler question of whether a source is variable at all , independent of the question `` how much ? ''",
    "this is the goal of @xcite .",
    "this problem is complicated by the presence of the systematic errors . to help answer the question , we define the statistic @xmath52 .",
    "it represents the confidence with which we can reject the hypothesis @xmath53 , where 0.12 is a conservative estimate of the average systematic error .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 is the unconstrained maximum likelihood , @xmath57 is the maximum likelihood if @xmath12 is constrained to equal the systematic value 0.12 , and @xmath58 is the cumulative @xmath1 probability distribution with one degree of freedom",
    ". the use of the @xmath1 distribution can be justified by wilks s theorem @xcite when several independent likelihood functions are combined , even though they may not be gaussian functions individually .",
    "if the most likely @xmath12 is less than 0.12 , then there is no estimate for @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath52 values greater than 16 are shown as @xmath59 in table  1 . the p - value for rejecting the hypothesis that a source is non",
    "- variable is @xmath60 .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table  1 .",
    "the columns in the table give the names in the 3eg catalog , the most likely galactic longitudes and latitudes , the most likely values of @xmath12 , the 68% lower and upper confidence limits on @xmath12 , @xmath52 , the number of observations used in the analysis , possible associations with source classes , and specific identifications .      as can be seen from table  1 ,",
    "the limits on the variability of an individual source are usually not very strict . by grouping similar sources together",
    ", one can learn more about the average behavior of a class of sources .",
    "there are many sources which are found in multiple classes .",
    "many of the unidentified sources are found in densely - populated regions containing various types of young - population objects .",
    "the error boxes of the _ egret _  sources often contain several plausible counterparts .",
    "table  2 shows the results for the various source classes .",
    "it contains a description of each class , the number of sources in the class , the mean of @xmath12 , and an estimate of the intrinsic rms dispersion of @xmath12 in excess of the statistical errors .",
    "the last two quantities are calculated by assuming a gaussian distribution for @xmath12 and finding the likelihood as a function of mean and standard deviation by a method similar to that used in  [ method ] .",

    "apparently they succeeded , since the mean @xmath12 values ( 0.32 and 0.35 ) are fairly low .",
    "however , there are several examples of clearly variable sources in these lists .      with the variability of the source classes in hand ,",
    "it is possible to see which sources can be excluded from a source class based on the variability data .",
    "we begin by examining those sources which are inconsistent with being strongly variable : that is , the upper bound ( @xmath103 ) of the 68% region for @xmath12 is small .",
    "there are 8 sources for which this upper bound is less than 0.4 , significantly lower than the typical value for agn or unidentified sources .",
    "five of the six pulsars are in the list , with psr b1055@xmath10152 barely excluded .",
    "the possibility that others on the list might also be pulsars is intriguing .",
    "the sources are discussed individually below .",
    "the position of the pulsar , at the top of the list , is a bit surprising given its listing in @xcite as moderately variable .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first is the difference in the methods : @xcite report the confidence level with which the hypothesis of steady emission can be rejected . in their analysis ,",
    "the bright crab , geminga , and vela pulsars are all inconsistent with being constant at the 95% level due to systematic errors and the small statistical uncertainties .",
    "the second reason is the difference in data used : mclaughlin et  al .",
    "used all measurements up to to 30  from the instrument axis . in this analysis ,",
    "we have used only data out to 25 , because of the larger systematic errors at higher inclinations .",
    "is coincident with , a high @xmath104 pulsar .",
    "although pulsed emission was not seen in the first three years of _ egret _  data  @xcite , there has been a detection in more recent data @xcite .    is coincident with the bl lac , and is 1  from the position of , from which pulsed emission above 100 mev has been reported @xcite . in the 3eg catalog ,",
    "the pulsar was not detected as a separate source , and it is suggested that the flux between 100 mev and 1 gev is primarily from the pulsar , while the flux above 1 gev is mostly from 3c 66a @xcite .",
    "the flux measurements of this `` source '' will be dominated by the lower energy emission , hence the low variability .",
    "@xcite found a significant variation of this `` source '' on a 2-day timescale , likely from the agn . since our analysis uses only full observations , we ca nt confirm or reject this variation .",
    "the @xmath12 value of the vela pulsar is slightly higher than the 10% systematic variation .",
    "this is due to the presence of several artifact sources nearby @xcite . in a few viewing periods ,",
    "the measured flux of vela is low , and the flux from an artifact is quite high . because nearby source fluxes were not re - fit for each point on the likelihood - vs - intensity curve , such `` flux leaking '' can lead to an apparently high variability . by fixing the fluxes of the spurious sources one could lower vela s variability , but only if those nearby sources were not themselves variable .",
    "this was not done because of the unknown biases that could result .",
    "is unidentified , but its position is coincident with the supernova remnant , so it is thus an intriguing pulsar candidate .",
    "no pulsed signal has been detected from it , however , and the possibility exists that it is a radio - quiet pulsar @xcite .    ,",
    "another unidentified source , is the last member of this group .",
    "it is noteworthy that almost qualifies for this list .",
    "it is identified in the 3eg catalog as the bl lac object @xcite .",
    "the upper end of the 68% confidence region for @xmath12 is 0.38 , well below the typical agn variability of @xmath105 . in large part , this is because this source had no dramatic flares during any observations .",
    "in addition , the viewing periods with the highest and lowest fluxes were each combined with less extreme observations by the one - month averaging system (  [ method ] ,  [ timescales ] ) .",
    "a more sophisticated model might pick up longer or shorter term trends .      from table  1 ,",
    "18 sources have a 68% confidence region with a lower bound greater than 0.7 .",
    "these include 11 sources identified as agn .",
    "four of the unidentifed sources ( , , , and ) are at high galactic latitudes , and are generally believed to be agn  @xcite .",
    "the three remaining low latitude , unidentified sources are , , and . @xcite and @xcite propose a blazar identification for .",
    "@xcite discoverd the variability of 3eg j1837@xmath1010423 , but they reject a blazar identification .",
    "none of the seven unidentified sources is classified as steady or persistent .    because the @xmath4 statistic used by @xcite indicates how improbable it is that the observations come from a constant source , the use of the @xmath12 statistic in this way is nearly equivalent to the use of @xmath4 to find variable sources .",
    "indeed , when there is a close correspondence between 2eg and 3eg sources , sources with a high @xmath4 also have a high lower limit on @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to examine the behavior of the gamma sources near the galactic plane .",
    "there are many which show no sign of variability , but there are some variable sources which are distributed non - uniformly in galactic longitude .",
    "figure  [ longitude ] shows @xmath12 values for the 66 sources within 6  of the galactic plane . if we define a variable source as one with a most likely @xmath12 value @xmath106 or a minimum @xmath107 , then it can be seen that almost all of the 17 variable , low - latitude sources are clumped within @xmath108 of the galactic center .",
    "all 17 are unidentified .",
    "figure  [ deltahist ] shows histograms of the most likely @xmath12 values for all the sources within 6  of the galactic plane .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath12 distribution for the sources with @xmath109 , while the solid line shows the others .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite rejects the hypothesis that these two sets of values are drawn from the same population with a p - value of 5.1% .",
    "figure  [ longitude ] shows values of @xmath12 for these sources as a function of longitude .",
    "the filled circles show the most likely @xmath12 values and the ends of the bars show 68%  confidence lower limits ( @xmath110 in table  1 ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines are drawn at @xmath111 and @xmath112 to guide the eye .",
    "some of the apparent variation might be due to flux leakage between close companions , as with the vela pulsar (  [ lovsources ] ) . among the 17 variable sources there are three pairs and a triple within a few degrees .",
    "no pair of these sources has correlated fluxes with a correlation coefficient @xmath113 , except and .",
    "their correlation coefficient is @xmath114 , with a p - value of 2.4% .",
    "the variation of these two sources might be spurious , but the others seem to be on more solid ground .",
    "the distribution of variable sources is consistent with a young galactic population , as traced by molecular clouds @xcite , ob associations @xcite , snrs and hii regions @xcite , wr stars and of stars @xcite .",
    "the concentration in the inner radian and their latitude spread indicate typical distances of 58 kpc and luminosities @xmath115  100  mev , @xmath116  sr ) of ( 125 )  @xmath117 ( d/5  kpc)@xmath118 erg  s@xmath119 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the range found by @xcite for all the low - latitude sources in the 2eg catalog , both variable and non - variable .",
    "this luminosity range is typical of x - ray binaries and 10 kyr - old pulsars .",
    "the latter are expected to be steady emitters , but variable emission from pulsar wind nebulae is possible . in particular ,",
    "plerionic activity is more likely to explain the hard but variable 3eg  j1856 + 0114 source than pulsed emission from the 20 kyr - old pulsar or cosmic - ray emission in the surrounding w44 supernova shell .",
    "the same may be true for 3eg  j1420@xmath1016038 in the kookaburra nebula and 3eg  j1837@xmath1010423 near the g27.8 + 0.6 plerion .",
    "3eg  j1809@xmath1012328 also coincides with a pulsar wind nebula , but inverse - compton emission from electrons scattering the nebular synchrotron emission or the ambient radiation field from the nearby ob association fail to explain the source brightness @xcite .",
    "a 21 kyr - old pulsar , psr  j1826@xmath1011334 , found near the edge of the 3eg  j1826@xmath1011302 error box , could power the gamma - ray source .",
    "pulsars are also found near 3eg  j1308@xmath1016112 and 3eg  j1928 + 1733 , but they are much too weak to explain the sources",
    ".    variability over months is common in accreting systems .",
    "one high - mass x - ray binary , gx  304@xmath1011 , hosting a be star and a neutron star on an eccentric 132.5-day orbit , is found toward 3eg  j1308@xmath1016112 .",
    "it is known to exhibit strong long - term variability in x rays .",
    "electrons accelerated at the shock between the pulsar and stellar winds have been proposed to shine up to tev energies by upscattering the stellar radiation @xcite , but the 272  s pulsar in gx  304@xmath1011 is not likely to power a strong , energetic wind .",
    "3eg  j1736@xmath1012908 coincides with the x - ray source grs  1734@xmath101292 , which has been recently identified as a nearby seyfert 1 galaxy ( z = 0.0214 ) with radio jet emission and hard x - ray emission up to 400 kev @xcite .",
    "confirmation of variable emission above 100 mev from this galaxy would yield a first example of the activity of a seyfert jet at high energy and suggest a valuable target for tev telescopes .",
    "curiously , 11 of the 17 variable sources are in the `` steady '' category , and 10 are `` persistent . ''",
    "this happens because they are fairly bright .",
    "as long as they do nt vanish entirely for many observations , they still meet the selection criteria .",
    "the source nearest to the galactic center , , seems to be one of these variable sources .",
    "@xcite found only weak evidence that this source might be variable . with more data and a more sensitive method",
    ", the statistical evidence of its variability is fairly strong ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this would rule out any model in which this object is a cluster of neutron stars , a condensation of dark matter particles , or other non - compact object @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by @xcite , who show that the position of the _ egret _  source is not consistent with the galactic center .",
    "3eg j1746@xmath1012851 may be a field source like the other 16 low - latitude variables .",
    "the probablility of such a chance positional coincidence near the galactic center is about 2.7% .",
    "since the diffuse emission is most intense in the neighborhood of the galactic center , it is conceivable that errors in the background model or instrument psf will have their greatest effect there . to check this",
    "we correlated the flux of with the angle to the instrument pointing direction .",
    "the correlation coefficient is 0.46 , which has a p - value of 1.5% .",
    "if the maximum viewing angle is reduced from @xmath121 to @xmath122 , seven observations are eliminated .",
    "the flux - angle correlation is reduced to an insignificant level , but the estimate of @xmath12 becomes consistent with zero .    if there is a systematic problem at the galactic center , it should show up also in measurements of nearby sources .",
    "there are four other sources within @xmath123 of the center : , , , and .",
    "none of them shows such a large correlation of viewing angle and flux , and in one case the correlation is negative .",
    "however , 3eg  j1741@xmath1012321 and 3eg  j1744@xmath1013011 have a substantial negative flux correlation ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively ) with 3eg  j1746@xmath1012851 .",
    "this might be a sign of flux leakage , although 3eg  j1741@xmath1012312 is rather far away .    in view of these somewhat ambiguous signs of extra systematic errors",
    ", we must declare that the variability of is only a tentative conclusion .",
    "it is possible to characterize the flux variation of _ egret _  gamma - ray sources between viewing periods in a consistent way by using a simple model for the flux distribution and combining likelihood functions .",
    "this method produces useful results for almost all of the sources in the third _ egret_catalog , using both positive detections and upper limits in a uniform manner .",
    "the resulting table displays the average fractional variation @xmath12 and its confidence interval . for faint sources",
    "the confidence interval is necessarily large , allowing a wide range of possible behaviors .",
    "the identified rotation - powered pulsars all show a small variability , consistent with the estimated 10% systematic errors in the flux measurements . in general , identified blazars",
    "are highly variable , although there are a few exceptions .",
    "the unidentified sources show a range of behaviors .",
    "their average variability increases with galactic latitude , indicating that there are multiple populations .",
    "unidentified sources associated with pulsar with wind nebulae are , as a class , more variable than the ones associated with pulsars without nebulae . the highest - latitude unidentified sources have an average behavior similar to blazars .",
    "there is a population of 17 highly - variable sources along the galactic plane .",
    "these are concentrated in longitude within 1 radian of the galactic center .",
    "this is probably a high - luminosity population of sources in the inner spiral arms and molecular ring , while the remaining less - variable sources are closer and less luminous .",

    "<S> these functions can be combined in a uniform manner with a simple model of the flux distribution to characterize the flux variation by a confidence interval for the relative standard deviation of the flux . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is a table of these values for almost all the cataloged sources . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the identified pulsars are steady emitters and the blazars are mostly highly variable . </S>",
    "<S> the unidentified sources are heterogeneous , with greater variation at higher galactic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> there is an indication that pulsar wind nebulae are associated with variable sources . </S>",
    "<S> there is a population of variable sources along the galactic plane , concentrated in the inner spiral arms . </S>"
