    "the prima donna of all halo nuclei is @xmath0li : it offers an exciting experimental challenge but also questions the basic concepts of a large variety of structure theories .",
    "many experiments have been performed over the last decade , since the pioneering total reaction cross section experiment at berkeley @xcite .",
    "these include coulomb dissociation experiments @xcite , mass measurements @xcite , momentum distributions of the @xmath1li coming from the two neutron removal @xcite and of @xmath5li coming from the one neutron removal @xcite , proton inelastic scattering @xcite , as well as beta decay studies @xcite .",
    "we now know the system is bound by @xmath6 kev against three - body breakup @xcite with a momentum distribution around @xmath7 mev / c @xcite ( see _ addendum _ at the end of the paper ) .",
    "the ground state structure contains two valence neutrons in @xmath3 and @xmath4 configurations with approximately equal probability @xcite .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "matter radius of the system is @xmath8 fm @xcite .",
    "one can not understand the borromean nucleus @xmath0li without a good description of the @xmath9 subsystem @xmath5li .",
    "experimental programs are aware of this fact but , as this nucleus is particle unbound , it presents a further technical obstacle .",
    "the information on @xmath5li is summarized in @xcite .",
    "therein , it is possible to see the large number of experiments that have been performed to measure @xmath5li s spectrum , but also the contradictory energy , parity and spin assignments made .",
    "overall one can conclude the following : ( i ) the ground state of @xmath5li contains a valence neutron outside the @xmath10 subshell in a @xmath11 state , at approximately 50 kev or below ; ( ii ) there is a state around 0.4 mev that can be understood as a neutron single particle excitation into the @xmath12 orbital ; ( iii ) there is no clear evidence for a d - state below 3 mev .",
    "in the early days , three - body models of two neutrons and an inert @xmath1li core were developed to describe properties of @xmath0li @xcite . at that time nothing",
    "was known about @xmath5li , and theorists could play the game of adjusting freely the @xmath13li interaction in order to produce a sensible @xmath0li ground state @xcite .",
    "models produced states where the two neutrons were in @xmath14 and in @xmath15 states coupled to the ground state of the core @xmath1li . the relative strength of these two components varied significantly depending on the @xmath9 effective interaction . in @xcite",
    "a three - body force was introduced in addition to the two - body @xmath16 and @xmath9 interactions . in @xcite",
    "a density dependent @xmath16 delta force was used and emphasis was given to the importance of pairing .",
    "three - body inert core models have been expanded to generate three - body continuum states @xcite and the complexity of these three - body scattering states was analyzed within the context of proton inelastic scattering .",
    "microscopic calculations in the early nineties were unable to reproduce a realistic binding energy for @xmath0li without artificially renormalizing the interactions , namely forcing the @xmath12 orbital to be closer to the continuum threshold ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as pairing effects had been identified to be crucial @xcite , by introducing a phenomenological force in the pairing channel , a self consistent description of the li isotopic chain became possible within the relativistic hartree - bogolyubov framework ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "effective interactions valid near the driplines have meanwhile been developed in shell model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , configuration mixing , required to produce a realistic ground state for @xmath0li , is still introduced by hand .",
    "it is only recently that ab - initio methods have reached mass a=11 @xcite .",
    "although the general spectra look promising , there is a clear limitation on the accuracy of the energy ( and consequently of the two neutron separation energy ) and much more effort is necessary to obtain reliable spectroscopic information .",
    "there are still some open questions regarding @xmath0li , even when considering the ground state only .",
    "should the quadrupole deformation of @xmath1li play a role in the structure of @xmath0li ? assuming the low lying states of @xmath5li are mostly neutron single particle excitations ,",
    "then we should find a d - wave around 2 mev excitation energy , as in the case of @xmath0be .",
    "even if experiment has been inconclusive in this respect , if such a state were to exist , what would be the implications for the ground state of @xmath0li ? would one expect to also have a strong @xmath17 configuration in the ground state of @xmath0li as in the ground state of @xmath18be ?    on the issue of core deformation and/or excitation",
    ", @xmath0li is considered within the nilsson model @xcite .",
    "the core @xmath1li has an uncoupled proton that can be either in a @xmath19 or @xmath20 orbital . in that simple picture , the extra two neutrons in @xmath0li ,",
    "occupy a different k - orbit and would not be strongly affected by the orientation of the deformed axis .",
    "in addition , a shell model calculation using two independent frequencies ( one for the core , the other for the halo neutrons ) @xcite shows that core polarization due to the halo neutrons is very small .",
    "the three - body model with core excitation @xcite allows us to address these issues keeping all the three - body dynamics .",
    "this model was applied to the be isotopes @xmath0be and @xmath18be .",
    "the coupled channel description of the states in @xmath0be was produced assuming a @xmath5be+n structure where the @xmath21 excited state of @xmath5be was explicitly included in the model space .",
    "a rotational model was used for the core but the strength of the coupling between the two @xmath5be states was taken from the measured @xmath22 value .",
    "an effective @xmath23 interaction for @xmath0be could be made to reproduce the parity inversion of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bound states , the spectroscopy of these states , as well as the d - wave resonance .",
    "based on such a realistic description of the @xmath5be+n subsystem @xcite three - body calculations were performed using hyper - spherical coordinates and a hyper - spherical harmonic basis @xcite . in this formulation , the faddeev equations reduce to a set of hyper - radial coupled channel equations .",
    "antisymmetrization was taken into account in an approximate way by projecting out the lowest @xmath5be+n states with large overlap with the occupied @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "our model was able to predict most features of the @xmath18be system @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ground state was predicted to contain roughly one third of core excitation with neutrons in the @xmath17 .",
    "if only the neutrons play a role in the low lying spectra of @xmath5li and @xmath0li , one expects similarities between the spectra of these nuclei and those of @xmath0be and @xmath18be .",
    "it is then reasonable to think of @xmath5li as @xmath28li+n and of @xmath0li as @xmath28li+n+n .",
    "the main difference between the three - body model of @xmath28li+n+n and that of @xmath5be+n+n is the spin of the ground state of the core .",
    "exactly for this reason , computational needs for @xmath0li are much larger than for @xmath18be . also , the first excited state of @xmath5be ( @xmath21 ) couples the valence neutrons to new orbitals whereas the ground state of @xmath1li @xmath29 enables a larger variety of orbitals than its excited state @xmath25 .",
    "note that , in @xmath1li , there are reorientation couplings just for the ground state , which are not present in @xmath5be .",
    "are these differences important when modelling @xmath0li ?",
    "now that computational power is very much increased , it is timely to revisit the problem under the constraints provided by all the new @xmath5li data .",
    "the hamiltonian in the three - body model with core excitation can be written as : @xmath30 where the coordinates are represented in fig .",
    "[ coord ] and @xmath31 is an internal degree of freedom of the core .",
    "these coordinates are transformed into the hyper - spherical coordinates and through an appropriate expansion of the wavefunction , the three - body schrdinger equation is reduced to a set of coupled channel equations dependent on hyper - radius @xmath32 and hyper - momentum @xmath33 .",
    "the truncation of the basis is done through the quantum number @xmath33 .",
    "other details of the calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    ".[be11 ] low lying spectrum of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "excitation energies in mev .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the ground state of @xmath0li , shell model predicts 15% d - wave .",
    "this @xmath34% d - component in @xmath0li comes mainly from the low lying d - waves present in the @xmath5li spectrum .    also relevant for",
    "the discussion is the overlap @xmath35li@xmath36li ( g.s)@xmath37 which is predicted to be very strong and nearly exhausts all the spectroscopic strength .",
    "this is a clear indication that the first excited state of @xmath1li is not important in the description of the ground state of @xmath0li .",
    "it is important to understand the implications of the @xmath5li structure on @xmath0li .",
    "albeit the large number of experiments , a close study of @xcite raises questions about the precision with which states in @xmath5li are known .",
    "we have explored the possibility of different assumptions for the states to which we fit the @xmath9 interaction , namely @xmath38 at @xmath39 kev ; @xmath40 at @xmath41 kev and @xmath42 at @xmath43 mev . of these ,",
    "the least uncertain is the @xmath5li ground state .",
    "we have checked that the main features of the present work are not changed by moving the p - wave to @xmath44 kev .",
    "more important is the uncertainty in the location of the d - resonance .",
    "there is no clear experimental evidence for a d - wave at @xmath43 mev , or at any lower energy .",
    "if it is a broad resonance , or it is superposed by other states belonging to the doublets , it could be much harder to observe experimentally .",
    "the width of the d - wave resonance increases rapidly with energy .",
    "if a @xmath5li d - state were at @xmath45 mev as in @xmath0be , the width would be @xmath46 kev .",
    "the @xmath5li @xmath47 mev predicted by shell model has @xmath48 kev and if it were shifted to @xmath49 mev as in the three - body model , the width would become @xmath50 mev .",
    "such a broad state would be very hard to measure .",
    "as seen above , shell model predicts a @xmath51 d - wave state at around 2 mev .",
    "what happens in the three - body model if the d - wave is pushed down ?",
    "we refitted the @xmath9 interaction with @xmath52 , fixing the centroid of the d - resonance at @xmath53 mev .",
    "the quadruplet states ( @xmath54 ) move from ( 2.67 ; 3.50 ; 4.22 ; 3.21 ) to ( 1.79 ; 2.53 ; 3.32 ; 2.36 ) ( mev ) , respectively .",
    "an immediate consequence is the additional binding in the @xmath0li system ( @xmath55 kev ) .",
    "however this extra d - wave attraction is not sufficient to change the structure of @xmath0li s ground state , which remains essentially @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath17 only up to @xmath56% .",
    "we perform three - body calculations for @xmath0li including deformation and excitation of @xmath1li .",
    "we find that reorientation effects of the core can account for the known configuration admixture of s - waves and p - waves in the ground state of @xmath0li . with a simple rotational model for the core , it is possible to obtain an effective interaction for @xmath13li , fitted to the properties of @xmath5li , that produces the two neutron binding energy , the r.m.s matter radius , the charged radius , and the structure of @xmath0li all consistent with experiment .",
    "core excitation in the ground state of this three - body system is found to be unimportant .",
    "this result is confirmed by shell model calculations . finally the d - wave strength is predicted to be very small ( @xmath57% ) in the three - body model .",
    "this is in disagreement with shell model predictions that show roughly @xmath58% , @xmath59% , @xmath60% for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath61 components .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy comes from the corresponding states in the subsystem @xmath5li .",
    "so far , experiments have not been able to make a clear statement about d - states in @xmath5li . in our @xmath9 effective interaction",
    "we have assumed that such states would be above 3 mev .",
    "however , shell model produces d - states that are at much lower energy ( around 2 mev ) , similar to @xmath0be .",
    "resolving experimentally the d - states in @xmath5li will settle once and for all the structure of the ground state of @xmath0li .",
    "this experiment should be done with a reaction starting from @xmath1li rather than knock - out from @xmath0li since there is not much d - wave in @xmath0li to start with .",
    "one possibility would be to repeat the @xmath1li(d , p)@xmath5li @xcite with higher beam energy .",
    "after the completion of this work we learned about the recent high precision mass measurement of @xmath0li : @xmath62 kev @xcite . even though the experimental accuracy is now well beyond the accuracy of the three body model , this additional binding may be an indication that the d - wave is below @xmath63 mev .",
