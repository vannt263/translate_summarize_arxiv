    "surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the digitized palomar sky survey @xcite have revealed large samples of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) out to @xmath9 .",
    "studies by @xcite have shown that at such a high redshift we are approaching the epoch of reionization , the edge of the `` dark ages '' , when the first stars and massive black holes were formed .",
    "eddington - limit arguments suggest that the supermassive black holes at the center of these qsos are on the order of @xmath10 .",
    "if the correlation between bulge and black - hole masses @xcite also holds at these high redshifts , then these sources have associated spheroids with masses on the order of @xmath11 .",
    "it is challenging to explain the formation of such massive structures on relatively short timescales ( @xmath12  1  gyr ) .",
    "however , @xcite estimate that almost one third of known quasars at @xmath13 ought to be lensed by galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "if these quasars are indeed gravitationally lensed , the estimated masses of their associated spheroids could be smaller by up to an order of magnitude ; this would allow a less efficient assembly process .",
    "high resolution radio observations of high - redshift radio - loud quasars can be used to test for strong gravitational lensing by looking for multiple imaging on scales from tens of milliarcseconds ( mas ) to arcseconds .",
    "also , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of core - jet radio sources in quasars over a large range in redshift have been used to constrain the cosmic geometry , under the assumption that such sources are ( roughly ) standard rulers @xcite . in general",
    ", the high resolution of the vlbi observations permits a more detailed look at the physical structures in the most distant cosmic sources .    to date , only three radio loud quasars at @xmath14 have been imaged at mas resolution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of three more quasars at @xmath15 : sdssp j105320.42@xmath1001649.7 at @xmath2 , sdssp j123503.04@xmath1000331.7 at @xmath3 , and sdssp j091316.56@xmath4591921.5 at @xmath5 ( hereafter j1053@xmath10016 , j1235@xmath10003 , and j0913@xmath45919 ) .",
    "j1053@xmath10016 was first identified by @xcite and @xcite as bri 1050@xmath10000 , while the other two sources were discovered in the five - color imaging data from the sdss @xcite .",
    "all three quasars are known to be radio - loud @xcite    throughout this paper , we assume a flat cosmological model with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  km  s@xmath19  mpc@xmath19 . in this model , 1",
    "mas corresponds to about 7  pc at @xmath20 .",
    "the observations were carried out at 1425  mhz using the ten stations of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the nrao .",
    "the sources j0913@xmath45919 , j1235@xmath10003 , and j1053@xmath10016 , were observed on the 1st , 21st , and 29th of march 2003 , respectively .",
    "the total observing time on each source was 7  hr .",
    "the observations employed nodding - style phase referencing with a cycle time of 3.5  minutes .",
    "the phase calibrators of j1053@xmath10016 , j1235@xmath10003 , and j0913@xmath45919 , were j1048@xmath40055 , j1232@xmath10224 , and j0921@xmath46215 , respectively .",
    "phase - referencing observations allow the determination of the absolute position of the target source and its components , if any , from the position of the calibrator @xcite . in applying the phase - referencing technique ,",
    "the accuracy of the calibrator position is important .",
    "the positions of our phase - reference sources are obtained from the vlba calibrator survey @xcite , and are accurate to about 1  mas .    two adjacent 8  mhz baseband",
    "channel pairs were used in the observations of each source , both with right and left - hand circular polarizations , sampled at two bits .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro , nm , with 2  s correlator integration time .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "after applying _ a priori _ flagging , amplitude calibration was performed using measurements of the antenna gain and the system temperature of each station .",
    "ionospheric corrections were applied using the aips task `` tecor '' .",
    "the phase calibrators were self - calibrated in both phase and amplitude , and imaged in an iterative cycle .",
    "the self - calibration solutions of the phase calibrators were applied to the respective target sources . to further improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the images , we self calibrated the target sources themselves .",
    "figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , are the vlba images of j1053@xmath10016 , j1235@xmath10003 , and j0913@xmath45919 , respectively .",
    "the rms noise in each image is 68.5 , 67 , and 66  @xmath21jy  beam@xmath19 , with dynamic ranges of 180 , 252 , and 293 , respectively .",
    "all these sources are unresolved at the angular resolution of the vlba at the observed 1.4  ghz frequency , suggesting that the radio emission from each object is confined to a compact region less than 10  mas in size .",
    "table 1 shows the results of fitting gaussian models to the observed source spatial profiles using the aips task `` jmfit '' .",
    "the source names , redshifts , and positions are listed in columns 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "their total flux densities are listed in column 5 , and the derived upper limits to deconvolved source sizes are given in column 6 .",
    "the vla flux densities of these objects at 1.4 , 5 , and 15 ghz , are listed in table  2 ( stern et al.2000 ; carilli et al .  2001 ; petric et al .  2003 ; m. p. rupen 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "in all cases , the 1.4 ghz flux densities measured by the vla and vlba are equal to better than @xmath22 .",
    "these results imply that the sources are not highly variable on time scales of years .",
    "two of these objects , namely j1053@xmath10016 and j1235@xmath10003 , have flat spectra between 1.4 and 5  ghz , but have steeper spectra between 5 and 15  ghz .",
    "the source j0913@xmath45919 is a steep spectrum compact source between 1.4 and 5  ghz .",
    "note that an observing frequency of 1.4 ghz corresponds to a rest frequency of about 8 ghz at @xmath20 .",
    "we have synthesized larger images ( @xmath23 ) using the vlba and found no other radio components at @xmath24 level ( @xmath25jy  beam@xmath19 ) in the field .",
    "the implied dynamic range limit between the target sources themselves and any companion structures is then larger than 60 to 100 .",
    "a similar limit to extended and/or multiple structures has been found on larger scales ( @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) for all these three sources using the vla @xcite .",
    "the vlba imaging of three @xmath15 radio loud quasars ( j1053@xmath10016 , j1235@xmath10003 , and j0913@xmath45919 ) shows that these sources are smaller than a few mas in size , corresponding to physical scales of @xmath28 pc . on the other hand ,",
    "all three sources show falling spectra at high frequency , and none of the sources are variable on yearly timescales .",
    "these results suggests that the sources are likely core - jet radio sources , and hence may be used to extend to very high redshifts the studies of cosmic geometry using core - jet radio sources ( gurvits et al .",
    "higher frequency vlba observations at higher spatial resolution are planned to test this possibility .",
    "we find no indication of multiple radio components in the fields of these sources on scales of 20 mas to a few arcseconds , to dynamic range limits of @xmath8 .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for three other @xmath6 radio loud quasars @xcite .",
    "these results imply that at least these six high @xmath29 quasars are not strongly gravitationally lensed .",
    "the compact nature of these quasars make them excellent candidates for future h  i 21  cm absorption experiments to detect the neutral igm in their host galaxies @xcite , in particular the steep spectrum source j0913@xmath45919 .",
    "such a search is currently under - way using the giant meter wave radio telescope .",
    "knowledge of source structure , as presented herein , is critical for both identifying potential candidates for h  i 21  cm absorption searches , and for subsequent interpretation of the results .",
    "the authors thank g. b. taylor for useful discussions . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
