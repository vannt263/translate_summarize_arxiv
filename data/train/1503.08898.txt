    "the razumov - stroganov conjecture  @xcite , proved in 2011 by l.  cantini and a.  sportiello  @xcite who began calling it the _ razumov - stroganov correspondence _",
    "@xcite , provides an important bridge between the statistical physics of the @xmath0 dense loop model on a semi - infinite cylinder and combinatorial properties of _ alternating sign matrices_. the conjecture remained open for several years and intrigued many combinatorialists and physicists , motivating much cross - disciplinary work .",
    "cantini and sportiello s first proof  @xcite ( which proved not only the conjecture but also several generalizations ) relied on a detailed analysis of the action of _ gyration _ on _ fully - packed loops _ ,",
    "objects in bijection with alternating sign matrices .",
    "this paper relates cantini and sportiello s first proof  @xcite of the razumov - stroganov correspondence to both the _ toggle group _ and the _ homomesy phenomenon _ , which we describe in the following paragraphs .",
    "( cantini and sportiello also published a one - parameter refinement  @xcite of the razumov - stroganov correspondence in 2014 , in which they also proved some additional generalizations ; the present paper addresses only  @xcite , but the viewpoint described here could be a fruitful perspective on  @xcite as well . ) since this paper ties together several disparate topics , we aim to explain these concepts and connections in a manner accessible to readers in a variety of fields .",

    "the author investigated toggle group actions on many combinatorial objects that can be encoded as order ideals of a poset , such as subsets , partitions , catalan objects , certain plane partitions , and alternating sign matrices .",
    "in many cases , known actions on these objects could be expressed as toggle group actions  @xcite .",
    "the authors also used conjugacy of toggle group elements to show that different combinatorially meaningful actions have the same orbit structure , in many cases giving easy proofs of the _ cyclic sieving phenomenon _ of v.  reiner , d.  stanton , and d.  white  @xcite . the relevant result from  @xcite for the purpose of this paper we list as proposition  [ prop : asmgyr ] , namely , that gyration on fully - packed loops can be expressed as a toggle group action .",
    "the _ homomesy phenomenon _ was isolated in 2013 by j.  propp and t.  roby  @xcite . a statistic on a set of combinatorial objects exhibits _ homomesy _ ( or is _ homomesic _ ) with respect to a bijective action if the average value of the statistic on any orbit of the action is equal to the global average value of the statistic .",
    "that is , the orbit - average of the statistic is independent of the chosen orbit . in  @xcite , propp and roby",
    "investigated homomesy of toggle group actions in certain posets and also noted that homomesy occurs in many other contexts ; this has been a growing area of research  @xcite  @xcite @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .    beyond relating the above concepts of homomesy and the toggle group to the razumov - stroganov correspondence , the main new contributions of this paper are two homomesy results on general posets which we hope will have broader implications . both results concern",
    "the _ toggleability _ statistic @xmath1 , which we introduce in definition  [ def : toggleability ] .",
    "the first new result involves _ rowmotion _ , a ubiquitous action studied in  @xcite and  @xcite .    given any finite poset @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath1 is homomesic with average value  @xmath4 with respect to rowmotion .    for the other new result , in definition  [ def : gyr ]",

    "n. williams and the author proved that @xmath5 on the alternating sign matrix poset reduces to wieland s gyration on fully - packed loops .",
    "thus , when specialized to the case of the alternating sign matrix poset , theorem  [ thm : genposet ] yields lemma 4.1 from cantini and sportiello s proof of the razumov - stroganov conjecture  @xcite .",
    "we list this result as corollary  [ cor : asmcor ] .",

    "place one of the following two tiles :   or , where each is chosen with probability @xmath132 .",
    "note that , almost certainly , each path that begins at one of the @xmath103 points on the finite end of the cylinder will terminate at another of these endpoints , rather than going off to infinity ; see lemma 1.6 of  @xcite .",
    "so each configuration of the cylinder induces a link pattern ( or noncrossing matching ) on the @xmath103 endpoints .",
    "an alternative statement of the razumov - stroganov conjecture is the following .",
    "let @xmath133 be the vector of length @xmath128 that gives the probability distribution by link pattern of configurations of the @xmath0 dense loop model on a semi - infinite cylinder of circumference @xmath103 ( this is called the _ ground state eigenvector _ ) . then @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the number of @xmath61 alternating sign matrices ( or fully - packed loops of order @xmath54 ) .",
    "we get from this statement to the statement of theorem  [ thm : razstrogcomb ] as follows .",
    "consider the markov process defined by adding a row to the cylinder with each of the @xmath103 new tiles chosen from the two possibilities with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath136 .",
    "it can be shown , using either the yang - baxter equation ( see , for example , section 4 of  @xcite ) or a bijective approach ( see section 3 of  @xcite ) that the associated transfer matrices with different values of @xmath8 commute , so that , surprisingly , the probability distribution by link pattern is independent of @xmath8 .",
    "so we can consider , rather , the limit @xmath137 .",
    "( see , for example , theorem 1.8 and appendix b of  @xcite . )",
    "thus , a new row of the cylinder usually consists of all one type of tile ; this serves to rotate the link pattern by the action of the rotation operator @xmath116 .",
    "but , occasionally , there will be a single tile of the other type in the new row .",
    "in this situation , the effect on the link pattern amounts to the rotation @xmath116 combined with the action of a temperley - lieb operator @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the action on the link pattern of adding a row in the markov process is given by @xmath116 or @xmath138 for some @xmath139 .",
    "so the probability distribution by link pattern of configurations of the @xmath0 dense loop model on a semi - infinite cylinder is equal to the probability distribution by link pattern of the temperley - lieb markov process .",
    "in 2013 , j.  propp and t.  roby isolated and named the _ homomesy _ phenomenon ( greek for `` same middle '' )  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when given a set of combinatorial objects , a bijective action on this set , and a combinatorial statistic associated to each object in the set , the average value of this statistic over an orbit of the action is the same no matter which orbit you consider .",
    "that is , this average on an orbit equals the global average value of the statistic .",
    "we state this more formally in the following definition , in slightly less generality than in @xcite .    given a finite set @xmath32 of combinatorial objects , an invertible map @xmath140 from @xmath32 to itself , and a _ combinatorial statistic _ on @xmath32 , that is , a map @xmath141 , we say the triple @xmath142 exhibits _ homomesy _ if and only if there exists a constant @xmath143 such that for every @xmath140-orbit @xmath144 @xmath145 in this situation we say that the statistic @xmath146 is _ homomesic _ ( or @xmath147-_mesic _ ) relative to the action of @xmath140 on @xmath32 .    in the same paper  @xcite , propp and roby proved that homomesy occurs in the case where the set @xmath32 equals the set of order ideals of the product of two chains poset , the action @xmath140 is rowmotion , and the statistic @xmath146 is either the size of the order ideal or the size of the corresponding antichain of maximal elements",
    ". they also proved that the size of the order ideal statistic is homomesic under _ promotion _ , a toggle group action shown in  @xcite to be conjugate to rowmotion .",
    "homomesy has been a growing area of research , with further results found on other posets  @xcite  @xcite , semistandard young tableaux  @xcite , oscillating tableaux  @xcite , and piecewise - linear generalizations of toggle group actions  @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we prove that rowmotion and another of its conjugates exhibits homomesy with respect to a statistic isolating the _ toggleability _ of a poset element .",
    "we then apply this result to the razumov - stroganov correspondence .",
    "in this section , we first define a statistic on order ideals which isolates the _ toggleability _ of an element in the poset .",
    "we then show that this statistic is homomesic with respect to both rowmotion ( lemma  [ lem : rowhomomesy ] ) and @xmath5 ( theorem  [ thm : genposet ] ) , where @xmath5 is the toggle group action given in definition  [ def : gyr ] which corresponds to fpl gyration .",
    "finally , we obtain a key lemma from cantini and sportiello s proof of the razumov - stroganov correspondence  @xcite , as a corollary of theorem  [ thm : genposet ] .",
    "[ def : toggleability ] fix a finite poset @xmath2 . for each @xmath42 , define the _ toggleability _ statistic @xmath148 as follows :    @xmath149    given an order ideal @xmath38 , the poset elements @xmath8 for which @xmath150 are called the _ toggleable _",
    "elements of @xmath2 for @xmath38 , since these are precisely the elements of @xmath2 for which the toggle @xmath49 acts nontrivially on @xmath38 .",
    "[ lem : rowhomomesy ] given any finite poset @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath1 is 0-mesic with respect to rowmotion .",
    "consider @xmath34 .",
    "then it follows immediately from definition  [ def : row ] ( for rowmotion ) and definition  [ def : toggleability ] ( for the toggleability statistic ) that the four statements @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are all equivalent .",
    "therefore , the only possibilities for @xmath155 are @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . hence , along any orbit of @xmath51 , the nonzero values of @xmath1 alternate in sign ( with no 0 s separating a @xmath60 followed by a @xmath53 , but potentially arbitrarily many 0 s separating a @xmath53 followed by a @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is not true that we automatically get the same result for all toggle group actions conjugate to rowmotion .",
    "for example , in the poset @xmath161 with relations @xmath162 , the toggleability statistic @xmath163 is not homomesic with respect to _ promotion _ ( toggle in the order @xmath164 ) .",
    "but for the particular conjugate action of definition  [ def : gyr ] below , we prove in theorem  [ thm : genposet ] homomesy of the same statistic .",
    "[ def : gyr ] for any finite ranked poset @xmath2 , define _ gyration _",
    "@xmath165 as the toggle group action which toggles the elements in even ranks first , then odd ranks .",
    "recall from lemma  [ lem : commute ] that @xmath49 and @xmath50 commute whenever there is no cover relation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , all elements in ranks of the same parity commute , so the above definition is unambiguous .",
    "also , note that for any permutation of the ranks of a ranked poset , toggling the elements by rank according to that permutation is conjugate to rowmotion in the toggle group ( this is lemma 2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "so we have the following .    for any finite ranked poset @xmath2",
    ", there is an equivariant bijection between @xmath18 under @xmath51 and under @xmath5 , that is , @xmath51 and @xmath5 are conjugate elements in the toggle group @xmath46 .    in the alternating sign matrix case @xmath166",
    ", we have the following proposition , which follows directly from propositions  [ prop : togcorresp ] and  [ prop : oihf ] .",
    "[ prop : asmgyr ] @xmath5 acting on @xmath65 is equivalent to gyration on fully - packed loops of order @xmath54 .    in  @xcite ,",
    "n.  williams and the author used these two propositions to show the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : asmgyr ] @xmath65 under @xmath51 and fully - packed loop configurations of order @xmath54 under gyration are in equivariant bijection .    given the characterization from proposition  [ prop : asmgyr ] of wieland s gyration on fully - packed loop configurations in terms of the toggle group action @xmath5 , we now prove the following theorem about the toggleability statistic @xmath1 on any ranked poset .",
    "we then specialize to alternating sign matrices in corollary  [ cor : asmcor ] .",
    "[ thm : genposet ] given any finite ranked poset @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath1 is 0-mesic with respect to @xmath5 .    fix any @xmath3 .",
    "we claim that as you go through an orbit of @xmath5 , the nonzero values of @xmath1 alternate in sign .",
    "suppose @xmath8 is in a rank of even parity .",
    "( if @xmath8 is in a rank of odd parity , the argument follows similarly by considering the action of @xmath167 . )",
    "_ case 1 : _ if @xmath168 , then when the even ranks of @xmath2 are toggled , @xmath8 is removed from @xmath38 . then in the odd toggle step , if no element @xmath8 covers is removed , then @xmath169 ( _ case 2 _ ) , otherwise , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( _ case 4 _ ) .",
    "_ case 2 : _ if @xmath151 , then when the even ranks of @xmath2 are toggled , @xmath8 is added to the order ideal . then in the odd rank toggle step ,",
    "if no element covering @xmath8 is added , then @xmath172 ( _ case 1 _ ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath170 and @xmath173 ( _ case 3 _ ) .",
    "_ case 3 : _ if @xmath174 and @xmath16",
    ", then since @xmath8 is not toggleable , there must be some @xmath9 covering @xmath8 such that @xmath17 .",
    "so when the even ranks are toggled , @xmath8 remains in the order ideal .",
    "thus @xmath175 is either equal to @xmath53 ( _ case 1 _ ) or equals @xmath4 such that @xmath176 contains @xmath8 ( _ case 3 _ ) .",
    "_ case 4 : _ if @xmath174 and @xmath177 , then since @xmath8 is not toggleable , there must be some @xmath9 covered by @xmath8 such that @xmath178 .",
    "so when the elements in even ranks are toggled , @xmath8 continues to not be in the order ideal .",
    "thus @xmath175 can not equal @xmath53 and either equals @xmath60 ( _ case 2 _ ) or @xmath4 and @xmath171 ( _ case  4 _ ) .",
    "thus , the action of @xmath5 is as in the following graphic .",
    "therefore , the nonzero values of @xmath1 alternate in sign throughout an orbit of @xmath5 .",
    "lemma 4.1 from cantini and sportiello s 2011 proof of the razumov - stroganov conjecture follows from this theorem , when we specialize to the asm poset .",
    "we have listed a restatement of it here as a corollary .",
    "[ cor : asmcor ] fix any square @xmath179 in the @xmath94\\times [ n]$ ] grid",
    ". then the number of fpls in an orbit of gyration with edge configuration @xmath180 equals the number with configuration @xmath181 .",
    "as in lemma 4.1 of cantini - sportiello , let @xmath182 equal @xmath53 if the fpl edge configuration around @xmath179 is @xmath181 , @xmath183 if it is @xmath180 , and 0 otherwise . via the bijections of propositions  [",
    "prop : oihf ] and  [ prop : fplhf ] , the square @xmath179 in row @xmath113 column @xmath114 in the grid corresponds to the chain @xmath184 ; see figure  [ ex : aposetgyr ] .",
    "we noted in the proof of proposition  [ prop : oihf ] that the chain @xmath88 consists of poset elements all of which are in ranks of the same parity .",
    "since @xmath88 is a chain of elements in which no two have a covering relation , if we fix any order ideal @xmath38 , there will be at most one element @xmath185 such that @xmath150 . by proposition  [ prop : togcorresp ] ,",
    "summing the statistics on all the poset elements in @xmath88 gives the corresponding statistic on the square @xmath179 , that is , for any @xmath34 , @xmath186 .",
    "since each @xmath1 is 0-mesic on orbits of @xmath5 , @xmath182 is 0-mesic on orbits of gyration .",
    "thus the statement follows from the definition of @xmath182 .",
