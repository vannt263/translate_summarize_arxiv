    "market impact is the expected price change conditioned on initiating a trade of a given size and a given sign .",
    "understanding market impact is important for several reasons .",
    "one motivation is practical : to know whether a trade will be profitable it is essential to be able to estimate transaction costs , and in order to optimize a trading strategy to minimize such costs , it is necessary to understand the functional form of market impact .",
    "another motivation is ecological : impact exerts selection pressure against a fund becoming too large , and therefore is potentially important in determining the size distribution of funds . finally , an important motivation is theoretical : market impact reflects the shape of excess demand , the understanding of which has been a central problem in economics since the time of alfred marshall .    in this paper",
    "we present a theory for the market impact of large trading orders that are split into pieces and executed incrementally .",
    "we call these _ metaorders_. the true size of metaorders is typically not public information , a fact that plays a central role in our theory .",
    "the strategic reasons for incremental execution of metaorders were originally analyzed by kyle ( @xcite ) , who developed a model for an inside trader with monopolistic information about future prices .",
    "kyle showed that the optimal strategy for such a trader is to break her metaorder into pieces and execute it incrementally at a uniform rate , gradually incorporating her information into the price . in kyle s theory the price increases linearly with time as the trading takes place , and all else being equal , the total impact is a linear function of size .",
    "the prediction of linearity is reinforced by huberman and stanzl ( @xcite ) who show that , providing liquidity is constant , to prevent arbitrage permanent impact must be linear .",
    "real data contradict these predictions : metaorders do not show linear impact .",
    "empirical studies consistently find concave impact , i.e. impact per share decreases with size .",
    "it is in principle possible to reconcile the kyle model with concave dependence on size by making the additional hypothesis that larger metaorders contain less information per share than smaller ones , for example because more informed traders issue smaller metaorders .",
    "a drawback of this hypothesis is that it is neither parsimonious nor easily testable , and as we will argue here , under the assumptions of our model it violates market efficiency .",
    "huberman and stanzl are careful to specify that linearity only applies when liquidity is constant .",
    "in fact , liquidity fluctuates by orders of magnitude and has a large effect on price fluctuations .",
    "empirical studies find that order flow is extremely persistent , in the sense that the autocorrelation of order signs is positive and decays very slowly .",
    "no arbitrage arguments imply either fluctuating asymmetric liquidity as postulated by lillo and farmer ( @xcite ) , or no permanent impact , as discussed by bouchaud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the central goal of our model is to understand how order splitting affects market impact . whereas kyle assumed a single , monopolistic informed trader ,",
    "our informed traders are competitive .",
    "they submit their orders to an algorithmic execution service that bundles them together as one large metaorder and executes them incrementally .",
    "we show that this leads to a symmetric nash equilibrium satisfying the condition that the final price after a metaorder is executed equals its average transaction price .",
    "we call this condition _ fair pricing _ , to emphasize the fact that under this assumption trading a metaorder is a breakeven deal  neither party makes a profit as a result of trading . our equilibrium is less general than kyle s in that it assumes uniform execution , but it is more general in that it allows an arbitrary information distribution .",
    "this is key because , as we show , there is an equilibrium between information and metaorder size , making it possible to match the metaorder size distribution to empirical data .",
    "combining the fair pricing condition with a martingale condition makes it possible to derive the price impact of metaorders as a function of the metaorder size distribution .",
    "this allows us to make several strong predictions based on a simple set of hypotheses . for a given metaorder size distribution",
    "it predicts the average impact as a function of time both during and after execution .",
    "we thus predict the relationship between the functional form of two observable quantities with no a priori relationship , making our theory falsifiable in a strong sense .",
    "this is in contrast to theories that make assumptions about the functional form of utility and/or behavioral or institutional assumptions about the informativeness of trades , which typically leave room for interpretation and require auxiliary assumptions to make empirical tests .    for example , gabaix et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have also argued that the distribution of trading volume plays a central role in determining impact , and have derived a formula for impact that is concave under some circumstances . however , in contrast to our model , their prediction for market impact depends sensitively on the functional form for risk aversion , where @xmath0 is the standard deviation of profits , the impact will increase with the size @xmath1 of the metaorder as @xmath2 .",
    "thus the impact is concave if @xmath3 , linear if @xmath4 ( i.e. if risk is proportional to variance ) , and convex otherwise .",
    "for another theory that also predicts concave impact see toth et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . ] . our theory , in contrast , is based entirely on market efficiency and does not depend on the functional form of utility .",
    "our work here is related to several papers that study market design .",
    "viswanathan and wang ( @xcite ) , glosten ( @xcite ) , and back and baruch ( @xcite ) derive and compare the equilibrium transaction prices of orders submitted to markets with uniform vs. discriminatory pricing . depending on the setup of the model , these prices can be different so that investors will prefer one pricing structure to the other and can potentially be  cream - skimmed \" by a competing exchange .",
    "the fair pricing condition we introduce here forces the average transaction price of a metaorder ( which transacts at discriminatory prices ) to be equal to the price that would be set under uniform pricing .",
    "fair pricing , therefore , means investors have no preference between the two pricing structures , and they have no incentive to search out arrangements for better execution . on the surface",
    ", this result is similar to the equivalence of uniform and discriminatory pricing in back and baruch ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in their paper , this equivalence results because orders are always allowed to be split , whereas ours is a true equivalence between the pricing of a split vs. unsplit order .    in section ii",
    "we give a description of the model and discuss its interpretation . in section iii",
    "we develop the consequences of the martingale condition and show how this leads to zero overall profits and asymmetric price responses when order flow is persistent .",
    "in section iv we show that any nash equilibrium must satisfy the fair pricing condition . in section",
    "v we derive in general terms what this implies about market impact . in section",
    "vi we introduce specific functional forms for the metaorder size distribution and explicitly compute the impact for these cases .",
    "finally , in section vii we discuss the empirical implications of the model and make some concluding remarks .",
    "we study a stylized model of an algorithmic trading service combining and executing orders of long - term traders .",
    "this can be thought of as a broker - dealer receiving multiple orders on the same security and executing them algorithmically at the same time , or as an institutional trading desk of a large asset manager combining the orders from multiple portfolio managers into one large metaorder .",
    "our goal is to model the price impact of a metaorder during a trading period in which it may or may not be present .",
    "we set up the model in a stylized manner as a game in which trading takes place across multiple periods , after which final prices are revealed . while this is somewhat artificial in comparison to a real market ( which has no such thing as a  final \" price ) , the framework is simple enough to allow us to find a solution , and the basic conclusions should apply more broadly .",
    "the structure of the model is in many respects similar to the classic framework of kyle ( @xcite ) , but with several important differences .",
    "( a point - by - point comparison is made in the conclusions ) .",
    "we begin with an overview .",
    "there is a single asset which is traded in each of @xmath1 periods , which can be regarded as a game .",
    "there are three kinds of agents , long - term traders , market makers and day traders .",
    "the long - term traders have a common information signal that is received before the game starts ; based on this information they formulate their orders and submit them to an algorithmic trading service .",
    "the algorithmic service operates mechanically , dividing the bundle of orders ( which we call a _ metaorder _ ) into equal sized lots which are submitted as anonymous market orders in each successive period until the metaorder is fully executed .",
    "the day traders , in contrast , receive a new information signal and submit orders based on this signal in every period of the game . in every period",
    "each market maker observes the netted order of the long - term and day traders and submits a quote accordingly ; all orders are filled at the best price .",
    "the game ends with a final liquidation period at time step @xmath5 in which prices are set exogenously to reflect the accumulated information .",
    "the length @xmath1 of the game varies based on the amount of information received , and is unknown to the market makers .",
    "we now discuss the setup of the game in more detail , beginning with a description of each of the agents .",
    "the _ long - term traders _ receive a common information signal @xmath6 before the game begins , which only they observe . in order to model situations in which there may or may not be a metaorder present , we allow a nonzero probability that @xmath7 . thus with probability @xmath8 the signal @xmath6 is drawn from a distribution @xmath9 , which has nonzero support over a continuous interval @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , and with probability @xmath12",
    "there is no information , i.e. @xmath7 . for simplicity we discuss the case where the draw of @xmath6 happens to be positive , i.e. it causes the final price to increase , but the results apply equally well if @xmath6 is negative .",
    "after @xmath6 is revealed the orders of the long - term traders are aggregated together into a _ metaorder _ and executed in a package .",
    "the bundling and execution process can be thought of as representing an algorithmic trading firm , broker , or institutional trading desk .",
    "there are @xmath13 long - term traders , labeled by an index @xmath14 , where @xmath13 is a large number . after the common information signal",
    "is received each long - term trader submits an order of size @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a large positive integer .",
    "each long - term trader decides @xmath17 independently .",
    "the individual orders are bundled together into a metaorder of size @xmath18 shares .    .",
    "for this figure we assume the metaorder is present and show only expected price paths , averaged over the day trader s information .",
    "the price is initially @xmath19 ; after the first lot is executed it is @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 it is finished and the price reverts to @xmath22 , but if @xmath23 another lot is executed and it rises to @xmath24 .",
    "this proceeds similarly until the execution of the metaorder is completed . at any given point",
    "the probability that the metaorder has size @xmath25 , i.e. that the order continues , is @xmath26 . if had we followed a typical price path under circumstances when the day trader s noisy information signal is large , rather than the expected price paths shown here , the sequence of prices would be a random walk with a time - varying drift caused by the metaorder s impact . ]",
    "the algorithmic trading firm operates purely mechanically , chopping the metaorder into equal pieces and submitting market orders at successive times @xmath27 .",
    "these are executed at transaction prices @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we assume the metaorder is executed in lots , which for mathematical convenience are chosen to be of @xmath13 shares .",
    "the imposition of a maximum trade size @xmath30 is a technical detail , which induces a bound on @xmath30 , to avoid mathematical problems that occur in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "this is explained in the appendix .",
    "for the typical situations we have in mind @xmath30 , @xmath13 , and @xmath32 are all large numbers .",
    "the choice of lots of size @xmath13 shares is purely a matter of convenience ; the assumption that the lots have a constant size is something we hope can be relaxed in the future . ]",
    "; we assume that @xmath30 is large .",
    "if the metaorder is present ( i.e. if @xmath33 ) , trading ends when the metaorder is fully executed , i.e. when @xmath34 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of metaorder lengths is @xmath35 . if @xmath7 we randomly choose a value of @xmath1 from an arbitrary distribution @xmath36 ( which in general differs from @xmath35 ) .",
    "the _ day traders _ can be treated as a single representative agent who receives a private information signal @xmath37 at the beginning of each period @xmath38 of the game , and submits a market order ( either to buy or sell ) of size @xmath39 , where @xmath37 is a zero mean iid noise process with an otherwise arbitrary distribution @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is an increasing function is not important here .",
    "we assume the day traders do not engage in order splitting , i.e. they trade on the information they receive in given time step only in that time step .",
    "this guarantees that in the absence of a metaorder the day trader s order flow provides a sufficient signal for a market maker to infer the new information . ] .",
    "there is no restriction on the size of @xmath42 , and in particular we allow the possibility that @xmath37 is large and negative while @xmath6 is positive , so that during the course of execution of the metaorder the combined order flow may change sign , and that at different times the market makers may buy or sell .    at each time",
    "step the market orders of the long - term traders and the day trader are netted and the single combined order is submitted to the _ market makers _ , who are competitive and profit maximizing .",
    "we are not assuming any special institutional privileges , such as those of the specialists in the nyse ; our market makers are simply competitive liquidity providers . at each time step",
    "each market maker observes the combined order and submits a quote .",
    "the combined order is fully executed by the market maker(s ) offering the best price .",
    "the market makers are able to take past order flow and prices into account in setting their quotes . given that @xmath37 is iid , the typical transaction price sequence @xmath43 will look like a random walk , as the market maker responds to the day trader s order flow , with a possible superimposed drift if a metaorder is present .",
    "in the final period @xmath44 the combination of the long - term information @xmath6 and the accumulated short term information are revealed . since the long - term traders information signals are independent of those of the day trader , information is additive and the final price is @xmath45 where @xmath19 is the initial price .",

    "the goal of the paper is to compute the _ average immediate impact _ @xmath50 and the _ average permanent impact _",
    "@xmath51 of the metaorder .",
    "the corresponding incremental average impacts are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as we will show , at the equilibrium the average impacts do not depend on @xmath8 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "the number of long - term traders @xmath13 is fixed and is common knowledge .",
    "the market makers know the initial price @xmath19 , the information distributions @xmath9 and @xmath40 , they can deduce the function @xmath41 relating the day trader s information to their order size , and they observe the net combined order in each period and remember previous order flow .",
    "however they do not know the information signals @xmath6 or @xmath37 , and thus they do not know how much of the order flow to ascribe to the long - term trader vs. the day trader . they do not know whether a metaorder is present , and if it is , they do not know its size .",
    "perhaps the strongest assumption we have made concerns knowledge of the timing of metaorders . the market makers know the period @xmath38 , and as a result if a metaorder is present , they know when it started . in typical market settings order flow is anonymous and the starting time of a metaorder is uncertain .",
    "nonetheless , for long meta - orders and sufficiently high participation rates the starting time can be inferred from the imbalance in order flow , where @xmath56 is the desired number of standard deviations of statistical significance .",
    "the accumulated imbalance after @xmath38 steps is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the participation rate .",
    "equating these gives @xmath59 .",
    "hiding an order of size @xmath1 requires @xmath60 .",
    "thus larger metaorders need to be executed more slowly to avoid detection .",
    "since the time needed to complete execution is inversely proportional @xmath58 , for a large metaorder this can become prohibitive  it is impossible to escape detection . ] . assuming a typical participation rate of @xmath61 and two standard deviations to reject the null hypothesis of balanced order flow means that a metaorder can be detected after about @xmath62 timesteps .",
    "large metaorders are frequently executed in @xmath63 or even @xmath64 lots share of ibm . ] , implying an error in inferring the starting time of @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "thus , it is not unrealistic to imagine that market makers can infer the presence of large metaorders and estimate their starting times .",
    "we are not concerned here with the question of whether or not the algorithmic execution service s strategy of splitting the order into equal pieces is an optimal strategy .",
    "our goal is instead to assume that this is what they do , and to derive the implications for price impact .",
    "our main result is to derive the equilibrium relationship between the metaorder size distribution @xmath35 and the average immediate and permanent impacts @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in addition to taking expectations over the day trader s noise @xmath42 , which we denote by @xmath47 , we must compute expectations about the length of the game .",
    "the crux of our argument hinges around the market makers ignorance of @xmath6 ; when @xmath33 this translates into uncertainty about metaorder size .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath69 to represent an average over all metaorders of size @xmath70 , and as described above , @xmath47 for averages over @xmath37 . for a generic function",
    "@xmath71 the average over metaorder sizes is @xmath72 = \\sum_{n = t}^\\infty q_n f_n= \\frac{\\sum_{n = t}^\\infty p_n f_n}{\\sum_{n = t}^\\infty p_{n}}= \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty p_{it } f_{it}}{\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty p_{it } } , e_t[f_n ] = \\frac{\\sum_{n = t}^m p_n f_n}{\\sum_{n = t}^m p_{n}}= \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{m - t } p_{t+i } f_{t+i}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{m - t } p_{t+i } } , \\label{averages}\\ ] ] where in the last term we made the substitution @xmath73 .    assuming that a metaorder is present , the likelihood that it will persist depends on the distribution @xmath35 and the number of executions @xmath38 that it has already experienced",
    "let @xmath74 be the probability that the metaorder will continue given that it is still active at timestep @xmath38 .",
    "this is equivalent to the probability that it is at least of size @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath75 this makes precise how order splitting can make order flow positively autocorrelated . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath35 has heavy tails than an exponential @xmath26 will increase with time and induce persistence in order flow .",
    "in the case where no metaorder is present one can similarly define the probability that the game continues as @xmath76",
    "in this section we introduce a martingale condition and discuss its implications for liquidity and overall profitability .",

    "this means that the price response if the order continues is much less it is than if it stops .    to complete the calculation",

    "we can use @xmath35 as a proxy for @xmath9 , which is the key fact allowing us to state our results in terms of the observable quantity @xmath35 rather than @xmath9 , which is much more difficult to observe .",
    "although this derivation is based on rationality , the fair pricing condition potentially stands on its own , even if other aspects of rationality and efficiency are violated . in modern markets portfolio managers routinely receive trade cost analysis reports",
    "that compare their execution prices relative to the close , which for a trade that takes place over one day is a good proxy for @xmath110 .",
    "such reports are typically broken down into size bins , making persistent inconsistencies across sizes clear .",

    "what we observe is that when @xmath198 the impact is roughly unchanged from its behavior in the limit @xmath31 , but when @xmath199 the impact becomes highly convex .",

    "2 .   the asymmetric price response predicted by eq .",
    "[ returnratio ] is testable .",
    "however , this only tests the martingale condition , which is the less controversial part of our model .",
    "the equivalence of impact as a function of time and size is directly testable . under our theory , for @xmath25",
    "the immediate impact from the first @xmath38 steps is the same , regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "this is in contrast to the kyle model which predicts linear impact as a function of time , but can explain concavity in size only by postulating variable informativeness of trades vs. metaorder size .",
    "the prediction of immediate and permanent impact based on @xmath35 is directly testable through equations  [ final ] and [ generalpermanentimpact ] .",
    "if the metaorder distribution is a power law ( pareto distribution ) , then for large @xmath1 the immediate impact scales as @xmath213 and the ratio of the permanent to the immediate impact of the last transaction is @xmath214 .",
    "see section  [ paretosec ] .",
    "prediction ( 2 ) has been tested and confirmed by lillo and farmer ( @xcite ) , farmer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and gerig ( @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary results seem to support , or at least not contradict , prediction ( 5 ) . the only studies of which we are aware that attempted to fit functional form to the impact of metaorders are by torre ( @xcite ) , almgren et al .",
    "@xcite , and moro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; they find immediate impact roughly consistent with a square root functional form .",
    "moro et al . also tested the ratio of permanent to immediate impact and found @xmath215 for the spanish stock market and @xmath216 for the london stock market , with large error bars . to our knowledge",
    "the other predictions remain to be empirically tested .      though the market makers in our model are uncertain whether or not a metaorder is present , if it is present , they know when its execution begins and ends . the ability to detect metaorders from imbalances in order flow using brokerage codes has been demonstrated [ ( vaglica et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ( toth et al @xcite ) ] .",
    "a recent study of metaorders based on brokerage code information found average participation rates of @xmath217 for the spanish stock market ( bme ) and @xmath218 for the london stock market , for metaorders whose average size was just under @xmath62 in both markets , making such metaorders difficult to hide .",
    "the detection problem introduces uncertainties in starting and stopping times that may affect shape of the price impact .",
    "the traditional view in finance is that market impact is just a reflection of information .",
    "this point of view often goes a step further and postulates that the functional form of impact is determined by behavioral and institutional factors , such as how informed the agents are who trade with a given volume .",
    "this hypothesis is difficult to test because it is inherently complicated and information is difficult to measure independently of impact . within the framework developed here",
    ", such anomalies would violate the fair pricing condition .",
    "in this paper we embrace the view that impact reflects information , but we show how at equilibrium the trading volume reflects the underlying information and makes it possible to compute the impact .",
    "the metaorder size distribution determines the shape of the impact but does not set its scale .",
    "metaorder size has the important advantage of being a measurable quantity , and thus predictions based on it are much more testable than those based directly on information .",
    "the fair pricing condition that we have derived here may well hold on its own , even without informational efficiency .",
    "this could be true for purely behavioral reasons : the fair pricing condition holds because it can be measured reliably , and both parties view it as fair .",
    "thus while the main results here are consistent with rationality , they do not necessarily depend on it .",
    "we provide an example solution for the pareto distribution for metaorder size because we believe that the evidence supports this hypothesis .",
    "this gives the simple result that the impact is a power law of the form @xmath219 , and the ratio of permanent impact to the temporary impact of the last transaction is @xmath214 .",
    "however , the bulk of our results do not depend on this assumption .",
    "thus the reader who is skeptical about power laws may simply view the results for the pareto distribution as a worked example .",
    "the strength of our approach is its empirical predictions . because these involve explicit functional relationships between observable variables they are strongly falsifiable in the popperian sense .",
