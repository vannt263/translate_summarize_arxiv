    "ndal@xmath0 , upd@xmath0al@xmath1 and ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 are all metallic compounds . the aim of this paper is to study crystal - field ( cef ) effects in these metallic compounds owing to the fact that still the concept and the use of the crystal - field approach is questioned , if applied to metallic compounds .",
    "there are opinions that obtained agreements with many experimental data within the cef - based approaches are accidental ( for further details of these reproaches see arxiv / cond - mat/0504199 ) . for us",
    "the many - electron cef approach is obvious and well founded in solid - state physics .",
    "the many - electron cef approach captures the essential physics of transition - metal compounds .",
    "we think that much of the localized / itinerant controversy is related to misunderstandings due to a long - lasting lack of the open scientific discussion that would allow for good , scientifically clear , formulation of the subject of the controversy .",
    "the cef is a result of an inhomogeneous charge distribution in a solid .",
    "so , it is everywhere .",
    "another problem is its quantification . in a crystal due to the translational symmetry and a high point symmetry the cef potential can be quantified by cef coefficients that reflect multipolar charge moments of the surroundings . a transition - metal cation with the incomplete 4f/5f shell serves as a probe of this cef multipolar potential showing the discrete splitting of the localized 4f/5f states .",
    "here we will present this discrete splitting of the localized 4f/5f states in ndal@xmath0 , upd@xmath0al@xmath1 and ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the shown transition - metal cations have in these compounds an odd number of 4f/5f electrons .",
    "thus , they have charge - formed kramers doublet ground state . due to the presence of the orbital moment",
    "all of these compounds can serve as example of the anisotropic spin lattice , here chosen in a sequence of the lowering ordering temperature .",
    "ndal@xmath0 crystallizes in the cubic mgcu@xmath0 structure and orders ferromagnetically below 65 k [ 1 ] . among other papers in ref . 2",
    "it has been shown that its magnetic and electronic properties are very well described as being predominantly determined by the nd@xmath5 ion with the 4f@xmath6 configuration . in ref .",
    "2 the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment and of the heat capacity have been calculated .",
    "1 , similar to that shown in ref .",
    "[ 2 ] - here we use the same parameters , only we derive now more physical quantities , shows a discrete electronic structure of 10 lowest localized states originating from the lowest multiplet j=9/2 .",
    "the 4f@xmath6 configuration has in total 120 localized states .",
    "the localized f electrons coexist with itinerant electrons originating from outer 3 nd electrons and from outer al electrons .",
    "itinerant electrons form a band and are responsible for the conductivity .",
    "their contribution to the magnetic moment or to the heat capacity , for instance , is negligible in comparison to that of localized electrons .",
    "the crystal - field splitting amounts to 160 k. magnetic interactions enlarge this splitting to 350 k. the calculated magnetic moment at 0 k of 2.62 @xmath7 is in good agreement with the experimental datum of 2.5@xmath80.2 @xmath7 [ 1 ] .",
    "the calculated total moment is composed from the spin moment m@xmath9 = 3.35 @xmath7 and orbital moment m@xmath10=-0.73 @xmath7 . for calculations we make use of a single - ion like hamiltonian for the ground multiplet j=9/2 [ 2 ] : +   + h  =  @xmath11  +  @xmath12  = @xmath13    in equation ( 1 ) the first term is the ( cubic ) crystal - field hamiltonian with b@xmath14= -11.48 mk and b@xmath15= + 0.464 mk .",
    "these parameters yield the multipolar moment of the nd surroundings a@xmath16 = b@xmath17/(@xmath18 @xmath19 of a@xmath14=+13.5 ka@xmath20 and a@xmath15=-0.81 ka@xmath21 .",
    "@xmath18 is a respective stevens factor of the ground multiplet and @xmath19 is the respective power of the 4f radius .",
    "the second term takes into account intersite spin - dependent interactions ( n@xmath22 - molecular field coefficient , magnetic moment @xmath23 = -@xmath24j@xmath7 , @xmath24=8/11 - lande factor ) - it produces the magnetic order below t@xmath25 what is seen in fig . 1 as the appearance of the splitting of the kramers doublets and in experiment as the @xmath26-peak in the heat capacity at t@xmath27 .",
    "upd@xmath0al@xmath1 exhibits supercoductivity below 2 k coexisting with antiferromagnetism that appears below 14 k [ 3,4 ] .",
    "a controversy is related to description of f electrons , itinerant or localized in a number of 2 or 3 . in our refs .",
    "[ 5 ] and [ 6 ] , in contrary to authors of refs [ 7,8 ] claiming the 5f@xmath30 configuration , we have interpreted the excitations observed by krimmel _",
    "[ 9 ] as related to the energy level scheme : 0 , 7 mev ( 81 k ) , 10 mev ( 116 k ) and 23.4 mev ( 271 k ) of the @xmath31 ( u@xmath5 ) configuration .",
    "the fine electronic structure of the @xmath31 ( u@xmath5 ) consists of five kramers doublets split by multipolar charge interactions ( cef interactions ) .",
    "the fine electronic structure originates from the lowest multiplet @xmath32i@xmath33 , higher multiplets are at least 0.2 ev above and do not affect practically the ground - multiplet properties .",
    "these 5 doublets are further split in the antiferromagnetic state , i.e. below t@xmath34 of 14 k as is shown in fig .",
    "2 . for calculations we make use the same hamiltonian as for the nd ion in ndal@xmath0 . a derived set of cef parameters of the hexagonal symmetry : b@xmath35=+5.3 k , b@xmath36=+40 mk , b@xmath37=-0.02 mk and b@xmath38=+26 mk yields states at 81 k , 120 k ,",
    "270 k and 460 k , energies of which are in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed excitations .",
    "the highest state was not observed in ins experiment .",
    "this electronic structure accounts also surprisingly well for the overall temperature dependence of the heat capacity , the substantial uranium magnetic moment and its direction [ 6 ] .    in fig .",
    "3 we present temperature dependence of the splitting energy between two conjugate kramers ground state .",
    "surprisingly , both the value of the energy and its temperature dependence is in close agreement to a low - energy excitation of 1.7 mev at t=0 k observed by sato _",
    "[ 8 ] which has been attributed by them to a magnetic exciton .",
    "we are convinced that the 5f@xmath39(u@xmath5 ) scheme provides a physical explanation for the 1.7 mev excitation ( magnetic exciton ) - this excitation is associated to the removal of the kramers - doublet ground state degeneracy in the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 is one of a hallmark heavy - fermion compound with a kondo temperature t@xmath43 of 25 - 30 k. it becomes recently of great scientific importance after the discovery in prof .",
    "f. steglich group [ 10 ] of the well - defined electrons spin resonance ( esr ) signal at temperature so low as 1.5 k similar to the esr signal observed in conventional diluted yb alloys with the yb@xmath5 ion . according to the kondo model below t@xmath43",
    "there should not be discrete states .",
    "the derived @xmath24 tensor is very anisotropic : @xmath44 = 3.561 and @xmath45 = 0.17 at 5 k. at 2 k @xmath44 decreases to 3.50 . in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] we have derived two sets of cef parameters that yield two kramers doublet ground - state eigenfunctions , @xmath46 or @xmath47 , that reproduce this g tensor at 5 k :    @xmath46 = 0.944 @xmath48 + 0.322 @xmath49 -    -0.052 @xmath50 - 0.047 @xmath51    @xmath52 = 0.803 @xmath53 + 0.595 @xmath54 -    -0.027 @xmath55",
    "- 0.009 @xmath56    in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] we have proposed a physical experiment in order to distinguish these two ground states .",
    "we have calculated temperature dependence of the quadrupolar interactions for these two states .",
    "as it is very different for these two ground states the mossbauer experiment should easily distinguish them .",
    "for perfect reproduction of the @xmath24 tensor within the fully - localized crystal - field model it was necessary to introduce the cef b@xmath57 term .",
    "it indicates lowering of the tetragonal symmetry of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 at low temperatures to the orthorhombic symmetry .",
    "the increase of this distortion with lowering temperature is , according to us , the reason for temperature variation of the @xmath24 tensor .",
    "a success in description of ndal@xmath0 within the atomic - based cef approach is related to a fact that there is only one crystallographic nd site up to lowest temperatures . due to",
    "the kramers doublet ground state being not susceptible to the charge surroundings and due to relatively large separation to the first excited state mechanisms leading to a lowering symmetry are not effective as by them the system can not gain energy .",
    "ndal@xmath0 being ferromagnet assures conditions for all nd moments to have the same magnetic interactions .",
    "it causes that all nd ions equally contribute to the macroscopic magnetization and thermodynamical properties . as a consequence",
    ", the macroscopic molar values are obtained from the atomic - scale properties by simple multiplication by the avogadro number .",
    "we advocate by years for the importance of the crystal - field approach in 4f/5f compounds , also in those exhibiting heavy - fermion phenomena .",
    "of course , we do not claim that cef explains everything ( surely cef itself can not explain the formation of a magnetic ordering , for which in eq .",
    "1 we add the second term ) , but surely the atomic - like 4f/5f/3d cation is the source of the magnetism of a whole solid .",
    "the atomic - scale magnetic moment is determined by local effects known as crystal field and spin - orbit interactions as well as very strong electron correlations .",
    "these strong electron correlations are predominantly of the intra - atomic origin and taking into account , in the first approximation , via on - site hund s rules .",
    "these strong correlations lead to many - electron version of the cef approach .",
    "finally , we use a name `` @xmath58 electrons '' , as often is used in literature .",
    "of course , @xmath58 electrons are not special electrons but it means electrons in @xmath58 states .",
    "@xmath58 states have well defined characteristics , like the orbital quantum number @xmath59 . by identifying states in a solid we can identified @xmath58 electrons , in particular their number .",
    "owing to a debate on the formation and a role of localized crystal - field states in conducting magnetic materials we point out that in metallic compounds localized crystal - field states coexist with conduction electrons .",
    "the former are predominantly responsible for magnetic and low - energy spectroscopic properties , the latter for the conduction .    in ndal@xmath0 and upd@xmath0al@xmath1",
    "we illustrate the physical realization of the anisotropic spin liquid ( lattice of kramers ions with an odd number of electrons ) , that is unstable with respect to spin fluctuations for t@xmath20 k. in these three compounds the magnetic ordering temperature decreases from 65 k via 14 k to 0.07 k only in case of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty in the removal of the kramers degeneracy in case of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 is , according to us , the reason for the quantum critical point phenomena observed at ultra - low temperatures .    in our atomic - start approach to 3d-/4f-/5f - atom containing compounds we take into account crystal field and spin - orbit interactions as well as very strong electron correlations , predominantly of the intra - atomic origin .",
