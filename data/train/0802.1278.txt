    "tlm98 showed that the outer ( adjustment ) radius of the transition layer ( cc ) @xmath21 measured in the dimensionless units with respect to schwarzschild radius @xmath22 , @xmath23 , anticorrelates with @xmath19number or photon index @xmath7 ( spectral state ) only .",
    "thus @xmath15 ( or @xmath9 ) as a ratio @xmath24 should correlate with @xmath7 ( or @xmath19number ) where values @xmath15 related to the same @xmath7 for different sources should be inversely proportional to a mass of the central object ( black hole or neutron star ) .",
    "note that a plasma velocity @xmath25 is also a function of @xmath7 only .",
    "the comparison of the observed index ",
    "qpo frequency correlations for two different sources ( with two different masses ) should lead to determination of their relative masses with respect each other .",
    "this is the main idea behind the method of weighing black holes ( tlm98 ) recently applied for bh mass determination in a number of galactic and extragalactic sources [ see tf04 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of the truncated keplerian disk and hot corona located in the innermost part of the source using arguments in terms of radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "@xcite , hereafter cgr99 , were the first who supported this model using the specific form of the power spectra of x - ray radiation .",
    "particularly they noted that two - component x - ray spectra ( soft multicolour black - body and harder power law ) are frequently observed from accreting black holes .",
    "these components are presumably associated with the different parts of the accretion flow ( optically thick and optically thin respectively ) in the vicinity of the compact source .",
    "they also emphasized that for cygnus x-1 , the overall shape of the power density spectra in the soft and hard spectral states can be _ qualitatively _ explained if the geometrically thin disc is sandwiched by the geometrically thick corona extending in a radial direction up to a large distance from the compact object . in the hard state",
    "the thin disc is truncated at some distance from the black hole followed by the geometrically thick flow .",
    "the break in the pds is then associated with the characteristic frequencies in the accretion flow at the thin disc truncation radius .",
    "however there is a difference between cgr99 s suggestions and the results of our paper .",
    "we come to the model of the truncated disk plus corona using the fit of the theoretical model of the power spectrum ( see tsa07 ) to the data . whereas cgr99 proposed a _ qualitative _ explanation of the data using lyubarskii s idea on the formation of the power spectrum in x - ray binaries",
    "[ see l97 ] .",
    "our results confirm the cgr99 conclusion that a stable optically thick ( but geometrically thin ) disk extends down to small radii ( as indicated by the strong and stable soft component ) and whereas prominent variations of the harder component ( presumably related to compton cloud ) are present in the broad range of time - scales ( up to at least @xmath26 s ; see figs . 2 - 3 in tsa07 ) .",
    "we also confirm the observed emergent spectrum consisting of two components ( soft stable component due to the disc emission and harder highly variable component due to comptonization in the corona ) .",
    "the relative contribution of these two components to the luminosity of an averaged spectrum would then reflect the ratio of the energy releases in the disc and corona ( or mass accretion rates ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that our presented analysis indicates that the high - frequency part of the pds ( qpo and turnover ) at about 10 hz and higher is possibly related to the local instabilities operating in the comptonization region of the energy release ( see cgr99 ) .",
    "note that @xcite also pointed out the evolution of pdss in xte j15550 - 564 and xte j1650 - 500 .",
    "in particular they showed a variable power in the comptonized component ( the pds high - frequency component ) when a given source evolves from hard to soft states .",
    "however there is a difference in details between the cgr99 and results of our papers ( see also tsa07 ) .",
    "for example the break in the pds frequency range between 0.01 and 1 hz is associated with the characteristic diffusion frequencies of the compton cloud but not as that in cgr99 `` with the characteristic frequencies in the accretion flow at the thin disc truncation radius . ''",
    "@xcite , hereafter abl05 , suggested a model of the pds of cyg x-1 which successfully presented a natural transition from hard state through intermediate state to soft state and back , and also allowed them to study the behavior of the lorentzian components in detail . using this model consisting of a power - law and two lorentzian profiles ,",
    "abl05 were able to fit the cyg x-1 pdss , and to follow the components from hard state through the transitions and back . by choosing this simple empirical approach for the pds data analysis abs05 could model the major features in all states with only three components .",
    "the parameters used in abl05 were the width and peak frequency of the lorentzians , along with the power at the peak frequency , the parameter evolution and its correlation between each other can all be described by continuous functions .",
    "abl05 also showed that the pds of cyg x-1 is dominated by the same two lorentzian components at all times .",
    "they came to this conclusion based on the fact that the relation of the peak frequencies of these lorentzian components follows the pattern seen in both other bh and ns systems , and therefore they proposed that the physical processes responsible for them can not be explained by invoking magnetic fields , a solid surface , or an event horizon .",
    "it is worth noting that we also find that the diffusion ( break ) and qpo frequency follows the bh - ns pattern ( see details in st06 and tsa07 ) .",
    "in addition to this we demonstrate that there is a certain correlation between qpo low frequency and driving ( high ) frequency and photon index ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and show a correlation between the diffusion time scale ( an inverse of the diffusion frequency ) and the driving frequency ( see fig .",
    "furthermore we explain the nature of the observational appearances of the power and photon spectra evolution by the evolution of the truncated disk and corona configurations when a x - ray source evolves from hard state to soft states .",
    "we come to the conclusion that the truncated disk and corona scenario should be a common model in bh and ns systems .",
    "in fact , tlm98 showed that the bounded configuration ( compton cloud ) surrounding compact objects is the transition layer ( tl ) that is formed as a result of dynamical adjustments of a keplerian disk to the innermost sub- keplerian boundary conditions .",
    "they argued that this type of adjustment is a generic feature of the keplerian flow in the presence of the sub - keplerian boundary conditions near the central object and that it does not necessarily require the presence or absence of a hard surface .",
    "tlm98 concluded that an isothermal sub - keplerian tl between the ns surface and its last keplerian orbit forms as a result of this adjustment .",
    "the tl model is general and is applicable to both ns and bh systems .      \\1 . that we explain the decay of the emergent time variability of x - ray emission in compact sources when these sources evolve from low / hard to high / soft states .",
    "we find that the resulting power @xmath1 from cyg x-1 decays with the driving oscillation frequency @xmath2 as @xmath27 .",
    "we show that the reciprocal of the diffusion time scale of the perturbation @xmath28 , the low frequency qpo @xmath15 , the driving oscillation frequency @xmath2 , inferred by fitting the cyg x-1 pdss with our diffusion model , increase when the source evolves from low / hard state to high / soft state .",
    "this behavior of the pds characteristics implies that the compton cloud contracts towards softer spectral states .",
    "the driving oscillations are probably caused by the local rayleigh - taylor instability which cumulative @xmath3 decreases when the effective area of the configuration producing the rt oscillations contracts .",
    "the decay in driving power leads to the decay in the total observed variability power from the source . using the fact that @xmath28 , @xmath15 , @xmath2 increase with @xmath7 and @xmath3 , @xmath1 decrease with @xmath7 we conclude , as a result of our analysis , that the compton corona shrinks when cyg x-1 goes from low / hard state to high / soft state .",
    "our extensive data analysis of the power spectra from cyg x-1 with an application of the method of @xmath19number determination developed in tsa07 indicates that @xmath8 related to compton cloud configuration increases from values about 10 in low / hard state to that about 70 in high / soft state .",
    "we confirm the predictions by tlm98 that @xmath19number should increase with index and qpo frequencies .",
    "thus one can conclude that the observable index - qpo correlation is probably driven by the increase of @xmath19number when the source evolves from low / hard state to high / soft state .",
    "it is worth noting that inverse proportionality of the low - frequency qpo with respect bh mass in the index - qpo correlation leads to the method weighing bhs employing this index - qpo correlation ."
