    "the mid and far infrared ( @xmath1 10 - 1000 ) is a wavelength domain where some galaxy populations show significant changes over time ( e.g. , puget et al .",

    "2002 ; le floch et al . 2005",
    "; lagache , dole & puget 2005 ) and is therefore critical in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the strong emission of galaxies in these wavelengths has been measured for objects with very different optical properties ( spirals , ellipticals , seyferts , interacting galaxies ) .",
    "the optical to ir ratio varies strongly from galaxy to galaxy and can be as low as few percent for the extreme ir galaxies ( @xmath6 ) where the ir emission dominates their total luminosity ( rieke & lebofsky 1978 ) .",
    "this ir emission is mostly due to starlight absorbed by dust grains and re - emitted at longer wavelengths , though some objects have a significant non - thermal contribution coming from ionized gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( laurent et al .",
    "2000a ) and from active galactic nuclei and radio sources .",
    "the mid - ir light ( @xmath7 530 ) is emitted by dust grains of different sizes ( dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ) , that include very small grains ( vsg ) , which are responsible for the thermal emission at 10 - 16 @xmath5 m and are located in hii regions ( laurent et al .",
    "2000b ) , and aromatic molecules ( e.g. , pah , leger & puget 1984 ) that absorb ultra - violet photons generated in photo - dissociation regions ( pdr ) and re - emit in several bands between 3 and 17   ( e.g. , laurent et al . 2000b",
    "; lagache , puget & dole 2005 ) . at longer wavelengths the emission is due to larger grains composed mainly of silicates ( dsert et al .",
    "the latter absorb light from the ism that is generated by young ob associations and from the old disk population ( lonsdale & helou 1987 ) .",
    "the ubiquity of dust in galaxies was demonstrated by the infrared astronomical satellite ( )  survey , which covered over 90% of the sky in wavelengths ranging from 12   to 100  , and showed that most of the detected infrared luminosity could be explained by dust at temperatures of 40k and higher .",
    "however , evidence for dust at more than one temperature was first noted by helou ( 1986 ) from the @xmath8 12/25 @xmath5 m to 60/100 @xmath5 m color - color diagram which suggested that in addition to dust excited by the actively star forming regions , another component due to cooler `` cirrus '' was present and motivated the models proposed by lonsdale & helou ( 1987 ) mentioned above , and validated by sauvage & thuan ( 1992 ) in study comparing the h@xmath9 and far - ir luminosities . from the analysis of the gas to dust ratio in spiral galaxies , devereux & young ( 1990 )",
    "could explain the observed discrepancy between the gas to dust ratios measured in external galaxies with the measurements obtained for the galaxy by assuming the presence of a diffuse and cold ( t @xmath10 30k ) dust component dominant in the outer regions of galaxies , while the warmer dust would be predominant in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "the detection of this cold dust required reaching longer wavelengths than accessible with .",
    "this became possible with the flight of the infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) which allowed probing out to 200   and with the commissioning of the submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc ) at the caltech submilliter observatory ( e.g. , serabyn et al . 1999 ) and on the james clerk maxwell telescope of the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) ( holland et al .",

    "the ground based observations using scuba to target nearby galaxies with  detections also suggested the presence of significant amounts of cold dust .",

    "( 2000 ) suggested that a cold dust component would be present in their sample , but which would not be directly detected by @xmath8 . to overcome the bias of using only @xmath8-selected galaxies , vlahakis , dunne & eales ( 2005 ) used the cfa1 redshift survey ( huchra et al .",
    "1983 ) to define a sample to observe with scuba based exclusively on their optical properties .",
    "these were observed at 850 @xmath5 m as part of the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) .",
    "the slugs sample confirmed previous findings ( e.g. , tuffs & popescu 2003 ) using iso that most of the dust mass is contained in cold particles . whenever scuba data at 450 @xmath5 m were available , supplementing the 850 @xmath5 m and @xmath8 measurements , vlahakis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that two dust components ( one warm , another cold ) generally produced better fits to the observed distribution of mid- to far - ir fluxes .",
    "their fits suggested that the total cold dust mass in these galaxies could be up to 100 times larger than the dust responsible for the emission at 5 @xmath5 m through 70 @xmath5 m .",
    "our understanding of dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe has increased dramatically with the _ spitzer nearby galaxies survey _ ( sings ) key project ( kennicutt et al .",
    "sings has obtained extensive observations ranging from the far - uv observed with the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex , martin et al .",

    "( 2007 ) measurements for sings galaxies are outlined as the dotted histogram for the entire sample and the solid line histogram for the scuba sub - sample of 17 galaxies .",
    "the distribution of aromatic grain indices for slugs and the full sings is similar in spite of the small number of slugs objects .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows the distribution of @xmath50 , which quantifies the contribution due to starlight re - radiated in photo - dissociation regions relative to the idealized single and constant radiation field @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath50 distribution for slugs has a median value of @xmath1 0.6% , and the galaxies are all concentrated in a single bin in the histogram ; sings galaxies have @xmath50 @xmath1 1% .",
    "this low value of @xmath50 for slugs has direct implications for the estimate of the average starlight intensity shown in figure 7(c ) which is lower ( @xmath68 1.3 ) than what is measured for sings ( @xmath69 2.5 ) .",
    "figure 8(a ) shows the distribution of total dust masses .",
    "slugs galaxies have masses ranging from @xmath1 10@xmath70 to 10@xmath71 , with a median of 10@xmath72 , @xmath1 3 @xmath26 higher than is measured for the entire sample of sings galaxies ( 10@xmath73 ) . however , as noted by draine et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , for galaxies without sub - mm data the fitting procedure has to be more constrained otherwise the resulting fits may produce @xmath74 cold dust masses . however , draine et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the mass estimates for @xmath1 65% of their sample agree within a factor of 1.5 when fits using and discarding the sub - mm data are compared .",
    "given the uncertainties , the observed difference between slugs and sings is probably not significant , corroborated by the similar masses of sings galaxies with sub - mm data ( 10@xmath75 ) .",
    "figure 8(b ) shows the total dust luminosities , which for slugs galaxies ( @xmath76 ) are somewhat higher than for the entire sings sample ( @xmath77 ) ( though the distribution is virtually identical to that of the sings scuba subsample @xmath78 ) .",
    "differences between the distribution of the dust model parameters were examined using the two - sided kolmolgorov - smirnov test ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the only significant difference between both samples is found for the average starlight field @xmath79 where the probability of both distributions being drawn from the same parent sample is @xmath80 10@xmath81 .    on average , the slugs galaxies have a warm dust component with a median temperature of @xmath46=54.7@xmath311.7  k and a colder one with @xmath47= 18.5@xmath311.1  k. both estimates agree within 2 @xmath82 with the results of vlahakis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who find @xmath46=47.4@xmath312.4  k and @xmath47= 20.2@xmath310.5  k respectively . the warm dust temperature is comparable to that measured by hinz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for ugc  6879 , while the the average value we find for the cold dust component is comparable to the hinz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measurement for the starbursting dwarf galaxy ugc  10445 .",
    "similarly to the findings of vlahakis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and hinz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , most of the dust in these galaxies is cold , with @xmath48 @xmath1 1156@xmath31658 .",
    "the distribution of the ratio between the cold and warm dust components for slugs and sings is shown in figure 9 .",
    "although there is some overlap in the mass ratios , sings galaxies with scuba measurements tend to have a smaller contribution due to cold dust with a ratio of 538@xmath31305 .",
    "the ratio between the total emission integrated from 51000 @xmath5 m , which includes the important contribution due to aromatic emission ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "2009 ) and the infrared luminosity in the range 100 - 1000 @xmath5 m , which is mostly dominated by the cold dust component , is shown in fig .",
    "slugs galaxies are represented by the solid black circles , sings galaxies with scuba measurements by diamonds or open squares ( in the case of low significance level measurements ) ; the triangles represent sings galaxies for which the far - ir is not as well constrained because of the absence of scuba data . also shown",

    "( 2009 ) represented by stars .",
    "the slugs galaxies populate a region of lower luminosities and with a higher proportion of far - ir emission than the sample of sings galaxies with scuba measurements . however , it is interesting to note that the constrained draine & li ( 2007 ) models place many of the sings galaxies without scuba measurements in roughly the same parameter space as the slugs galaxies .",
    "the combined slugs and sings and lirg / ulirg samples show a trend where the amount of energy in the far - ir becomes more important as lower luminosities are reached .",
    "this trend is also seen in the rieke et al .",
    "( 2009 ) templates .",
    "the new observations reported in this paper suggest that there is a wider variety of sub - mm properties than encompassed by sings alone , with a larger fraction of galaxies in the nearby universe presenting significant amounts of dust at temperatures @xmath1 18 k. the luminosities of these galaxies ( log(@xmath87 ) @xmath1 10.2 ) are comparable to some of the least luminous objects detected in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey ( shades ) , a blank field survey which scanned several patches of sky ( mortier et al .",
    "2005 ) , in contrast to slugs , which targeted optically - detected galaxies .",
    "the lower luminosity galaxies in shades are characterized as having `` cirrus '' seds ( e.g. , clements et al .",
    "2008 ) and make up @xmath1 25 % of the sample of sub - mm galaxies ( clements et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that the local samples are undersampling this type of galaxy .",
    "we trace the spectral energy distribution for 11 galaxies providing an unbiased sample of sub - mm properties ( from the slugs selection ) .",
    "we combine new irac and mips data obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _ with existing 850 @xmath5 m ,   and near - ir measurements .",
    "the new measurements confirm the presence of cold ( t@xmath118k ) dust in 10 of these galaxies .",
    "using fits of draine & li ( 2007 ) models we show that the contribution due to light reprocessed by photo - dissociation regions is not as important in our sample as it is for sings galaxies .",
    "the models also suggest that the total ir emission of slugs galaxies has a small contribution due to pah lines emitted in photo - dissociation regions",
    ". however the proportion of the total light contributed by the mid - ir emission is smaller than that measured for the sings sample .",
    "the typical total dust masses obtained using draine & li ( 2007 ) models are of 10@xmath88 and dust luminosities are @xmath1 10@xmath89 .",
    "the most significant difference between the samples is the lower average intensity of the general radiation field of slugs compared to sings galaxies .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , slugs galaxies show @xmath1 2 @xmath26 larger proportion of cold dust relative to warm than do the sings galaxies .",
    "the present data combined with previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types of spirals being the major contributor to their far - infrared luminosity ( tuffs and popescu 2003 ) .",
    "although the 160 @xmath5 m data are somewhat shallow , they suggest that qualitatively the scale length distribution of cold dust is at least comparable to what is measured in the mid - infrared and in the visible ( e.g. , alton et al . 1998 ; davies et al . 1999 ; tuffs et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ; hinz et al .",
    "since the amount of dust in a galaxy measures the quantity of heavy elements in the ism , it gives a complementary measure of the average metallicity of galaxy ( dunne et al .",
    "thus the presence of cold dust suggests that the extended hi in these galaxies is generally not metal - poor . c.n.a.w .",
