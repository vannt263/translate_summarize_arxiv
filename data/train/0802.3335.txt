    "the non - trivial topology of the configuration space of the bosonic sector of the su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) electroweak theory gives rise to a plethora of unstable classical solutions .",
    "besides the klinkhamer - manton sphaleron @xcite , weinberg - salam theory also allows for multisphalerons , which possess either axial or platonic symmetries @xcite .",
    "moreover sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs are present @xcite , and , as shown recently , also sphaleron - antisphaleron chains and vortex rings @xcite .    when gravity is coupled to this yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory , the flat space sphaleron changes smoothly , and a branch of gravitating sphalerons arises @xcite .",
    "this branch bifurcates at a maximal value of the gravitational coupling constant with a second branch , higher in energy . in the limit of vanishing coupling constant",
    ", this second branch ends at the lowest bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solution @xcite of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory .",
    "here we consider the effect of gravity on the axially symmetric multisphalerons , and the sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs , chains and vortex rings .",
    "we characterize these solutions by two integers , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the klinkhamer - manton sphaleron has @xmath3 , while the multisphalerons , representing superpositions of @xmath2 sphalerons , have @xmath4 .",
    "sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs are obtained for @xmath5 , and chains for @xmath6 , while vortex rings arise for @xmath7 .",
    "we find , that all these unstable gravitating solutions show the same general coupling constant dependence , as observed for the single gravitating sphaleron .",
    "two branches of solutions arise , a lower branch connected to the flat space solution and an upper branch connected to an eym solution . for @xmath8 these eym solutions",
    "correspond to the spherically symmetric bm solution ( @xmath9 ) or their axially symmetric generalizations ( @xmath10 ) @xcite , whereas for @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) these limiting eym solutions are of a different type @xcite . at the same time",
    "additional branches of solutions arise , which connect to the generalized bm solutions @xcite .",
    "all these solutions thus show a gravity dependence , similar to the monopole - antimonopole pair , chain and vortex ring solutions @xcite , encountered in the georgi - glashow model coupled to gravity , where the higgs field is not in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) , but instead in the adjoint representation .",
    "we therefore here address the analogy of both sets of solutions .",
    "in particular , we find major agreement concerning their general pattern , when we compare sphalerons and sphaleron - antisphaleron systems , characterized by the integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with monopole - antimonopole systems , characterized by the integers @xmath13 and @xmath2 .    in section",
    "ii we briefly review the action of su(2 ) eymh theory .",
    "we present the static axially symmetric anstze and the boundary conditions for the solutions in section iii . in section",
    "iv we then present our numerical results for sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs , chains and vortex rings , and discuss the physical properties of these solutions .",
    "we give our conclusions in section v.",

    "the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under local @xmath24 gauge transformations @xmath25 , @xmath26 the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath27 leading to the vector and scalar boson masses @xmath28    in the absence of gravity , the lagrangian reduces to the bosonic sector of weinberg - salam theory with vanishing weinberg angle .",
    "setting the weinberg angle to zero is a good approximation for sphalerons and multisphalerons @xcite .",

    "to obtain gravitating static axially symmetric solutions , we employ isotropic coordinates @xcite . in terms of the spherical",
    "coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 the isotropic metric reads @xmath34 where the metric functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are functions of the coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 , only .",
    "the @xmath38-axis ( @xmath39 ) represents the symmetry axis .",
    "regularity on this axis requires @xmath40    we take a purely magnetic gauge field , @xmath41 , and parametrize the gauge potential and the higgs field by the ansatz @xcite @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 @xmath2 and @xmath1 are integers , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the pauli matrices .",

    "these axially symmetric solutions represent gravitating multisphaleron ( @xmath53 ) , sphaleron - antisphaleron pair ( @xmath54 ) , chain ( @xmath55 ) , and vortex ring ( @xmath7 ) configurations as well as mixed configurations .    with this ansatz",
    "the full set of field equations reduces to a system of nine coupled partial differential equations in the independent variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 . a residual u(1 ) gauge degree of freedom",
    "is fixed by the condition @xmath56 @xcite .",

    "we note that the gauge potential approaches a pure gauge at infinity , @xmath61 when the higgs field is in the doublet representation ( @xmath62 ) , and likewise for monopole - antimonopole systems with vanishing total magnetic charge ( @xmath63 ) , and for pure eym solutions .",
    "let us now introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath64 and the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath65 @xmath66 the limit @xmath67 can be approached in two different ways : 1 .",
    "@xmath68 , while the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath23 remains finite ( flat - space limit ) , and 2 .",
    "@xmath69 , while newton s constant @xmath20 remains finite .",
    "these limits are then associated with different branches of solutions .",
    "the dimensionless mass @xmath70 of the solutions is obtained from the asymptotic expansion of the metric function @xmath35 , @xmath71",
    "let us first briefly recall the new static axially symmetric solutions of weinberg - salam theory ( in the limit of vanishing weinberg angle ) , found recently @xcite .",
    "we here restrict the discussion to the case of vanishing higgs mass .",
    "the axially symmetric solutions are characterized by two integers , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "( we do not consider radial excitations of the solutions , associated with a third integer . )",
    "the electroweak sphaleron corresponds to the special case @xmath3 , multisphalerons are obtained for @xmath4 , while the new electroweak solutions require @xmath49 . like the electroweak sphaleron the new solutions are unstable , corresponding to saddle points .    for @xmath72 ,",
    "the modulus of the higgs field of these solutions vanishes on @xmath1 discrete points on the symmetry axis , thus these flat space solutions correspond to sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs and chains .",
    "for @xmath73 the solutions change character , and the modulus of the higgs field vanishes on one or more rings centered around the symmetry axis . while @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent a transitional regime , where ( two or more ) isolated nodes on the symmetry axis and rings coexist , for larger values of @xmath2 these solutions possess @xmath76 $ ] vortex rings ( where @xmath76 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath77 ) . for even @xmath1 , these solutions",
    "are thus pure electroweak vortex ring solutions , while for odd @xmath1 these solutions represent electroweak sphaleron - vortex ring superpositions , since here an isolated node at the origin is retained .",
    "let us now consider the coupling to gravity , while restricting to vanishing higgs coupling constant , @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] we exhibit the scaled mass @xmath79 of the single sphaleron ( @xmath3 ) and the multisphalerons ( @xmath80 ) versus the coupling constant @xmath65 . whereas the mass @xmath70 is finite in the flat space limit @xmath81 , the scaled mass @xmath82 vanishes there .    in each case , a lower branch of gravitating sphalerons resp .",
    "multisphalerons emerges from the corresponding flat space solution at @xmath81 , and extends up to a maximal value of the coupling constant , @xmath83 , beyond which no such globally regular solutions exist . at @xmath83",
    "the lower branch merges with a second branch , the upper branch , which extends back to @xmath84 .",
    "the mass @xmath70 diverges on the upper branch in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "the scaled mass @xmath79 , in contrast , assumes a finite limiting value . rescaling the solutions then shows , that in the limit @xmath84 in each case a globally regular eym solution is reached , corresponding to the first bm solution ( @xmath9 ) or a generalized bm solution ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "( note , that the @xmath9 gravitating sphaleron was studied before @xcite . )     [ f-1 ]    considering the sets of solutions for different values of @xmath2 , we note , that with increasing @xmath2 the maximal value of the coupling constant @xmath83 decreases monotonically . at the same time",
    "the maximal value of the scaled mass increases monotonically and almost linearly .",
    "we now compare these gravitating sphaleron and multisphaleron solutions with gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair and vortex ring solutions @xcite . in these solutions",
    "the higgs field is in the triplet representation , thus providing only two of the gauge bosons with mass , while the third remains massless and is therefore associated with the electromagnetic field .",
    "the monopole - antimonopole pair and vortex ring solutions with @xmath85 are magnetically neutral , but possess magnetic dipole moments , just like the sphaleron solutions at finite weinberg angle @xcite .",
    "the figure shows , that the monopole - antimonopole pair and vortex ring solutions with @xmath85 exhibit precisely the same pattern as the sphaleron and multisphalerons solutions with @xmath86 , when their dependence on the coupling constant @xmath65 and the integer @xmath2 is considered .",
    "interestingly , for the case @xmath87 , the agreement of the scaled mass is excellent on both branches of solutions , which therefore almost coincide . whether this is accidental , or whether there is a hidden reason for this remarkable agreement is not clear at the moment , though .",
    "let us next consider larger values of @xmath1 , i.e. , consider the dependence of sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs and vortex rings on the coupling constant @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] we exhibit the scaled mass @xmath79 of the gravitating sphaleron ( @xmath3 ) together with the scaled mass of the gravitating sphaleron - antisphaleron pair ( @xmath54 ) and chain ( @xmath88 ) versus the coupling constant @xmath65 . again , the mass @xmath70 is finite in the flat space limit @xmath81 , while the scaled mass @xmath82 vanishes there .",
    "[ f-2 ]    also for the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair ( @xmath85 ) and chain ( @xmath89 ) a lower branch of gravitating solutions emerges from the corresponding flat space solution at @xmath81 , and extends up to a maximal value of the coupling constant , @xmath83 , where it merges with a second branch , the upper branch , which extends back to @xmath84 . in the limit @xmath84",
    ", the scaled mass @xmath79 assumes the same finite limiting value for the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair and chain as for the single sphaleron .",
    "clearly , in all cases ( after rescaling ) the first bm solution ( @xmath9 ) is reached @xcite .",
    "associating again these gravitating sphaleron - antisphaleron solutions with the corresponding gravitating monopole - antimonopole systems , we must resort to @xmath90 and @xmath91 monopole - antimonopole chains , respectively .",
    "this is clear , because we already associated a monopole - antimonopole pair with a single sphaleron .",
    "thus we must associate two monopole - antimonopole pairs with the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair , and three with the sphaleron - antisphaleron ( @xmath89 ) chain .",
    "these then represent monopole - antimonopole chains composed of @xmath90 and @xmath91 constituents , respectively , i.e.  @xmath1 monopoles and antimonopoles , alternating on the symmetry axis .",
    "the figure again reveals , that the monopole - antimonopole chains with @xmath90 and @xmath91 exhibit precisely the same pattern as the sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs ( @xmath85 ) and chains ( @xmath89 ) , respectively , when their dependence on the coupling constant @xmath65 is considered . in general ,",
    "we conclude , that sphaleron - antispaleron chains with @xmath1 constituents , can be associated with monopole - antimonopole chains , composed of @xmath13 constituents .",
    "let us finally consider gravitating sphaleron - antisphaleron vortex rings for @xmath85 and @xmath87 . in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ] we exhibit for these solutions the scaled mass @xmath79 versus the coupling constant @xmath65 , together with the scaled mass of the gravitating multisphalerons ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) . for these gravitating sphaleron - antisphaleron vortex",
    "rings we observe four instead of two branches of solutions . as before the lower flat space branch ends and merges with the upper branch at @xmath83 . the upper branch , however",
    ", does not connect to the generalized bm solution in the limit @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "instead it reaches an eym solution of a different type , which exists only when @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "[ f-3 ]    since eym solutions of this type always come in pairs for a given set of integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a second @xmath87 eym solution is present , which is slightly higher in mass @xcite .",
    "this second eym solution constitutes the endpoint of a second upper branch of sphaleron - antisphaleron solutions , which merges at a second critical value of the coupling constant @xmath94 with a second lower branch , and it is along this second lower branch , that in the limit @xmath84 the solutions connect to the generalized bm solution with @xmath87 .",
    "we now compare these gravitating @xmath85 sphaleron - antisphaleron vortex ring solutions again with the corresponding gravitating @xmath90 monopole - antimonopole vortex ring solutions .",
    "as anticipated , the figure reveals , that the monopole - antimonopole vortex rings with @xmath90 exhibit precisely the same pattern as the sphaleron - antisphaleron vortex rings with @xmath85 , when their dependence on the coupling constant @xmath65 is considered .",
    "moreover , the masses show again an intriguing quantitative agreement for these @xmath87 solutions , which remains to be understood .",
    "the sphaleron - antisphaleron chain and vortex ring configurations presented above were all obtained for vanishing higgs mass , as a function of the higgs mass these solutions also form branches @xcite . at critical values of the higgs mass bifurcations arise , where new branches of solutions appear .",
    "these then give rise to a plethora of further gravitating solutions to be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we have investigated gravitating sphalerons , multisphalerons and sphaleron - antisphaleron systems , which are static and axially symmetric , and characterized by two integers , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "single sphalerons are obtained for @xmath3 , multisphalerons for @xmath86 and @xmath10 , and sphaleron - antisphaleron systems for @xmath49 . like the electroweak sphaleron these new solutions are unstable , corresponding to saddle points .    in the presence of gravity , from each of these flat space solutions ,",
    "a branch of gravitating solutions emerges and evolves smoothly with increasing gravitational coupling constant @xmath65 up to a maximal value @xmath83 .",
    "there it merges with a second branch , higher in energy , which extends backwards to @xmath81 . in the limit ,",
    "the higgs vacuum expectation value vanishes , and the limiting solutions correspond to pure eym solutions ( after rescaling ) .    for larger values of the higgs mass ,",
    "the flat space solutions are no longer uniquely specified by the integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "instead bifurcations appear , giving rise to further branches and types of configurations . as for the monopole - antimonopole systems @xcite",
    ", we therefore expect a plethora of gravitating solutions at large scalar coupling .",
    "furthermore , for very large values of the higgs mass also bisphalerons or ` deformed ' sphalerons are present @xcite , which do not exhibit parity reflection symmetry .    comparing these gravitating sphaleron , multisphaleron and sphaleron - antisphaleron solutions , based on a doublet higgs field , with the monopole - antimonopole solutions , obtained with a triplet higgs field , we find precisely the same pattern of branches of solutions , when we compare sphalerons and sphaleron - antisphaleron systems characterized by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with monopole - antimonopole systems characterized by @xmath13 and @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , in the case @xmath87 , the scaled mass of both types of solutions even almost coincides .",
    "monopole - antimonopole systems can rotate , when they carry no magnetic charge @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears interesting to consider also rotating sphaleron - antisphaleron systems .",
    "moreover , monopole - antimonopole systems can be endowed with a black hole at their center , as shown explicitly already for the monopole - antimonopole pair @xcite .",
    "sphaleron - antisphaleron systems with black holes are thus expected to exist as well .",
