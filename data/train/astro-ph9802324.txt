    "in the last 25 years more than 40 accretion - powered x - ray pulsars have been detected .",

    "these outbursts are sometimes associated with `` giant '' outbursts accompanied by high spin - up rates and luminosities .",
    "batse observed four additional accreting x - ray pulsars , without identified companions , which are believed to also be be / x - ray binaries because their temporal behavior closely resembles that of systems with be companions ( @xcite ) . this paper reports the discovery and temporal behavior of the fourth member of this group , gro j2058 + 42 .",

    "short intervals of data ( 200 s ) were fit with a background model plus a sixth order fourier expansion in the pulsed phase model to generate pulse profiles at the model frequency .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed description of pulsed flux and pulsed frequency estimation techniques . )",
    "the pulsed phase model initially consisted of a constant frequency obtained from daily power spectra of the batse discla data .",
    "the data were combined into 600 second intervals with continuous background models . for each four day span , the pulse profiles from the 600 s intervals were shifted in phase according to a range of trial frequency offsets from the pulse phase model ( @xmath4 5 cycles day@xmath5 ) . then the profiles were summed for each trial frequency offset .",
    "the best fit frequency was determined by the z@xmath6 test ( @xcite ) which measured the significance of the first 6 fourier amplitudes .",
    "the frequency estimates were iteratively improved by generating a new phase model from the best fit frequencies and repeating the process . for gro j2058 + 42 , root - mean - square ( rms )",

    "longer than about 100 seconds , this frequency estimation method had an added complication if the pulse period was close to a harmonic of the spacecraft orbital period ( @xmath15 93 min ) .",
    "the pulse period of gro j2058 + 42 was close the 28th spacecraft orbital harmonic .",
    "relatively bright sources produced intensity steps in the count rate in source - facing detectors upon entering or exiting earth occultation .",
    "when the data from these detectors were fit for a range of frequencies that included a spacecraft orbital harmonic , the accumulated occultation steps produced a periodic signal which was sometimes more significant than the signal from gro j2058 + 42 .",
    "this effect was removed by discarding an interval of about 30 seconds of discla data which was centered on the occultation step of each interfering source and by allowing a corresponding discontinuity in the background model .",
    "occultations for the crab and cyg x-1 were always removed from the data .",

    "[ fig : freqhis ] , which shows the determined pulse frequency and pulsed flux history of gro j2058 + 42 from batse data , it is apparent that gro j2058 + 42 experienced a large spin up during its initial 46 day outburst .",

    "measurements of the spin - up rate yielded a peak value of @xmath17 hz s@xmath5 ( where we have neglected corrections for the pulsar s orbital motion ) , which is comparable to peak spin - up rates seen by batse in `` giant '' outbursts from known be transients ( @xcite ) . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : freqhis ] ,",
    "the peak intensity of the initial outburst is about 10 times the peak intensity of later outbursts .",
    "the initial outburst begins at approximately the same orbital phase as later outbursts , but peaks at a later phase .",
    "the large spin - up and brightness of the initial outburst compared to later outbursts leads us to classify it as a `` giant '' outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total ( pulsed+unpulsed ) flux from gro j2058 + 42 was determined using earth occultation measurements .",
    "this technique measures the intensity of a known source by calculating the difference in total count rate in source - facing detectors just before and just after occultation by the earth ( @xcite ) . for sources with long pulse periods and large pulsed fractions , flux measurements from individual occultation edges",
    "can be biased by favoring a particular pulse phase . however ,",
    "this bias was easily eliminated by averaging many occultation measurements to uniformly sample the pulse .",
    "both the earth occultation measurements and the pulsed flux measurements were well fit by an exponential spectrum ( see eq .",

    "no dependence of spectral shape on intensity was detected .",
    "the total 20 - 70 kev flux history for gro j2058 + 42 was determined at 2-day intervals by fitting the earth occultation count rates with equation  ( [ eqn : spec ] ) and assuming @xmath18 kev .",

    "gamma - ray bursts , solar flares , south atlantic anomaly passages , and electron precipitation events in the data stream were also excluded .",
    "we searched for pulse shape variations using a statistical comparison of pulse profiles formulated in the frequency domain .",
    "wilson et al . ( 1997 ) show that the harmonic coefficients of a pulse profile are uncorrelated . for each single spacecraft orbit",

    "we calculated the mean value @xmath27 from the measurements of @xmath28 from the epoch - folded profiles contained within each 4-day interval corresponding to the phase model .",
    "we calculated the error on the mean @xmath29 from the sample variance of the measurements of @xmath28 . by comparing signal power to noise power @xmath30",
    ", we determined that only the first 6 harmonics were significant .",
    "the average noise level was higher than expected for poisson counting noise because cyg x-1 was nearly always present in the field of view and was in an active state during the giant outburst of gro j2058 + 42 , introducing spurious noise power over a broad range of frequencies .",
    "the observed noise power spectrum exhibited a turnover frequency consistent with cyg x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "noise from cyg x-1 also affected the sensitivity of the frequency search .",
    "we attempted to remove cyg x-1 in the time domain by simultaneously fitting the two sources using different assumed spectra . for each phase bin , fluxes were determined for gro j2058 + 42 and cyg x-1 by minimizing @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean subtracted count rate for the @xmath33th energy channel in a 4-day mean profile , @xmath34 is the gro j2058 + 42 flux at 30 kev , and @xmath35 is the cyg x-1 flux at 30 kev .",

    "the parameter @xmath40 was calculated in the same way using a photon power law spectrum with photon index -1.85 for cyg x-1 .",
    "the energy channel range used corresponded to 20 - 125 kev .",
    "gro 2058 + 42 was detectable up to about 70 kev while cyg x-1 emission was present up to about 400 kev .",
    "this method worked well for only the brightest profiles , due to statistical limitations .",
    "figure  [ fig : cyg ] shows the fit to a profile from 1995",
    "september 23 - 27 near the peak of the giant outburst .",
    "noise from cyg x-1 appears to be causing high frequency features in the profile .",
    "since noise from cyg x-1 could not be directly removed , only the first 6 harmonics of the pulse profiles were retained for pulse shape analysis , thus avoiding most of the noise effects .",
    "groups of harmonic limited 4-day profiles were phase - aligned and averaged to improve statistical significance .",
    "mean profiles from different epochs were compared by minimizing @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 were the harmonic coefficients of the first and second mean profiles respectively and @xmath44 and @xmath45 were the corresponding errors .",
    "the second mean profile was scaled by a factor @xmath46 and shifted in phase by @xmath47 to obtain the best fit .",
    "phase aligned pulse profiles were thus constructed from batse 20 - 70 kev cont data from four intervals : ( a)1995 september 11 - 18,(b ) september 23 - 30 , ( c ) october 5 - 17 , and ( d ) october 17 - 28 .",
    "the intensity intervals used to construct these profiles are denoted by dotted lines in figure  [ fig : occhis ] and are labeled accordingly .",
    "the profiles themselves are shown in figure  [ fig : profile ] .",
    "average count rates measured by earth occultation for these time intervals were added to the profiles shown to demonstrate the relative intensities of the profiles .",
    "errors on these count rates were not included in the errors plotted because the profile comparisons involved only the mean subtracted profiles .",
    "the peak - to - peak pulse fraction , @xmath48 , for these profiles was consistent with a constant value of 0.46@xmath4 0.02 .",
    "the profiles near the peak of the outburst ( figure  [ fig : profile]b ) were significantly different from profiles at lower intensities ( @xmath49 100 mcrab ) .",
    "the main pulse appeared to evolve from a faster rise than fall to a slower rise than fall , although the primary differences in the profiles were occurring in the region between the large pulses ( phase 0.5 - 1 ) .",
    "profile ( a ) was relatively flat in the interpulse region .",
    "the deep dip near phase 0.6 persisted in higher channels and was most likely due to cyg x-1 .",
    "profile ( b ) slowly declined in intensity to a minimum near phase 0.7 , after which it slowly increased in intensity .",
    "profiles ( c ) and ( d ) both had a feature from phase 0.8 - 1.0 that did not persist at higher energies , so it was most likely intrinsic to the source .",
    "the profile in ( a ) was significantly different from the profile in ( d ) , although the intensities were similar .",
    "however , profiles ( c ) and ( d ) , both from the fall of the outburst were consistent with one another , although their intensities differed .",
    "profiles during the rise of the outburst differed from those in the fall of the outburst which implies that the shape of the profile was dependent upon more than simply the mass accretion rate .",
    "next we compared profiles for the energy intervals 20 - 40 kev and 40 - 70 kev .",
    "we detected profile variations with energy as shown in figure  [ fig : hardness ] .",
    "the profiles shown are from the brightest interval 1995 september 23 - 30",
    ". comparisons from fainter intervals were also suggestive of energy dependent pulse shape variations . in figure",
    "[ fig : hardness ] , average count rates and errors from earth occultation measurements were added to the profiles .",
    "the bottom panel is the hardness ratio given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average count rate measured by earth occultation for 40 - 70 kev , @xmath52 is the mean subtracted pulse profile count rate for 40 - 70 kev , @xmath53 is the average count rate for 20 - 40 kev , and @xmath54 is the mean subtracted profile for 20 - 40 kev .",
    "the errors shown are the errors on the difference @xmath55 , since we are interested in where the hardness ratio deviated from the mean value , 0.74 @xmath4 0.06 .",
    "the hardness ratio demonstrated that the rise of the pulse ( phase 0.0 - 0.25 ) had a harder spectrum than later pulse phases .      the proportional counter array ( pca ) on _ rxte _ consists of five proportional counters sensitive to photons from 2 - 60 kev and has a total collecting area of 6500 @xmath3 .",
    "the pca is a collimated instrument with an approximately circular collimator efficiency with a fwhm of about 1  ( @xcite ) .",
    "pca observations of gro j2058 + 42 were performed on 1996 november 28 .",
    "a series of scanning observations was followed by a short ( @xmath56 ) dwell on the source .",
    "a frequency consistent with the batse barycentered measurement , @xmath57 hz at mjd 10416 , and three higher harmonics were clearly detected during the pointed observation .",
    "figure  [ fig : xte_profiles ] shows the pulse profiles as a function of energy from the pca data .",
    "the pulse shape appears to be changing with energy .",
    "evidence of variations can be seen by comparing the feature near phase 0.6 in different energy ranges .",
    "this feature is quite prominent at lower energies but is essentially nonexistent above 20 kev .",
    "to estimate the position of gro j2058 + 42 from the pca scanning data , we analyzed the two largest scan peaks simultaneously .",
    "the relatively constant background during this time greatly simplified the analysis .",
    "we used the spacecraft pointing data combined with a model of the collimator response to calculate the contribution to the total 2 - 60 kev count rate from a constant ( in time ) background @xmath58 and a model source of assumed constant intensity @xmath34 ( counts s@xmath5 ) located at celestial coordinates @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we minimized the four parameter function @xmath61 here @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the observed and predicted count rates for time interval @xmath33 , and @xmath64 is the variance on the predicted count rate .",
    "the best - fit source position was that which had the minimum value for @xmath65 .",
    "we determined a statistical confidence region from the appropriate value of @xmath66 for the 3 interesting parameters ( @xmath67 . ) to the extent that the background was flat the background parameter was not relevant to the determination of the confidence region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : pca_mod ] the data and best - fit model .",
    "the resulting best - fit position was @xmath68 , @xmath60 = 4143   ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total uncertainty in the position was not dominated by the statistical error , rather , time variability of the source as well as uncertainties in the collimator model contributed to the error budget as well .",
    "our current understanding of these effects yielded a final circular confidence region ( 90 % ) of radius 4  centered at the above position .",

    "the asm provides 90 second snapshots of most of the sky every 96 minutes in three energy channels from 2 - 12 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "archival and new image data at the position of gro j2058 + 42 determined by the pca were searched by the _ rxte _ asm team and weak outbursts were detected .",

    "the batse data indicated significant detections every @xmath15110 days of outbursts peaking at 15 - 20 mcrab ( 20 - 50 kev ) .",
    "halfway between these outbursts batse detected shorter weaker outbursts with peak fluxes @xmath69 15 mcrab .",

    "the folding epoch was chosen near the peak of a stronger outburst in the batse data .",
    "the outbursts near phase 0.0 were much brighter in the batse data than those near phase 0.5 , while both outbursts were similar in the asm data .",
    "no known systematic effects would remove or weaken outbursts in the batse data at 55 day intervals .",
    "a closer analysis of the individual _ rxte _ asm energy channels did not show a significant difference in the spectral hardness of the two sets of outbursts within the 2 - 12 kev band .",
    "the optically identified companions for transient pulsars with pulse periods longer than one second are all be or oe stars .",
    "long term studies of these be / x - ray binaries have demonstrated that giant outbursts followed by or interspersed with a series of periodic normal outbursts appear to be typical behavior for be / x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "gro j2058 + 42 is most likely a be / x - ray pulsar because it exhibits transient outbursts recurring with a presumed orbital period of 110 days and it has both giant and normal outbursts .",
    "an orbital period of 110 days places gro j2058 + 42 along the orbital period spin period correlation for be / x - ray binaries ( @xcite , @xcite . )",
    "the giant outburst of gro j2058 + 42 showed enough dynamic range that we can use the relationship between torque and observed flux to test accretion theory .",
    "simple accretion theory assumes that material from the companion star is flowing onto a rotating neutron star with a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is so strong that it determines the motion of the material in a region of space surrounding the neutron star called the magnetosphere .",
    "the size of this region , the magnetospheric radius @xmath70 , is defined to be the distance from the neutron star at which all magnetic field lines are just closed loops .",
    "another important length scale is the corotation radius , @xmath71 , the distance from the neutron star where centrifugal forces just balance local gravity .",
    "if @xmath72 , accretion is not expected to occur .",
    "accretion theory predicts @xmath73 for @xmath74 for for disk or wind accretion .",
    "the accretion torque @xmath35 is given by @xmath75 .",
    "we can assume the bolometric flux @xmath76 is related to the mass accretion rate @xmath77 by @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , simple accretion theory predicts @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the spin - up rate of the neutron star ( @xcite and references therein ) .    figure  [ fig : flvsfd ] shows the observed 20 - 100 kev flux as measured by earth occultation plotted versus the measured frequency derivative @xmath80 during the giant outburst .",
    "the frequency derivatives were generated by an search performed on the batse discla 20 - 50 kev data over a grid of trial frequencies and frequency derivatives .",
    "this technique was identical to that described in section  [ sec : giant ] except that the pulse profiles were shifted according to a grid of frequency offsets and frequency derivatives , rather than only frequency offsets .",
    "the search yielded maximum spin - up rates of 5 @xmath81 hz s@xmath5 in the weak outbursts .",
    "if we assume that the orbital contribution was small compared to the intrinsic @xmath80 , we can treat the measured @xmath80 as equal to the intrinsic @xmath80 and compare it to the total flux in the batse energy range . clearly , @xmath80 and the total flux were correlated , hence an accretion disk was likely to be present .",
    "the power law @xmath82 with @xmath83 , which is predicted by accretion torque theory , is shown in figure  [ fig : flvsfd ] .",
    "also shown is the best fit curve with @xmath84 .",
    "orbital contributions to the torque and the fact that batse does not measure the bolometric flux may explain the discrepancy between the measured slope and accretion theory .",
    "interestingly , a similar fit to exosat data from the 1985 giant outburst of the be / x - ray binary exo 2030 + 375 also gave @xmath84 ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to testing accretion theory , we can use the maximum @xmath80 ( @xmath85 hz s@xmath5 ) from the giant outburst to estimate a distance to gro j2058 + 42 .",
    "the luminosity is related to @xmath80 by @xmath86 where the notation is @xmath87 g @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 cm , @xmath91 g @xmath3 , and @xmath92 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "the neutron star has magnetic moment @xmath93 , radius r , mass m@xmath94 , moment of inertia i , accretion luminosity l@xmath95 , and ",
    "dimensionless torque \" @xmath96 .",
    "we assumed the very slow rotator case of @xmath97 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we used typical values ( m = 1.4 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) .",
    "since @xmath100 is less well known , we calculated bolometric luminosities , l@xmath101 ergs s@xmath5 , for the range @xmath102 .",
    "these luminosities were comparable to the eddington limit for neutron stars , l@xmath103 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "next , to calculate the distance , we can use the 20 - 100 kev flux corresponding to @xmath104 , @xmath105 ergs @xmath106 s@xmath5 .",
    "lastly , we must calculate a bolometric correction @xmath59 , the ratio between the batse flux and the total 2 - 100 kev flux .",
    "simultaneous batse and _ rxte _ measurements from 1996 november yielded a bolometric correction of @xmath107 .",
    "then the distance @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 which gives distances of 7 - 16 kpc for gro j2058 + 42 . for these distances",
    "the estimated bolometric luminosity for the 1996 november outburst is l@xmath110 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "bolometric luminosities for the intermediate weaker outbursts ( in the batse data ) appear to be similar to the 1996 november outburst , but are more uncertain because complete spectral and pulsed fraction information are unavailable .",
    "the weak outbursts provide interesting , but difficult to interpret , information about this system .",
    "the batse data indicate brighter and longer outbursts every @xmath15110 days with weaker outbursts in between , while the asm data show outbursts every 54 days that are similar in intensity and duration ( fig  [ fig : xte ] & @xcite ) .",
    "the intermediate weaker outbursts in the batse data must be of a different character than the stronger outbursts . the fact that batse detects a 110 day periodicity and _ rxte _ detects a periodicity at half",
    "that period implies that either a spectral change or a change in the pulse fraction is occurring every other outburst , indicating a difference in accretion mode .",
    "an analysis of the three _ rxte _ asm energy bands shows that both sets of outbursts have comparable intensity in the 5 - 12 kev band .",
    "this implies that if a spectral change is occurring it is above 12 kev .",
    "the observed periodicity may be interpreted in two ways : ( 1 ) the 110 day cycle observed in the batse data is the orbital period and 2 outbursts are occurring each orbit ; or ( 2 ) the orbital period is 54 days and the spectrum ( or pulse fraction ) alternates every other orbit for at least 9 orbits .",
    "we can find no plausible explanation for an alternating change in spectrum or pulse fraction that persists for at least 9 orbits if the outbursts are produced by periastron passage in a 54 day orbit .",
    "therefore we interpret the observed 110 day periodicity as the orbital period .",
    "we propose that gro j2058 + 42 is undergoing periastron and apastron outbursts in a 110 day orbit .",
    "a neutron star in an inclined orbit combined with concentration of material in the equatorial plane of the be star is a possible explanation for the outburst behavior observed in gro j2058 + 42 .",
    "the same velocity kicks that produce an eccentric orbit could also produce an inclined orbit .",
    "outbursts would occur twice per orbit when the neutron star crosses the equatorial plane of the companion ( @xcite ) . from the batse data",
    ", we measured the separation between the brighter outbursts to be 110 @xmath4 3 days and the separation between brighter and weaker outbursts to be @xmath111 2.3 days .",
    "if we assume the separation between the brighter outbursts is the orbital period , @xmath112 , then @xmath113 falls in the 95% confidence interval @xmath114 . for this interval",
    "the separation between periastron and the line where the neutron star s orbit intersects the equatorial plane of the companion is @xmath115 12.1  for a typical eccentricity , @xmath116 .",
    "hence this mechanism would produce outbursts near periastron and near apastron .",
    "this mechanism does not , however , explain the intensity differences seen only in the higher energies ( 20 - 50 kev ) .",
    "although an inclined orbit has often been proposed as a mechanism for outbursts in be / x - ray binaries , two outbursts per orbit have not been seen in other be / x - ray binaries to date .",
    "however , such behavior has been observed in wind - fed systems such as gx 301 - 2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "another explanation which does not require an inclined orbit suggests that two different accretion mechanisms could be at work in this system .",
    "an accretion disk is likely to be present during giant outbursts .",
    "its presence helps to explain the large and steady spin - up rates seen during giant outbursts .",
    "a peak spin - up rate of 2.5 @xmath117 hz s@xmath5 was observed in gro j2058 + 42 .",
    "bildsten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that an accretion disk could remain after a giant outburst",
    ". then normal outbursts could be produced by large tidal torques on the accretion disk during periastron passage .",
    "this could explain the series of normal outbursts following the giant outburst .",
    "the apastron outbursts could be produced by accretion from the equatorial outflow from the be star .",
    "a slow dense outflow could produce outbursts at apastron ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two outbursts per orbit would be produced by different accretion mechanisms which could produce differences in spectra or in pulse fraction . clearly , additional observations are needed to fully understand this source .",
