    "aggregation of motile organisms is an example of ecological spatial self - organization due to direct or indirect interactions between individuals @xcite . many organisms ( cells , birds , mammals ) have the ability to sense a population density which leads to density - dependent dispersal @xcite .",
    "this dependence can be explained by various mechanisms including ( i ) competition that forces an individual to emigrate ( positive density - dependence ) , ( ii ) avoidance of crowded areas by individuals ( positive density - dependence ) , ( iii ) social crowding effects when certain areas are attractive to many conspecifics ( negative density - dependence ) erik .",
    "density - dependent dispersal can be regarded as a behavioral response in which an individual changes its rate of jump due to sensing the mean population density @xcite . to model the density - dependent dispersal and aggregation , various nonlinear _ _  _ _ local and non - local advection - diffusion equations have been used in the literature turchin , pe , mai , men3,cates , kopel . some living organisms like amoeboid microorganism _",
    "dictyostelium discoideum _ can interact indirectly .",
    "they secrete a diffusible attractant ( signalling molecules ) to which individuals respond chemotactically .",
    "they move towards regions of high concentration of attractant and aggregate into a mound . on the population level ,",
    "the standard model for chemical interaction of species is a pair of the advection - diffusion - reaction equations for the average population density and concentration of signalling molecules .",
    "there is a huge body of literature on chemotactic aggregation modeling ( see , for example , sad2,eo , hp , erban , brenner , the ) .",
    "the microscopic theory of actively moving organisms is based on various random walk models @xcite .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the continuous time random walk ( position jump walk ) is the escape rate @xmath0 from the point @xmath1 for density - dependent dispersal models involving direct interaction between individuals this rate depends on the population density @xcite .",
    "indirect interaction can be modeled by the dependence of @xmath2 on concentration of signalling molecules produced by individuals @xcite .",
    "an important feature of such random walk models is that they are markovian .",
    "however , many transport processes are non - markovian for which the transport operators are non - local in time .",
    "examples include the lvy walk that may accelerate aggregation kopel2 , slow subdiffusive transport that may lead to the phenomenon of anomalous aggregation @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to take into account both nonlinear density - dependent dispersal and non - markovian anomalous behavior @xcite . although some research has been done to address the interplay between nonlinearity and non - markovian effects fed2 , it is still an open problem .    in this paper",
    "we consider a nonlinear and non - markovian random walk and propose an alternative mechanism of aggregation which we call the regime of _ self - organized anomaly _",
    "it leads to the collapse of a standard stationary aggregation pattern and development of non - stationary anomalous aggregation . by using monte carlo simulations",
    "we show that under certain conditions particles performing a non - markovian random walk with crowding effects aggregate inside a tiny domain ( anomalous aggregation ) .",
    "important fact is that this anomalous regime is self - organized and arises spontaneously without the need for a heavy tailed waiting time distribution with an infinite mean time from the inception .",
    "in this section we formulate our nonlinear and non - markovian continuous time random walk model . instead of the waiting time probability density function ( pdf )",
    "we use the escape rate @xmath3 that depends on the residence time @xmath4 and the density of particles @xmath5 due to the dependence of the rate @xmath2 on the residence time @xmath6 our model is non - markovian and should involve memory effects . our intention is to take into account nonlinear social crowding effects and non - markovian negative aging .",
    "we assume that the random walker has the ability to sense the population density @xmath7 .",
    "we model the escape rate @xmath2 as a decreasing function of the density @xmath8 @xcite @xmath9where @xmath10 is a positive parameter .",
    "this nonlinear function describes the phenomenon of conspecific attraction : the rate at which individuals emigrate from the point @xmath11 is reduced due to the presence of many conspecifics .",
    "this negative density - dependence can be explained by the various benefits of social aggregation like mating , anti - predator aggregation , etc . @xcite .",
    "the rate parameter @xmath12 is a decreasing function of the residence time ( negative aging ) : @xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive parameters .",
    "this particular choice of the rate parameter @xmath12 has been motivated by non - markovian crowding : the longer the living organisms stay in a particular site , the smaller becomes the escape probability to another site .",
