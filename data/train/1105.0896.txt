    "the leading scenario for the formation of the galaxy envisages the accretion of smaller galaxies , disrupted and accreted over time ( searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "this originally largely qualitative scenario has received considerable support from simulations carried out within the framework of the @xmath1cdm cosmological paradigm , which clearly predict that large galaxies such as the milky way are formed in a hierarchical fashion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario ,",
    "dense , massive globular clusters could survive the accretion proccess ( e.g. , forbes & bridges 2010 ) . the existence of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and stream ( ibata et al . 1994 ) , which is clear evidence of ongoing accretion , gives support to this scenario .    in this sense ,",
    "another possible case of a dwarf galaxy being accreted by the milky way is provided by the canis major overdensity ( martin et al .",
    "2004 ) , which may be related to the monoceros stream . in this case , it has been matter of considerable debate whether the cma system represents a true extragalactic system or rather an extension of the warp of the outer galactic disk .",

    "one way to shed light on the possibility of an old star cluster being associated with an accreted dwarf galaxy may be provided by the so - called oosterhoff ( 1939 ) dichotomy .",
    "this is a very interesting property of the rr lyrae population in galactic globular clusters , which divide into two classes according to their ab - type rr lyrae pulsation properties : oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) , with @xmath2  d , and oosterhoff type ii ( ooii ) , with @xmath3  d. the period range between 0.58  d and 0.62  d is poorly populated , and has been called the `` oosterhoff gap '' ( catelan 2004 ) .",
    "field stars in the milky way halo also seem to display the oosterhoff dichotomy ( e.g. , miceli et al .",
    "2008 ; szczygiel et al .",
    "intriguingly , the oosterhoff dichotomy is observed only in the milky way : nearby extragalactic systems show instead a single - peaked @xmath4 distribution , with the peak located inside the oosterhoff gap .",
    "thus , extragalactic systems are predominantly _ oosterhoff - intermediate _ , and therefore an oosterhoff - intermediate classification for a globular cluster may provide a hint of a possible extragalactic origin ( see catelan 2006 , 2009 for recent reviews and additional discussion ) .",
