    "consider a parabolic quasi - variational inequality ( qvi for short ) of the following form : @xmath0 = 0 , & \\quad on $ [ 0,t)\\times\\mathbb{r}^d$,\\cr v(t,\\cdot ) = g , & \\quad on $ \\mathbb{r}^d$ , } % \\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the second - order local operator @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the nonlocal operator @xmath4.\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the partial gradient and the hessian matrix of @xmath7 with respect to its second variable @xmath8 , respectively ; @xmath9 stands for the transpose ; @xmath10 denotes the scalar product in @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the set of all symmetric @xmath13 matrices ; and @xmath14 is some compact subset of @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the qvi ( [ iqv ] ) is the dynamic programming equation associated to the impulse control problems whose value function is defined by @xmath16.\\hspace*{-33pt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] more precisely , given a filtered probability space @xmath17 where @xmath18 , we define an impulse control @xmath19 as a double sequence @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is an increasing sequence of @xmath22-stopping times , and each @xmath23 is an @xmath24-measurable random variable taking values in @xmath14 . for each impulse control @xmath25 ,",
    "the controlled dynamics starting from @xmath8 at time @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath27 , is a cdlg process satisfying the following sde : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a @xmath30-dimensional @xmath22-brownian motion .",
    "in other words , the controlled process @xmath27 evolves according to a diffusion process between two successive intervention times @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and at each decided intervention time @xmath31 , the process jumps with size @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the impulse control problem ( [ impulse ] ) may be viewed as a sequence of optimal stopping problems combined with jumps in state due to impulse values . moreover , the qvi ( [ iqv ] ) is the infinitesimal derivation of the dynamic programming principle , which means that at each time , the controller may decide either to do nothing and let the state process diffuse , or to make an intervention on the system via some impulse value .",
    "the former is characterized by the linear pde in  ( [ iqv ] ) , while the latter is expressed by the obstacle ( or reflected ) part in ( [ iqv ] ) . from the theoretical and numerical point of view",
    ", the main difficulty of the qvi ( [ iqv ] ) lies in that the obstacle contains the solution itself , and it is nonlocal [ see ( [ nonlocalh ] ) ] due to the jumps induced by the impulse control .",
    "these features make the classical approach of numerically solving such impulse control problems particular challenging .",
    "an alternative method to attack the qvi ( [ iqv ] ) is to find the probabilistic representation of the solution using the backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) , namely the so - called nonlinear feynman  kac formula .",
    "one can then hope to use such a representation to derive a direct numerical procedure for the solution of qvis , whence the impulse control problems .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "we consider a poisson random measure @xmath34 on @xmath35 associated to a marked point process @xmath36 .",
    "assume that @xmath37 is independent of @xmath29 and has intensity @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a finite measure on @xmath14 .",
    "consider a ( uncontrolled ) jump - diffusion process @xmath40 assume that @xmath7 is a `` smooth '' solution to ( [ iqv ] ) , and define @xmath41 .",
    "then , by it s formula , we have @xmath42\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } - \\int_t^t\\int_e \\bigl ( u_s(e ) - c(x_{s^-},e ) \\bigr ) \\mu(ds , de),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath7 satisfies ( [ iqv ] ) , we see that @xmath46 is a continuous ( hence , predictable ) , nondecreasing process and @xmath47 satisfies the constraint @xmath48 the idea is then to view ( [ bsdegen0pre ] ) and ( [ conspre ] ) as a bsde with jump constraints , and we expect to retrieve @xmath49 by solving the `` minimal '' solution @xmath50 to this constrained bsde .",
    "we can also look at the bsde above slightly differently .",
    "let us denote @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 is still a nondecreasing process , and equation ( [ bsdegen0pre ] ) can now be rewritten as @xmath54\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } - \\int_t^t \\langle z_s , dw_s\\rangle+ \\bar k_t - \\bar k_t.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall prove that @xmath49 can also be retrieved by looking at the minimal solution @xmath55 to this bsde .",
    "in fact , the following relation holds ( assuming @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 notice that ( [ super ] ) also has a financial interpretation .",
    "that is , @xmath58 is the minimal capital allowing to superhedge the payoff @xmath59 by trading only the asset @xmath29 . here",
    ", the market is obviously incomplete , since the jump part of the underlying asset @xmath60 is not hedgeable .",
    "this connection between the impulse control problem ( [ impulse ] ) and the stochastic target problem defined by the r.h.s . of ( [ super ] )",
    "was originally proved in bouchard @xcite .    inspired by the above discussion",
    ", we now introduce the following general bsde : @xmath61\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } - \\int_t^t\\int_e \\bigl ( u_s(e ) - c(x_{s^-},y_{s^-},z_{s},e ) \\bigr ) \\mu(ds , de),\\qquad 0 \\leq t \\leq t , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with constraints on the jump component in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a given nonincreasing function .",
    "the solution to the bsde is a quadruple @xmath50 where , besides the usual component @xmath64 , the fourth component @xmath46 is a nondecreasing , cdlg , adapted process , null at zero , which makes the constraint ( [ hcons0 ] ) possible .",
    "we note that without the constraint ( [ hcons0 ] ) , the bsde with @xmath65 was studied by tang and li @xcite and barles , buckdahn and pardoux @xcite .",
    "however , with the presence of the constraint , we may not have the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "we thus look only for the minimal solution @xmath50 , in the sense that for any other solution @xmath66 satisfying ( [ bsdegen0 ] ) and ( [ hcons0 ] ) , it must hold that @xmath67 . clearly , this bsde is a generalized version of ( [ bsdegen0pre ] ) and ( [ conspre ] ) , where the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are independent of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "we can also consider the counterpart of ( [ yfor ] ) , namely finding the minimal solution @xmath73 of the bsde @xmath74 it is then conceivable , as we shall prove , that this problem is a special case of ( [ bsdegen0 ] ) and ( [ hcons0 ] ) with @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth noting that if the generator @xmath68 and the cost function @xmath69 do not depend on @xmath75 , which we refer to as the impulse control case , the existence of a minimal solution to the constrained bsdes ( [ bsdegen0pre ] ) and ( [ conspre ] ) may be directly obtained by supermartingale decomposition method in the spirit of el karoui and quenez @xcite for the dual representation of the super - replication cost of @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , the results could be extended easily to the case where @xmath68 is linear in @xmath71 , via a simple application of the girsanov transformation . in our general case , however , we shall follow a penalization method , as was done in el karoui et al .",
    "namely , we construct a suitable sequence @xmath77 of bsdes with jumps , and prove that it converges to the minimal solution that we are looking for .",
    "this is achieved as follows .",
    "we first show the convergence of the sequence @xmath78 by relying on comparison results for bsdes with jumps , see @xcite .",
    "the proof of convergence of the components @xmath79 is more delicate , and is obtained by using a weak compactness argument due to peng @xcite .",
    "our next task of this paper is to relate the minimal solution to the bsde with constrained jumps to the viscosity solutions to the following general qvi : @xmath80 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the nonlocal semilinear operator @xmath81.\\ ] ] under suitable assumptions , we shall also prove the uniqueness of the viscosity solution , leading to a new probabilistic representation for this parabolic qvi .",
    "we should point out that bsdes with constraints have been studied by many authors .",
    "for example , el karoui et al .",
    "@xcite studied the reflected bsdes , in which the component @xmath82 is forced to stay above a given obstacle ; cvitanic , karatzas and soner @xcite , and buckdahn and hu @xcite considered the case where the constraints are imposed on the component @xmath83 .",
    "recently , peng @xcite ( see also @xcite ) studied the the general case where constraints are given on both @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which relates these constrained bsdes to variational inequalities .",
    "the main feature of this work is to consider constraints on the jump component ( @xmath47 ) of the solution , and to relate these jump - constrained bsdes to quasi - variational inequalities . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical approach in the theory and numerical approximation of impulse control problems and qvis is to consider them as obstacle problems and iterated optimal stopping problems .",
    "however , our penalization procedure for jump - constrained bsdes suggests a noniterative approximation scheme for qvis , based on the simulation of the bsdes , which , to our best knowledge , is new .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we give a detailed formulation of bsdes with constrained jumps , and show how it includes problem ( [ bsde1 ] ) as special case .",
    "moreover , in the special case of impulse control , we directly construct and show the existence of a minimal solution . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we develop the penalization approach for studying the existence of a minimal solution to our constrained bsde for general @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath63 .",
    "we show in section [ secrelqvi ] that the minimal solution to this constrained bsde provides a probabilistic representation for the unique viscosity solution to a parabolic qvi .",
    "finally , in section [ secsuff ] , we provide some examples of sufficient conditions under which our general assumptions are satisfied .",
    "throughout this paper , we assume that @xmath84 is a complete probability space on which are defined a @xmath30-dimensional standard brownian motion @xmath85 , and a poisson random measure @xmath37 on @xmath35 , where @xmath14 is a compact set of @xmath15 , endowed with its borel field @xmath86 .",
