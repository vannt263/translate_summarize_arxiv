    "there is evidence from a number of numerical simulations in 3 and 4 dimensions @xcite that the first order phase transition from the symmetric to broken phase of the electroweak sector of the standard model ends for a higgs mass of approximately @xmath3 . for larger higgs masses",
    ", there is analytic crossover or very possibly a transition where higher order derivatives of the free energy experience a discontinuity ( these are sometimes referred to as `` third or higher order '' phase transitions , whether numerical studies could ever distinguish between these two scenarios remains to be seen ) .",
    "the preliminary lower bound of @xmath4 for the higgs mass @xcite indicates that this latter region of phase space , where the behaviour of equal time correlation functions is much smoother , is physically far more likely .",
    "this endpoint , and the fact that the first order phase transition is very weak for smaller higgs masses @xcite indicates that baryogenesis can not occur via this mechanism in the standard model ( sm ) . as a result",
    ", a number of other suggestions have been made to get around this .",
    "many of these proposals make non - trivial statements about the early universe .",
    "while the qualitative picture of supersymmetric models is no different from the sm , it is hoped that the extra fields will adjust the position and strength of the phase transition sufficiently that larger higgs masses are feasible @xcite .",
    "other models introduce extensions to the sm , including the formation of topological defects to provide the out of equilibrium condition @xcite , or change the expected rate of expansion of the universe at the ew epoch @xcite so that a phase transition is unnecessary and only sufficiently rapid change is sufficient .",
    "it is therefore of interest to explore the baryon number violating properties in this region of parameter space .",
    "a study to see if defect formation can occur in this region would also be of interest . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the first point . here",
    "we attempt to calculate the rate of diffusion for the chern - simons number defined as @xmath5 which labels the change in the baryon number as a function of time ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "such an unequal - time correlation function is extremely difficult to calculate in a full quantum field theory , discretised on a lattice , as the introduction of a density matrix operator ensures that the exponential weight in a monte - carlo simulation will be complex and will fluctuate enormously .",
    "however , noting that on dimensionful grounds the typical size of the sphaleron is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature , a classical interpretation of the problem seems to be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the accuracy of such an approach is of some debate but has been successfully utilised by an number of different groups for pure @xmath0 gauge theories and @xmath0higgs systems with @xmath8 @xcite . here , we choose a higgs mass of approximately @xmath1 and",
    "have determined the diffusion rate for a range of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing , and two volumes .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows ; in section 2 we outline briefly the method of calculation , describing the discretised hamiltonian and the choice of bare lattice parameters . in section 3",
    "we present an analysis of the results and determine their behaviour in terms of physical observables .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions on the applications of this approach .",
    "we employ the methods used in @xcite to evaluate the _ classical _ diffusion rate of the chern simons number .",
    "the original 4-dimensional @xmath11-higgs lagrangian is dimensionally reduced by the high - temperature matsubara formalism to a surprisingly simple 3-dimensional lagrangian , whose couplings are related to the original lagrangian s coupling by perturbation theory @xcite . to measure a quasi - equilibrium quantity such as the above diffusion rate , one introduces conjugate momenta fields which allow the fields to evolve in a hamiltonian formalism , while staying in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the @xmath11 scalar and gauge fields are represented in a discrete form by the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , where @xmath14 is the site index .",
    "the conjugate momenta fields are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the following discretised hamiltonian was employed @xmath17 \\;\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the elementary plaquette constructed from the gauge fields surrounding that point .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 controls the time step size and was set to @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the effect of the renormalisation of the momentum operators by the dimensional reduction and is assumed to take the form @xmath24 . the validity of this assumption ( or indeed whether higher dimensional operators should be included ) is still a topic of discussion .",
    "no estimate of the one - loop corrections to @xmath22 and @xmath23 have been made and we have assumed them to be 1 .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 control the physical parameters of the system ; the lattice spacing @xmath10 , the higgs mass @xmath28 and the temperature @xmath7 . at this level of approximation",
    ", it is assumed that the couplings @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( for the original 4-dimensional lagrangian ) do not run and that many of the standard tree - level results can be applied .",
    "noting that @xmath31 and that at tree - level @xmath32 it is clear that one can fix @xmath33 and @xmath9 simply from the @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the relationship that the parameter @xmath34 has to @xmath33 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 is more complicated .",
    "one could vary @xmath34 and @xmath25 so that @xmath10 is fixed .",
    "however , for this paper we shall take a more simple route by fixing @xmath27 and @xmath34 and varying @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio @xmath35 as a function of @xmath25 can be determined from a perturbative relationship @xcite .    for this paper , @xmath27",
    "was set to @xmath36 and @xmath34 to @xmath37 using two lattice sizes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the coupling @xmath25 was varied from 6.8 to 7.8 in steps of 0.1 . for each @xmath25",
    ", 8 to 16 configurations were thermalised and then evolved using a leapfrog algorithm for time lengths greater than 6000 .",
    "the chern - simons number was measured using the slave - field technique devised by moore and turok @xcite at intervals of 5 time units .",
    "the simulation parameters are listed in table ( [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "the code used for thermalisation and evolution was developed by guy moore and neil turok and was run on a silicon graphics origin 2000 made available by the u.k . computational cosmology consortium ( ukccc ) and an hitachi sr2201 at the high performance computing facility ( hpcf ) at the university of cambridge .",
    "assuming the behaviour of @xmath40 is diffusive , then @xmath41 examples of this expectation value as a function of time are shown in figure ( [ fig : random_walk ] ) . to isolate @xmath42 the cosine transform technique , outlined in @xcite , was used .",
    "this involves integrating the data with a cosine weighting over the trajectory length . for a finite time spacing @xmath20 and a trajectory length of @xmath43",
    "this corresponds to evaluating @xmath44   \\ ; \\;,\\ ] ] where the index @xmath45 corresponds to an individual configuration .",
    "averages over configurations are denoted with @xmath46 .",
    "an example of the resulting coefficients are shown in figure ( [ fig : cosines ] ) .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a white noise term , although a functional fit to this form was not used .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 were averaged in bins of 50 which considerably reduced the resulting error .",
    "an example of this is shown in in figure ( [ fig : bin_cosine ] ) .",
    "the final central value was determined from the central value of the binned data of order 50 to 99 , as higher orders will be affected by ultra - violet contributions while smaller coefficients may be affected by the finite length of the trajectory . if the other binned coefficients of 1 - 49 or 100 - 149 varied by more than a standard deviation from this , the difference was included as a systematic error .    in order to express the results in terms of a dimensionless intensive quantity @xmath50 , the diffusion rate in the continuum @xmath51",
    "is usually expressed as @xmath52 ( although it remains unclear if @xmath50 has some residual dependence on @xmath53 @xcite ) .",
    "equivalently , for the lattice result @xmath54 the results for @xmath55 are listed in table ( [ tab : params ] ) .",
    "in this letter , we have calculated the diffusion rate of the chern simons number for an @xmath11higgs field theory at approximately fixed higgs mass for a range of temperatures .",
    "we see that the rate is independent of volume and varies from a constant non - zero rate , in the symmetric phase to a zero rate in the broken phase ( the use of the word `` phase '' here is perhaps slightly vague and should be redefined in this case by the region of parameter space with properties similar to the other region of parameter space where a phase transition occurs ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 can be determined from perturbative matching of the 3 and 4 dimensional coefficients as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the change from a zero to non - zero rate occurs for a variation in @xmath56 of approximately 20% .",
    "this is broader than the case when @xmath57 , which was approximately 10% @xcite . assuming the higgs mass is fixed at @xmath58 we see that the mean crossover temperature ( @xmath59 ) is larger than is expected from the study of equal - time correlation functions ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "a more precise study in parameter space is certainly possible , where the lattice spacing is kept constant and only the temperature varied .",
    "this would involve calculating the higgs and @xmath61 mass for each possible configuration of parameters to determine the lattice spacing .",
    "however , as it unclear how accurate the classical approximation is , such an exhaustive approach may be fruitless .",
    "nonetheless , the chern - simons diffusion rate is an excellent observable for studying the complicated crossover region of such field theories .",
    "equal - time correlation functions provide very clear signals in the region where a first - order phase transition exists .",
    "however in the region of large higgs mass , their behaviour is non - singular and the distinction between analytic crossover and possible discontinuities becomes quite difficult .",
    "the chern - simons diffusion rate has behaviour that is clearer and independent of volume which defines two separate regions .",
    "one area this study may well be of use is in the area of defect formation for large - structure formation in the early universe .",
    "it is not clear whether defects can form in this crossover region . in the future",
    "we plan to study this .",
    "the code for thermalising and evolving the configurations was written by guy moore and neil turok and we express our gratitude for their generosity in letting us use this code .",
    "we express our thanks to the ukccc and hpcf for their support while running this code .",
