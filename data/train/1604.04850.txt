    "now , it is believed that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a fundamental theory of the strong interaction . in qcd",
    ", the strong interaction is described by an @xmath1 gauge theory of quarks and gluons with the lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the generator of @xmath1 group satisfying @xmath4 , the subscripts @xmath5 stand for the color indices , the summation is over the flavor index @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the field strength tensor of gluon fields , @xmath8 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath9 is the structure constant of @xmath1 group . in qcd ,",
    "the fundamental parameters are the coupling constant @xmath8 ( or @xmath10 ) and the current quark masses @xmath11 .",
    "theoretically , it is proved that the coupling constant @xmath12 satisfies the following renormalization group equation at one - loop order  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of flavors .",
    "this implies that in case of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 , which is satisfied by the present observation @xmath17 , @xmath12 decreases with the increase of energy transfer , that is , qcd is an asymptotically free theory .",
    "because of the asymptotic freedom , the coupling constant @xmath8 is large at low energy scale so that one can not analytically calculate the low energy strong processes using the standard perturbative theory of qcd where the coupling constant @xmath8 is regarded as an expansion parameter . in addition , although the numerical simulation of hadron properties based on lattice technique got great progresses recently , it suffers from the notorious sign problem when one attempts to apply this technique to the chiral symmetry restoration region in the dense system . so that , to study the low energy processes of strong interaction , some effective theories or models are necessary .",
    "this lecture is devoted to introduce one of the effective models for baryons , the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "the advantageous of skyrme model which we will learn in the lecture is that , using this model , we can describe the meson and baryon dynamics in free space , the baryonic matter and also medium modified hadron properties  @xcite in a unified manner .",
    "the skyrme model is constructed based on a nonlinear mesonic theory possessing a non - trivial topological field configuration ( soliton ) which can be identified with baryon .",
    "this model was proposed more than 50 years ago by t.h.r .",
    "skyrme  @xcite .",
    "however it was not taken seriously until the compelling arguments proposed by e. witten  @xcite which combined the t hooft large @xmath0 expansion  @xcite with current algebra , and from then on the skyrme s theory was widely applied in baryon and baryonic matter physics ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this lecture note is organized as follows :    considering the importance of the large @xmath0 expansion in understanding the intrinsic charactors of skyrme model and chiral symmetry of qcd in the study of low energy hadron physics , we will briefly discuss them in chapter  [ sec : prelim ] .    in chapter  [",
    "sec : nonlinearsigma ] , starting from the linear sigma model we discuss the nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the power counting mechanism of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) is briefly introduced . following this",
    ", we discuss the topology of the nonlinear sigma model and show that a non - trivial topological configuration of the nonlinear sigma model has the following properties shared by baryons in the large @xmath0 limit :    1 .",
    "it carries a conserved topological charge which can be identified with the conserved baryon number in qcd .",
    "it is a heavy object and interacts strongly with another configuration .",
    "these properties are consistent with the qualitative argument of baryon properties based on the large @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "3 .   it yields a rich quantum sector by collectively quantizing the static soliton so one can identify the quantized soliton with baryon .    in chapter",
    "[ sec : skyrmodel ] we discuss the skyrme model and its applications .",
    "the basics of the skyrme model , such as its static solution and quantization , is involved .",
    "after this , we discuss the applications of the skyrme model to the baryon properties .",
    "the main points in the calculations of the axial coupling , charge radii and magnetic moment of baryons are briefly explained .",
    "we discuss in chapter [ sec : matter ] the applications of skyrme model to nuclear physics starting from the exploration of the two - body nuclear force by using the product ansatz of skyrmions which is proper when the two interacting skyrmions are far away from each other .",
    "this exploration tells us how to arrange the nearest skyrmions to get the strongest attractive interaction .",
    "by putting the skyrmion onto the crystal lattice we investigate the nuclear matter properties by regarding the skymion matter as nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "we discuss three kinds of crystal structures used so far in the literature in the study of nuclear matter , i.e. , cubic crystal , body - centered cubic crystal and face - centered cubic crystal . as a typical example",
    ", we explicitly show how the nuclear matter properties and the medium modified hadron properties could be explored based on the face - centered cubic crystal .",
    "nuclear physics tells us that the vector mesons are crucial for understanding nuclear force , we discuss this aspect in chaper  [ sec : skyrhls ] . in this chapter , we first introduce the basic of a chiral effective model of vector mesons , the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) approach  @xcite",
    ". then we study the skyrmion properties , such as soliton mass and moment of inertia , including the vector meson effect from the leading order hls lagrangian .",
    "the last chapter is for a discussion of the recent developments and remarks of some possible further applications of the skyrme model .",
    "in this chapter , we give the preliminary of our lecture : ( 1 ) large @xmath0 expansion of qcd and ( 2 ) the chiral symmetry and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .      as pointed in the last chapter , skyrmion and baryon share several properties in the sense of large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this motivates us to start this lecture from a discussion of the main idea of large @xmath0 expansion  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , after an explanation of the basic idea of the large @xmath0 expansion we will discuss baryon properties from the large @xmath0 expansion which is essential for understanding the baryon dynamics by using the skyrme model .      the essential point in the large @xmath0 expansion is to generalize the number of colors from @xmath18 to @xmath0 and regard the latter as a parameter in the gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "then , in the case of very large @xmath0 , in a feynman diagram , the number of possible intermediate states carrying different colors may be so large that the summing over the possible intermediate states gives rise to a large combinational factor .",
    "this combinational factor is responsible for the nature of the large @xmath0 expansion and the expansion is a power series in @xmath19 .    to illustrate how @xmath0 enters a feynman diagram",
    ", we consider a diagram contributing to the vacuum polarization of gluon depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gluonvp ] .        from qcd",
    "lagrangian one concludes that this diagram is of the quadratic order of the qcd coupling constant @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , with respect to the structure constant of the non - abelian gauge group su(@xmath0 ) , this diagram is easily deduced to be @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we finally conclude that fig .  [ fig : gluonvp ] scales as @xmath22 .",
    "this tells us that we should consider the large @xmath0 limit with @xmath23 fixed , otherwise , the corrections to the gluon propagator would diverge for a large number of colors and this divergence hinders us to construct a self - consistent qcd theory for a large number of colors . with respect to the above argument , one may define an effective coupling constant @xmath24 which is a smooth function of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath25 , and relates to qcd coupling constant through @xmath26 since @xmath27 , when the number of colors @xmath0 is large , qcd becomes a weakly coupled gauge theory . in terms of @xmath24 , each qcd vertex receives a combinational factor @xmath28 . therefore the feynman diagram which survives under @xmath29 limit",
    "must have a large combinational factor to compensate the factor @xmath28 coming from qcd vertex .",
    "the combinational factor can be easily calculated by using the double - line notations for the quark and gluon fields  @xcite . in quantum field theory",
    ", we represent a quark field with color index @xmath30 , @xmath31 , by an arrowed line and an anti - quark field with color index @xmath30 , @xmath32 , by an arrowed line with arrow direction opposite to that of the quark field .",
    "now , we explicitly write down the color indices of the gluon field @xmath33",
    ". then we can think the gluon field as a quark - antiquark field @xmath34 which suggests that , similarly as the representing of quark propagator with an arrowed line , we could represent the gluon propagator as a doubly arrowed line with one carrying color index and the other carrying anticolor index .",
    "these line expressions can be illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : doublelgluon ] .        with the double - line notation of gluon fields , one can express the qcd interaction vertex @xmath35 as in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublelvertex ] . and in this notation , the color conservation is simply expressed by the fact that each color line that enters the diagram also leaves it .        by using the double - line notation ,",
    "the @xmath0 counting of a feynman diagram can be easily determined .",
    "for example , the gluon vacuum polarization can be illustrated by the double - line notation as in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublelgvp ] .",
    "this shows that , in the center , there is a closed circle which has a color index @xmath36 so that the sum over @xmath36 gives a factor @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , fig .",
    "[ fig : doublelgvp ] is of order @xmath37 .",
    "one can easily arrive at the following conclusion of a feynman diagram from the double - line notation : _ the @xmath0 counting of a feynman diagram with @xmath38 @xmath8 and @xmath39 closed loops is @xmath40 . as a result ,",
    "in the limit @xmath29 , the diagram is divergent for @xmath41 while for @xmath42 , it s @xmath43 .",
    "diagrams in these two cases survive in the @xmath29 limit .",
    "however , a diagram with @xmath44 is suppressed by positive power of @xmath19 and therefore vanishes in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "_      the discussion of meson properties in the large @xmath0 expansion could be made by introducing the gauge invariant quark bi - linear operators with the consistent quantum numbers for generating the interested mesons from vacuum .",
    "since mesons are color neutral , the interpolated current should be color singlet . in the following ,",
    "the relevant currents are denoted by @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the gluon field .",
    "we first explore the meson mass and its decay constant by considering the current correlator @xmath47 . since the current @xmath48 is a color singlet , in terms of the double - line notation , one can easily check that there should have at least one quark loop at the edges thus the diagram is of @xmath49 at leading order .",
    "a typical diagram was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkbilinear ] . by inserting a complete meson intermediate state @xmath50 into the correlator contribution ]",

    "@xmath52 is the mass of the @xmath38th meson , and @xmath53 is the @xmath38th meson decay constant which denotes the amplitude for creating meson @xmath54 from the vacuum by the current @xmath48 . since the two - point function is of order @xmath0 , @xmath55 the same as the left - hand side , the right - hand side of ( [ eq:2pointmeson ] ) should have a smooth limit for large @xmath0 , consequently the meson masses have smooth limits . to guarantee that the left hand side of eq .",

    "one can easily discuss the leading @xmath0 order of an @xmath38-meson vertex by using the @xmath0 scaling of the meson decay constant . in the spectral decomposition",
    "the @xmath38-point quark bilinear correlation function has contributions of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the @xmath38-meson vertex function .",
    "since the correlation function scales like @xmath0 , the @xmath0 scaling of @xmath59 is @xmath60 in the case of @xmath61 one concludes that @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that _ in the framework of large @xmath0 expansion , an effective meson model becomes a weakly coupled model and the meson decay is forbidden in the large @xmath0 limit_.    the above discussions on mesons made of quark - antiquark can be extended to glueball states . by considering the relevant correlation functions of current @xmath63 which creates a glueball field",
    "one can deduce that the glueball decay constant @xmath64 is of @xmath49 and glueball mass @xmath65 is @xmath25 .",
    "_ in the @xmath29 limit , gluball states are free , stable , non - interacting , and infinite in number . _",
    "next , we consider the @xmath0 order of the glueball and meson mixing",
    ". this could be achieved by considering the following spectral representation of the corresponding correlator @xmath66 from fig .",
    "[ fig : glueballmesonmix ] one sees that , because there are two gluon - quark vertices , the @xmath0 power of the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glueballmesonmixing ] ) is @xmath67 consequently we have @xmath68 which means that the amplitude for mixing a glueball state to a diquark meson is of order @xmath28 . _",
    "therefore , one concludes that , in the large @xmath0 limit , the glueball states are decoupled from mesons_.        by using the same procedure , one can arrive at the following conclusion : _ the amplitude for a glueball state decaying to two glueball states or to two mesons is of order @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitudes for glueball - glueball and glueball - meson elastic scattering are of order @xmath69 .",
    "_    _ in summary , to the leading order in @xmath19 , amplitudes of diagrams of interactions with arbitrary numbers of meson and glueball states can be obtained by summing over the tree diagrams and , in these diagrams the general local vertex with @xmath36 mesons and @xmath6 glueball states is of order @xmath70 ( except @xmath71 in which case it is of order @xmath72 ) .",
    "_ for example , the diagram with one glueball and one meson interaction is of order @xmath73 which agrees with the above discussion of the glueball - meson mixing .      in the case that there are @xmath0 colors , the lowest lying baryons must be the composite states of @xmath0 quarks and must have wave functions which are totally antisymmetric in color indices and therefore symmetric in all other indices .",
    "it is because of this structure the large @xmath0 behavior of baryon is more subtle than that of meson since , in the feynman diagrams for baryons , both the combinational factors and the shape of the diagrams depend on @xmath0 .",
    "if one naively considers the corrections to the baryon propagator from @xmath39-gluon exchanging among the @xmath0 constituent quarks , the @xmath0 counting of the corrections is @xmath74^{m } & \\sim & \\mathcal{o}(n_c^m).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation tells us that , as @xmath0 tends to infinity , the perturbative expansion of @xmath8 ( here , number of gluon exchanging ) is divergent which contradicts to the baryon properties which have a smooth limit in @xmath0 .",
    "this contradiction indicates that the @xmath0 counting from the diagram representation is not convenient to explore the @xmath0 behaviours of baryon properties .",
    "e.witten invented a proper way to sum all contributions based on the many - body techniques  @xcite .",
    "he considered the case that the quarks in a baryon are so heavy that can be treated as non - relativistic objects .",
    "in such a case , the many - body problem can be reduced to a two - body problem in the hartree approach in which a single quark is sitting in an average potential generated by the remaining @xmath75 quarks .",
    "then the hamilton operator reads @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the mass of a single quark in the baryon .",
    "the wave function of the ground state baryon can be construct from the quark constituents which are arranged in the s - wave as @xmath78 thus we have the following eigenvalue equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the energy of a baryon carried by each quark .",
    ".   tells us that baryon masses are @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , one can obtain the charge radius of a nucleon as @xmath83 because @xmath84 has a smooth large @xmath0 limit",
    ".    from one sees that the average potential carried by one quark in a baryon is @xmath85 .",
    "this conclusion is still intact even when the three- and four - body forces arising from the self - interaction of gluons are included because the increasing of @xmath0 power from the combination of quarks is compensated by the increasing of the @xmath86 power .",
    "thus no matter how complicated the relativistic hartree problem is , baryon masses are @xmath82 and the radii of baryons are @xmath87 .",
    "for the baryon - baryon scattering there are @xmath88 possibilities to exchange one gluon between two quarks in the @xmath89 constituents of the two baryons .",
    "since there is a coupling constant @xmath8 at each end of the exchanged gluon , the contribution from these diagrams to the energy of the two - baryon system is @xmath82 .",
    "however , for the meson - baryon scattering , the situation is different .",
    "since we can only pick a single quark from the meson , the one gluon exchange contribution to the system energy is @xmath85 .",
    "this means that in the meson - baryon scattering process , in the large @xmath0 limit , the baryon stays as a static source and only the meson reacts . in summary",
    ", we have the following conclusions for baryon behaviors  @xcite :    1 .",
    "baryon masses are proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "baryon radii are @xmath85 .",

    "as mentioned before , the advantage of the skyrme model is that , by putting skyrmions on to the crystal lattice , both hadron properties in free space and in medium can be investigated simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "therefore one can use this model to study the chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite and the equation of state ( eos ) of baryonic matter and also the neutron star properties  @xcite .",
    "lessons from nuclear physics tell us that the scalar meson which is an iso - singlet is essential for providing the binding force between nucleons . however , how to include this scalar is highly nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the minimal skyrme model , it was found that casimir force induced by the loop correction in @xmath382-channel @xmath283-@xmath283 scattering could contribute about @xmath383mev to the skyrmion mass therefore the calculated nucleon mass from the minimal skyrme model agrees with its physical value  @xcite . so that it deserved to estimate the casimir energy in models including higher resonances .",
