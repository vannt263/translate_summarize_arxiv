    "as was pointed out by slater as early as in the 1930s,@xcite the intra - atomic ( hund s ) exchange interaction is of great importance for ferromagnetism in transition metals .",
    "also the intensive study of transition - metal oxides  fueled by the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity  revealed the pivotal role of orbitals and hund s exchange , not only for ferromagnetism but , e.g. , also for the metal - insulator transition @xcite and unconventional superconductivity.@xcite    for studying such correlation effects in multiorbital systems , the dynamical mean - field theory@xcite ( dmft ) is one of the most successful methods .",
    "it takes into account temporal fluctuations but neglects spatial ones , and is known to describe the mott - hubbard transition.@xcite recently , the multiorbital mott - hubbard transition has been studied most intensively by dmft , @xcite showing that the correct symmetry of the exchange coupling is essential , in particular , close to and at the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "also for realistic material calculations , multiorbital dmft is important . in particular , the so - called local density approximation",
    "( lda)+dmft method@xcite allows for calculating strong correlations in materials from first principles , and it has become one of the most active fields in solid state physics.@xcite in this method , dmft solves a model constructed from band structure obtained by the local density approximation .",
    "since materials such as transition - metal oxides usually have several orbitals around @xmath3 , the model is , in general , a multiorbital one .",
    "this multiorbital hubbard model hence consists of the intra- and interorbital coulomb interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , hunds - exchange and the pair - hopping interactions @xmath6 , as well as the one - electron hoppings obtained from the lda .",
    "dmft maps the model self - consistently onto an effective impurity model which includes the same on - site interactions on an impurity site and an infinite number of bath sites , which are coupled to the impurity site through a hybridization ( hopping ) .",
    "this impurity problem has to be solved numerically : for multiorbital models , the exact diagonalization@xcite ( ed ) and the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo ( hfqmc ) method @xcite are the most widely employed nonperturbative impurity solvers .",
    "both ed and hfqmc methods have their pros and cons and are hence favorable in different situations .",
    "ed has the advantage that it can easily handle all the multiorbital interactions including hund s coupling and the pair - hopping term .",
    "however , it is severely restricted in the number of bath sites , even in the lanczos implementations which can take into account most bath sites for @xmath7 or very low temperatures .",
    "@xcite since it can not treat so many sites ( and orbitals ) , dmft ( ed ) studies have been usually limited to two - orbital systems .    on the other hand",
    ", hfqmc simulation can handle not only two but more orbitals and , in contrast to ed , also produces continuous spectra .",
    "the former is important since there are various intriguing systems having three or more orbitals , especially @xmath1 electron , perovskite - type transition - metal oxides , exemplified by the spin - triplet superconductor .",
    "@xmath8@xcite the continuous spectra are crucial for comparing with experiments , e.g. , photoemission spectroscopy . for these reasons",
    "the hfqmc method has been by far the most widely employed impurity solver as far as lda+dmft is concerned .    in most dmft hfqmc studies,@xcite however , only the ising ( @xmath9 ) component of hund s exchange coupling has been considered , with the pair - hopping term neglected .",
    "the reason is that the standard hubbard - stratonovich transformation@xcite is only applicable to the density - density part ( @xmath10 ) of the interactions and something else is required for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of hund s coupling and the pair - hopping interaction ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a straightforward decoupling of @xmath13 leads to a very severe sign problem,@xcite making such qmc calculations virtually impossible .    in order to take into account @xmath13 , we previously proposed a transformation with a real and discrete auxiliary field for these terms in two - orbital systems.@xcite so far , @xmath14-wave superconductivity@xcite and the orbital - selective mott transition@xcite have been investigated with our transformation .    despite these successes ,",
    "some problems remain to be solved .",
    "first , it is still difficult to treat more than two orbitals : since the exponential of @xmath13 is not equal to the product of the exponentials of the distinct two - orbital parts @xmath15 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote orbitals),@xcite we can not decouple @xmath13 for three or more orbitals by the simple product of two - orbital parts .",
    "second , the fermionic sign problem@xcite caused by @xmath13 prevents us from studying low temperatures .    in the present paper",
    "we propose and show that these difficulties are greatly remedied by employing a perturbation series expansion ( pse ) , separating out the problematic @xmath13 term .",
    "it should be noted that the method is numerically exact ( and nonperturbative ) .",
    "also , the method is easily implemented , since our updating algorithm for sampling weights and green s function is basically the same as the hirsch - fye algorithm , with the differences being only for a factor multipling the weights and an additional value for the auxiliary field . while we focus here on dmft , i.e. , qmc simulations for impurity problems , the same ideas can be employed also for the lattice qmc method .",
    "the auxiliary - field qmc method based on pse for electron systems was first proposed by rombouts _",
    "et al._@xcite these authors applied pse to the finite - size single - orbital hubbard model and succeeded in obtaining results without time - discretization errors with less computational time than the conventional , trotter - decomposition algorithm.bs81 although the method uses pse , it counts all the contributions of the interaction since the perturbation order taken into account is higher than the maximum order of the samples above which the weight is virtually zero .",
    "so the scheme is essentially nonperturbative .",
    "@xcite proposed another algorithm to evaluate the series expansion of the partition function and applied it to solve the dmft equations .",
    "it does not involve any auxiliary fields but uses wick s theorem .",
    "recently werner _",
    "@xcite proposed to use a perturbation expansion starting from the strong - coupling limit .    in previous work,@xcite",
    "we extended rombouts algorithm to the multiorbital hubbard hamiltonian , using a similar transformation as in ref .",
    "( 3 ) ] for @xmath13 , i.e. , we expanded the boltzmann factor ( operator ) with respect to the total interaction @xmath18 shifted by a constant .",
    "then , we discretized the imaginary time @xmath19 and used a hirsch - fye - like updating algorithm for solving the impurity model in the dmft context .",
    "although the method significantly relaxes the sign problem and allows , in principle , for more than two orbitals , it turned out that the calculations are too heavy at low temperatures or for strong couplings , especially for more than two orbitals .",
    "that is because the computational effort increases with the perturbation orders appearing in the monte carlo samples .",
    "this order can become very large ( see fig .",
    "2 ) in multiorbital systems since there are many interactions : @xmath20 terms in @xmath10 and @xmath21 terms in @xmath13 per site , where @xmath22 is the number of orbitals .    to overcome this difficulty , we here propose to combine the hfqmc and the pseqmc methods , i.e. , to adopt the series expansion for @xmath13 , while the standard trotter decomposition and hubbard - stratonovich decoupling are employed for @xmath10 .",
    "this algorithm enables us not only to handle three or more orbitals but also to reach much lower temperatures or stronger couplings than hfqmc ( ref .  ) or pseqmc calculations,@xcite even for the two - orbital hubbard model .    in the following ,",
    "we first introduce the multiorbital hubbard model in sec . [",

    "v. section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the paper and gives an outlook .",
    "the @xmath22-orbital hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath26 in orbital @xmath16 at site @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 describes the hopping of electrons between two neighboring sites @xmath30 , which we assume , unless otherwise indicated , to be orbital independent .",
    "@xmath10 is defined to be all the density - density interactions , i.e. , the intraorbital ( @xmath4 ) and interorbital ( @xmath5 ) coulomb interactions and the @xmath9 ( or ising ) component of hund s coupling @xmath6 . by contrast",
    ", @xmath13 takes care of the terms that can not be written as density - density interactions , which consist of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 component of hund s coupling as well as the pair - hopping interaction ( second term ) , in which two electrons in an orbital transfer to other orbitals .",
    "the hamiltonian is rotationally invariant not only in spin space but also in real ( orbital ) space if we satisfy the condition @xmath31 , which comes from the symmetry preserved between the coulombic matrix elements for orbitals in a central field .",
    "we postulate the rotational invariance henceforth .    in the dmft approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) is approximated by an impurity problem where the interactions @xmath10 and @xmath13 are restricted to a test atom ( the impurity ) embedded in the systems ; and @xmath29 describes the coupling to a noninteracting bath which has to be determined self - consistently.@xcite when we develop our algorithm in the next section , @xmath29 , @xmath13 , and @xmath10 denote these terms of the impurity model , but the same ideas can also be applied for lattice qmc simulations of the hubbard model .",
    "we start with the series expansion of the boltzmann factor for continuous time after ref .  .",

    "s coupling @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is physically not so large , whereas we can choose @xmath42 to satisfy @xmath44 .",
    "second , we replace those terms having consecutive @xmath45 s in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis ] ) by proximate terms including only one @xmath45 s per imaginary time interval @xmath46 . for example , @xmath47 is replaced by @xmath48 .",
    "this replacement reduces the number of possible configurations remarkably and casts the summation ( [ eq : dis ] ) into the form ( [ eq : rewrite ] ) similar to the trotter decomposition , which enables us to employ their standard hirsch - fye algorithm with only a slightly more complicated auxiliary field at each time slice .",
    "the error of this approximation ( commutation ) is @xmath49 , i.e. , of the same order as the time discretization , as long as the average order of the series expansion @xmath50 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "this is simply because the terms having two or more consecutive @xmath45 s rarely appear for @xmath51 .",
    "for example , consider the second order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis ] ) .",
    "altogether , there are @xmath52 second - order terms , but only @xmath42 of these terms have two consecutive @xmath45 s with the same imaginary time interval .",
    "hence , the error is at most @xmath53 .",
    "similar argument for higher orders justify the replacement as long as @xmath54 .",
    "since we do not simply drop the terms with two or more consecutive @xmath45 s , but replace them by terms where the @xmath45 s are shifted to neighboring imaginary time intervals , we have to multiply the boltzmann factor by a factor @xmath38 to account for these replacements .",

    "this is because any term with consecutive @xmath11 s will be replaced with a term having such substrings .",
    "for example , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are both approximately the same as @xmath129 [ where commuting an @xmath11 and a @xmath123 yields an error @xmath130 . in general , we commute @xmath11 s and @xmath123 s until there are no consecutive @xmath11 s any longer .",
    "hence , we end up with an alternation of @xmath11 s and @xmath123 s , i.e. , an @xmath129 substring . because of these replacements , terms having such a substring have to be weighted more . in the following ,",
    "we construct a rule for the replacement and weighting factor , avoiding a double counting .",
    "let us denote by @xmath27 a position ( from the left ) in a substring which consists of @xmath16 @xmath11 s and @xmath131 @xmath123 s altogether .",
    "we define @xmath132 and @xmath133 as the number of @xmath11 s and @xmath123 s that are in @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "all substrings having @xmath135 will be replaced with @xmath129 which has alternating @xmath11 s and @xmath123 s .",
    "for example , for @xmath136 @xmath137 and @xmath138 will be replaced with @xmath137 ; for @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 will all be replaced with @xmath142 .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) is necessary to avoid a double counting .",
    "however , the condition ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) excludes the substrings situated at the end of the imaginary time interval for which @xmath143 , so that @xmath144 .",
    "these terms are replaced with a substring @xmath124 , where the last @xmath11 is at @xmath42 , namely , only when the last @xmath11 is at @xmath42 , does @xmath124 replace all the substrings having @xmath16 @xmath11 s and @xmath131 @xmath123 s , which requires a separate treatment ( @xmath145 factors below ) .",
    "a second factor to be taken into account is the correction of the volume in the imaginary - time integrals ; namely , the weight for those terms having consecutive @xmath11 s at @xmath146 in the sum ( [ eq : dis ] ) should be reduced by a factor @xmath147 , since the imaginary times originally satisfy a relation @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pse ] ) . hence the volume for @xmath149 consecutive @xmath11 terms , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ap2 ] ) , should be reduced to @xmath150 .",
    "let us now introduce the quantity @xmath151 for the weight ( apart from the volume factor @xmath152 ) of all the substrings having @xmath27 @xmath123 s and @xmath153 @xmath11 s . for @xmath153 consecutive @xmath11 s",
    ", we simply have the aforementioned @xmath154 factor , i.e. , @xmath155 this is the starting point for the recurrence formula , @xmath156 which arises from taking away the rightmost elements of the type @xmath157 with @xmath158 @xmath11 s from the substring of length @xmath159 . at the end , the recurrance formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursion ] ) yields the weighting factor @xmath160 for the substring ` @xmath124 ' with @xmath16 @xmath11 s and @xmath125 @xmath123 s : @xmath161    only when the last @xmath11 in @xmath129 is situated at the end of the imaginary - time interval ( @xmath42 ) do we use the factor @xmath162 instead , which is obtained via the slightly different recurrence formula [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : am](b ) ] , @xmath163    from the @xmath164 s and @xmath145 s , the total weight @xmath38 is calculated by multiplying the contributions @xmath165 and @xmath166 from each @xmath129-type substring in the boltzmann factor and the volume @xmath167 .",
    "for example , for @xmath168 , @xmath169 in the first example , the boltzmann factor is @xmath170 .",
    "this array replaces itself and @xmath171 , which is weighted @xmath172 , and thereby the factor is @xmath173 multiplied by @xmath174 .",
    "the second example corresponds to @xmath175 , where the substring to be multiplied by a factor is only the last part @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the factor is @xmath176 . in the last example @xmath177 ,",
    "two substrings @xmath137 and @xmath142 are multiplied by @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
