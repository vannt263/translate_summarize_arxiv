    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and afterglows are well described by the relativistic fireball model , in which an explosive flow of relativistic matter is released from a compact central engine ( e.g. a massive stellar collapse or a compact stellar merger ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow is converted into internal energy by shocks , and it is radiated via synchrotron process .",
    "these shocks can be due to collision with the ambient medium ( external shocks ) or shocks inside the flow itself due to nonuniform velocity ( internal shocks ) . the highly variable temporal structure observed in",
    "most of bursts indicates that internal shocks are responsible for the production of grbs . as internal shocks",
    "do not dissipate all the kinetic energy , the remaining energy is dissipated later by external shocks and produces an afterglow .",
    "since the energy radiated in the afterglow phase is comparable or even smaller than that in the prompt gamma - ray phase ( kumar & piran 2000 ; freedman & waxman 2001 ; lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) , grb outflows should be highly irregular .",
    "if we represent the irregular flow by a succession of relativistic shells with random lorentz factors ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; guetta , spada & waxman 2001 ) , the distribution of the lorentz factors should have a large dispersion to achieve a high conversion efficiency in the internal shocks ( beloborodov 2000 ; kobayashi & sari 2001 ) .    recently , lazzati , ghisellini and celotti ( 1999 ) pointed out that , if the lorentz factor distribution is very broad , the radiation drag process could affect the conversion efficiency and spectrum of the internal shock emission ( see also gruzinov & 2000 ; ghisellini 2003 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "when the lorentz factors of shells are distributed in a large interval , fast shells would move in the radiation field produced by the previous collisions , and thus compton - scatter these photons ( bulk compton - scattering ) .",
    "the fast shells could be decelerated before colliding into other shells .",
    "this is of significant interest , because high energy @xmath2-rays could be produced as a consequence of the internal shock model .",
    "observations of high energy radiation will provide valuable information about grb outflows and their central engines . in this letter , we study the bulk compton process by using a numerical random shell model .",
    "we discuss the implication to the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) .",
    "in the internal shock model , central engines are assumed to produce many relativistic expanding shells with a random distribution of lorentz factors .",
    "a collision of two shells is the elementary process to dissipate the kinetic energy of the shells ( e.g. kobayashi et al .",
    "a rapid shell catches up with a slower one and the two merge to form a single one .",
    "electrons are heated by shocks , and the internal energy is then radiated via synchrotron emission .",
    "consider such a merged shell with a lorentz factor @xmath2 , emitting an internal energy @xmath3 .",
    "when a fast shell with a lorentz factor @xmath4 collides into the merged shell , the fast shell scatters the photons emitted from the merged shell . in the comoving frame of the merged shell , the internal energy @xmath5 is emitted isotropically .",
    "then , the fast shell is moving with the relative lorentz factor @xmath6 into the photon field , scattering a fraction @xmath7 of these photons to energies higher by a factor of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the optical depth of the fast shell .",
    "the factor of @xmath10 in the boost factor takes into account that the distribution of the photons which the fast shell scatters is not isotropic , and that head - on scatterings are favored ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2000 ) . using the mass of the fast shell @xmath11",
    ", we can estimate the energy extracted from the fast shell as @xmath12 the fast shell should have a smaller lorentz factor @xmath13 when it catches up to the merged shell .",
    "it is given by @xmath14 a fraction of the kinetic energy @xmath15 is radiated away through the scattering process .",
    "in the standard fireball model , the optical depth @xmath9 of a fireball is close to unity @xmath16 around the internal shock radius , because the parameters are chosen so as to make @xmath17 enabling a non - thermal spectrum , and the `` preferred '' model uses larger baryon loads ( e.g. gruzinov & 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , if merged shells radiate a significant fraction of their kinetic energies through the internal shock synchrotron process , as it is assumed in the standard model , a large velocity contrast in the flow @xmath4 could lead to an efficient production of high energy @xmath2-rays .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations , and discuss how the bulk compton - scattering affects the evolution of multiple shells .",
    "we estimate the conversion efficiency from the kinetic energy of shells to high energy radiation in the bulk compton - scattering .",
    "we consider a flow consisting of @xmath18 shells . each shell",
    "is characterized by four variables : a lorentz factor @xmath19 , a mass @xmath20 , a width @xmath21 and a position @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that the initial lorentz factor of each shell is distributed uniformly in logarithmic space between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the initial masses are assumed to be correlated with the lorentz factors as @xmath25 . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the shells initially have equal energy and equal mass respectively , and for @xmath28 the shells initially have equal density under an assumption of the equal shell width .",
    "we assume a constant value @xmath29 for the initial widths and the initial separations between the shells .",
    "then , the initial positions of the shells are @xmath30 .",
    "the evolution of the shell system in time is basically the same as in kobayashi et al ( 1997 ) , but the radiation drag effect is taken into account . because of the relativistic beaming effect , the radiation from a merged shell with a lorentz factor @xmath2 is concentrated in the forward direction .",
    "a large fraction of photons are emitted around @xmath31 , and they propagate to the radial direction with a velocity of @xmath32 or equivalently an effective lorentz factor of @xmath33 .",
    "we regard the radiation from each collision as a photon packet with the lorentz factor of the merged shell @xmath2 .",
    "since merged shells will further collide with other shells , the lorentz factors of the mergers would significantly change during the evolution .",
    "the lorentz factors of photon packets are assumed to be constant after the productions .",
    "we turn now to describe the evolution of the multiple shell system .",
    "there will be numerous collisions between the shells .",
    "we denote by the index @xmath34 the @xmath34-th collision which takes place at a time @xmath35 .",
    "given the velocities of the shells @xmath36 and their separations at @xmath37 we calculate for all pairs @xmath38 the collision times .",
    "we then find the minimal collision time @xmath39 . after rearranging shells from earlier positions @xmath40 to @xmath41",
    ", we consider the radiation drag effect .",
    "each photon packet is characterized by a position @xmath42 , an energy @xmath43 and a lorentz factor @xmath44 @xmath45 . to estimate the radiation drag effect on shell @xmath46",
    ", we find all the packets @xmath47 which the @xmath46 shell overtakes between @xmath37 and @xmath48 . the lorentz factor of the @xmath46 shell at @xmath48 is evaluated by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the optical depth of the @xmath46 shell at @xmath48 , and we take a sum over the subset @xmath47 . the difference of the kinetic energies @xmath51 is emitted from the @xmath46 shell as high energy photons . since a fraction of the photons in the relevant packets @xmath47 are scattered by the @xmath46 shell , we reduce the energy as @xmath52 .",
    "we estimate the internal energy produced by the @xmath34-th collision by using the energy - momentum conservation ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) in kobayashi et al .",
    "we assign @xmath53 of the internal energy to the @xmath34-th photon packet produced in this collision if the optical depth of the merged shell is less than unity .",
    "we assume that the remaining internal energy is transformed to the kinetic energy of the merged shell .",
    "if the optical depth is larger than unity , the whole internal energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the merger .",
    "we find the next collision and proceed until there are no more collisions , i.e. until all the shells have merged to form a single shell or until the shells are ordered with increasing value of the lorentz factors ( the outermost and innermost are fastest and slowest , respectively ) .",
    "photon packets can boost shells in principle when they catch up with slow shells .",
    "however , the boost effect is of the order of @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 which is the order of the radiation drag effect ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) ) .",
    "we find that the boost effect is negligible in the evolution of the multiple shell system . in this letter",
    ", we discuss only the radiation drag effect .      for @xmath56 shells , @xmath57 , @xmath58 sec and the initial kinetic energy @xmath59 erg ,",
    "we have evaluated the conversion efficiencies of internal shocks and the bulk compton - scattering .",
    "the mean efficiencies and their standard deviations for 100 realizations are listed in table 1 . in the third column ,",
    "`` no scattering '' indicates the internal shock efficiencies obtained without the scattering process .",
    "we can see that the efficiencies of the internal shocks are not influenced by the radiation drag effect significantly even when the velocity dispersion is large @xmath60 .    while the internal shock process is most efficient in the equal mass cases ,",
    "the bulk compton - scattering is most efficient in the equal energy cases .",
    "recently nakar and piran ( 2002 ) studied time scales in grb temporal profiles .",
    "their results imply that the variability in wind s lorentz factors arises because of a modulation of the mass injected into a constant energy flow ( equal energy shells ) .",
    "if this is the case , a significant amount of energy , corresponding to @xmath61 of the prompt gamma - ray energy ( grb energy ) , might be radiated as high energy @xmath2-rays through the bulk compton - scattering .",
    "a large number of collisions @xmath62 happen during the evolution of the multiple shells .",
    "the first collisions occur between the slowest shells @xmath63 and fast shells @xmath64 around @xmath65 . in equal energy cases , the lorentz factors of the merged shells produced by the first collisions are comparable to that of the slowest shells @xmath63 ( eq . ( 1 ) in kobayashi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this property allows other fast shells to catch up with the merged shells at small radii @xmath66 .",
    "since the fast shells still have larger optical depth @xmath67 at the small collision radii , and the relative lorentz factors are larger , the photons emitted from the first mergers are efficiently scattered into high energies . in equal density cases ,",
    "the lorentz factors of the first mergers are close to @xmath68 .",
    "it is difficult for other shells to catch up to the mergers .",
    "since such collisions happen at large radii and the relative velocities are small , the bulk compton - scattering is expected to be inefficient .",
    "in equal mass cases , the lorentz factors of the first mergers take intermediate values @xmath69 .",
    "the efficiency of the scattering process is also expected to be intermediate .    we classify shell collisions occurring in the optically thin region into four cases : ( i ) collisions happen between two shells , both of which have never experienced collisions",
    ". since we are interested in the radiation drag effect , we count only collisions in the optically thin region .",
    "even if a shell has collided with another shell in the optically thick region , we regard the merger as an unexperienced shell . ( ii ) while the outer slow shell went through collisions at least once , this is the first collision for the inner rapid shell .",
    "( iii ) the outer slow shell has never interact with other shells , and the inner rapid shell has experienced collisions at least once .",
    "( iv ) the other cases . assuming the same parameters as in table 1 and @xmath70 , we have performed numerical simulations for the three mass distributions , and we have analyzed all shell collisions in the optically thin region .",
    "we summarize the results for 100 realizations in table 2 .",
    "the radiation drag effect is expected to be most significant in type ii collisions .",
    "actually , in the equal energy case for which the bulk compton - scattering is most efficient , about @xmath71 of collisions are classified into the type ii . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of type iii collisions is larger than that of the type ii in the equal density case .",
    "these results are consistent with the above discussion .",
    "efficient bulk compton - scattering requires the optical depth of shells to be close to unity @xmath16 at internal shock radii . in fig 1 , we plot efficiencies as functions of the variability time scale @xmath72 , and we discuss how the optical depth is sensitive to the choice of the variability time scale . if it is very short @xmath73ms , most collisions happen at small radii",
    ". since the shells still have large optical depth , the internal shock emission is highly suppressed , and consequently only a small amount of energy is up - scatted to high energies . as a larger value of @xmath72 is assumed , a larger fraction of collisions happen in the optically thin region . around @xmath74 a few sec , all the collisions happen in the optically thin region , and the internal shock efficiency ( thin solid line ) is saturated .",
    "the efficiency of the bulk compton - scattering ( thick solid line ) also increases as a larger @xmath72 is assumed , because the internal shocks create thicker photon field .",
    "however , if the variability time is very long @xmath75s , the optical depth of the shells at collision radii is too small to up - scatter the photon field effectively . for our typical parameters , the efficiency of the bulk compton - scattering peaks around @xmath76 sec , which are comparable to the typical variability time scales observed in grb profiles .",
    "all the numerical results obtained so far are for @xmath77 ergs , which is the average value of what we derive from observations .",
    "the distribution of isotropic grb energies spans at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "evaluating the efficiencies for @xmath78 ergs ( dashed lines in fig 1 ) and for @xmath79 ergs ( dashed - dotted lines ) , we found that the asymptotic values of internal shock efficiencies @xmath80 and the peak values of scattering efficiencies @xmath81 are the same , and that the efficiency curves just shift to left or right . as we can expect from the optical depth of shells @xmath82 ,",
    "the saturation time scale for @xmath79ergs , at which the internal shock efficiency is saturated and the scattering efficiency peaks , is one order larger than that for @xmath78ergs .",
    "for the same distribution of lorentz factors , the efficiency of internal shocks does not depend on @xmath83 if all collisions happen in the optical thin region .",
    "the deceleration effect @xmath84 by radiation field is larger for a smaller baryon loading ( a smaller @xmath83 ) .",
    "however , the energy extracted from shells depends on the mass of shells ( baryon loading ) also , and it is determined by the photon field energy as @xmath85 .",
    "the peak values of the scattering efficiencies should have similar values , because the internal shock efficiencies are the same at the saturation time scales .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath53 of the internal energy produced by each collision goes into radiation . assuming a smaller value of @xmath86 or @xmath87 , we re - evaluated the efficiencies in the equal energy case of @xmath70 in table 1 .",
    "the internal shock efficiencies are @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the conversion factors of 0.1 and 0.01 , respectively , while the scattering efficiencies are respectively @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "if less photons are produced , less photons would be scattered .",
    "the ratio of internal shock and scattering efficiencies is almost constant .",
    "we found that the internal shock process is more efficient than the bulk compton - scattering .",
    "the main reason is that internal shocks occur at a rather wide range of radii .",
    "since the optical depth of shells rapidly decreases as @xmath92 , the compton - scattering process is effective only at small radii at which only a small fraction of the kinetic energy of the flow is converted to photon field .",
    "we have analyzed collisions occurring in an equal energy case with the same parameters as in fig 1 and @xmath93s ( the scattering process is most efficient for this @xmath29 ) , and we obtained the following results .",
    "the internal shock emission starts around @xmath94 cm , and the shocks at @xmath95 a few @xmath96 cm contribute effectively to the total internal shock radiation of @xmath97ergs .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath71 and @xmath99 of the radiation are emitted within @xmath100 cm , @xmath101 cm and @xmath102 cm , respectively .",
    "the minimum internal shock radius @xmath103 cm is consistent with the photosphere radius @xmath104 at which mergers becomes optically thin .",
    "it is given by @xmath105 @xmath106ergs@xmath107 cm .",
    "the bulk compton - scattering process starts around @xmath108 , at which the optical depth of scatter shells with @xmath109 is already much smaller than unity , because their masses are smaller than the masses of the mergers .",
    "consequently , the comptonization parameter @xmath110(relative lorentz factor)@xmath111 is on the order of unity at @xmath112 cm and it decreases rapidly at larger radii .",
    "@xmath98 , @xmath71 and @xmath99 of the bulk compton emission are produced within @xmath113 cm , @xmath114 cm and @xmath115 cm , respectively .",
    "although the scattering process is very effective @xmath116 at small radii @xmath117 cm , the energy of the photon field created by the internal shocks at the small radii is @xmath118 of the total internal shock radiation , and then the efficiency from the kinetic energy to high energy radiation in the bulk compton - scattering is of the order of @xmath119 .",
    "if we assume even larger contrasts of lorentz factors ( @xmath120 or larger ) , scattering shells have larger comptonization parameters @xmath121 at the first scattering radius @xmath108 . however , the scattering emission with large relative lorentz factors is suppressed by the klein - nishina effect .",
    "the resulting efficiency of the scattering process is about 4 - 5 @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "the spectra of the high energy radiation produced by the bulk compton - scattering are shown in fig 2 for two example cases .",
    "assuming that all the primary photons produced by shell collisions have the typical grb frequency of @xmath124 kev , we have integrated up - scattered photons to construct the spectra . bursts of high energy emission are expected to occur at the same time with the prompt @xmath2-ray radiation ( grbs ) .",
    "the durations should be comparable to these of the associate grbs . if the lorentz factors of shells are distributed between 10 and @xmath1 , the typical frequency of the bulk compton emission is about 100mev - gev . since the primary photons are scattered to frequencies higher by a boost factor @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath2 are respectively the lorentz factors of the scatter and emitter shells , the typical frequency of the bulk compton emission for @xmath127 is lower , and the emission peaks around 10 - 100 mev .",
    "we have studied the bulk compton - scattering in the internal shock model by using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have shown that the radiation drag does not affect the conversion efficiency in the internal shocks even if fireballs have a very large velocity irregularity .",
    "the bulk compton - scattering is most efficient when an inner engine produces shells with comparable energy but very different lorentz factors .",
    "such equal energy cases are favored in a recent study on grb temporal profiles ( nakar & piran 2002 ) .",
    "we have obtained about a few @xmath122 conversion efficiency of the bulk compton - scattering , provided that the shell s lorentz factor varies between 10 and @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that @xmath128 ergs might be radiated as 100mev - gev @xmath2-rays .",
    "the next generation gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , scheduled for launch in 2007 , will provide unprecedented sensitivity in the energy range of about @xmath129 mev to about 300 gev .",
    "glast should be able to detect the high energy emission produced by the bulk compton - scattering if it is associated with grbs .",
    "glast observations will provide a variable clue to understand the nature of grb outflows and the central engines .    although the synchrotron self - inverse compton - scattering also can produce high energy @xmath2-rays , the typical frequencies ( @xmath130 gev )",
    "could be much higher than that of the bulk compton emission especially when fireballs have large velocity fluctuations as we have assumed in this letter .",
    "recent studies suggest that fireballs could be highly magnetized ( zhang et al .",
    "2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; fan et al .",
    "if this is the case , the self - inverse compton emission could be suppressed .",
    "however , the bulk compton - scattering could still produce high energy @xmath2-rays as long as fireballs are not dominated by poynting - flux .",
