    "recently it was known that the large difference between the planck scale @xmath7 gev and the electroweak scale @xmath8 gev ( so - called the hierarchy problem ) can be produced by introducing the compact extra dimension(s ) .",
    "there are two models with extra dimension(s ) .",
    "one is the add model ( large extra - dimension model ) @xcite , where the extra dimensions are below @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and the extra submanifold is at least two dimensional .",
    "although the add model resolves the hierarchy problem , it causes another hierarchy problem between the electroweak scale and the radius of the extra dimensions .",
    "this comes from the power law behavior of the hierarchy , that is , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the typical radius and the dimension of the extra submanifold , respectively .",
    "the other is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model ( small extra - dimension model ) @xcite , where the classical rs metric is @xmath14 and the extra manifold is a one - dimensional orbifold @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is smaller than the 5-dimensional planck mass @xmath17 gev , @xmath18 is the interbrane distance , and the hidden and visible branes are at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the electroweak scale can be derived from the planck scale via @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the geometrical warp factor appearing in the metric of our brane .",
    "the unwanted extra hierarchy problem does not exist due to the exponential dependence of the hierarchy on the radius @xmath23 unlike the add theory .",
    "when a kind of modulus stabilization with a bulk scalar is added to the rs theory ( since it is impossible to determine the value of the interbrane distance  @xmath24 from the dynamics of the  original \" rs model ) and a kind of dimensional reduction is done , the modulus field ( radion ) couples to the standard model ( sm ) fields like @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the physical field of the radion , @xmath6 is a dimensionful coupling constant of order @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the sm fields .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath6 and the radion mass @xmath0 are phenomenologically important , since they are related to decay rates and cross sections .",
    "there are two kinds of considerations on these parameters until now .",
    "one is experimental , and the other is theoretical .",
    "the experimental consideration is related to the experimentally measured quantities , for example , the decay rates and production cross sections of radion , and the radion loop corrections to the weak mixing angle .",
    "it is noteworthy that the branching ratio of the radion into two gluons is the largest for @xmath29 gev , although it comes from the trace anomaly at the one - loop level .",
    "the recent l3 results on the sm higgs search excluded @xmath30 gev for @xmath31 gev @xcite .",
    "the constraint from the weak mixing angle with errors of order @xmath32 can exclude @xmath33 gev for @xmath34 gev @xcite .",
    "and the lower bound of the radion mass is about @xmath35 gev from limits of neutrino phenomenology and tasso and cleo on inclusive b decays @xcite .",
    "the theoretical one is on the perturbative unitarity .",
    "the perturbative unitarity for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 : sm higgs boson ) is broken for relatively small @xmath38 gev for @xmath39 gev @xcite , and the unitarity bound in the @xmath40 process is @xmath41 gev at @xmath42 tev @xcite .    in this paper , we have constrained the two parameters up to one - loop level in terms of two conditions , warp factor @xmath43 and @xmath4 gev ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the constraint , @xmath45 , was imposed to solve the hierarchy problem @xcite . from the above conditions , the one - loop allowed bounds of @xmath5 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 and @xmath2 , which can be stronger than the previous constraints except the lower bound of radion mass .",
    "it is noteworthy that the one - loop upper bound of the radion mass @xmath5 is about five times larger than the tree - level one of about 49 gev , and still smaller than the masses of the low - lying kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss what fields give important contributions to the effective potential , and analyze the contributions of the scalar and kk mode sectors and those of the fermion and gauge sectors . in section iii , we find the bounds on @xmath5 and @xmath46 from @xmath45 and @xmath4 gev .",
    "the conclusions are in section iv .",
    "when the hierarchy problem is solved with only the one - loop corrections of bulk fields , they generate a very light radion @xcite , which is excluded by experiments of neutrino phenomenology and @xmath48 decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , the stabilization mechanism at the tree level is required .",
    "the mechanism proposed by goldberger and wise @xcite can be a promising one , because they stabilized the modulus without any severe fine - tuning of the parameters in the full theory . in the goldberger - wise stabilization mechanism",
    ", there is a bulk scalar field @xmath49 which has large quartic self - interactions on the hidden and visible branes alone , and a @xmath50-dependent @xmath51 @xmath52 . after replacing the field @xmath49 in the original lagrangian with its @xmath51 @xmath52 and integrating the lagrangian over @xmath50",
    ", we have the modulus stabilizing potential .",
    "the typical energy of this mode is the expectation value of an operator @xmath53 to @xmath52 of order @xmath54 , which makes the effective gravitational coupling constant @xmath55 of the bulk scalar about @xmath56 by the 5-dimensional planck suppression .",
    "thus the quantum correction of the 5-dimensional graviton to the bulk scalar @xmath51 @xmath52 is unimportant in the full theory . and",
    "the quantum corrections from the brane self - interactions of @xmath57 can shift the @xmath51s of the bulk scalar at the branes , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these corrections can change only the coefficients of the radion potential and be equivalent to rescaling of the coefficients .",
    "the 4-dimensional graviton coupling to the radion is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the 4-dimensional ricci scalar .",
    "when the radion @xmath64 is replaced with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the @xmath51 of @xmath64 , the one - graviton coupling constant to the physical field of the radion @xmath26 is planck - suppressed , @xmath67 , since @xmath63 has linear terms of the graviton field @xmath68 in the weak field approximation .",
    "so we can neglect the quantum effects of the 4-dimensional graviton .",
    "there are low - lying kk modes of the bulk scalar and the bulk graviton with masses of @xmath35 tev and non - renormalizable couplings suppressed by tev scale @xcite .",
    "the effects of these low - lying kk modes on the electroweak scale physics are absorbed into the renormalizations of the planck and tev brane tension terms @xmath69 @xcite . since the radion has highly non - renormalizable self - interactions such as @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ vphi ] ) , we treated the radion self - interactions only at the tree level .",
    "for example , the non - renormalizable quantum gravity has a serious problem that the one - loop effective action on the mass - shell is dependent on the gauge fixing parameters @xcite , breaking the dewitt - kallosh theorem @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the loop corrections of the kk modes of bulk fields and the sm particles to the radion effective potential in our brane .",
    "but the one - loop corrections from the kk modes of the bulk scalar and graviton can contribute considerably to the radion potential as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are shifts from the classical planck and tev brane tensions @xmath99 @xcite respectively , belonging to the tension shifts @xmath100 and @xmath101 of @xmath102 in ref .  @xcite . for small @xmath101 , the addition of @xmath103 to the potential @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ vphi ] ) gives a minimum for large @xmath104 , and the adjustment of the tension shift @xmath100 on the planck brane can make the effective four - dimensional cosmological constant vanish . since the shift of the tev brane tension @xmath98 is absorbed into the renormalization of the tev brane tension term @xcite @xmath105 , it can not be obtained from calculation and can only be determined by a renormalization condition relating it to observable quantities @xcite . because the 4-dimensional cosmological constant of order @xmath106 @xcite is regarded as the minimum value of the effective potential @xmath107 of the rs theory , the value of the potential can be approximated as zero at the observed values of @xmath37 and @xmath64 , which should be a stable minimum point of the potential @xcite .",
    "the two renormalization conditions are expressed as @xmath108 at the observed values of @xmath37 and @xmath64 . from these first and second conditions",
    ", we can determine the shifts @xmath100 and @xmath98 respectively , if all the other parameters are known .",
    "the size of the shift @xmath98 can be of order @xmath109 much smaller than @xmath110 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the sign of the kk mode contribution is important in the vacuum stability since it can change the shape of potential .",
    "if @xmath98 is fixed to be negative and @xmath111 increases , the potential becomes deeper and has more parameter points which give stable vacua .",
    "but when the sign is reversed , the number of the allowed points gets smaller , and thus the negative @xmath98 can be favored in terms of stability .",
    "in the randall - sundrum theory , the extra dimension must have a finite size about @xmath133 to solve the hierarchy problem , which gives the constraint , warp factor @xmath134 . and in the standard model",
    ", the @xmath51 of the higgs field is about 246 gev .",
    "this can give a constraint on the higgs @xmath51 of the effective potential in the rs model .",
    "but when the quantum corrections of radion are added to the sm particles , the experimentally determined @xmath51 of the higgs field may be much different from the sm value , that is , the corrections may destroy the above constraint .",
    "when we consider the quantum corrections of the radion to the masses of the sm particles using the lagrangian @xmath135 , the pole masses of leptons and heavy quarks , for example , are @xmath136 \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 are the renormalized masses with the sm loop corrections alone , @xmath138 are the mass parameters in the renormalized lagrangian , @xmath88 is a renormalization scale , and @xmath139 . if @xmath140 , then the radion correction can be large so that the shift of the higgs @xmath51 from the sm one can be large .",
    "( this argument is similarly applied to the gauge bosons and the higgs boson . )",
    "so the condition @xmath141 gev can be spoilt for @xmath140 . but this small range is excluded by the constraint from the weak mixing angle that @xmath142 gev are excluded for @xmath143 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be natural that the physical pole mass ( @xmath144 @xmath145 ) is almost equal to the sm mass ( @xmath144 @xmath137 ) .",
    "this means that the higgs @xmath51 @xmath146 gev can be a physical constraint on our effective potential for the natural range of @xmath6 .",
    "the radion corrections are typically smaller than @xmath147 of @xmath137 , so we can expect that the errors of the higgs @xmath51 from the radion contributions are smaller than @xmath147 .",
    "the procedure to determine @xmath5 and @xmath46 is as follows .",
    "first , we find a parameter point of ( @xmath148 ) which gives a stable vacuum satisfying the two constraints , warp factor @xmath149 and higgs @xmath51 @xmath150 gev .",
    "note that @xmath98 is not considered for the tree - level potential .",
    "of course , the point has to be in the region where perturbation is valid and @xmath132 is real .",
    "next , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath46 are determined from that point by means of equations @xmath151 and @xmath152 . since when a minimum point is found , @xmath97 can be determined trivially via the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ rencond ] ) , we do not include the parameter @xmath97 . because the rs metric @xmath153 is a solution of the  classical \" 5-dimensional einstein s equation , in order to maintain the classical metric we choose parameter ranges where",
    "the loop effects of the quantum gravity can be neglected .    for the tree level potential , the allowed region for the 5-dimensional planck mass of a typical size @xmath154 and",
    "the higgs mass @xmath155 gev is @xmath156 and @xmath157 from fig .",
    "[ tree1 ] , where @xmath152 and @xmath158 .",
    "because of the exponential dependence of @xmath159 , the large change of @xmath160 corresponds to the very small change of @xmath161 , whose central value is about 36 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "this means that the range of the radion @xmath51 @xmath66 is very narrow . from fig .",
    "[ lam - num ] , most of the allowed parameter points ( about 93 percent ) are concentrated around the line @xmath163 gev , and thus the point with a smaller or larger @xmath46 is rare .",
    "therefore , the _ naturally _ allowed region can be much narrower in @xmath46 than the above allowed one .",
    "for the one - loop effective potential , the allowed region for the 5-dimensional planck mass @xmath154 and the higgs mass @xmath155 gev is @xmath1 and @xmath2 from fig .",
    "[ loop1 ] ( the central value of @xmath164 is still about 36 ) . from fig .",
    "[ lam - num ] , almost all the data are focused at @xmath165 gev like the tree level case .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the _ naturally _ allowed regions are similar for the tree and one - loop cases , and there is a small shift of the central value of @xmath46 ( or equivalently @xmath66 ) due to the one - loop corrections .",
    "when @xmath98 and other parameters are changed continuously , the allowed region in fig .  [ loop1 ] can be broader in @xmath46 . from numerical analysis",
    ", we have found that only the negative values of @xmath98 can be allowed . as discussed in section ii",
    ", negative values of the tension shift @xmath98 produce many parameter points which were not allowed at the tree level , and considerable parts of these new points make the radion mass sufficiently larger than the tree - level upper bound of the mass .",
    "it is phenomenologically noteworthy that the one - loop upper bound of the radion mass @xmath5 is rather larger than the tree - level one by about five times .",
    "but the radion is still the first signal of the rs theory lighter than the lowest - lying kk mode with a mass of order @xmath166 , because the radion mass is smaller than about @xmath167 gev . and the branching ratios of the radion into gluon or @xmath168 boson pairs are dominant according to the mass @xmath5 .",
    "the tree level perturbative unitarity can not be stronger than the two constraints , warp factor @xmath149 and higgs @xmath51 @xmath150 gev , in constraining @xmath0 and @xmath6 , since the unitarity bound in the @xmath36 process is @xmath169 at @xmath170 @xcite and the bound in the @xmath40 process is @xmath171 gev at @xmath42 tev @xcite . for the radion mass @xmath31 gev ,",
    "the bounds from the sm higgs search @xcite are helpful , since @xmath172 gev can be excluded .",
    "the limits from neutrino phenomenology and tasso and cleo on inclusive @xmath48 decays give lower bounds of the radion mass about 1 gev @xcite , which agree to our lower bound .",
    "and the region @xmath173 gev for cutoff @xmath174 tev is excluded by the constraint from the weak mixing angle @xcite , since @xmath175 and @xmath150 gev make @xmath5 less than about 260 gev .",
    "most of the previous constraints gives only lower bounds . only the unitary bound in the @xmath40 process gives the weak upper bound of @xmath5 .",
    "compared with the above constraints , the @xmath175 and @xmath150 gev constraints can produce the bounds of @xmath5 and @xmath46 strongly , except the mass lower bound .",
    "assuming the goldberger - wise mechanism in the randall - sundrum theory , we considered the allowed regions of @xmath0 and @xmath46 from two constraints , warp factor @xmath149 and higgs @xmath51 @xmath150 gev , by means of the tree level and one - loop level potentials .",
    "the allowed regions are @xmath176 and @xmath177 for the tree level potential , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 for the one - loop level potential .",
    "it is phenomenologically important that the one - loop allowed upper bound of radion mass @xmath5 is considerably larger than the tree - level one , but the radion is still the first experimental signature of the rs model , since it is lighter than the kk modes .",
    "the mass of the radion is less than about 260 gev , and thus it decays into gluon or @xmath168 boson pairs dominantly . and its loop contributions are small due to the average value of the effective coupling constant @xmath180 ( the average effective fine structure constant is about @xmath181 ) .",
    "the conditions of @xmath182 and @xmath150 gev can give the strong bounds of @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ * note added : * after completing this paper , we received an interesting paper by u. mahanta @xcite , who considered the one - loop contributions of the radion and the kk modes of graviton to the higgs potential .",
    "we did not include the radion contribution due to the non - renormalizability in section ii . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - loop contributions via some approximations are too small to cause any instability of the classical vacuum in the valid region of perturbation theory .",
