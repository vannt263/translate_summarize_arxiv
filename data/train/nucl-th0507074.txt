    "as we all know , only a few of events are center - to - center in au - au collision in rhic because the nucleous has enough volume to be regarded as a ball rather than a point.most of events are peripheral that is only a part of the nuclei collide to each other when two nuclei meet.just as two macroscopical bodies collide peripherally to each other , a global angular momentum will be reserved in the overlapped region in heavy ion collision.it was firstly proposed by liang and wang@xcite . at the same time the unoverlapped parts keep on moving in initial direction and the overlapped part i.e. the source becomes still for the loss of momentum.the questions in front of us is how to verify the existence of the global angular momentum and how to measure it in experiment if it exists .",
    "unfortunately , the first question can not be replied directly because all information about the source we can get is from the final - state particles . on the other hand , many results from both experiment and theory show that an deconfined matter created after the collision .",
    "the first evidence comes from `` jet quenching''@xcite.it was predicted to occur as a result of energy loss by the hard scattered partons due to interactions with the surrounding dense medium @xcite.the theory of this energy loss has been a topic of intense research over the past few years @xcite@xcite.the second evidence is the elliptic flow found in heavy ion cillision .",
    "quark coalescence model@xcite@xcite has been applied to describe the elliptic flow at rhic for different flavors @xcite@xcite.another surprising early measurements from rhic shows that the proton / pion ratio reaches or even exceeds unity for transverse momenta @xmath0 above 2 gev / c @xcite .",
    "one explanation for this phenomena is that quarks originating from different nucleon - nucleon collisions recombine via coalescence mechanisms @xcite@xcite.if an matter composed by partons created in heavy ion collision , the global angular momentum between partons can convert to spin of final - state particles during the formation of these particles@xcite.the reason is that the orbital angular momentum of partons is part of spin of particle .so if the source has global angular momentum , this angular momentum will localize to final - state particles and the particles will be polarized.but if the matter is still confined , the polarization will not happens .",
    "as experimental result supports the formation of deconfined matter , we go to the second question .",
    "now the second question converts to how to measure the polarity of some kind of particle.this question will mainly be discussed in this paper:1,choosing particle and observable;2,arguing the relation between the observable and polarity;3 , factors influencing the measurement .",
    "there are some criterions in choosing the particle to reflect the global angular momentum of the source.firstly,its spin ca nt be zero and its decay - length must be suitable to reconstruct .",
    "secondly , it must decay by weak interaction and its daughter s angular distribution must be spherical asymmetrical because of the break - out of the conservation of parity in weak interaction .",
    "finally , there must be many such particles produced in heavy ion collision so the mass of the particle should not too large . under these",
    "criterions,@xmath1 is a good candidate@xcite .",
    "after the particle is chosen the observable of the particle should be designed subsequently.we define a reaction plane in heavy ion collision by the beam direction and the impact parameter vector and we can fix it in experiment , but we ca nt distinguish which direction is up or down for the polarized particles if they are indeed polarized by the global angular momentum of the source .",
    "the distribution of the daughter of @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath3 and proton ) is written as    @xmath4    @xmath5 is the polar angle in the center of mass frame of polarized @xmath2 when we define the spin direction of @xmath2 as the z axis .",
    "@xmath6 is a constant for @xmath2 decay and it equals 0.642.@xmath7 is the polarizability of @xmath2 . if all the event after turned to reaction plane are counted we will still get a symmetrical distribution of daughters of @xmath2 in the center of mass frame of @xmath2 because the second term of right of ( [ daughter distribution ] ) will give a negative sign if the change of polar angle @xmath5 is @xmath8.to overcome this difficult , we define observable as following .",
    "firstly we should fix the reaction plane in experiment for an event.the reaction plane divide the x - y plane into two parts.we call one of them up direction and the other down direction.the reaction is immovable for the event and the @xmath2 in it.for the event of @xmath9 we can count the number of @xmath2 s whose one of the daughters such as proton belongs to the up or down direction in the center of mass frame of @xmath2 as @xmath10 and @xmath11.it is easy to know @xmath12.we define @xmath13 for the i - th event of @xmath14 s as @xmath15 .then we add @xmath13 for all the events of @xmath9together to get @xmath16 .@xmath17 is the number of all events of @xmath18.we can get @xmath19 the @xmath20 is the observable to reflect the global angular momentum for the event whose number of @xmath2 is @xmath21 .",
    "the next question asked instantly is why and how @xmath20 reflects the existence of the global angular momentum of the source ( i.e.the polarity of @xmath2 emitting from it ) .qualitatively , if @xmath2 emitting from the source is polarized and the reaction plane has been confirmed , the numbers of @xmath2 that crosses two sides of the reaction plane are unequal because of ( [ daughter distribution]).the difference between them is @xmath13 for the i - th event of @xmath14 s. so it is obvious the relation between @xmath20 and the polarization because of the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath13.concretely , we calculate the value of @xmath20 for the unpolarized event firstly , then contrast the value from real data to it .",
    "to explain this issue , the first value should be calculate is the @xmath20 for the unpolarized event.in unpolarized event , the spin direction of @xmath2 is random.so it is easy to get : @xmath22 the value of @xmath20 is listed below :    ( [ unpolarized ] ) can be understand in this way : let s just see proton decayed from @xmath2 .",
    "the probability of there are @xmath23 @xmath24 whose proton belong to up direction of the reaction plane is @xmath25.@xmath26 is @xmath27 i.e.@xmath28 for event of @xmath21 @xmath2.add the probability multiplied by @xmath29 for @xmath23 from 0 to @xmath21 and the expression of @xmath20 can be got as ( [ unpolarized ] ) .    calculating the value of @xmath20 in unpolarized event",
    ", we should estimate the @xmath20 and the variance of it in polarized event for the statistical quantity that we can get from experiment.we can do that just like we define @xmath20 by use of monte carlo.after selecting the events that contain @xmath21 @xmath2s and turning to the center of mass frame of each @xmath2,we produce direction of proton from @xmath2 satisfying the distribution of ( [ daughter distribution ] ) regarding x axis as the reaction plane for all events.then count the number of protons that lies in the first and second quadrants as @xmath30 and that in the third and fourth quadrants as @xmath11.after counting and adding the difference of these two value ( i.e. @xmath31 ) for all event of @xmath21 @xmath2s , we can get @xmath20 by use of ( [ observable]).this process should be repeated for many times for example 50 times to get the variance of @xmath20.the pictures below show the result    the accuracy of this method is determined by the ratio of @xmath32 to the variance of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath33 means the reference value for @xmath20 in unpolarized events listed in fig.1 .",
    "presumedly if the degree of confidence is set to 3@xmath34,we can get signal in case of @xmath350.2.this estimate is from fig.2 and fig.3 with no other factors considered .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is affected by a lot of factors.we will discuss the main ones in this section.obviously,the resolution of reaction plane can influence @xmath20 severely.if the real reaction plane is known , the degree of asymmetry between up and down the reaction plane is the maximum of whatever resolution of reaction plane.on the other hand , if the resolution of reaction plane is @xmath8,in other words , we do nt know the reaction plane , the value of @xmath20 will equal that in unpolarized events.picture below gives the trend of @xmath36 at @xmath37=0.2 .    from fig.4",
    "we can know that if this method is feasible at @xmath21 = 2 and @xmath37=0.2 the resolution of reaction plane must be smaller than 0.4@xmath8 .",
    "this is a quite loose requirement .",
    "another factor is the resolution of momentum.the direction of proton decayed from @xmath2 is measured in the center of mass frame and the transformation from laboratory frame to the center of mass frame needs the momentum of both proton and pion decayed from @xmath2.so the resolution of momentum will affect the direction of daughters of @xmath2.the picture below shows the trend of @xmath36 depending on the momentum resolution at @xmath37=0.2 .",
    "from fig.5 we can know that the variety of @xmath36 depending on the momentum resolution from 0 to 20 mev is unconspicuous .",
    "so the influence from momentum resolution should be small .",
    "there are also other factors that affect @xmath20 , such as the purity of @xmath2.we can estimate the influence of it from the reconstruction of @xmath2 .",
    "an observable @xmath20 to measure the source global angular momentum localization in peripheral au - au collision at rhic is proposed in this article.and the relation between @xmath20 and the polarizability is shown by simulation in which the quantity of statistics is from real data of au - au collision in 200 gev at star in 2001.the variance of @xmath20 is also shown by this.then the factors that can influence @xmath20 are discussed.the influence of momentum resolution is trivial within the resolution of star detector . from simulation result ,",
    "the resolution of reaction plane should be smaller than 0.4@xmath8 for a feasible measurement.if @xmath38 is bigger than 0.2 i.e.@xmath390.312,this method can give a meaningful result with the degree of confidence about 3@xmath34.if @xmath40 is smaller than 0.2,this method can give an upper limit of @xmath7 .",
