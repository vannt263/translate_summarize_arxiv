    "the experiments were performed at the cyclotron laboratory of atomki , in debrecen , hungary . the alpha elastic scattering angular distributions between @xmath18 = 20@xmath19 and @xmath18",
    "= 170@xmath19 were measured on the _ p _ nucleus @xmath0cd  at three energies around the coulomb barrier .",
    "highly enriched @xmath0cd targets ( @xmath20 ) of 250 @xmath21g/@xmath22 thickness were prepared using vacuum evaporation technique .",
    "the experimental setup was similar to that used in previous experiments  @xcite ( and references therein ) . in the following paragraphs , a short outline of the most relevant characteristics of the experimental setup",
    "a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the angular distributions of the elastically scattered alpha particles were measured with the help of two pairs of silicon detectors , mounted on two independently rotatable turntables .",
    "the solid angles of the detectors were between @xmath23 sr and @xmath24 sr .",
    "in addition , two silicon detectors under @xmath18 = 15@xmath25 , with a solid angle of @xmath26 sr were used for absolute normalization , to monitor the target thickness and to take into account the beam position on the target .",
    "the energies of the alpha particle beam were e@xmath3 = 16.1 mev , 17.7 mev and 19.6 mev with typical beam intensities in the order of 250 na .",
    "two different sets of spectra registered during the measurement of the elastic scattering cross section are shown in fig  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "on the left side of the figure , the spectra measured at position @xmath18 = 25@xmath25 are shown for the three measured energies .",
    "the right side of the figure presents the spectra recorded at e@xmath3 = 19.6 mev , for three different angular positions .",
    "as it can be seen , the elastic peak can be easily separated from the additional components , both at forward ( carbon and oxygen peaks ) and backward ( inelastic scattering on @xmath0cd ) angles .",
    "in addition , pulser signals were fed into the pre - amplifiers in order to have a control on the dead - time of the detection system .",
    "the pulser signal amplitude was set so that the pulser peak always falls above the @xmath0cd  elastic peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "knowledge of the exact angular position of the detectors is of crucial importance for the precision of a scattering experiment because the rutherford cross section depends sensitively on the angle .",
    "the uncertainty in the rutherford normalized cross section is dominated by the error of the scattering angles in the forward region . in a similar way to previous experiments  @xcite ( and references therein ) we took advantage of the kinematics of the reaction @xmath27c(@xmath1)@xmath27c and measured the elastically scattered alpha particles in coincidence with the recoil @xmath27c .",
    "we fixed one of the detectors on one side of the chamber at @xmath28 = 80@xmath25 to measure the alpha particles , and measured in coincidence the recoil @xmath27c nuclei around the expected angle of @xmath29 = 40.38@xmath25 .",
    "the result can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_calib ] .",
    "the uncertainty of the scattering angle was determined to be @xmath30 = 0.07@xmath25 .",

    "the rutherford - normalized cross sections cover around 2 orders of magnitude , taking into account all the angular distributions measured ( @xmath36 mev to @xmath37 mev ) . over this range of cross sections ,",
    "our measured angular distributions have an accuracy of around 4 to 5% , while the data in @xcite claim around 1 to 2% at forward angles and the authors add @xmath38% for backward angles due to the relative low enrichment .    in the following",
    ", the analysis of the new experimental data in the framework of the optical model will be presented .",
    "our analysis is extended up to e@xmath3 = 27 mev by taking into account the elastic scattering angular distributions from @xcite .",
    "the optical model potential combines a coulomb term with the complex form of the nuclear potential , which consists of a real and an imaginary part . usually , the parameters of the optical potential are derived from the analysis of the angular distributions of elastically scattered alpha particles and are adjusted to experimental @xmath2-induced cross sections if they are known .",

    "a local optical potential is tailored to describe the experimental data of a small region of the mass range , i.e. , it is a potential with parameters derived from the data of a few alpha elastic angular distributions or even from just a single experiment .",

    "there are two reasons for this unexpected large @xmath61 .",
    "first , the absolute values of the notre dame data @xcite have been normalized to rutherford scattering ( @xmath62 ) at the most forward experimental angle .",
    "however , this procedure is not justified at the higher energies .",
    "we have allowed to vary the absolute normalization of these angular distributions , leading to @xmath60 which are about a factor of two smaller than the ones using the original normalization .",

    "low - energy @xmath2-induced cross sections we have chosen an average potential from all angular distributions below 21.2mev which can be described using a pure surface woods - saxon imaginary potential .",
    "these average values are practically insensitive to the modified normalization of the notre dame data @xcite because the strongly affected data at 23.6 mev and 26.0mev do not contribute here ( the additional volume woods - saxon imaginary potential complicates the extrapolation to low energies ) .",

    "are present either in the entrance or in the exit channel .",
    "experimentally , most of these reactions are inaccessible for cross section measurements , since short - lived unstable nuclei are involved in the entrance channel .",
    "therefore , global @xmath2 + nucleus optical potentials are used in the reaction network to predict the needed reaction rates .    the variation of the potential parameters of the real part as a function of mass and energy is smooth and relatively well understood . on the contrary ,",
    "the imaginary part of the optical potential is strongly energy - dependent especially at energies around the coulomb barrier . as a result of these different energy dependencies of the parameterizations ,",

    "in particular , this model has been widely applied for the calculation of reaction cross sections and stellar reaction rates in nuclear astrophysics @xcite . in a schematic notation ,",
    "the reaction cross section in the stm is proportional to @xmath86 with the transmission coefficients @xmath87 into the @xmath88-th open channel .",
    "the @xmath87 are calculated from global optical potentials ( particle channels ) and from the @xmath4-ray strength function for the photon channel . for details of the definition of @xmath87 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xmath89 refers to the entrance channel where the target nucleus is in its ground state .",
    "note that this holds only for laboratory experiments ; under stellar conditions , i.e. ,  for the calculation of stellar reaction rates @xmath90 , thermal excitations of the target have to be considered .",
    "it is typical for @xmath2-induced reactions on heavy nuclei that @xmath91 is much smaller than the other @xmath87 .",
    "a simple qualitative explanation is the high coulomb barrier in the @xmath2  channel . in the neutron channel ,",
    "a coulomb barrier is completely missing and , in the proton channel , the barrier is much lower . as a consequence , the cross section in the stm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stm ] ) factorizes into a production cross section of the compound nucleus which is proportional to @xmath89 , and a decay branching ratio @xmath92 practically independent of @xmath93 .",
    "the production cross section is thus entirely defined by the chosen @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential whereas the branching ratio @xmath94 depends practically not on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential but on all the other ingredients of the stm ( optical potentials for the other channels , @xmath4-ray strength functions , level densities ) .",
    "consequently , all cross sections of @xmath2-induced reactions are sensitive to the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential , but each individual ( @xmath95 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , or ( @xmath17 )  reaction has further and complicated sensitivities to the other ingredients . as the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential affects directly the production cross section ,",
    "the sensitivity ( as defined e.g.  in @xcite ) is close to 1 for all ( @xmath2,@xmath97 ) reactions at energies around or below the coulomb barrier .",
    "the reaction @xmath98-values for @xmath2-induced reactions on @xmath0cd  are @xmath99mev for the ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath100mev for the ( @xmath95 ) , and @xmath101mev for the ( @xmath17 )  reactions .",
    "experimental data for these reactions are available at low energies from about 7mev to 13mev @xcite . following the above argumentation",
    ", it can be expected that the ( @xmath96 )  cross section is dominating at higher energies down to close above the ( @xmath96 )  threshold .",
    "below 10mev , only the ( @xmath95 )  and ( @xmath17 )  channels are open , and it turns out that the ( @xmath95 )  channel becomes very weak towards lower energies .",
    "the focus of the present study is the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential for @xmath0cd  which determines the compound formation cross section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] , we show the formation cross section taken as the sum over the dominating ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , and ( @xmath95 )  channels for the potentials under study in this work . obviously , the calculated compound formation cross section should be an upper envelope of the experimental ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , and ( @xmath95 )  data . at higher energies above about 13mev , all potentials lead to very similar cross sections .",
    "this is a general finding which has been explained from the properties of reflexion coefficients @xmath102 , see @xcite .",
    "however , at lower energies , significant differences can be seen .",
    "the local potential which has been adjusted to the elastic scattering angular distibutions overestimates the experimental data at energies below about 10mev .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to determine the energy dependence of the imaginary part from elastic scattering and , therefore , the local potential behaves similar to the widely used potential by mcfadden and satchler @xcite which has also been determined from elastic scattering at higher energies and also has an energy - independent imaginary part .",
    "the reaction cross sections from the mcfadden / satcher potential have already been shown in @xcite .",
    "the new atomki - v1 potential uses a very similar parametrization as the local potential , but it has an energy - dependent imaginary part in addition .",
    "the decreasing imaginary strength towards lower energies leads to smaller cross sections , but the calculation still overestimates the experimental data . on the contrary , the potential by avrigeanu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite underestimates the data .",
    "the latest revision of this potential @xcite has a slightly stronger imaginary part at very low energies which leads to slightly larger cross sections by about 10% below 10mev .",
    "let us now turn to the individual ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , and ( @xmath95 )  reactions .",
    "as already stated above , these cross sections depend not only on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential with sensitivity @xmath103 as defined in @xcite , but also on the further ingredients of the stm with varying energy - dependent sensitivities @xmath104 .",
    "this complicates the comparison of the results of the stm with the experimental data .",
    "the following calculations are the results from smaragd code @xcite with its default parameters . following the scope of this study , only the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential has been varied .",
    "[ fig:106cd_ag_others ] shows the astrophysical s factors of the @xmath0cd(@xmath17)@xmath105sn  reaction which dominates below 10mev . here",
    "the ( @xmath17 )  cross section is essentially defined by the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential .",
    "similar to the compound formation cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] , the local potential overestimates the low - energy data significantly , the atomki - v1 potential slightly overestimates , and the potential by avrigeanu _",
    "et al . _  slightly underestimates . at higher energies above the neutron threshold ,",
    "the cross sections become @xmath106 with @xmath107 and , thus , no direct conclusion on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential is possible here . as a word of caution , it must be mentioned that the behavior of the ( @xmath17 )  cross section at low energies may also be affected by direct reactions , in particular , coulomb excitation of the first @xmath108 state in @xmath0cd  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:106cd_an_others ] shows the same comparison for the @xmath0cd(@xmath96)@xmath109sn  reaction . at energies sufficiently above the threshold ,",
    "cross sections become the @xmath110 for @xmath107 . in principle , it would be possible to derive properties of the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential from these data ; however , the experimental data cover only a narrow energy interval of about 2mev from 10mev to 12mev , and the error bars are not sufficiently small to allow clear conclusions .",
    "[ fig:106cd_ap_others ] shows the astrophysical s factors of the @xmath0cd(@xmath95)@xmath109 in  reaction .",
    "similar to the ( @xmath96 )  data , the energy range is also very limited ( 9mev - 10mev ) .",
    "as the cross section becomes @xmath111 in the energy range of the experimental data , it is not possible to directly conclude on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential from these data .    for completeness",
    "it should be mentioned here that the study of cross section ratios like , e.g.  @xmath112 allows to constrain the other ingredients of the stm except the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential . for an application of this idea , see e.g.  @xcite . as we have seen ( and has been stated in our earlier study of the reaction data @xcite ) ,",
    "it is not straightforward to draw conclusions on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential from the cross sections of the ( @xmath17 ) , ( @xmath96 ) , and ( @xmath95 )  reactions .",
    "we have measured three angular distributions of @xmath0cd(@xmath1)@xmath0cd  elastic scattering at energies around the coulomb barrier ; and we have analyzed these data and data from the literature @xcite within the optical model .",
    "reasonable descriptions can be obtained for all data using a real folding potential with two adjustable parameters ( strength @xmath44 and width @xmath45 ) and an imaginary part of woods - saxon type .",
    "similar to previous results @xcite , at low energies , a surface woods - saxon type parametrization is sufficient , whereas at higher energies a combination of volume and surface imaginary part improves the obtained @xmath43 significantly .",
    "a local potential is derived from the average parameters .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible to determine the energy dependence of the imaginary part at low energies .",
    "the new experimental data are also described very reasonably by the recent global potentials @xcite , whereas the old mcfadden / satchler potential @xcite has a trend to overestimate the elastic data .    the locally adjusted potential and the global potentials by avrigeanu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and atomki - v1 @xcite were used to calculate the cross sections of @xmath2-induced reactions on @xmath0cd .",
    "it is shown that these cross sections factorize into a compound production cross section which depends only on the chosen @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential and into a decay branching which is practically independent of the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential but shows a complicated dependence on the other ingredients of the stm . therefore ,",
    "clear conclusions on the @xmath2 + nucleus optical potential from @xmath2-induced reaction data are difficult in the case of @xmath0cd .",
    "nevertheless , some conclusions can be drawn .",
    "it turns out that the locally adjusted potential overestimates the reaction data at low energies .",
    "this result is similar to the one obtained with the widely used mcfadden / satchler potential and can be attributed to the missing energy dependence of the imaginary part .",
    "the predictions from the new global potentials @xcite are much closer to the experimental data @xcite but still far from an excellent description with @xmath63 .",
    "the atomki - v1 potential @xcite slightly overestimates the reaction data at low energies whereas the potential by avrigeanu _ et al . _",
    "underestimates the data .",
    "as similar results have been found for @xmath113ce and @xmath68pr , the best prediction of @xmath2-induced reaction cross sections in the mass range @xmath114 could be taken from the geometric mean of these recent global potentials .",
