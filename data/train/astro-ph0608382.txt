    "groups and clusters of galaxies are the most massive , dynamically relaxed objects in the universe .",
    "past studies have focused on low to moderate redshifts ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) due to the lack of reliable samples at high redshift .",
    "recently , progress has been made in finding high-@xmath6 clusters and groups , largely due to improved detection techniques and greater instrument sensitivities over large fields .",
    "for instance , the method of observing red sequence galaxies has proven to be efficient in identifying clusters with optical / near - ir imaging data ( e.g. , @xcite ) . also , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton have started to reveal x - ray clusters at redshift around unity ( e.g.,@xcite ) . however , until now , no optically selected , spectroscopic sample has existed with sufficient size , sampling density , and redshift accuracy to identify large numbers of groups and clusters at @xmath7 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite has provided the first large spectroscopic galaxy catalog focused on @xmath8 , based on observations of @xmath9 galaxies .",
    "one of its four survey fields incorporates the extended groth strip ( egs ) , which is the target of a multiwavelength survey called `` all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey '' ( aegis ; @xcite ) .",
    "deep2 has produced the largest well - defined , spectroscopically selected sample of clusters and groups at high @xmath6 yet @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we investigate the x - ray properties of the deep2 groups and clusters which overlap an archival 200 @xmath0 _ chandra _ observation .",
    "the primary goal is to understand the relation between optical and x - ray properties of these systems at @xmath10 . at low @xmath6 ,",
    "simple scaling relations between x - ray quantities such as bolometric luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and temperature ( @xmath11 ) and optical quantities such as galaxy velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) have been predicted and well studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , high-@xmath6 observations reveal a different trend : optically selected galaxy clusters tend to be less x - ray luminous than those with similar velocity dispersions at low redshifts ( @xcite ) , while the x - ray selected samples tend to follow the local @xmath3@xmath4 relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the exact reason for the break - down of the @xmath3@xmath4 relation is still unclear .",
    "while previous studies of optical - x - ray relations have been limited only to a few large clusters , deep2 allows us to identify both clusters and groups at @xmath5 .",
    "the ao3 _ chandra _ observation of the groth - westphal strip ( gws ) , a subset of egs , was taken on august 2002 ( see @xcite for observation details ) .",
    "this observation was taken using the imaging mode of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) , which utilizes four ccd chips with a total field of view of @xmath12 .",
    "a total of @xmath13 exposure time was obtained over three separate observations , with ids of # 3305 ( 30 @xmath0 ) , # 4357 ( 85 @xmath0 ) and # 4365 ( 85 @xmath0 ) .",
    "each observation was processed with the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package version 3.2 . specifically , we first identified and rejected hot pixel and afterglow events in the level 1 events file to create a new level 2 events file , using the ciao tool `` acis_run_hotpix '' .",
    "we also removed bad pixels using observation - specific bad pixel files , selecting events with standard grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , only , and cleaned the dataset of periods of anomalous background levels caused by strong background flares .",
    "the final level 2 events file was created by co - adding the three observations .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows a true - color image of the _ chandra _ acis - i field after correction by exposure maps .",
    "the image is color - coded so that photons with energies at 0.54  2.05 kev , 2.05  3.50 kev , and 3.50  7.00 kev are shown as red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "we applied the voronoi tessellation and percolation ( vtp ) algorithm @xcite to detection sources , using the _ chandra _ tool `` vtpdetect '' . while the vtp algorithm can be slow for large numbers of photons",
    ", it does have the advantage of finding faint , low surface - brightness features .",
    "we required that all detected sources should have at least 40 net photons , and set the maximum probability of being a false source to be @xmath14 .",
    "we searched for potentially extended sources in three bands using vtp .",
    "this search algorithm yielded a total of 65 sources in the full band ( 0.5  7 kev ) , 45 in the soft band ( 0.5  2 kev ) , and 29 in the hard band ( 2  7 kev ) .",
    "the region corresponding to each detected source is represented by an ellipse with a semi - major axis of @xmath15 and a semi - minor axis @xmath16 .    to examine whether these sources are truly extended , we compared the size of the output ellipses with the size of instrument point spread function ( psf ) at their corresponding off - axis angles .",
    "we computed the psf using the marx simulator .",
    "specifically , single - energy photons at 1.5 kev were injected at different off - axis angles from the aim - point of acis - i , and then encircled energies at various percentage levels are calculated .",
    "we find that most sources have sizes from vpf smaller than the 95% encircled radius , indicating that they are indeed point sources .",
    "the only exception is source a at ( ra , dec)=(14:18:21.832 , + 52:26:5 ) ( j2000 ) , which is nearly twice as large as its predicted 95% radius and is designated by the white box in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "visual inspection of this source in the exposure - corrected map shows that it indeed appears extended , although we can not exclude the possibility that it is a mix of 2  3 faint point sources .",
    "the significance of the detection is @xmath17 . assuming the emission is from a weak extended source",
    ", we extracted the spectrum and fit it using the `` apec '' thermal emission model with the software package xspec v12.0 .",
    "we fixed the neutral hydrogen absorption at the galactic level , and assumed an abundance of 0.3 solar  the abundance that is typically found in the local galaxy groups and clusters . due to the very limited number of net counts ( @xmath18 75 photons in the encircled region )",
    ", we can not constrain the temperature . fixing it at 1 kev",
    ", we obtain a soft band absorbed flux ( 0.5  2 kev ) of @xmath19 .",
    "details of the deep2 group sample and group finding methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize information that is relevant to this _",
    "letter_. groups were identified using the voronoi - delaunay method ( vdm , @xcite ) . to insure a uniform group sample",
    ", we trimmed the deep2 sample in egs to match the target selection rate and color cut used to select galaxies at @xmath10 in the remaining deep2 fields .",
    "the group finding algorithm has been optimized using the mock catalogs presented in @xcite .",
    "we measure galaxy velocity dispersions in these groups using the `` gapper '' estimator ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the sample used in this paper ,",
    "we require a minimum velocity dispersion of 300 @xmath20 , above which the group velocity function is recovered well in mock catalogs @xcite .",
    "this velocity dispersion cutoff roughly corresponds to a virialized halo mass of @xmath21 at @xmath5 with our adopted cosmology.cdm cosmological model with a matter density of @xmath22 and a cosmological constant of @xmath23 , and a hubble constant of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "] we also require systems to have more than two member galaxies ( @xmath26 ) . while in general errors on the measured velocity dispersion",
    "could be quite large for systems with small @xmath27 ( see discussion in   5 ) , we find that such errors are too large to have any constraining power at all when @xmath28 . with these cuts ,",
    "we find a total of 7 groups and clusters in the deep2 data overlapping the _ chandra _ pointing , with redshifts @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ f1 ] we show the positions of the deep2 systems as white circles , with center indicating the mean position of member galaxies and radius 30",
    ". this radius roughly corresponds to a physical distance of @xmath29 kpc , a typical core radius for galaxy groups and clusters at high redshift .",
    "none of the deep2 groups was detected directly by vpf . however",
    ", we can place upper limits on their x - ray luminosity .",
    "using poisson statistics , we estimate the 3@xmath2 fluctuation in the x - ray background within a 30radius aperture and take this as a 3@xmath2 upper limit on the x - ray photon counts from each system . assuming thermal bremsstrahlung radiation",
    ", we can then convert photon counts to flux using pimms . to obtain flux",
    ", we also need a temperature estimate . here",
    "we assume these systems follow the local , well - calibrated @xmath31 relationship ( see , e.g. , xue & wu  2000 ) .",
    "while as @xcite reported , the high - z clusters are generally cooler , we found that for fixed photon counts , x - ray flux is not a very sensitive function of temperature : by lowering the temperature by a factor of 5 , the flux varies by less than 20% . knowing flux and redshift",
    ", we can then obtain the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of each galaxy group .",
    "upper limits on @xmath3 for the deep2 systems , with their mean @xmath32 @xmath4 uncertainty shown by the error bar at the bottom right .",
    "the size of each circle is proportional to the system richness , ranging from @xmath33 to 6 .",
    "the horizontal dashed green line indicates the @xmath34 upper limit from the stacked data .",
    "the solid dark line shows the local relation from @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath6 ( @xmath35 ) x - ray selected clusters ( black circles with error bars ) are taken from @xcite . optically selected clusters are taken from @xcite ( blue circles with error bars ) and @xcite ( open blue circle with arrow ) . ]    in figure  [ f2 ] we plot the bolometric x - ray luminosity as a function of velocity dispersion .",
    "the filled red circles are the 3@xmath2 upper limits on @xmath3 for the deep2 systems .",
    "the size of the circles is proportional to @xmath27 , i.e. , the smallest circle corresponds to 3 members , and the largest corresponds to 6 members .",
    "we compute @xmath4 errors by using monte - carlo realizations to obtain the distribution of true dispersions , given a richness and a dispersion measured with the `` gapper '' estimator ; the mean uncertainty for the systems considered here is shown by the horizontal error bar at the bottom right of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the dark line in figure  [ f2 ] is the local @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath2 relation from @xcite .",
    "since deep2 systems and cluster sample in @xcite have similar @xmath4 , we use their relation @xmath36 that is appropriate for clusters of galaxies .",
    "clearly , the deep2 systems are x - ray underluminous compared to the local @xmath37 relation , and this trend is more apparent for systems with larger velocity dispersions .",
    "this result is robust to changes in the adopted system radius . by increasing the radius to @xmath38 to @xmath39 , the 3@xmath2 upper limit in @xmath3 increases by @xmath40% only .",
    "we also have stacked _ chandra _ images at their corresponding deep2 system positions to see whether we can find enhanced x - ray emission .",
    "the stacked image is consistent with background emission and provides a stronger constraint on the upper limit of @xmath3 ( shown by the dashed green line in figure  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "we overplot results from previous observations in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "x - ray selected clusters are plotted in black and optically selected clusters are plotted in blue .",
    "the open blue circle with an upper limit is taken from the @xmath41 ms observation in the _ chandra _ deep field north @xcite , in which an optically identified cluster at @xmath42 was not detected in x - ray .",
    "it is quite clear that at high-@xmath6 , while optically selected clusters are x - ray underluminous , x - ray selected systems more or less follow the local @xmath30 relation .      how well does the measured @xmath4 reflect the dynamic state of high-@xmath6 galaxy clusters and groups ?",
    "a recent weak - lensing measurement of the optically selected cluster cl  1604 + 4304 at @xmath43 shows that galaxies are indeed good tracers of the dark matter , at least in this system @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath4 measurements will tend to be higher than the the velocity dispersion of the dark matter ( @xmath44 ) due to an eddington - like bias : low-@xmath44 groups are much more common than high-@xmath44 ones , so given the large velocity dispersion errors when @xmath27 is small , it is more likely that a system above our velocity dispersion cutoff limit has a @xmath4 which was scattered up from its true @xmath44 value than one which was scattered down .    to test this ,",
    "we have looked at systems in the deep2 mock catalogs @xcite with @xmath45 . in figure",
    "[ f3 ] , we plot the total mass within an overdensity of @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , top panel ) and dark matter velocity dispersion ( @xmath44 , bottom panel ) as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , a bias exists at high @xmath4 end : for the same system @xmath4 tends to be higher than @xmath44 , and the system mass inferred from @xmath4 is overestimated .",
    "such bias typically is not seen at low redshift . at low @xmath6 ,",
    "simulations show that @xmath4 in general follows @xmath44 quite well , although some bias does exist at @xmath1810% level for systems with less than 10 member galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    while this bias can partly explain why the deep2 systems are x - ray faint , it is unlikely that the non - detection of x - ray emission from all seven systems is caused by this effect . based on the 3@xmath2 luminosity limit calculated in @xmath48",
    ", non - detection would require that all seven systems have @xmath49 if the local @xmath50 relation applies .",
    "we have performed a monte - carlo test by taking random sets of seven systems with measured velocity dispersions @xmath51 in the mock catalog , and determine the chance that none of those systems have @xmath52 is only 0.14% .",
    "so with @xmath53 confidence the deep2 systems must be x - ray underluminous .    , top panel ) and dark matter velocity dispersion ( @xmath44 , bottom panel ) as a function of galaxy velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the red lines in the top and bottom panels represent the theoretical prediction of @xmath47 vs. @xmath4 @xcite , and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "blue crosses are systems identified in the mock catalogs of @xcite , and the open squares with error bars indicate the medians and standard error of @xmath47 or @xmath44 for equal - size bins in @xmath55 , with a bin size of 0.1 . ]",
    "in this @xmath56 , we find evidence that spectroscopically selected galaxy groups and clusters at high redshift are x - ray underluminous ; i.e. , the upper limits of their x - ray luminosities are significantly below predictions from the local @xmath37 relation , unlike x - ray selected clusters at these redshifts .",
    "this confirms previous results showing that optically selected clusters at high @xmath6 are weak x - ray sources .",
    "while bias in the @xmath4 measurement may contribute partly to the non - detection , it is unlikely to be the sole explanation .",
    "physically , there are two basic reasons why spectroscopically selected systems at @xmath8 might fall below the @xmath37 relation followed by x - ray selected clusters at these redshifts .",
    "the first is that the deep2 systems may be dynamically younger objects than those clusters which are easily detected in the x - ray .",
    "if the deep2 systems are are not yet fully virialized , their gas may tend to be in cooler subclumps rather than at the temperature predicted from spherical - collapse models , and their galaxy velocity distribution may be multimodal rather than gaussian , increasing the measured @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative is that these galaxy groups and clusters may be deficient in the hot gas that is necessary to produce detectable x - ray emission .",
    "deep2 systems do appear to be generally above the threshold mass beyond which cooling is predicted to be inefficient and a hot atmosphere forms ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , they may have passed that threshold only relatively recently in their history and may still be in the process of building a hot halo of substance . in this case",
    "@xmath3 would be expected to remain low until a sufficient amount of hot gas had been accreted .",
    "we note that the average blue galaxy fraction is higher in deep2 groups than in local systems , reflecting the more common presence of the cold gas which feeds star formation @xcite .",
