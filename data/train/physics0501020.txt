    "the instabilities of a plasma embedded in a confining magnetic field ( _ e.g. _ experimental fusion devices , like tokamak ) evolve in a geometry that is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the motion of the electrons along the magnetic field lines is in many cases sufficiently fast to produce a density perturbation that has the boltzmann distribution in the electric potential . in these cases",
    "a two dimensional approximation ( the dynamical equations are written in the plane that is transversal to the magnetic field ) may be satisfactory .",
    "the boltzmann electron distribution suppresses the convective nonlinearity , leaving the ion polarization drift as the essential nonlinearity .",
    "this is of high differential degree ( therefore it is enhanced at small spatial scales ) and basically describes the advection of the fluctuating vorticity by the velocity fluctuations .",
    "the differential equation for the electrostatic potential has been derived by hasegawa and mima @xcite .",
    "a similar situation appears in the physics of the atmosphere and the differential equation for the streamfunction of the velocity field has been derived by charney @xcite .",
    "many plasma instabilities ( in particular in tokamak ) depend on this nonlinear term and will likely show some common aspects . in numerical simulations of the charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm )",
    "equation it has been proved that the plasma is evolving at large times ( in the absence of external driving forces and starting from an irregular flow pattern ) to states that are characterised by a regular form of the potential .",
    "the evolution toward a very regular pattern of vortical flow is also characteristic to the incompressible ideal fluid , described by the euler equation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this case",
    "the time - asymptotic states consists of few vortices , of regular shape , with very slow motion .",
    "the streamfunction obeys , in these states , the _ sinh_-poisson equation . in the case of chm equation",
    ", the cuasi - stationary states also consist of structures but it has not been possible to derive an equation for the streamfunction @xcite .",
    "there are seveal studies of the chm ( or very similar ) equations showing that at large time the flow is strongly organized and dominated by structures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and references therein ) . at the oposite",
    "limit the turbulent regime can be treated with renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the problem exclusively in terms of experimentally - accessible quantities , velocity and vorticity seems to not allow too much freedom in elaborating a theoretical model from which the stationary states to be determined . in all our considerations we will be guided by the analogous experience in the case of the euler fluid . in that case",
    "the existence of a parallel formulation ( although the mathematical equivalence is still not fully proven ) has been decissive .",
    "that model consists of the discrete set of point - like vortices evolving in plane due to a potential given as the natural logarithm of the relative distance .",
    "comparing with the differential equation of the euler fluid this alternative formulation provides something fundamentally new : it splits the dynamics into two objects of distinct nature : point - like vortices and potential , or , in other words , matter and field carrying the interaction .",
    "going along this model we are led to consider the standard treatment in these cases .",
    "we must assume that each of these objects can evolve freely ( _ i.e. _ independent of the other ) and in addition there is an interaction between them .",
    "this formulation is standard in electrodynamics ( classical or quantum ) .",
    "going to continuum , the discrete set of point - like vortices becomes a field of `` matter '' ( which must be assumed in general complex ) , the potential will be a free field ( called `` gauge '' , similar with the free electromagnetic field ) and , in addition , there is the interaction between the matter and the gauge fields ( similar to the classical @xmath0 charge - field interaction ) .",
    "basic properties of the original , _ i.e. _ physical , model impose constraints to this field - theoretical formulation .",
    "the presence of vorticity requires a particular form of the potential between discrete vortices : it is the _ curl _ of a sum of natural logarithms .",
    "this can only be derived from a gauge - field lagrangean density of chern - simons type , instead of maxwell type .",
    "therefore the field - theoretical model will contain the chern - simons lagrangean .",
    "the matter field has a nonlinear self - interaction that reflects the stationary structure of the free matter field .",
    "the coupling of the two fields ( the interaction ) is minimal , via the covariant derivatives . in a previous work we have formulated this model and",
    "have obtained , in this way , a purely analytic derivation of the _ sinh_-poisson equation for the euler fluid @xcite .",
    "this paper will develop a model for the charney - hasegawa - mima equation along the same lines .",
    "however several differences will impose new features of the model .",
    "in a previous work @xcite we have investigated a model based on the similarity with the superfluid field theory , the abelian - higgs model .",
    "this is able to describe _ positive _ fluid vortices .",
    "we have also proposed , without details , a more extended model , which seemed able to describe the physical vortices of plasma and atmosphere within the regime of the chm equation .",
    "the full development of this model is the main objective of the present work .",
    "the analytical model we develop in the present work is intended to describe a system characterized by the following elements :    1 .",
    "the existence of an intrinsic length ; this is the larmor radius @xmath1 for the two - dimensional plasma immersed in a strong , confining , transversal magnetic field ; and the rossby radius for the two - dimensional quasi - geostrophical approximation of the planetary atmosphere ; 2 .   the existence of a condensate of vorticity as a background in the system , in the absence of any perturbation .",
    "this background consists of the cyclotronic gyration of ions , for the plasma ; and of the coriolis effect resulting from the planetary rotation , for the atmosphere .",
    "these basic elements are very general and other systems belong to the class that is defined by them . in particular the non - neutral plasma produced in laboratory experiments and the vortices produced on a fluid in a rotating tank ( see schecter , nezlin , hopfinger and van heijst , etc . )    to make the discussion more specific we will refer in the following to the physical model developed for the two - dimensional plasma and atmosphere , which leads to the equation of charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) : @xmath2 \\mathbf{\\nabla } _ { \\perp } ^{2}\\phi = 0   \\label{cce}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 .",
    "for simplicity we will refer to the problem of plasma physics , the adaptation to the problem in the physics of atmosphere being easily done ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities appearing in the eq.([cce ] ) are the _ physical _ ones after having been normalized : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the derivation of the equation , in the drift instability in tokamaks is done in the appendix a.    for comparison , the euler equation is @xmath8 \\mathbf{\\nabla } _ { \\perp } ^{2}\\phi & = & 0   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the _",
    "streamfunction_.    the similarity between the two equation , eq.([cce ] ) and eq.([eulereq ] ) is apparent .",
    "however , with regard to the form and properties of the stationary states of the two equations we should not attempt of simply taking any previous conclusion derived from the euler fluid context into the chm context .",
    "this is because the naive stationarity @xmath10 imposed in the two equations leads to an equation with a vast degree of generality and does not provide , by itself , a clear identification of the final vortex shapes .",
    "we may represent the family of all possible solutions of the naive stationary limit as a subset in a function space . in the time evolution",
    "the two equations produces two series of configurations representing functions belonging to two distinct paths , ending in this set at distinct points ( _ i.e. _ configurations ) .",
    "compared with the equation for the ideal fluid ( euler equation ) the chm eq .",
    "is not scale invariant @xcite . to see this",
    "we make the rescaling of the space variables @xmath11 expressing the euler equation in the new variables , we have @xmath12 \\mathbf{\\nabla } _ { \\perp } ^{\\prime 2}\\phi = 0\\ ] ] the factor @xmath13 can be absorbed in a rescaling of the time variable and the equation preserves its form . by contrast",
    "the equation chm becomes ( for simplicity we take @xmath14 ) @xmath15 \\mathbf{\\nabla } _ { \\perp } ^{\\prime 2}\\phi = 0\\ ] ] while the factor @xmath16 can be absorbed by time rescaling , the factor @xmath13 in the first paranthesis can not be absorbed .",
    "the form of the equation is invariant only for @xmath17 which means the space is measured in units of @xmath18 .",
    "the equation chm exhibits an intrinsic spatial scale , which is @xmath18 .",
    "in the case of the euler fluid , there is an equivalent model whose dynamical evolution is considered to be identical with that of the physical system ( for a list of references , see @xcite ) .",
    "it consists of a collection of discrete point - like vortices in two - dimensions evolving from mutual interaction defined in terms of a potential .",
    "the potential is the natural logarithm of the relative distance of two vortices .",
    "this model has been proposed and used long ago ( kirchoff , onsager , etc . ) but the rigurous proof of the equivalence between it and the physical euler description is a difficult mathematical problem @xcite .    for the chm equation there is a similar model : a collection of point - like vortices interacting by a potential that has a short range .",
    "this model has been proposed in meteorology by morikawa @xcite and stewart @xcite ( see horton and hasegawa @xcite ) . for a set of @xmath19 vortices with strength @xmath20 , @xmath21 with instantaneous positions @xmath22 the streamfunction @xmath23 has the following expression @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant .",
    "the differential equation from which the contributions to the streamfunction @xmath26 in eq.([phik0 ] ) are derived , is @xmath27 in two dimensions . for a single vortex of strength @xmath28 placed in the origin ,",
    "the azimuthal component of the velocity can be derived from the streamfunction @xmath29@xmath30 at small distances @xmath31 which is the same as for the euler case , where @xmath32 is given by the natural logarithm .",
    "the streamfunction decays fast at large @xmath33 since the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath34 decays exponentially at large argument @xmath35 this means that the vortices are shielded .",
    "the elementary vortex of the charney - hasegawa - mima equation is localised by @xmath36 and one can associate a finite spatial extension to it , @xmath18 in plasma physics , @xmath37 in the physics of atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the vortex @xmath38 at @xmath39 under the effect of the others are @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 this is the kirchhoff function for the system of interacting point - like vortices in plane .",
    "it is the hamiltonian for the system of @xmath19 vortices .",
    "if we introduce the versor of the normal to the plane , @xmath42 , the equations can be expressed @xmath43    we will develop a formalism for this discrete system which in the continuum becomes a field theory .",
    "we will develop a continuum model whose equations of motion could reproduce , in the discrete approximation , the eqs.([phik0 ] ) , ( [ eqmot ] ) and the energy ( [ w ] ) . the model must be defined in terms of a lagrangean density for two interacting fields :    * the field associated with the density of point - like vortices @xmath44 ; we will call it the _ matter _ ( or _ scalar _ , or _ higgs _ ) field ; and * the field associated with the potential carrying the interaction between the vortices ; we will call it the _ gauge _ field .",
    "we note that the interaction potential @xmath45 ( assume that @xmath25 is normalised as @xmath46 ) appearing in the discrete model proposed in meteorology is similar to the potential appearing in the euler problem , @xmath47 in the following sense : they both have topological properties , in sense to be explained . for the euler equation",
    ", the potential can be represented using the angle made by the line connecting the reference ( @xmath48 ) and the current ( @xmath49 ) points with a fixed line , and in order to remove the multivaluedness one has to make a cut in the plane from the center  ( where is singular ) to infinity @xcite .",
    "@xmath50 ( here @xmath51 , @xmath52 label the point - like vortices and @xmath53 , @xmath54 label the coordinates of the position vectors , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "since @xmath57 we see that the potential in eq.([12 ] ) is expressed through the green function of the @xmath58 laplacian , defined by the equation @xmath59 the potential is obtained by applying the rotational operator @xmath60 on this green function .",
    "the chm case is similar , with the difference that the @xmath61 is the green function of the helmholtz operator , as results from eq.([kgreen ] ) .",
    "the series representation of the function @xmath34 is @xmath62 we see that close to the origin the two potentials are similar @xmath63    we note that the potential in the euler fluid case may be presented as a singular _ pure gauge _",
    "@xcite : @xmath64 the individual contributions to the potential are the derivatives of the angle @xmath65 made by the particle position vector with an arbitrary fixed direction in plane . in the case of the chm equation",
    "we have from eqs.([phik0 ] ) , ( [ eqmot ] ) , ( [ kgreen ] ) @xmath66   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the small argument expansion ( see formula 8.446 in @xcite or , alternatively , the eq.([1408 ] ) ) @xmath67 we note that eq.([16 ] ) can be written like eq.([angle ] ) .",
    "the function in the right paranthesis only changes the spatial decay .",
    "the angle @xmath68 is a ( multivalued ) scalar function and we have in both cases a typical situation of the type @xmath69 so that the potential can be considered at large distances a pure gauge @xmath70 with @xmath71 _ i.e. _ @xmath72 . in other words , for every point @xmath73 on a large circle on the plane , we have a value of the angle @xmath65 .",
    "these potentials have therefore a _ topological _ nature , since they map the circle at infinity in @xmath58 , ( @xmath74 ) onto the set of values of the angle @xmath75 , which is also a circle .",
    "this is a typical homotopic classification of states and the potentials @xmath9 are classified into distinct sets characterised by an integer , representing how many times the circle in the plane is covered by the circle representing the values of @xmath65 .    the main difference between the euler and the chm cases is the short range of the potential in the latter case .",
    "if we use formally the concept of photon ( a `` particle '' that mediates the gauge interaction as in electrodynamics ) , one can say that in the euler case we have the usual ( two dimensional ) _ massless photon _ , whereas in the chm case we have a _ massive photon_. the fact that the photon is massive is another way to express the fast spatial decay of the potential function , _",
    "i.e. _ the short range and we will often use this formulation . from physical reasons",
    "we know that this short spacial range must be of the order of @xmath18 , the intrinsic length in the chm equation . the need that the equations of motion lead to a short - range potential ( finite - mass photon ) and that the potential has a topological nature represent constraints for the part of the lagrangean density coming from the gauge field .",
    "as we have shown in the case of euler fluid @xcite , the _ topological nature _ of the potential is provided by the chern - simons ( cs ) lagrangean @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the totally antisymmetric tensor in @xmath78 dimensions ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath79 can take three values : @xmath80 , corresponding to the time and the two coordinates @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 is a constant .",
    "this lagrangean is essentially the density of `` magnetic '' helicity .",
    "it is known that this lagrangean does not lead by itself to dynamical equations for the potential @xmath83 since it is first order in the time derivatives ; it only represents a constraint on the dynamics , analogous to the lorentz force in an external magnetic field given by the combination of @xmath82 with the other constants of the model .",
    "we can heuristically say that the chern - simons lagrangean induce vortical effects on the dynamics .",
    "this will become more clear later .",
    "the gauge field dynamics can be introduced either by coupling the chern - simons potential with the matter field , or by including the maxwell lagrangean density @xmath84 or both .",
    "we note that any of these combinations provide a finite mass for the photon but the way they do that is different .    for the combination maxwell and chern - simons , the vortical effect of the chern - simons part induces decay of the field on structures of small spatial scale , with an extension governed by the `` external magnetic field '' , @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to the gyration motion .",
    "for the combination maxwell and matter field the generation of the photon mass is due to a classical higgs mechanism .",
    "the matter field has a nonlinear self - interaction which vanishes at certain non - zero values of the field .",
    "therefore the extremum of the action implies the minimum of this self - interaction potential and the matter field will take one of these values ( called : the vacuum value ) at infinity .",
    "this is the symmetry breaking leading to the higgs mechanism .",
    "the motion of the photon in a polarisable medium consisting of this background matter density induces a finite mass effect for the photon .",
    "then the value of the mass for the photon ( the short range of the spatial decay ) is determined by this vacuum value of the matter field and by the coefficient of the maxwell contribution in the lagrangean ( the electric charge ) .",
    "the combination maxwell , chern - simons and matter has therefore two possible ways to obtain a finite mass for the photon : the gyration ( due to chern - simons ) and the higgs mechanism , due to the finite background of matter field corresponding to one of its `` vacuum '' values .",
    "there is a mixing of these two ways and there are two possible masses , or short ranges for the gauge potential . at the limit where the maxwell term is suppressed from the lagrangean",
    ", the short range of chern - simons with matter is recovered .",
    "we argue that including the maxwell term is not necessary in our model describing the flow governed by the chm equation .",
    "this would only provide for the gauge field an independent dynamical evolution since , even when the matter field is absent , the maxwell lagrangean leads to plane waves , _",
    "i.e. _ a propagating field , without any meaning or justification in our case .",
    "the matter field @xmath9 is associated to ( without being identical with ) the density of point - like vortices in the discrete model .",
    "the matter field must be complex since the vorticity carried by any point - like vortex appears as a sort of electrical charge ( only complex fields can represent charged particles ) .",
    "the kinematical part of the matter field in the lagrangean consists as usual in the squared momentum but with the covariant derivatives , to reflect the so - called _ minimal coupling _ with the gauge field @xmath86 where @xmath87    in the hamiltonian formulation of the discrete vortices model for the euler equation it has been derived an equation connecting the gauge field with the `` density '' of the point - like vortices . going to the continuum ( _ i.e. _ field - theoretical ) version it appeared that the only way to keep this constraint was to assume a self - interaction of the matter field .",
    "the same reasons act in our present case , but now the problem is more complicated .",
    "the self - interaction potential @xmath88 must have a minimum at a nonzero value of the matter field such as to ensure the background that will induce ( together with the cs term ) the short - range of the gauge field . comparing with the euler case ( we neglect the various constant factors )",
    "@xmath89 the simplest form would be @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the vacuum value of the matter field .",
    "however , it will be shown below that this form can not provide , for the lagrangean density consisting of chern - simons and matter part , the most symmetrical extremum of the action functional for the system .",
    "this particular state is called self - duality and we adopt the point of view that this is a fundamental requirement on the model . in particular in our previous paper @xcite it was shown that the stationary states of the ideal fluid obeying the _ sinh_-poisson equation correspond to the self - duality .    in a different context @xcite , @xcite the form of the self - interaction potential able to support self - duality has been found as @xmath92 and we will work with this form .",
    "the main physical content of the states governed by the chm equation is the vorticity , which is organizing in large scale vortical structures .",
    "the vorticity and the velocity fields generate the kinematic helicity , which is a topological invariant for a dissipationless fluid / plasma .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the helicity is determined from the boundary condition ( this becomes evident in the clebsch representation of the velocity ) : the values of helicity on the boundary of the volume are sufficient to determine the value at any internal point .",
    "we understand that besides the fields defined in the internal points , we need to consider fields that carry the information from the boundary toward the interior , on equal foot with fields that carry informations from the points of the internal volume to the boundary .",
    "this _ pairing _ of functions suggests that all quantities involved in our model will be matrices .",
    "the model becomes non - abelian and the quantities are elements of the algebra of the group @xmath93 .    a more formal explanation of the necessity to adopt a non - abelian algebraic structure of the theory results from the consideration of the spinorial nature of the elementary point - like vortices and from the parity , charge conjugation and time inversion invariances of the theory .",
    "the continuum limit of the system of discrete point - like vortices is a field theory . from the discussion of the previous section",

    "we have shown how to derive two versions of writting the total energy of the system as a sum of squared terms plus an additional ( _ residual _ ) term , while this one has no topological significance .",
    "after adopting the algebraic ansatz we arrive at two different equations for the scalar function @xmath26 which we associate with the physical streamfunction of the chm fluid .    the choice of the version that has the correct physical significance should be done on the basis of the supersymmetric invariance of the extended field theoretical model . however , even from this advanced point of view , we can expect at most an indication which will not be applicable directly to our problem .",

    "the topological aspect is also lost , the additional energy , in both versions , is not proportional with the total winding number induced by the vortices present in the plane .",
    "we must note however that the point of view that results from the susy extension of the theory ( a natural extension ) favorizes the eq.([94 ] ) or possibly , as mentioned below , the abelian version , eq.([497 ] ) .",
    "this even if the additional energy does not have a topological meaning .",
    "one possible help comes from looking at the theory of the chm fluid as being a development of the theory for the euler fluid . since the asymptotic states of the latter are goverend by the _ sinh_-poisson equation , we expect that the nonlinear term of the equation for chm fluid to be of a similar nature . or , we see that the first set of sd equations leads to a sign which is opposite to the one appearing in the _ sinh_-poisson equation .",
    "the physical form and properties of the solutions would be , in that case , completely different . or",
    ", one expects that an ideal fluid without an intrinsic length will transform smootly into a fluid which has an intrinsic length , as the chm fluid .",
    "although this is not an argument , we take this as a sort of indication that the second choice is more appropriate and we adopt eq.([465 ] ) as the equation governing the asymptotic states of the chm fluid .     which is the additional term in the _ first _",

    "after adopting the algebraic ansatz , lee finds that the boundary conditions on the two functions @xmath334 and @xmath239 lead to restrictive choices : basically it results that the second ladder generator should not be present in the algebraic form of @xmath9 .",
    "then the equation resulting from the first set of sd equations is identical with the equation which is derived from the abelian version of the theory @xmath335 contrary to the equation ( [ 94 ] ) , eq.([497 ] ) has physically interesting solutions , consisting of rings of vorticity .",
    "the way this theory can arise from the _ abelian dominance _ in the full field - theoretical ( ft ) model of the chm fluid and the physical consequences of this theory will be analysed elsewhere .",
    "another possible criterion for the choice of one or another bogomolnyi form is the behavior of the additional energy . in some cases ,",
    "the solution of the equations at self - duality ( _ i.e. _ by taking to zero the squared terms ) show a higher energy due to the residual term , when compared with other choices .",

    "this consists of a basis manifold ( on which one has to define an atlas of compatible charts ) , a fiber attached to every point of the basis manifold ( in physics the fiber is seldom said space of internal symmetry ) and a group of automorphism of the typical fiber .",
    "the local structure on the basis and in the fibre space is euclidean since they both are manifolds .",
    "one can construct the total space of the fiber bundle , which is locally a cartesian product of an open set of the basis with the space of the fiber , and a projection operator acting in this total space and projecting the points of the total space onto the basis .",
    "the transition functions between neighboring charts consist of elements of the group .",
    "a connection is a differential one - form defined in every point of the total space and taking values in the algebra of the group .",

    "the connection is the _ potential _ @xmath83 and the curvature is the _ field strength _ @xmath473 like in the electromagnetism , or in any other theory expressed in similar terms .",
    "there is a hodge duality operator , denoted @xmath115 : applied on a differential @xmath365-form in a space with @xmath539 dimensions , it generates a differential @xmath540 form , such as the exterior product of these two forms produces a scalar multiplying the unique @xmath539 form that can de defined on the @xmath539-dimensional space , _ i.e. _ a multiple of the volume form .",
    "the self - duality is the property that consists of the equality between the a differential form and its hodge dual ; this naturally requires that the space be of even dimension .",
    "only the differential forms of the order representing half of the ( even ) dimension of the space can be self - dual since only in this case their duals will be of the same order .",
    "for example in a space with dimension four , differential two - forms can be self - dual .    in particular physical models",
    "the differential two - form representing the field strength and its dual are equal at self - duality .",
    "but this two - form represents the curvature of the fibre bundle , therefore at self - duality the curvature is equal to its dual . in many cases",
    ", this equality is realised by the fact that the curvature is zero and one says that the space is _",
    "when the self - duality is realised as a condition of _ flatness _ it is possible to express this equality as the compatibility condition of a system of linear differential equations .",
    "this makes possible to introduce a lax operator and the self - duality equation is exactly integrable by inverse scattering transform .",
    "a set of infinite invariants can be found .",
    "one example of this type is the classical _ sigma _ model .    in particular cases , ( like ours )",
    "the geometrical structure is less clear .",
    "the self - duality is expressed by the fact that the _ action _ functional is minimized _ i.e. _ the bogomolnyi limit is saturated .      the abelian version of this theory but with the maxwell term instead of chern - simons is well known from superconductivity theory .",
    "it implies a potential of only fourth order which provides the symmetrical vacua of the theory and allows mass generation for the maxwell photon via the higgs mechanism .",
    "however in the present theory a sixth order potential is necessary .",
    "it has been demonstrated that with only a sixth order potential one can have self - dual states .",
    "this has been shown by a simple verification which we have reproduced in the section about the energy functional related to the lagrangean density .",

    "it has been shown that the bogomolnyi lower bound for the energy and the first - order - in - time differential equations obtained at self - duality are a property of a classical field theory which possesses a topological charge .",
    "the theory is a reduction of a supersymmetric ( susy ) theory in which the topological charge appears as the central charge of the susy algebraic structure .",

    "first it is shown that any supersymmetric theory which possesses a topological charge necessarly possesses a bogomolnyi bound and sd equations of motion . then for a given field theory where a topological conservation charge exists ,",
    "it is first constructed a supersymmetric extension , adding the anti - commuting variables and other variables that are necessary to close the new algebraic structure . in this extended theory",
    "the _ central charge _ of the susy algebra is the topological charge of the initial theory .",
    "the bogomolnyi bound is identified .",

    "the relation between the potential @xmath541 in the extended theory and the potential @xmath542 in the classical non - susy theory is @xmath543 and for a symmetrical two - vacua potential @xmath541 we have a potential @xmath542 of sixth degree in @xmath544 .",
    "lee , lee and weinberg @xcite show explicitly in an abelian case how this form of the potential is obtained from the requirement that the model can be extended to a @xmath545 supersymmetric model .",
    "they begin by constructing an @xmath546 supersymmetric generalization of this chern - simons higgs theory , in which the form of the potential @xmath547 is not yet specified . adding a single pair of grassmannian varibales @xmath548 to the set of variables of the original model requires to extend the model by introducing additional fields .",
    "this is necessary since the supersymmetry transformation must be closed and the original fields are not sufficient .",

    "<S> versions of this field theory are discussed and  we find arguments in favor of a particular form of the equation . </S>",
    "<S> we comment upon the significant difference between the chm fluid / plasma and the euler fluid and respectively the abelian - higgs vortex models . </S>"
