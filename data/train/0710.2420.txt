    "graphene is a monolayer of graphite with a band structure composed of two cones located at two inequivalent corners * k * and * k * of the brillouin zone at which conduction and valence bands merge .",
    "this compound has recently received a large attention because of the unusual sequence of quantum hall states it reveals @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( c2deg ) which display a quadratic dispersion law , graphene exhibits a linear dispersion law @xmath1 as a function of the momentum @xmath2 leading to a dirac s type hamiltonian with a fermi velocity @xmath3 replacing that of the light .",
    "different one - electron band structure models , not including electron - electron interactions , lead to values @xmath4 with some variance , but this is the value which will adopted in this report .",
    "this peculiar dispersion law has two important consequences in contrast to c2deg ( see for instance @xcite ) : ( i ) the wave functions have a spinor type character and ( ii ) under a magnetic field * b * applied perpendicular to the graphene plane , the dirac energy spectrum evolves into landau levels ( ll ) with energies given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 scans all positive and negative integer values including zero .",
    "magnetoplasmons ( mp ) , in a two - dimensional electron gas , are excitations between ll , known to be described in terms of excitonic transitions due to electron - electron interactions ( eei ) : they reveal a specific dispersion as a function of the two dimensional wave vector @xmath7 of the exciton . for a c2deg ,",
    "the theory , derived in the frame of the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , has been first developed @xcite for integer values of the filling factor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the two - dimensional carrier concentration and the flux quantum respectively ) .",
    "these studies have been extended to the case of non - integer values of @xmath11 @xcite and have also included the calculation of matrix elements for the optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "the effects of eei in graphene have recently been reported on a theoretical basis @xcite but with a different model than that of refs . @xcite and restricted to integer values of the filling factor .",
    "we have followed here the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been shown to reproduce * quantitatively * experimental results @xcite when they are interpreted in terms of mp excitations .",
    "because of the kohn s theorem @xcite , the eei effects turn out to be tiny for c2deg",
    ". however this theorem does not apply for a linear dispersion law and therefore eei are expected to induce significant effects in graphene .",
    "indeed recent experimental investigations of the magneto - optical transitions in graphene @xcite have been interpreted with an effective velocity @xmath12 , replacing @xmath3 in eq.1 , ranging between @xmath13 to @xmath14 and showing a re - normalization of @xmath3 which here , we will show , is mainly due to electron - electron interactions .    on general grounds ,",
    "the coulomb energy characteristic of electron - electron interaction in magnetic field is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electronic dielectric constant of the material and @xmath17 the magnetic field length .",
    "the magnetoplasmon approach assumes that @xmath18 is smaller than the one - electron energy transitions . in the present case of graphene @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "( see eq.1 ) leading to the ratio @xmath21 that is a condition better fulfilled for graphene than for gaas based c2deg and furthermore not dependent on the value of the magnetic field .",
    "magneto - excitons should be therefore more stable in graphene than in c2deg and the approach derived for these later compounds should be valid .",
    "the report is organized as follows : we will first describe the general formalism used to derive the mp dispersion curves ( section ii ) . we apply it to the case of filling factors @xmath22 in section iii and to the case of @xmath23 in section iv .",
    "results will be discussed and compared to experimental results in section v. the details of calculations are reported in the appendices .",
    "in contrast to the gaas case , graphene has two valleys which lead to the conclusion that in the absence of spin splitting and valley splitting each landau level ( ll ) is , in general , four times degenerate .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy of the @xmath24 ll is still due to spin and valley symmetries , but two of these levels have an electron - like character and the two other ones a hole - like character .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the zero temperature case . because of the peculiar symmetry of the problem the wave functions have a spinor character which can be expressed in the landau gauge , with the potential vector components of the magnetic field @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the two - dimensional vector of components @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 for @xmath24 and @xmath32 otherwise whereas @xmath33 when @xmath34 respectively .",

    "10 describes the simultaneous annihilation and creation of excitons at different points of the brillouin zone ( rpa contribution ) : it includes all possible transitions without restriction to spin or valley indices .",

    "the summation over @xmath76 , for these terms , has to include all ll from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "the evaluation of the exchange contributions to the different situations is given in appendix a.    solving eq.10 results in diagonalizing an hamiltonian , the size of which depends on the number of transitions which are assumed to be coupled by electron - electron interactions . in reality",
    "this number is very large for graphene due to the existence of interband transitions but since @xmath18 is smaller than the energy of transitions , we can reasonably assume , in the spirit of the hf approximation , that eei will not couple , at first order , transitions with different one - electron energies . in that case , the problem reduces to solve the hamiltonian for each type of optical transitions which depend on the value of the filling factor .",
    "however , even if one solves the whole problem in successive steps , one has to keep in mind that a * common * energy scale should be adopted for all transitions in order to compare such results with experimental ones .    when writing the hamiltonian , using eq .",

    "we will neglect the spin splitting @xmath84 which is small in the case of graphene @xcite but will not change anyway the conclusions since the optical transitions conserve the spin .",
    "we will furthermore assume in the following that there exists some valley splitting @xmath85 first suggested by gusynin _",
    "the existence of such a valley splitting , has been recently supported by different models .",
    "some of these models include different types of electron - phonon interactions @xcite : they all predict a linear dependence of @xmath85 with the magnetic field .",

    "this is not necessary true since experimental results @xcite tend to favor a situation , where for @xmath88 , the system becomes spin polarized .",

    "therefore this problem is not specific to graphene but , in that case , one can solve it , at least , in a semi - empirical way .",
    "the divergence of @xmath118 is due to the infinite summation over ll ( see eq .",
    "a2 ) which is physically artificial . we could then define , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , a cut - off value on energy or number of ll , but this limit is quite arbitrary .",
    "we propose to treat the problem in a semi - empirical way , using @xmath118 as a parameter fitted , for one type of transitions , to experimental data and then to deduce all the re - normalized velocities attached to the other transitions .",
    "doing so , we _ implicitly assume _ that all the re - normalization of the velocity , for the fitted transition , is only due to electron - electron interactions neglecting any possible contribution from electron - phonon interaction which may be important in carbon based compounds .",
    "among experimental data which could be used for this fitting , those related to magneto - transmission measurements @xcite are those which are expected to reflect the magneto - plasmon picture developed is this study .",
    "another set of data , based on photoconductivity measurements on ex - foliated graphene @xcite can also be considered to compare results .",
    "we will use the data of ref.@xcite , obtained on ex - foliated graphene , to fit @xmath118 to the @xmath203 transition at @xmath120 . in this reference , the re - normalized fermi velocity @xmath215 which , from eq.30 , leads to a value @xmath216 .",
    "when injecting this value in eq .",
    "31 , we predict a re - normalized fermi velocity @xmath217 to be compared with the corresponding experimental value @xcite @xmath218 .",
    "the agreement is reasonable .",
    "as seen on both experimental and theoretical grounds , the re - normalized velocity differs for different transitions .",
    "one can then try to evaluate these velocities for other transitions .",
    "the results are given in table 1 for integer values of @xmath11 .",
    "the value quoted in the table , from ref.@xcite , corresponds to the transition @xmath24 to @xmath153 whereas the corresponding value for the transition @xmath219 to @xmath24 is found to be @xmath220 .",
    "this corresponds to an asymmetry of the conduction and valence levels not taken into account in our model but also not reported in ref.@xcite for this transition .    in table 1",
    ", we have included the results of the re - normalized fermi velocity for transitions between ll @xmath221 to @xmath222 , @xmath154 to @xmath221 , @xmath223 to @xmath222 for which we have calculated the diagonal elements of the corresponding hamiltonians .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as clearly apparent , from table 1 , @xmath12 varies strongly with the transition though it seems to be relatively constant for all interband transitions .",
    "this qualitative feature is also observed in experiments performed on epitaxial multi - layer graphene @xcite . however in these experiments the reported values of @xmath224 for all transitions is the same and equal to @xmath225 which is , at present , not understood .",
    "one could , a priori , think that the results obtained are dependent on the value of @xmath3 adopted in the calculations .",
    "in fact one can vary this value over a large range , for instance , from @xmath226 to @xmath227 getting values for @xmath228 to @xmath229 respectively but the quantity which enters the hamiltonians is in fact @xmath230 which * remains constant * , independent on @xmath3 and equal to @xmath231 .",
    "this value has been adopted to calculate the dispersion curves of figs . 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 .",
    "it is therefore not possible from experimental data on energies to determine @xmath118 but all transitions are now given with a * common * energy scale .",
    "on the other hand the oscillator strengths of the transitions are proportional to @xmath124 and then absolute transmission measurements could in principle give information on @xmath3 and therefore on @xmath118 .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed , within the hartree - fock approximation , a full treatment of the magnetoplasmon picture in graphene valid for a very large range of magnetic fields .",
    "this model , applied for filling factors up to 6 , shows that the electron - electron interactions induce different effects : ( i ) for some of the transitions these interactions lead to a splitting of the optical transitions and ( ii ) they are responsible for a strong re - normalization of the fermi velocity as observed in magneto - optical experiments .",
    "this re - normalization is found to be dependent on the type of investigated transitions .",
    "the optical conductivity components have been evaluated showing that the oscillator strength of the optical transitions is proportional to @xmath124 and not to the square of the re - normalized velocity.the theory has been derived for all transitions with a common energy scale which should allow a direct comparison of its predictions with future experimental works .",
