    "heavy ion programs at large hadron collider ( lhc ) in european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) and at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) have focused on the physics of strongly interacting matter of quarks and gluons under extreme conditions , namely , on the physics of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite . by colliding two heavy nuclei at relativistic energies ,",
    "the matter formed in the collision is expected to be in the state of qgp in temperatures up to 400 mev @xmath0 k. such a high temperature was reached in the early universe about ten micro seconds after the big bang .",
    "one of the main goals of the heavy ion programs is to extract bulk and transport properties of the qgp from analyses of experimental data .",
    "so far , a vast body of experimental data have been obtained at rhic and lhc . among them , the azimuthal anisotropy of the emitted particles , so - called elliptic flow  @xcite is one of the main observables to provide information of the bulk properties of the qgp . in particular , the large observed value of elliptic flow at rhic was one of the main reasons to conclude that the matter produced in the collisions at rhic does indeed thermalise and form qgp  @xcite .    in a non - central collision of two spherical nuclei",
    ", the reaction zone has an an almond - like shape in the plane perpendicular to the collision axis , so called transverse plane .",
    "because of this geometry , pressure gradient within the reaction zone is not azimuthally isotropic , but it is larger along the impact parameter than to the direction orthogonal to it .",
    "this leads to anisotropic expansion of the system with more particles being emitted along the impact parameter than orthogonal to it .",
    "it is customary to call the plane spanned by the beam and the impact parameter a reaction plane , and thus we say that larger emission along the impact parameter means larger emission `` in - plane '' than `` out - of - plane '' .",
    "this anisotropic particle emission can be quantified by fourier expanding the azimuthal distribution of observed particles .",
    "in particular , this kind of anisotropy is quantified by the second fourier coefficient of the expansion , @xmath1 . since a finite @xmath1 in a fourier expansion corresponds to an elliptic shape , this anisotropy is commonly called _ elliptic flow",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly ideal hydrodynamics , which neglects all the dissipative effects , gave a good description of the elliptic flow observed at rhic  @xcite .",
    "given a fact that the expansion rate of the system formed in a heavy ion collision is tremendously large ( @xmath210@xmath3/sec ) , it is far from obvious that dissipative effects can be neglected .",
    "since in ideal hydrodynamics perfect local equilibrium is assumed to hold at any instant , couplings among constituents of the fluid must be so strong that relaxation of the system against any thermodynamic forces happens extremely quickly .",
    "thus , from the agreement of hydrodynamic prediction with the elliptic flow data , an announcement of the  discovery of perfect fluidity \" was made @xcite , and a new paradigm of the strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) was established @xcite .",
    "however , the described shape of the reaction zone is realistic only as an average over many collisions .",
    "since the nuclei are not uniform but consist of separate nucleons , we may expect the reaction zone in a single event to depict similar granular structure to the nuclei .",
    "for example , according to the monte - carlo glauber model  @xcite the reaction zone consists of several peaks ( _ a.k.a .",
    "_ hot spots ) and valleys originating from the configuration of nucleons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "this irregular structure means that even if the underlying shape of the reaction zone in a non - central collision is almond - like , it has been distorted and tilted .",
    "thus , if one fits an ellipse to the reaction zone , its minor axis no longer aligns with the impact parameter .",
    "as described , elliptic flow is generated by the anisotropy of pressure gradient .",
    "now , if the thermodynamic language of pressure gradients is applicable in an individual event , the largest gradient and thus the largest emission of particles is not along the reaction plane .",
    "it is along the participant plane , which is spanned by the beam and the minor axis of the reaction zone .",
    "thus , the particle distribution should not be fourier expanded with respect to the reaction plane , but to the participant plane .",
    "the importance of these event - by - event fluctuations of the shape and orientation of reaction zone was discovered when trying to understand the behaviour of @xmath1 in cu+cu collisions .",
    "it had been found that when experimentally measured @xmath1 was divided by the modelled eccentricity of the reaction zone . for definitions ,",
    "see section  [ sec : ic ] .",
    "] , @xmath4 , the ratio @xmath5 scales with transverse density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the modelled transverse area of the overlap region and @xmath8 is the measured final particle multiplicity at midrapidity  @xcite .",
    "however , the measured @xmath1 in cu+cu collisions did not obey such a scaling , but when the eccentricity @xmath4 was replaced by the participant eccentricity @xmath9 , the scaling was restored  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that @xmath4 is always evaluated with respect to the reaction plane , whereas the participant eccentricity @xmath9 is evaluated with respect to the participant plane in each individual event , and thus takes into account the fluctuations in the orientation of the reaction zone @xcite .    since the reaction zone has a complicated azimuthal structure , and the elliptic flow",
    "was explained as a result of the azimuthal variation of the pressure gradient , it is natural to expect that the fourier coefficients beyond @xmath1 would be nonzero as well . the third coefficient in the fourier expansion , @xmath10 ,",
    "is called triangular flow  @xcite .",
    "it is generated by the triangular component of the shape of the fluctuating reaction zone , and some puzzling phenomena in intermediate transverse momentum regions can be interpreted as manifestation of triangular flow .",
    "for example , mach - cone like structure was discovered in the away - side region in di - hadron correlation functions at rhic  @xcite when one subtracts background elliptic flow component from it .",
    "recently , it was found that these di - hadron correlation functions can be reproduced by a sum of independently analysed higher harmonic components  @xcite , which indicates that mach - cone like structure would be caused simply by collective triangular flow .",
    "if one fourier - decomposes the azimuthal particle distribution , one can obtain information how the system responds to the initial fluctuating profile and from this response one may deduce what the properties of the system itself are @xcite .",
    "this reminds an analysis in observational cosmology : through decomposition of power spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation into spherical harmonics , one can constrain important cosmological constants and even mass / energy budget of the universe @xcite .    in the observational cosmology ,",
    "analysis tools  @xcite played important roles in extracting cosmological parameters .",
    "the situation in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions is quite similar to this @xcite : one has to develop analysis tools to extract the properties of the qgp from experimental data . from this point of view",
    ", let us overview the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "high energy heavy ion collisions contain rich physics and exhibit many aspects of dynamics according to relevant energy and time scales .",
    "two energetic , lorentz - contracted , heavy nuclei collide with each other .",
    "these nuclei can be described by the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) , a universal form of hadrons and nuclei at extremely high energies @xcite .",
    "these collisions can be viewed as collisions of two bunches of highly coherent and dense gluons . just after the collisions , longitudinal colour electric and magnetic fields , which are also known as the colour flux tubes  @xcite",
    "are formed between two passing nuclei .",
    "subsequent non - equilibrium evolution of these colour fields towards locally thermalised qgp is called  glasma \"  @xcite .",
    "once local thermalisation is achieved , a qgp fluid expands hydrodynamically , cools down and turns into a hadronic gas .",
    "hadrons continue to rescatter until the system is so dilute that interactions become very rare , and hadrons stream freely towards the detectors .    since the final observables are the result of all these various stages of the collision , it is important to describe the heavy ion collision as a whole .",
    "so far , we have developed the following integrated dynamical model  @xcite to describe the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "for the initial stage , initial conditions are calculated using the cgc picture @xcite .",
    "using these initial conditions , we describe fully three dimensional ideal hydrodynamic expansion of the qgp fluid @xcite using a realistic equation of state from lattice qcd simulations @xcite . the late stage evolution of the hadron gas is described using microscopic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "technical details about numerical simulations of ideal hydrodynamics and hadronic cascades can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss experimental observables , in particular anisotropic flow , at rhic and lhc energies using an integrated dynamical model .",
    "a special emphasis will be put on discussion about initial conditions and final flow analysis methods from an event - by - event analysis point of view . in theoretical calculations",
    "both the reaction plane and the participant plane are trivially known , but in experiments it is impossible to measure the reaction plane , and it is quite hard to precisely determine the participant plane from the finite number of observed particles .",
    "thus , several flow analysis methods have been proposed @xcite to experimentally measure anisotropic flow .",
    "hence , a _ consistent _ comparison of hydrodynamic results with experimental observables is non - trivial . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the differences of several experimental methods of flow analysis by using them to analyse the output of the integrated dynamical model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe and review the hybrid models , in which hydrodynamics is combined with hadronic cascade , and hydrodynamic simulations on an event - by - event basis .",
    "in particular we describe each module and the interfaces between them of our integrated dynamical model in sec .",
    "[ sec : result1 ] , we first summarise the results obtained using smooth initial profiles , which are the conventional initial conditions employed in hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we next show results from event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : result2 ] emphasising the importance of employing the same flow analysis method as in experiment .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion and outlook .",
    "integrated dynamical models , in general , consist of three separate stages : initial conditions , hydrodynamics and hadronic cascade . in our version ,",
    "the initial particle production in the collision of the nuclei is either described by the mc - kln version of the colour glass condensate , or parametrised using the mc - glauber model .",
    "these models provide the initial state for the subsequent expansion of the matter , which we describe by relativistic ideal hydrodynamics . as for the equation of state ,",
    "we employ results from the state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "once the matter is dilute enough to form hadrons , we switch the description of the system from fluid dynamics to microscopic hadron cascade . in this section",
    "we describe all these stages of the integrated model , and how we connect hydrodynamics to cascade .",
    "we also review current status of the equation of state and its application , hybrid models , and event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations .      to describe a system in length scales much larger than a typical microscopic length scale , like the mean free path , it is sufficient to characterise it in terms of a few macroscopic fields : the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 , and conserved charge currents @xmath12 ( if any ) . in relativistic fluid dynamics ,",
    "the equations of motion are given by the conservation laws for these fields @xmath13 without any additional constraints these @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the number of conserved currents ) equations contain @xmath16 unknown variables .",
    "to close the system of equations , one either has to provide further equations in the form of constituent equations for dissipative currents ( shear stress tensor @xmath17 , bulk pressure @xmath18 and energy flow / particle number diffusion @xmath19 ) , or to eliminate some of the variables by further approximations . in the following we apply the latter approach and reduce the number of unknowns by assuming that the fluid is in exact local thermodynamical equilibrium .    in a local thermodynamical equilibrium ,",
    "the single particle phase - space distribution for noninteracting fermions or bosons is @xmath20 when one applies this to the kinetic theory definitions of the energy - momentum tensor and charged currents , one obtains @xmath21\\ , u^\\mu(x ) u^\\nu(x ) - p(x)g^{\\mu\\nu } ,      { \\hspace{1 cm } } { \\rm and } { \\hspace{1 cm } }      j^{\\mu}_i(x ) = n_i(x ) u^\\mu(x),\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath22 is the energy , and @xmath23 are the charge densities in the local rest frame of the fluid , @xmath24 is the thermodynamic pressure and @xmath25 is the fluid flow four - velocity .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : idealtmunu ] ) imply that for a fluid in local thermodynamical equilibrium the dissipative currents are zero .",
    "this consideration of a non - interacting gas in local equilibrium is the starting point of the ideal fluid approximation : one postulates that the energy - momentum tensor and charge currents are of the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : idealtmunu ] ) , and thus the dissipative currents are zero by definition .",
    "such an approximation reduces the number of unknown variables in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) to @xmath26 : the above mentioned densities , pressure and three components of the flow four - velocity ( note that the usual normalisation @xmath27 reduces the number of unknowns by one ) . to finally close the system of equations",
    ", an additional equation is usually provided in the form of the equilibrium equation of state ( eos ) of the matter , which expresses the pressure and densities in terms of thermodynamical parameters temperature @xmath28 and chemical potentials @xmath29 , @xmath30 . however , to solve the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) , it is often practical to provide the eos in the form @xmath31 connecting the pressure directly to the densities .",
    "the knowledge of temperature and chemical potentials is not necessarily required to calculate the evolution of the fluid itself",
    ".    note that once the eos , and boundary conditions ( usually referred to as initial conditions ) for the set of differential equations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) are fixed , the evolution is determined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) . in the ideal fluid approximation ,",
    "the only place where information about the nature of the constituents of the fluid and their microscopic interactions enters , is the eos .    in the implementation of our model",
    ", we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) numerically in all three spatial dimensions .",
    "we employ the milne coordinates ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 is proper time and @xmath37 is space - time rapidity .",
    "since we are mostly interested in the observables at midrapidity in the collider energies gev at rhic and @xmath38 tev at lhc . ]",
    ", we can ignore the baryon current @xcite  .",
    "as usual in hydrodynamical models , we take the spatial boundary condition to be vacuum at infinity  @xcite , _ i.e. _  the hydrodynamical evolution proceeds independently without any feedback from the cascade . the temporal boundary , _",
    "i.e. _  the initial value(s ) for the differential equations are described in section  [ sec : ic ] .",
    "we employ the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) @xcite as an algorithm to solve the equations of ideal hydrodynamics ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) ) . ppm is known to be robust against strong shocks , therefore it is suitable to apply for bumpy initial conditions in event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations . for details on ppm , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of strongly interacting matter can be obtained either by using various models or by lattice qcd calculations  @xcite . even if the recent lattice qcd calculations of the eos have provided continuum extrapolated results  @xcite , there is a practical reason to use the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model for the eos at low temperatures .",
    "when converting fluid to particles using the cooper - frye procedure as described in section  [ sec : f2 g ] , the conservation laws are obeyed without any further considerations if the degrees of freedom are the same before and after particlisation . in other words , if the emitted particles are the same particles the fluid consists of . if the fluid is described as hadron resonance gas , the degrees of freedom and their properties are well known , and these degrees of freedom are the experimentally observable hadrons which distributions we eventually want to calculate .",
    "hrg has also been shown to provide a reasonably good approximation of the eos of interacting hadron gas in temperatures slightly below the pion mass  @xcite , and its use is therefore justified .    to show how an eos combining a hadron resonance gas at low temperatures , and lattice qcd results at high temperatures",
    "can be made , we briefly review the construction of the @xmath39-v1.1 parametrization  @xcite .",
    "the high temperature part of this eos is based on the lattice qcd results of the hotqcd collaboration  @xcite , and its low temperature part contains the same hadrons and resonances as the jam hadron cascade  @xcite .",
    "we have also used this eos to calculate the results discussed in sections  [ sec : result1 ] and  [ sec : result2 ] .",
    "the starting point of the construction of the @xmath39 eos is the trace anomaly @xmath40 evaluated on lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trace ] .",
    "the lattice results are parametrised and connected to the trace anomaly of hrg preserving the smooth crossover nature of the transition .",
    "the trace anomaly is then converted to pressure via @xmath41 where pressure at the lower integration limit , @xmath42 , is given by hrg .",
    "energy and entropy densities are subsequently obtained via laws of thermodynamics . by construction",
    "such an eos is limited to zero net baryon density and zero net strangeness , but as mentioned zero charge is a good approximation when describing the system at midrapidity in collisions at rhic and lhc .    the trace anomaly of the @xmath39-v1.1 eos is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace ] , and compared to recent lattice qcd results .",
    "it differs considerably from the continuum extrapolated result by the budapest - wuppertal collaboration  @xcite .",
    "however , the budapest - wuppertal eos deviates from hrg already at @xmath43140 mev , which necessitates switching from fluid to cascade below this temperature leading to much worse reproduction of data in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath39 parametrisation follows hrg up to @xmath44 mev temperature providing much more freedom in choosing the switching temperature , and therefore we prefer to use it . to estimate",
    "the uncertainty our choice of eos produces in the particle anisotropies , we have calculated the elliptic flow anisotropy @xmath1 in impact parameter @xmath45 fm au+au collisions at the full rhic energy ( @xmath46 gev ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : v2eos ] . in this calculation",
    "we follow the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite to test various parametrizations of the eos .",
    "we use ideal fluid hydrodynamical model and assume chemical equilibrium until kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the model is initialized using an optical glauber model with components proportional to the number of participants and binary collisions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ic ] and refs .",
    "@xcite ) the parameters are chosen to reproduce the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity .",
    "the usual procedure requires choosing the freeze - out temperature to reproduce the particle spectra in most central collisions , but that would require the use of temperature @xmath47 mev . as mentioned , the budapest - wuppertal eos deviates from hrg below that temperature , and thus converting fluid to free particles in such a temperature violates conservation of energy .",
    "therefore we used freeze - out temperature @xmath48 mev for both eoss even if it leads to slightly flatter @xmath49 distributions of pions and protons than experimentally observed . both eoss , budapest - wuppertal and @xmath39 lead to very similar @xmath49 distributions at that temperature . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2eos ] , the difference in @xmath49-differential elliptic flow is tiny as well , and smaller than the experimental errors .",
    "thus we consider the use of @xmath39-v1.1 eos a reasonable approximation .",
    "similar insensitivity to the details of the eos was seen in ref .",
    "@xcite where different parametrizations of lattice eos were tested . even if the eos governs the expansion of the fluid and buildup of collective motion , the details of the eos have tiny observable consequences .",
    "the rule of thumb is that the stiffer the eos , _",
    "i.e. _ , the larger the speed of sound in the fluid , the larger the flow velocity generated during the expansion .",
    "but , even if larger flow velocity mean flatter @xmath49 spectrum ( see f.ex .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this effect can be negated by choosing the fluid to freeze - out earlier at larger temperature , by assuming later thermalisation time and thus later start of the hydrodynamical evolution , by changing the initial shape of the density distribution ( if the model allows ) or by any combination of these three .",
    "the integrated dynamical models discussed in this paper have no freeze - out temperature , but the final particle distributions are sensitive to the switching temperature from hydro to cascade , and all these problems hamper these models as well .    based on the @xmath49 distributions on particles alone , we can basically only say that the eos must contain a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "otherwise the @xmath49 distributions come too flat , see discussion and fig .  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite , nor does the eos contain all the observed particles and resonances .",
    "to say anything beyond the large number of degrees of freedom requires the use of more sophisticated observables like the azimuthal anisotropy @xmath1 or the hbt - radii , a.k.a .",
    "femtoscopy . in general the changes in @xmath1 due to different eoss can be compensated by changing the freeze - out temperature",
    ". there is , however , an exception .",
    "the @xmath49 differential anisotropy of protons , @xmath50 , is to some extent sensitive to the order of phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eoscomparisoni ] where pion and proton @xmath50 in minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath51 gev are calculated using ideal fluid hydrodynamical model , and four different eoss .",
    "the eoss are the bag model based eos with a first order phase transition between hrg and ideal parton gas ( eos  q ) , pure hadron resonance gas with no phase transition ( eos  h ) , a lattice inspired quasiparticle model eos ( eos qp , which is quite close to the present lattice qcd eoss ) by schneider and weise  @xcite , and an eos with a parametrised smooth crossover from hrg to ideal parton gas ( eos  t ) . as seen in the figure , the sensitivity of pion @xmath50 on the eos is tiny , but proton @xmath50 shows clear sensitivity on eos .",
    "surprisingly it is the eos q with the first order phase transition which provides the best fit to the data  a construction ruled out by the lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the lattice inspired eos qp leads to proton @xmath50 which is clearly above the data , and almost as large as the @xmath50 obtained using the purely hadronic eos  h. the eos  t , which has a very rapid crossover leads to proton @xmath50 which is almost as close to the data than the one obtained using eos  q. this means that the order of the phase transition does not affect the build up of anisotropy , but how rapid the transition is does have an effect .",
    "nevertheless , eos  t is ruled out by the present lattice data .    on the other hand",
    ", it can be argued that a soft eos leads to a long lifetime of the system , which is excluded by the hbt measurements  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that if one assumes a relatively hard , lattice inspired eos , it is possible to reproduce the measured hbt radii  @xcite , although in that case the proton @xmath50 is not reproduced .",
    "this apparent contradiction appears when using ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "when dissipative corrections are applied , the proton @xmath50 can be reproduced also when a lattice based hard eos is used , see fig .",
    "[ fig : v2ptpidphenix ] in sect .",
    "[ sec : rhicresult ] , or ref .",
    "thus there is no contradiction between lattice qcd eos and the observed particle anisotropies .",
    "the previous discussion about the sensitivity of the particle distributions to eos is based on ideal fluid dynamics , since so far there has been no systematic study addressing what we can learn about the eos of strongly interacting matter using either dissipative hydrodynamics or integrated models .",
    "but since dissipative corrections are supposed to be small in the fluid dynamical stage , it is highly unlikely that adding dissipation would make the fluid evolution more sensitive to the details of the eos .",
    "thus we may expect that what we have learned about the effects of eos on flow using ideal fluid dynamics , holds for dissipative fluids as well .",
    "the qgp produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions expands , cools down and goes through a transition to a hadronic gas . at this late stage ,",
    "the hadronic system is so diluted that it would be hard to maintain equilibrium during the evolution .",
    "thus , we switch from a macroscopic fluid dynamical picture to a microscopic kinetic picture at a switching temperature @xmath52 . in this subsection , we discuss how to change from hydrodynamic description to kinetic description .",
    "we will discuss dynamics of hadron cascade in the next subsection .",
    "we employ the cooper - frye formula @xcite to calculate the single particle phase - space distribution for all hadrons in the hadronic equation of state . for a hadron of species @xmath53 ,",
    "the contribution to the distribution from a single fluid element located at @xmath33 is @xmath54\\pm 1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is a normal vector of a surface element of a constant temperature hypersurface @xmath56 .    in the actual calculations , we monte - carlo sample the distributions of hadrons emitted from individual surface elements @xcite . regarding this ,",
    "some comments on the conservation laws are in order here :    1 .",
    "the cooper - frye formula counts the _ net _ number of emitted particles @xcite . here",
    "the net number means the number of particles moving outwards through the surface minus the number of particles moving inwards .",
    "thus the number obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cflocal ] ) could be negative in a case of a fluid element with either a space - like normal vector @xmath57 or a time - like normal vector having a negative time component .",
    "this so - called negative contribution problem of cooper - frye , is a long - standing problem in hydrodynamical modelling of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "note that the _ total _ number of particles obtained by summing the contribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cflocal ] ) over _ all _ surface elements is positive for all initial states relevant for heavy ion collisions .",
    "although the in - coming particles are necessary to ensure the energy momentum conservation , it is conceptually difficult to treat the negative number in the subsequent kinetic approach .",
    "however , at the time of particlisation at @xmath58 the collective flow is large , and thus the particle distributions are boosted to the direction of the flow , i.e. outwards . therefore the yield of the in - coming particles is much smaller than the yield of out - going particles , and they form only a small correction of the order of 5% to the total multiplicity and the energy of the system . as a first order approximation , we may thus ignore these in - coming particles without violating the conservation laws significantly .",
    "by sampling we create an integer number of particles from a tiny fluid element whose three dimensional volume is typically @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "an expectation value of the number of particles from this fluid element in the grand canonical ensemble is , of course , not an integer and in our calculations less than unity . therefore energy , momentum and charges",
    "are not conserved in each individual sampling , but only in average  as is customary for a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this issue could be resolved by an oversampling method : at each fluid element , @xmath61 times larger number of particles is sampled with @xmath61 being large and , the subsequent dynamics of hadrons is simulated with the cross section divided by @xmath61 to ensure the original boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "this procedure can maintain energy momentum conservation of the order of @xmath62 at the particlisation . however , this would be numerically expensive and neglect the effect of fluctuations because different events are averaged over in the oversampling method .",
    "a faster method which is called  local - ensemble \" method has been proposed in refs .",
    "an alternative approach is to impose the requirement of the conservation of energy and charges on the sampling procedure as done in refs .",
    "this approach maintains the effect of fluctuations , but requires generating several ensembles of particles , where only parts are kept to avoid bias .",
    "3 .   in principle",
    "one should switch from a macroscopic fluid picture to a microscopic particle picture in a temperature region where both descriptions give similar results .",
    "however , the single particle distribution under _ local _ equilibrium never becomes a solution of the boltzmann equation : one needs viscous corrections to the local equilibrium distribution to match the two solutions .",
    "since we use ideal fluid hydrodynamics without any dissipative corrections , the hydrodynamical evolution always differs from the cascade .",
    "thus we can not expect to find a region where the solutions of both models would agree , and simply regard the single particle phase - space distribution obtained using hydrodynamics as an initial condition for the hadron cascade .    keeping these issues and assumptions in mind",
    ", we calculate a discrete single particle phase - space distribution on an event - by - event basis .",
    "first , we need the information of the particlisation hypersurface to apply the cooper - frye formula ( eq .  ( [ eq : cflocal ] ) ) .",
    "we approximate the surface normal @xmath63 in the following way :    _ bulk emission _ : at each time step @xmath64 in a hydrodynamic simulation , we scan all the fluid elements to check whether particlisation condition for bulk emission ( a ) @xmath65 or ( b ) @xmath66 is satisfied . when this condition is satisfied , information about a surface element vector ( a ) @xmath67 or ( b ) @xmath68 together with flow velocity @xmath69 at this point are stored . here",

    "the sum is taken over an ensemble of particles which do not coincide with particles which @xmath245 one wants to obtain .",
    "in fact , there have been various event plane methods for the different detector setups .",

    "centrality is defined using the total transverse energy of charged particles deposited in these rapidity regions , as prescribed by the atlas collaboration @xcite .    in the  @xmath187-subevent \" method ,",
    "non - flow effects can be eliminated at midrapidity when event plane angle is determined away from midrapidity . on the other hand",

    "@xmath255 ( @xmath256 ) is the number of particles in the positive ( negative ) rapidity region .",

    "contrary to the cases for @xmath264 and 3 , the distributions for @xmath291 and 5 have a peak at @xmath292 only in central collisions .",
    "peak structure gradually disappears as moving to peripheral collisions and eventually another peak appears at @xmath293 in the peripheral collisions ( 50 - 60% centrality ) .",
    "these results also suggest that @xmath249s at least @xmath291 and 5 are generated by other order of initial geometry @xmath277 ( @xmath294 ) .    before showing detailed results from event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "we make two remarks here : since the event plane is often determined using particles in forward and backward rapidity regions ( also known as `` @xmath187-subevent method '' ) , full three dimensional dynamical simulations are essential if one wants to do the flow analysis in the same way than in experiments .",
    "for example , the phenix collaboration at rhic utilises the beam beam counter ( bbc ) or the reaction plane detector ( rxnp ) in forward and backward rapidity regions to determine event planes .",
    "if one assumes boost invariance in dynamical calculations , one can not perform this kind of flow analysis exactly .",
    "second , the effect of experimental event plane resolution can not be properly evaluated unless one samples a finite number of particles at particlisation .",
    "the cooper - frye formula @xcite has been conventionally used to calculate particle spectra in hydrodynamic calculations , but it gives smooth and continuous function of momentum distributions .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath61 times over - sampling of particles from a fluid element with @xmath295 limit , which is , however , not adequate if event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations are supposed to describe actual events .",

    "<S> we review integrated dynamical approaches to describe heavy ion reaction as a whole at ultrarelativistic energies . </S>",
    "<S> since final observables result from all the history of the reaction , it is important to describe all the stages of the reaction to obtain the properties of the quark gluon plasma from experimental data . as an example of these approaches , we develop an integrated dynamical model , which is composed of a fully ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model with the state - of - the - art equation of state based on lattice qcd , and subsequent hadronic cascade in the late stage . </S>",
    "<S> initial conditions are obtained employing monte carlo versions of the kharzeev - levin - nardi model ( mc - kln ) or the glauber model ( mc - glauber ) . using this integrated model </S>",
    "<S> , we first simulate relativistic heavy ion collisions at the rhic and lhc energies starting from conventional smooth initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we next utilise each monte carlo samples of initial conditions on an event - by - event basis and perform event - by - event dynamical simulations to accumulate a large number of minimum bias events . </S>",
    "<S> a special attention is paid to performing the flow analysis as in experiments toward consistent comparison of theoretical results with experimental data . </S>"
