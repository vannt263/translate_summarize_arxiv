    "neutrino masses are an indication for the presence of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the simplest extension consisting in adding to the sm fields three right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos and giving them a dirac mass is not very satisfactory since it would require extremely small yukawa couplings , much smaller then the ones for charged particles . a nice way of explaining neutrino masses as well as their smallness is through the so - called seesaw mechanism : new fields with masses much heavier than the electroweak ( ew ) scale , once integrated out ,",
    "generate a dimension - five operator which , after ew symmetry breaking , gives a majorana mass to neutrinos .",
    "when neutrino masses are generated at tree - level , three heavy mediators are possible , namely singlet fermions ( corresponding to the so - called type - i seesaw  @xcite ) , triplet scalar ( type ii  @xcite ) and triplet fermions ( type iii  @xcite ) . independently of the nature of the mediators , the neutrino mass results to be suppressed by their heavy mass .",
    "interestingly , @xmath5 yukawa couplings require the scale of new physics to be around the grand unification scale .",
    "it is then natural to study the seesaw mechanisms in the context of grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "moreover , as it is well known , the presence of low scale supersymmetry ( susy ) triggers the unification of gauge couplings , so that usually susy guts are considered .    in the literature plenty of models of susy guts including a seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation has been proposed .",
    "actually , many different guts have been studied , involving the different seesaws , especially the types i and ii . as for the type iii ( and type i+iii )",
    ", its embedding in a susy gut was firstly proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and then discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in the context of a renormalizable model ) and in ref .",
    "@xcite , and embedded in a flavour model in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all these cases",
    "the grand unified group considered is su(5 ) , which is the simplest group in which the sm gauge group can be embedded ( for a wide discussion about susy su(5 ) with the three different seesaw mechanisms , see @xcite ) . in a minimal version of su(5 )  @xcite neutrinos are massless , so that this gut model has to be extended in order to account for neutrino masses .",
    "the model we consider here is somehow the simplest extension of a susy su(5 ) accounting for neutrino masses , since with the simple addition of only one su(5 ) representation two neutrino masses are generated via a mixed type i+iii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this is different from other models , where at least two representations were needed to account for two or three neutrino masses .",
    "indeed , in the case of type i seesaw , the addition of at least two singlets is mandatory , while for the type ii one must include both a triplet and its conjugate ( or , in terms of su(5 ) multiplets , a * 15 * and a @xmath6  @xcite ) .",
    "this model is the susy version of the model firstly proposed in ref .",
    "also there two neutrino masses are obtained via a mixed type i+iii seesaw , but being the model non - susy , the spectrum is completely different .",
    "indeed , to guarantee unification , the triplet must be at the tev scale , while the singlet mass is not specified . in this model lepton flavour violation ( lfv )",
    "is usually suppressed either by the small yukawas or by a large mass .",
    "this is the standard situation in non - susy seesaw models , unless a low - scale inverse seesaw is realized @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in presence of cancellations in the neutrino mass matrix , sizable rates of lfv processes are still possible ( see for example , in the context of type i+iii seesaw , @xcite ) .    here",
    "we study in detail the phenomenology of this `` minimal '' susy",
    "su(5 ) with massive neutrinos , paying particular attention to the effects on lfv processes . in order to isolate the effects purely induced by the rg running of the susy parameters we assume universal soft masses at the gut scale .",
    "we also discuss possible related effects in the quark sector and how the region of the parameter space where the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is a viable dark matter ( dm ) candidate are modified .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we introduce the model , in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss the flavour violation , in sect .  [ sec:4 ] we present numerical results and in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we conclude .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) of this model are gathered in the appendix .",
    "we consider a susy su(5 ) model where the matter content is enlarged with a * 24 * representation of su(5 ) , in order to get neutrino masses .",
    "indeed the * 24 * can be decomposed under @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 give mass to two neutrinos via a mixed type i+iii seesaw mechanism .",
    "the relevant superpotential terms are then @xmath12 here @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as usual . below the su(5 ) breaking scale , the superpotential reads : @xmath16 notice that , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsu(5 ) ] ) , it follows that the @xmath17 octet @xmath18 and the field @xmath19 do not have yukawa interactions with fields which remain lighter than the gut scale .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wsu(5)broken ] ) , it is easy to see that the singlet @xmath10 and the neutral component of the triplet @xmath11 generate neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism : @xmath20 notice that , since @xmath10 and @xmath11 belong to the same su(5 ) multiplet , at the gut scale @xmath21 .",
    "the previous @xmath22 is then a rank-1 matrix and only one neutrino mass is generated . in principle",
    "the yukawas could be misaligned in the running from the gut scale to the seesaw scale simply via rge effects , but in practice the resulting misalignment is too small , giving rise to a second neutrino mass much smaller that the solar mass .",
    "it is then clear that the gut relation on the yukawa couplings must be somehow altered , in order to get two massive neutrinos . since non - renormalizable operators should anyway be added to the susy su(5 )",
    "lagrangian in order to break the unwanted relation @xmath23 which is in disagreement with the experimental value of fermion masses  @xcite , we can also add non - renormalizable operators involving the * 24 * @xcite : @xmath24 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 represents the cut - off of the theory ( e.g. the planck scale @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 is the higgs in the adjoint representation which breaks su(5 ) , with @xmath28 .",
    "the three above operators could be for instance generated by integrating - out , respectively : a higgs superfield in the @xmath29+@xmath30 representation , a matter @xmath29+@xmath31 , a su(5 ) singlet , all having a mass of the order of the scale @xmath25 .",
    "after su(5 ) breaking , the yukawa couplings of the different components of the * 24 * split and the matching at the gut scale reads : @xmath32 in practice the coupling @xmath33 determines the misalignment between @xmath34 and @xmath35 that permits to generate two non - zero neutrino masses .",
    "as we will see later , lfv processes suggest for the seesaw scale an upper bound around @xmath36  gev , corresponding to neutrino yukawa couplings smaller than @xmath37 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ys ] ) we then deduce that @xmath33 should be @xmath38(1 ) and the cutoff scale @xmath25 can not be too large , if we want to saturate these bounds . from now on we will consider @xmath34 and @xmath35 as independent parameters .    in the same way as the splitting among the yuwakas is generated via su(5 ) breaking effect , also a splitting in the masses arise .",
    "the terms contributing to the masses of the * 24 * fields are @xmath39 giving rise to the following masses : @xmath40 where the actual expressions of the @xmath41 in terms of the possible nr operators couplings can be found in @xcite .",
    "if we do not allow fine cancellations , we can conclude that the components of the * 24 * have masses of the same order of magnitude , so that only small threshold effects are introduced and the successful gauge coupling unification of the mssm is maintained .",
    "notice that , since lfv processes disfavor a seesaw scale larger than @xmath42  gev , the coupling @xmath43 should be @xmath37 or smaller while the non - renormalizable couplings @xmath44 can be larger , depending on the cutoff scale @xmath25 .",
    "we now focus on neutrino masses .",
    "( [ eq : numass ] ) can be inverted and the yukawa couplings can be expressed in terms of low energy parameters . since in this case we have only two massive neutrinos , casas - ibarra parameterization is simplified , since the r matrix depends now only on one complex parameter @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa couplings can then be expressed as @xcite : @xmath46 and @xmath47 there is another solution with the opposite sign for the second terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn ] ,  [ eq : tns ] ) . in the above equations , @xmath48 are elements of the pmns matrix and a majorana phase @xmath49 . ] . for the neutrino mass eigenvalues we have in the normal hierarchy ( nh )",
    "case : @xmath50 while in the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) case neutrino masses are given by : @xmath51 where we take the neutrino mass parameters @xcite as measured in the solar and atmospheric oscillation experiments @xmath52 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn ] ,  [ eq : tns ] ) we see that the yukawa couplings grow with the square root of the mass of the heavy fermions , as a trivial consequence of the seesaw formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : numass ] ) , and increase exponentially when im(@xmath45 ) grows . if we want to avoid unnatural cancellations in the neutrino sector ( e.g. between the two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : numass ] ) ) , im(@xmath45 ) should be @xmath53 . as we will show later",
    ", the present bound on @xmath54 can actually constrain it to smaller values .",
    "notice that in what respect neutrino masses , this model is not different from a model with two right - handed neutrinos ( 2rhn ) @xcite , where for instance the same parameterization of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn ] ,  [ eq : tns ] ) holds .",
    "however , this model , besides the fact of being better motivated from a gut perspective , has got some features which distinguish it from a generic 2rhn model :    * up to fine - tuning , the parameter space is more restricted , since it is natural to assume @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be of the same order of magnitude ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ms ] ,  [ eq : mt ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , barring cancellations , @xmath57 and @xmath58 will be also of the same order of magnitude ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : yt ] ,  [ eq : ys ] ) ) . * the presence of the su(5 ) partners of @xmath10 and @xmath11 induces flavour violating effects in the hadronic sector as well , similarly to what happens in the leptonic sector .",
    "again , the relevant couplings @xmath59 , even if in general independent , are expected to be of the same order of @xmath57 and @xmath58 . * the presence of a full * 24 * at an intermediate scale between the gut and the ew scales does not spoil gauge coupling unification if @xmath60 , as in our case , but affects the gauge couplings running above @xmath61 .",
    "this can have an impact on the susy spectrum and , in particular , on the regions of the parameter space which provide a relic density for the lsp within the wmap bounds , as we are going to discuss in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the presence of the fields in the @xmath62 modifies the renormalization group running of the parameters of the model , both the superpotential couplings and the susy breaking terms .",
    "for instance , the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the scalar masses are now given by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the usual mssm 1-loop @xmath65-function and @xmath66 is the new 1-loop contribution given by the new fields in the * 24 * , with clearly @xmath67 only above the * 24 * energy scale .    in particular , the couplings of the seesaw fields , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the lepton doublet will affect the running of the left - handed ( lh ) slepton masses , generating off - diagonal flavour violating entries , in perfect analogy with what happens in the context of supersymmetric seesaw of type i @xcite and type ii @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of the su(5 ) partner , @xmath68 , of the seesaw fields will induce an analogous effect for the rh down squarks .",
    "the complete rges of the model are given in the appendix .",
    "let us display here the @xmath65-functions of , respectively , the lh slepton and rh down - squark soft masses , which are the relevant ones for outlining the effects mentioned above : @xmath69 off - diagonal flavour violating entries in the lh slepton and rh down - squark mass matrices are then generated by rg running from @xmath70 down to the seesaw fields mass scales , even starting with universal boundary conditions at @xmath70 , @xmath71 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : betaml ] ,  [ eq : betamd ] ) , we can estimate the flavour violating mass - insertions , @xmath72 , which parameterize the amount of flavour violation induced by the running . at leading - log",
    ", they read : @xmath73 , \\\\",

    "( [ eq : deltalle ] ,  [ eq : deltarrd ] ) provide a good estimate of the fv mass - insertions , unless @xmath76 is too small .",
    "in the case of @xmath77 , which is indeed possible in the model as we will discuss in the next section , the sfermion masses are generated by the running , but eqs .",
    "( [ eq : deltalle ] ,  [ eq : deltarrd ] ) are clearly not valid anymore , since sfermion masses are vanishing at @xmath70 and possible off - diagonal entries in the mass matrices can be only generated at orders higher than the leading - log .    keeping that in mind , we can still make use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltalle ] ) to get an idea of the expected amount of lfv . for instance , in the case @xmath78 gev , we see from the seesaw formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : numass ] ) , that typically @xmath79 and therefore assuming @xmath80 and @xmath81 , eq .  ( [ eq : deltalle ] ) gives roughly : @xmath82 value which can give sizable effects in the @xmath83-@xmath84 transitions only and can already exclude the susy parameter space in the light sleptons regime .",
    "we can also estimate the typical ratio of the brs of different lfv processes .",
    "given that the main source of lfv is represented by the @xmath85 , we have : @xmath86 hence the ratio of brs in the @xmath87-@xmath83 and @xmath83-@xmath84 channels can be estimated to be : @xmath88 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn ] ,  [ eq : tns ] ) , one can check that @xmath89 in the normal hierarchy case for a real parameter @xmath45 , if @xmath90 and the majorana phase @xmath49 vanishes as well . as the value of @xmath91 increases",
    ", one can verify that @xmath92 diminishes and it becomes @xmath5 for @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly , as soon as im(@xmath45 ) is switched on , @xmath92 rapidly drops to @xmath5 values independently of the value of @xmath91 . as for the role of the phases",
    ", they also generically tend to reduce @xmath92 , even if for small non - zero values of @xmath91 the dirac phase somehow compensates the @xmath91 effect , preventing the reduction of the ratio .",
    "moreover , the presence of the phases increases @xmath94 , from which a bound on im(@xmath45 ) can be derived ( see later ) . in the inverted hierarchy case with a real @xmath45 , @xmath92 can even diverge , since for certain values of @xmath45 @xmath94 can vanish . however , such cases correspond to set - up of the yukawas ( e.g. @xmath95 ) which can not be considered natural in the light of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : yt ] ,  [ eq : ys ] ) . moreover , for @xmath96 , such divergences disappear and @xmath92 tends to @xmath5 values like in the case of normal hierarchy .",
    "let us briefly make here a comparison with other seesaws , still implemented in a su(5 ) context . as already discussed in the previous section , in what respect neutrino masses",
    "our model is not different from a model with a type i seesaw with only two rh neutrinos .",
    "this statement holds also for lfv , with the only difference given by the fact that in the 2rhn model the heavy neutrino masses can be hierarchical , while our model , barring cancellations , predicts @xmath97 . as a consequence higher values for @xmath92 can be obtained  @xcite . in the type",
    "i seesaw with three rh neutrinos , due to the larger number of parameters , even more freedom is allowed . on the contrary in the type ii",
    "seesaw there is a direct relation between high - energy and low - energy neutrino parameters , so that the ratios of the branching ratios of lfv processes can be expressed in terms of neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "when this is embedded into a su(5 ) gut by adding a @xmath98+@xmath99 representation  @xcite , @xmath92 varies between 400 and @xmath5 with increasing @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "notice that in that model the seesaw fields induce flavour violation in the hadronic sector too , as in the model we are studying in this paper .",
    "let us now discuss the induced flavour violation in the hadronic sector . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltarrd ] ) , we see that off - diagonal entries in the @xmath101 mass matrix are induced by the coupling @xmath102 of the down - quark su(2 ) singlets with the * 24 * field @xmath68 .",
    "( [ eq : yt]-[eq : yv ] ) tell us that @xmath102 can not be unequivocally determined in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 and , therefore , in terms of neutrino parameters",
    ". however , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : yt]-[eq : yv ] ) also show that @xmath102 can be naturally expected to be of the same order of magnitude of the seesaw yukawa couplings , as it clearly follows from the su(5 ) embedding of the model . in particular if @xmath103 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : yt]-[eq : yv ] ) , then @xmath104 . in our numerical analysis , we are going to make use of this last assumption can be written as a combination of @xmath35 and @xmath34 . apart from this point , that model gives the same phenomenology discussed here . ] .",
    "anyway , with a free choice of @xmath105 and barring cancellations , we would still get : @xmath106 thus , comparing this expression with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dllestimate ] ) , we find that the typical order of magnitude of the hadronic mass insertion is : @xmath107 with @xmath108 becoming maximal for @xmath109 , when @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , one has to take into account that , like in the mssm , the rge for @xmath111 generates also small @xmath112 proportional to ckm elements , @xmath113 . taking into account this further effect ,",
    "the most stringent bounds , which come from the kaon system , are @xmath114 @xcite . comparing this value with eq .",
    "( [ eq : drrestimate ] ) , we see that the model does not typically predict large deviations from the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) predictions in the hadronic sector and therefore it is safe from hadronic fcnc constraints .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : drrestimate ] ) provides a quite rough estimate and it is worth to study in more detail some hadronic observables , for which experiments have recently showed possible tensions with the sm ( and the cmssm ) predictions . in the next section , in particular , we are going to comment about the impact of the new flavour mixing sources of the model on the kaon cp - violating parameter @xmath3 and on the time - dependent cp asymmetry , @xmath115 , in the decay @xmath116 .",
    "as mentioned above , in order to outline the effects induced by the rg running between the gut scale and the mass scale of the * 24 * fields , we consider universal boundary conditions , namely : a universal scalar mass @xmath76 , a common gaugino mass @xmath117 and trilinear terms @xmath118 .    in order to compute the susy spectrum",
    ", we numerically solve the full 1-loop rges of the model ( see the appendix ) down to the seesaw scale , @xmath119 , at which the * 24 * fields decouple .",
    "then , we run the mssm rges down to the susy scale @xmath120 . for each point of the parameter space",
    ", we impose the following requirements : ( i ) successful ewsb and absence of tachyonic particles ; ( ii ) limits on susy masses from direct searches ; ( iii ) neutral lsp .",
    "then , we compute the leptonic processes by means of a full calculation in the mass eigenstate basis @xcite , the hadronic processes by means of the mass - insertion approximation formulae in @xcite , the lsp relic density using ` darksusy ` @xcite and the @xmath121 using ` susybsg ` @xcite .",
    "we require that the resulting @xmath121 do not deviate from the experimental value @xcite in more than 3@xmath122 .",
    "let us first try to extract information about the seesaw scale and the other seesaw parameters , focusing on the stringent bounds lfv can impose on them . in order to do that , we can start varying all the parameters in large ranges , but we clearly need a criterion for defining the susy spectrum we want to concentrate on ( all effects would be negligibly small , if we considered slepton masses of several tev ) . therefore , we will mostly concentrate on parameter regions giving sizable susy contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath123 , and , later on , also on regions which provide a dark matter relic density within the wmap constraints .    for simplicity , in the numerical analysis",
    "we have neglected possible @xmath5 mass - splittings among the fields in the * 24 * , inducing threshold corrections to the gauge coupling running , which would modify the mssm gauge coupling unification .",

    "according to the above formula , the consistency with the measured value for @xmath127 could be slightly worsened or improved .",
    "we notice that such modification of the running of the gauge couplings would have anyway a negligible impact on the running of the other parameters .",
    "moreover , the possible thresholds would affect the running of the soft masses , entering in the expressions of the flavour violating parameters , eqs .",

    "points provide a sizable susy contribution to @xmath123 , while the green ( light grey ) points give a neutralino relic density not larger than the cold dark matter relic density measured by wmap ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "we can see that the present bound on br@xmath128 still allows for a sizable ( up to 20@xmath16730 % of @xmath168 ) positive contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore we have br@xmath169 ( so within the sensitivity of meg ) for most of the points which provide such a solution to the @xmath3 tension , which would be therefore strongly disfavored by a negative result of meg .",
    "let us notice , however , that the parameter space points favored by wmap can not provide the desired increase of @xmath3 .",
    "the reason is that these points are mainly concentrated in the coannihilation region where @xmath170 or even @xmath171 , as we are going to discuss in the next section , so that the flavour violating @xmath108 result suppressed by large squark masses .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ek - spsiphi ] , we plot @xmath115 for the same scan of the parameters .",
    "as we can see , the predicted value do not deviate too much from the small sm prediction @xmath172 .",
    "the reason is that , even if the phase of @xmath173 can be large , @xmath174 is numerically too small ( cfr .",
    "for instance the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : drrestimate ] ) ) to provide a sizable cp violation in the @xmath4 mixing and thus accounting for the di - muon anomaly reported in @xcite .",
    "if such new physics effects in @xmath4 mixing will be confirmed , the minimal version of the model we are discussing here should be extended to include further sources of flavour violation in the hadronic sector .",
    "the presence of intermediate scale fields , which are charged under the sm gauge group , has a possible impact on the supersymmetric spectrum and , thus , on the parameter space regions , for which the relic density of the lsp ( in our case a bino - like lightest neutralino as in the cmssm ) results to be within the wmap bounds @xcite . in this section",
    ", we are going to focus on the so - called @xmath175 coannihilation region @xcite , since focus point @xcite and a - funnel @xcite are not expected to be qualitatively different with respect to the cmssm ( even if they can be quantitatively modified , even significantly , within this model ) .",
    "the effect we are going to discuss can be again traced back to the modification of the rg running of the parameters . in this case , however , this is not due to the new yukawa interactions ( since flavour bounds do not allow the couplings to be too large ) , but it is an effect of the modification of the running of the gauge couplings ( and the gaugino masses ) above the scale of the * 24*. in fact , even if the fields in the * 24 * do not spoil ( at least at 1-loop ) the successful gauge coupling unification of the mssm , the running gets `` stronger '' : above @xmath176 the 1-loop @xmath65-function coefficients gets indeed modified as follows : @xmath177 and the running of the gauge couplings is considerably deflected . as a consequence , even if the couplings unify at the usual mssm gut scale , @xmath178 gev , the value of the unified coupling @xmath179 gets larger than in the cmssm .",
    "clearly , an analogous effect happens to the gaugino masses , so that they reach values at @xmath61 , which can be considerably smaller than the unified value @xmath117 .",
    "this could be thought as a simple rescaling of @xmath117 ( since clearly the low - energy gaugino masses will be the same as in the cmssm with a lower value of @xmath117 ) , if it did not affect the scalar masses as well .",
    "in fact , with the same values of the gaugino masses at low energy , the scalar mass will feel a stronger gauge contribution to the running , through the gauge terms in the rges , @xmath180 , which are larger than in the cmssm between the gut scale and @xmath61 .",
    "the consequence in the low - energy susy spectrum is that the scalar masses will result relatively larger , with respect to the gaugino masses , than in the mssm .",
    "qualitatively , the above described effect is clearly common to all models that have fields charged under the sm gauge group at some intermediate scale , and it was , for instance , observed in the context of an @xmath181 type - ii seesaw model in @xcite and in a multi - scale flavour model in @xcite .",
    "coming back to dm , having relatively heavier scalars could destabilize the ordinary regions of the parameter space that provide a neutralino relic density within the wmap bounds and for which quite precise relations among parameters are usually required .",
    "an example is the @xmath182 coannihilation region , where the correct relic density is achieved thanks to an efficient @xmath182-@xmath183 coannihilation , which requires @xmath184 .",
    "as we are going to see , such region is strongly modified in our case , as an effect of the relatively heavier @xmath185 resulting from the strong gauge running below the gut scale .",
    "what can happen to the coannihilation region is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmps ] , where we show the @xmath76-@xmath117 plane for @xmath186 gev , @xmath187 , @xmath147 . the neutrino parameters ( not relevant for dm )",
    "were taken to be @xmath149 , @xmath188 .",
    "the region marked with red ( grey ) points gives @xmath189 .",
    "we can see that the cmssm region where @xmath190 , along which usually the coannihilation strip runs , has disappeared as a consequence of the effect described above , i.e. vanishing scalar masses at high - energy ( then generated through the running driven by the gaugino masses ) , such as in @xcite . this possibility has been recently addressed in @xcite . ] .",
    "coannihilation is still possible , since very low values of @xmath76 still gives @xmath184 , but , interestingly , such region is bounded from above : this means that this particular set - up of the parameters predicts an upper bound on the dm mass , in this case @xmath191 gev , as we can see from the figure taking into account that , for @xmath186 gev , the bino mass is approximately @xmath192 .",
    "a similar effect , providing an upper bound on @xmath193 , was found in @xcite , again as a consequence of the modification of the gauge contribution to the running of the scalar masses ( in that case an additional su(5 ) running of the parameters above the gut scale was taken into account ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmps ] , we have also plotted contours for @xmath194 , the lep limit on the higgs mass ( taking into account 3 gev of theoretical error ) , as well as the region which provides @xmath195 ( below the magenta dot - dashed line ) .",
    "we can see that the dm region is already partially excluded by the present limits on @xmath54 and on the higgs mass .",
    "the rest of the coannihilation region , which is , at least in part , consistent with a sizable @xmath196 , will be fully tested very soon by meg , since it gives @xmath197 .",
    "the prediction for the @xmath54 rate clearly depends on the parameter @xmath45 , which we have here taken @xmath198 .",
    "nevertheless , we checked that , varying the value of @xmath45 , still @xmath194 is predicted in the reach of the meg experiment ( i.e. @xmath199 ) in the coannihilation region , apart from few points where the combination of parameters happens to suppress the rate .",
    "finally , it is important to stress how the effect described above and its possible impact on the coannihilation region are sensitive to variations of the parameters , especially @xmath61 and @xmath142 . the effect would be clearly decreased , and would eventually disappear , by increasing @xmath61 , i.e. decreasing the length of the running and thus the value of @xmath179 , and vice - versa would become stronger for lower values of @xmath61 . a larger value of @xmath142 would contribute as usual to decrease the @xmath200 mass ( by increasing the negative contributions @xmath201 in the running and also the l - r mixing term in the @xmath175 mass matrix ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmps40 ] , where the @xmath202 case is shown .",
    "the parameter space is now qualitatively similar to the cmssm case : the region where @xmath200 is the lsp has reappeared and the coannihilation region is a strip along it .",
    "notice the presence for low values of @xmath76 and @xmath117 of a sizable `` bulk '' region ( which is smaller but still present also for @xmath129 ) .",
    "this region is , however , already excluded by several constraints , including the experimental limit on @xmath194 .",
    "in this paper we have considered a susy su(5 ) model where neutrino masses are obtained via a mixed type i+iii seesaw mechanism and we have studied its phenomenology assuming universal soft masses at the gut scale . the main characteristic of the model is the presence of one massless neutrino .",
    "then the high - energy seesaw parameters are less than in the three massive neutrinos case and therefore a higher degree of predictability is present .",
    "moreover , the model represents a very economical way of accounting for neutrino masses in a gut context , since the addition of just one chiral superfield in the su(5 ) adjoint representation is considered .",
    "besides discussing the model and in particular the mechanism through which we obtain two neutrino masses , we have analyzed the following features :    * @xmath203 and other lfv processes ; * possible contributions to hadronic observables ; * neutralino relic density .",
    "we have shown that we can have sizable contribution to the @xmath54 rate , such that the current experimental limit constrains the seesaw scale to be @xmath141  gev , while meg will be able to test the model down to scales of @xmath204 gev .",
    "we have also shown that the bounds on br(@xmath54 ) put strong constraints on br(@xmath157 ) , making very unlikely to observe it in future experiments .",
    "otherwise , a positive signal for the @xmath157 decay would disfavor this model .    from the bound on br(@xmath54 ) , we have been able to put an upper bound on im@xmath205 , for the seesaw scale @xmath148  gev .",
    "of course this bound is @xmath61-dependent , since a reduction in the scale would imply a decrease of the size of yukawas and then larger values for im(@xmath45 ) would be allowed . however , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , values of im(@xmath45 ) larger than 1 are unnatural since cancellations in the neutrino sector would be needed .",
    "the contribution in the hadronic sector is given by the coupling of the down - quark singlets with the new fields @xmath68 . even if this can not be directly related to the neutrino parameters , an order of magnitude estimate can be performed .",
    "we have shown that in this model the present bound on br@xmath128 still allows for a sizable ( up to 20@xmath16730 % of @xmath168 ) positive contribution to @xmath3 , which would help in accommodating a recently reported tension among different observables used to fit the unitarity triangle .",
    "on the other side , cp violation in the @xmath4 mixing turns out to be too small to be able to account for the di - muon anomaly reported by the d0 collaboration .    as for the neutralino relic density",
    ", we have focussed on the so - called @xmath175 coannihilation region .",
    "we have shown that the cmssm region where @xmath190 , along which usually the coannihilation strip runs , can disappear , so that the coannihilation region gets distorted .",
    "interestingly , such region is bounded from above , which means that an upper bound on the dm mass can be derived : for the particular set - up of the parameters considered here we got @xmath191  gev .",
    "moreover , the possibility of having @xmath206 ( with efficient coannihilation as well ) as high - energy boundary condition is now open .    in this paper we have not addressed other issues such as proton decay and leptogenesis .",
    "as for proton decay , this model does not improve the situation with respect to the standard case , so one has to rely on standard mechanisms to suppress the proton decay rate .",
    "for instance , in the context of the missing partner mechanism  @xcite for solving the doublet - triplet splitting problem , it is possible to build models in which the proton decay rate is sufficiently suppressed  @xcite .",
    "an extended higgs sector is required in that case . in principle , our model could be embedded in such extended su(5 ) framework . for a review about proton stability , including also a section about susy su(5 ) models , where further possibilities for suppressing the proton decay are discussed , we refer to  @xcite .    for what concerns leptogenesis",
    ", we argue that it can be realized in this model through the decay of the triplet or the singlet or both . however , since their exact masses are not determined from phenomenological constraints ( contrary to the non - susy case addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not clear who is the responsible for leptogenesis : actually a combined action of the two could be possible , since their masses are of the same order of magnitude . to derive a definite conclusion as well as bounds on the parameters , a dedicated study",
    "would then be needed , which is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "<S> we consider a supersymmetric su(5 ) model where two neutrino masses are obtained via a mixed type i+iii seesaw mechanism induced by the component fields of a single su(5 ) adjoint . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the phenomenology of the model paying particular attention to flavour violating processes and dark matter relic density , assuming universal boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , for a seesaw scale larger than @xmath0  gev , br@xmath1 is in the reach of the meg experiment in sizable regions of the parameter space . on the other side , current bounds on it force br@xmath2 to be well below the reach of forthcoming experiments , rendering thus the model disprovable if a positive signal is found . the same bounds still allow for a sizable positive contribution to @xmath3 , while the cp violation in the @xmath4 mixing turns out to be too small to account for the di - muon anomaly reported by the d0 collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the regions where the neutralino relic density is within the wmap bounds can be strongly modified with respect to the constrained mssm case . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a peculiar coannihilation region , bounded from above , can be realized , which allows us to put an upper bound on the dark matter mass for certain set - ups of the parameters . </S>"
