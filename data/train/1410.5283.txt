    "the general theory of gravitation describes the physical phenomena coming about in a strong gravitational field and the physical behaviour of the universe in a large - scale . at the same time",
    ", it has a remarkable mathematical and physical perspective .",
    "however , as our knowledge about the universe increases by new observational data , some new modified gravitation theories based on the theory are appeared to understand the reality of the universe .",
    "moreover , the quantisation of the theory still keeps standing the most important problem in physics .",
    "therefore , the general theory of gravitation is one of the most active research areas .    giving the observational data @xcite , the universe had been accelerated in early time which is called inflation . to investigate the cosmic inflation of the universe or the beginning of expansion ,",
    "the standard cosmological models were used @xcite .",
    "another cosmic acceleration of the universe occurs in the late - time universe and confirms various observational evidences which are the observations of supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , and large - scale structure @xcite . to clarify such an accelerated expansion , many authors introduced mysterious cosmic fluid , the so - called dark energy .",
    "it has been proposed severel models in the literature such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 gravity @xcite . recently , to understand the problem in 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime , it has been realized that fermionic or dirac fields as a gravitational source which cause inflationary period in early universe and dark energy in old universe are being considered @xcite . in this connection , sousa and",
    "kremer @xcite have analysed a model with dirac field that is non - minimally coupled to the gravity in the @xmath5 dimensional .",
    "they have utilized noether symmetry approach to determine the forms of the potential and the coupling function to show dependence on dirac fields in the model .",
    "noether symmetry approach firstly introduced by cappoziello et al .",
    "@xcite to find new cosmological solutions in the @xmath5 dimensional gravity has been used to determine the shape of the potential and the coupling function dynamically in the scalar - tensor gravity theory .",
    "it is important to note that this approach gives us constants of motion ( first integral ) for the dynamical equation .",
    "recently , this approach has been extensively studied in various cosmological models i.e. , in scalar field cosmology @xcite , @xmath6 metric and palatini theory @xcite , @xmath7 theory @xcite , telleparalel dark energy model @xcite .",
    "all of these studies , it has been considered the noether symmetry approach without a gauge term .",
    "if one consider the gauge term , then he may expect extra symmetries which yield a new constants of motion , but the term makes the calculations more complicating .",
    "the general theory of gravitation in @xmath5 dimensions is very difficult because it has complicated calculations .",
    "however , in @xmath0 dimensional spacetime , it takes much more simple form because weyl tensor vanishes and riemann tensor is reduced to ricci tensor .",
    "moreover , the version in the @xmath0 dimensions also contains the physical results in the @xmath5 dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 dimensional spacetime becomes a perfect theoretical laboratory to construct new modified gravitation theories .",
    "in particular , if one wants to probe the mathematical and physical properties of the universe in the @xmath0 dimensional spacetime by using dirac spinor fields as a gravitational source , one can simply describe the properties of the universe according to its analogous @xmath5 dimensional spacetime because dirac spinor fields with 4-components in the @xmath5 dimensional spacetime are also reduced to the 2-components spinor fields corresponding one negative and one positive energy states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dirac spinorial fields can give us useful information about inflation in the early time of the universe because dirac theory has vacuum which includes zitterbewegung oscillations between positive and negative energy states .",
    "also , the theory perfectly describe an interaction between dirac particles and matter .",
    "therefore , dirac spinorial fields can probe how to expand the universe in late time .    from these points of view",
    ", we want to study the dirac fields as a source of early - time inflation and late - time acceleration in @xmath0 dimensional gravity for friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background by using noether gauge symmetry approach .",
    "the results to be performed in this study are important in consequence of the @xmath0 dimensional gravity and dirac theory , because they give information about the expansion of the universe in early and late time .",
    "also , it will be first example carried out , in regarding gravity and dirac fields by using noether gauge symmetry method .",
    "therefore , the study will satisfy a motivations for new studies in the @xmath0 dimensional gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we give the field equations of a theory in which the dirac field is non - minimal coupled to the gravity in the @xmath0 dimensions . in section [ ns ] , we search the noether gauge symmetry for the lagrangian of the theory with the dirac field . in section [ fieldeqns ] , we obtain the solutions of the field equations by using noether gauge symmetry approach . finally ,",
    "in the section [ conc ] , we conclude with a summary of the obtained results . throughout the paper ,",

    "we note that the first integral ( [ frsti-1 ] ) is related with the energy function ( [ hamilton ] ) , so that the first integral @xmath112 vanishes .",
    "since the coupling function @xmath113 depends on the bilinear function @xmath46 , from dirac s equations ( [ dirac1 ] ) and ( [ dirac2 ] ) one gets @xmath114 which integrates to give @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a constant of integration . inserting the equation ( [ sol2 ] ) into the first integral equation ( [ frsti-3 ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath117 . considering the equations ( [ sol2 ] ) and the coupling function ( [ coupling ] ) , the first integral ( [ frsti-2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath118 where we define @xmath119 , and @xmath120 . now",

    "we obtain a constraint relations between the constants as @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the solution for the cosmic scale factor that is obtained from the noether gauge symmetry represents a power law expansion for the universe .",
    "it is remarkable from ( [ scale1 ] ) that models with model parameter @xmath124 obey an accelerated power law expansion while for @xmath125 a decelerated expansion occurs . for @xmath126",

    "for this purpose we can define the equation of state parameter of the fermionic field by using the energy density ( [ ener ] ) and pressure ( [ pressure ] ) as @xmath129 . considering the equations ( [ coupling ] ) , ( [ pot1 ] ) , ( [ sol2 ] ) and ( [ scale1 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath130 according to astrophysical data , the equation of state parameter tend to value @xmath131 . for the equation of state parameter",

    "the universe is both expanding and accelerating .",
    "therefore , the results show that the fermionic field may behave like both quintessence and phantom dark energy field in the late - time universe .    now , we return the case @xmath136 so that the coupling and potential functions have linear forms of @xmath46 from the equation ( [ coupling ] ) and ( [ pot1 ] ) as follows @xmath137 @xmath138 for this case , we do not need to the first integral obtained by noether gauge symmetry approach because the friedman equation ( [ fried ] ) and acceleration equation ( [ acce ] ) can be directly integrated by usually method .",

    "it is clear that this solution describes an inflationary period , where the cosmic scale factor increases exponentially with the cosmic time .",

    "the solutions of the field equations for frw spacetime are presented by using the results obtained from the noether gauge symmetry approach .",
    "it is shown that in the general case @xmath101 , the dirac field play role of the dark energy in the late - time universe .",
    "for the special case @xmath126 , the solution of dynamical equation describes a decelerated universe with a matter dominated behavior in @xmath0 dimension .",
    "we also consider a model where the coupling function and the potential have linear forms of @xmath46 ( i.e. the case @xmath136 ) .",
    "for such a model , the cosmological solution describes an inflationary period for the early - time universe .",
