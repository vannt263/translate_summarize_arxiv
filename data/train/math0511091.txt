    "the energy density of high frequency waves propagating in highly heterogeneous media can be modeled by a fokker - planck equation in the phase space , i.e. , the space of positions and momenta .",
    "we refer to e.g. @xcite for a mathematical derivation of such a macroscopic model for the wave energy density .",
    "the main assumption on the heterogeneous medium is that it is a random medium with a very large correlation length relative to the typical wavelength in the system .",
    "the fokker - planck equation may be seen as a highly - peaked - forward - scattering approximation to the radiative transfer equations , which are also used in the modeling of the energy density of waves in heterogeneous media when correlation length and wavelength are comparable ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such macroscopic models for waves in random media can more generally be used to quantify the correlation function of two wave fields propagating in possibly two different media @xcite .",
    "this has applications in the temporal monitoring of the statistical properties of random media as well as in the analysis of the refocusing of time reversed waves @xcite .",
    "this paper analyzes the effect of changes in the random media on the two - field correlation . in the fokker - planck regime",
    ", the two - field correlation decays as the two media separate and we present a quantitative estimate of such a decay .",
    "although the results in this paper generalize to fairly large classes of waves such as e.g. , acoustic waves as in @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic waves , and elastic waves ( see @xcite ) we restrict ourselves to the case of a scalar schrdinger equation to simplify .",
    "this models the effect of heterogeneities on a single particle represented by a quantum wave function .",
    "the changes in the heterogeneous medium considered here are sufficiently small so that the correlation of the two fields , one propagating in the unperturbed medium and the other one propagation in the perturbed medium , still satisfies a random liouville equation in the high frequency limit .",
    "however , solutions of the liouville equation are no longer real and have a complex phase .",
    "their phase is responsible for the decoherence of the two wave fields , and is driven by the media mismatch .",
    "the evolution of the correlation function is described in terms of the particle position @xmath0 , momentum @xmath1 and phase difference @xmath2 .",
    "the techniques used in @xcite are then applied to this new random liouville equation to study the limit of the joint process @xmath3 .",
    "the limiting equation , of fokker - planck type , is obtained in the vanishing limit of the correlation length @xmath4 of the heterogeneous medium .",
    "its derivation is based on the mixing properties of the bi - characteristics of a random hamiltonian , as in @xcite , and on the mixing properties of a highly oscillatory functional of such bi - characteristics , which is the main new result obtained in this paper .",
    "in particular , we show that the phase difference @xmath2 converges to a brownian motion on the real line .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : rmle ] presents the random schrdinger equations and the limiting random liouville equation for the wigner transform of the two wave fields , which is the fourier transform in the difference variable of the correlation function of the two fields .",
    "we also review in section [ sub : review ] the results obtained in @xcite while adapting them to the case of a random schrdinger equation . finally , in section [",
    "sub : formal ] we derive the generalized fokker - planck equations ( see below ) by formal analysis . section [ sec : liouv ] presents theorem [ thm - new ] , the main result of this paper that describes the limit of the joint process @xmath3 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation is deduced from the limiting law ( as the correlation length of the random medium goes to zero ) .",
