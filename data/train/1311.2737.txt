    "following batyrev s seminal article ( @xcite ) , there exists a mirror partner of @xmath6 , which is given as follows .",

    "only a hodge - theoretic mirror partner , i.e. , the relevant hodge numbers of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are exchanged , namely : @xmath14    let @xmath15 be a finite group of automorphisms of @xmath0 that acts freely on @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath16 is a calabi - yau threefold with non - trivial fundamental group .",

    "more precisely , let @xmath19 and consider pairs @xmath9 , where @xmath6 is a calabi - yau threefold in @xmath0 and @xmath15 is a finite group of automorphisms of @xmath0 that acts freely on @xmath6 with the maximum possible order .",
    "these pairs are first investigated in ( @xcite ) , where they are called _ maximal admissible pairs_. for each of them there exists a calabi - yau threefold @xmath20 with non - trivial fundamental group and relevant hodge numbers @xmath21 .",
    "a ( hodge - theoretic ) mirror partner of @xmath8 should have    @xmath22    and height @xmath23 , where the height is defined as the sum of the two hodge numbers above .    in this",

    "an anticanonical section @xmath7 of the resolution is a smooth calabi - yau , which is a mirror of @xmath6 .    in order to find subgroups of @xmath25 , we recall the structure of the automorphism group of a toric variety ( cfr .",

    "none of them acts without fixed points ; furthermore , the fixed locus is the union of some curves .",
    "therefore , a mirror - if it exists - can not be found in this way . of course , the quotients by the groups described above have finite quotient singularities , and there exists a mirror calabi - yau orbifold that satisfies ( ) .",
    "if we take an crepant resolution of the orbifold mentioned before , we get a smooth calabi - yau manifold with height @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is a mirror partner ( at least hodge - theoretically ) of a quotient in ( @xcite ) , which is a calabi - yau manifold with cyclic fundamental group of order four : see remark ( [ osette ] ) .",
    "finally , in section ( [ sec : mir ] ) , we prove that it is indeed possible to find hodge - theoretic mirror pairs by taking quotients associated to admissible pairs in @xmath0 and in @xmath3 if the admissible pair in @xmath0 is not maximal .",
    "more precisely , we construct three pair @xmath28 of hodge - theoretic calabi - yau mirrors with @xmath29 associated to an admissible pair in @xmath0 and @xmath30 associated to an admissible pair in @xmath3 .",

    "hence , it suffices to analyse the action of @xmath176 on @xmath258 .",
