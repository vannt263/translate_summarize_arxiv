    "the initial state in the calculation of the gp equation is taken as the vortex configuration with the hexagonal symmetry which is the most favored configuration in rotating scalar bec s , corresponding to the high magnetization limit @xmath189 .",
    "the resulting equilibrium state consists of the vortices filling the cores with the polar state and keeps the hexagonal symmetry . as shown in fig .",

    "the spatial variation of the spin texture becomes broader than the order of the density variation @xmath123 and the correlation between neighboring vortices plays an essential role . as the result ,",
