    "<S> ) are not negligible at such low scales as @xmath89gev . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this fact indicates that an important part of the diffractive parton densities comes from the relatively small size components of the ` pomeron ' . </S>",

    "<S> note that the direct pomeron contribution at large @xmath92 , mostly the twist - four @xmath96 , only gives an important contribution to the total @xmath83 for @xmath97 , but the contribution to the @xmath98 slope starts becoming important at moderate @xmath92 . </S>",

    "<S> the diffractive gluon density is mainly determined by the derivative @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these additional positive contributions to the @xmath98 slope at large @xmath92 apart from the usual dglap contribution means that a smaller gluon density is required for @xmath100 compared to the h1 2006 fit a performed in the usual regge factorisation framework @xcite ; see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : graph](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution , which goes to a constant value as @xmath103 , was calculated in @xcite and turns out to be numerically appreciable . for the coupling to massless quarks , this contribution to takes the form @xcite @xmath104 differentiating with respect to @xmath105 </S>",
    "<S> gives a positive term from the integrand evaluated at @xmath106 , analogous to the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation , in addition to the negative term proportional to @xmath107 obtained from taking the derivative of the integrand .    </S>",

    "<S> it is found that the twist - four @xmath108 term gives a negative contribution to the @xmath98 slope , such that a larger gluon distribution at high @xmath109 is needed than in the usual regge factorisation approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , the contribution from @xmath110 is already included in the input pomeron pdfs taken at a scale @xmath111 gev@xmath35 , so some double - counting is involved . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dglap evolution is not accounted for in the dipole cross section , and the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation of the dpdfs is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the future measurement of @xmath96 @xcite will provide an important check of the calculations of the twist - four component .    </S>",
    "<S> the smaller diffractive gluon density at high @xmath109 found in our analysis , compared to the h1 2006 fit a , is preferred by the data on inclusive diffractive dijet production , @xmath112 , where at lo the dijet system originates from the outgoing @xmath29 pair in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the apparent tension between the inclusive ddis and dijet data in the regge factorisation approach is partly alleviated by the inclusion of the perturbative pomeron terms .    </S>",
    "<S> note that in the ` mrw 2006 ' analysis @xcite the parton distributions of the proton , representing the lower parton ladders in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : graph](a , b ) , were taken from a nlo global fit . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the pomeron - to - parton splitting is only calculated at lo , it may be more appropriate to take the inclusive parton distributions from a lo fit , where the gluon density is much larger at small @xmath6 and does not take a valence - like form at low scales . in this case , the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equation , and the other direct pomeron contributions , would be enhanced , leading to an even smaller diffractive gluon density at high @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> note that even if lo dglap evolution is used in the lower parton ladders of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : graph](a , b ) , nlo dglap evolution may still be used for the evolution of the pomeron pdfs in the upper parts of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : graph](a , c ) .    a more direct way to observe the perturbative pomeron contribution to ddis </S>",
    "<S> is to study the transverse momenta of secondaries in the ` pomeron fragmentation ' region , at the edge of the lrg , as in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> in contrast with the regge factorisation of fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : graph](a ) the @xmath33-distribution of the lowest jet in fig.[fig : graph](a ) obeys a power law , given by the integrand of . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect a larger @xmath33 of the secondaries with the long power - like tail .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , measurements of inclusive diffractive dijets at hera have primarily been made in the kinematic region of small @xmath115 where the resolved pomeron mechanism of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : graph](a , c ) gives the dominant contribution , and the contribution from exclusive diffractive dijets , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : graph](b ) , is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , a first measurement has been made of dijets in ddis with a cut on @xmath116 in order to enhance the contribution from exclusive diffractive dijets , @xmath117 @xcite . within the hera kinematic domain </S>",
    "<S> the sea - quark component of the pomeron is quite important ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : break ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this statement can be checked by observing the diffractive high-@xmath118 dijet distributions in the exclusive @xmath119 process . at </S>",
    "<S> lo we expect the ratio of cross sections for high-@xmath118 dijets produced via the two - gluon ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 @xmath11-channel exchange to be  @xcite @xmath122 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the photon s light - cone momentum fraction carried by the high-@xmath118 jet , and the scale @xmath124 . therefore , measurements of exclusive diffractive dijets at large @xmath118 in photoproduction would probe the presence of the @xmath29 @xmath11-channel exchange . </S>",
    "<S> however , it remains to be seen whether a measurement of exclusive diffractive dijets is feasible without imposing a cut on @xmath92 .    in summary , we have shown how to obtain _ universal _ diffractive parton densities @xmath14 which can be used in the description of different diffractive processes . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise that the perturbative qcd contribution originated by the inhomogeneous ( last ) term in is not small and , starting from a relatively low scale @xmath125gev , may generate up to a third of the diffractive parton densities . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , an account of this inhomogeneous term , and the twist - four @xmath108 contribution , leads to a lower diffractive gluon density at high @xmath109 in comparison to that obtained using the regge factorisation hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the perturbative ( large scale ) contributions reveals itself in larger transverse momenta ( with a power - like tail ) of the secondaries observed in the ` pomeron fragmentation ' region . </S>",
    "<S> the colour singlet sea - quark pair exchange is an important component of the perturbative pomeron , which plays the dominant role in exclusive diffractive dijet production with @xmath126 . </S>",
