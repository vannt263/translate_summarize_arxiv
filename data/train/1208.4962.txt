    "recently the study of quantum spin chains from the perspective of quantum information theory attracted considerable attention .",
    "this applies in particular to entanglement studies of quantum spin chains in their ground state @xmath3 . in these studies",

    "the entanglement @xmath10 is particularly interesting to study in the context of critical quantum chains with an underlying conformal symmetry  @xcite , which are characterized by long - range correlations in the ground state . using methods of conformal field theory it was shown in @xcite that the entanglement in such systems obeys the scaling form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total length of the chain , @xmath13 is the length of section @xmath4 , and @xmath14 is a scaling function . in this expression",
    "the constant @xmath15 is non - universal , meaning that it depends on the specific microscopic realization of the respective model , while the constant @xmath16 turns out to be universal .",
    "remarkably , @xmath16 is equal to the so - called central charge of the underlying conformal field theory which labels the universality class .",
    "for example , the ising universality class is characterized by the central charge @xmath17 .     and @xmath5 , the respective spin configurations will be correlated , expressed in terms of the mutual information @xmath18 .",
    "[ spinchain],width=377 ]    to determine the entanglement experimentally one has to perform a variety of repeated measurements acting simultaneously on all spins in one of the sectors . such as task",
    "is usually difficult to perform .",
    "in fact , it would be much simpler to measure individual spin orientations locally and to study the resulting classical spin configurations .",
    "such a measurement is expected to destroy the existing entanglement and to convert it to some extent into classical correlations between the two parts of the system .",
    "such classical correlations are usually quantified by the mutual information @xmath19 where the terms on the right hand side denote the shannon entropy of the classical spin configurations after the measurement in the sections @xmath20 and in the whole chain .    in this paper",
    "we address the question to what extent the quantum entanglement and the classical mutual information are related to each other .",
    "the main results are :    * in the quantum ising model the mutual information obeys the same scaling law  ( [ entanglement ] ) as the entanglement at the critical point , although with a different prefactor . *",
    "the mutual information obeys the inequality @xmath21 for general bipartite systems in a pure state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we first discuss the example of the quantum ising chain , determining the entanglement and the mutual information in finite - size systems by different methods . in sect .",

    "the ground state of this model exhibits an order - disorder phase transition at the critical point @xmath30 : at @xmath31 all spins are aligned in one direction of the @xmath32 axis , and as @xmath28 is increased the magnetization is weakened and vanishes at @xmath25 , which means that the system goes to the paramagnetic phase in the @xmath32 direction at @xmath33 .    to obtain the mutual information of classical spin configurations in the ground state",
    ", we have to compute the probability for each classical configuration after a measurement of local spin orientations .",
    "if we choose the @xmath32 axis for the spin orientations , measuring @xmath34 , these probabilities can be computed from the coefficients of the ground state wave function @xmath35 represented in the product basis of the eigenvectors of @xmath36 .",
    "for example , if we consider an ising chain with two spins in the ground state @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the product basis of the eigenvectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 of @xmath41 , the probability @xmath42 to obtain the classical configuration @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "to determine the ground state of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham : ising ] ) at finite @xmath12 , we use the lanczos method  @xcite .    each classical configuration obtained from the measurement",
    "is now divided into two segments , @xmath46 . determining the shannon entropy of the probability distribution in the segments and in the whole chain , @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49",
