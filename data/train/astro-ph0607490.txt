    "beginning in 2004 july , with hst / nicmos , we initiated a systematic imaging search for extra - solar gas giant planets around 116 young nearby stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "these targets are @xmath6myr old and located within 60pc of earth , making them among the best known targets for such a survey @xcite .    a brown dwarf in the @xmath5myr old tw  hydrae association , 2masswj1207334@xmath1393254 ( @xcite ; hereafter 2m1207 ) ,",
    "was included in our hst target list and its observation was planned for 2005 april . however , on 2004 apr 27 ( ut ) , 2m1207 was observed with vlt / naco and a faint companion candidate was discovered @xmath7 from the brown dwarf @xcite .",
    "nicmos observations of 2m1207 were replanned and brought forward to 2004 august .",
    "the resulting nicmos photometric data , shorter in wavelength than could be obtained with adaptive optics on the vlt , support the conjecture that 2m1207b is of mid- to late - l type based upon its color indices . with the limited precision of the proper motion data",
    "then available for 2m1207 and the short time between the vlt and 2004 august hst observations , common proper motion with 2m1207b was established at the @xmath8 level @xcite .",
    "additional observations were obtained with the vlt during 2005 february and march that much more precisely demonstrated common proper motion between 2m1207 and its companion @xcite . as described in section 4.1 ,",
    "the proper motion value of 2m1207 @xcite used in @xcite was not well measured , causing the analysis to be somewhat over - optimistic .    with the higher accuracy hst astrometry and a new , more accurate , proper motion measurement of 2m1207 in the present paper",
    ", we report a more definitive common proper motion between 2m1207 and 2m1207b .",
    "we also present short near - ir wavelength diagnostic photometry which can not currently be obtained from the ground given the performance limitations of adaptive optics imaging .",
    "hst near - ir observations of 2m1207 were obtained with nicmos camera 1 ( @xmath9mas / pixel ) at two observational epochs : 2004 aug 28 and 2005 apr 26 . at each epoch , 2m1207 was observed at two field orientations ( spacecraft roll angles ) in successive hst orbits to permit self - subtractions of the rotationally invariant psf , thereby significantly increasing the visibility of the nearby companion . direct imaging in camera 1 , rather than",
    "coronagraphy in camera 2 , was planned due to the @xmath7 angular separation of 2m1207 and its putative planetary - mass companion and the relatively benign contrast ratios expected based on the vlt observations .",
    "nicmos camera 1 provides shorter wavelength diagnostic filters than camera 2 with a commensurately finer pixel scale to permit critical sampling of the psf at short near - ir wavelengths .",
    "details of the nicmos observations are listed in table  1 .",
    "raw multiaccum frames were converted to count - rate images with an idl - based analog to the stsdas calnica task , using calibration reference files developed by the nicmos instrument definition team and the space telescope science institute . known defective pixels ( under - responsive due to particulate contamination , and those with excessive dark currents )",
    "were replaced by two - dimensional gaussian weighted interpolation of good neighbor pixels ( with wavelength dependent weighting radii of the psf fwhm for the filters employed ) .",
    "dark subtracted , linearity - corrected , flat - fielded , cosmic ray rejected count - rate images were post - processed to remove additional well - characterized detector artifacts .",
    "for each filter in each visit , the four images were astrometrically registered to the position of the first image .",
    "position offsets were taken as reported in the downlinked spacecraft telemetry , through the cd matrices in the science data file headers , and verified by gaussian profile fitting and image centroiding of the 2m1207 psf image cores . image registration was accomplished via sinc function apodized bicubic interpolation , rebinning the interpolated images into a two times finer spatially resampled grid .",
    "then , images were median combined to create better sampled , higher s / n , and defect minimized count - rate images suitable for psf subtraction and of high photometric fidelity . details of the data calibration and processing methodologies are discussed in @xcite .",
    "photometry of 2m1207b was carried out after reducing the light of the primary star by subtracting the dither combined image at the second field orientation from the first .",
    "this roll subtraction virtually eliminated the spatially variable light from the primary outside of @xmath10 , leaving a positive and negative image of 2m1207b displaced by the differential field rotation .",
    "since the psfs of the companion partially overlap in this difference image , model psfs were created to fit and null out actual image psfs separately by adjusting position and flux density .",
    "this created an image at each orientation with the primary removed and only one companion remaining .",
    "these two images of the companion were then rotated by the appropriate spacecraft roll angle and combined ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the model psfs were created using tinytim 6.1a @xcite , which produces high fidelity filter and position dependent model psfs for hst instruments .",
    "the in - band flux densities ( and vega system magnitudes ) of 2m1207 were established from the unsubtracted , dither combined images resulting from each orbit independently . to verify the model psf subtraction method used",
    "to determine the companion magnitudes , we measured the primary magnitudes both with flux - scaled model psf subtraction , and with background subtracted aperture photometry ( corrected to an infinite aperture ) .",
    "the measured f090 m and f160w magnitudes at the two nicmos epochs are consistent ( table 2 ) , and flux - weighted mean apparent magnitudes from both epoch measurments are @xmath11mag and @xmath12mag , respectively .",
    "the nicmos camera 1 pixel scales applicable to both epochs of our 2m1207 observations are : x scale = 43.190 mas / pixel , y scale = 43.016 mas / pixel .",
    "the median combined calibrated count rate images were geometrically corrected to yield flux - conserved resampled pixels of 43.190 mas / pixel in both axes .",
    "all astrometric measures were made on the geometrically corrected images .",
    "the location of the primary was measured from the combined image by gaussian profile fitting of the primary s psf core .",
    "we also measured the position of a serendipitously appearing field star , which could be used for future epoch differential proper motion measures of 2m1207 itself ( table 3 ) .",
    "the locations of the companion , one from each field orientation at each epoch , were determined by the position offsets of the model psf implants used to null the companion images .",
    "the relative positions of 2m1207 and its companion were transformed to position angle ( pa ; degrees east of north ) and angular separation ( in mas ) based upon the well established hst / nicmos focal plane metrology ( aperture orientation in the telescope focal plane ) , the celestial orientation of the spacecraft , and the detector x / y image scales of nicmos camera 1 .",
    "in figure  [ colors]a , @xmath13 and @xmath14 colors of 2m1207 and b ( table  2 ) are compared to those of model calculations  `` dusty model '' [ @xcite ] and `` clear model '' [ @xcite ]  and field m , l , and t dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "our red colors are consistent with @xcite who noted 2m1207b has a very red color ( @xmath15mag ) even compared to most known l dwarfs . our colors for 2m1207b fall in between two extreme model cases indicating that dust clouds significantly affect its atmosphere .",
    "ab  pic  b , a @xmath16 jupiter mass ( ) young planetary ( or brown dwarf ) companion to the @xmath17myr old k2v star , ab  pic @xcite , also has unusually red near - ir colors for an l1 dwarf ( figure  [ colors]b ) .",
    "a field l - dwarf , 2mass j01415823@xmath14633574 , with very low surface gravity also shows very red near - ir colors @xcite . in each of these cases , the unusual redness of these objects",
    "must be related to low surface gravity due to youth and this extreme red color can be used to identify young brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .    with our estimated distance of @xmath3pc ( see section  5 ) ,",
    "f090 m & f160w absolute magnitudes imply a mass of @xmath18  for 2m1207b ( `` dusty '' model : @xmath19  and `` clear '' model : @xmath20 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the best estimated mass of 2m1207b from a color - color diagram ( figure  [ colors]a ) is @xmath21 . from these mass ranges , the mass of 2m1207b",
    "is estimated to be @xmath22  and the temperature corresponding to this mass range is @xmath23k .",
    "our estimated mass is consistent with the earlier estimate by @xcite from hkl@xmath24 photometric data ( @xmath25 ) which was based on a larger distance ( 70pc ) .",
    "the fact that we derive the same estimated mass with a smaller distance indicates that 2m1207b is brighter at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , f090 m ) than model predictions which implies a bluer @xmath13 color than expected .",
    "unusually red @xmath26 and blue @xmath13 colors could indicate that 2m1207b is somewhat subluminous in the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) band compared to models and to field l dwarfs .",
    "@xcite estimated the proper motion and @xmath29 . while it is true that the number of arc seconds to go once around in ra changes as a function of declination ( so the need of the @xmath30 term ) , that is all that changes .",
    "offsets , proper motions , etc given in arc second are not dependent on declination .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary or even correct to use a notation @xmath29 for proper motions given in arc second per year as in hipparcos , tycho-2 , ucac2 , etc . here",
    "we follow precedent as well established by @xcite in his catalog of nearby stars , and list proper motions in arc seconds per year . ] of 2m1207 as , @xmath31mas / yr , using positions from supercosmos , 2mass , and denis catalogs and from the chandra database . as there are large differences in the accuracy between the supercosmos , 2mass , and denis positions ( e.g. , @xmath32mas for 2mass versus @xmath33mas for supercosmos ) , a precise and reliable estimation of proper motion was difficult to obtain @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated proper motions of 2m1207 ( @xmath34)mas / yr using positions from the same set of catalogs as in @xcite excepting the problematic chandra pointing position .",
    "mamajek s calculation takes into account the positional errors of input catalog positions and his derived proper motions are overlapping , within errors , with our proper motion measurements described below .",
    "however , as discussed in section  5 , there are some caveats with respect to the analysis by @xcite .",
    "a more precise measurement of 2m1207 s proper motion was obtained in the following manner .",
    "on 2005 mar 2 , a single 120 second exposure @xmath35-band image of the field surrounding 2m1207 was obtained at a parallactic angle of @xmath36 utilizing the tektronix @xmath37 ccd camera on the university of hawaii 2.2 meter telescope at mauna kea observatory .",
    "the measured fwhm of point sources in the frame was 1@xmath381 ( 5 pixels ) .",
    "an archival image , observed on 1978 may 2 , was retrieved from the supercosmos sky survey database , where a digitized scan was extracted from a uk schmidt telescope plate .",
    "because the @xmath35-band frame was obtained through high airmass ( 3.3 ) and 2m1207 is considerably redder than other objects in the frame , differential atmospheric refraction could affect the estimated proper motions @xcite .",
    "the iraf task synphot was used to calculate the shift in effective wavelength between a typical field star ( average g8 ) and 2m1207 ( m8 ) , resulting in a @xmath39 shift in the cousins @xmath40-band filter . at the observed elevation of @xmath41 , this shift from @xmath42 to @xmath43 yields a differential refraction of @xmath44 mas ( howell 2000 ) which is small compared to the centroid shift of @xmath45mas over 27 years",
    "moreover , howell s calculation is for an altitude of 2.2 km whereas our measurement was done at an altitude of 4.1 km , thus the true differential atmospheric refraction effect should be smaller than 50mas .",
    "about sixty point sources were selected within the common @xmath46 field of view of the @xmath35-band image and the 1978.33 supercosmos image .",
    "these point sources have centroids that are measured with robust s / n ( @xmath47 , unsaturated ) and without obvious proper motion when blinking with the 2005 @xmath35-band image",
    ". the centroid coordinates of the sources together with those of 2m1207 were entered into the iraf routine geomap which calculates a general coordinate transformation , including rotation and distortion . the deviation (",
    "while excluded from the calculation ) of 2m1207 from the resulting coordinate transformation should be its relative motion with respect to the field sources , whose residuals give a measurement of the standard error .",
    "the resulting proper motion of 2m1207 is calculated to be @xmath48mas / yr and @xmath49mas / yr .    in order to assess the proper motion of 2m1207 without the effects of differential atmospheric refraction , another i - band image was obtained on 2006 july 8 ( 2006.52 ) at the siding spring observatory 1 meter telescope using the wide field imager .",
    "a 480 second exposure was taken at airmass=1.06 ( elevation 71 deg ) with measured point source fwhms=@xmath50 ( 4 pixels ) . at this elevation",
    ", there should be negligible differential atmospheric refraction . using the method described above against the 1978.33 epoch supercosmos image with 62 point sources in common , we calculate @xmath51mas / yr and @xmath52mas / yr which is in good agreement with the analysis above .    a final proper motion value is estimated from the weighted average of the 1978/2005 and 1978/2006 epoch values : @xmath53mas / yr and @xmath54mas / yr . the listed errors at each epoch are the scatter in field sources produced by geomap . for a distance of 59pc ,",
    "the annual parallax of 2m1207 of 17mas has negligible effect on our calculation because the 1978/2005/2006 measurements were obtained during similar seasons of the year .",
    "furthermore , even for the worst case ( 17mas offset for the 27 year baseline ) , this effect is much less than the random centroiding error .",
    "measured separations between 2m1207 and 2m1207b from the hst and vlt are listed in table  3",
    ". due to the proper motion of the primary , relative positions between the primary and a stationary background object should change over time as illustrated in figure  3 . because the 2004 aug 28 hst observation has the best positional measurement accuracy ,",
    "all other positions are plotted relative to it .",
    "if the planetary mass companion candidate seen in the 2004 aug 28 image had been a stationary background source , then its position relative to 2m1207 would have changed along the black line of figure  3 . as clearly shown in figure  3 and table  3 , 2m1207 and its planetary mass companion ( 2m1207b )",
    "are comoving , indicative of a gravitationally bound pair .",
    "the weighted mean offset position of 2m1207b relative to 2m1207 from hst and vlt images is @xmath55mas and @xmath56mas . comparing this against the expected position for a background object at epoch 2005 apr 26 , @xmath57mas , @xmath58mas , we find the two positions differ by 16.2@xmath2 .",
    "using only the hst images , the level drops to 16.0@xmath2 which is an unambiguous independent confirmation of the proper motion companionship of 2m1207 and 2m1207b .",
    "uncertainties in background object position were calculated using our improved proper motions and distance ( @xmath59pc , see section  5 for details on distance estimation ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the mass of 2m1207b falls in the planetary range ( @xmath60 ) . to prove this conjecture one must establish that ( 1 ) 2m1207 is very young , i.e. , a member of the @xmath5myr old tw hydrae association and ( 2 ) 2m1207 and 2m1207b are gravitationally bound .",
    "provided that ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are true , then chauvin et al ( 2004 , 2005 ) describe how two , essentially independent , techniques  evolutionary modeling and surface gravity analysis  both yield masses for 2m1207b well below 13.6 . in figure  3 and table  3 of the present paper ,",
    "we establish with high confidence that 2m1207 and 2m1207b are gravitationally bound .",
    "thus , only membership of 2m1207 in the twa remains to be considered .",
    "chauvin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) list a variety of reasons ( their section 3.1 ) why 2m1207 is a member of the twa .",
    "we can now strengthen their argument . on - going keck nirspec spectroscopic surveys of brown dwarfs ,",
    "both old and young , corroborate earlier measurements ( mentioned in @xcite ) indicating low surface gravity in 2m1207 , characteristic of @xmath61myr brown dwarf .",
    "@xcite report a detection of [ oi ] emission , which indicates a mass outflow from 2m1207 , as well as a detection of accretion shock - induced uv emission ( see their section 5.1 for details ) .",
    "all these strongly support that 2m1207 is indeed a young accreting brown dwarf .    using our new determination of the proper motion of 2m1207",
    ", we can derive a more reliable estimate of the distance to 2m1207 than was available to chauvin  et  al .",
    "twa members hr  4796a and 2m1207 lie very close together in the plane of the sky and , thus , should have proper motions which differ only according to their relative distances from earth .",
    "the proper motion of hr  4796a is given in the tycho 2 catalog ( @xmath62mas / yr , @xmath63mas / yr ) . we used tycho-2 proper motions over published , ostensibly more precise , hipparcos values because hipparcos proper motion uncertainties seem to have been underestimated ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "from the ratio of total proper motions of hr  4796a and 2m1207 ( 1.144:1.000 ) and using the hipparcos measured distance to hr  4796a ( @xmath64pc ) , we deduce a distance to 2m1207 of @xmath3pc . at this distance ,",
    "the projected separation of 2m1207b from 2m1207 is @xmath4au .",
    "our proper motion based method to derive the distance to 2m1207 can be tested on twa 25 which is also close in the plane of the sky to hr  4796a .",
    "the proper motion of twa  25 is ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , thus from the ratio of total proper motion to hr  4796a ( 1.400:1.000 ) , one derives a distance to twa  25 of @xmath67pc .",
    "this is in good agreement with the photometric distance of 44pc given in @xcite . in this case",
    "( unlike 2m1207 ) , because twa  25 is an m0 dwarf and there are many similar spectral type members in the twa , the photometric distance should be fairly reliable .",
    "thus , the agreement between the proper motion and photometrically derived distances for twa  25 , supports the proper motion method we use to derive the distance to 2m1207 .",
    "based on the moving cluster method , @xcite estimated a somewhat smaller distance ( @xmath68pc ) to 2m1207 .",
    "because the moving cluster method to the twa is grounded in good hipparcos measured distances to only three stars ( tw  hya , hd  98800 , and hr  4796a ; the hipparcos distance to twa  9 appears to be wrong ) , conclusions drawn in the study of @xcite should be regarded with care .",
    "for example , that study rejects twa membership for the nearby ( @xmath69pc ) mid - m dwarf twa  22 @xcite because doing so substantially improves the vertex solution presented .",
    "yet twa  22 has a very strong lithium line @xcite and our survey of nearby , active , m - type stars over most of the sky ( song , bessell , & zuckerman , in preparation ) has revealed strong lithium lines only in the direction of the twa with the exception of a very few m - type members of the @xmath70  pic moving group .",
    "however , as the @xmath70  pic moving group has nearly the same galactic space motion as the twa ( table  7 , @xcite ) , even in the very unlikely event that twa  22 is a @xmath70  pic member , this could hardly impact the vertex solution .",
    "in addition , twa  22 turns out to be a @xmath71 binary with @xmath72mag ( chauvin et  al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "pushing its photometric distance from 22pc to 28pc .",
    "therefore , twa  22 is very likely a true twa member .",
    "because of such issues , we adopt our @xmath3pc distance determination for 2m1207 , in preference to earlier estimations .",
    "calculations of opacity - limited fragmentation in a turbulent 3-d medium yield minimum masses @xmath73  ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in these calculations and in evolutionary models of young , planetary - mass objects , our @xmath22  estimate for 2m1207b is likely not in conflict with the 7  fragmentation mass .",
    "alternatively , perhaps a different model , for example 2-d fragmentation of a shock compressed layer @xcite , will ultimately be needed to account for the properties of 2m1207b .",
    "the common proper motion confirmation of the first imaged planetary mass companion to a celestial object other than our sun enables the onset of a new era in extra - solar planet characterization  direct spectroscopic analysis .",
    "absorption spectroscopy of stellar light reprocessed through atmospheres of planets detected through radial velocity surveys has been demonstrated ( e.g. , hd  209458b ; @xcite ) .",
    "2m1207b provides the first opportunity to collect and spectroscopically analyze photons from an extra - solar planetary mass companion . exploiting the superb stability of the hst , we will attempt to obtain a near - ir grism spectrum of 2m1207b . relative to clear atmospheric models , dusty models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) predict more flux suppression in the @xmath74 m range , which can be readily compared to the anticipated s / n@xmath7510 grism spectrum .                                                                   radius circle ) and its companion ( @xmath76 to the se ) at 0.9 , 1.1 , and 1.6@xmath0 m ( left to right ) . by subtracting a second image of 2m1207 at a different celestial orientation , background light from the primary at the location of 2m1207b",
    "is effectively eliminated .",
