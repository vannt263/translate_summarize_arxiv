    "supersymmetry is an elegant solution of hierarchy problem of standard model ( sm ) @xcite , however , a simple supersymmetric extension of sm suffers from non - conservation of baryon number and @xmath9-problem .",
    "therefore we must introduce new symmetry such as r - parity in mssm , to suppress proton decay operators and @xmath9-term .",
    "one of the solutions of @xmath9-problem is given by introducing extra @xmath10 gauge symmetry @xcite . in this frame work , several new superfields such as singlet @xmath11 , exotic quarks @xmath12 , must be introduced to cancel gauge anomaly .",
    "this is the elegant solution of @xmath9-problem , however proton instability is not solved because the baryon number violating interactions in superpotential of mssm are replaced by single exotic quark interactions .    in the superpotential",
    ", there is no obvious distinction between baryon number violating trilinear terms and yukawa interactions .",
    "therefore it is natural to introduce flavor symmetry in suppressing baryon number violating operators .",
    "especially non - abelian discrete symmetry is good candidate for the flavor symmetry , because large mixing angles of maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) mixing matrix may be explained simultaneously , and more simply , non - abelian symmetry can be the reason why generation exists . at previous work , we explained @xmath13 flavor symmetry not only realizes maximal mixing angle @xmath14 but also suppresses proton decay based on @xmath15 gauge symmetry @xcite . as the suppression mechanism of proton decay is complicated and model dependent , in this paper , we give more detailed estimation of proton life time and investigate several flavon sectors .",
    "if we start from exactly flavor symmetric theory , the spontaneous flavor symmetry breaking realizes special vev direction of flavons , which affects proton life time significantly .",
    "if the yukawa hierarchy is realized by froggatt - nielsen mechanism , as @xmath16 are suppressed due to the small coupling constants , @xmath17 may dominate proton decay width . in our model , as @xmath17 are suppressed by cancellation , @xmath3 dominates the proton decay width .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we estimate proton life time based on gauge non - singlet flavon model . in section 3 , we modify the flavon sector by adding gauge - singlet flavon and froggatt - nielsen flavon . in section 4 ,",
    "we eliminate gauge non - singlet flavon and construct dirac neutrino model .",
    "finally we give conclusion of our analysis in section 5 .",
    "at first we explain the basic structure of our model .",
    "we extend the gauge symmetry to @xmath18 which is the subgroup of @xmath0 . in order to cancel gauge anomaly",
    ", we must add new superfields , such as sm singlet @xmath11 , exotic quark @xmath12 ( hereafter we call them g - quark ) and right handed neutrino ( rhn ) @xmath19 .",
    "we can embed these superfields with mssm superfields @xmath20 into @xmath21 of @xmath0 @xcite . as the singlet @xmath11 develops vev and breaks @xmath22 gauge symmetry , @xmath23 ( tev ) scale @xmath9-term",
    "is induced naturally . in order to break @xmath24 and generate a large majorana mass of rhn , we add sm singlet @xmath25 .",
    "the gauge representations of superfields are given in table 1 @xcite .",
    ".@xmath26 assignment of fields . where the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are charges of @xmath22 , @xmath30 and @xmath24 , and @xmath31 is hypercharge .",
    "r - parity @xmath32 $ ] is unbroken . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the quark and charged lepton yukawa interactions are not modified , we consider only yukawa interaction of neutrino which is given by substituting the vevs given in eq.(74 ) , eq.(76 ) and eq.(77 ) for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we get the effective superpotential as follow from which dirac neutrino mass matrix is given by where we can define @xmath35 and @xmath36 as real and non - negative and @xmath37 as complex without loss of generality . in the vev direction @xmath38 ,",
    "two large angles of charged lepton and neutrino mixing matrix are canceled and make it difficult to realize two large mixing angles of mns matrix",
    ". therefore we select the condition eq.(17 ) and put @xmath39 and @xmath40 by hand ( note that @xmath41 depends on @xmath42 only through @xmath43 . to realize maximal mixing of @xmath14 , we tune @xmath44 . ) , then the charged lepton mass matrix is given by from which we get to realize experimental results , the conditions given as follows must be satisfied .",
    "eq.(110 ) is rewritten as follow where @xmath45 terms are neglected . from this equation , we get the small discrepancies between eq.(103 ) and eq.(115 ) are recovered by multiplying o(1 ) coefficients @xmath46 .    by the modification of @xmath47 charge of @xmath48 ,",
    "the proton decay width is dominated by @xmath3 given in eq.(91 ) because suppression factor is reduced from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . from the experimental bound ,",
    "we get note that @xmath51 is suppressed by @xmath52 .",
    "we have considered proton stability based on @xmath1 symmetric extra u(1 ) models . without froggatt - nieslen mechanism , most stringent bound for proton decay channel",
    "is given by @xmath53 .",
    "as the single quark interaction is doubly suppressed by the vev of gauge non - singlet flavon , g - quark life time become very long .",
    "therefore the allowed region for flavon vev is very narrow for tev scale g - quark .    introducing froggatt - nielsen mechanism ,",
    "as we can weaken the @xmath1 flavon vev suppression , g - quark life time becomes short enough . from the naive power counting",
    ", we can expect @xmath54 would dominate the proton decay width , however , corresponding operator vanishes by cancellation and do not contribute to proton decay .",
    "therefore our model predicts @xmath3 dominates the proton decay width .",
    "this conclusion is not modified in dirac neutrino model .",
    "the condition given in eq.(34 ) gives four conditions as follows these conditions gives seven equations for eleven unknown real variables @xmath55 .",
    "as there are three experimantal conditions for @xmath56 , therefore we must impose one external condition to fix all unknowns . in this paper , we choose this external condition by hand as follow for simplicity . in this case",
