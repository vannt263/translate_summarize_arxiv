    "the subject of this paper is the attractor or attractors of an iterated function system ( ifs ) on a compact metric space .",
    "iterated function systems are used for the construction of deterministic fractals @xcite and have found numerous applications , in particular to image compression and image processing @xcite .",
    "the notion of an attactor of an ifs has historically been linked with the the contractive properties of the functions in the ifs , beginning with the work of huchinson @xcite . if the functions in the ifs are contractions , then the existence of an attractor , in a strong sense which we call a _ strict attractor _ , is assured .",
    "moreover , it has recently been shown @xcite that , for affine and mbius ifss ( defined in section  [ sec : attractor ] ) , the existence of an attractor implies that the functions in the ifs must be contractions .",
    "there do exists , however , examples of ifs attractors for which the functions are not contractions with respect to any metric that gives the same topology as the underlying space @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we investigate the topological and metric properties of attractors of a general ifs on a compact metric space for which the functions are not necessarily contractive .",
    "we rely on ideas in @xcite and @xcite , but restricted to what is , in many ways , a simpler setting .",
    "there are numerous definitions of an attractor ; see @xcite and @xcite for example .",
    "the notion of attractor as used in the paragraph above is the one that has become standard in the fractal geometry literature . for this paper",
    "the term _ strict attractor _ is used for this type of attractor , because it is natural in our setting to introduce a more general notion of attractor . for this type of attractor the term _ conley attractor _",
    "is used because it is essentially an extension to a finite set of functions of a notion used so successfully by conley for a single function @xcite .",
    "both the strict attractor and the conley attractor are defined in section  [ sec : attractor ] .",
    "the attractor block , an essential tool for our investigation of conley attractors , is the subject of section  [ sec : block ] , the main result being theorem  [ thm : block ] stating that every conley attractor possesses an attroctor block .",
    "section  [ sec : sc ] gives a couple of sufficient conditions that guarantee that a conley attractor is a strict attractor .",
    "these sufficient conditions involve both contractive properties of the functions in the ifs and the existence of a natural addressing function for the points of the attractor .",
    "the notion of  fibering \" plays a role ; the thesis of kieninger @xcite has an extensive discussion of the subject of fibering .    in the case that the functions in the ifs @xmath0 are invertible",
    ", there is a duality between the action of the ifs @xmath1 and the ifs @xmath2 consisting of the inverses of the maps in @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the notion of an attractor - repller pair @xmath3 consisting of a conley attractor @xmath4 of @xmath1 and a disjoint conley attractor @xmath5 of @xmath2 , the main result being theorem  [ thm : arpair ] in section  [ sec : ar ] . for the dynamics of a single function",
    ", this plays a significant role in conley s index theory @xcite and has been extended to the context of closed relations \" by mcgehee and wiandt @xcite . in general , an invertible ifs can have many conley attractor - repeller pairs .",
    "the second main result in section  [ sec : ar ] is theorem  [ cmwthm ] , which relates the structure of these conley attractor - repeller pairs to the dynamics of the ifs @xmath6 , more specifically to the set of chain - recurrent points of @xmath6 .",
    "the last section provides some examples of the properties described in the paper .",
    "unless otherwise stated , throughout this section @xmath7 is a complete metric space .",
    "the closure of a set @xmath8 is denoted @xmath9 and the interior by @xmath10 .",

    "if each of the maps @xmath14 is a homeomorphism then @xmath0 is said to be * invertible * , and the notation @xmath15 is used .    subsequently in this paper we refer to some special cases of an ifs . for an * affine ifs * we have @xmath16 and the functions in the ifs are affine functions of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath4 is an @xmath18 matrix and @xmath19 . for a * projective ifs * we have @xmath20 , real projective space , and the functions in the ifs are projective functions of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath4 is an @xmath22 matrix and @xmath23",
