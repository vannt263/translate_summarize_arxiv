    "recent years have seen much progress in our understanding of the physical laws governing negative energy densities associated with quantum fields .",
    "it has been known for some time that quantum field theory allows violations of all the classical pointwise energy conditions . in particular , quantum fields violate both the weak energy condition ( wec ) , which requires the stress - energy tensor @xmath0 to obey @xmath1 for all timelike vectors @xmath2 , and the null energy condition ( nec ) , which requires @xmath3 for all null vectors @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "examples are squeezed vacuum states of light @xcite and the casimir effect @xcite , both of which can be realized in the laboratory .",
    "it is also known that negative energy is required for the hawking evaporation of black holes @xcite , in which an outgoing flux of positive energy seen at infinity is paid for by a negative energy flux through the horizon @xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", it is worth considering weaker variants of the wec and nec , based on averages along timelike and null geodesics , respectively .",
    "two such conditions are the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the tangent vector to an inextendible timelike geodesic parametrized by proper time @xmath7 , and the averaged null energy condition ( anec ) : @xmath8 where @xmath4 is the tangent vector to an inextendible null geodesic and @xmath9 is an affine parameter . violation of the anec is known to be a necessary condition for the maintenance of traversable wormholes @xcite .",
    "the fact that quantum field theory allows the existence of states violating the classical energy conditions raises various concerns .",
    "if arbitrarily large negative energy densities could persist for arbitrarily long times , gross macroscopic effects might occur , including violations of the second law of thermodynamics or the formation of exotic spacetime structures .",
    "the latter includes `` designer spacetimes '' such as traversable wormholes @xcite , warp drives @xcite , and time machines @xcite . in two seminal papers , ford @xcite introduced the notion of what have come to be called `` quantum inequalities '' ( qis ) @xcite , which are restrictions derived from quantum field theory on the magnitude and duration of negative energy .",
    "more specifically , ford s original papers were primarily concerned with negative energy fluxes .",
    "his work was subsequently extended and generalized by himself and others to constraints on negative energy densities ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : qis ] and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews and more extensive references ) .    in this paper we will apply qis to place constraints on a class of wormholes introduced morris and thorne  @xcite and to some particular instances recently advanced by visser , kar , and dadhich ( vkd )  @xcite and kuhfittig  @xcite . in so doing",
    ", we will make some improvements to the arguments originally set out in ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain traversable wormhole geometries .",
    "the vkd and kuhfittig models we study are of interest because they are claimed to use ` arbitrarily small ' quantities of exotic matter .",
    "in particular , vkd propose a `` volume integral quantifier '' which they suggest is a good measure for the amount of exotic matter required to maintain a traversable wormhole .",
    "using this measure , they have shown that the amount of exotic matter can be made arbitrarily small , even though the anec integral along radial null geodesics passing through the wormhole is shown to be finite and negative .",
    "kuhfittig has also proposed several wormhole models @xcite with similar properties , the last of which he claims to be macroscopic and traversable , to require arbitrarily small amounts of exotic matter , and to be consistent with the qi bounds .    if one assumes that the exotic matter required to maintain these wormholes comes from quantum matter fields",
    ", then we show , using techniques related to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the geometry of these wormholes is severely constrained .",
    "however , our analysis differs from that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in that we introduce an alternative method for obtaining constraints on wormhole geometries , using a recently derived qi bound on the _ null_-contracted stress - energy averaged over a _ timelike _",
    "the bound allows us to perform a simplified analysis of general wormhole models , not just those with small quantities of exotic matter .",
    "we then use it to study , in particular , the models of visser , kar , and dadhich , and the models of kuhfittig .",
    "the vkd wormholes are constrained by the qi bound to be either submicroscopic in size ( e.g. , a few orders of magnitude above the planck length ) , or to have a very small ratio of minimum curvature radius to throat size .",
    "an examination of kuhfittig s models shows that a confusion between proper and coordinate distances in fact renders the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite _ non_-traversable .",
    "in particular , we explicitly show that radially infalling light rays and particles reach the throat of this wormhole only after an infinite lapse of affine parameter .",
    "lastly , we provide a further justification for our bound using a `` difference inequality '' argument .",
    "we begin with a short review of quantum inequalities , both to explain their nature and to set out the extent of the known results and the classes of states for which they hold .    to start , consider @xmath10-dimensional minkowski space , and let @xmath11 be the worldline of an inertial observer with proper time parameter @xmath7 and velocity @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a smooth nonnegative function peaked around @xmath14 , with unit characteristic width  @xcite and normalized so that @xmath15 , then the integrals @xmath16 are local averages of the expected renormalized energy density seen over a timescale @xmath17 about @xmath14 when the field is in state @xmath18 . by decreasing @xmath17 , we can ` zoom in ' on the region around @xmath14 ; we may use the freedom to move the zero of proper time along @xmath19 to zoom in on different regions of the worldline .",
    "quantum inequalities are constraints on these local averages",
    ". an example would be a statement of the form : _ there exists a dimensionless positive constant @xmath20 ( depending on @xmath21 and @xmath10 , but not @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) such that @xmath22 for all physically reasonable states @xmath18 and all sampling times @xmath23_. ( here , as elsewhere , we employ units with @xmath24 . ) a variety of such bounds have been established in varying levels of generality and rigor and with varying conditions on the sampling functions and the class of states involved .",
    "the original qis ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , were established for the lorentzian sampling function @xmath25 , and provided the constant @xmath26 if @xmath27 .",
    "a subsequent generalization  @xcite permitted all @xmath21 of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is smooth , real - valued and of compact support [ i.e. , vanishing outside a compact set ] or of sufficiently rapid decay at infinity . in this case , for @xmath27 , @xmath30 which has a minimum value of around @xmath31  @xcite if @xmath29 is supported in an interval of unit length .",
    "note that it is crucial that @xmath29 be smooth enough to have a square integrable second derivative  @xcite .",
    "the arguments so far mentioned , i.e. , those of refs .",
    "@xcite , utilize formal manipulations in fock space and so are limited  in the first instance  to a class of states arising as vectors in ( or density matrices on ) the fock space built on the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "these limitations were removed by the first fully rigorous bound applicable in general dimension @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this bound applies to a general smooth timelike curve @xmath11 in a general globally hyperbolic spacetime and asserts : _ given any hadamard state @xmath33 as a ` reference state ' , the bound @xmath34 g(\\tau)^2\\,d\\tau \\ge -{\\mathcal{q}}[g ] \\label{eq : agwqi}\\ ] ] holds for all hadamard states @xmath18 and smooth , real - valued , compactly supported @xmath29 , where @xmath35 $ ] is a quadratic form depending on the spacetime , the trajectory @xmath19 , a choice of @xmath10-bein near @xmath19 , and the reference state @xmath33 . _",
    "it must be emphasized that @xmath36 $ ] is finite for all @xmath29 in our class , that there is a closed - form expression for @xmath36 $ ] in terms of the two - point function of @xmath33 and , most importantly , that @xmath18 and @xmath33 are _ arbitrary _ hadamard states : there is no assumption that @xmath18 can be represented as a vector or density matrix in the same hilbert space representation as @xmath33 [ i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath33 may belong to different ` folia ' ] .",
    "this is because the argument used in  @xcite is formulated within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes , and does not require the theory to be formulated in hilbert space .",
    "the qi , eq .",
    "( [ eq : agwqi ] ) , is an example of a `` difference qi '' ; that is , it bounds the difference of the expectation values of the energy density in an arbitrary quantum state and in some reference state .",
    "however , eq.([eq : agwqi ] ) is easily converted into an `` absolute qi '' @xmath37 \\label{eq : agwqi'}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 = { \\mathcal{q}}[g]-\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\langle t_{ab}u^au^b\\rangle_{\\omega_0}(\\xi(\\tau ) ) g(\\tau)^2\\,d\\tau\\ ] ] is also finite for all @xmath29 in our class , because the integrand on the right - hand side is smooth and compactly supported .",
    "again , it must be emphasized that ",
    "contrary to the mistaken view recently expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite  this bound holds for _ any _ hadamard state @xmath18 , not simply those in the folium of @xmath33 .",
    "if we apply the above bounds to the case of an inertial worldline in four - dimensional minkowski space , with @xmath33 chosen to be the minkowski vacuum state then a bound of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : qiform ] ) is obtained if we put @xmath28 and with @xmath20 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) .",
    "let us note a separate strand of work  @xcite , initiated by flanagan , which treats massless fields in two - dimensional curved spacetimes for general worldlines and arbitrary hadamard states .",
    "there are also various extensions of the qi bounds to free dirac @xcite , maxwell @xcite , proca @xcite and rarita ",
    "schwinger @xcite fields .",
    "in addition , it has recently been proved ( by extending the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that all unitary , positive energy conformal field theories in two - dimensional minkowski space obey qi bounds @xcite , thus providing the first examples of qis for interacting quantum field theories .",
    "no general results are known for other interacting quantum field theories , although olum and graham have provided an example in four - dimensions with two coupled scalar fields in which a static negative energy density is created .",
    "this suggests that worldline quantum inequalities might not hold for general interacting quantum field theories without some further qualification .",
    "however , several important caveats must be entered : first , the olum ",
    "graham example does not exclude the possibility that qis might hold for local averages over suitable spacetime volumes .",
    "we expect that this is indeed the case  as it is for conformal fields  @xcite  and moreover that this would not substantially modify the results of our analysis in any significant way .",
    "second , the olum ",
    "graham example is effectively hard - wired into the lagrangian , which has been engineered to produce a domain wall configuration of the required type .",
    "it is not clear to us that a _ single _ choice of lagrangian ( including specific values for any parameters it contains ) could produce _ arbitrarily _ negative static energy densities .",
    "if not , then one might well be able to apply worldline quantum inequalities on scales shorter than the length scales [ implicit in the lagrangian ] which fix the magnitude of any static negative energy density configurations .",
    "however definite statements on these issues must await more progress on interacting theories .",
    "quantum inequalities have been used to place constraints on several different `` designer spacetimes '' , such as traversable wormhole and warp drive spacetimes @xcite . in each case , the basic idea is to obtain the stress - energy tensor required to support a given spacetime and then test it for consistency with the qi bounds , leading to constraints on various parameters arising in the metric .",
    "a problem which must be confronted is that the qi , eq .",
    "( [ eq : agwqi ] ) , requires explicit knowledge of the two - point function of a reference state @xmath33 to compute the right - hand side .",
    "such knowledge is not at hand for general wormhole models and hinders attempts to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : agwqi ] ) directly . instead",
    ", we will follow ref .",
    "@xcite in assuming that the _ flat spacetime _",
    "qi bounds should also be applicable in curved spacetimes and/or spacetimes with boundaries , in the `` short sampling time limit . ''",
    "specifically , we restrict the sampling time to be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the smallest proper radius of curvature or the smallest proper distance to any boundary of the spacetime , and apply qi bounds for averaging along timelike _ geodesics _  @xcite .    strictly speaking , this is an _ assumption _ , but it is one for which good justification can be provided .",
    "three arguments may be given ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : firstly , the equivalence principle leads us to expect that physics `` in the small '' should be approximately minkowskian as far as freely falling observers are concerned ; secondly , it is borne out by specific examples in four dimensions by taking the short - sampling time limit of various curved spacetime qis @xcite ; thirdly , one of us ( cjf ) has recently established the validity of this assumption for massless scalar fields in general two - dimensional spacetimes @xcite .",
    "further support is provided by a new argument sketched in sec .",
    "[ sec : da ] .",
    "it is also expected that a more general proof may be given , and work is in progress on this question .",
    "the use of flat spacetime qis in the above fashion suffices to put fairly strong constraints on `` designer spacetimes '' , such as traversable wormhole and warp drive spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these analyses were based on qis using lorentzian sampling functions , but the more recent qis based on compactly supported sampling functions remove worries that the infinite `` tails '' of a non - compactly supported sampling function might invalidate the analysis by picking up large non - local effects .",
    "( this could also be dealt with by making the width of the sampling function small enough to make the sampling function drop off sufficiently fast , at the expense of weakening the qi bounds . )",
    "we study a class of four - dimensional traversable wormholes introduced by morris and thorne @xcite in which two spacetime regions , referred to as the `` upper universe '' and the `` lower universe '' are joined by a throat .",
    "the wormhole models are static , spherically symmetric , and , for simplicity , the upper and lower universes are taken to be isometric .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 measures the signed proper radial distance from the wormhole throat , running from @xmath43 in the asymptotic region of the lower universe to @xmath44 in the asymptotic region of the upper universe , with @xmath45 at the wormhole throat itself .",
    "the general form of the wormhole metric is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the proper circumference of a circle of fixed @xmath42 in the equatorial plane @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 constant ) , and @xmath50 is called the `` red - shift function '' .",
    "the function @xmath51 is assumed to be even , twice continuously differentiable , and to possess a global minimum at the throat , where @xmath52 , and no other stationary points .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath53 for all @xmath54 , which ensures that the wormhole `` flares out '' when seen in an embedding diagram , such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : whprofile ] .",
    "we also require that @xmath55 as @xmath56 , fast enough to ensure asymptotic flatness .",
    "the red - shift function @xmath57 is defined on @xmath58 .",
    "we require @xmath59 to be twice continuously differentiable and to satisfy @xmath60 as @xmath56 fast enough to ensure asymptotic flatness .",
    "although symmetry between the upper and lower universes requires @xmath61 we note that @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ i.e. , the derivatives with respect to @xmath64 may be divergent as @xmath65 , a point which we will discuss later .",
    "for the wormhole to be traversable it must have no horizons , which implies that @xmath66 must never be allowed to vanish , and hence @xmath57 must be everywhere bounded from below ; it must also be bounded from above by virtue of continuity and its behavior as @xmath67 .",
    "the restrictions that @xmath59 and @xmath51 be twice continuously differentiable ensure that the stress - energy tensor ( obtained from einstein s equations ) is continuous .",
    "it is sometimes useful to weaken this condition at isolated values of @xmath42 so as to allow the inclusion of thin shells of matter .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce a radial coordinate @xmath68 , with range @xmath58 , on the upper universe ( or , equally , on the lower universe ) so that the metric now takes the form @xmath69 here , @xmath70 , defined on @xmath58 , is called the `` shape function '' and is related to the function @xmath51 by @xmath71 or , equivalently , @xmath72 for @xmath54 .",

    "hence even light rays can not traverse the wormhole .",
    "a common problem in all the kuhfittig models is the confusion of coordinate distances and proper distances , as for example , in his estimates of traversability times . for a slowly flaring wormhole ,",
    "a small difference in coordinate length can correspond to an enormous difference in proper length ( see figures  [ fig : whprofile ] and  [ fig : whprofile_flared ] ) . as a result , although such a wormhole might have its exotic matter concentrated in a small coordinate thickness in radius , the proper volume of the region of exotic matter could in fact be very large .",
    "at the end of sec .  [",
    "sec : nullqi ] , we argued that the minkowski space bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : const_bd ] ) could be adapted to curved spacetimes under certain hypotheses . in the static case",
    ", we noted that a necessary condition for the validity of this approach is that the bound is satisfied for the expected stress - energy tensor of the static ground state ( assuming this is hadamard ) , with @xmath17 of the order of the minimum length scale characterizing the geometry .",
    "here , we show that this is also a sufficient condition ; this may also be regarded as providing a second argument in favor of a bound of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) . instead of applying the minkowski bound on sufficiently small scales ,",
    "we may consider what sort of qi could be derived directly in the wormhole spacetime . in fact",
    "our analysis applies to any static globally hyperbolic spacetime , provided the quantum field theory does not have bad infra - red behaviour .",

    "@xcite we obtain a bound @xmath363 for any hadamard state @xmath18 of the scalar field , where the hat denotes fourier transform  @xcite . as before @xmath29 is smooth , real - valued and compactly supported in @xmath116 . _",
    "the advantage here is that we now no longer need to restrict the support of @xmath29 to be small in relation to curvature scales .",
    "_ by arguments parallel to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , the function @xmath364 is non - negative , continuous from the left , increasing , and growing no faster than polynomially at infinity .",
    "in fact , if the two - point function of the ground state is given by a sum ( or integral ) of mode functions @xmath365 ( note that the @xmath366 will be nonnegative if @xmath33 is a ground state ) then @xmath367 where @xmath368 and @xmath369 ( see , e.g. , the introduction to ref .",
    "this result could also be obtained using the less rigorous methods of ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "suppose that the static spacetime geometry is supported by a particular hadamard state @xmath18",
    ". then @xmath370 must be constant on the static trajectory @xmath19 , as must the vacuum energy @xmath371 because @xmath33 was assumed to be static .",

    "it is convenient to rewrite the denominator in the last expression in terms of the fourier transform , using parseval s theorem .",
    "moreover , @xmath374 is even in @xmath375 because @xmath29 is real - valued , which permits us to write @xmath376 we may now try to maximize the expression on the right - hand side over the class of @xmath29 at our disposal . fix any compactly supported real - valued @xmath29 for which the denominator above is unity , and then replace @xmath29 by @xmath377 , and therefore @xmath378 by @xmath379 . as the sampling time is increased by increasing @xmath9 , @xmath379 becomes more sharply peaked near @xmath380 ( @xmath378 decays rapidly at infinity because @xmath29 is smooth and compactly supported ) .",
    "taking the limit @xmath381 ( cf .",
    "an argument in the proof of theorem 4.7 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) we obtain @xmath382 where @xmath383 .",
    "now @xmath384 will vanish unless the quantum field theory has bad infra - red behaviour , e.g. , a square - integrable zero mode . excluding such pathological cases",
    ", we have @xmath385 thus the ground state yields the lowest constant value of @xmath386 possible ( amongst hadamard states ) along a static trajectory . accordingly ,",
    "if the ground state obeys a bound of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : const_bd ] ) with @xmath17 of the order of the minimum length scale characterizing the geometry , then the bound will hold for all hadamard states capable of supporting a static geometry .",

    "( [ eq : dabd ] ) has the dimensions of @xmath387 , and can be written as @xmath388 , where @xmath41 is the minimal length scale associated with the geometry .",
    "we know that the wormhole models violate the nec at [ or arbitrarily close to ] the throat , so if @xmath389 the wormhole would be inconsistent with qis .",
    "so let us assume that @xmath390 . inserting the required stress - energy tensor , we now have a bound @xmath391 or @xmath392 which should be compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "since the dimensionless constant @xmath393 is typically of the order of @xmath394 , this new bound is stronger than that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) by five orders of magnitude .",
    "this supports our earlier argument and also suggests that the bounds given above are extremely conservative : the casimir energy would have to be ten orders of magnitude higher than our typical experience ( i.e. , @xmath395 ) in order for eq .",

    "we have analyzed the recent wormhole models of visser , kar , and dadhich , and of kuhfittig . in these models only arbitrarily small amounts of exotic matter are required to hold the wormholes open .",

    "the bound allows us to perform a simplified analysis of general wormhole models , not just those with small quantities of exotic matter .",
    "we showed that our bound implies that _ macroscopic _ wormholes of the visser - kar - dadhich type are ruled out or severely constrained .",
    "for the kuhfittig models , we show that a confusion between coordinate lengths and proper lengths in fact disqualifies the model in ref .",
    "@xcite from being traversable .",
    "it turns out that for this model , radially infalling particles and light rays reach the throat only after an infinite lapse of affine parameter , due to the extremely slow flaring of the wormhole throat .",
    "related constraints were also derived for two of kuhfittig s earlier models .",
    "one lesson to be drawn from our results is that simply concentrating the exotic matter , in a classical analysis , to an arbitrarily small region around the wormhole throat is , by itself , not sufficient to guarantee both traversability and consistency with ( or evasion of ) the quantum inequality bounds .",
