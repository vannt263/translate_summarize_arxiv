    "water vapor turbulence can limit the performance of high dynamic range interferometers that use phase - referenced modes , even though such turbulence is only a small contributor to the total seeing at visible and infrared wavelengths . indeed , because water vapor is highly dispersive , random fluctuations in its differential column density above each aperture ( or water vapor seeing ) will create a chromatic component to the optical path difference ( opd ) that is not properly tracked at wavelengths different from that of the fringe sensor .",
    "the impact of this effect on infrared interferometry has been addressed extensively in the literature , either in a general context@xcite or applied to specific instruments that include phase - referenced modes using k - band light such as vlti / midi@xcite , vlti / genie@xcite , or the keck interferometer nuller@xcite ( kin ) . in this paper",
    ", we address the effect of precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) in the context of the large binocular telescope interferometer@xcite ( lbti ) , which uses a k - band fringe sensor to provide high - bandwidth path length compensation for all its scientific channels ( 1.5 - 13@xmath0 m ) and in particular for the nulling interferometer that operates at 11@xmath0 m .",
    "because both apertures are installed on a single steerable mount , each beam travels almost exactly the same path length in both the atmosphere and the lbti cryostat .",
    "therefore , the deterministic dispersion due to the differential path length in humid air , which impacts most long - baseline interferometers , can be ignored in the case of the lbt and we will focus the following analysis on random atmospheric dispersion due to water vapor seeing ( which is the dominant contributor ) . according to previous studies@xcite , the random component due to water vapor density variations",
    "are expected to be about 10@xmath1 of the total water vapor in the air column , which is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the equivalent value for dry air density variations ( i.e. , less than 10@xmath2 of the total air column ) .",
    "dry air still dominates the refractivity and seeing because it is the dominant volume contributor but atmospheric water vapor is much more dispersive , with a ratio of water vapor to dry air dispersion of 200:1 at k band@xcite .",
    "therefore , variable differential water - vapor column densities above each aperture will create random and wavelength - dependent opd variations ( on longer timescales than dry air , typically a few seconds to a few minutes ) .",
    "measurements with the kin have shown that this effect produces an opd rms error of 0.32@xmath0 m at n band when tracking the fringes at k band in median conditions at mauna kea@xcite ( a factor 2.3 smaller than theoretical predictions ) .",
    "for the lbti , we expect a similar value due to the combination of two opposing effects : the wetter median conditions at mount graham and the shorter baseline ( 14.4 m vs 82 m ) , which sees more correlated piston turbulence and hence less opd variations ( depending on the outer scale of the water vapor turbulence ) .",
    "differential tip - tilt and phase variations between the two ao - corrected apertures are measured with phasecam@xcite , lbti s near - infrared camera .",
    "phasecam uses a fast - readout picnic detector that receives the near - infrared light from both interferometric outputs ( see left panel of figure  [ fig : combination ] ) .",
    "various sensing approaches are implemented and the default mode consists in forming a k - band image of pupil fringes ( equivalent to wedge fringes ) on the detector and measure both the phase and the differential tip / tilt simultaneously via fourier transform ( see figure  [ fig : approach ] ) .",
    "because of the nature of the fourier transform measurement , the phase measurement is limited to phase values in the [ @xmath3,@xmath4 range so that any phase error larger than @xmath5 is not detected and , hence , not corrected .",
    "on - sky verification showed that such phase jumps occur occasionally even with the phase loop closed at 1khz . in order to get around this issue , the envelope of interference ( or the group delay )",
    "is tracked simultaneously via the change in contrast of the fringes ( i.e. , contrast gradient or cg@xcite ) .",
    "this measurement is done at slower speed , typically 1hz , and is used to detect and correct any phase jumps not captured by the fourier transform phase measurement . actually , this slow drift between group delay and phase delay is exactly the effect expected from water vapor turbulence .",
    "in addition to the real - time control described above , opd and individual tip / tilt motions induced by the telescope structure are fedforward to a fast pathlength corrector ( fpc ) using real - time data from 30 active accelerometers all over the telescope ( optical vibration monitoring system , ovms@xcite ) .",
    "a new software system , called ovms@xmath6 , was recently tested and provided significant improvements in the loop stability and performance@xcite .",
    "peaking filters are also used to improve the rejection of specific vibration frequencies not captured by the feedfoward system .",
    "they are biquad filters applied directly to the control algorithm that drives the fpc .",
    "commissioning observations have shown that the loop can run at full speed down to a magnitude of k@xmath76.5 , which is sufficient to observe all targets of the lbti exozodiacal dust survey ( hunt for observable signatures of terrestrial planetary systems , hosts@xcite ) .",
    "the loop frequency can in principle be decreased down to @xmath730hz to observe fainter objects but this has never been tested and requires more investigation .",

    ", we have added new filters to the phasecam optics in order to use a two color sensing approach .",
    "the measurement approach is then similar to that used for the kin , the only difference being that we use the phase measured in two broadband channels ( h and k ) rather than the curvature of the phase within the k band .",
    "one output of the interferometer ( see left part of figure  [ fig : combination ] ) is now obtained at h band , while the main output remains at k band .",
    "the idea is to measure deviations from achromatic opd variations using simultaneous h- and k - band unwrapped phase measurements . to be specific , the first step of the algorithm is to measure the difference in phase at h and k band ( or the group delay ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are obtained separately from each output of the interferometer .",
    "then , we construct a ",
    "pseudo - k \" phase term from the group delay as : @xmath11 which can understood as the k - band phase calculated from the h - band phase under achromatic assumption .",
    "finally , we compute the so - called `` water term '' as the difference between the two phase values : @xmath12 this water term is used to estimate the differential water vapor columns above each aperture and predict phase variations at other wavelengths ( see section  [ sec : pwv_opd ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : opd_perfo ] ( left ) shows the closed - loop power spectral density ( psd ) of the opd variations obtained in april 2016 under typical observing conditions .",
    "as expected , the low - frequency ( @xmath1320 - 30hz ) component of the seeing is strongly removed and the opd residuals are dominated by high - frequency perturbations due to resonant optics inside the lbti cryostat .",
    "the closed - loop residual opd currently amounts to approximately 280 nm rms as shown by the right part of figure  [ fig : opd_perfo ] .",
    "this is approximately 150 nm better than previously - published results obtained one year ago@xcite .",
    "this improvement is mostly due to an improved real - time control loop , a better vibration environment , and the routine use of the ovms+ software@xcite for feedforward .",
    "figure  [ fig : wt ] shows an example of simultaneous h - band ( top left ) and k - band ( top right ) phase measurements obtained under wet conditions .",
    "the data have been obtained at 1khz and boxcar averaged in order to better show the low frequency fluctuations due to water vapor . as expected , the phase rms measured at h band ( 9 degrees or 41 nm ) is larger than that measured at k band ( 4.5 degrees or 28 nm ) due to variable atmospheric dispersion . combining the two terms using equation  [ eq : wt ] , we can form the water term represented in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : wt ] and predict the phase fluctuations in the bandpass of the nuller . using this predicted phase",
    ", we can construct the expected null variations from the water term .",
    "this is shown in the bottom right part of figure  [ fig : wt ] by the red line computed using a multiplicative gain on the water term of 6 and a constant phase offset of -240 degrees .",
    "simultaneous null measurements are over - plotted in blue and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach .",
    "the next step will consist in using this signal to adjust the null setpoint in real time and , therefore , mitigate the phase variations in the nuller bandpass .",
    "recent efforts in co - phasing the lbti were focused on two main areas : ( 1 ) improving the performance of the system at k band where the fringe sensor operates and ( 2 ) compensating for atmospheric dispersion with the implementation of a new sensing mode . thanks to an improved real - time control loop , a better vibration environment , and the routine use of opd feedforward , the lbti currently achieves a co - phasing stability of 280 nm rms at 1khz .",
    "this performance is currently limited by high - frequency phase fluctuations occurring inside the lbti cryostat and future work will focus on identifying and damping the source of these vibrations .",
    "regarding atmospheric dispersion , a new mode was implemented to measure the phase at h and k band simultaneously ( each using a different output of the interferometer ) . using the information provided by the two wavelengths , it is possible to predict the phase variations at n band where the lbti nuller operates .",
    "we have recently demonstrated the feasibility of this approach with simultaneous h- , k- , and n - band data .",
    "future work will focus on using this signal to adjust the null setpoint in real time and , therefore , mitigate the phase variations in the nuller bandpass .",
    "the authors are grateful to m.  colavita , o.  absil , a.  matter , and j.  meisner for helpful discussions on fringe sensing and water vapor opd measurements .",
