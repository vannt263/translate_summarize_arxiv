    "the detailed analysis of the short  timescale absorption variability in these sources strongly suggests the presence of absorbing structures ( clouds ) crossing the line  of  sight to a rather compact x  ray source .",
    "the data are generally consistent with the presence of an ensemble of compact , cold clouds with typical column density of @xmath13  @xmath3 , density of @xmath14  @xmath7 , velocity of few times @xmath15  km  s@xmath16 , and distance of @xmath17 from the centre .",
    "these properties are remarkably similar to those of the clouds responsible for the emission of the broad optical and uv emission lines in agn .",
    "hence , x  ray absorption variability studies suggest to identify the compact absorbers responsible for the shortest timescale absorption variability events with broad line region ( blr ) clouds , while variability on longer timescales ( months to years ) is likely associated with more extended structures , possibly associated with a clumpy torus ( nenkova et al .",

    "however , the 210  kev flux was a factor of @xmath30 higher than during the _ xmm  newton _ observation , which can easily explain the non  detection of the ionized fe lines as , for constant  intensity lines , their ew drops by a similar factor and becomes consistent with zero within the uncertainties .",
    "this likely signals that the ionized lines are associated with emission from extended photo ",
    "ionized gas , so that their flux remains constant and the lines can only be detected when the x  ray continuum flux is relatively low , as during the _ xmm  newton _ observation .",
    "the same applies to the narrow fe k@xmath18 line at 6.4  kev , as its ew during the _ suzaku _ observation ( @xmath40  ev ) is broadly consistent with being half of that measured here ( @xmath41  ev ) , which is what is expected for a line with a constant intensity and a continuum variation by a factor of @xmath30 . we point out that if the width of the fe k@xmath18 line is allowed to vary during the fit , we have @xmath42  kev , corresponding to a fwhm@xmath43  km  s@xmath16 ( consistent with any production site , from the innermost blr outwards ) . with the addition of these narrow emission lines , the final best  fitting model for the 0.910  kev spectrum produces a statistical result of @xmath44 for 3832 dof .",

    "the existence of a plateau with maximal cf smaller than 1 , as well as the steepness of the rising and decaying phases , point towards a physical situation characterised by a cloud , smaller than the source , crossing our line  of  sight .",
    "the other possible scenario , specifically a larger cloud misaligned with the source would imply a much smoother and slower growth and decrease of the cf , which is not taking place here .",
    "we then assume here the simplest possible geometry that can explain our data , namely the presence of an x  ray source of size ( diameter ) @xmath65 and of an obscuring cloud of size @xmath66 , see fig .",
    "the @xmath63 evolution identifies three different timescales : ( i ) the crossing time @xmath67  ks , i.e. the total time during which @xmath68 ; ( ii ) the transit time @xmath69  ks during which the source is maximally covered ( i.e. up to 5 intervals are consistent with being maximally covered ) ; ( iii ) the partially covered rising / decaying time @xmath70  ks needed to reach the maximal covering fraction starting from zero ( and viceversa ) . on the other hand all these timescales",

    "<S> we present results obtained from the time  resolved x  ray spectral analysis of the narrow  line  seyfert  1 galaxy swift  j2127.4 + 5654 during a @xmath0  ks _ xmm  newton _ observation . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal large spectral variations , especially during the first @xmath1  90  ks of the _ xmm  newton _ exposure . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral variability can be attributed to a partial eclipse of the x - ray source by an intervening low  ionization / cold absorbing structure ( cloud ) with column density @xmath2  @xmath3 which gradually covers and then uncovers the x  ray emitting region with covering fraction ranging from zero to @xmath4  per cent . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis enables us to constrain the size , number density , and location of the absorbing cloud with good accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we infer a cloud size ( diameter ) of @xmath5  cm , corresponding to a density of @xmath6  @xmath7 at a distance of @xmath8  cm from the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> all of the inferred quantities concur to identify the absorbing structure with one single cloud associated with the broad line region of swift  j2127.4 + 5654 . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to constrain the x  ray emitting region size ( diameter ) to be @xmath9  cm which , assuming the black hole mass estimated from single  epoch optical spectroscopy ( @xmath10 ) , translates into @xmath11 gravitational radii ( @xmath12 ) with larger sizes ( in @xmath12 ) being associated with smaller black hole masses , and viceversa . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm the presence of a relativistically distorted reflection component off the inner accretion disc giving rise to a broad relatvistic fe k emission line and small soft excess ( small because of the high galactic column density ) , supporting the measurement of an intermediate black hole spin in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 that was obtained from a previous _ suzaku _ observation .    </S>",
