    "spin properties of electrons in semiconductor heterostructures have become in recent years subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest because of their inherent scientific value as well as possible spintronic applications . among numerous heterostructures",
    ", the system gaas / ga@xmath3al@xmath4as has won a unique position .",
    "first , gaas is after silicon the most important semiconductor material .",
    "second , the system gaas / ga@xmath3al@xmath4as has well established parameters which allows the theorists to describe new subtle phenomena .",
    "third , due to the advanced growth technology the electrons in gaas quantum wells have very high mobilities making it possible to detect even weak effects .",
    "thus it is of interest to describe precisely the spin and orbital electron energies in gaas / ga@xmath3al@xmath4as quantum wells not only for their own sake , but also as a model example for other heterostructures . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "a description of magnetooptical effects in gaas - type materials is not an easy task since gaas is a medium gap semiconductor . as a result , its band structure exhibits features characteristic of narrow - gap materials , but it is insufficient to treat them by the models normally used for such systems .",
    "we showed in our previous work on bulk gaas and inp that the simplest adequate description of the band structure of these materials is given by the so called five - level * p@xmath0p *   model [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "thus , the present work on the spin @xmath1-factor of electrons in gaas / ga@xmath3al@xmath4as quantum wells was first motivated by the fact that the theoretical description used in the literature for this purpose had been based on the three - level model [ 3 ] .",
    "examining the problem we realized that the theory [ 3 ] suffers from other deficiencies , as we will demonstrate below .",
    "the theory we develop for the spin energies is equally valid for the cyclotron ( orbital ) energies , so that we describe also the cyclotron masses , although here our treatment improves only slightly the existing approach [ 4 ] .",
    "an important feature of the iii - v compounds is a bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) of these materials . as is known from the fifties [ 5 ] , the bia results in a spin splitting of energies for a given direction of the wavevector * k*. it is , however , of interest to investigate how this spin splitting behaves in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "one can rephrase the problem by asking how the zeeman spin splitting caused by the magnetic field combines with the spin splitting caused by bia . in the bulk magneto - optical or magneto - transport studies one is usually interested in the landau levels at @xmath9 = 0 , since the density of landau states has singularities at the vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "however , in a quantum well one deals with electric subbands for which the value of @xmath10 is `` frozen '' in the subband wavefunction along the growth direction .",
    "the bia splitting is sensitive to this @xmath10 value which increases with a decreasing well width .",
    "this in turn is reflected in the spin @xmath1-factor . in the following we",
    "will be concerned with symmetric quantum wells , so that the bychkov - rashba spin splitting , caused by the structure inversion asymmetry , does not come into play [ 6 ] .",
    "our calculation of the spin and cyclotron electron energies in gaas / ga@xmath3al@xmath4as heterostructures is based on the five - level * p@xmath0p *   model ( 5lm ) .",
    "an important advantage of the model is that it includes the bia mechanism of the spin splitting .",
    "we solve the eigenenergy problem by an iteration procedure which is more precise than an expansion in powers of momentum used in the literature .",
    "we check the precision of consecutive iteration steps .",
    "the results are compared with those obtained by the three - level * p@xmath0p *   model ( 3lm ) and it is shown that the latter is insufficient for the gaas - type materials .    our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the * p@xmath0p *   theory within 5lm is formulated for the bulk semiconductor . next",
    "the 3lm model is used to obtain results for the spin @xmath1-value .",
    "it is demonstrated that the procedure of ref . [ 3 ] based on the same model is inadequate .",
    "the iteration solution of 5lm is checked against `` exact '' results for the bulk , as obtained by a numerical procedure . in section",
    "iii the theory for the quantum wells is worked out from the 5lm matrix .",
    "results for the spin @xmath1-factor and the cyclotron mass are presented , compared with experimental data and discussed in section iv .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary .",
    "in order to discuss the previous treatments and to establish standards of precision for various approximations we first consider the 3d case .",

    "the resulting bands are spherical ( i.e. the energies do not depend on the direction of * b * ) , but the spin - up and spin - down states are mixed by the @xmath9 terms .",

    "an influence of free electron terms on the description of spin @xmath1-factors in selected materials was discussed by singh et al [ 10 ] .    in investigations of bulk semiconductors",
    "one is usually interested in the simplified case of @xmath9 = 0 since the singular density of states for the landau levels corresponds to the vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "however , our final aim in this work is to investigate quantum wells , which corresponds to the situation of @xmath59 0 .",
    "solving eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) for the spin - up and spin - down energies one can find the cyclotron effective mass and the spin @xmath1-value exactly within 3lm .",

    "( 9 ) of ref . [ 3 ] with the use of the same material parameters .",
    "it can be seen that ref . [ 3 ] predicts a much stronger dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath102 than both our curves and , in particular , our dashed curve which has been calculated in the same nonparabolic approximation as that used in ref . [ 3 ] .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is that the formulas given in ref .",
    "[ 3 ] correspond to our eq .",

    "( 19 ) . as a result , the second term in the square bracket of eq .",

    "this gives a much too strong dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath108 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 .    the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath101 ( or @xmath102 ) , as given by the exact solution of 3lm ( curve ex in fig .",
    "2 ) , does not describe experimental data in gaas / ga@xmath5al@xmath6as quantum wells . in particular , it does not exhibit the change of sign to positive @xmath1-factors for small values of @xmath101 . on the other hand , we know that the inclusion of higher conduction @xmath33 , @xmath34 bands in the * p@xmath0p *   description ( see fig .",
    "1 ) results in stronger conduction band s nonparabolicity and , in particular , it gives the electron @xmath1-values that change sign to positive at higher electron energies [ 1 ] .",
    "thus it is necessary to include the @xmath35 , @xmath36 levels in the refined description of @xmath1 in gaas .",
    "this is equivalent to using the full matrix ( 8) for the determination of electron energies . in view of the applications to quantum wells",
    "the @xmath9 terms must be retained .",
    "we pursue this program below .      in this section",
    "we calculate the spin @xmath1-value of conduction electrons using the five - level * p@xmath0p *   model .",
    "this model is adequate for the gaas - type materials .",
    "once the two upper conduction levels are included , the matrix elements @xmath64 , @xmath57 and @xmath109 come into play , see fig .",
    "1 . as a result , two qualitatively new features appear .",
    "first , the appearance of the matrix element @xmath57 makes the conduction band nonspherical .",
    "second , the matrix element @xmath57 does not vanish if the crystal is characterized by the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) .",
    "this results in the spin splitting of conduction energies for a given direction of the wave vector * k * ( the dresselhaus mechanism [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we develop a workable approach to the calculation of @xmath1-factor in quantum wells based of 5lm using an iterative expansion in powers of the interband matrix elements @xmath110 , @xmath64 and @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , it is necessary to check whether such an expansion is adequate . in other words",
    ", we should make sure that the expansion procedure gives the @xmath1-values comparable with those obtained from the complete matrix ( 8) . to this end we first solve the eigenenergy problem given by the * p@xmath0p *   hamiltonian ( 8) by an alternative method , first used by evtuhov for the nonspherical valence bands of ge [ 14 ] . as already mentioned , for spherical energy bands the solutions of the eigenenergy problem in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "are given in terms of simple harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "for not too strong deviations from band s sphericity we look for the envelope functions in the form of sums of harmonic oscillator functions with unknown coefficients @xmath111 since our hamiltonian ( 8) contains raising and lowering operators for the harmonic oscillators , it is possible to perform the prescribed operations .",
    "then we multiply the obtained eigenenergy equations on the left by consecutive harmonic oscillator functions and integrate the scalar products using the ortonormality relations .",
    "this results in equations for the coefficients and the condition for nontrivial solutions gives the eigenenergies .",
    "in other words , the evtuhov method is a standard way of transforming a differential eigenvalue problem into an algebraic problem by taking for the complete set of functions the harmonic oscillator functions .",
    "not going into details of the procedure we will give a general scheme for the resulting eigenenergy matrix .",
    "the elementary irreducible block is a 7@xmath587 matrix , one containing the spin - up state and another the spin - down state .",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath9 terms are neglected , the big matrix factorizes into the 7@xmath587 matrices for the spin - up and spin - down energies for consecutive landau levels . the nondiagonal @xmath57 and @xmath9 terms couple the elementary 7@xmath587 matrices .",
    "we find that in order to obtain precise energies for the lowest landau levels we need to go to 70@xmath5870 matrices .",
    "the schematic form of such a matrix is given in eq .",
    "( 21 ) .",
    "@xmath112\\ ] ]    we use a symbolic notation , for example @xmath113 stands for the elementary 7@xmath587 matrix containing the conduction landau level @xmath114 with spin up .",

    "second , sizable difference between the calculations i and i+ii may appear unexpected .",
    "compared to i , the calculation i+ii includes the dresselhaus spin splitting due to bia , which is usually rather small . indeed , for relatively large @xmath101 ( small @xmath102 ) the corrections due to bia are small .",
    "it is at small widths @xmath101 ( large @xmath102 ) that they become appreciable .",
    "one should keep in mind that bia works directly on the spin splitting , i.e. on the @xmath1 value . more generally , the bia spin splitting has somewhat particular properties since , while it is _ affected _ by a magnetic field , its primary origin is _ not _ a magnetic field .",
    "finally , it follows from fig .",
    "3 that the curve i+ii+iii almost coincides with the `` exact '' result .",
    "this means that the third step in the iteration procedure gives enough precision in the calculation of the electron @xmath1-value .",
    "we use this information in the following treatment of the spin splitting in quantum wells .",
    "we apply the above results to calculation of the spin @xmath1-factor for conduction electrons in qws grown along the * z * direction .",
    "we use 5lm and consider both the growth direction and a magnetic field parallel to the [ 001 ] crystal axis .",
    "matrix ( 8) must now be completed by the potential @xmath143 in all diagonal terms . the calculation is carried out by iterating solutions of eq .",
