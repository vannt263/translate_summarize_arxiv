    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are a well - motivated dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "they can be detected directly , via their interactions with nuclei , or indirectly , via their annihilation products , such as high - energy gamma rays , neutrinos or anti - matter ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the signals expected in these channels depend on different aspects of how dm is distributed in the universe : the event rate in direct detection experiments depends on the local dm density and velocity distribution , while indirect searches are sensitive to non - local quantities . in particular , the gamma - ray flux expected from dm annihilations in a given direction in the sky is proportional to the line - of - sight integral of the square of the dm density towards that direction .",
    "for this reason , when comparing results from those two channels , it is essential that the assumptions made about the dm distribution are consistent .",
    "it is also important that the modelling of the dm distribution is as realistic as possible .",
    "when direct detection data are used to constrain the wimp mass and scattering cross - section , it is customary to assume the so - called standard halo model ( shm ) .",
    "the shm postulates a spherical dm halo for the milky way ( mw ) with a density profile that scales as @xmath0 , and an isotropic maxwell - boltzmann speed distribution @xcite .",
    "however , this is in conflict with numerical simulations , which produce dm halos that are not exactly spherical and have speed distributions that can deviate systematically from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite . also , simulated halos have density profiles with logarithmic slopes which vary with radius  @xcite , in contrast to the constant logarithmic slope of the shm .",
    "a more complete description of the mw relies on modelling its matter components , i.e. , the disk , bulge and dm halo .",

    "spherically symmetric halos , this approach allows the reconstruction of the phase - space distribution of dm particles in the mw , @xmath1 . from the latter it is possible to extract a self - consistent dm velocity distribution , @xmath2 , that is in agreement with the inferred gravitational potential of our galaxy @xcite .    in this article",

    "the energy spectrum , morphology and overall normalisation of this excess are consistent with the expectations for wimp annihilations .",
    "in particular , the excess is roughly spherically symmetric and the morphology is consistent with a dm density profile proportional to @xmath3 , with @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the excess is not yet established and alternative astrophysical explanations including cosmic - ray outbursts  @xcite , a population of unresolved millisecond - pulsar - like sources  @xcite , or additional cosmic - ray sources  @xcite have been considered .",
    "if interpreted in terms of dm annihilations , the morphology of this excess can determine , up to a certain degree of accuracy , the inner slope of the dm profile , thereby adding a valuable piece of information to the modelling of the gravitational potential of the mw .    using the mw gravitational potential",
    ", we derive the self - consistent local speed distribution and local dm density .",

    "we did this in two different ways .",
    "firstly we enforced compatibility by simply fixing the logarithmic slope of the dm halo density profile to the value which gives the best fit to the morphology of the galactic centre excess , @xmath24 .",
    "secondly we allowed the inner slope to vary and included the morphology of the galactic centre excess in the data sets used to constrain the mass model . in each case",
    "we used multiple observational data sets , such as stellar kinematics and microlensing , to constrain the parameters of the mass model .",
    "we found that dm halos with an inner slope @xmath23 larger than 1 tend to be more extended , having a larger scale radius @xmath22 and a lower concentration . on the contrary ,",
    "the baryonic component is well constrained by observation in the inner galaxy and from local measurement .",
    "thus , its properties do not change significantly when the gev excess is included in the observational constraints .",
    "we then derived the dm speed distribution from the inferred gravitational potential of the mw in a self - consistent way , in the case an isotropic phase - space density , @xmath80 .",
    "these self - consistent speed distributions have more particles in their high - speed tails than the shm , which is probably related to the fact that the best - fit dm halo is more extended than the shm . also , we have found that this has a significant effect on the cross - section exclusion limit from the lux data . as previously found in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , the best - fit mw mass models have values for the local dm density that are larger than that of the shm , which tightens the exclusion limit for all wimp masses .",
    "the self - consistent speed distributions affect the exclusion limits for low masses , e.g. below 40 gev . for these light wimps ,",
    "the total number of events expected in lux is found by integrating the inverse speed distribution @xmath121 above a @xmath112 of , approximately , @xmath133  km s@xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : halo_general ] ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fv ] ( and shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fv ] and [ fig : eta ] ) , the high - speed tail of the speed distribution is more populated for the generalised nfw halo profiles .",
    "the `` generalised nfw ( @xmath23=1.26 ) '' case yields the largest number of expected events , followed by `` generalised nfw ( free @xmath23 ) '' . therefore the exclusion limits for light wimps are tightest for the `` generalised nfw ( @xmath23=1.26 ) '' case , and both of the generalised nfw models produce tighter exclusion limits than the standard nfw profile . for light wimps",
    "the exclusion limits for the self - consistent velocity distributions differ from that for the shm by tens of per - cent and , depending on the halo profile , can be either tighter or weaker .",
    "we also considered the possibility of a dm halo with an anisotropic velocity tensor , parameterising the @xmath52-dependent component of the phase - space density according to ref .",
    "@xcite . for reasonable ,",
    "fixed values of the anisotropy parameters , the speed distributions are very similar to the isotropic case ( for a given dm density profile ) .",
    "therefore we expect the lux exclusion limits to be very similar to the isotropic case .",
    "marginalising over the unknown anisotropy parameters would , however , significantly increase the uncertainty on both the speed distribution and the exclusion limits .",
    "our work reinforces the need for a consistent interpretation of data from dm experiments .",
    "combining data from different strategies allows not only an improved reconstruction of the properties of dm , but also better control over the uncertainties involved .",
    "the amount of experimental data on dm is rapidly increasing , alongside the precision of theoretical models .",
    "it is , therefore , vital to identify and apply good practice in the way different data sets are combined .",
