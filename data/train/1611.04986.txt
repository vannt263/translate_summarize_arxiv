    "entanglement is a fundamental tool for quantum information processing and quantum metrology . it can be realized in neutral atoms by means of the rydberg blockade @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade inhibits the excitation of more than one atom into rydberg states whose energies are shifted by the interatomic interactions @xcite .",
    "the rydberg blockade has been used in several experiments to generate atom - number entangled states @xcite and to implement a controlled - not quantum gate @xcite .",
    "these quantum operations were realized using a symmetric blockade mechanism , which considers the same rydberg state for all the atoms .",
    "recent theoretical works @xcite propose an asymmetric rydberg blockade involving two different rydberg states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to perform more complex quantum operations .",
    "in the asymmetric rydberg blockade , at least one of the three potentials @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 has to exceed the excitation linewidth of the resonant laser field , while at least another of them has to be much smaller , depending on the desired quantum operation . here",
    ", @xmath5 denotes the potential between two atoms in the rydberg states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "these asymmetric potentials lead to the selective excitation of only those multiatom rydberg states whose interatomic interactions are negligible compared to the excitation linewidth .",
    "the proposals include multiqubit quantum gates @xcite , mesoscopic gates @xcite and a variety of entangled states @xcite , including the so - called greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , @xmath8 which is especially relevant due to its promising applications in atomic interferometers and quantum enhanced measurements @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the asymmetric rydberg blockade finds fundamental obstacles as the atom number is increased , as has been demonstrated in a previous work @xcite . increasing the atom number by",
    "increasing the atom density leads to level crossings between closely spaced atoms , which causes significant changes in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , thus diminish and finally destroying the entanglement process . on the other hand , increasing the atom number while keeping the interatomic separations results in a decrease of the interactions between distant atoms and the consequent reduction of the quantum operation speed .",
    "the situation changes when the atoms are arranged in a cavity .",
    "atoms located in the antinodes of the cavity mode , which mediates the interaction , do interact with each other independent of their spatial separation .",
    "recent progress in loading cold atoms to the surface of a coplanar superconducting microwave cavity of centimeter size @xcite paves the way to a new class of quantum systems with long range interactions .",
    "the electromagnetic field of the coplanar microwave cavity is confined to a small volume around its center conductor , which in combination with the strong electric polarizability of rydberg atoms allows to reach strong coupling between atoms and a cavity mode .",
    "theoretical proposals demonstrated entanglement between atoms and the cavity field @xcite , between atoms and solid state quantum circuits @xcite , and between distant rydberg ( super)atoms @xcite , which can be robust against thermal photons in the cavity @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a novel class of collective coupling between cold atoms and a superconducting coplanar cavity .",
    "we demonstrate a cavity - induced asymmetric rydberg blockade that allows to prepare the atomic ensemble in a ghz state .",
    "since the blockade is induced by the cavity , the entanglement of a large number of particles separated by macroscopic distances of millimeters or even centimeters can be achieved .",
    "the required laser intensities are compatible with the low - temperature conditions of superconducting devices . in this way",
    ", our method overcomes the problems associated with the asymmetric rydberg blockade in free space @xcite .",
    "the proposed system is described in fig .",
    "it consists of @xmath9 neutral atoms trapped in the vicinity of a superconducting coplanar cavity operating in the microwave regime .",
    "the atoms are laser excited from the ground state @xmath10 into two rydberg levels @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 through the fast - decaying , intermediate state @xmath13 by adiabatic rapid passage . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the cavity - mediated interactions are larger than the excitation linewidth if the atoms are in different rydberg states , whereas they are smaller than the excitation linewidth if all atoms are in the same rydberg state . in this way",
    ", the coherent laser excitation process leads the atoms into the entangled ghz state .",
    "we study cavity - mediated interactions in an ensemble of @xmath9 cold atoms that are optically excited into two different rydberg states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to maximize the intensity of the interactions , we select @xmath0 and @xmath1 close to a frster resonance .",
    "this means that there are two other rydberg states , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that the atomic transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 have similar frequencies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "these two atomic transitions are coupled nonresonantly to a cavity mode of frequency @xmath20 . in",
    "the frame rotating with the cavity frequency , the hamiltonian of the atom - cavity interaction is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transition operator of the @xmath23 atom , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the cavity detunings from the atomic transitions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field , and @xmath28 are the atom - cavity coupling rates , which are calculated from the dipole matrix elements @xmath29 of the corresponding atomic transitions and the field per photon @xmath30 within the effective cavity volume @xmath31 . here we have assumed that the coupling rates are the same for all atoms . at the atomic positions , between the central conductor and the ground plate , the electric field is parallel to the @xmath32-axis , so we use only the third component of the electric dipole operator , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the electron charge .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath35-transitions between atomic rydberg states . to calculate the dipole matrix elements we use atomic wavefunctions obtained from a numerov method @xcite and the most accurately measured energies of the rydberg levels @xcite .",
    "we consider the situation in which the cavity detunings , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are much larger than the frster defect , @xmath38 .",
    "this choice diminishes the probability of cavity field excitation by collective photon emission from atoms in state @xmath1 @xcite . in this way , the interaction between two atoms in their respective rydberg states @xmath0 and @xmath1 is dominated by the van - der - waals potential caused by virtual photon exchange .",
    "we simulate this situation with an ensemble of cold @xmath39rb atoms in realistic experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "we select the rydberg states @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the frequency of the atomic transitions is of the order of @xmath44 ghz , with a small frster defect of @xmath45 mhz @xcite .",
    "these transition frequencies correspond to a cavity mode wavelength of @xmath46 1 cm , where @xmath47 is the wavelength in vacuum and @xmath48 6 is the effective dielectric constant . using the first longitudinal mode of the cavity ,",
    "the length of the resonator is @xmath49 . for an electrode distance @xmath50 m , the electric field per photon within",
    "the effective volume of the cavity is @xmath51 0.37 v / m . with these parameters ,",
    "the atom - cavity coupling rates are @xmath52 mhz and @xmath53 mhz . in a cavity with quality factor @xmath54 ,",
    "the photon decay rate is @xmath55 200 khz @xcite , and the condition for strong coupling is fulfilled .",
    "we also assume sufficiently low temperatures to neglect thermal photons in the cavity .",
    "we represent the hamiltonian @xmath56 in the basis of symmetric states , @xmath57 , where the capital letters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the number of atoms in the respective rydberg levels @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath62 is the number of cavity photons . in this section",
    "we omit the number of atoms in @xmath63 and @xmath64 because these states are not coupled to the cavity field . every initial configuration @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is mixed with states @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ; @xmath69 ) by the hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) shows some of these states and the corresponding dipole elements .",
    "the dipole matrix elements in the symmetric - state representation are calculated as @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig2](b ) describes the essentials of the cavity - induced asymmetric rydberg blockade .",
    "it shows the potentials of a series of eigenstates of @xmath56 in an ensemble of ten atoms .",
    "every column in the figure corresponds to eigenstates that mix with the same initial state , @xmath65 , starting in the first column with all atoms in the ground state , @xmath72 , increasing the number of rydberg excitations from left to right , up to the last column with all atoms in rydberg states , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this example , the excitation of all atoms into their corresponding rydberg states is suppressed by the energy shifts in the sequence of intermediate states , even though some intermediate states are near resonance .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that any excitation route with collective states containing atoms in both rydberg levels , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is suppressed by the energy shifts caused by the interatomic potentials .",
    "only excitation routes with the same rydberg state for all atoms are in resonance with the excitation lasers .",
    "the coupling of every eigenstate of @xmath56 to the classical laser fields is proportional to the projection of the eigenstate onto the corresponding initial state @xmath65 .",
    "all the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) have been corrected from the stark shifts of the respective initial states @xmath65 .",
    "these stark shifts , which are calculated as @xmath75 from perturbation theory , are offset by detuning the classical field @xmath76 , and have therefore no effect on the excitation process .",
    "the atomic populations are transferred adiabatically from the ground states into the entangled states using adiabatic rapid passage @xcite .",
    "the atom - field interaction hamiltonian within the rotating - wave approximation is , @xmath77 where the rabi frequencies @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath76 have a typical temporal profile of adiabatic rapid passage , @xmath80 where the maximum peak amplitude @xmath81 mhz is the same along this work ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) . the temporal width @xmath82 is the same for the two laser pulses , although it may vary between different adiabatic transfer processes . in our model",
    "we choose @xmath83 , so the relative delay between the two laser pulses equals @xmath84 .",
    "this choice optimizes the adiabatic transfer efficiency into the rydberg states .    to simulate the adiabatic transfer we transform the operators into the basis of eigenstates of @xmath85 . in this way",
    ", the cavity - mediated interactions appear in the diagonal elements of the total hamiltonian .",
    "then , the dynamics of the system is simulated with the stochastic method of quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "each quantum trajectory represents the time evolution of the wave function , @xmath86 , in a particular thought experiment .",
    "we consider three decay channels : spontaneous decay from @xmath64 into @xmath63 at a rate of @xmath87 mhz @xcite , spontaneous decay from the rydberg states at a rate of @xmath88 khz @xcite and the photon decay rate of the cavity @xmath89 200 khz . during the simulation of each quantum trajectory ,",
    "the computer randomly decides at every time whether the system spontaneously decays according to the current atomic populations and the cavity quantum field state .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the adiabatic transfer into the ghz state for @xmath9=5 .",
    "the populations of states @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which are denoted by the respective density matrix elements @xmath92 and @xmath93 , are represented in fig . [ fig3](b ) for quantum trajectories that evolve without dissipation .",
    "we quantify the entanglement of the state using the von neumann entropy @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the reduced single particle density matrix .",
    "this is calculated as @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 denotes the trace over the hilbert spaces of @xmath98 atoms .",
    "the curve of @xmath99 reveals a significant degree of entanglement already in the first moments of the process , when the atoms have not all been excited into the rydberg states . at the end of the process the entropy reaches its maximum value log(2 ) .",
    "the effect of dissipation is quantified by the accumulated probabilities of spontaneous photon emission from the intermediate state , @xmath100 , and from the rydberg states , @xmath101 .",
    "our simulations show that the spontaneous emission of a single photon cancels the whole entanglement process . indeed ,",
    "the decay of a single atom from @xmath102 projects the whole system into a collective state in which the other atoms are very likely to occupy their respective states @xmath102 .",
    "this is immediately followed by series of collective quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "likewise , the collective spontaneous emission of a single photon from any of the rydberg states acts as a measurement of the whole quantum system because all atoms tend to be in the same rydberg state .",
    "the probability @xmath100 of spontaneous decay from @xmath102 can be reduced by increasing the time parameter @xmath82 , but this leads to higher probability @xmath101 of spontaneous decay from the rydberg states .",
    "an alternative strategy would be to design the temporal profiles of the laser pulse to optimize the adiabatic transfer , but this task is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our simulations also demonstrate that dissipation due to cavity photon loss is not relevant for the considered cavity detunings .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] summarizes the results for 5 and 10 atoms .",
    "it shows the populations @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the von neumann entropy @xmath105 , and the accumulated decay probabilities @xmath100 and @xmath101 at the end of the laser pulse sequence as a function of the temporal parameter @xmath82 .",
    "the curves of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath105 consider only quantum trajectories without spontaneous emission .",
    "increasing the atom number implies more decay channels that reduce the fidelity .",
    "the final populations of @xmath103 and @xmath104 deviate slightly from the ideal value 1/2 as we vary @xmath82 .",
    "this irregularity is caused by high - order interactions between atoms in the same rydberg state @xmath1 .",
    "the importance of these interactions increase with the atom number .",
    "another cause is the low interatomic potentials , which result in a weak blockade mechanism , in the collective states that contain only one atom in @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and the rest of atoms in @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we have described an efficient method for producing multiatom ghz states in atomic ensembles coupled to a superconducting coplanar cavity .",
    "the method relies on the rydberg blockade induced by cavity - mediated interactions .",
    "the adiabatic transfer into the ghz states is carried out through collective dark states . although we have demonstrated our method using particular rydberg states , it is not difficult to find such accidental frster resonances in the rydberg spetra of alkalis , so our entanglement procedure can be generalized to other states .",
    "our proposal requires a good understanding and control over atom - surface interactions , especially the stray electric fields of adsorbed atoms and the casimir - polder potentials , in which significant progress has been made in the last years @xcite .",
    "additionally , stray potentials can be offset by detuning the classical fields @xmath79 and @xmath76 .",
    "this work has been funded by a marie sklodowska - curie individual fellowship ( h2020-msca - if-2014 ) .",
    "project reference : 660732 .",
    "we thank julio camarero for his helpful comments .",
    "to gain more insight into the adiabatic rapid transfer , we derive the equations of the collective dark states .",
    "the dark state is characterized by the destructive interferece between the quantum pathways from @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 into @xmath13 . for a single atom",
    "this condition is expressed by the equation @xmath106 , where @xmath107 are the coefficients of @xmath108 in the atomic wavefunction .",
    "we now generalize this equation to ensembles of @xmath9 atoms .",
    "since all atoms are initially in the ground state , we only consider dark eigenstates that are linear combinations of symmetric collective states @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the number of atoms in @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively . in this appendix",
    "we omit the states that are not coupled by the lasers .",
    "the symmetric dark state is obtained from the set of equations @xmath112 for @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath115 , where @xmath116 denotes the coefficient of @xmath109 in the wavefunction .",

    "<S> these interactions cause an asymmetric rydberg blockade mechanism that suppresses simultaneous excitations into different atomic rydberg levels , thus forcing all atoms to occupy the same rydberg state . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism has effect even if the atoms are separated by distances of the order of millimeters . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic populations are transferred adiabatically from the ground state into the entangled state by following a collective dark state with low dissipation rates . </S>"
