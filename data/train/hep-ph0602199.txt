    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze the structure of the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex @xcite , calculate the fourteen form factors at one loop , and outline some of the phenomenological applications . before proceeding ,",
    "it is worthwhile to review the motivation and current status of gauge - invariant green s functions .    in the conventional formulation of gauge field theories ,",
    "the manifest gauge - invariance of the original action is lost upon quantization , simply because one has to fix a gauge in order to perform calculations .",
    "generically , greens s functions are gauge - dependent and thus not physical by themselves .",
    "only the particular combinations of green s functions which form physical observables must be gauge - invariant .",
    "in many theoretical studies , however , one would like to consider individual green s functions and extract physical meaning from them @xcite .",
    "for example , studies of the infrared behavior of gauge theory using dyson - schwinger equations @xcite often rely on gauge - dependent truncation schemes which one hopes are not too brutal .",
    "the existence of gauge - invariant two - point functions is crucial for defining meaningful resummed propagators @xcite , particularly near threshold , for the construction of effective charges @xcite , for a postulated dressed - skeleton expansion of qcd @xcite , and for justifying renormalon analyses @xcite .",
    "thus there is strong motivation for gauge - invariant green s functions with physical content .",
    "we will now briefly discuss the relationship between three different approaches to gauge - invariant green s functions : ( 1 ) the pinch technique ( pt ) , ( 2 ) the background field method ( bfm ) , and ( 3 ) the @xmath11 effective lagrangian scheme of kennedy and lynn .",
    "all three approaches will lead to the same green s functions .",
    "the pinch technique ( pt ) was first constructed by cornwall @xcite in order to study gauge - invariant dyson - schwinger equations and dynamical gluon mass generation , but the approach is much more generally applicable . in the pt approach ,",
    "unique gauge - invariant green s functions are constructed by explicitly rearranging feynman diagrams using elementary ward identities ( wi ) as the guiding principle .",
    "longitudinal momenta from triple - gauge - boson vertices and gauge propagators inside of loops hit other vertices and thus generate inverse propagators ( via wi s ) , which , in turn , cancel ( or pinch ) some internal propagators .",
    "in this way , certain parts of green s functions are reduced to parts of lower @xmath12-point functions , and should properly be included in the latter .    as an example of the pt , consider the gluon ( or massive gauge boson ) self - energy .",
    "the conventional self - energy is gauge - dependent and physically meaningless by itself .",
    "however , when embedded in any physical process , there will be associated parts of vertex and box graphs which undergo the reduction described above and thus have the same tensor and kinematic structure as the gluon propagator .",
    "these pinched parts are then added to the conventional gauge - dependent self - energy , yielding a gauge - invariant self - energy and gluon propagator that has the correct asymptotic uv behavior dictated by the renormalization group equation .",
    "the resulting two - point function has numerous positive attributes @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , including uniqueness , resummability , analyticity , unitarity , and a natural relation to optical theorem , from which it can also be derived @xcite@xcite .",
    "resumming these two - point functions leads to physical effective charges , @xmath13 grunberg@xcite , which can be extended to the supersymmetric case and leads to an analytic improvement of gauge coupling unification with smooth threshold behavior @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to a variety of green s functions @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite , with applications to electroweak phenomenology @xcite@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex was first constructed in @xcite to one - loop order , where the authors showed that the vertex satisfies a relatively simple abelian - like ward identity .",
    "however , the integrals were not evaluated , so that little could be said about the individual form factors except that the uv divergent term in the tree level tensor structure is correct .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to extend this work by evaluating the integrals for the fourteen form factors , and expressing the results in a convenient tensor basis for phenomenological applications . in doing so , an interesting structure emerges , in which the contributions of gluons(g ) , quarks(q ) , and scalars(s ) are intimately related .",
    "these relations are closely linked to supersymmetry and conformal symmetry , and in particular the @xmath14 non - renormalization theorems . for all form factors @xmath15 in dimensions @xmath0 , we find that f_g+4f_q+(10-d)f_s=0 , which encodes the vanishing contribution of the @xmath14 supermultiplet in four dimensions .",
    "similar relations have been found in the context of supersymmetric scattering amplitudes @xcite@xcite . in appendix e ,",
    "the effects of internal masses are discussed , and the above sum rule becomes modified f_mg+4f_mq+(9-d)f_ms=0 , for internal massive gauge bosons ( mg ) , fermions ( mq ) , and scalar ( ms ) .",
    "the external gluons remain massless and unbroken , so the internal gauge bosons might be the heavy @xmath16 bosons of @xmath17 , for example . in @xcite , supersymmetric relations were found for electroweak gauge boson four - point scattering amplitudes .    the pt method has been explicitly extended beyond one - loop @xcite@xcite@xcite , has recently been proven to exist to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , and interestingly , each green s function is equal to the corresponding green s function of the background field method ( bfm ) in quantum feynman gauge @xmath18 , a result suggested in @xcite@xcite .",
    "heuristically , this is due to the fact that there are no longitudinal ( pinching ) momenta in the gauge propagator or the elementary vertices in this special gauge .    the background field method ( bfm ) @xcite constructs manifestly gauge invariant green s functions in the following way .",
    "first , the field variable(@xmath19 ) in the path integral is separated into a background(@xmath20 ) and quantum(@xmath21 ) field , @xmath22 .",
    "only the quantum field @xmath21 propagates in loops , since it is a variable of functional integration . in contrast , the background field @xmath20 appears only in external legs . by judiciously choosing the gauge - fixing function ,",
    "one arrives at an effective action which remains manifestly invariant under background field gauge - transformations @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , derivatives of the bfm effective action with respect to the background field @xmath20 yield the same 1pi green s functions as the conventional effective action with a nonstandard gauge - fixing .",
    "thus , it can be shown @xcite that the correct s - matrix is obtained by sewing together trees composed of 1pi green s functions of @xmath20 fields . in doing so , one can fix the gauge of @xmath20 , which propagates only at tree level , independently of the gauge fixing of @xmath21 . for example",
    ", convenient non - covariant gauges might be used for the trees while bfm feynman gauge @xmath18 ( bfmfg ) can be used for the loops .    the correspondence between the pt and bfm is not surprising , since the bfm is a formulation of gauge theory where green s functions of the gauge field are manifestly ( background ) gauge - invariant .",
    "although this is true for all values of the quantum gauge - fixing parameter @xmath24 , it is only for the special value @xmath18 that the bfm green s functions also have the correct kinematic structure of the irreducible pt green s functions .",
    "alternatively , it has been shown @xcite that applying the pt algorithm to the bfm for @xmath25 leads back to the canonical ( @xmath18 ) pt green s functions .",
    "finally , in the @xmath11 scheme of kennedy and lynn @xcite , a gauge - invariant effective lagrangian was constructed for electroweak four - fermion processes by explicitly rearranging the one loop corrections . as in the pinch technique",
    ", vertex parts must be added to would - be two point functions to yield genuine two - point functions .",
    "one particular motivation is that fact that the photon acquires a spurious mass from its mixing with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , unless the correct vertex parts are added .",
    "the resulting effective charges , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in fact precisely equal to the corresponding pinch - technique effective charges at one loop , including all finite terms and threshold dependence @xcite .    thus , all three methods for constructing physical gauge - invariant green s functions lead to the same results , which in the this paper will be referred to as either pt or pt / bfmfg green s functions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will discuss the general structure of the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex , which is constrained by the ward identity and bose symmetry .",
    "two convenient tensor bases and their relation are discussed . in section 3",
    ", the main results of this paper are given .",
    "first , the nontrivial supersymmetric relations between the gluon , quark , and scalar contributions to each form factor are discussed .",
    "the explicit results for the form factors are given in two different bases for massless internal particles , with the full mass effects relegated to appendix e. in section 4 , we briefly discuss the phenomenological application to physical scattering processes , where we derive an effective coupling for the three - gluon vertex , @xmath6 , and an effective scale , @xmath30 , both of which depend on three distinct gluon virtualities . in section 5 , the phenomenological effects of internal masses are discussed .",
    "a complicated threshold and pseudo - threshold structure emerges .",
    "furthermore , a three - scale effective number of flavors @xmath9 is defined .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 . in appendix",
    "a , a brief outline of the calculational method is given , and some basic one- and two - point integrals are given .",
    "appendix b is devoted to a thorough discussion of the massive triangle integral , and analytic continuations are given for each kinematic region .",
    "appendix c collects some useful results for special functions .",
    "appendix d explains the corrections to the form factors when a supersymmetric regularization is used .",
    "finally appendix e gives explicitly the corrections to the form factors arising from internal massive gauge bosons , fermions , and scalars .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex discussed in this paper is the relatively simple ward identity it satisfies , which has the same form as the ward i d satisfied by the tree level vertex .",
    "this was proven at one - loop in the original paper by cornwall and papavassiliou @xcite using the explicit one - loop result , which is the gluon part of eqs.([fullvertex],[gqsdef ] ) below .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the fermion and scalar parts also satisfy the same ward identity ( just as in qed ) .",
    "furthermore , the equivalence of the bfmfg and pt to all orders @xcite allows one to write the ward identity satisfied by the three - gluon vertex to all orders as [ wardid ] p_3^_3__1_2_3^abc(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = f^adc ( t__1_2(p_2 ) ^db + _ _ 1_2^db(p_2 ) ) -f^adc ( t__1_2(p_1 ) ^da + _ _ 1_2^da(p_1 ) ) , plus two other equations which are cyclic permutations .",
    "the transverse tensor @xmath31 comes from the tree level term . here",
    "all momenta are defined to be incoming and all labels are defined in counter - clockwise fashion , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . this ward identity represents a great simplification compared to the usual slavnov - taylor identities satisfied by the conventional gauge - dependent three - gluon vertex , which involves the gluon propagator , the ghost propagator , and the ghost - ghost - gluon vertex function .",
    "the self - energy function in the above equation is not the usual gauge - dependent self - energy , but rather the gauge - invariant pinch technique self energy , which is the only self energy discussed in this paper .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the longitudinal ( @xmath32 ) part of the vertex , defined as the part which contributes to the above ward i d , must have only the antisymmetric color factor @xmath33 so long as gluons conserve the color charge , @xmath34 . as far as we know ,",
    "the transverse ( @xmath35 ) part of the vertex ( defined by @xmath36 ) is not required to be proportional to @xmath33 , but may in principle contain @xmath37 terms .",
    "nevertheless , no such terms appear at one or two loop order , and so in the subsequent discussion we take _ _",
    "1_2_3^abc(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = f^abc__1_2_3(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) , in terms of which the ward identity becomes [ wardid2 ] p_3^_3__1_2_3(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) = t__1_2(p_2 ) ( 1+(p_2 ^ 2 ) ) -t__1_2(p_1 ) ( 1+(p_1 ^ 2 ) ) .",
    "bose symmetry , the fact that 3 identical particles are entering the vertex , and the properties of @xmath33 imply definite properties of @xmath38 under the interchange of labels . in particular , defining the five elements of the permutation group @xmath39 to act by @xmath40 and @xmath41 one finds that @xmath42 yields @xmath43 when acting on @xmath38 .",
    "the nonabelian nature of the permutation group @xmath39 prevents one from finding a basis in which all of the tensors are eigenstates of all of these operators .",
    "thus , aesthetic and physical principles must guide us in choosing convenient bases , two of which are discussed momentarily .",
    "let us consider the most general tensor structure .",
    "the three index lorentz covariant tensor must be constructed out of the metric @xmath44 and the momenta ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "since the momenta are not independent , @xmath46 , simple combinatorics implies that there are in general 14 independent tensor components , 6 of which have one power of momenta and also the metric , and 8 of which have 3 powers of momenta .",
    "many different basis choices can be made , although we will use essentially two .    in the subsequent discussion",
    ", some efficient notation will prove useful .",
    "this is summarized in table 1 .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48    thus , each tensor is rewritten as a 3 slot object , where slots correspond to @xmath49 in that order , and the content of each slot is either ` 1',`2 ' , or ` 3 ' to represent momentum @xmath50 , or a ` 0 ' , which must occur in pairs and represents that those two indices are connected by the metric tensor .",
    "the most naive thing to do would be to just eliminate one momenta , say @xmath51 and use the following 14 basis tensors : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "this is not very useful since the explicit bose symmetry between the three gluons has been broken , and thus delicate relations between the form factors will have to enforce it .",
    "a more natural choice is obtained by starting from a manifestly symmetric , but redundant basis , which has 36 possible basis tensors , 9 with one power of momenta , and 27 with three powers of momenta . as a step towards our final basis ,",
    "we find it convenient to eliminate all such tensors with momenta @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , i.e. anything with 1 in the first slot , 2 in second slot or 3 in the third slot .",
    "this yields the 14 basis tensors @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath54 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , which are shown in table 1 .",
    "note that under the action of @xmath76 we have @xmath77 , etc .",
    "also , notice that @xmath53 and @xmath68 are interchanged by the action of @xmath78 , while @xmath61 and @xmath63 are interchanged by the action of @xmath79 , etc .",
    "thus , it is convenient to take appropriate linear combinations such that one of these interchange operators is diagonal for each tensor .",
    "such basis tensors are @xmath80 where the notation means @xmath81 , so that @xmath82 , etc .",
    "the subscripts are chosen because , for example , @xmath83 is an eigenstate of @xmath79 , etc .    suppressing indices and momentum dependence , the three - gluon vertex",
    "is then written as @xmath84 where the lower case letters represent the basis tensors , while the upper case letters are the form factors , which depend on @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to indicating which basis tensors they are associated with , the subscripts on form factors also indicate the ordering of momenta in the arguments . for example , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the first two arguments are either symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "the behavior of these form factors under @xmath39 can be inferred from the behavior of the basis tensors under @xmath39 ( which will be discussed momentarily ) , along with the overall requirement for the vertex given below eq .",
    "one finds that @xmath90 , and thus @xmath91 , etc .",
    "similarly , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is totally invariant under the interchange or permutation of any momenta , while @xmath96 goes to @xmath97 under any interchange of momenta , but is invariant under a cyclic permutation @xmath76 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that under the action of the permutation operator ( @xmath76 ) these fourteen basis tensors are organized into four triplets , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , as well as @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the latter two are eigenstates of all five operators .",
    "consider the properties of @xmath98 under the permutation group .",
    "it is easy to see that under the action of any element @xmath104 , we have (    cccc _ 12 + _ 23 + _ 31    ) g_i (    cccc _ 12 + _ 23 + _ 31    ) , with the matrices given by @xmath105    the transformation rules are identical for @xmath106 , and similar for @xmath107 and @xmath108 with the only change being that there is no minus sign in the three interchange operators @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the basis constructed above ( eq.([pmbasis ] ) ) will be called the @xmath111 basis . as discussed later ,",
    "this basis is the most convenient for phenomenology and furthermore the form factors exhibit particularly simple relations between the gluon , quark , and scalar contributions ( eqs.([qgsumpm],[qgsumsym ] ) ) .",
    "however , the @xmath111 basis as it stands does not contain the tree level tensor structure .",
    "thus , one is naturally led to diagonalizing the permutation operator @xmath76 .",
    "which commute are @xmath76 and its inverse @xmath112 .",
    "thus one can diagonalize these two , or one of the interchange operators @xmath113 . ] clearly , this is the most symmetric choice and , more importantly , one of the resulting eigenvectors is the tree level tensor structure .    in the triplet representation of @xmath39",
    ", @xmath76 is diagonalized by the similarity transformation s = 1 (    ccc 1 & 1 & 1 + 1 &  & + 1 & &     ) s^-1g_123s _ 123 = (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 &  & 0 + 0 & 0 &    ) , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 are cube roots of unity .",
    "this results in new basis tensors and form factors @xmath116 this procedure is repeated identically for the @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 basis tensors and form factors .",
    "notice that @xmath120 is the tree level tensor , which is why the extra factors of @xmath121 were included above .",
    "the transformation properties for the basis tensors @xmath122 and @xmath123 are deduced from @xmath124 given above , @xmath125 , and _ 12 = - (    cccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 1 & 0    ) _ 23 = - (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 &  + 0 & & 0    ) _ 31 = - (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & + 0 &  & 0    ) , while the transformation properties of the form factors are deduced by demanding that behavior given below eq.([gops ] ) is respected .",
    "for example , since @xmath126 under @xmath127 , we find @xmath128 so that @xmath129 . for @xmath117 and @xmath119 , the only change in the above",
    "is that there is not a minus sign in @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we have not touched @xmath102 and @xmath103 , as these are already eigenstates of all five operators @xmath42 , with eigenvalues @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "we will call the above constructed basis the symmetric @xmath111 basis . note that any basis can be symmetrized in the same manner by diagonalizing the permutation operator @xmath76 .",
    "the basis we started with in eq.([pmbasis ] ) is motivated by ( a ) its simple and symmetric construction from only metrics and @xmath134 , ( b ) it is the most convenient basis for perturbative calculations , as will be discussed in section 4 , and ( c ) the individual form factors have a relatively simple form , as will be discussed in section 3 .    for some theoretical studies , another convenient basis is determined by the distinction between transverse ( @xmath35 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath32 ) tensors @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 tensors contribute to the ward i d ( or the more complicated slavnov - taylor i d for the gauge dependent vertex ) while the @xmath35 tensors satisfy homogeneous equations @xmath135 .",
    "this is a very convenient basis for evaluating the loop corrections to the vertex , since the @xmath32 and @xmath35 parts separate , as described in appendix a.    the @xmath111 basis and the @xmath136 basis are complementary in the following sense .",
    "the @xmath111 basis is constructed out of combinations of longitudinal ( @xmath137 ) and transverse ( @xmath138 ) momenta , so that for example @xmath139 vanishes if the @xmath140 index is contracted into a conserved current . meanwhile , the @xmath136 basis distinguishes between parts of the vertex that do ( @xmath35 ) and do not ( @xmath32 ) vanish when dotted with longitudinal momenta .",
    "these straightforward relations to current conservation and ward identities are essentially the reason these two bases are the most convenient to work with .    in our notation , the vertex can be written in the @xmath136 basis as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and the bar distinguishes this @xmath136 basis from the @xmath111 basis defined above in eq.([pmbasis ] ) . the relation between basis tensors",
    "is given by @xmath143 and we used @xmath144 .",
    "this implies the relation between form factors @xmath145 the unwritten form factors ( @xmath146 , etc . ) and basis tensors can be obtained trivially from the above equations by cyclic permutation ( @xmath76 ) . in doing so",
    "it is useful to keep in mind the properties described under eq.([3gvertex ] ) , along with @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , while @xmath151 and @xmath152 have the same transformation properties as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we will present the results for the form factors in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 using dimensional regularization ( dreg ) , for gluons in the adjoint representation , and massless quarks and scalars in arbitrary representations .",
    "the corrections due to supersymmetric regularization and massive fermions , scalars , and gauge bosons are given in detail in appendices d and e , respectively .",

    "the quark and scalar integrals come straightforwardly from the one loop triangle diagrams .",
    "the notation and routing of the integral are defined in fig.([fig:1 ] ) such that @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and the tree level vertex @xmath159 and @xmath160 are defined as @xmath161    all massless integrals can be reduced to two basic scalar integrals : @xmath162    these functions , and the massive integrals which are considered later , are summarized in appendices a and b , where @xmath163 is written in terms of clausen functions . in the following we will suppress the momentum arguments and write our results in terms of @xmath164 .      before presenting the results for individual form factors , which are somewhat lengthy , we will discuss the relationship between the gluon(g ) , quark(q ) , and scalar(s ) contributions .",
    "we will end up finding relations similar to those found in the context of supersymmetric scattering amplitudes @xcite@xcite@xcite . for a generic form factor @xmath15 ,",
    "let us write the one - loop contribution as [ fdef ] f = ig^2(c_af_g + 2_f t_f n_f f_q + 2_s t_s n_s f_s ) , where the coupling constant @xmath165 and group theory factors have been pulled out .",
    "the standard notation is used , so that @xmath166 for @xmath167 , and @xmath168 = t_f \\d^{ab}$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath169 stands for the contribution of one dirac fermion in the fundamental representation of @xmath167 , or , due to a symmetry factor of @xmath170 for weyl fermions , the contribution of adjoint gluinos divided by @xmath171 .",
    "similarly , @xmath172 stands for the contribution of one complex scalar in the fundamental representation , or the contribution of a real scalar in the adjoint , divided by @xmath171 . these identifications will be used shortly .",
    "after explicitly calculating the integrals in eq.([gqsdef ] ) , we noticed that the gluon , quark , and scalar contributions have a similar structure for each form factor . to make this explicit ,",
    "define the following sums for form factor @xmath15 : @xmath173    although the results for each form factor are often long , these sums are particularly simple , as can be seen in eqs.([qgsumlt],[qgsumpm],[qgsumsym ] ) . for all form factors in any basis , it also turns out that [ sgqg ] ( d-10 ) _ sg = 8 _ qg and @xmath174 is always proportional to @xmath175 .",
    "the above two equations and the results of eqs.([qgsumlt],[qgsumpm],[qgsumsym ] ) can be used to determine the @xmath21 and @xmath96 contributions to any form factor , given the gluon contributions written explicitly below .",
    "furthermore , eqs.([sumdef],[sgqg ] ) can be combined leading to [ gqssum ] f_g + 4f_q + ( 10-d)f_s = 0 .",
    "considering the very different origins of each form factor ( eqs.([fullvertex],[gqsdef ] ) ) , it is remarkable that they are related in such a simple manner .",
    "note that no such analogous relation holds for the gauge dependent vertex @xcite .",
    "this type of relation hints at supersymmetry . to further understand the content of these relations",
    ", we will consider various supersymmetries in @xmath176 .",
    "*   from the above definitions , it is clear that a vector superplet @xmath177 ( gluons plus gluinos ) contributes @xmath178 to a generic form factor @xmath15 , while @xmath179 chiral superplets contributes @xmath180 . by the sum rule eq.([gqssum ] ) in @xmath176 , we have @xmath181",
    ". thus any form factor can be written f = ig^2(n_cf_v_1+n_f_)=ig^23_0^(n=1)f_v_1 , where @xmath182 is the first @xmath183 function coefficient .",
    "hence the contributions of vector and chiral superplets have precisely the same functional form for each form factor .",
    "furthermore , every form factor is proportional to @xmath184 even though all but one of them are uv finite . *   here",
    "the vector superplet gives @xmath185 , while @xmath186 hyperplets ( a weyl fermion of each helicity plus a doublet of complex scalars ) yield @xmath187 .",
    "the sum rule eq.([gqssum ] ) can be written as @xmath188 , and thus f = ig^2(n_cf_v_2+n_hf_h)=ig^22 _ 0^(n=2 ) f_v_2 , where @xmath189 . *   here",

    "given the complicated structure of the full mass dependent form factors , such tools for characterizing and understanding the behavior of the vertex are helpful .",
    "however , in a real calculation such methods may be of limited use and the full mass dependent results should be used .",
    "for example , the effective scale @xmath369 has been defined only in the massless case so far because the definition becomes complicated and somewhat arbitrary in the massive case . in particular , consider the possible definition ( for qcd ) : @xmath370 \\nonumber\\\\   & \\equiv &   \\bigg ( { 11c_a\\over 3 } - { 2\\over 3}\\sum_q   \\tilde{n_q}\\left({a\\over m_q^2},{b\\over",

    "furthermore , in the approach advocated here , the couplings at each vertex depend on physical momentum scales which will typically be integrated over in the phase space .",
    "thus , matching onto a conventional @xmath301 type approach can only be done at the end of the calculation , so that trying to define a @xmath312 at an intermediate stage is not very useful .",

    "this constitutes a multi - scale analytic renormalization scheme that contains information which can not be obtained in the simple single - scale leading - log renormalization methods . in other words ,",

    "this will allow for a more precise determination of coupling from data , as well as giving the three - loop @xmath183 function coefficient .",
    "furthermore , by the ward identity in eq.([wardid ] ) , this also yields the longitudinal form factors of @xmath374 through two loops .    the gauge - invariant pt / bfmfg quark self - energy turns out to be equal to the conventional self - energy in the feynman gauge @xcite , and so is known through two - loops @xcite . due to the ward identity @xcite satisfied by the pt / bfmfg quark - gluon vertex ,",
    "this also yields the longitudinal form factors of @xmath375 through two loops .        to summarize , in this paper we have analyzed the behavior of the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex at one - loop .",

    "only four form factors remain , rather than the thirteen which would be present in a generic basis .",
    "nonetheless , the choice of basis is only a matter of convenience , and the real physics lies in the thirteen non - vanishing form factors given explicitly in section 3 .",

    "only the gluon contributions to the form factors are given explicitly in section 3 , while the quark and scalar contributions are inferred from the homogeneous relation @xmath210 and the results for the relatively simple sums @xmath376 which are given in section 3 for each form factor @xmath15 .",
    "the extension to the case of internal masses is outlined in appendix e and leads to the modified sum rule @xmath377 .",
    "the phenomenology is largely determined by the form factor of the tree - level tensor structure , which in section 4 is used to define a three - scale effective charge @xmath300 .",
    "in addition , the characteristic scale @xmath367 governing the behavior of the vertex and the effective charge was analyzed , thus providing a natural extension of blm scale setting @xcite to the three - gluon vertex .",
    "physical momentum scales always set the scale of the coupling .",
    "the phenomenological effects of quark masses are discussed in section 5 and are found to be important for generic physical applications , since decoupling is slow and a complicated threshold and pseudo - threshold behavior is observed .",
    "an important next step is to fully apply these techniques to a physical process . in the future",
    "we will present such an analysis for the hadronic production of heavy quarks , where the importance of the form factors other than the tree - level one ( @xmath253 ) will be addressed .",
    "the interpretation of the pseudo - threshold phenomena also deserves further study .        in order to evaluate the integrals in an efficient manner",

    "of course there is only one integration momenta @xmath378 , which can be chosen to be @xmath379 or @xmath380 , thus breaking the cyclic symmetry .",
    "however , using the symmetric labeling greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "first we decompose the full vertex @xmath381 into longitudinal ( @xmath32 ) and transverse ( @xmath35 ) parts , @xmath141 , as in eq.([ltbasis ] ) .",
    "the tensor integrals in eq.([gqsdef ] ) are then converted into scalar integrals by applying projection operators . in doing so , the longitudinal ( @xmath32 ) and transverse ( @xmath35 ) parts essentially decouple , and the ten independent @xmath32 form factors",
    "are easily found either directly , or by solving the ward i d , resulting in eq.([lffs ] ) .",
    "the remaining four @xmath35 parts are found by applying the following four projection operators to eq.([gqsdef ] ) : @xmath382 and @xmath74 , where as in table 1 we have defined @xmath383 , etc .",
    "thus , for the gluon contribution @xmath154 we have four scalar integrals : @xmath384 and @xmath385 . similarly , there are four integrals for the quarks and scalars as well . in the numerator of each of these integrals",
    "there will be various dot products of momenta , which can always be reduced to momentum squares using eq.([loopmom ] ) .",

    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that i_200=-i_100 i_020=-i_010",
    "i_002=- i_001 .",
    "thus we are left with only two types of integrals : ( 1 ) the trivial two point integrals @xmath391 , @xmath392 , and @xmath320 , where j_1= i_100= = , and ( 2 ) the master triangle integral j j(p_1 ^ 2,p_2 ^ 2,p_3 ^ 2 ) = .    for the gluon contribution , for example , one then has a system of four equations with four unknowns , the transverse form factors . denoting the gluon contribution to the longitudinal projections by @xmath393 , etc .",

    "<S> the gauge - invariant three - gluon vertex obtained from the pinch technique is characterized by thirteen nonzero form factors , which are given in complete generality for unbroken gauge theory at one loop . </S>",
    "<S> the results are given in @xmath0 dimensions using both dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction , including the effects of massless gluons and arbitrary representations of massive gauge bosons , fermions , and scalars . </S>",
    "<S> we find interesting relations between the functional forms of the contributions from gauge bosons , fermions , and scalars . </S>",
    "<S> these relations hold only for the gauge - invariant pinch technique vertex and are d - dimensional incarnations of supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems which include finite terms . </S>",
    "<S> the form factors are shown to simplify for @xmath1 , and @xmath2 supersymmetry in various dimensions . in four - dimensional non - supersymmetric theories , </S>",
    "<S> eight of the form factors have the same functional form for massless gluons , quarks , and scalars , when written in a physically motivated tensor basis . for qcd , </S>",
    "<S> these include the tree - level tensor structure which has prefactor @xmath3 , another tensor with prefactor @xmath4 , and six tensors with @xmath5 . in perturbative calculations our results lead naturally to an effective coupling for the three - gluon vertex , @xmath6 , which depends on three momenta and gives rise to an effective scale @xmath7 which governs the behavior of the vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of nonzero internal masses @xmath8 are important and have a complicated threshold and pseudo - threshold structure </S>",
    "<S> . a three - scale effective number of flavors @xmath9 is defined . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this paper are an important part of a gauge - invariant dressed skeleton expansion and a related multi - scale analytic renormalization scheme . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the scale ambiguity problem is resolved since physical kinematic invariants determine the arguments of the couplings .    </S>",
