    "it is well known that size , shape and surface effects play an important role in nanostructures , e.g. nanoparticles and nanoclusters ( np and nc ) @xcite . for a macroscopic crystal",
    "these effects can be neglected because its surface to volume ratio is sufficiently small and despite of a formally broken translation symmetry , one can still use periodic boundary conditions to accurately describe the observed bulk behavior .",
    "a typical example is the famous bloch @xmath0 law for the temperature dependence of magnetization in ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "however , even in the macroscopic limit , this picture is incomplete as demonstrated by formation of magnetic domain walls as a result of energy balance between the demagnetization ( or stray ) field and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "for sufficiently small ( dozens of nm ) samples a single domain structure is stabilized , resulting in a large uncompensated magnetic moment @xmath1 ( we use lattice spacings as length units so that @xmath2 is the number of atoms ) , @xmath3 is the magnitude of internal magnetization @xcite .",
    "the latter is directly related to the superparamagnetic relaxation at temperatures above @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the curie temperature ) and to the blocking effect at lower temperatures .",

    "it is also known that np magnetization depends on its geometric shape and is affected by contact with an external medium , e.g. by embedding or coating .",
    "these properties are of major importance for applications and , at the same time , raise a fundamental challenge for understanding their connection to the shape and size of a nanostructure or to the specific boundary conditions on its surface . from the phenomenological description it is not possible to tell how this information is encoded in the fitting parameters or whether these can be given a microscopic meaning at all .    in the following",
    "the above issues are discussed in the context of the proposed generalization of the microscopic bloch theory of bulk ferromagnets .",
    "an important new aspect is that , in contrast to the bulk material , coupling to environment can affect not just the surface of a nanostructure but its properties as a whole .",
    "an essential role is played by the collective excitations ( magnons ) , the mediators of such effects .",
    "on the one side , magnons are sensitive to boundary conditions ( bc ) and at the same time involve all the constituent magnetic moments of the crystal ; on the other side , they dominate the low energy part of the magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "these features are well captured by the quantum spin-@xmath44 heisenberg model with nearest - neighbour exchange coupling .",
    "the shape anisotropy is taken into account by considering a rectangular crystal of a general form @xmath45 , while the effect of environment is modeled by the choice of boundary conditions on its surface .",
    "it is clear that standard periodic bc ( pb ) are even qualitatively insufficient since existence of a surface is totally ignored in this case .",
    "we therefore use a @xmath46 generalization of the heisenberg spin chain hamiltonian considered in @xcite , where the bc are controlled by the external field @xmath47 acting on the crystal surface . as will be shown below a realistic description is achieved by analysing the main classes of possible bc at finite values of the coupling field .",
    "some physical implications of the results will be demonstrated with a specific example of quantum monte - carlo cluster simulation .",
    "in a finite system it is important to make a distinction between the uniform excitation mode @xcite , @xmath48 magnon , and the usualor dispersive magnon modes because they contribute to the observed @xmath25 in a different way .",
    "the latter are mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of the magnitude of the magnetization @xmath49 while the former accounts for the thermal fluctuations of its direction ( which defines the z - axis ) with respect to the anisotropy axis , i.e. the @xmath48 mode describes the rotation of the vacuum of the dispersive magnons .",
    "this can be understood by examining the magnon dispersion for a simple cubic lattice : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bohr magneton and planck s constant is omitted .",
    "the spectrum of a finite magnet is gapped and at low energies can be approximated as @xmath52 where @xmath53  . for not too large @xmath54 the energy scale @xmath55 of the uniform",
    "( @xmath56 ) mode is lower than the magnon excitation gap between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath28 the temperature dependence of @xmath25 appears to be dominated by the uniform mode described by harmonic oscillations of the magnetization axis ( @xmath58 axis ) in the potential well created by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and , as already mentioned , is described by eq .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) .",
    "this expression is well justified when thermal energy is lower than the magnon gap , @xmath59 since then @xmath60 is exponentially close to @xmath61 .",
    "however , the linear temperature dependence of @xmath25 for the interval @xmath62 was deduced from the assumption that @xmath63 follows the bloch law or its phenomenological generalization in eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) , where @xmath64 , see @xcite . instead",
    ", the microscopic analysis presented below shows that @xmath65 contains quasi - linear @xmath66 components and therefore its temperature dependence can not be ignored .    to calculate the low temperature expansion of @xmath67 we neglect the anisotropy field in magnon dispersion ( its inclusion will not qualitatively change the results ) and exponentially small terms like @xmath68",
    "@xmath69the issue is whether there exist a general formula that embodies the diversity of physical conditions defined by size , shape and bc contained in eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "the problem of surface boundaries in a @xmath46 system presents an additional interest because even the analytic form of the magnon dispersion has not been discussed before except for limit cases .",
    "we will therefore consider the examples representative of the main classes of bc .",
    "in numerical simulations the most studied is the case of free bc ( fb ) , when magnon wave numbers in eq .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) are quantized as follows : @xmath70 clamped bc ( cb ) represent a limit opposite to fb , when the surface spins are virtually fixed by the strong border fields @xmath71 .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the form of the respective magnon wave functions which are coordinate products of @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( compare to the uniform distribution of spin deviations for the periodic bc ) .",
    "fortunately , the discrete schrodinger equation can be solved also at finite values of the interface fields .",
    "namely , we will consider the case of a particle embedded ( eb ) in a medium with coupling comparable to the internal fields of the np , i.e. @xmath74@xmath75note that for a different coupling strength quantization of collective excitations may slightly differ , e.g. for @xmath76 when @xmath77 we should replace @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , while magnon amplitudes preserve the @xmath79 -function dependence similar to cb .",
    "in addition to the above uniform bc one may define another physically distinct class , mixed bc ( mb ) , when the coupling to environment is non - uniform and may differ from side to side . as a representative we take the example of a np with all sides free except one at @xmath80 .",
    "for the same coupling strength as in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) we obtain the following wavenumbers:@xmath81 these eigenvalues are further used to calculate the quantum statistical average in eq .",

    "however the finite-@xmath89 terms can not be treated in the same way because in addition to the large argument @xmath90 we now have three more ( i.e.@xmath91 ) parameters taking large values in the order index of the bessel function and the known uniform asymptotics @xcite does not lead to further progress .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented if we renounce to the straightforward @xmath92 expansion and consider an expansion in the scaled parameters @xmath93 these parameters represent the ratios between thermal energy and the lowest magnon gap for a given bc ( divided by @xmath94 for computational reasons ) .",
    "the integral representation of the bessel function allows then to develop a generalized low temperature expansion in terms of the @xmath95 variables .",

    "the condition @xmath105 defines a crossover temperature @xmath106 separating the exponential regime ( @xmath107 ) from power law @xmath32dependence ( @xmath108 ) . in the former case the low-@xmath92 polynomial expansion of the @xmath109 ( the bloch series )",

    "explicit form of the @xmath122 coefficients is used in the calculations , however it is not essential for understanding the main trends .",
    "the last terms ( the main finite size terms ) of the two expressions in eq.([feb ] ) only differ in sign . we see that , relative to the the bulk material , magnetization is decreased ( increased ) for the free ( embedded ) sample . unlike eq.([2a ] ) , this result provides a transparent representation of the physical reasons for such behavior . note that size dependence is dominated by the smallest linear extent of the np , e.g. nanoplates of the same thickness or nanorods of the same diameter",
    "should generally have close values of @xmath27 although their volume can differ significantly .",
    "suppression of magnetization in free particles , known from many numerical simulation and experimental studies , is due to enhanced fluctuations of the surface spins ; respectively , a way to increase magnetization is embedding ( or coating ) the magnetic particle into a polarizable medium which couples to the surface spins .",

    "the contrasting behavior of the two classes of bc is enhanced further by the shape anisotropy as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , unlike eq.([feb ] ) , this dependence is qualitatively modified depending on the shape of the particle , as can be seen from the two examples below : @xmath129 for the elongated shape , @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 for the flattened shape .",
    "thus , the highest magnetization is reached when coupling to environment ( @xmath133 ) inhibits spin fluctuations on the interface , while the lowest corresponds to a free np when surface spins can fluctuate more freely .",
    "however , we describe below another mechanism introduced by the third class of bc , which amends this picture and suggests additional possibilities to control magnetization .",
    "indeed , applying mixed bc breaks the uniformity of coupling over the surface of np , this activates simultaneously both the opposite tendencies discussed earlier ( enhancement and suppression of spin fluctuations ) resulting in a totally different behavior .",
    "this is most convincingly demonstrated by the conclusion that the lowest magnetization is actually achieved not for a free standing np but in this class of bc . the effect is formally contained in the other kind of jacobi @xmath29 - function , @xmath134 which appears in our low - @xmath92 expansion .",
    "the outcome of the two competing tendencies is represented by the two cases when mb conditions are applied to an initially free np : ( a ) @xmath133 at the smallest side of the crystal , @xmath117 , and ( b ) @xmath133 at the largest side of the same crystal , @xmath135 . @xmath136",

    "a specific example that the latter is misleading , despite of its good performance as a data fitting formula .",
    "in particular , it largely overestimates magnetic softening in nanostrutures and the true softening is better captured by the proposed form of the modified bloch law .",
    "magnetization consists of two contributions : the bloch term for the bulk material , and the size - dependent part including effects of geometric shape and coupling to surrounding medium .",
    "such coupling can strongly modify the properties of a nanostructure through a mechanism mediated by collective excitations .",
    "boundary conditions can cause a large variation of magnetic polarization .",
    "for instance , embedding a free unpolarized np in a polarizable medium may induce a magnetic moment which can exceed even the bulk value , an effect strongly enhanced by shape anisotropy . for an asymmetric shape one can increase or even decrease the magnetization of a free standing np depending on the contact area , suggesting an interesting possibility of controlling magnetization .",
