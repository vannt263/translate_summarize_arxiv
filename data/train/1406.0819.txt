    "the hegselmann - krause ( hk ) bounded confidence model of opinion dynamics , in its original one - dimensional setting introduced in @xcite , works as follows .",
    "we have a finite number @xmath0 of agents , indexed by the integers @xmath15 .",
    "time is measured discretely and the opinion of agent @xmath16 at time @xmath17 is represented by a real number @xmath18 , where the convention is that @xmath19 whenever @xmath20 .",
    "there is a fixed parameter @xmath21 such that the dynamics are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "as the dynamics are obviously unaffected by rescaling all opinions and the confidence bound @xmath1 by a common factor , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a vector of opinions .",
    "we say that agents @xmath16 and @xmath26 _ agree _ if @xmath27 . a maximal set of agents that agree",
    "is called a _ cluster _ , and the number of agents in a cluster",
    "is called its _",
    "size_. the configuration @xmath28 is said to be _ frozen _ if @xmath29 whenever @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to see that , if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related as in ( [ eq : update ] ) , then @xmath33 if and only if @xmath31 is frozen .",
    "thus once opinions obeying the hk - dynamics become frozen , they will remain so for all future time .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental result about the hk - dynamics is that any configuration of opinions will freeze in finite time .",
    "there are multiple proofs of this in the literature , but the same fact is true for a wide class of models of which hk is just one particularly simple example , see @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the time taken for a configuration to freeze is bounded by a universal function of the number @xmath0 of agents . currently , the best upper bound is @xmath34 , due to @xcite .",
    "an important open problem in the field is to find the optimal bound .",
    "it was noted in @xcite , and even earlier in @xcite , that one definitely can not do better than an @xmath35 bound . for suppose",
    "we start from the configuration @xmath36 , so opinions are equally spaced with gaps equal to the confidence bound .",
    "then it is not hard to see that , as the configuration updates , if @xmath37 then the opinions of agents @xmath16 and @xmath38 will remain constant as long as @xmath39 , while both will change at @xmath40 . hence , the time it takes for the configuration @xmath41 to freeze is at least @xmath42 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath43 seems like a good candidate for a configuration which converges as slowly as possible simply because , at the outset , opinions are placed as far apart as they can be while retaining an unbroken chain of influence . as it turns out , this intuition is badly wrong - in a companion paper @xcite we will exhibit configurations of @xmath0 agents which , as @xmath44 , take time @xmath45 to freeze",
    ". configurations of equally spaced agents nevertheless remain interesting for other reasons .",
    "krause @xcite has observed , based on simulations for values of @xmath0 up to @xmath46 or so , that the configuration @xmath41 seems to evolve in a very regular manner .",
    "our main result confirms , and makes completely precise , krause s hypotheses . before stating it , we introduce some graph - theoretic terminology .",
    "let @xmath25 be a vector of opinions .",
    "we can define a _ receptivity graph _ @xmath47 , whose nodes are the @xmath0 agents and where an edge is placed between agents @xmath16 and @xmath26 whenever @xmath48 .",
    "we say that agents @xmath16 and @xmath26 are _ connected _ if they are in the same connected component of the receptivity graph . observe that every connected component of @xmath47 is an interval of agents and that @xmath16 is disconnected from @xmath49 if and only if @xmath50 .",
    "we can now state our theorem :    [ thm : main ]",
    "let @xmath51 be an integer , and write @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "suppose that at @xmath54 we have the opinion vector @xmath41 and we let it evolve according to ( [ eq : update ] ) .",
    "then the following occurs :    \\(i ) after every fifth time step , a group of three agents will disconnect from either end of the receptivity graph and then collapse to a cluster in the subsequent time step .",
    "\\(ii ) the final , frozen configuration , will consist of @xmath55 clusters of size @xmath4 with opinions distributed symmetrically about @xmath56 plus , if @xmath57 , one cluster of size @xmath58 with opinion @xmath56 .",
    "\\(iii ) the configuration will freeze at time @xmath59 , where @xmath60    [ rem : kurz ] the formula for the freezing time for @xmath0 agents can be written as @xmath61 this formula is given in @xcite , but without proof .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] will be proven in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we investigate more generally the evolution of a configuration of equally spaced agents , when the inter - agent spacing is an arbitrary number @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we will show that the evolution is periodic also for some other values of @xmath10 , though not all , while numerical and heuristic evidence suggests nevertheless that something `` close '' to periodicity might hold for arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "we will show that , for a small range of values of @xmath10 slightly above @xmath63 , the behaviour is periodic , with groups of four agents disconnecting after every eighth time step , which leads to a freezing time of @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath43 does not even converge most slowly amongst equally spaced configurations .",
    "we conjecture , however , that any equally spaced configuration of @xmath0 agents will freeze in time @xmath11 , and present numerical evidence suggesting that , as @xmath13 , the freezing time may be closer , in order of magnitude , to the diameter @xmath14 of the configuration rather than the number @xmath0 of agents .",
    "for @xmath64 set @xmath65 if @xmath51 , there is a natural map @xmath66 given by @xmath67 = ( x(2)-x(1),\\dots , \\ , x(n)-x(n-1)).\\ ] ] the update rule ( [ eq : update ] ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a row - stochastic @xmath71 matrix .",
    "note that the entries of @xmath70 depend only on the receptivity graph @xmath72 at time @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath51 then , setting @xmath74 , we can just as well write the update rule as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is an @xmath78 matrix with non - negative entries , though the row sums will no longer equal one in general . as before , the entries of @xmath77 depend only on the graph @xmath72 . we will find it more convenient to work with ( [ eq : matrixb ] ) rather than ( [ eq : matrixa ] ) , in other words to replace a vector @xmath79 of opinions by a vector @xmath80 of gaps between opinions .",
    "observe that @xmath81 , a vector which we denote @xmath82 . more generally ,",
    "if the receptivity graph corresponding to @xmath79 is connected , then the entries of @xmath83 are bounded above by one .    to get a feeling for theorem [ thm : main ] , we look at @xmath84 as an example .",
    "what is important is what happens during the first five time steps . at @xmath85",
    "it is obvious that @xmath86 thus , @xmath87 from which it is in turn clear that @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the entries of all subsequent vectors @xmath90 will of course all be rational numbers , but we will write approximations to four decimal places so as to make it easier to keep track of magnitudes . at the next time step we have @xmath91 thus @xmath92 and @xmath93 still and so @xmath94 still @xmath95 and",
    "so @xmath96 now finally something happens .",
    "since @xmath97 , agents @xmath2 and @xmath4 are now connected , and similarly with agents @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "thus @xmath100 which leads to @xmath101 hence , @xmath102 here @xmath103 exactly , which means that agents @xmath2 and @xmath104 agree , as do agents @xmath105 and @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , @xmath106 , which means that agent @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath107 ) has become disconnected from agent @xmath108 ( resp .",
    "@xmath98 ) .",
    "this is in accordance with part ( i ) of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "it is easy to continue and check that agents @xmath109 will collapse to a cluster at @xmath110 , as will agents @xmath111 , whereas the remaining agents @xmath112 will collapse to a cluster at @xmath113 , in accordance with ( [ eq : remainder ] )",
    ".    we can now give a rough outline of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "given @xmath114 , we proceed as follows : +   + step 1 : show that the receptivity graph @xmath72 , and hence the transition matrix @xmath77 , is constant for @xmath115 , whereas @xmath116 contains the two extra edges @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus @xmath119 .",
    "then show that @xmath120 , which implies that three agents become disconnected at each end .",
    "if @xmath121 , then each group of three agents will collapse to a cluster at @xmath122 .",
    "+   + note that we have already completed this step .",
    "the calculations above verify it for @xmath123 and it is clear that , if we then increase @xmath0 , it will not affect how the opinions of the first or last four agents evolve over the first five time steps .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath0 can not be `` felt '' before every agent has changed their opinion at least once which , as we remarked earlier , will not happen while @xmath124 .",
    "+   + step 2 : thus at @xmath125 , three agents break free from each end of the configuration .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath126 agents and a corresponding vector of gaps @xmath127 .",
    "we now reset time to zero and consider @xmath128 as the new initial configuration .",
    "for example , with @xmath123 we have , by ( [ eq : y5 ] ) , @xmath129 the entries of @xmath128 will lie in @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "the idea is to show that they lie sufficiently close to @xmath2 such that , if still @xmath131 , then the evolution of the receptivity graph over the next five time steps will be exactly the same as if all entries equalled @xmath2 . to complete the proof",
    ", we have to be able to iterate this procedure , and finally verify the theorem directly for @xmath132 - indeed , we need to verify for these values of @xmath0 that the behaviour is unaffected if the starting values in @xmath133 are all in @xmath130 $ ] and sufficiently close to @xmath2 .",
    "+    to complete step 2 , it is convenient to extend the hk - model to an infinite sequence of agents , more precisely to a well - ordered infinite sequence so that geometrically there is an agent furthest to the left . indeed , ( [ eq : matrixa ] ) and ( [ eq : matrixb ] ) make perfect sense if we regard @xmath31 and @xmath90 as elements of @xmath134 , the vector space consisting of all infinite , well - ordered sequences of real numbers , and @xmath70 , @xmath77 as appropriate linear operators on this space .",
    "let @xmath135 denote the element of @xmath134 representing a sequence of equally spaced agents with gaps of one .",
    "the obvious analogue of theorem [ thm : main ] would be the following :    [ thm : infmain ] the evolution of the configuration @xmath136 under ( [ eq : update ] ) is periodic , namely after every fifth time step a group of three agents will disconnect on the left and then collapse to a cluster at the subsequent time step",
    ".    our strategy will be to first prove theorem [ thm : infmain ] and then argue that the behaviour is essentially unaffected when we go back to finite sequences .",
    "+    to begin with , we define precisely the machinery we need , using the standard notation and terminology of functional analysis .",
    "an element of @xmath134 will be denoted by a well - ordered sequence @xmath137 of real numbers .",
    "recall that @xmath138 denotes the subspace of @xmath134 consisting of bounded sequences .",
    "it is a banach space with norm @xmath139 .",
    "we let @xmath140 denote the element of @xmath138 consisting entirely of ones . for a linear operator @xmath141 , its norm is defined as @xmath142 .",
    "one says that @xmath143 is bounded if @xmath144 and @xmath145 denotes the banach space of all bounded linear operators on @xmath138 .",
    "let @xmath146 be a doubly - infinite matrix and set @xmath147 if @xmath148 is finite then the map @xmath143 given by @xmath149 is a well - defined element of @xmath145 of norm @xmath148",
    ". the map can be written as a matrix product @xmath150 , when @xmath79 is written as an infinite column .",
    "we now consider a specific collection of operators @xmath151 , @xmath152 defined by matrices satisfying ( [ eq : sup ] ) . in all cases , the elements @xmath153 will be non - negative and there will be only finitely many non - zero entries in each row , i.e. : for each @xmath16 we have @xmath154 for all @xmath155 .",
    "set @xmath156 let @xmath157 be a threefold leftward shift , i.e. : @xmath158 and finally let @xmath159 be the composition @xmath160 the point is that , firstly , the evolution under ( [ eq : update ] ) of an infinite sequence of equally spaced agents is described for @xmath161 by @xmath162 secondly , at @xmath125 , the first three agents become disconnected .",
    "hence , the map @xmath163 describes what happens if we take a sequence of equally spaced agents , run the hk - dynamics over @xmath3 time steps , remove the first three agents which have become disconnected from the others , and reset time to zero .",
    "these assertions follow from ( [ eq : y1])-([eq : y4 ] ) and ( [ eq : y5 ] ) , together with the observation that , whenever @xmath133 is a multiple of @xmath164 , so that all its entries are equal , then @xmath165 for all @xmath166 and all @xmath167 .",
    "now we need to show two things : +   + claim 1 : if @xmath168 and @xmath169 for some sufficiently small @xmath170 , then @xmath171 still describes , as above , the evolution over @xmath3 time steps of a sequence of agents with initial inter - agent spacings given by @xmath172 .",
    "+   + claim 2 : for all @xmath173 , @xmath174 is sufficiently small so that claim 1 can be applied . +    verifying these two claims will not immediately allow us to complete step 2 above . given",
    "a finite sequence of @xmath0 equally spaced agents , these two claims allow us to iterate as in step 2 up as far as @xmath175 , i.e. : as long as agents in the middle have not yet been affected , because up to that point the evolution of either half of the finite sequence is exactly the same as for the corresponding initial segment of the infinite sequence . in order to continue the iteration beyond this time , we will use the precise quantitative estimates obtained in the proofs of the two claims below . basically , the idea is that the entries of @xmath176 remain much closer to one than is needed for claim 1 to hold , so that even though the entries of the finite and infinite sequences diverge when @xmath177 , the accumulated divergence never becomes so large so that we can not apply claim 1 .",
    "the precise argument will follow the verification of the two claims .",
    "+    claim 1 is actually a statement about the operators @xmath151 , @xmath178 .",
    "we prove the following :    [ prop : claim1 ] let @xmath179 represent the gaps between consecutive agents in an infinite sequence of agents , indexed by @xmath180 , and let @xmath181 be the corresponding receptivity graph .",
    "for each @xmath182 , let @xmath183 , and let @xmath184 be the corresponding graph . if @xmath185 and @xmath186 then the following hold :    \\(i ) for each @xmath187 , @xmath72 contains exactly the edges @xmath188 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath116 contains the edges of @xmath189 plus the additional edge @xmath190 ,    \\(iii ) @xmath191 contains all the edges of @xmath116 except for the edge @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , @xmath193 . +",
    "hence claim 1 holds with @xmath194 .",
    "we already know that ( i)-(iii ) hold when @xmath195 .",
    "now take @xmath196 . as remarked earlier , since @xmath197 is a multiple of @xmath164",
    ", all its entries from the sixth onwards will remain unchanged for @xmath167 .",
    "so , when considering the evolution of the graph @xmath72 , it suffices to consider the first five entries of each vector @xmath198 .",
    "since every entry of @xmath197 lies between @xmath199 and @xmath2 , it is immediate that @xmath181 is as claimed in ( i ) .",
    "we have @xmath200 for all @xmath73 , where the @xmath90 are as in ( [ eq : y1])-([eq : y4 ] ) and ( [ eq : y5 ] ) except that we have an infinite sequence of ones from the sixth position onwards .",
    "numerically , @xmath201 @xmath202",
    "@xmath203 @xmath204 @xmath205 note that @xmath206 exactly , as may be readily checked . for sequences",
    "@xmath207 , write @xmath208 if @xmath209 for every @xmath16 and observe that , if @xmath210 is a doubly - infinite matrix satisfying ( [ eq : sup ] ) , having non - negative entries and at least one non - zero entry in each row , then @xmath211 . now if @xmath212 and @xmath213 , then @xmath214 .",
    "hence @xmath215 would hold for all @xmath167 , but for the fact that the first entry of each vector is zero at @xmath125 . by comparing ( [ eq : y1])-([eq : y4 ] ) ,",
    "( [ eq : y5 ] ) with ( [ eq : z1])-([eq : z5 ] ) , and noting in particular that both @xmath216 and @xmath217 , it follows immediately that ( i)-(iii ) all hold for the @xmath218 .",
    "we now turn to claim 2 .",
    "first of all , let us write out @xmath219 explicitly as a doubly - infinite matrix .",
    "the upper - left @xmath220 block is @xmath221 every other entry in the first three rows is zero , and every row from the fourth onwards is just a rightward shift of the third row , i.e. : @xmath222 note that the sum of the entries in every row from the third onwards equals @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath223    [ prop : claim2 ] let @xmath224 and for all @xmath225 , @xmath226 .",

    "then for all @xmath230 , @xmath231 @xmath232 ( iii ) the sequence @xmath233 converges in @xmath138 to a fixed point of @xmath219 .",
    "the reason for using @xmath228 instead of @xmath73 is that multiplication by @xmath219 is to be thought of as representing the evolution of a configuration of agents over @xmath3 time steps .",
    "hence , one can informally imagine that `` @xmath234 '' .",
    "since the sum of the entries in every row of the matrix of @xmath219 is at most one it is immediate that @xmath235 .",
    "since @xmath219 has non - negative entries , it follows by induction that @xmath227 for every @xmath228 , which proves ( i ) .",
    "note that ( iii ) follows from ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , so it remains to prove ( ii ) .",
    "the inequalities in ( [ eq : bound1])-([eq : bound3 ] ) are obviously satisfied when @xmath236 . hence , by ( i )",

    "for the right - hand inequalities , we proceed by induction on @xmath228 .",
    "first consider @xmath237 .",
    "we have @xmath238 assuming ( [ eq : bound1])-([eq : bound3 ] ) hold at step @xmath228 , it follows that ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) holds at step @xmath239 if and only if @xmath240 , where @xmath241 +   ( 1-b)\\ , \\mathcal{t}(1,\\,2 ) \\ , ( 1+\\gamma).\\ ] ] we checked with ` matlab ` that @xmath242 has two solutions in the interval @xmath243 $ ] , at @xmath244 and @xmath245 , and that @xmath246 for @xmath247 .",

    "theorem [ thm : main ] describes a striking regularity in the evolution when @xmath366 .",
    "one motivation for looking at other values of @xmath10 is the observation that there exists some @xmath367 such that theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : infmain ] hold verbatim for all @xmath368 $ ] .",
    "indeed , this follows immediately from an examination of the argument in section 2 . to begin with ,",
    "observe that the initial receptivity graph is identical for all @xmath369 , namely it is just a chain .",
    "next , let s consider an infinite sequence of agents .",
    "proposition [ prop : claim1 ] tells us that the evolution up to @xmath370 is identical for all @xmath371 . in proposition",
    "[ prop : claim2 ] we just replace @xmath372 by a multiple @xmath373 of itself and rescale all inequalities - for example , the analogue of ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) will read : @xmath374 .",

    "the obvious question then is to what extent something like theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : infmain ] continues to hold as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "figure [ fig : ini ] below suggests that something very interesting may be going on .    on the horizontal axis , we plot @xmath10 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "starting from 1 and decreasing to 0.005 , we ran for each value of @xmath10 a simulation of @xmath375 agents . is ` 0.005.^(linspace(1,0,100)).^2 ` ] this gives the configuration a diameter of @xmath376 , so that for all times @xmath377 the edge of the configuration look like the edge of an infinite system with the same @xmath10 .",

    "this explains our notation .",
    "the red circles record the products @xmath381 .",
    "there are two obviously striking features in figure [ fig : ini ] .",
    "firstly , @xmath380 does not seem to be increasing as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "it is not constant - recall that theorem [ thm : infmain ] says that @xmath382 , while the figure shows that @xmath380 can attain any value among @xmath383 . indeed ,",
    "all these values are already attained in the interval @xmath384 $ ] , see table [ tab : ini ] below .",
    "moreover , @xmath385 for `` most '' values of @xmath10 simulated with @xmath386 , whereas @xmath387 for most values with @xmath388 .",
    "this may suggest logarithmic growth .",
    "when @xmath10 gets really small then simulations become impractical . however , it is obvious to ask          these two questions concern only the behaviour up to the first disconnection in the receptivity graph .",
    "the meat in theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : infmain ] is that this behaviour is then repeated , forever in the case of an infinite sequence of agents and until there are less than @xmath395 agents left in the finite case .",
    "it turns out that such simple periodicity does not hold for arbitrary @xmath10 , though there is a lot of evidence that the behaviour is always `` close '' to periodic .",
    "the rest of this section will be concerned with developing this assertion .",
    "if we accept it for the moment , then following on from questions [ quest : ldbound ] and [ quest : dmd ] we can ask about the freezing time for an arbitrary configuration of equally spaced agents . if the evolution were perfectly periodic for all @xmath10 then , as @xmath13 , question [ quest : dmd ] would imply that the freezing time is @xmath396 $ ] for @xmath397 .",
    "notice that @xmath14 is the diameter of the configuration . as question [",
    "quest : ldbound ] suggests @xmath380 grows very slowly , if at all , this would imply that , for general @xmath10 , the diameter is a much better measure of the freezing time than the number of agents .",
    "indeed , a universal bound on @xmath380 would in turn suggest an affirmative answer to the following :    [ quest : freeze ] does there exist a universal positive constant @xmath398 such that , for any finite configuration of equally spaced agents obeying ( [ eq : update ] ) , the freezing time is at most @xmath399 , where @xmath400 is the diameter of the configuration ?    to appreciate how far we are from being able to answer any of the questions posed so far , we can not even prove that , for all @xmath10 and @xmath397 , the receptivity graph must actually disconnect at all ! nor can we prove even an @xmath35 bound for the freezing time , independent of @xmath10 . on the other hand , the intuition that equal spacings of @xmath366 should yield the most slowly converging configuration turns out to be false , even amongst equally spaced configurations .",
    "we will prove below that for a short interval of @xmath10-values slightly above @xmath63 , the freezing time is @xmath11 .",
    "we conjecture that this is the worst - case scenario :    [ quest : linearbound ] is it true that any configuration of @xmath0 equally spaced opinions , which evolve according to ( [ eq : update ] ) , will freeze by time @xmath401 , where @xmath402 is an absolute constant ?",
    "let s now go into more detail . in what follows ,",
    "we denote @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "proposition [ prop : claim1 ] says that the behaviour up to the first disconnection in the receptivity graph is identical for all @xmath10 in a half - open interval to the left of @xmath366 .",
    "basically , the reason for this is that , before the disconnection , edges are only added to the graph , not removed . consider a fixed edge @xmath405 with @xmath406 and a fixed @xmath407 .",
    "if this edge is added to the graph at time @xmath73 it means that ( 1 ) @xmath408 , whereas ( 2 ) @xmath409 .",
    "if we now decrease @xmath10 and assume that the evolution of the graph is identical up to time @xmath410 , then clearly ( 1 ) will still hold , while ( 2 ) will hold for all @xmath411 $ ] for some @xmath170 .",
    "hence , if edges are only added , never deleted , before the first disconnection , then the evolution of the graph during this period will be identical for all @xmath412 $ ] , where @xmath413 will in general depend on @xmath414 - in particular , it will likely be smaller if the time @xmath415 at which the disconnection occurs is greater",
    ". we may ask whether this is what indeed always happens :    [ quest : added ] is it true that , for every @xmath391 $ ] , edges are only added to the receptivity graph , never deleted , before the time @xmath378 at which it disconnects ?",
    "consequently , is it true that there is a decreasing sequence @xmath416 such that the evolution of the graph up to the first disconnection , and hence the values of the functions @xmath380 and @xmath379 , are constant on each interval @xmath417 $ ] ?",
    "moreover , does the sequence @xmath418 tend to zero ?    by exhaustive computation",
    "we have constructed the sequence ( [ eq : dec ] ) down to @xmath419 , which is a natural threshold as it marks the point at which the receptivity graph is more than just a chain at @xmath85 .",
    "table [ tab : ini ] below shows the @xmath420 different possibilities for the evolution prior to disconnection of an infinite sequence of agents for all @xmath369 .",
    "the rightmost column in the table describes the precise evolution . here",
    "@xmath421 are operators on @xmath138 , considered as bi - infinite matrices .",
    "@xmath422 is what we called @xmath423 in section [ sect : pfmain ] , the operator corresponding to when the receptivity graph is just a chain .",
    "@xmath424 is what we previously called @xmath425 , corresponding to addition of the edge @xmath190 .",
    "for @xmath426 we in turn add the edges @xmath427 , @xmath428 and for @xmath429 we then add the edges @xmath430 , @xmath431 .",
    "@xmath432 denotes a shift operator .",
    "we take @xmath433 and the map @xmath434 describes the evolution up to time @xmath380 , followed by removing the segment of size @xmath379 which has become disconnected .",
    "@xmath435 to verify that this list is complete can be reduced to a finite computation . to get a flavour of how this works , consider @xmath436 .",
    "if @xmath437 and @xmath438 one may verify that @xmath439 and @xmath440 .",
    "this means that the edges @xmath441 and @xmath442 will be added to the graph at @xmath443 when @xmath444 but not when @xmath445 , so at @xmath444 the behaviour changes .",
    "if now @xmath446 then @xmath447 , which means that adding the edges @xmath448 and @xmath449 at @xmath443 would result in the removal of edge @xmath355 , and hence a disconnection of the graph , at @xmath370 for any @xmath450 $ ] . however , this is a faithful description of the evolution only down to @xmath451 , because then the behaviour changes already at @xmath452 . for",
    "if instead @xmath453 and @xmath454 then @xmath455 so the edge @xmath117 is already added at @xmath452 .    now notice from the table that the quotient @xmath456 is not maximised at @xmath457 , it attains greater values of @xmath458 and @xmath459 at @xmath460 and @xmath461 respectively . for values of @xmath10 in the very narrow interval",
    "@xmath462 $ ] , however , the subsequent evolution is not periodic , rather after a finite amount of time , the behaviour will hop to that exhibited in the interval @xmath463 $ ] .",
    "we will return to this later .",
    "however we can prove that , for @xmath10 lying in some subinterval of @xmath463 $ ] , the behaviour is periodic .",
    "\\(i ) if the initial configuration @xmath466 evolves according to ( [ eq : update ] ) then the evolution is periodic : after every eighth time step , a group of four agents disconnect from the left - hand end of the receptivity graph and collapse to a cluster at the subsequent time step .",
    "\\(ii ) there are positive constants @xmath467 such that the finite configuration @xmath468 will evolve in an analogous manner , with a group of four agents becoming disconnected at each end after every eighth time step , until there are at most @xmath469 agents left in the middle .",
    "these will collapse to a cluster after at most @xmath470 further time steps .",
    "note that the statement in the finite case is slightly less precise than in theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "this is because , already for @xmath471 , the evolution of the graph is not constant for @xmath472 $ ] . as may be verified by direct computation , three different things can happen and the freezing time can be @xmath473 or @xmath105 . in any case , the important point about theorem [ thm : slowerd](ii ) is that the freezing time is @xmath11 .",
    "the proof is completely analogous to that given in section [ sect : pfmain ] so we only present a sketch .",
    "table [ tab : ini ] yields an immediate analogue of proposition [ prop : claim1 ] , namely : for an infinite sequence of agents with initial spacings given by @xmath179 , if @xmath474 , then the evolution up to @xmath475 is identical to that described in the @xmath476 row of the table , i.e. : @xmath477 secondly , consider the bi - infinite matrix @xmath478 .",
    "analogously to ( [ eq : tblock ] ) and ( [ eq : trest ] ) , all the `` action '' takes place in the upper - left @xmath479 block , and every row from the sixth onwards is just a shift to the right of the previous row .",
    "the sum of the entries in every row from the fifth onwards equals one .",
    "let @xmath480 respectively denote the sums of the entries in the first four rows .",
    "one can check that @xmath481 one can prove the following analogues of ( [ eq : bound1])-([eq : bound3 ] ) , the proof reduced as before to solving ( in ` matlab ` ) a finite collection of polynomial equations : +      note that , according to ( [ eq : newdrowsums ] ) , there are row sums both above and below one , and thus the sequence @xmath485 is not monotonic as in proposition [ prop : claim2](i ) .",
    "thus the left - hand inequalities in ( [ eq : newbound1 ] ) and ( [ eq : newbound2 ] ) also contribute to the collection of polynomial equations to be solved here .",
    "in addition , because of the lack of monotonicity , it is not immediately obvious that @xmath486 converges in @xmath138 to a fixed point of @xmath478 .",
    "though computations suggest this is definitely the case , we have not tried to prove it as we do nt need the result .",
    "now it follows from ( [ eq : newbound1])-([eq : newbound4 ] ) that , for all @xmath225 and @xmath487 $ ] , @xmath488 + @xmath489 .",
    "this is much less than half the length of the interval @xmath463 $ ] .",
    "so as long as we do nt choose @xmath10 too close to the edges of the interval , the behaviour described in part ( i ) of theorem [ thm : slowerd ] for an infinite sequence of agents has been established . in the case of a finite sequence of @xmath0 agents",
    "there will be additional `` perturbations '' once agents in each half of the sequence affect one another , and these can be analysed by introducing operators @xmath490 and vectors @xmath491 analogous to ( [ eq : replace ] ) and ( [ eq : yzdefs ] ) . in ( [ eq : replace ] ) , @xmath492 replaced elements of an input @xmath79 in groups of five and moved this window three steps to the left as @xmath228 increased .",
    "in the present case , @xmath493 will replace elements eight at a time and move the window four steps to the left each time . in imitating the argument on page 8 , we must exercise a little caution since @xmath494 , which in ( [ eq : tbort ] ) would lead to an exponentially growing bound for @xmath307 .",
    "however , since @xmath495 is essentially a `` band matrix '' and the sum of the entries in each row from the fifth onwards is one , multiplying by @xmath478 will not magnify errors until @xmath496 , in fact until @xmath497 , where now @xmath498 indeed we still have much more margin for error here than in section [ sect : pfmain ] so we can continue replacement up to @xmath499 and obtain the following analogues of ( [ eq : triangle ] ) and ( [ eq : deltat ] ) : @xmath500 \\approx 0.0054,\\ ] ] thus @xmath501 .",
    "this is still less than @xmath502 , which proves that the evolution of the configuration of @xmath0 agents up to time @xmath503 will be periodic , at least for all @xmath10 in some sufficiently small interval around the centre of @xmath463 $ ] . at time @xmath504",
    "there will be somewhere between @xmath107 and @xmath505 agents left , depending on @xmath506 , so the proof of the theorem is complete .",
    "theorems [ thm : infmain ] and [ thm : slowerd ] prove that , at least for some values of @xmath369 , the evolution of the configuration @xmath466 is periodic , with @xmath379 agents becoming disconnected on the left after every @xmath380 time steps . such simple periodicity does not hold for arbitrary @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath10 is close to some @xmath418 , @xmath507 , and hence close to the boundary between the two intervals @xmath508 $ ] and @xmath509 $ ] , then the evolution can jump from one `` state '' to another after a finite time .",
    "this is why the ratio @xmath510 does not yield a configuration which converges even more slowly than in theorem [ thm : slowerd ] .",
    "recall from table [ tab : ini ] that the interval @xmath462 $ ] is very narrow .",
    "one can check that , starting with @xmath511 , a group of @xmath108 agents will disconnect at @xmath512 , as in table [ tab : ini ] , but at this point the gap between the first two remaining agents will be @xmath513 , which will suffice for the evolution to jump into a new state whereby the next group of @xmath108 agents disconnect after @xmath107 further steps ( at @xmath514 ) .",
    "in fact , the system will remain in that state forever , as can be proven by explicit computation and following the proof of theorem [ thm : slowerd ] .",
    "in fact , a system can take arbitrarily long to jump from one state to another . to see this",
    ", we consider values of @xmath10 slightly above @xmath515 .",
    "for @xmath516 let @xmath517 , @xmath518 and @xmath519 . by proposition [ prop : claim2 ] , we know that the sequence @xmath520 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath138 and converging toward a fixed point @xmath521 of @xmath522 . since , as one can readily check , the matrix @xmath523 has non - negative entries and row sums at most one , the same is true of the sequence @xmath524 .",
    "hence , @xmath525 is an increasing sequence , starting from @xmath526 and converging to a limit @xmath527 , which numerically is about @xmath528 .",
    "it is easy to see that , if @xmath529 $ ] , then starting from the configuration @xmath466 , it will happen @xmath0 times that @xmath4 agents disconnect after @xmath3 time steps , whereas on the @xmath530:st occasion , 3 agents will disconnect after @xmath108 steps instead .",
    "indeed , one can check ( though the computations become extremely messy ) that the system will then forever remain in the latter state .",
    "this leads us to our final question :    [ quest : ultimate ] is it true that , for any @xmath391 $ ] , the evolution of the system @xmath466 is ultimately periodic , in the sense that both the time between successive disconnections and the number of agents which disconnect are constant from some point onwards ?    given the ideas introduced in this paper , answering this last question for @xmath369 at least could perhaps be reduced to a finite , if extremely messy computation . however",
    ", this would not yield much insight into what happens as @xmath13 , which is the main theme behind all the questions posed in this section . the proofs in this paper",
    "all relied heavily on explicit numerical estimates ( as in ( [ eq : bound1])-([eq : bound3 ] ) and ( [ eq : newbound1])-([eq : newbound4 ] ) ) . to push the work further",
