    "the quantization of energy in the potential wells generates quantum states that can be used in quantum information processing .",
    "the quantum dynamics as well as the readout of the quantum state are then governed by the tunneling between different minima of the potential .",
    "it is thus crucial to know the appropriate macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) rate of the phase for an arbitrary potential shape .",
    "although this quantity can be calculated numerically in a general one- or multi - dimensional potential , it is much more convenient to have an analytical solution when possible . in the following ,",
    "we show that for a general quartic potential and a symmetric sextic potential it is still possible to derive an analytical solution for the mqt rate .",

    "usually , the precise shape of the potential depends on certain bias parameters .",
    "most of the experiments on superconducting circuits are performed with current - biased josephson junctions .",
    "the relevant potential for the phase is then the so - called tilted washboard potential  @xcite .",
    "if the bias current is close to the critical current , the washboard potential is well approximated by a cubic polynomial with a local potential minimum from which the phase can escape into a continuum by tunneling . however",

    "the quantum states become weakly sensitive to current noise . in this region ,",
    "the relevant potential has a quartic contribution and presents two escape points .",
    "this working point was used in the experiment of ref .  , where a phase qubit was created in the so - called camel - back potential of a dc squid . for this experiment ,",
    "the results of the present paper can be used for simulations and data processing  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the expression of the mqt rate in a general quartic potential from which tunneling occurs through two possible escape paths , as depicted in fig .",

    "<S> macroscopic quantum tunneling of the phase is a fundamental phenomenon in the quantum dynamics of superconducting nanocircuits . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate can be controlled in such circuits , where the potential landscape for the phase can be tuned with different external bias parameters . </S>",
    "<S> precise theoretical knowledge of the macroscopic quantum tunneling rate is required in order to simulate and understand the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present a derivation , based on the instanton technique , of an analytical expression of the escape rate in general quartic and symmetric sextic potentials comprising two escape paths . </S>",
    "<S> these new potentials were recently realized when creating a noise - insensitive phase qubit in the camel - back potential of a dc squid . </S>"
