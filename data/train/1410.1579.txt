    "let @xmath93 be the first such operation .",
    "since the only new edge is @xmath77 , the subgraph @xmath64 must contain both @xmath51 and @xmath57 ; and it can not contain @xmath36 since the only edge removed is @xmath94 . recall that @xmath51 was the leftmost vertex that @xmath36 is adjacent to ; and by invariant  ( i1 ) , we know @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 for some @xmath101 , and we have @xmath102 after the shift . since @xmath57 was the rightmost vertex adjacent to @xmath36 before the shift , all outgoing edges of @xmath36 went to vertices in @xmath103 .",
    "the outdegree of @xmath36 was at least @xmath104 before the shift , hence @xmath105 had at least @xmath106 edges , which is a contradiction .",
    "now , after executing the algorithm , we are left with a multigraph where the outdegree of every vertex is at most 3 , and no subgraph induced by @xmath107 consecutive vertices has more than @xmath108 edges .",
    "this , combined with invariant  ( i1 ) , implies that the multiplicity of any edge @xmath109 is at most one .",
    "thus , for every vertex @xmath36 , the ( at most ) three outgoing edges go to vertices at distance at least @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath98 , respectively , from @xmath36 . denoting by @xmath35 the number of @xmath15-monotone paths that start at @xmath112 , we arrive at the recurrence @xmath113 with initial values @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the recurrence solves to @xmath114 where @xmath24 is the unique real root of the cubic equation @xmath25 .",

    "every convex polygon is star - shaped , and so the @xmath145 lower bound on the number of convex polygons in a triangulation on @xmath0 points ( from the previous paragraph ) also holds for star - shaped polygons .",
