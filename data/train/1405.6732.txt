    "the curvature - square inflation originally proposed by starobinsky @xcite occupies a unique position in inflationary cosmology @xcite because it only requires a single additional term in the einstein ",
    "hilbert action instead of a new scalar field  a functional degree of freedom .",
    "despite its simplicity , @xmath2 inflation is fully consistent with the state - of - the - art cosmological observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by wmap @xcite and planck @xcite , which report the scalar spectral index @xmath3 @xcite , tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 @xcite , and the @xmath5 parameter measuring possible deviation from gaussianity of curvature perturbations being consistent with zero .",
    "recently , the bicep2 experiment @xcite announced the detection of b - mode polarization of the cmb on relatively low multipoles with its amplitude corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "this is an epoch - making discovery if it is confirmed to be due to the primordial gravitational waves , but at the moment , the possibility that the detected signal is entirely due to polarized dust has been ruled out only at 2.2@xmath7 level @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out recently that the effect of foreground dust may have been even larger , so that only an upper bound on @xmath8 can be obtained as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense , we had better not conclude in haste that @xmath2 inflation , which predicts @xmath9 , has been ruled out by the latest observations of b - mode polarization .    turning our attention to more theoretical aspects , this model is so simple that it had not been investigated in the context of modern high - energy theory including supersymmetry and supergravity , which would be the only theories that allow us to use the usual perturbative quantum field theory without a fine - tuning up to scales relevant to inflation and necessary to embed it in the most promising candidate of the quantum theory of gravity , the superstring theory .",
    "it is only recently that @xmath2-type inflation was studied based on supergravity @xcite supergravity has also been proposed @xcite and its cosmological consequences have been studied @xcite . but its insufficiency as a supersymmetric theory has been pointed out recently @xcite . see also @xcite for supersymmetric models that have a potential similar to the starobinsky model . ] , although its basic framework was already known in the late 1980s using the old - minimal supergravity @xcite or the new - minimal supergravity @xcite , which were obtained by the gauge fixing of the superconformal theory .",
    "one of the most important messages of these studies is that higher - order corrections such as the @xmath0 term will arise as the nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 term on the starobinsky model can be seen easily when we go to the scalaron picture , which is the dual theory of @xmath10 theory that consists of a scalar field and the einstein ",
    "hilbert action . in the scalaron picture",
    ", the starobinsky model has a very flat potential at larger field values that is suitable for inflation , but @xmath0 correction destroys the flatness of the potential .",
    "therefore , it must be strongly suppressed for the successful inflation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the quantitative constraint on the @xmath0 corrections to the starobinsky model in supergravity in light of the observational result and the possibility of its realization .",
    "even if the scalaron potential admits an inflationary solution , it is nontrivial whether it generates the primordial perturbations consistent with the current observation . as a result",
    ", we find severe constraints on the amplitude of the @xmath0 term .",
    "moreover , it is also nontrivial how severe tuning for the initial condition is required , since the regions for successful inflation in the field space are drastically limited .",
    "we find that the coupling of the @xmath0 term is very severely constrained if we start from the chaotic initial condition @xcite .",
    "however , we also find that if the scalaron potential vanishes at the larger field values , depending on the sign of the coupling of the @xmath0 corrections , topological inflation @xcite would be possible .",
    "therefore , the initial condition problem is solved in this case , and we should only focus on the observational constraint for the embedding of the starobinsky model in a supersymmetric theory . here , we take the old - minimal supergravity for concreteness , but the same result is obtained in other supersymmetric extensions such as the new - minimal supergravity , too , as far as the form of the scalaron potential is concerned after all the other degrees of freedom have been stabilized .",

    "[ app2 ] , we examine it in detail .",

    "therefore we conclude that the amplitude of the parameter @xmath129 must be smaller than at least @xmath136 to explain the current universe in the context of the supergravity starobinsky model .",
    "this means that some symmetries or mechanisms to reduce the higher - order corrections to the starobinsky model up to this level are necessary to derive it from the physics in the higher energy scales .    here",
    ", we explain the behaviors of the parameter dependence of the observables . in the case with @xmath96 , larger @xmath137 leads to larger values of @xmath114 during inflation .",
    "therefore , larger potential energy or smaller @xmath122 is required to generate the correct amplitude of the scalar perturbations @xmath116 , which leads to relatively large values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 . at the same time , the slow - roll parameter @xmath138 becomes a larger or even positive value , which leads to a larger value of the scalar spectral index @xmath117 . on the other hand , in the case with @xmath103 ,",
    "larger @xmath129 leads to smaller values of @xmath114 during inflation .",
    "this leads to larger values of @xmath122 to generate the correct amplitude of @xmath116 , which also means smaller values of @xmath8 . simultaneously , for larger @xmath129 , @xmath138 becomes larger , which leads to a smaller value of @xmath117 .",
    "note that the slow - roll parameters are independent of @xmath122 , and hence the observables @xmath117 and @xmath8 are @xmath122 independent .",
    "now , let us consider the initial condition problem , which is strikingly different depending on the sign of @xmath129 . first , for @xmath96 , as we have seen above , the field range that can evolve into the proper vacuum after inflation is limited to @xmath139 .",
    "for a sufficient amount of inflation , slow - roll inflation should start at @xmath140 .",
    "hence , severe fine - tuning of the initial condition at , say , the planckian epoch is necessary for both @xmath84 and @xmath141 .",
    "if @xmath141 has a planckian value @xmath142 initially , the scalar field amplitude varies @xmath143 before the slow - roll inflation phase sets in .",
    "therefore , @xmath144 must be larger than @xmath145 for this initial velocity , which turns to the constraint on @xmath129 as @xmath146 . for the larger amplitude of @xmath129 ,",
    "the initial velocity must be suppressed accordingly .    on the other hand , for @xmath103 , there is no restriction in the field range of @xmath84 , and the potential has a local maximum at @xmath147 .",
    "hence , if the universe starts with a chaotic initial condition , some domain falls into @xmath99 , and others run away to infinity . note",
    "that since the @xmath48 and @xmath92 fields are stabilized at the origin for any field values of @xmath84 we can take @xmath148 in all the domains",
    ". between these domains with different fates exists a region trapped to the potential maximum at @xmath149 , namely , a domain wall . as vilenkin and linde have pointed out @xcite , inflation can naturally take place inside the domain wall , where the large energy density distributes relatively homogeneously , if its thickness is larger than the local hubble radius .",
    "this is so - called the `` topological inflation . ''",
    "thus , in the present case , it may be possible for the topological inflation to take place .",
    "let us study this possibility in detail .",
    "the condition for the realization of topological inflation is numerically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case with a potential @xmath150 , and it was concluded that a domain wall triggers inflation if @xmath151 is larger than the critical value @xmath152 regardless of the value of @xmath153 . since the potential we are studying is different from the double - well type , the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite can not be applied directly .",
    "however , it is plausible that inflation can take place from the domain wall in the following reasons .",
    "the thickness of the domain wall can be evaluated as @xmath154 .",
    "since numerically we find that @xmath155 and the hubble parameter is evaluated as @xmath156 , we have the relation @xmath157 since the condition for the critical ratio between the wall thickness to the hubble length given in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath158 , the one in our case for @xmath159 is much larger than the critical value .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the shape of potential and its second derivative both in the case with our potential with @xmath160 and the double - well potential with @xmath161 , both of which have the same potential maximum .",
    "we can see that our potential is flatter than the double - well potential that can trigger the topological inflation .",
    "therefore , topological inflation will naturally take place in our potential satisfying the observational constraint @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath2 inflation is one of the most attractive inflation models in light of the planck result .",
    "however , the mechanism to induce the correct @xmath2 term that explains the observational result is not known .",
    "therefore , it would be a good direction to embed it in a supersymmetric theory because it is one of the most promising physics beyond the standard model and would be the key to the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "on the other hand , once we consider the supersymmetric theory of the @xmath2 model , higher - order terms can not be forbidden by symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the starobinsky model in the old - minimal supergravity with an @xmath0 correction that is free from ghost degrees of freedom . after confirming that fields other than the scalaron field",
    "are stabilized appropriately , we focused on the dynamics of the scalaron sector .",
    "since the @xmath0 correction easily violates the flatness of the inflaton potential in the scalaron picture , it should be strongly constrained .",
    "we find that the constraint on the @xmath0 term is not so strong just for the accelerating expansion of the universe , but in order to generate the spectral index of primordial scalar perturbation that is consistent with planck result , it is strongly constrained .",
    "it is found that in terms of dimensionless coupling constant @xmath163 it is constrained as @xmath164    on the initial condition , we also find the difficulties in the realization of inflation when there is an @xmath0 correction . from the chaotic initial condition in which the universe starts from the planck scale , the @xmath0 term must be very severely constrained for @xmath96 , where the scalaron potential jumps up at the field value larger than the value at which the @xmath0 correction becomes dominant . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of @xmath103 , the shape of the scalaron potential is hilltop type , and domain walls are generated somewhere in the universe regardless of the initial condition .",
    "we find that the domain wall is thick enough for the topological inflation for @xmath159 , and hence we do not suffer from the initial condition problem in this case . in summary , for the reasonable initial conditions , the @xmath0 correction is constrained as @xmath165 for the realization of inflation that leads to the present universe .",

    "<S> we consider the ghost - free higher - order corrections to the starobinsky model in the old - minimal supergravity , focusing on a sector among several scalar fields in the model that reproduces the scalaron potential in the original starobinsky model . in general , higher - order corrections can not be forbidden by symmetries , which likely violate the flatness of the scalaron potential and make inflation difficult in explaining the present universe . </S>",
    "<S> we find a severe constraint on the dimensionless coupling of the @xmath0 correction as @xmath1 from the recent results of the planck observation . </S>",
    "<S> if we start from the chaotic initial condition , the constraint becomes much more severe . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case in which the coupling of the @xmath0 correction is positive , the scalaron potential has a local maximum with two local minima at the origin and infinity , which admits topological inflation . in this case </S>",
