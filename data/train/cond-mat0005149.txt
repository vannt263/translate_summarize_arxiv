    "for the past twenty years or so , the dynamics of liquid metals has been a field of intense research , both theoretical and experimental ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , especially as regards the liquid alkali metals , all of which have been studied experimentally by means of inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) or inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) or by both techniques : li,@xcite na,@xcite k,@xcite rb,@xcite and cs.@xcite molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have also stimulated this progress because of their ability to determine certain time correlation functions which are not accessible to experiment , and thereby they supplement the information obtained from the experiments .",
    "most such md studies have likewise been performed for alkali metals,@xcite although other systems such as the liquid alkaline - earths @xcite and liquid lead @xcite have also been studied .    on the theoretical side",
    ", this progress can be linked to the development of microscopic theories which provide a better understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying the dynamics of simple liquids.@xcite an important advance in this respect was the observation that the decay of several time - dependent properties can be explained by the interplay of two different dynamical processes.@xcite the first one , which gives rise to a rapid initial decay , comprises fast , uncorrelated , short - range interactions ( collisional events ) which can be broadly identified with `` binary '' collisions . the second process , which leads to a long - time tail , is connected to the non - linear coupling of the dynamical property of interest with slowly varying collective variables ( `` modes '' ) such as density fluctuations , currents , etc . , and is therefore referred to as a mode - coupling process .    by introducing some simplifying approximations , sjgren and coworkers",
    "@xcite first applied this theory to evaluate several collective and single - particle dynamical properties of liquid rubidium as well as the single - particle properties of liquid argon , at thermodynamic conditions near their respective triple points , obtaining results in qualitative agreement with the corresponding md simulations .",
    "balucani and coworkers @xcite also applied a simplified mode - coupling theoretical approach to study the liquid alkali metals close to their triple points , obtaining good qualitative predictions for several transport properties ( self - diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity ) as well as other single - particle dynamical properties ( velocity autocorrelation function and its memory function , and mean square displacement ) . based on these ideas , we developed a theoretical approach @xcite which allows a self - consistent calculation of all the above transport and single - particle dynamical properties ; its application to liquid lithium @xcite and the liquid alkaline - earths @xcite near their triple points , has lead to theoretical results in fair agreement with both simulations and experiment .    since single - particle and collective dynamical properties",
    "are closely interwoven within the mode - coupling theory , the application of this formalism to any liquid system should imply the self - consistent solution of the coupled equations appearing in the theory .",
    "however , none of the above - mentioned theoretical calculations have been performed in this way .",
    "in fact , the usual practice is to obtain the input dynamical quantities needed for the evaluation of the mode - coupling expressions either from md simulations or from some other theoretical approximation . in particular , this has often been the case for the intermediate scattering function , @xmath0 , which has been obtained either from md simulations,@xcite or derived from some simple approximation such as the viscoelastic model or some simplification of it.@xcite    we have recently presented a theoretical scheme @xcite for the self - consistent determination of @xmath1 within the mode - coupling theory . its application to study the dynamical properties of liquid lithium at thermodynamic states near the triple point lead to good qualitative results in comparison with md simulations",
    ". however , the self - intermediate scattering function , @xmath2 , was evaluated by means of the gaussian approximation , leading to an unsymmetric treatment of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , because mode coupling effects were included for the first but not for the latter .",
    "this imbalance is corrected in the present paper , in which we introduce a self - consistent framework which treats on an equal footing , and within the mode coupling theory , both @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this new scheme is then applied to study the dynamical properties of liquid lithium , covering a somewhat larger range of temperatures than in our previous study .",
    "the only input data required by the theory are the interatomic pair potential , which was obtained from the neutral pseudoatom ( npa ) @xcite method , and the liquid static structural functions , which were evaluated through the variational modified hypernetted chain approximation ( vmhnc ) @xcite theory of liquids .",
    "comparison with md simulations @xcite has shown that this combination leads to an accurate description of the equilibrium properties of liquid lithium close to the triple point .",
    "we stress that by combining the npa method to obtain the interatomic pair potential , and the vmhnc to calculate the liquid static structure , we are able to attain the required input data , for the calculation of the dynamical properties , from the only knowledge of the atomic number of the system and its thermodynamic state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] we describe the theory used for the calculation of the dynamical properties of the system and we propose a self - consistent scheme for the evaluation of both single - particle and collective properties . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the results obtained when this theory is applied to liquid lithium at some thermodynamic states .",
    "finally we sum up and discuss our results .",
    "this study is based on a combination of kinetic theory ideas with the mori memory function approach.@xcite within this framework , it is assumed that the memory functions of several time correlation functions are controlled by the interplay of two different dynamical processes : one , with a rapid initial decay , due to fast , uncorrelated short - range interactions ; the second ( known as a mode - coupling process ) , with a long - time tail , due to the non - linear coupling of the specific time correlation function with slowly varying collective variables ( `` modes '' ) such as density fluctuations , currents , etc . in the present theoretical framework",
    ", we focus on two basic dynamical variables , namely , the intermediate and the self - intermediate scattering functions which provide information about the collective and single - particle dynamical properties of the system , respectively . moreover , their respective time - fourier transforms give the dynamic and self - dynamic structure factors which are amenable of determination by means of both ins and ixs experiments .",
    "the collective dynamical properties are embodied in the dynamic structure factor , @xmath3 , which can be obtained as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 stands for the real part and @xmath6 is the laplace transform of the intermediate scattering function , @xmath0 , i.e. ,    @xmath7    within the memory function formalism , @xmath8 can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath9^{-1 } \\",

    "note that since we consider spherically symmetric potentials and homogenous systems , the dynamical magnitudes only depend on the modulus @xmath16 .",
    "now , the second - order memory function @xmath11 is decomposed as follows:@xcite    @xmath17    where the term @xmath18 , known as the binary part , has a fast decay , whereas the the mode - coupling contribution , @xmath19 , which aims to take into account repeated correlated collisions , starts as @xmath20 , reaches a maximum and then decays rather slowly .",
    "we now briefly describe both terms ; for more details we refer the reader to ref . .",
    "over very short times , the memory function is well described by @xmath18 alone , both @xmath11 and @xmath18 having the same initial value and curvature:@xcite    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    is the squared einstein frequency and    @xmath23    with @xmath24 and @xmath25 denoting respectively the interatomic pair potential and the pair distribution function of the liquid system with number density @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the binary term includes all the contributions to @xmath11 to order @xmath28 .",
    "since the detailed features of the `` binary '' dynamics of systems with continuous interatomic potentials are rather poorly known , we resort to a semi - phenomenological approximation that reproduces the correct short - time expansion . therefore we write @xcite    @xmath29    where the relaxation time , @xmath30 , can be determined from a short - time expansion of the formally exact expression of the binary term , and is related to the exact sixth frequency moment of @xmath3 .",

    "a detailed treatment of this term requires consideration of several modes ( density - density coupling , density - longitudinal current coupling and density - transversal current coupling ) .",
    "however , for thermodynamic conditions near the triple point , the most important contribution is the density - density term , which can be written as @xcite    @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\left[f ( \\mid \\vec{k } - \\vec{k^{\\prime } } \\mid , t ) \\ ,   f(k^{\\prime } , t ) -   f_b(\\mid \\vec{k } - \\vec{k^{\\prime } } \\mid , t ) \\ , f_b(k^{\\prime } , t)\\right ] \\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the direct correlation function and @xmath36 denotes the binary part of the intermediate scattering function , @xmath37 . following sjgren,@xcite we approximate the ratio between @xmath0 and its binary part by the ratio between their corresponding self counterparts , i.e. ,    @xmath38    where @xmath2 is the self - intermediate scattering function and @xmath39 stands for its binary part , which is now approximated by the free - particle expression    @xmath40 \\ , .\\ ] ]    once @xmath2 has been specified , the self - consistent evaluation of the above formalism will yield to @xmath1 , and , therefore to all the collective dynamical properties discussed so far .      in this work",

    "its frequency spectrum is the self - dynamic structure factor , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 stands for the laplace transform , which according to the memory function formalism , can be expressed as    @xmath46^{-1 } \\,=    \\left [ z + \\frac{\\omega_s^2(k)}{z + \\tilde{\\gamma}_s(k , z)}\\right]^{-1 } \\",

    "therefore the possible errors introduced by making specific approximations for these binary terms become negligible in the region of intermediate and long times , where the dominant contribution to @xmath64 is the product @xmath65 .",
    "a viscoelastic model has also been proposed for the @xmath2 ; it assumes for @xmath52 an exponentially decaying function with a single relaxation time , which can in principle be fixed using several prescriptions that have been proposed .",
    "in this work we will use the expression obtained bu requiring that @xmath66 coincides for @xmath42 with the exact free - particle result.@xcite    a different , more accurate and widely used , model for @xmath2 is the so - called gaussian approximation ( ga ) :    @xmath67   % f_s(k , t)= exp \\left [ -   \\left ( \\frac{k^2}{m \\beta } \\right )   % \\int_0^t \\ ; d\\tau \\ ; ( t- \\tau ) z(\\tau ) \\right ]   \\,\\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ]    where @xmath68 stands for the mean squared displacement of a tagged particle in the fluid .",

    "now , with the new estimates for both @xmath0 and @xmath2 the whole procedure is repeated .",
    "the previous computational loop is iterated until self - consistency is achieved between the initial and final @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the practical application of this scheme has shown that reaching self - consistency requires about ten iterations .",

    "it is interesting to mention that although the @xmath138 does not exhibit the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath132 , however the corresponding second - order memory function , @xmath115 does have a tail which fairly follows the intermediate and long time behaviour displayed by @xmath140 , as is observed in figs .",

    "[ 2memfskt470 ] for t = 470 k , where we have focused on the intermediate and long time behaviour , and the comparison is also performed with the md simulations , the ga model and the present theoretical framework .",
    "note that whereas the ga model always underestimates the md results , the opposite happens with the present theoretical framework .",
    "the underestimation induced by the ga model is more marked for those @xmath88-values around the main peak of @xmath15 which is precisely the region where @xmath132 exhibits a minimum . in order to explain the conection between this behaviour and the shape of the corresponding @xmath150",

    "therefore , according to fig .",
    "[ 2memfskt470 ] , the ga model leads to a second order memory function , @xmath115 which underestimates the corresponding md results for all @xmath88-values , and by the previous relationship it leads to greater estimates of the corresponding @xmath129 , when compared with the corresponding md results .",
    "by contrast , the opposite behaviour is exhibited by the present theoretical formalism as it overestimates the corresponding @xmath52 and therefore leads to smaller values of the corresponding @xmath129 .",

    "( [ gammasb ] ) .",
    "the positions of the maxima and minima of @xmath155 are also well predicted , although the amplitude of the oscillations is underestimated .",
    "the corresponding self - diffusion coefficients , @xmath73 , are shown in table [ diffu ] along with those obtained by the md simulations .",
    "for all the temperatures considered the md results agree rather well with the experimental ins @xcite and tracer data @xcite ( for t = 843 k the experimental data have been extrapolated slightly outside the range suggested in refs . and ) .",
    "this good agreement supports the adequacy of the npa - derived interatomic pair potentials to describe liquid lithium in this temperature range .",
    "the theoretical results show good agreement with the md values for t=470 k , whereas as the temperature is increased the md results are underestimated .",
    "in fact , according to the relation between @xmath73 and the vacf , see eq .",
    "( [ difz ] ) , the smaller values obtained for @xmath73 are a consequence of the above mentioned underestimation for the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath155 , especially that of the first maximum .",
    "this is more evident at t=725 k , whereas for t = 470 k there is a cancellation between the first minimum and the first maximum leading to a theoretical @xmath73 very close to the md result .    as regards the shear viscosity , fig .",
    "[ sheartot ] shows , for t=470 and 725 k , the md results obtained for the sacf along with its three contributions .",
    "note that @xmath79 and @xmath77 parts of the sacf are very small ( less than @xmath156 of the potential - potential part ) which justifies their being ignored in the theoretical calculations of the sacf .",
    "the figure also shows the theoretical @xmath76 along with its binary and mode - coupling components . note",
    "that whereas for the lower temperature the inclusion of the mode - coupling component is essential for achieving a good overall agreement with the md data , when the temperature is increased the role of the binary part becomes more dominant ; in fact , for 725 k the binary part alone accounts for most of the md results .",
    "our present theoretical results slightly overestimate the short time ( @xmath157 ps ) behaviour of @xmath76 and this is mainly due to the binary component ; more explicitly , it comes from the overestimation of the values for @xmath84 .",
    "this limitation can be traced back to the use of the superposition approximation in the evaluation of the three - body term appearing in @xmath84 , which has a rather important weight in the final value.@xcite    on the other hand , the behaviour for @xmath158 , which is completely determined by the mode - coupling component , is rather well described for both temperatures .",
    "the values obtained for the shear viscosity coefficient , @xmath75 , are presented in table [ visco ] .",
    "although the theoretical values slightly overestimate the md ones ( because of the short time behaviour of @xmath76 ) , both the theoretical and the md results agree well with the experimental values.@xcite",
    "in this work we have evaluated several dynamical properties of liquid lithium at thermodynamic states close to the triple point .",
    "the calculations were performed by a self - consistent theoretical framework which , by incorporating mode - coupling concepts , allows the evaluation of both single - particle properties , as represented by the self - intermediate scattering function , its memory functions , the velocity autocorrelation function and the self - diffusion coefficient , as well as collective properties such as the intermediate scattering function , its memory functions , the autocorrelation function of the non - diagonal elements of the stress tensor , and the shear viscosity coefficient .",
    "its application to liquid lithium has led to reasonable results when compared with both the corresponding md results and the available experimental data .",
    "the agreement is particularly satisfactory near the melting point , deteriorating somewhat at higher temperatures .    within the present theoretical formalism",
    ", memory functions play a key role , specifically the second order memory function of both the intermediate scattering function and its self counterpart , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ mff ] ) and ( [ mffs ] ) .",
    "all the relaxation mechanisms controlling the collective and single - particle dynamics , are introduced at the level of the corresponding second order memory functions which are decomposed into their binary and mode - coupling contributions .",
    "we have found that the gaussian ansatz adopted for the binary term provides a reasonable description of the corresponding md results for short times . as for the other contribution , namely the mode coupling part , for simplicity",
    "we have only considered the density - density coupling term .",
    "although other couplings could be included , this term provides the dominant mode coupling contribution for thermodynamic states close to the triple point , which explains why both @xmath11 and @xmath52 are better described for the lower temperatures .",
    "the self - consistent theoretical calculations provide results for @xmath95 and @xmath1 in qualitative agreement with the md results , and much more accurate than other theoretical approaches , as for example the widely used viscoelastic model .",
    "better results have been achieved for @xmath52 and the corresponding @xmath2 . within this context",
    ", we emphasize the good description of the wavevector dependence of both the peak height and the half - width at half maximum of the @xmath59 , as represented by @xmath137 and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "since these funcitons constitute a stringent test of any theoretical model,@xcite we conclude that the main physical effects behind @xmath2 seem to be included in the present theoretical framework , specifically , in the expression adopted for @xmath111 .",
    "we stress that , to our knowledge , this is the first theoretical study where the behaviour of @xmath141 has been qualitatively reproduced from just its memory function / mode - coupling formalism , without resorting to parameters , fitting to an assumed shape or including magnitudes from md simulations in the evaluation of @xmath2 .",
    "the calculations carried out for the @xmath52 have confirmed that the existence of a tail is necessary to account for the oscillatory behaviour of @xmath130 ; however , the magnitude of the tail , understood in the sense of its time integral , has a most important influence on the amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , the results obtained for the ga model with and without non - gaussian corrections , point towards the existence of a minimum magnitude of the tail in order to induce an oscillatory behaviour on @xmath130 .    the improvements achieved in the description of @xmath2 and related magnitudes , when compared with those predicted by the ga model,@xcite are not fully reflected in the obtained values for the self - diffusion coefficients",
    ". however , this is not surprising because they are defined as a time integral of a correlation function which gives a measure of its time average but provides very scarce information on the dynamics of the system .",
    "we end up by signaling some limitations of the formalism presented here .",
    "first , its density / temperature range of applicability lies within the region where the relevant slow relaxation channel is provided by the coupling to density fluctuations , and this ceases to be valid for densities smaller than those typical of the melting point . for these densities , coupling to other modes , like longitudinal and/or transverse currents , becomes increasingly important and we believe that this is the main reason for the small deviations observed in the vacf total memory function at the two higher temperatures studied .",
    "in fact , further improvements in the description of the @xmath2 and @xmath0 , at all temperatures , would also require the inclusion of other modes in the corresponding second - order memory function .",
    "moreover , although the previous remarks concern the mode - coupling contribution of the second order memory function , attention should also be drawn to the binary term .",
    "in fact , this term is poorly known and its role becomes increasingly dominant with large @xmath88 and/or at increasing temperatures when the mode - coupling contribution decreases",
    ". a first task would be to study the influence of the superposition approximation for the three particle distribution function , on the obtained results for the relaxation times @xmath30 and @xmath58 .",
    "further work is currently performed in that direction , and the results will be reported in due time .",
