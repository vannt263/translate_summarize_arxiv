    "a lot of progress has been made in understanding the robustness of solar model predictions since neutrino 96  @xcite . in this talk",
    ", i will first summarize the new ingredients and then give the current best - estimates .",
    "then i will discuss the uncertainties in the predictions .",
    "many of the results given here are adopted from the recent bp98 paper  @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ best ] , there is excellent agreement between standard solar models calculated by different groups with different codes .",
    "if you want to obtain the numerical data that are discussed in this talk , you can copy them from my web site : http://www.sns.ias.edu/@xmath0jnb .",
    "in this section , i will first summarize the new and relevant results on nuclear fusion reactions and on the screening of nuclear reactions and then summarize the situation with respect to neutrino cross sections . finally , i will mention a few miscellaneous improvements that have been made since neutrino 96 .      in january , 1997",
    ", the institute for nuclear theory ( int ) hosted a workshop devoted to determining the best estimates and the uncertainties in the most important solar fusion reactions .",
    "thirty - nine experts in low energy nuclear experiments and theory , representing many different research groups and points of view , participated in the workshop and evaluated the existing experimental data and theoretical calculations .",
    "their conclusions have been summarized in a detailed article authored jointly by the participants and published by the reviews of modern physics @xcite . in general outline ,",
    "the conclusions of the int workshop paper confirmed and strengthened previous standard analyses of nuclear fusion rates , although in a few important cases ( for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 reactions ) the estimated uncertainties were determined to be larger than previously believed .",
    "the largest change from what was used in the results presented at neutrino 96 is the lower @xmath4 cross section adopted by adelberger et al .",
    "previously , most authors constructing standard solar models used the caltech ( cit ) value for the @xmath5b production cross section @xcite .",
    "the difference between the int and the cit estimates of the @xmath5b production cross section is due almost entirely to the decision by the int group to base their estimate on only one ( the best documented ) of the six experiments analyzed by the cit collaboration .    as we go alone",
    ", i will indicate how the principal predictions of solar models depend upon the assumed @xmath5b production cross section .      in one respect ,",
    "the calculation of neutrino fluxes has simplified from neutrino 96 to neutrino 98 .",
    "the rather complicated expressions in the literature for the screening of nuclear fusion reactions by electrons and ions have been replaced by a simple analytic expression that was originally derived by salpeter  @xcite for the case of `` weak screening '' only .",
    "gruzinov and bahcall  @xcite employed a mean field formalism to calculate the electron density of the screening cloud using the appropriate density matrix equation of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "because of well understood physical effects that are included for the first time in this treatment , the calculated enhancement of reaction rates does not agree with the frequently used interpolation formulae .",
    "for the sun , screening effects cause only small uncertainties in the predicted neutrino fluxes if the appropriate salpeter formula is used .      improved cross sections for neutrino absorption by gallium and by chlorine are now available as well as somewhat more precise standard ( undistorted ) neutrino energy spectra .",
    "i summarize the results here .",
    "a number of authors do not use the best available data for the neutrino cross sections and energy spectra and some authors even give event rates ( or snu values ) but do not say which cross sections and energy spectra they use so that one can not interpret their results precisely .",
    "i have calculated  @xcite neutrino absorption cross sections for @xmath6 for all solar neutrino sources with standard energy spectra , and for laboratory sources of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; the calculations including , where appropriate , the thermal energy of fusing solar ions and use improved nuclear and atomic data .",
    "the ratio , @xmath9 , of measured ( in gallex and sage ) to calculated @xmath10 capture rate is @xmath11 and was discussed extensively at neutrino 98 by gavrin and by kirsten .",
    "i also calculated cross sections for specific neutrino energies chosen so that a spline fit determines accurately the event rates in a gallium detector even if new physics changes the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos . in order to make possible more precise analyses of event rates for neutrino scenarios which change the shape of the neutrino energy spectra from individual neutrino sources , i evaluated and presented , for the first time , theoretical uncertainties for absorption cross sections at specific energies , as well as for the standard ( undistorted ) neutrino energy spectra . also for use by people doing neutrino oscillation calculations , i calculated standard energy spectra for pp and cno neutrino sources and presented the results in appendices and on my web site",
    "i note in passing that neutrino fluxes predicted by standard solar models , corrected for diffusion , have been in the range @xmath12 snu to @xmath13 snu since 1968  @xcite .",
    "a group of us have recently redetermined the standard shape for the @xmath5b neutrino energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the available data all seem to be consistent with each other within rather small uncertainties , so we were able to determine not only a best - fit energy spectrum but also two extreme spectra that are different by what we estimate is effectively @xmath14 .",
    "the uncertainties include estimates of the radiative and forbidden corrections .",
    "this improved spectrum yields a slightly different @xmath5b absorption cross section  @xcite .",
    "i am somewhat nervous about the standard ( undistorted ) @xmath5be neutrino energy spectrum since it does depend upon rather old data  @xcite",
    ". it would be very good if the @xmath15-particle energy spectrum from @xmath5be decay could be remeasured accurately in a new laboratory experiment .",
    "the situation for neutrino - electron scattering is good ; cross sections are available  @xcite that include electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "the standard solar model , bp98 , that is discussed in this report includes somewhat improved radiative opacities calculated by the livermore national laboratory group , the so - called opal96 opacities  @xcite , and the improved opal equation of state @xcite .",
    "one improvement that i am rather proud of is new publicly available software that i have made available on my web site ( under neutrino software and data ) is a program to calculate solar neutrino rates and uncertainties .",
    "the problem of calculating the uncertainties in the predicted fluxes is somewhat complicated , especially since the uncertainties are asymmetric for some of the important input parameters .",
    "i decided to make this software publicly available ( and therefore polished it significantly ) so that people could see explicitly what uncertainties were included for each parameter and how the uncertainties were combined .",
    "i have also polished my nuclear energy generation code .",
    "the changes made in this code , although they probably took me altogether a few weeks of programming and debugging time , ended up not changing neutrino flux predictions by more than a percent .",
    "table  1 gives the neutrino fluxes and their uncertainties for our best standard solar model , hereafter bp98 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the solar model makes use of the int nuclear reaction rates , recent ( 1996 ) livermore opal radiative opacities , the opal equation of state , and electron and ion screening as determined by the recent density matrix calculation .",

    "this agreement demonstrates the robustness of the predictions since the calculations use different computer codes ( which achieve varying degrees of precision ) and involve a variety of choices for the nuclear parameters , the equation of state , the stellar radiative opacity , the initial heavy element abundances , and the physical processes that are included .",
    "the largest contributions to the dispersion in values in figure  [ fig : independent ] are due to the choice of the normalization for @xmath36 ( the production cross - section factor for @xmath21 neutrinos ) and the inclusion , or non - inclusion , of element diffusion in the stellar evolution codes .",

    "[ fig : independent ] now all include helium and heavy element diffusion . by comparing a large number of earlier models",
    ", it was shown that all published standard solar models give the same results for solar neutrino fluxes to an accuracy of better than 10% if the same input parameters and physical processes are included  @xcite .",

    "bahcall , krastev , and smirnov  @xcite have compared the observed rates with the calculated , standard model values , combining quadratically the theoretical solar model and experimental uncertainties , as well as the uncertainties in the neutrino cross sections .",
    "since the gallex and sage experiments measure the same quantity , we treat the weighted average rate in gallium as one experimental number .",
    "we adopt the superkamiokande measurement as the most precise direct determination of the higher - energy @xmath21 neutrino flux .    using the predicted fluxes from the bp98 model ,",

    "in this section , i will first discuss the formal uncertainties in the solar model flux calculations and then review the strong constraints that helioseismology places on perturbations of the standard solar model .",
    "table  2 summarizes the uncertainties in the most important solar neutrino fluxes and in the cl and ga event rates due to different nuclear fusion reactions ( the first four entries ) , the heavy element to hydrogen mass ratio ( z / x ) , the radiative opacity , the solar luminosity , the assumed solar age , and the helium and heavy element diffusion coefficients .",
    "the @xmath56 reaction causes a 0.2% uncertainty in the predicted pp flux and a 0.1 snu uncertainty in the cl ( ga ) event rates .    the predicted event rates for the chlorine and gallium experiments use recent improved calculations of neutrino absorption cross sections @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the prediction for the gallium rate is dominated by uncertainties in the neutrino absorption cross sections , @xmath57 snu ( @xmath58% of the predicted rate ) and @xmath59 snu ( @xmath60% of the predicted rate ) .",

    "-.4 in    the nuclear fusion uncertainties in table  2 were taken from adelberger et al .",
    "@xcite , the neutrino cross section uncertainties from @xcite , the heavy element uncertainty was taken from helioseismological measurements @xcite , the luminosity and age uncertainties were adopted from bp95 @xcite , the @xmath62 fractional uncertainty in the diffusion rate was taken to be @xmath63% @xcite , which is supported by helioseismological evidence @xcite , and the opacity uncertainty was determined by comparing the results of fluxes computed using the older los alamos opacities with fluxes computed using the modern livermore opacities @xcite . to include the effects of asymmetric errors , the now public - available code for calculating rates and uncertainties ( see discussion in previous section )",
    "was run with different input uncertainties and the results averaged .",
    "the software contains a description of how each of the uncertainties listed in table  2 were determined and used .",
    "the low energy cross section of the @xmath64 reaction is the most important quantity that must be determined more accurately in order to decrease the error in the predicted event rates in solar neutrino experiments . the @xmath5b neutrino flux that is measured by the kamiokande @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , and sno @xcite experiments is , in all standard solar model calculations , directly proportional to the @xmath64 cross section .",
    "if the @xmath62 uncertainty in this cross section can be reduced by a factor of two to 5% , then it will no longer be the limiting uncertainty in predicting the crucial @xmath5b neutrino flux ( cf .",
    "table  2 ) .",
    "could the solar model calculations be wrong by enough to explain the discrepancies between predictions and measurements for solar neutrino experiments ?",
    "helioseismology , which confirms predictions of the standard solar model to high precision , suggests that the answer is probably `` no . ''",
    "figure  [ modelsunnu ] shows the fractional differences between the most accurate available sound speeds measured by helioseismology @xcite and sound speeds calculated with our best solar model ( with no free parameters ) .",
    "the horizontal line corresponds to the hypothetical case in which the model predictions exactly match the observed values .",
    "the rms fractional difference between the calculated and the measured sound speeds is @xmath65 for the entire region over which the sound speeds are measured , @xmath66 . in the solar core , @xmath67 ( in which about @xmath68% of the solar energy and neutrino flux is produced in a standard model )",
    ", the rms fractional difference between measured and calculated sound speeds is @xmath69 .",
    "helioseismological measurements also determine two other parameters that help characterize the outer part of the sun ( far from the inner region in which neutrinos are produced ) : the depth of the solar convective zone ( cz ) , the region in the outer part of the sun that is fully convective , and the present - day surface abundance by mass of helium ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the measured values , @xmath71 @xcite , and @xmath72 @xcite , are in satisfactory agreement with the values predicted by the solar model bp98 , namely , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "however , we shall see below that precision measurements of the sound speed near the transition between the radiative interior ( in which energy is transported by radiation ) and the outer convective zone ( in which energy is transported by convection ) reveal small discrepancies between the model predictions and the observations in this region .",
    "if solar physics were responsible for the solar neutrino problems , how large would one expect the discrepancies to be between solar model predictions and helioseismological observations ?",
    "the characteristic size of the discrepancies can be estimated using the results of the neutrino experiments and scaling laws for neutrino fluxes and sound speeds .",
    "all recently published solar models predict essentially the same fluxes from the fundamental pp and pep reactions ( amounting to @xmath75 snu in gallium experiments , cf .  table  1 ) , which are closely related to the solar luminosity . comparing the measured gallium rates ( reported at neutrino 98 ) and the standard predicted rate for the gallium experiments , the @xmath76be flux must be reduced by a factor @xmath77 if the disagreement is not to exceed @xmath78 standard deviations , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy @xmath79 . for a @xmath80 ( @xmath34 ) disagreement , @xmath81 .",
    "sound speeds scale like the square root of the local temperature divided by the mean molecular weight and the @xmath76be neutrino flux scales approximately as the @xmath33th power of the temperature @xcite .",
    "assuming that the temperature changes are dominant , agreement to within @xmath62 would require fractional changes of order @xmath82 in sound speeds ( @xmath34 could be reached with @xmath83 changes ) , if all model changes were in the temperature with the then available experimental numbers would require fractional changes of order @xmath84 in sound speeds ( @xmath34 could be reached with @xmath85 changes . ) ] .",
    "this argument is conservative because it ignores the contributions from the @xmath5b and cno neutrinos which contribute to the observed counting rate ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) and which , if included , would require an even larger reduction of the @xmath76be flux .",
    "i have chosen the vertical scale in fig .  1 to be appropriate for fractional differences between measured and predicted sound speeds that are of order @xmath83 to @xmath82 and that might therefore affect solar neutrino calculations .",
    "1 shows that the characteristic agreement between solar model predictions and helioseismological measurements is more than a factor of @xmath86 better than would be expected if there were a solar model explanation of the solar neutrino problems .",
    "three decades of refining the input data and the solar model calculations has led to a predicted standard model event rate for the chlorine experiment , @xmath87 snu , which is very close to the best - estimate value obtained in 1968 @xcite , which was @xmath88 snu .",
    "the situation regarding solar neutrinos is , however , completely different now , thirty years later .",
    "four experiments have confirmed the detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "helioseismological measurements show ( cf .",
    "1 ) that hypothetical deviations from the standard solar model that seem to be required by simple scaling laws to fit just the gallium solar neutrino results are at least a factor of @xmath89 larger than the rms disagreement between the standard solar model predictions and the helioseismological observations . this conclusion does not make use of the strong evidence which points in the same direction from the chlorine , kamiokande , and superkamiokande experiments .",
    "the improvement in helioseismological measurements over the past two years , from neutrino 96 to neutrino 98 ( cf .",
    "figure  2 of the neutrino  96 talk  @xcite with figure  [ modelsunnu ] of this talk ) , has resulted in a five - fold improvement in the agreement with the calculated standard solar model sound speeds and the measured solar velocities !",
    "i believe that this improved agreement is yet another reason to believe that standard solar models reliably predict solar neutrino fluxes .",
