    "in recent years the area of numerical analysis of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) has expanded at a fast pace .",
    "this interest has been driven by different application areas , such as computational finance , neuroscience or electrical circuit engineering .",
    "a large part of research in stochastic numerics has been aimed towards the development and strong and weak convergence analysis of several classes of numerical methods . a further important issue for the investigation of numerical methods consists of examining methods for their ability to preserve qualitative features of the continuous system they are developed to approximate .",
    "a linear stability analysis is usually the first step of an analysis in this direction . for this",
    "the method of interest is applied to a scalar linear test equation and stability conditions on method parameters and step - size are derived and compared with the stability condition for the test equation . in deterministic numerical analysis the underlying idea for a linear stability analysis is based on the following line of reasoning : one linearises and centres a nonlinear ordinary differential equation @xmath2 around an equilibrium , the resulting linear system @xmath3 ( @xmath4 the jacobian of @xmath5 evaluated at equilibrium ) is then diagonalised and the system thus decoupled , justifying the use of the scalar test equation @xmath6 , for the analysis .",
    "we refer to , for example ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv.2 ) for more detail on this procedure .",
    "in the stochastic case the same fundamental problem exists : we wish to preserve the qualitative behaviour of solutions of nonlinear stochastic differential equations following discretisation by a numerical method .",
    "once again the starting point is a linear stability analysis .",
    "we can linearise and centre a nonlinear sde around an equilibrium solution ( see  @xcite for the corresponding theory ) , and this procedure yields a system of sdes with an @xmath7-dimensional driving wiener process of the form @xmath8 research on stability analysis for sdes has focused on the scalar linear test equation @xmath9 , where its solution is called geometric brownian motion .",
    "this corresponds to considering the linearised sde system when it can be completely decoupled and with one driving wiener process .",
    "relevant references are given by , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "some first explorations of a linear stability analysis for systems of sdes have been made in  @xcite , and in  @xcite suitable linear test systems have been derived .",
    "the most common and well - known methods to treat sdes numerically are the euler - maruyama approximation and the milstein scheme developed in the last century .",
    "these methods and their drift - implicit counterparts have been studied for their stability behaviour , see for example  @xcite , however always only for a one - dimensional noise term in the test equation .",
    "our aim in this article is to investigate the influence of multi - dimensional noise on the mean - square stability behaviour of these numerical methods and to compare their stability behaviour . assuming that the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be diagonalised and the system above decoupled , we propose a scalar linear equation with an @xmath7-dimensional wiener process , that is @xmath12 , as a suitable test equation .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-maruyama and the @xmath0-milstein method and study the asymptotic mean - square stability properties of these methods .",
    "we find that the stability conditions for the @xmath0-milstein method are not only stronger than those for the @xmath0-maruyama method , but they also become more restrictive when increasing the number of noise terms in the sde . in particular",
    "we find it impossible to conclude @xmath4-stability for the @xmath0-milstein method , in the sense that we can not define a value or bound @xmath13 for the parameter @xmath0 , such that the method applied to the test equation would be @xmath4-stable for all @xmath14 _ for all @xmath15 and all parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17_. this indicates that analysing the stability behaviour of numerical methods using test equations with only a one - dimensional wiener process may not provide sufficient insight into the properties of the methods for practical high - dimensional application problems .",
    "we then present a modification of the @xmath0-milstein method , where we introduce partial implicitness involving a further parameter @xmath1 in the hope to have a better control on the stability behaviour of the method .",
    "the stability analysis indicates that this is the case , although the stability condition still depends on the number of noise terms .",

    "the analytical results in the previous sections also suggest choices of step - sizes , such that the zero solution of any one of the numerical methods for a fixed set of parameters is asymptotically mean - square stable and obviously it is possible to illustrate this by performing numerical experiments with fixed parameter sets and varying the step - size @xmath51 .",
    "however , the focus of this article is rather on comparing qualitative properties of _ methods _ than on how individual methods behave for various step - sizes .",
    "each of the four figures below consists of three pictures .",
    "the underlying idea of a stability analysis of numerical methods is to provide guidance for choosing method parameters and a step - size such that the numerical solution represents a good approximation of the true solution .",
    "( note that convergence of a method only guarantees this in the limit for @xmath217 . )",
    "thus , we plot in the left picture of each figure the mean - square error @xmath218 between the exact solution @xmath219 and numerical solution @xmath220 for the corresponding method and choice of method parameters .",
    "this allows to compare the impact of the choice of method on actually computing solutions of sdes .",
    "however , the quantity of interest in the stability definitions [ d.stabil ] and [ d.stabildiff ] are the second moments of the analytical and numerical solutions . therefore the other two pictures present plots of the second moments of the solutions of , , and , in the middle picture estimated from the numerical simulations of , and , in the right picture computed form the analytical solutions .",
    "this allows to compare the effect of the choice of method and parameters on the behaviour of the second moments analytically and also , how well this is approximated by the numerical methods .    in detail , the figures present the following quantities , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 denote the values on grid points of a trajectory of the explicit solution of with the above parameters and of the numerical trajectory produced by one of the methods , respectively : @xmath223 { \\mathsf{e}}(x_i^2 ) & = & s^i \\cdot x_0 ^ 2 \\quad \\text { for all } i \\ , .",
    "\\label{numsecmom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression for @xmath224 represents an estimator for the second moment of the numerical approximation , the expression for @xmath225 is the solution of the deterministic ode @xmath226 ( see proof of lemma  [ l.contprob ] ) at discrete time - points and the last expression for @xmath227 is the result of applying the recurrences , and where @xmath228 denotes the factor in front of @xmath227 in the right - hand side of the corresponding recurrence equation .",
    "the number of trajectories computed for the above quantities is @xmath229 for each simulation .",
    "figures  [ fig.stabresa ] to  [ fig.stabrese ] illustrate the behaviour of the methods for the above set of parameters , in particular the same fixed step - size @xmath155 and different choices of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0-maruyama method provides reliable approximations for @xmath230 , but not for @xmath163 , the @xmath0-milstein method in same setting _ does not _ provide reliable approximations for @xmath163 and @xmath231 .",
    "in fact , the numerical solutions for @xmath231 in this setting diverge .",
    "we can observe the improvement in the stability behaviour when using the @xmath0-@xmath1-milstein method introduced in the previous section .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0-milstein method this method produces reliable approximations for the choice of @xmath232 when also setting @xmath201 .",
    "further , for the choice of @xmath233 the @xmath0-@xmath1-milstein approximation behaves satisfactorily for all values of @xmath0 , thus the implicit term in the diffusion approximation is effectively stabilising the method .",
    "a linear stability analysis has been performed for the @xmath0-maruyama method and the @xmath0-milstein method , using a linear test equation with several multiplicative noise terms .",
    "we have obtained stability conditions guaranteeing asymptotic mean - square stability of the zero solution of the stochastic difference equations resulting from both types of methods applied to the test sde . comparing the stability conditions and for the @xmath0-maruyama and the @xmath0-milstein method , respectively",
    ", it is quite obvious that the latter is more restrictive than the former , due to the fourth and fifth term in , i.e.  @xmath234 , which is always non - negative . in particular , this term is the more restrictive , the larger the parameters in the diffusion term in   are .",
    "now , in the case that these parameters are small , that is the so - called small noise case , it is well known from the corresponding mean - square convergence analysis that maruyama - type methods provide sufficiently accurate methods for practicable choices of step - sizes , see  @xcite .",
    "milstein - type methods include higher order approximations of the diffusion term with the aim that they are accurate methods for more practicable choices of step - sizes just in the case that the diffusion term is large .",
    "in other words , when dealing with sdes with larger diffusion terms , numerical efficiency considerations would suggest using a milstein - type method with a larger step - size rather than a maruyama - type method with a small step - size to obtain numerical approximations of the solution of an sde with a similar accuracy .",
    "however , corollary  [ cormilstab ] indicates that in this case there may be a trade - off and one is faced with restrictions on the step - size for the milstein - type method due to stability reasons .",
    "further , we have shown that the precise stability region of the @xmath0-milstein method depends on the number and magnitude of the noise terms , whereas the stability region of the @xmath0-maruyama method is independent of them .",
    "in particular , it is not possible to define a value @xmath13 such that the @xmath0-milstein method can be called @xmath4-stable for all @xmath235 for the class of sdes for an arbitrary number of driving wiener processes . for the @xmath0-maruyama method @xmath236 , as in the deterministic case and the case of the test equation with @xmath151 .",
    "we provide a modified milstein - type method with a partially implicit diffusion approximation and demonstrate that the resulting stability behaviour can be controlled more favourably . the results highlight that it is necessary to include multi - dimensional noise into test equations and to study their effects on the practical behaviour of the methods .",
