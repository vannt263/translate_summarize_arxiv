    "the origin of the earth magnetic field remains a challenging issue for physicists .",

    "are amplified by a turbulent flow of a conducting fluid .",
    "this problem can be described in its simpler form by a set of coupled partial differential equations ( see section  2 ) .",
    "the state of this system is fully characterised by four independent controlling parameters . the ekman number @xmath0 , which can be interpreted as measuring the ratio of the length of the day to a typical viscous timescale , this number is extremely small in the case of the earth s core ( the earth is in rapid rotation ) . the magnetic prandtl number @xmath1 , measuring the ratio of a typical ohmic timescale to viscous timescale , it is a characteristic of the fluid and is minute for all liquid metals ( including liquid iron in the earth s core ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic prandtl number @xmath2 , also characterizing the fluid and which compares a thermal timescale to a viscous timescale , this number is of order one , or slightly less , but non - vanishing .",
    "finally the rayleigh number @xmath3 , which measures a ratio of driving forced to forced slowing down the motion .",
    "its value is difficult to assess in a simple boussinesq model .",
    "this will be the most obvious controlling parameter , which needs to be varied to investigate dynamo properties .",
    "kutzner and christensen [ ] performed a first systematic exploration of the parameter space available to numerical models of the geodynamo .",
    "they produced a `` phase diagram '' for dynamo action in terms of ekman number @xmath0 and magnetic prandtl number ( or equivalently here roberts number , @xmath4 ) and rayleigh number @xmath3 .",
    "their study was later extended to lower values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in  [ ] .",
    "we present a schematic sketch of their results in figure  [ kutzner ] ( see also the phd thesis of carsten kutzner  [ ] ) .",
    "each diagram corresponds to a given ekman number , ranging here from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "kutzner and christensen identified three `` phases '' on these diagrams . in part of the parameter space , no dynamo solutions were obtained . in the complementary region , in which dynamo is obtained , two regimes are identified .",
    "one at low forcing , characterised by strongly dipolar , but non - reversing dynamos , and another corresponding to reversing , but multipolar dynamos .",
    "this , of course , is not a very good news when comparing these models with the geodynamo ( characterized by a reversing strongly dipolar field ) .",
    "as pointed above , all models presented in these diagrams suffer from parameters extremely remote from their geophysically relevant estimates .",
    "in particular , the ekman number @xmath0 is over - estimated by a factor in excess of a billion and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath1 by a factor close to a million .",
    "in fact this last number offers a ratio of diffusivity which is equal to unity or larger in the numerics , whereas it should be as small as @xmath7 in the earth .",
    "the diagram reveals that if the magnetic prandtl number is decreased in numerical models ( all other parameters being fixed ) , dynamo action is lost !",
    "this does not come as a surprise , as it corresponds to increasing the ohmic resistivity , but appears to prevent any direct comparison of the models with the actual geodynamo .",
    "in fact the main result derived from these phase diagrams is much more optimistic .",
    "the authors noted that the threshold value @xmath8 , below which dipolar dynamos are lost decreases with the ekman number .",
    "they proposed  [ ] a scaling in the form @xmath9 and proposed a numerical fit to @xmath10 ( see  [ ] for a theoretical explanation of this behaviour leading to @xmath11 ) . which could indicate a connection in the parameter space between the models presently available and the regime relevant to the geodynamo .",
    "part of the kutzner & christensen results have also been discussed in  [ ] . in this earlier study",
    ", the authors proposed that for @xmath12 the @xmath13 state is always stable .",
    "the corresponding bifurcations are therefore interpreted as subcritical by the authors . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the authors identify only supercritical bifurcations ( because they find @xmath13 to be unstable ) .",
    "they however did not perform a systematic study to characterise the dynamo bifurcation , nor determined how it is controlled by the governing parameters .",
    "this is the object of the work reported here .",
    "we present here a review of the results obtained and first described in french in morin 2005  [ ]  ( available online ) .",
    "these results were subsequently presented at several international conferences  [ ] .",
    "they were not published in english so far , but have probably inspired more recent articles  [ ] .",
    "we should finally stress that while our results were originally obtained using only the numerical code call `` magic '' ( developed by g.  glatzmaier , u.  christensen and j.  wicht ) , we have since then reproduced these results using the local `` parody''code .",

    "the behavior reported here is reminiscent of self - killing dynamos as described in  [ ] .",
    "we presented here a study of the onset of dynamo action over a wide parameter range .",
    "we should note however that one parameter was , for simplicity , kept constant throughout the entire study : the prandtl number ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to know how this parameter affects the picture presented here .",
    "since this work was performed and published in french in 2005  [ ] , we have further investigated the parameter space towards large values of the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "yet another kind of bifurcation diagram has been produced .",
    "it is characterized by two co - existing branches of different energies .",
    "these results will be presented and discussed elsewhere  [ ] .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of the dynamo bifurcation in a configuration applicable to the earth s liquid outer core , i.e. in a rotating spherical shell with thermally driven motions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the nature of the bifurcation , which can be either supercritical or subcritical or even take the form of isola ( or detached lobes ) strongly depends on the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is described in a range of parameters numerically accessible ( which unfortunately remains remote from geophysical application ) , and we show how the magnetic prandtl number and the ekman number control these transitions . </S>"
