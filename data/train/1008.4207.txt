    "propagation of acoustic or electromagnetic beams is often studied through linear differential equations with coefficients which depend on the medium characteristics . because of the difficulty to estimate parameters and to give well - fitted equations , the medium is often taken to be a linear invariant filter ( lif ) with given spectral gains .",
    "for instance , propagation of ultrasonics through biological tissues is taken to be a filter with complex gain exp@xmath0 .$ ] in scanning , values of parameters allow diagnosis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . the same model is used for losses and dispersion of radiowaves in coaxial cables , free space or fiber optics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider beams reduced to a trajectory in some medium .",
    "beams measurements are very often reduced to the values of quantities available at two points , one at the origin and one at the end point ( for instance the amplitude or the power ) . even if the beam is received in a antenna with a given area",
    ", the information is often added in a coaxial cable or in a wave guide , and reduced to a finite number of complex quantities .",
    "moreover , comparisons about values at the transmitter and at the receiver give insights about the medium , and it is the aim of most devices used in practice ( and this is true for waves in any frequency band , optics , radio , acoustics or ultrasonics ) .",
    "actually , the main difference between sonics or ultrasonics waves and radio or optical waves is the polarization of the last one .",
    "then they are defined by vectors instead of scalars .",
    "this paper highlights this difference .",
    "we define a one - dimensional beam by an electric field @xmath1=@xmath2 at each point of a trajectory .",
    "@xmath3 stands for the time , @xmath4 is the coordinate on the trajectory and @xmath5 is a vector orthogonal to the trajectory . in numerous situations , it is sufficient to consider the amplitude of @xmath6 which defines the power and the spectral content of the wave . then , it is sufficient to model the medium as a linear filtering , as in the case of acoustic wave propagation .",
    "it is no longer the case when polarization phenomena have to be taken into account .",
    "we have to show the evolution of two components @xmath7 of the electric field which defines the wave .",
    "because both components can be linked , the behavior of one component at the time @xmath3 can depend on the other component . in a linear model",
    ", this means that each component is the addition of linear filtering of itself and of the other component .",
    "consequently , the medium has to be defined by a family of four filters .",
    "nevertheless , we will talk about a bi - filter because the operation defines a linear way between two couples of processes , two inputs and two outputs .",
    "we place ourselves in a stationary frame where the processes are stationary ( in the wide sense ) with stationary correlations .",
    "the filters which model the medium will be time invariant with the acronym lif  for linear ( time ) invariant filters and will be defined by complex gains rather than impulse responses .",
    "they generalize the notion of scattering matrix  used for monochromatic waves where each coordinate of the scattered wave is a linear combination of transmitted coordinates .",
    "though power spectra of electromagnetic waves are the most often assumed in limited bands , the definitions and computations will be done for general spectra possibly with infinite support .",
    "section 1 of this paper addresses the definition and properties of bi - filters .",
    "sections 2 and 3 apply results of section 1 to one - dimensional beams .",
