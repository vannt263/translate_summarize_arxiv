    "the initial enhancement in magnetization is possibly a result of thermally activated alignment of small clusters which is slowly overcome by the dominant spin - glass like relaxation of larger clusters . 2 .",
    "the applied field lowers the energy of easy axis direction pointing along the field .",
    "if this now becomes the low energy state , the activated alignment of cluster moments along the field direction will enhance the magnetization with time .",
    "switching off the field favors the restoring of spin - glass like ordering due to prevalent dipole interaction .",
    "this causes magnetization to decay with time . because of the hierarchical nature of dynamics in spin - glass , the set of energy barriers relaxed at temperature t are different from that of t-@xmath123 t .",
    "when the temperature is lowered to t-@xmath123 t after a relaxation at t , the contribution to relaxation at t-@xmath123 t comes from ( i ) the spin - glass like relaxation of active clusters ( at t-@xmath123 t ) and the exchange induced activated alignment of their small neighbors and",
    "( ii ) exchange induced activated alignment of small clusters by the frozen neighbours which were active at t. 3 .",
    "if the field is not changed during thermal cycling then exchange induced activated alignment of small clusters in the above process ( i ) and ( ii ) adds up .",
    "this gives an additional upward shift ( downward shift ) in magnetization for zfc protocol ( for fc protocol ) when the temperature is brought back to t. switching off ( on ) the field during relaxation in zfc protocol ( fc protocol ) at t-@xmath123 t weakens ( ii ) because now zeeman energy does not support ( oppose ) the alignment effort of exchange energy .",
    "additionally , the contribution from alignment of small cluster in ( i ) will be opposite of ( ii ) .",
    "because of the opposite sign in contribution from ( i ) and ( ii ) , they tends to cancel each other and therefore there is no significant shift in magnetization when the temperature is raised back to t.",
