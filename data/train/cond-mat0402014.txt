    "mechanical alloying ( ma ) technique @xcite is an efficient means for synthesizing crystalline compounds , amorphous alloys and unstable and metastable phases @xcite .",
    "ma has also been used to produce materials with nanometer sized grains and alloys whose components have large differences in their melting temperatures and are thus difficult to produce using techniques based on melting .",
    "it is a dry milling process in which a metallic or non - metallic powder mixture is actively deformed in a controlled atmosphere under a highly energetic ball charge .",
    "the few thermodynamics restrictions on the alloy composition open up a wide range of possibilities for property combinations @xcite , even for immiscible elements @xcite .",
    "the temperatures reached in ma are very low , and thus this low temperature process reduces reaction kinetics , allowing the production of poorly crystallized or amorphous materials .",
    "co  nb is one of many systems of interest due to their superior magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "its equilibrium phase diagram shows three stable phases co@xmath8nb@xmath9 , @xmath10-co@xmath11nb and co@xmath12nb , and at least one high - temperature alloy , @xmath13-co@xmath11nb @xcite . besides the techniques used to produce co  nb alloys , which are described in ref .",

    "et al_. @xcite have also shown that induced growth of such amorphous films can be performed by the ion beam assisted deposition ( ibad ) technique . here , we have used ma to produce amorphous co@xmath14nb@xmath1 alloys starting from the crystalline elemental powders .",
    "the chosen compositions were co@xmath2nb@xmath3 ( _ a_-co@xmath2nb@xmath3 ) , co@xmath4nb@xmath5 ( _ a_-co@xmath4nb@xmath5 ) and co@xmath6nb@xmath7 ( _ a_-co@xmath6nb@xmath7 ) . their magnetic properties were determined using an alternating gradient force magnetometer ( agfm ) , and the remanent magnetizations , saturation fields and coercive fields were obtained from the hysteresis loop .",
    "the alloys have a relatively high saturation field , which decreases as the composition becomes richer in co. the coercivity and remanent magnetization reach an optimal value around 57% at.co , making _",
    "a_-co@xmath2nb@xmath3 the hardest magnetic material among the three alloys .",
    "if the amount of co is even increased , the alloy becomes a soft magnetic material .",
    "binary mixtures of co and nb crystalline elemental metals powders , with nominal composition co@xmath2nb@xmath3 , co@xmath4nb@xmath5 and co@xmath6nb@xmath7 were sealed together with several steel balls , under argon atmosphere , in steel vials .",
    "the weight ratio of the ball to powder was 6:1 for all compositions .",
    "the vials were mounted in a spex 8000 shaker mill and the samples were milled for 40 h. in order to keep the vial temperature close to room temperature , a ventilation system was used .",
    "the compositions of the as - milled alloys were determined by x - ray fluorescence method using an edx-700 shimadzu equipment , giving a composition of 25 at.%co and 75 at.%nb for the first alloy , 57 at.%co and 43 at.%nb for the second , and 79 at.%co and 21 at.%nb for the third .",
    "impurity traces were not detected .",
    "the hysteresis loops were obtained at room temperature using a home - made alternating gradient force magnetometer by applying the magnetic field , up to @xmath15 koe , parallel to the plane of sample .",
    "the hysteresis loop of _ a_-co@xmath2nb@xmath3 showing the relative magnetization @xmath16 as a function of the applied field @xmath17 can be seen in fig .",
