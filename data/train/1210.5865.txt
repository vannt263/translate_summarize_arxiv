    "it is known that the asymptotic behaviour of the erds - rnyi random graph @xmath0 , in which every edge of the complete graph on @xmath2 labelled vertices @xmath3 is present with probability @xmath4 independently of the other edges ( see figure [ erfig ] ) , exhibits a phase transition at @xmath5 . on the one hand , for @xmath6 with @xmath7 ,",
    "the largest connected component @xmath8 of @xmath0 incorporates a non - trivial proportion of the @xmath2 original vertices asymptotically .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath9 , then @xmath8 consists of only @xmath10 vertices .",
    "a third kind of behaviour is seen at criticality itself ; for when @xmath11 , the number of vertices of @xmath8 is of order @xmath12 ( all these results can be found in @xcite ) . under a finer scaling @xmath1 , where @xmath13 is fixed  the so - called critical window , it is also possible to describe the asymptotic structure of @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , in this regime , when graph distances are rescaled by @xmath14 , the largest connected component @xmath8 converges to a random fractal metric space , @xmath15 say , whose distribution depends on the particular value of @xmath16 chosen ( @xcite ) . in this article ,",
    "our goal is to add a further level of detail to this picture : we will consider the discrete time simple random walk on @xmath8 in the critical window , and show that it converges , when rescaled appropriately , to a diffusion on @xmath15 .",
    "the precise characterisation of @xmath15 in @xcite involves `` glued '' real trees , and this picture turns out to be especially useful in constructing the limiting diffusion @xmath17 , which we will call the brownian motion on @xmath15 . in particular , in defining @xmath15 , the authors of @xcite start by introducing a random compact real tree @xmath18 . on the same probability space",
    ", a point process is described , and this gives a recipe for selecting a finite number of pairs @xmath19 , @xmath20 , of vertices of @xmath18 .",
    "( note that @xmath21 is a random variable . ) once the joint distribution of @xmath18 and the point process is chosen appropriately , what is shown in @xcite is that the scaling limit of the largest connected component @xmath8 in the critical window is simply the metric space @xmath15 we arrive at from @xmath18 by identifying @xmath22 and @xmath23 for each @xmath24 . to build a process on @xmath15 in this setting , we first note that results of @xcite let us view @xmath18 as an electrical network by equipping it with a corresponding resistance form @xmath25 . from this , we obtain a related resistance form @xmath26 on @xmath15 by `` fusing '' the vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 together for @xmath27 .",
    "finally , letting @xmath28 be the natural measure on @xmath15  the scaling limit of the uniform measure on @xmath8 , we can further prove that @xmath26 is a local , regular dirichlet form on @xmath29 .",
    "it is by applying the standard association between such quadratic forms and markov processes that the brownian motion @xmath17 will be defined .    in proving the main convergence result for the discrete time simple random walk @xmath30 on @xmath8 , an argument developed for demonstrating convergence to the brownian motion on the continuum random tree is adapted .",
    "in @xcite , it was established that for any family of graph trees @xmath31 that converge in a suitable manner to the continuum random tree of aldous ( see @xcite , for example ) , the associated simple random walks converge to a markov process called the brownian motion on the continuum random tree . the key to proving this result was first considering approximations to the simple random walks and the limiting diffusion on subtrees spanning a fixed number of leaves , where proving convergence from the discrete to continuous models was straightforward , and then letting the number of leaves go to infinity . by constructing the sets @xmath8 and @xmath15 from trees as in @xcite",
    ", we are able to define similarly useful approximations for @xmath30 and @xmath17 that take values in subsets spanning a fixed number of vertices of @xmath8 and @xmath15 , respectively . once these subsets and approximating processes have been chosen appropriately , an almost identical argument to the one applied for trees in @xcite yields that @xmath32 in distribution , where we postpone the precise statement of this result until section [ rwc ] . of course , being an example of a random walk in a random environment - type problem , there are two kinds of results such as ( [ rwcresult ] ) that we could prove .",
    "firstly , a quenched result , where we fix a sequence of typical realisations of @xmath8 that converge to a typical realisation of @xmath15 , and secondly , an annealed result , where the distributions of the processes @xmath30 and @xmath17 are averaged over the randomness of the environments @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "we will prove both ; see theorems [ quench ] and [ anne ] , respectively , and we appeal to these results to justify our referring to @xmath17 as brownian motion on @xmath15 .",
    "note that the time scaling factor @xmath2 for the simple random walk on the largest connected component @xmath8 in the critical window has previously been observed in the mixing time asymptotics of @xmath30 , see @xcite , theorem 1.1 .",
    "once the brownian motion @xmath17 has been demonstrated to be the scaling limit of @xmath30 , it is natural to investigate further properties of the process . to make a first step in this direction we again turn to the link between @xmath15 and @xmath18 , which immediately allows us to transfer some known results about the brownian motion on the continuum random tree to our setting . specifically , modulo random mass and distance scaling factors , the distribution of the random compact real tree @xmath18 is absolutely continuous with respect to the distribution of the continuum random tree . thus , when suitably rescaled by constants , a typical realisation of @xmath18 looks exactly like a typical realisation of the continuum random tree .",
    "moreover , since @xmath28 is a non - atomic measure and there are only a finite number of pairs @xmath19 , @xmath24 , it is clear that @xmath28-a.e .",
    "every point of @xmath15 admits a neighbourhood that is isometric to a neighbourhood in @xmath18 . with the local geometry of @xmath15 and @xmath18",
    "being the same and @xmath18 looking like the continuum random tree , it is easy to check that the short - time behaviour of @xmath17 is the same as the short - time behaviour of the brownian motion on the continuum random tree .",
    "for example , if we let @xmath33 be the transition density of @xmath17 , then it is possible to show that every typical realisation of @xmath15 satisfies @xmath34 thus the spectral dimension of ( the brownian motion on ) @xmath15 is almost - surely @xmath35 , which is identical to that of the continuum random tree , see @xcite .",
    "more detailed short - time transition density asymptotics are discussed in section [ propsec ] .    to conclude the introduction ,",
    "let us draw attention to the connections between our results and those thought to hold for critical edge percolation clusters on the lattice @xmath36 . in high dimensions , @xmath37 , large critical edge percolation clusters on @xmath36 , when rescaled , are thought to look like a random structure known as the integrated super - brownian excursion ( see @xcite , section 16.5 , for example ) .",
    "the integrated super - brownian excursion can simply be thought of as a random embedding of the continuum random tree into @xmath38 , and one might therefore hypothesise that by mapping the brownian motion on the continuum random tree into @xmath38 with the same embedding we might be able to define the scaling limit of the random walks on the critical percolation clusters . although in the percolation setting a result along these lines has not yet been proved , this procedure does yield the scaling limit of the random walks on the trees generated by related branching random walk models , at least in the case when @xmath39 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the complete graph on @xmath2 points does not look very much like the integer lattice .",
    "however , the relationship between @xmath15 and the continuum random tree discussed above suggests that , at criticality , the asymptotic structure of the largest connected component of the erds - rnyi random graph , which can be thought of as an edge percolation model , closely corresponds to the asymptotic structure of the large critical clusters in the @xmath36 edge percolation setting , at least locally .",
    "what we conjecture on the basis of the results of this article is that in the critical regime the dynamical properties are also similar .",
    "in fact , work already exists that indicates that the spectral dimension of the scaling limit of the simple random walks on large critical percolation clusters in @xmath36 in high dimensions agrees with the @xmath35 seen at ( [ specdim ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the article is arranged as follows . in section [ sectree ]",
    "we present details of the construction of @xmath17 on typical realisations of @xmath15 .",
    "we also introduce there some approximations for @xmath17 on finite length subsets of @xmath15 , and in section [ seccont ] describe continuity properties of the laws of these .",
    "the distribution of @xmath15 and largest connected component scaling limit result of @xcite are recalled more thoroughly than above in section [ crg ] . in order to formalise the main simple random walk convergence result and",
    "check the measurability of our construction of @xmath17 , we need to introduce a space of paths on compact length spaces , and this is done in section [ contsec ] . in section [ subsetsec ]",
    "we characterise what constitutes the quenched convergence of @xmath8 to @xmath15 in a way that will be most helpful to us , and present some other preliminary results about subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we establish our precise versions of ( [ rwcresult ] ) in section [ rwc ] and conclude the article by outlining some properties of @xmath17 in section [ propsec ] .",
    "the goal of this section is to construct , at least for typical realisations of @xmath15 , the dirichlet form @xmath26 on @xmath29 that will be used to define the limiting diffusion in our main result .",
    "we also introduce some approximations to the process on spaces built from a finite number of line segments .",
    "to do this , it will be enough to work in the deterministic setting .",
    "in particular , until noted otherwise we fix a compact real tree @xmath40 ( @xcite , definition 2.1 , for example ) containing more than one point , and a distinguished vertex @xmath41 , which we call the root .",
    "let @xmath42 be a finite borel measure on @xmath18 satisfying @xmath43 for some @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the open ball of radius @xmath46 ( with respect to the metric @xmath47 ) centred at @xmath48 .",
    "note that this condition guarantees that @xmath42 is of full support .",
    "suppose @xmath49 and @xmath50 are finite collections of vertices of @xmath18 , and write the collection of sets @xmath19 as @xmath51",
    ". define @xmath52 by setting @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54 which is easily checked to be an equivalence relation on @xmath18 .",
    "the canonical projection from @xmath18 into the quotient space @xmath55 will be denoted @xmath56 , and we will also use the notation @xmath57 for @xmath48 . the space @xmath15 becomes a metric space when equipped with the quotient metric @xmath58 ( @xcite , exercise 3.1.13 ) , and we will also define @xmath59 . note that we allow the possibility that @xmath60 . in this case , we simply have that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are identical as metric - measure spaces .",
    "although it would be possible to define the form of interest , @xmath26 , as the limit of resistance forms ( @xcite , definition 2.3 ) on an increasing sequence of finite approximations to the space @xmath15 by applying results of @xcite , a more concise construction is provided by following the steps briefly described in the introduction , i.e. starting with the natural resistance form @xmath25 on the space @xmath18 , which is easily obtained by viewing @xmath18 as a resistance network , and then fusing the vertices at @xmath22 and @xmath23 together for each @xmath24 .",
    "note how the latter description neatly complements the understanding of the quotient metric space @xmath63 as the space @xmath64 glued along the relation @xmath52 . more specifically , by @xcite , theorem 5.4 , there exists a unique resistance form @xmath25 on @xmath18 that satisfies @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , the same result implies that @xmath25 is a local , regular dirichlet form on @xmath67 . given this form ,",
    "let @xmath68 , where , given a function @xmath69 , we define @xmath70 , and set @xmath71 we will eventually show that @xmath26 is local , regular dirichlet form on the space @xmath29 , but first prove that it is a resistance form on @xmath15 and define an associated resistance metric .    @xmath26 is a resistance form on @xmath15 .",
    "the following properties of a resistance form are easily checked from the definition of @xmath26 ( and the fact that @xmath25 is itself resistance form ) : @xmath72 is a linear subspace of functions on @xmath15 containing constants ; @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 is constant on @xmath15 ; after constant functions are quotiented out , then @xmath75 is an inner product on @xmath72 ; for any finite subset @xmath76 and function @xmath77 , there exists a function @xmath78 such that @xmath79 ; if @xmath80 for some @xmath81 , then @xmath82 and @xmath83 . here",
    ", we will merely establish the remaining properties : the inner product space @xmath84 is complete and also @xmath85 for every @xmath86 .    first , if @xmath87 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath84 , then @xmath88 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath89 .",
    "thus , since @xmath25 is a resistance form , there exists a function @xmath90 such that @xmath91 .",
    "noting that @xmath92 for each @xmath24 , applying ( [ dtchar ] ) yields @xmath93 .",
    "in particular , it follows that @xmath94 for each @xmath24 , and so @xmath95 for some @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , @xmath97 , which confirms that @xmath84 is complete .    for any @xmath86",
    ", we can rewrite the supremum in ( [ supeq ] ) as @xmath98 which is finite .",
    "note that , to deduce the above equality , we have again applied the characterisation of @xmath25 at ( [ dtchar ] ) .",
    "given that @xmath26 is a resistance form , by @xcite , theorem 2.3.4 , if we define a function @xmath99 by setting @xmath100 to be equal to the supremum at ( [ supeq ] ) , then @xmath101 is a metric on @xmath15 .",
    "we call this metric the resistance metric on @xmath15 , and the next result shows that it is equivalent to the quotient metric @xmath102 . in the proof we will use the notation @xmath103 to represent the branch - point of @xmath104 , which is the unique point satisfying @xmath105\\cap[[y , z]]\\cap[[z , x]],\\ ] ] where , for two vertices @xmath106 , @xmath107 $ ] is the unique ( non - self intersecting ) path from @xmath108 to @xmath109 in the real tree @xmath18 . furthermore",

    "if the vertices in this network are held at potential @xmath142 , then the total energy dissipation ( see @xcite , section 1.3.5 ) is given by @xmath143 using ideas from @xcite ( in particular , see proof of proposition 5.1 and corollary 1.8 ) , we observe that the final sum here can be rewritten @xmath144 .",
    "hence , if @xmath145 is the effective resistance between vertices in the electrical network described above , then @xmath146 where the first equality is an application of the dirichlet principle for electrical networks ( see @xcite , exercise 1.3.11 , for example ) , the third equality follows from ( [ trace ] ) , and the final two equalities are consequences of the definitions of @xmath26 and @xmath101 respectively .",

    "given this fact and that @xmath26 is a resistance form , to establish that the latter is also a dirichlet form is relatively straightforward .",
    "one point that does require checking is that @xmath173 is a hilbert space , where @xmath174 for @xmath96 , but this can be done by following the proof of @xcite , theorem 2.4.1 . since we already know that @xmath72 is a dense subset of @xmath150 , it is further the case that the dirichlet form @xmath26 is regular .    finally , to prove @xmath26 is local it is necessary to show that @xmath175 for any two functions @xmath176 with disjoint support .",

    "now we have the local , regular dirichlet form @xmath180 on @xmath29 , standard arguments ( @xcite , theorem 7.2.2 ) imply the existence of a corresponding @xmath28-symmetric markov diffusion @xmath181 which we will call brownian motion on @xmath15 .",
    "the factor of @xmath182 here appears a little awkward , but will later ensure the correct time scaling of the process .",

    "so far , we have not fully applied the lower volume asymptotics of ( [ lowervol ] ) .",
    "the importance of this bound is that it will allow us to apply theorem 6.3 of @xcite to deduce the existence of jointly continuous local times for @xmath17 . since the following result can be proved exactly as in the real tree case ( cf .",
