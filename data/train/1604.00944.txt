    "this paper is concerned with the mathematical analysis of an electromagnetic scattering problem in periodic structures , where the wave propagation is governed by the time - domain maxwell equations . the scattering theory in periodic diffractive structures ,",
    "also known as diffraction gratings , has applications in many cutting - edge scientific areas including ultra - fast and high - energy lasers , space flight instruments , astronomy , and synchrotron spectrometers .",
    "a good introduction can be found in @xcite to diffraction grating problems and various numerical approaches .",
    "the book @xcite contains descriptions of several mathematical problems that arise in diffractive optics modeling in industry .",
    "some more recent developments are addressed in @xcite on theory , analysis , and computational techniques of diffractive optics .",
    "the time - harmonic grating problems have been extensively studied by many researchers via either the integral equation methods or the variational methods @xcite .",
    "a survey may be found in @xcite for mathematical studies in rigorous grating theory .",
    "the general result may be stated as follows : the diffraction problem has a unique solution for all but a countable sequence of singular frequencies .",
    "unique solvability for all frequencies can be obtained for gratings which have absorbing media or perfectly electrically conducting surfaces with lipschitz profiles .",
    "numerical methods are developed for both the two - dimensional helmholtz equation ( one - dimensional gratings ) and the three - dimensional maxwell equations ( crossed or two - dimensional gratings ) @xcite .",
    "the time - domain scattering problems have attracted considerable attention due to their capability of capturing wide - band signals and modeling more general material and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "comparing with the time - harmonic problems , the time - domain problems are much less studied due to the additional challenge of the temporal dependence .",
    "rigorous mathematical analysis is very rare",
    ". the analysis can be found in @xcite for the time - domain acoustic and electromagnetic obstacle scattering problems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the analysis of the time - dependent electromagnetic scattering from a three - dimensional open cavity .",
    "numerical solutions can be found in @xcite for the time - dependent wave scattering by periodic structures / surfaces .",
    "the theoretical analysis is still lacking for the time - domain scattering by periodic structures .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyze mathematically the time - domain scattering problem which arises from the electromagnetic wave propagation in a periodic structure . specifically , we consider an electromagnetic plane wave which is incident on a one - dimensional grating in @xmath0 .",
    "so the structure is assumed to be invariant in the @xmath1-direction and periodic in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the three - dimensional maxwell equations can be decomposed into two fundamental polarizations : transverse electric ( te ) polarization and transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarization , where maxwell s equations are reduced to the two - dimensional wave equation .",
    "we shall study the wave equation in two dimensions for both polarizations .",
    "the structure can also be characterized by the medium parameters : the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability .",
    "they are periodic in @xmath2 and assumed only to be bounded measurable functions .",
    "hence our method works for very general gratings whose surfaces / interfaces are allowed to be lipschitz profiles or even graphs of some lipschitz continuous functions .",
    "there are two challenges of the problem : time dependence and unbounded domain . in the frequency domain",
    ", various approaches have been developed to truncate unbounded domains into bounded ones , such as absorbing boundary conditions ( abcs ) , transparent boundary conditions ( tbcs ) , and perfectly matched layer ( pml ) techniques .",
    "these effective boundary conditions are being extended to handle time - domain problems @xcite . utilizing the laplace",
    "transform as a bridge between the time - domain and the frequency domain , we develop an exact time - domain tbc and reduce the problem equivalently into an initial boundary value problem in a bounded domain . using the energy method with new energy functions ,",
    "we show the well - posedness and stability of the time - dependent problem .",
    "the proofs are based on examining the well - posedness of the time - harmonic helmholtz equations with complex wavenumbers and applying the abstract inversion theorem of the laplace transform .",
    "moreover , a priori estimates , featuring an explicit dependence on time and a minimum regularity requirement of the data , are established for the wave field by studying directly the time - domain wave equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ frp ]",
    ", we introduce the model problem and develop a tbc to reduce it into an initial boundary value problem .",
    "section [ srp ] is devoted to the analysis of the reduced problem , where the well - posdeness and stability are addressed and a priori estimates are provided .",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks and directions for future work in section [ cl ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the mathematical model of interest and develop an exact tbc to reduce the scattering problem from an unbounded domain into a bounded domain .",
    "consider the system of time - domain maxwell equations in @xmath0 for @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electric field , @xmath6 is the magnetic field , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability , respectively , and satisfy @xmath9 here @xmath10 are constants .",
    "we assume that the structure is invariant in the @xmath1-direction and thus focus on the one - dimensional grating .",
    "the more complicated problem in biperiodic structures will be considered in a separate work .",
    "there are two fundamental polarizations for the one - dimensional structure :    \\(i ) te polarization .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are @xmath11^{\\top},\\quad \\boldsymbol h(x ,   z , t ) = [ h_1(x ,   z , t ) , 0 , h_3(x ,   z , t)]^{\\top}.\\ ] ] eliminating the magnetic field from ( [ tmw ] ) , we get the wave equation for the electric field : @xmath12    \\(ii ) tm polarization .",

    "there exist constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 such that @xmath23 throughout we also assume that @xmath24 , which is usually satisfied since @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the free space @xmath27 .",

    "consider an incoming plane wave @xmath30 which is incident on the structure from above .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a smooth function and its regularity will be specified later , and @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 , satisfying @xmath35 , is the incident angle , and @xmath36 is the light speed in the free space . clearly , the incident field @xmath37 satisfies the wave equation ( [ te ] ) when @xmath38 .",
    "although the incident field @xmath30 may not be a periodic function in the @xmath2-direction , we can verify that @xmath39 motivated by the uniqueness of the solution , we assume that the total field satisfies the same translation property , i.e. , @xmath40 we define @xmath41 it follows from ( [ cv ] ) that we get @xmath42 which shows that @xmath43 is a periodic function in the @xmath2-direction with period @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , we can verify that the incident field @xmath45 is a trivially periodic function of @xmath2 ( independent of @xmath2 ) since @xmath46    using the change of variables , we have @xmath47 the equation ( [ te ] ) becomes @xmath48 a simple calculation yields that @xmath49 which shows that the equation is a well - defined wave equation .",
    "it is easy to verify that the incident field @xmath45 satisfies with @xmath50 . to impose the initial conditions , we assume that the total field and the incident field vanish for @xmath51 so that the incident field @xmath52 and the scattered field @xmath53 for @xmath51 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath54 in addition @xmath43 is @xmath44-periodic in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "this paper aims to study the well - posedness and stability of the scattering problem .",
