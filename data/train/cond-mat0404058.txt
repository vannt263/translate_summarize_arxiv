    "a remarkable manifestation of the macroscopic quantum nature of superconductivity is seen in the description of the superconducting state by a complex order parameter with an associated phase , @xmath4 , which is a macroscopic quantum variable . for composite materials comprised of multiple superconductor ( @xmath1 ) layers separated by nonsuperconducting materials",
    ", the phase difference @xmath5 between adjacent @xmath1 layers becomes a very relevant quantity . for the case where a nonmagnetic normal metal is sandwiched between two superconductors ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that the minimum free energy configuration corresponds to that having a zero phase difference between the @xmath1 regions , in the absence of current .",
    "the situation becomes substantially modified for superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( @xmath6 ) junctions , where the presence of the magnetic ( @xmath2 ) layers leads to spin - split andreev@xcite states and to a spatially modulated@xcite order parameter that can yield a phase difference of @xmath7 between @xmath1 layers .",
    "these are the so - called @xmath3 junctions .",
    "junctions of this type can occur also in more complicated layered heterostructures of the @xmath8 type , where the relative sign of the pair potential @xmath9 can change between adjacent @xmath1 layers .",
    "continual improvements in well controlled deposition and fabrication techniques have helped increase the experimental implementations of systems containing @xmath3 junctions .",
    "@xcite possible applications to devices and to quantum computing , as well as purely scientific interest , have stimulated further interest in these devices .",
    "the pursuit of the @xmath3 state has consequently generated ample supporting data for its existence and properties : the observed nonmonotonic behavior in the critical temperature was found to be consistent with the existence of a @xmath3 state.@xcite the domain structure in @xmath2 is expected to modify the critical temperature behavior however , depending on the applied field.@xcite the ground state of @xmath6 junctions has been recently measured,@xcite and it was found that @xmath10 or @xmath3 coupling existed , depending on the width @xmath11 of the @xmath2 layer , in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "similarly , damped oscillations in the critical current @xmath12 as a function of @xmath11 suggested also a @xmath10 to @xmath3 transition.@xcite the reported signature in the characteristic @xmath12 curves also indicated a crossover from the @xmath10 to @xmath3 phase in going from higher to lower temperatures.@xcite furthermore , the current phase relation was measured,@xcite demonstrating a re - entrant @xmath12 with temperature variation .",
    "a good understanding of the mechanism and robustness of the @xmath3 state in general is imperative for the further scientific and practical development of this area .",
    "the @xmath3 state in @xmath6 structures was first investigated long ago.@xcite in general , the exchange field in the ferromagnet shifts the different spin bands occupied by the corresponding particle and hole quasiparticles .",
    "this splitting determines the spatial periodicity of the pair amplitude in the @xmath2 layer@xcite and can therefore induce a crossover from the @xmath10 state to the @xmath3 state as the exchange field @xmath13 varies,@xcite or as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the josephson critical current was found to be nonzero at the @xmath10 to @xmath3 transition , as a result from higher harmonics in the current - phase relationship.@xcite it was found that a coexistence of stable and metastable states may arise in josephson junctions , which was also attributed to the existence of higher harmonics.@xcite if the magnetization orientation is varied , the @xmath3 state may disappear,@xcite in conjunction with the appearance of a triplet component to the order parameter . a crossover between @xmath10 and @xmath3 states by varying the temperature",
    "was explained within the context of a andreev bound state model that reproduced experimental findings.@xcite in the ballistic limit a transition occurs if the parameters of the junction are close to the crossover at zero temperature.@xcite an investigation into the ground states of long ( but finite ) josephson junctions revealed a critical geometrical length scale which separates half - integer and zero flux states.@xcite the lengths of the individual junctions were also found to have important implications , as a phase modulated state can occur through a second order phase transition.@xcite    nevertheless , little work has been done that studies the stability of the @xmath3 state for an @xmath6 junction from a complete and systematic standpoint , as a function of the relevant parameters . this is _ a fortiori _",
    "true for layered systems involving more than one junction , each of which can in principle exist in the 0 or the @xmath3 state , or for superlattices .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "the existence or absence of @xmath3 junction states is intimately connected to the spatial behavior of @xmath9 and of the pair amplitude @xmath14 ( which oscillates in the magnetic layers ) , and thus the precise form of these quantities must be calculated self - consistently , so that the resulting @xmath14 corresponds to a minimum in the free energy .",
    "an assumed , non self consistent form for the pair potential , typically a piecewise constant in the @xmath1 layers , often deviates very substantially from the correct self consistent result , and therefore may often lead to spurious conclusions .",
    "indeed , the assumed form may in effect force the form of the final result , thereby clearly leading to misleading results .",
    "self - consistent approaches , despite their obvious superiority , are too infrequently found in the literature primarily because of the computational expense inherent in the variational or iterative methods necessary to achieve a solution .",
    "a second problem is that investigation the relative stability of self - consistent states requires an accurate calculation of their respective condensation energies , and that , too , is not an easy problem .    in this paper , we approach in a fully self consistent manner the question of the stability of states containing @xmath3 junctions in @xmath15 multilayer structures .",
    "as has already been shown in trilayers,@xcite it can be the case that , for a given set of geometrical and material parameters , more than one self consistent solution exists , each with a particular spatial profile for @xmath9 involving a junction of either the 0 or @xmath3 type . it will be demonstrated below that this is in fact a very common situation in these heterostructures : one can typically find several solutions , all with a negative condensation energy , i.e. , they are all stable with respect to the normal state .",
    "thus a careful analysis is needed to determine whether each state is a global or local minimum of the condensation free energy .",
    "this determination is , as we shall see , very difficult to make from numerical self - consistent results , because it requires a very accurate computation of the free energies of the possible superconducting states , from which the normal state counterpart must then be subtracted .",
    "this subtraction of large quantities to obtain a much smaller one makes the problem numerically even more challenging than that of achieving self - consistency , since although the number of terms involved is the same , the numerical accuracy required is much greater . until now ,",
    "this has been seen as a prohibitive numerical obstacle . removing",
    "this obstacle involves a careful analysis and computation of the eigenstates for each state configuration , that is , the energy spectrum of the whole system .    the numerical method we will discuss and implement overcomes these difficulties , and therefore enables us to determine the relative stability of the different states involved , as we shall see , for a variety of @xmath16 multilayer structure types , and broad range of parameters .",
    "the condensation energies for the several states found in a fully self consistent manner , are accurately computed as a function of the relevant parameters .",
    "the material parameters we investigate include , interfacial scattering , fermi wave vector mismatch , and magnetic exchange energy , while the geometrical parameters are the superconductor and ferromagnet thicknesses , and total number of layers .",
    "we will see that as the number of @xmath1 layers increases , the number of possible stable junction configurations correspondingly increases .",
    "our emphasis is on system sizes with @xmath1 layers of order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath17 , separated by nanoscale magnetic layers . in order to retain useful information that depends on details at the atomic length scale ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the various quasiclassical approaches and use a microscopic set of equations that does not average over spatial variations of the order of the fermi wavelength .",
    "this is particularly significant in our multiple layer geometry , where interfering trajectories can give important contributions to the quasiparticle spectra , owing to the specular reflections at the boundaries , and normal and andreev reflections at the interfaces.@xcite the influence of these microscopic phenomena is neglected in alternative approaches involving averaging over the momentum space governing the quasiparticle paths .",
    "thus , our starting point is fully microscopic the bogoliubov de - gennes ( bdg ) equations,@xcite which are a convenient and physically insightful set of equations that govern inhomogeneous superconducting systems .",
    "it is also appropriate for the relatively small heterostructures we are interested in , to consider the clean limit .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we write down the relevant form of the real - space bdg equations , and establish notation . after introducing an appropriate standing wave basis , we develop expressions for the matrix elements needed in the numerical calculations of the quasiparticle amplitudes and spectra .",
    "the iterative algorithm which embodies the self - consistency procedure is reviewed .",
    "we then explain how to use the self consistent pair amplitudes and quasiparticle spectra to calculate the free energy , as necessary to distinguish among the possible stable and metastable states . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we illustrate for several junction geometries the spatial dependence of the pair amplitude @xmath14 , which is a direct measure of the proximity effect and gives a physical understanding of the various self consistent states we find .",
    "we display this quantity as a function of the important physical parameters .",
    "the stability of systems containing various numbers of @xmath3 junctions is then clarified through a series of condensation energy calculations that again take into consideration the material and geometrical parameters mentioned above . of importance",
    "experimentally is the local density of states ( dos ) , which we also illustrate for certain multilayer configurations .",
    "we find differing signatures for the possible configurations that should make them discernible in tunneling spectroscopy experiments . to conclude , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize the results .",
    "in this section we briefly review the form that the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations@xcite take for the @xmath18 multilayered heterostructures we study .",
    "additional details can be found in refs .  .",
    "the bdg equations are particularly appropriate for the investigation of the stability of layered configurations in which the pair amplitude may or may not change sign between adjacent superconducting layers .",

    "the spin - splitting effects of the exchange field coupled with the pairing interaction in the @xmath1 regions , results in a nontrivial spatial dependence of the pair potential , which is further compounded by the normal and andreev scattering events that occur at the multiple @xmath18 interfaces .",

    "the thicknesses , usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath101 and @xmath102 , will be varied over rather extended ranges .",
    "as we study the effect of each one of these parameters by varying it in the appropriate range , we will be holding the others constant at a certain value .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , the values of the parameters held constant will take the `` default '' values @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "one important derived length is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the fermi wavevectors of the up and down magnetic bands .",
    "as is well known@xcite , this quantity determines the approximate spatial oscillations of the pair amplitude in the magnet . in terms of the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath91 we can define : @xmath111 at @xmath103 and @xmath106 one has @xmath112 increasing to @xmath113 at @xmath114 .",

    ", one must assume an initial particular form for the pair potential , to start the iteration process .",
    "this permits a straightforward diagonalization of the matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ mbogo ] ) for a given set of geometrical and material parameters , for each value of the transverse energy @xmath63 .",
    "the initial guess of @xmath29 is always chosen as a piecewise constant @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the zero temperature bulk gap , and the signs depend on the possible configuration being investigated ( see below ) .",
    "self consistency is deemed to have been achieved when the difference between two successive @xmath29 s is less than @xmath117 at every value of @xmath20 .",
    "the minimum number of @xmath63 variables needed for self consistency is around @xmath118 different values of @xmath63 . in practice however , use of a value close to this minimum is insufficient to produce smooth results for the local dos .",
    "therefore , we first calculate @xmath29 self consistently using @xmath118 , after which iteration is continued with @xmath119 increased by a factor of ten .",
    "the computed spectra then summed according to eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) are smooth and further increases in @xmath119 produce no discernible change in the outcome .",
    "this two - step procedure leads to considerable savings in computer time .",
    "the convergence properties and net computational expense obviously depend also on the dimension of the matrix to be diagonalized , dictated by the number of basis functions , @xmath64 , which scales linearly with system size @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the computational time then increases approximately as @xmath121 , which can be a formidable issue . for the largest structures considered in this paper ,",
    "the resultant matrix dimension is then @xmath122 for each @xmath63 .",
    "the number of iterations needed for self consistency depends on the initial guess .",
    "if the self consistent state turns out to be composed of junctions of the same types as the initial guess , as specified by the signs in the @xmath115 , then forty or fifty iterations are usually sufficient .",
    "but a crucial point is that , as we shall see , not all of the initial junction configurations lead to self consistent solutions of the same type .",
    "since the self - consistency condition is derived from a free energy minimization condition , this means that some of the initial guesses do not lead to minima in the free energy with the same junction configuration as the initial guess , and thus that locally stable states of that type do not exist , for the particular parameter values studied . in this case , the number of iterations required to get a self consistent solution increases dramatically , since the pair potential has to reconfigure itself into a much different profile .",
    "the number of iterations in those cases can exceed 400 .",

    "[ fig13 ] we present results for an @xmath6 trilayer , for two contrasting values of the mismatch parameter @xmath91 . as usual , results labeled as  0 \" and  @xmath3 \" are for the case where the self consistent states plotted are of these types .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath3 state curves corresponding to @xmath176 , where ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] )",
    "the 0 state is barely metastable , have clearly distinct signatures , with a smaller gap opening for the @xmath10 state , and consequently more subgap quasiparticle states .",
    "therefore , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , when there is little mismatch the pair amplitude is relatively large in the @xmath2 layer .",
    "when there is more mismatch the proximity effect weakens , the gap opens and large peaks form which progressively become more bcs - like as the mismatch increases ( @xmath91 decreases ) to @xmath173 . this progression takes a different form for the 0 and @xmath3 states , as one can see by careful comparison of the curves . in the bottom panel",
    "we demonstrate the effect of the barrier height .",
    "the results are displayed as in the top panel , but with the dimensionless height @xmath93 taking the place of the mismatch parameter .",
    "this figure should be viewed in conjunction with the top panel of fig .",
    "one of the values of @xmath93 chosen ( @xmath177 ) is again such that the 0 state is barely metastable , while for the other value the 0 and @xmath3 states have similar condensation energies . for @xmath93 close to 0.31",
    "there is a marked contrast between the two plots , with the gap clearly opening wider , and containing more structure for the @xmath3 state . at larger @xmath93",
    "the gap becomes larger in both cases , with the bcs - like peaks increasing in height .",
    "thus , as the barriers becomes larger , one is dealing with nearly independent superconducting slabs and the plots become more similar .",
    "the largest difference therefore , occurs , as for the mismatch , at the intermediate values more likely to be found experimentally .",
    "it is also illustrative to display the dos in a three dimensional format .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ fig14 ] , the normalized dos is presented as a function of @xmath178 and @xmath91 for the seven layer structures previously discussed .",
    "this permits a much more extensive range of @xmath91 values to be examined .",
    "the panel arrangement is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] : in the top two panels , all @xmath1 layers have the same thickness ( @xmath164 ) while in the bottom ones the thickness of the inner ones is doubled . on the right column",
    "( panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) the self - consistent results shown were obtained by starting the iteration process with an initial guess of the @xmath140 type , in which case , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , the solution is also of the @xmath140 type .",
    "the left column panels were obtained from an initial guess of the @xmath142 type and therefore correspond , as one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , to solutions of the @xmath142 type for @xmath146 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath179 ( panel ( c ) ) , and to solutions of the @xmath143 type otherwise .",
    "there is no overlap among the results in the four panels .",
    "one sees again that as mismatch increases the bcs like peaks become more prominent and move out , trending towards their bulk positions , while the gap opens .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath140 results for the doubled @xmath22 inner layers are smoother and show clearly a broader gap throughout , due to the extended @xmath1 geometry .",
    "the dos behavior observed here is entirely consistent with the condensation energy results found .",
    "in summary , we have found self consistent solutions to the microscopic bdg equations for @xmath6 and @xmath138 structures , for a wide range of parameter values .",
    "we have shown that , in most cases , several such self consistent solutions coexist , with differing spatial dependence of the pair potential @xmath9 and the pair amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "thus , there can be in general competing local minima of the free energy .",
    "determining their relative stability requires the computation of their respective condensation free energies , which we have done by using an efficient , accurate approach that does not involve the quasiparticle amplitudes directly , and requires only the eigenenergies and the pair potential .    for @xmath6 trilayers ( single junctions )",
    ", we found that both @xmath3 and @xmath10 junction states exist for a range of values of the relevant parameters .",
    "we have displayed results for the pair amplitude , which give insight into the superconducting correlations , and for the condensation free energies of each configuration , to determine the true equilibrium state .",
    "we have shown that a transition ( which is in effect of first order in parameter space ) can occur between the @xmath10 and @xmath3 states for a critical value of @xmath91 . the difference in condensation energies between the two possible states exhibits oscillations as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "this behavior is strongly dependent on the width of the @xmath1 layers . for @xmath22",
    "equal to one coherence length @xmath17 , there exists a range of @xmath39 in which either a @xmath10 or @xmath3 state survives , but not both . increasing the @xmath1 width by about @xmath180 restores the coexistence of both states .",
    "several interesting phenomena arise when one explores the geometrical parameters of trilayer structures . for a fixed ferromagnet width @xmath11 , and parameters values that lead to a @xmath3 state",
    ", we found ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) that the @xmath3 configuration remains the ground state of the system as @xmath22 varies .",
    "the @xmath3 state first appears at small @xmath22 ( @xmath181 ) , and then its condensation energy declines monotonically towards the bulk limit .",
    "the metastable @xmath10 state begins at larger @xmath182 , and its condensation energy declines also slowly over the range of @xmath22 studied .",
    "the other relevant length that was considered is @xmath11 .",
    "the condensation energy is , for both states , an oscillatory function of @xmath11 .",
    "the oscillations become better defined , and the possibility of both @xmath10 and @xmath3 states coexisting increases , at larger @xmath22 . as expected , we find that the condensation energy has very similar properties when either @xmath11 or @xmath39 varies .",
    "the period approximately agrees with the estimate given by @xmath108 , which governs the oscillations of the pair amplitude and in general , of other single particle quantities .",
    "the results for the dos reflect the crossover from a state with populated subgap peaks to a nearly gapped bcs - like behavior as @xmath91 is decreased or the barrier height @xmath93 increased .",
    "signatures that may help to experimentally identify the @xmath10 and @xmath3 configurations were seen .    as the number of layers increases , so does the number of competing stable and metastable junction configurations .",
    "we considered two types of seven layers structures , and found that doubling the width of the inner @xmath1 layers ( which are bounded on each side by ferromagnets ) , resulted typically in different quasiparticle spectra and pair amplitudes , compared to the situation when all @xmath1 layers have the same @xmath22 . for large mismatch or barrier strength ,",
    "the phase of the pair amplitude in each layer is independent , and configurations are nearly degenerate , but as each of these parameters diminishes there is a crossing over to a situation where the free energies of each configuration are well - separated . at certain values of @xmath91 and @xmath93 , some configurations become unstable .",
    "these values are different depending on the type of system ( single or double inner layers ) . for fixed @xmath39 and @xmath11",
    "we found that if a state is stable at no mismatch and zero barrier , then it remains at least metastable over a very wide range of @xmath91 and @xmath93 values .",
    "our results showed that self - consistency can not be neglected as the number of layers increases , due to the nontrivial and intricate spatial variations in @xmath14 that become possible .    for seven layers , we studied in detail the condensation free energies of the four symmetric junction states , @xmath183 and @xmath143 , in the previously introduced notation .",
    "we first investigated the stable states as a function of @xmath91 and @xmath93 .",
    "in contrast to the three layer system , we found that states could become unstable even when the condensation energy did not tend to zero for nearby values of the relevant parameters . for double width inner layered structures",
    ", we found a greater spread in the free energies between the four states , and the instability found in certain cases for the @xmath142 and @xmath143 states was shifted in @xmath91 and @xmath93 , in agreement with the pair amplitude results .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that these results are representative of what occurs for superlattices .",
    "we again found transitions upon varying @xmath91 and the number and sequence of the transitions is now more intricate ( see figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the geometrical properties revealed that scattering at the interfaces modifies the expected damped oscillatory behavior of the condensation energy as a function of @xmath11 . in effect , the barriers introduce significant atomic scale oscillations that smear the periodicity .",
    "this underlines the importance of a microscopic approach for the investigation of nanostrucutres . as with the @xmath91 dependence",
    ", we also showed that the global minima in the free energy is different for the two structures as @xmath11 changes .",
    "the configuration of the ground state of the system with @xmath1 layers of uniform width was more variable in parameter space , compared to when the inner layers are doubled , ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "finally , we calculated the dos , to illustrate and compare the differences in the spectra for the two different seven layer geometries .",
    "of the two , the energy gap for the single inner layer case , and @xmath140 stable state , contains more subgap states , for the specific examples plotted ( figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] ) due to stronger pair breaking effects of the exchange field .",
    "these states fill in increasingly with decreased mismatch .",
    "our results were obtained in the clean limit , which is appropriate for the relatively thin structures envisioned here .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .   in conjunction with realistic comparison with experiments,@xcite the influence of impurities can be taken into account by replacing the clean value of @xmath17 with an effective one .",
    "a separate important issue is that of the free energy barriers separating the different free energy minima we have found , and hence to which degree are metastable states long lived .",
    "our method can not directly answer this question , but from the macroscopic symmetry differences in the pair amplitude structure of the different states one would have to conclude that the barriers are high and the metastable states could be very long lived .",
    "we expect that the transitions found here in parameter space at constant temperature will be reflected in actual first order phase transitions as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "such transitions would presumably be very hysteretic .",
    "we hope to examine this question in the future .",
