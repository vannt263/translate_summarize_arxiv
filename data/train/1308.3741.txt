    "when brownian particles are placed in an asymmetric potential substrate in the presence of an external ac drive , it is possible to realize a so - called `` rocking ratchet '' effect in which the particles undergo net dc motion @xcite .",
    "ratchet effects can also be realized using other forms of external driving such as by flashing the substrate on and off to create what is called a flashing ratchet @xcite .",
    "ratchets have been studied and experimentally realized for a variety of systems including colloidal particles on asymmetric substrates @xcite , vortices in type - ii superconductors interacting with nanostructured pinning sites @xcite , and granular media on vibrated asymmetric substrates @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to realize ratchet effects on symmetric substrates provided that the external driving has some form of asymmetry @xcite .",
    "more recently , what has been termed `` active ratchets '' have been realized in systems where there is no external ac driving or flashing but where the particles are self - driven .",
    "active matter systems contain self motile particles @xcite and include biological systems such as swimming bacteria @xcite , moving cells @xcite , and flocks of birds or fish @xcite , as well as non - biological systems such as artificial swimmers @xcite and self motile colloidal particles @xcite .    in an experiment by galjada _",
    "et al . _ , when run - and - tumble swimming _ e. coli _ were placed in a microfabricated array of v - shaped funnels , the bacteria concentrated on the side of the container towards which the funnel openings were pointing , indicating the existence of a ratchet effect @xcite .",
    "when non - swimming bacteria that undergo only weak brownian motion were placed in the same funnel array , the ratchet effect was absent .",
    "active ratchet effects have also been observed in funnel geometries for swimming animals as well as artificial swimmers @xcite .",
    "subsequent numerical studies showed that this ratchet behavior can be captured using a model of point particles that undergo run and tumble dynamics along with a barrier interaction rule stating that when the particles interact with a barrier they run along the barrier rather than reflecting off of it @xcite .",
    "as the run length of the particles is increased , the ratchet effect also increases , while in the limit of brownian motion the ratchet transport is lost .",
    "other studies showed explicitly that the rectification is caused by the breaking of detailed balance that occurs when the particles interact with the barriers , and that the particles must spend a long enough time running along the barrier for rectification to occur @xcite .",
    "for other types of barrier interactions such as reflection @xcite or scattering @xcite , the rectification is lost . in these simulations",
    "it was also shown that the particles accumulate in funnel tips and along boundaries @xcite , a phenomenon that is also observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "active ratchets have been studied for other types of swimming organisms @xcite such as crawling cells @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "when collective effects are included @xcite a ratchet reversal can occur where for a certain range of parameters the particles ratchet along the easy direction of the funnel , while for other parameters the ratchet motion occurs against the easy flow direction @xcite .",
    "it was recently proposed that active ratchet effects can arise on symmetrical substrates for certain models @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising applications for active ratchets is sorting , where different species or particles with different run - and - tumble swimming lengths could be sorted due to the different speed or direction of motion through a ratchet geometry of one type of particle compared to another @xcite .",
    "variants on this type of ratchet effect have been harnessed to create active matter powered gears , where asymmetric gears immersed in an assembly of active matter particles exhibit rotation in a preferred direction @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals to use asymmetric barriers to capture active matter particles @xcite .",
    "another method for sorting rectified brownian particles is to apply a dc drift to the particles that forces them to move through a lattice of asymmetric obstacles . in this geometry ,",
    "particles with different diffusion coefficients follow different trajectories through the array , such that the particle motion perpendicular to the drift force varies as a function of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "this and related methods have been used to continuously sort particles such as dna strands of different lengths using asymmetric post arrays @xcite . there have also been several other studies on how to sort particles with different diffusive constants in periodic arrays when there is an additional dc drift applied @xcite .    in this work",
    "we examine active ratchet systems in which the particles interact with an array of asymmetric barriers in the presence of an additional dc drift force .",
    "we consider run - and - tumble particles interacting with two barrier geometries .",
    "for an array of v shapes or funnels , in the absence of a drive the particles exhibit an active ratchet effect and move in the easy flow direction ; however , when a dc drive is applied against the ratchet effect , we find a ratchet reversal , indicating that it should be possible to set the dc drive such that particles with different run lengths move in opposite directions through the funnels .",
    "the velocity - force curves contain nonlinear features that vary as the run length changes .",
    "for example , for a fixed dc drive applied against the easy flow direction , increasing the run length initially increases the flow of particles in the reversed ratchet direction as the trapping of particles at the funnel tips is reduced ; however , at long run lengths the reversed motion in the direction of the dc drive is suppressed when the forward ratchet effect begins to dominate .",
    "we show that the ratchet effect can be controlled by applying a dc drive perpendicular to the the ratchet direction .",
    "inclusion of steric interactions between particles reduces the ratchet effect , and the magnitude of the reduction increases as the size or density of the particles increases . for an array of even l - shaped barriers , application of a dc drive can increase the rectification transverse to the applied drive by almost an order of magnitude compared to the drive - free case . for this geometry ,",
    "when steric interactions between the particles are included , the transverse ratchet effect is enhanced for some run lengths and particle densities and suppressed for others .",

    ", @xmath63 increases for the interacting particle system until reaching a plateau . for values of @xmath94",

    "these results show that steric interactions in combination with a dc drive and short but finite run lengths increase the transverse ratchet effect , while for long run lengths the steric interactions decrease the ratchet effect .",
    "this indicates that it should be possible to use the l - shaped barriers to sort particles based on both run length and particle radius .",
    "we have investigated self - driven particles undergoing run - and - tumble dynamics in the presence of arrays of v- and l- shaped barriers . for the v - shaped barriers in the absence of a drive",
    ", we find a spontaneous ratchet effect where the particles have a net motion in the easy flow direction of the barriers .",
    "the efficiency of this ratchet effect increases with increasing run length , as found in earlier studies of single rows of barriers and in experiments . when we apply a dc drift force in the direction opposite to this ratchet effect , we obtain nonlinear velocity - dc force response curves .",
    "we also observe regimes in which particles with different run lengths move in opposite directions .",
    "the introduction of steric particle - particle interactions monotonically reduces the ratchet effect . for the even l - shaped barriers , which have both arms the same length , we measure the particle velocity in the direction perpendicular to the dc drive and find a transverse ratchet effect that can be substantially enhanced by the dc drive .",
    "the inclusion of steric interactions can also increase the magnitude of the transverse ratchet effect .",
    "when the particle radii become too large , this increase is suppressed since fewer particles can interact with each barrier .",
    "the increase in the transverse ratchet effect occurs for systems with small but finite run lengths and intermediate particle densities or radii .",
    "when the run lengths are long , the addition of steric interactions generally reduces the ratchet effect .",
    "our results show that under a dc drift , active ratchet effects can be substantially enhanced , and provide another approach for controlling the sorting of active matter .",
    "we also find that steric interactions can in some cases produce an increase in the ratchet effectiveness .",
