    "although more than 30 years have elapsed since brinkman and rice @xcite published their pioneering work on the propagation of a hole in a quantum antiferromagnet , this subject still attracts a lot of attention .",
    "central to this problem is the question whether the motion of a hole in a strongly correlated system is coherent or not , i.e. , whether the hole can be considered as a quasi  particle in the sense of landau s fermi  liquid theory , or whether , as was first suggested by anderson @xcite , it is more appropriate to view the hole as a constituent particle of a luttinger  like liquid . for a long time",
    ", the interest in this question has been fueled by the expectation that an accurate description of the hole dynamics in a strongly correlated electron system would be the crucial first step towards an understanding of the physics of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "more recently , this interest has been revived , since the dynamics of holes in one ( 1d ) and two  dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnets has become experimentally accessible in angle  resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "the key quantity that can in principle be obtained from the results of arpes is the spectral weight @xmath4 at the ground state energy @xmath5 of the systems .",
    "a nonvanishing spectral weight , @xmath6 , implies that the hole is a quasi  particle , e.g. , a spin - polaron consisting of the bare hole with a spin polarisation cloud around it . on the contrary , a vanishing @xmath4 signals that the hole causes a global rearrangement of the original ground state such that the exact single  hole wave function becomes orthogonal to the wave function of a bare hole in the antiferromagnetic ground state .",
    "arpes data for the one  dimensional copper oxide chain compound srcuo@xmath7 , see ref .  , and for the two - dimensional layered compound sr@xmath7cuo@xmath7cl@xmath7 , see ref .",
    ", show that the hole dynamics differ significantly between the 1d and the 2d case ( see the discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "the features of the spectra of the 1d compound fit rather well with the concept of spin  charge separation that has emerged from bethe  ansatz and bosonization studies of the 1d hubbard model @xcite and from the exact solution of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at the supersymmetric point @xcite . theoretically , spin  charge separation implies that for long wavelengths , the hamiltonian of a hole can be decomposed into two commuting parts , @xmath8 , where both the holon part @xmath9 and the spinon part @xmath10 , are free - fermion hamiltonians @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the single ",
    "hole green s function takes the form g(p , ) = g_h ( p - q , ) z(q , ) .    here",
    ", @xmath11 is the propagator of a free holon , whereas the function @xmath12 is entirely determined by the spinon dynamics ; @xmath13 is the spinon momentum .",
    "while the holon green s function @xmath14 is a free - fermion propagator indeed , @xmath15 with @xmath16 the holon kinetic energy , the spinon contribution @xmath12 is a highly nontrivial singular function . technically , this last feature has its origin in the fact that the original hole operator @xmath17 does not simply factorize into a holon and a spinon operator , @xmath18 .",
    "rather , in the representation of @xmath17 by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , an additional phase factor @xmath21 is needed , where the phase @xmath22 depends on the spinon operators @xmath23 only .",
    "this phase factor accounts for the _ phase  string _ effect @xcite : as the physical hole moves through the ( quasi)ordered spin background , it trails a string of overturned spins behind it . using the _ phase  string _ picture ,",
    "suzuura and nagaosa @xcite have obtained a qualitatively correct result for the single ",
    "hole spectral function in 1d .",
    "we note , however , that sorella and parola @xcite have derived their detailed results for the spinon function @xmath12 in 1d without making use of a _ phase  string _ picture . thus in 1d ,",
    "the different approaches lead to the same conclusion : there is spin  charge separation in this case , and the hole green s function shows luttinger  liquid  like behavior . a recent quantum monte ",
    "carlo ( qmc ) simulation of the single  hole dynamics in the one  dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model has confirmed these results @xcite .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "many studies of the hole dynamics in the two  dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model have been based on an effective hamiltonian which describes the hole as a spinless fermion that is coupled linearly to the magnon excitations of the antiferromagnetic background . in obtaining the hole",
    "green s function , the coupling between the hole and the magnons is then treated in the self  consistent born approximation ( scba ) , and a normal quasi ",
    "particle peak is found in the single - hole spectral function @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the scba is a perturbative method so that the quasi  particle picture is inherent in this method",
    ". however , a finite quasi - particle weight of a hole has also been found in a non - perturbative large - spin study of the 2d t - j model @xcite .",
    "moreover , a recent qmc simulation @xcite lends support to these results in a wide range of the model parameter @xmath24 and of the momentum @xmath25 of the propagating hole .",
    "but , remarkably , two theoretical predictions by sorella @xcite concerning the behavior of the quasi  particle weight z(q ) for @xmath26 at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath27 are less well confirmed by the simulations in ref .  .",
    "apart from this seemingly minor discrepancy between qmc simulation and certain theoretical predictions , there is further work which casts doubt on the validity of the quasi  particle picture for a hole in the two  dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model : results from a high temperature series expansion for the momentum distribution of the particles in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model show a violation of luttinger s theorem @xcite .",
    "this means that the ground state of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model is not connected adiabatically to the ground state of the noninteracting model as would be the case for a normal fermi  liquid consisting of quasi",
    " particles . more directly ,",
    "it is claimed by weng _",
    "_ @xcite that the phase  string picture , which explains the vanishing of the quasi  particle weight in 1d , applies in 2d too and has the same effect there . despite this apparent failure of the quasi  particle picture , these authors suggest in ref .   that the spectral features seen in arpes can be explained satisfactorily in the framework of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model by their theory .",
    "however , in a very recent qmc study mishchenko _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite contradict this suggestion , as they confirm the quasi  particle picture already found by brunner _",
    "_ @xcite .    in view of these contradictions between numerical and analytic analyses ,",
    "we propose a new analytic approach to the calculation of the quasi  particle weight @xmath4 of a single hole in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "our method has the advantage of being applicable in arbitrary space dimensions and is thus suitable to detect differences between the 1d and the 2d case . in 1d",
    ", our results are compatible with a power  law decay of the weight @xmath4 as the system size @xmath28 increases to infinity , @xmath29 . on the contrary in 2d",
    ", this weight remains finite in the thermodynamic limit indicating that the quasi  particle picture is valid in this case .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section ii contains the derivation of the effective action of a single  hole in an antiferromagnetic background with the method of coherent states @xcite . in the later parts of the paper , we wish to employ a semiclassical expansion , i.e. , an expansion in powers of the inverse spin length @xmath3 . for this reason ,",
    "we generalise the conventional @xmath0-@xmath1 model in which every lattice site is either occupied by a spin @xmath30 particle or empty , to the case where the lattice sites are occupied either by an object with arbitrary but fixed spin @xmath2 ( particle ) or by an object with spin @xmath31 ( hole ) @xcite .",
    "we implement this modification by an appropriate choice of the coherent  state representation for the particles which at the same time satisfies explicitely the constraint of forbidden double occupancy . in describing the local coupling of the hole to the spin degrees of freedom",
    ", it turns out to be crucial to use local @xmath32 fields as the basic variables of the effective action instead of working with the local sublattice magnetization . in section iii",
    ", we employ the effective action of section ii to obtain a path  integral representation for the single",
    " hole green s function .",
    "our aim is to extract from this function an expression for the quasi  particle weight @xmath4 of the hole which exhibits explicitly the dependence of @xmath4 on the system parameters , in particular its dependence on the linear system size @xmath28 .",
    "to achieve this goal , we have to take recourse to the semiclassical expansion . in section",
    "iv , we present and discuss our final results .",
    "technicalities of the developments in sections ii and iii are deferred to appendices a and b.",

    "the infrared divergent terms in @xmath148 show that instead of a straightforward expansion a renormalization group treatment is necessary .",
