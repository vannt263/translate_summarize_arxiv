    "the distribution of the 6.7  kev x - ray emission line along the galactic plane is strongly peaked at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the line originates from a k@xmath8 transition of highly ionized iron . together with its large penetrating power delving through a @xmath910@xmath10  h  @xmath3 extinction",
    ", the emission is an indispensable tool to trace the high - energy activity and to reveal the x - ray source demographics in a heavily attenuated environment , such as the galactic center region , where the enormous density of gas and dust , the strong magnetic fields , and the existence of a super massive black hole influence every aspect of the transmigration of energy and matter @xcite .",
    "both the extended emission and the ensemble of numerous discrete sources contribute to the 6.7  kev emission .",
    "the nature of the extended emission was identified as a hot plasma having a temperature of @xmath06.5  kev , distributed across @xmath0250  pc ( @xcite , ) . for discrete sources , several different x - ray populations with thermal emission play dominant roles .",
    "cataclysmic variables ( cv ) , binaries of a white dwarf and predominantly a late - type dwarf star , are major contributors to the 6.7  kev line , considering its large population and thermal plasma with emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite , ) . low - mass young stellar objects ( yso ) or pre  main - sequence late - type sources are other types of candidates .",
    "they have elevated x - ray activity compared to their main - sequence phases , and show a hard thermal x - ray emission with the 6.7  kev line both during the occasional flare and quiescent phases @xcite .",
    "they are expected to be numerous in the galactic center region , where @xmath010% of the star formation of the entire galaxy takes place @xcite .",
    "in addition to these late - type populations , early - type sources are also expected to contribute to the 6.7  kev emission .",
    "main - sequence field o - type stars do not show hard x - ray emission with their plasma temperatures below @xmath01  kev @xcite , but recent observations reveal that some main - sequence o - type stars in ob associations show hard thermal x - ray emissions of @xmath112  kev ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "intense 6.7  kev line emissions are confirmed from such sources ( @xcite , ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "early - type sources are extremely rare compared to late - type sources in number , but their overwhelmingly large luminosity can be comparable to the integrated luminosity of numerous late - type sources . in the orion nebula cluster , for instance ,",
    "an o6v star ( @xmath12 oric ) alone accounts for @xmath034% of the total hard - band x - ray emission integrated over the entire chandra field of view containing @xmath131000 ysos @xcite    early - type stars become even brighter in x - rays when they evolve off the main - sequence track .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) comprise the brightest x - ray population of thermal point - like sources with a typical hard - band luminosity of @xmath010@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 and a plasma temperature of @xmath142  kev @xcite .",
    "in fact , the brightest stellar x - ray source not powered by accretion reported to date in our galaxy is a wr star of a spectral type of wn78 in the arches cluster ( a1s in @xcite ) .",
    "the source has the 0.210.0  kev luminosity exceeding @xmath010@xmath15  erg  s@xmath6 with a conspicuous 6.7  kev emission .",
    "moreover , the x - ray spectra of these stars commonly show strong metallic emission lines against continuum including the 6.7  kev line , which is a consequence of extreme hydrogen depletion caused by the mass loss and hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "although early - type stars known in the galactic center region are concentrated to the three massive young star clusters  the arches @xcite , the quintuplet @xcite , and the central cluster @xcite  , it is quite natural to expect that a much larger number of early - type stars remain unidentified .",
    "@xcite claimed that the number of young massive star clusters may exceed 50 in the galactic center region .",
    "the inconsistency with the observed value indicates that these clusters are too obscured to be visible in the optical and infrared bands , or that the cluster members are dissipated before the earliest member reaches its end , or that that number is a gross overestimate .",
    "@xcite showed that the strong tidal disruption in the galactic center region makes massive star clusters become unbound on a very short time scale comparable to the lifetime of an o star .",
    "isolated early - type stars may be distributed throughout the region , unlike the other parts of the galaxy where they are found in associations .",

    "the detected point sources account for @xmath90 of the total flux of the 6.7  kev line @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 6.7  kev line of cxogcj174645.3281546 alone accounts for @xmath91% of that of the detected point sources and @xmath92% of that of the total diffuse flux .",
    "such x - ray sources would comprise a substantial fraction of 6.7  kev line - emitting point sources in the galactic center .",
    "1 .   we detected a strong 6.7  kev line with an equivalent width of @xmath01",
    "kev from cxogcj174645.3281546 .",
    "the overall spectrum was very well fitted by a heavily absorbed ( @xmath25@xmath02.4@xmath54  @xmath3 ) 3.8  kev thermal plasma with an iron abundance of @xmath00.8  solar and a luminosity of @xmath0 3@xmath93  erg  s@xmath6 in the 2.08.0kev band , assuming a distance of 8  kpc .",
    "we also analyzed the archived data of chandra and xmm - newton , and found that the x - ray flux spanning @xmath06  years shows year - scale time variability having a factor of @xmath02 .",
    "the probable counterpart in the ir bands is very bright ( @xmath94@xmath95  at 8  kpc ) , and has a cool ( @xmath961000  k ) sed , which is similar to those of the eponymous members of the quintuplet cluster .",
    "4 .   the x - ray spectral and temporal properties and the ir sed are fully consistent with a wc  star+massive  star binary system .",
