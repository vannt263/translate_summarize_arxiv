    "many low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that undergo bright , transient x - ray bursts have been shown to harbor compact objects with masses @xmath83  m@xmath9 ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "these sources are some of the most securely identified black holes known .",
    "such sources are therefore of great interest for future studies of black hole accretion disk physics and general relativity .",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory is well - suited to searching for similar x - ray sources in nearby galaxies . in particular , the bulge of m31 can be entirely searched for bright , transient x - ray events with a single 5 ks observation .",
    "monitoring of m31 by _ chandra _ has shown that such transient sources appear in the m31 bulge about once each month @xcite .",
    "these efforts have been successful in finding dozens of transient sources @xcite .",
    "recently , this monitoring effort has been combined with follow - up @xmath2 observations , and optical counterparts for some transient x - ray sources have been found , placing new constraints on the physical properties of these potential black hole binary systems @xcite . with a sufficient number of optical counterparts , the orbital period distribution of these likely black hole binaries can be determined . this distribution is a fundamental observable parameter that must be matched by any model of binary stellar evolution .    here , we report a bright outburst from an x - ray source in m31 .",
    "@xmath2 imaging prior to , during , and after the outburst reveals no optical sources that exhibited strong variability during the x - ray outburst within the location uncertainty , suggesting that the optical counterpart of the x - ray nova ( xrn ) was fainter than @xmath10 .",
    "section 2 discusses the details of the data , including the reduction and analysis techniques used .",
    "section 3 provides the results of the analysis , and   4 explains the implications of these results . finally , ",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we obtained observations of the m31 bulge with the _ chandra _ acis - i camera on 2004-january-31 ( obsid  4681 ) , 2004-may-23 ( obsid  4682 ) , and 2004-july-17 ( obsid  4719 ) .",
    "observations 4681 and 4682 were guaranteed time observations supplied by s. murray .",
    "all of the data were obtained in `` alternating readout mode '' which reduces event pileup for bright sources but lowers the effective exposure by @xmath11 .",
    "observation 4681 was observed centered on r.a.=00:42:44.4 , dec.=41:16:08.3 with a roll angle of 305.6 degrees for an effective exposure time of 4.09 ks .",
    "observation 4682 was centered on the same coordinates with a roll angle of 80.0 degrees for an effective exposure time of 3.95 ks , and observation 4719 was observed centered on r.a.=00:42:44.3 , dec.=41:16:08.4 with a roll angle of 116.8 degrees for an effective exposure time of 4.12 ks .",
    "these observations were all reduced using the software package ciao v3.1 with the caldb v2.28 .",
    "we created exposure maps for the images using the task _ merge_all _ , and we found and measured positions and fluxes of the sources in the image using the ciao task _",
    "wavdetect_. each data set detected sources down to ( 0.310 kev ) fluxes of @xmath126@xmath410@xmath13 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 or 0.310 kev luminosities of @xmath1210@xmath15 erg s@xmath6 for a typical x - ray binary system in m31 .",
    "we aligned the coordinate system of the x - ray images with the optical images of the local group survey ( lgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "these images have an assigned j2000 ( fk5 ) world coordinate system accurate to @xmath120.25@xmath1 , and they provided the standard coordinate system to which we aligned all of our data for this project .",
    "the positions of x - ray sources with known globular cluster counterparts were aligned with the globular cluster centers in the lgs images using the iraf task _ ccmap _ , allowing adjustments of the pixel scale as well as rotation and shifts in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the alignment had errors of 0.073@xmath1 in r.a . and 0.034@xmath1 in dec . as determined by",
    "ccmap_.    in addition , we measured the position errors for the x - ray sources using the iraf task _ imcentroid _ , which projects the counts from the source onto each axis and calculates the error in the position by dividing the standard deviation of the pixel positions of all of the source counts by the square root of the number of counts .",
    "because the pixels in _ chandra _ images are aligned with north up and east to the left , the x position error was taken to be the r.a .",
    "error , and the y position error was taken to be the dec .",
    "we cross - correlated the x - ray source positions against all previously published x - ray catalogs and the _ simbad _ database to look for any new , bright x - ray source likely to be an x - ray nova ( xrn ) .",
    "herein we focus on one bright source in particular which was detected only in observation 4682 at r.a.=00:42:33.428 , dec.=+41:17:03.37 .",
    "this source was detected once by rosat in 1990 ( [ pfj93 ]  31 ; @xcite ) , but it has not been detected since .",
    "we name this source cxom31  j004233.4 + 411703 , following the naming convention described in @xcite .",
    "we also give this source the short name , r2 - 71 , based on the source position in m31 using the description given in @xcite .",
    "the source is 2.0@xmath18 west and 0.9@xmath18 north of the m31 nucleus .",
    "upper - limits to the x - ray flux at this position in observations 4681 and 4719 were measured by determining the flux necessary to produce a detection 4-@xmath19 above the background flux .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectrum of r2 - 71 from the detection in observation 4682 , which contained 198 counts , using the ciao task _ psextract_. we binned the spectrum in energy so that each bin contained @xmath2010 counts to allow for standard @xmath21 statistics .",
    "we then fit the spectrum using ciao 3.1/sherpa .",
    "two spectral models were fitted to the spectrum : a power - law with absorption and a disk blackbody model with absorption .",
    "the spectrum did not contain sufficient information to provide useful constraints on the foreground absorption .",
    "we therefore fixed the absorption to the typical galactic foreground value ( 6@xmath410@xmath22 @xmath14 ) .",
    "this value provided acceptable fits for both model types .",
    "results are discussed in   3 .",
    "we obtained three sets of _ hst _ acs data .",
    "the first acs image was taken 2004-january-23 in pursuit of another transient source .",
    "this observation was pointed at r.a.=00:42:43.86 , dec.=41:16:30.1 with an orientation of 55 deg , fortuitously containing the location of r2 - 71 in the northern corner of the image even though r2 - 71 had not been detected in any _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the second observation was taken 2004-june-14 .",
    "intended to search for the optical counterpart of r2 - 71 , this observation was pointed at r.a.=00:42:33.39 , dec.=41:17:43.4 with an orientation of 260  deg . the slightly northern pointing was done to avoid a dangerously bright star from landing on the ccd .",
    "the third observation was taken on 2004-august-15 , after the x - ray source had faded .",
    "this observation was pointed at r.a.=00:42:41.5 , dec.=41:17:00.0 with an orientation of 220 deg in order to pursue another transient source in the field .",
    "all three observations were taken using the standard acs box 4-point dither pattern to recover the highest possible spatial resolution .",
    "all exposures were taken through the f435w filter .",
    "the total exposure times were 2200 seconds for each data set .",
    "we aligned and drizzled each set of 4 images into high - resolution ( 0.025@xmath1 pixel@xmath6 ) images using the pyraf task _ multidrizzle _ , which has been optimized to process acs imaging data .",
    "the task removes cosmic ray events and geometric distortions , and it combines the dithered frames together into one final photometric image .    we aligned the @xmath2 images to the lgs coordinate system with _",
    "ccmap _ using stars common to both data sets .",
    "the resulting alignment had rms errors of 0.04@xmath1 ( less than 1 acs pixel ) .",
    "the consistency of this alignment can be seen by the excellent agreement between the resulting coordinate systems of the three @xmath2 images , each independently aligned with the lgs coordinate system , shown in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "we processed the relevant sections of the final images with daophot  ii and allstar @xcite to obtain photometry for the resolved stars within the error circle of the x - ray transient .",
    "this region is extremely crowded with stars at only 2.2@xmath18 from the m31 nucleus .",
    "the faintest source visible in the error circles in the images shown in figure  [ ims ] is @xmath23 ; the brightest is @xmath24 ( on the northeast rim of the circle ) .",
    "we subtracted the images taken before and after the x - ray nova from the 2004-june-14 observation , during which the x - ray source was likely to be active . prior to subtraction ,",
    "the images were transformed to have pixels aligned in north - up , east - left orientation .",
    "these transformations were performed with the iraf tasks _ geomap _ and _ geotran_. the relevant sections of the subtracted images are shown in figure  [ diff ] .",
    "the three x - ray images from our @xmath25 observations are shown in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "these images clearly show r2 - 71 detected only in the 2004-may-23 observation .",
    "this detection had a 0.310 kev flux of ( 1.7@xmath00.1@xmath2610@xmath27 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 .",
    "the previous observation and following observation had 4@xmath19 upper limits of @xmath71.4@xmath410@xmath28 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 .",
    "the second upper limit shows that the source decayed by a factor of at least 12 in 55 days .",
    "therefore the @xmath29-folding decay time of r2 - 71 was @xmath3022 days .",
    "the non - detection of this source in the survey of @xcite provides a 0.37 kev flux upper limit of @xmath78@xmath410@xmath31 photons @xmath14 s@xmath6 , showing that the source changed in flux by more than a factor of 100 .",
    "therefore r2 - 71 is certainly a transient x - ray source in m31 .",
    "the errors in the centroid determination of the x - ray source were 0.08@xmath1 in r.a . and 0.10@xmath1 in declination .",
    "we added these errors in quadrature to the errors in the alignment of the x - ray and optical images ( 0.073@xmath1 in r.a . and 0.034@xmath1 in declination ) to obtain the final ( 1@xmath19 ) position errors of 0.11@xmath1 and 0.11@xmath1 in r.a . and",
    "declination respectively .",
    "these errors resulted in the 2@xmath19 error circle shown in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of r2 - 71 was well - fitted by both the power - law and the disk - blackbody models .",
    "fortunately , both of these fits give the same measurement for the absorption - corrected 0.37 kev flux and the corresponding 0.37 kev luminosity .",
    "the best - fitting power - law has a slope of 1.5@xmath00.1 with @xmath32=17.87/17 ( probability = 0.40 ) .",
    "this fit yields an unabsorbed 0.37 kev flux of ( @xmath33)@xmath410@xmath34 erg @xmath14 s@xmath6 .",
    "the best fitting disk blackbody has an inner disk temperature of kt=1.4@xmath00.2 kev , an inner disk radius of @xmath35 km with a @xmath36 ( probability=0.50 ) .",
    "the resulting unabsorbed 0.37 kev flux is ( @xmath37)@xmath410@xmath34 erg @xmath14 s@xmath6 .    assuming a distance to m31 of 780 kpc @xcite , the results are both consistent with the x - ray luminosity of ( 3.9@xmath00.4)@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 obtained from the power - law fit , similar to the luminosity seen in the 1990 rosat data by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of r2 - 71 is in the normal range of m31 x - ray transients as measured by williams et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , with hardness ratios of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where s , m , and h represent the number of counts detected in the energy ranges 0.31.0 , 1.02.0 , and 2.07.0 kev , respectively .",
    "gaussian errors were measured for the background - subtracted number of counts in each energy bin with the ciao task _",
    "dmextract_.      analysis of the optical data initially provided a few possible variable stars within the r2 - 71 error circle .",
    "we scrutinized each possibility through aperture photometry , completeness tests , and difference imaging .",
    "the results show no strong detection of optical variability and provide an upper - limit to the @xmath3 magnitude of any highly variable counterpart to r2 - 71 .",
    "the region of interest for all three of our optical observations is shown in the images in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "the daophot ii output revealed one star in the error circle that was significantly brighter in the 2004-june-14 observation , when the x - ray source was most likely active .",
    "the star at r.a.=00:42:33.414 , decl.=41:17:03.47 , was measured to have @xmath40 in the 2004-june-14 observation .",
    "daophot ii failed to find this star in the 2004-january-23 observation . because inspection of the 2004-january-23 image reveals a source at this location , this non - detection was likely due to the effects of the bright neighboring star 0.05@xmath1 to the southeast .",
    "aperture photometry of the location in the 2004-january-23 observation with a 0.075@xmath1 radius aperture yields @xmath41 .",
    "daophot ii measured the star to be @xmath42 in the 2004-august-15 observation .",
    "therefore according to the standard errors an increase in brightness during the 2004-june-14 at the 4@xmath19 confidence level occurred ; however , the standard errors do not take into account the uncertainty introduced by the close brighter neighbor .",
    "any added uncertainty due to crowding would decrease the significance of this brightness increase .",
    "in addition to this suspicious counterpart candidate , there were 2 fainter stars detected by daophot ii in the error circle of the 2004-june-14 observation that were not detected in the other 2 observations , when the x - ray source was not active .",
    "these stars had @xmath3 magnitudes of 26.6@xmath00.2 and 26.7@xmath00.2 in the 2004-june-14 observation .",
    "these stars may not have been detected in the other observations because crowding issues caused our photometry to be incomplete at these faint magnitudes .",
    "we determined the completeness of the optical data in the area of r2 - 71 by comparing the daophot ii output from the 2004-june-14 observation to those of the 2004-august-15 observation .",
    "figure  [ comp ] shows two histograms .",
    "the solid histogram shows the percentage of stars detected by the daophot analysis in the 2004-june-14 observation within 3@xmath1 of the center of the error circle but not detected by the same analysis in the 2004-august-15 observation .",
    "the dotted histogram shows the percentage of stars detected by the daophot analysis in the 2004-august-15 observation within 3@xmath1 of the center of the error circle but not detected by the same analysis in the 2004-june-14 observation .",
    "the number of lost stars begins to increase at @xmath10 , suggesting that the completeness of the data begins to decrease at that magnitude , most likely due to the crowding in this dense region of m31 .",
    "this result is consistent with the failure of daophot ii to detect the @xmath43 star in the error circle in the 2004-january-23 observation , even though there appears to be emission at that location in the image in figure  [ ims ] .",
    "therefore all of the variable candidates in the r2 - 71 error circle are attributable to crowding and completeness issues , as they are all fainter than @xmath10 .",
    "the lack of any strong variability detection within the r2 - 71 error circle is confirmed with the difference images shown in figure  [ diff ] .",
    "the most variable location in the difference images is marked with arrows ; this variability is not statistically significant .",
    "the daophot analysis did not measure a brightness increase for this star in the 2004-june-14 data . as a second check for a possible brightness increase , we performed aperture photometry of the location in all three observations with a 0.1@xmath1 radius aperture .",
    "the location had @xmath44 in the 2004-june-14 observation and @xmath45 in the other observations ( @xmath46 ) , showing variability of only 1.5@xmath19 .",
    "we discounted this low - significance peak in the difference image as a counterpart candidate for r2 - 71 .",
    "concisely , no variable star inside the error circle of r2 - 71 was found other than suspicious daophot detections affected by crowding and completeness .",
    "therefore , we were unable to identify the optical counterpart to r2 - 71 ; however , our completeness results suggest that any highly variable counterpart must have had @xmath47 during the 2004-june-14 @xmath2 observation .",
    "our search of the literature found one previous detection of r2 - 71 in 1990 .",
    "the detection was in only one rosat observation ( source 31 in @xcite ) , and the lack of detections of outbursts of this source before or since @xcite helps to constrain the duty cycle of this system .",
    "m31 was observed by _",
    "einstein _ in the summers and winters of 1979 and 1980 @xcite and by rosat in the summers of 1990 @xcite , 1991 @xcite , 1992 @xcite , 1994 , and 1995 .",
    "we searched the rosat _ hri _ images of the m31 bulge taken in the summers of 1994 and 1995 and found no detections of r2 - 71 .",
    "it was therefore detected only once in about 9 months of monitoring spanning 7 years before _",
    "chandra_. these observations constrain the duty cycle of the source to be @xmath480.1 , since a larger duty cycle would have allowed more than one detection in these early data sets .    now , in 2004 , r2 - 71 has been seen for the first time in about 5 years of _ chandra _ monitoring , going back to late 1999 @xcite . assuming the 1990 outburst also lasted @xmath121 month ,",
    "the source has been active for at least 2 months of a 14 year timespan , providing a lower limit on its duty cycle of @xmath80.01 . adding the @xmath128 months per year for 5 years of _ chandra _ monitoring to the 9 months of monitoring before _",
    "chandra _ implies 2 months of activity in @xmath1249 months of monitoring , or a duty cycle of @xmath120.04 .",
    "therefore , our best estimate of the duty cycle of r2 - 71 is @xmath120.04 , and it can be reliably constrained to the range 0.010.1 .",
    "the _ hst _ data provide indirect evidence that r2 - 71 is an lmxb .",
    "this preliminary classification allows us to predict the range in which the orbital period of the system will fall assuming the system is similar to galactic lmxb transient systems .",
    "the @xmath2 data set rules against the possibility that the x - ray source is an hmxb .",
    "even the brightest star in the error circle of r2 - 71 has @xmath24 , which implies m@xmath49 ( assuming @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "even so , this @xmath3-band luminosity is fainter than massive o and b type stars .",
    "furthermore , this brightest star is not considered a counterpart candidate because it did not show significant variability . because r2 - 71 is not an hmxb",
    ", we continue under the assumption that it is an lmxb .",
    "van paradijs & mcclintock ( 1994 ) identified an empirical correlation between the optical / x - ray luminosity ratios of lmxbs in outburst and their orbital periods .",
    "their model assumes that the optical emission arises from x - ray heating of the accretion disk .",
    "larger disks form in longer period systems and glow brighter in the optical than smaller disks",
    ". in this model , the faint upper - limit on the optical brightness of r2 - 71 would suggest that it is a small accretion disk system with a short orbital period .",
    "counter - examples to the correlation exist , like xte  j1118 + 480 @xcite ; however , such counter - examples usually stand out as odd in other ways . for example",
    ", xte  j1118 + 480 was fainter and harder than typical xrne .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of the prediction , we assume that r2 - 71 is an xrn similar to the many galactic lmxb transient events that fit the correlation well .",
    "a few of these are described in detail below .",
    "we checked the applicability of the correlation to the specific case of our data because our x - ray and optical data are not precisely contemporaneous .",
    "if the errors in the correlation and optical luminosity are taken into account , our investigations show that the correlation provides reliable period range predictions for both `` classical '' and more recently discovered galactic xrne , even if the optical luminosity is measured 3 weeks after the x - ray luminosity .",
    "first , we checked the application of the correlation to `` classical '' galactic xrne , those with smooth exponential decays ( e.g. a0620 - 00 , nova mus , gro  0422 + 32 , etc . ) .",
    "these types of events have optical decay timescales that average @xmath122.2 times longer than their x - ray decay timescales @xcite .",
    "for example , a0620 - 00 has an @xmath29-folding optical decay time of @xmath1275 days and an x - ray decay time of @xmath1225 days @xcite , so that its optical flux decreases by 25% in 3 weeks , for a 0.3 mag change .",
    "such an effect is small compared to the large dynamic range of the correlation , which covers 8 optical magnitudes and 3 orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the x - ray flux of a0620 in outburst was @xmath1250 crab @xcite , which translates to @xmath128@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 at the appropriate distance ( 1.05@xmath00.40 kpc ; @xcite ) . applying the 75 day optical decay time to the peak optical magnitude",
    "( @xmath52 ; @xcite ) , a0620 was @xmath53 three weeks after peak .",
    "assuming an extinction of @xmath54 @xcite , m@xmath55=0.2@xmath00.9 at that time .",
    "the orbital period prediction from these values is 0.8@xmath56 days , which is consistent with the known period of 0.3 days @xcite .",
    "similar results are seen when the correlation is applied to other classical systems , including , for example , 4u  1543 - 47 @xcite .",
    "the predicted period range is therefore reliable for classical xrne even if the optical observation is 3 weeks after the x - ray observation .",
    "in addition , the correlation even holds for several more recent x - ray transient sources that have exhibited complex light curves , such as gro  j1655 - 40 and xte  1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "we tested the effects of the 3 week interval between the x - ray and optical observations of r2 - 71 on our period prediction using the complicated optical and x - ray lightcurves of the recent xrn xte  j1550 - 564 .",
    "inspection of the lightcurves of @xcite suggests that if we observed xte  j1550 - 564 @xmath128 days after its x - ray peak , when its x - ray luminosity was @xmath124@xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ( for a distance of 5.3@xmath02.3 kpc ; @xcite ) , and then observed the location in the optical 3 weeks later , we would have seen the counterpart at @xmath57 .",
    "applying an extinction of @xmath58 @xcite implies m@xmath59 .",
    "putting these numbers into the empirical correlation provides a period prediction of @xmath60 days .",
    "if we were fortunate enough to catch the brightest x - ray flare , with a flux of 1.6@xmath410@xmath31 erg @xmath14 s@xmath6 @xcite , the source luminosity would have been l@xmath6110@xmath62 erg s@xmath6 . in this case",
    ", we would have measured @xmath63 three weeks later @xcite , 0.9 mag fainter than the peak of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the later optical measurement would have yielded m@xmath65 and a period prediction of @xmath66 days .",
    "the actual period of xte  j1550 - 564 is 1.55 days @xcite , within the predicted range .",
    "succinctly , the _ hst _ data show that r2 - 71 is not an hmxb , and therefore may be an lmxb .",
    "the @xcite correlation provides reliable orbital period range predictions for such objects even when the observations are separated by 3 weeks and the relation is applied to a complex transient lightcurve .",
    "we therefore apply the correlation to our measurements of r2 - 71 under the assumption that , as in the above galactic examples , the errors in absolute @xmath67 magnitude and in the correlation are sufficient to account for complications in the lightcurve and the 3-week gap between x - ray and optical observations .",
    "we note that these predictions rely on the assumption that r2 - 71 behaves in a similar way to many galactic xrne .",
    "our @xmath3-band brightness upper - limit of @xmath47 , from our completeness results , can be converted to a @xmath67-band luminosity by assuming the same foreground extinction we assumed for the x - ray spectral fit and converting to optical extinction using the relation of @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath50 , m@xmath68 . then using the mean @xmath69 colors of galactic lmxbs in the @xcite catalog ( -0.09 + /-",
    "0.14 ) , m@xmath70 . placing this upper - limit on the optical luminosity and our 0.37 kev x - ray luminosity of 3.9 @xmath71 erg s@xmath6 into the @xcite correlation , including their quoted errors",
    ", we obtain a prediction for the period of the lmxb system r2 - 71 of @xmath72 days .",
    "we have constrained the x - ray and optical properties of a repeating x - ray transient source in the m31 bulge , which we have named cxom31  j004233.4 + 411703 or r2 - 71 .",
    "this source has undergone at least two x - ray outbursts brighter than 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 in the past two decades .",
    "previous x - ray observations reveal that the source has varied by at least a factor of 100 in x - ray luminosity , and our _ chandra _ monitoring program shows that the outburst in may of 2004 had an @xmath29-folding decay time of less than a month .",
    "the observed activity of the source from 1979 to the present suggests that it has a duty cycle of 0.04@xmath73 .",
    "optical observations of the location of r2 - 71 with @xmath2 acs before , during , and after the x - ray outburst show no clear optical counterpart to this transient x - ray event in the m31 bulge .",
    "the stellar content of the region rules out the presence of an hmxb transient system at the location of r2 - 71 .",
    "we therefore assume r2 - 71 is an lmxb system .",
