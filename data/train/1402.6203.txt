    "atomic nuclei in the actinide region are believed to be synthesized in explosive stellar environments purely by the rapid neutron - capture process .",
    "therefore , to predict their abundances found on earth  @xcite , one has to know the various reaction rates for all isotopes including the ones with extreme neutron excess .",
    "reaction rates are also vital for the modeling of future and existing nuclear reactors  @xcite .",
    "it is particularly important to ensure a reliable extrapolation in cases where measured data are insufficient or lacking .",
    "the @xmath5np isotope with a half - life of 2.14 million years is one of the main constituents in nuclear spent fuel . in the former us high - level waste repository in the yucca mountain , nevada ,",
    "about 40 tons of @xmath5np are stored  @xcite , and it is of great interest to find methods for transmuting this type of radioactive waste . in order to obtain high transmutation efficiency , the neutron fission - to - capture ratio should be determined for the particular isotope as function of neutron energy . hence , accurate fission and capture cross sections are necessary to make reliable predictions  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear level density and @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) are important inputs in statistical hauser - feshbach reaction - rate calculations .",
    "these functions describe the average properties of excited nuclei in the quasi - continuum region , where the number of levels is too high to study individual states and their transitions . here , the oslo method  @xcite has been shown to be an excellent tool to determine simultaneously the level density and the @xmath0-ray strength function ( @xmath0sf ) .",
    "recently , the oslo method was applied to the @xmath7th , @xmath8pa and @xmath9u isotopes  @xcite .",
    "the level densities of all eight actinides follow closely the constant - temperature level density formula .",
    "furthermore , a large scissors resonance ( sr ) was observed in the @xmath0sf with a @xmath0-energy centroid at @xmath10 mev .",
    "this extra @xmath0 strength enhances the decay with @xmath0 rays relative to other decay branches such as particle emission or fission .",
    "one would expect that the sr is present throughout the region of well - deformed actinides .",
    "the n_tof collaboration  @xcite has recently reported on @xmath11 experiments on the @xmath12u , @xmath5np and @xmath13pu isotopes .",
    "they verify a low - energy structure in @xmath14u and @xmath15pu , but not in @xmath1np , a result which is rather surprising .",
    "the odd - odd @xmath1np nucleus has the same gross properties as other actinides , and the oslo group has confirmed that the structure also appears in the odd - odd @xmath16pa nucleus  @xcite .",
    "thus , the n_tof results on @xmath1np have triggered us to investigate this case further .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to search for the sr in @xmath1np and to determine the total level density and @xmath0sf .",
    "furthermore , we present for the first time @xmath17 ) cross - section from hauser - feshbach calculations using the measured level density and @xmath0sf as inputs .",
    "the calculations are compared with known @xmath17 ) data from literature .",

    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the experiment was performed with the mc-35 scanditronix cyclotron at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) . the @xmath5np target ( thickness 0.200 mg/@xmath18 and enrichment 99% ) , which had a carbon backing ( thickness 0.020 mg/@xmath18 ) , was bombarded with a 13.5 mev deuteron beam .",
    "particle-@xmath0 coincidences were measured with the siri particle telescope and the cactus @xmath0-detector system  @xcite .",
    "the 64 siri telescopes were placed in backward direction covering eight angles from @xmath19 to @xmath20 relative to the beam axis .",
    "this configuration was chosen to reduce the intense elastically scattered deuterons and to obtain a broad and rather high spin distribution that matches better to the spin distribution of available states in the quasi - continuum .",
    "the front and back detectors have thicknesses of @xmath21  @xmath22 m and @xmath23  @xmath22 m , respectively .",
    "the cactus array consists of 28 collimated @xmath24 nai(tl ) detectors with a total efficiency of @xmath25% at @xmath26  mev .",
    "the @xmath27 back detectors were used as master gates and the start for the time - to - digital - converter ( tdc ) .",
    "one or more of the nai detectors were used as individual tdc stops . in this way ,",
    "prompt particle-@xmath0 coincidences with background subtraction could be sorted event by event .",
    "the proton events were selected by setting proper 2-dimensional gates on the 64 @xmath28e - e matrices . from the kinematics of the reaction ,",
    "the proton energies deposited in the telescopes were translated into initial excitation energy @xmath27 in the residual @xmath1np nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : matrix ] shows the first main steps of the oslo method . after sorting the data into a raw matrix of initial excitation energy versus the nai energy signal ( a ) , the matrix is unfolded  @xcite using the nai response function for each excitation bin ( b ) . in panel ( c ) the first - generation ( primary ) @xmath0-ray matrix @xmath29 is shown . here",
    ", an iterative subtraction technique was applied to separate out the distribution of the first - generation @xmath0s from the total @xmath0 cascade  @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on the assumption that the @xmath0 distribution is the same whether the levels were populated directly by the nuclear reaction or by @xmath0 decay from higher - lying states .",
    "this assumption is necessarily fulfilled when states have the same relative probability to be populated by the two processes , since @xmath0-branching ratios are properties of the levels themselves .",
    "the first generation matrix @xmath30 is built from the total matrix @xmath31 of fig .

    ", the decay seems to reveal a statistical behavior . to proceed with the oslo method , we use only the region @xmath43 mev of the first generation matrix of fig .  [ fig : matrix ] ( c ) .",
    "the experimental data are normalized to the level density of known discrete levels at low excitation energy @xmath27 ( red solid line ) and the level density extracted from known neutron resonance spacings @xmath44 at the neutron separation energy @xmath45 .",

    "according to the brink hypothesis  @xcite , the @xmath0-ray transmission coefficient @xmath49 is approximately independent of excitation energy .",
