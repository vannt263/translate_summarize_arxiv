    "modular forms and related objects have series expansions which typically are normalized so that the initial coefficient is  @xmath0 , making the second coefficient the first instance containing useful information .",
    "we present data which show that , for several families of objects , the `` smallest '' members in the family tend to have a negative second coefficient . here",
    "`` smallest '' refers to a natural ordering of the family .",
    "these observations seem surprising at first , because when averaged over the family , the second coefficient has a known ( or conjectured ) distribution @xcite which is equally likely to be positive or negative .",
    "the explanation lies in the fact that we can associate an l - function to each object in the family , and we describe a general principle which says that the `` first '' l - function in a family is likely to have a negative second dirichlet coeffcient .",
    "that principle is a straightforward application of weil s explicit formula .",
    "there is a substantial literature on bounding the location of the first negative coefficient of modular forms and other objects @xcite .",
    "the situation we discuss here , in which a negative coefficient appears as soon as possible , should be viewed as a transient phenomenon , and not related to the general question of the oscillation of fourier coefficients .    in section  [ sec : data ] we provide data on the first few coefficients of holomorphic cusp forms on hecke congruence groups , as well as elliptic curves of higher rank . in many cases ,",
    "the first nontrivial coefficient is negative . in section",
    "[ sec : explicit ] we make the argument that the associated to the objects are responsible for this phenomenon and we use the explicit formula to justify that conclusion .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight  @xmath2 for the hecke congruence group  @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 denote the subspace of newforms .",
    "the newform space has a distinguished basis of simultaneous eigenfunctions of the hecke operators and atkin - lehner operators .",
    "the newforms have a fourier expansion @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "a standard reference on this material is iwaniec s book  @xcite .",
    "@xmath7    table  [ fig : gl2 ] provides information about the dimension of the space  @xmath4 and the signs of the fourier coefficient @xmath8 of the newform basis . from table",
    "[ fig : gl2 ] , one can see that if @xmath2 and @xmath9 are both small , then @xmath4 is trivial , and the dimension of @xmath4 grows regularly as a function of @xmath2 , and irregularly as a function of  @xmath9 .",
    "these facts are well known .",
    "but what was previously not observed , and seems surprising at first , is that for most of the newforms which are on the border of the non - zero spaces , @xmath8 is negative .",
    "the negativity of these coefficients is not a coincidence : they arise from a simple principle involving l - functions which we describe in section  [ sec : lfunctions ] .",
    "while not included in table  [ fig : gl2 ] , we note that the second coefficient is negative for @xmath10 for all @xmath11 . that is , there are four more @xmath12 along the top row before the first @xmath13 appears .",
    "while this may also seem surprising , it turns out to have a similar explanation , which we give in section  [ sec : small weight ] .",
    "tables of elliptic curves@xmath14 have both inspired and benefitted from significant theoretical work . as of this writing , all elliptic curves of conductor less than 350,000 have been tabulated by john cremona , and detailed information about them is available in the l - functions and modular forms database ( lmfdb )  @xcite .",
    "an issue is how to label elliptic curves .",
    "the goal is staightforward : each curve should be given a label which specifies its conductor , its isogeny class , and the isomorphism class within the isogeny class .",
    "the conductor is an integer , so there is no ambiguity .",
    "the order in which to list the isogeny classes , however , requires a choice , as does the order for listing the curves within an isogeny class .",
    "various methods for ordering the isogeny classes have been used , and until recently the `` cremona label '' has been the standard .",
    "unfortunately , the cremona label is difficult to describe , and in some cases can not be derived from first principles .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "these shortcomings have been addressed by a new labeling scheme , also developed by john cremona , referred to as the `` lmfdb label . '' for example , the elliptic curve @xmath15 has lmfdb label `` 672.e2 '' .",
    "that specific label means :    * @xmath16 has conductor 672 , * when the newforms with rational integer coefficients in @xmath17 are ordered lexicographically by their fourier coefficients , the form associated to @xmath16 appears 5th on the list ( because `` e '' is the 5th letter ) , and * when the elliptic curves in the isogeny class of @xmath16 are put in minimal weierstrass form @xmath18 then @xmath16 appears 2nd when the @xmath19 $ ] are ordered lexicographically .    note",
    "that the modularity @xcite of ellipic curves@xmath14 is necessary to ensure that each curve has an lmfdb label .",
    "one of the interesting properties of an elliptic curve is its _ rank _ , which is the rank of the mordell - weil group @xmath20 of rational points on @xmath16 .",
    "the rank of an elliptic curve is the subject of the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture , which equates the rank with the order of vanishing of the l - function @xmath21 at the critical point @xmath22 .",
    "table  [ tab : ecrank ] shows the lmfdb label for the isogeny classes of the first few elliptic curves of rank  1 , along with the number of isogeny classes with that conductor .",
    "note that we give the label of an isogeny class , not an elliptic curve , because all the curves in an isogeny class have the same rank .",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24    for the entries in table  [ tab : ecrank ] where there is a single isogeny class of a given conductor , then of course that class has to be given the label `` @xmath25 . ''",
    "but what seems surprising at first is that even when there are other isogeny classes , the entries in table  [ tab : ecrank ] almost all have the label `` @xmath25 . ''",
    "in fact , the first 11 times there was a rank 1 curve and also another isogeny class with that same conductor , the rank 1 isogeny class is given the label `` @xmath25 . ''",
    "that seems highly unlikely , considering that the labeling scheme does not appear to have any reference to the rank .    in table",
    "[ tab : ecrank2 ] we give the labels and the number of isogeny classes with a given conductor , for the first few elliptic curves of rank 2 .",
    "we have omitted those cases where there is only one isogeny class with that conductor , such as the first case of rank  2 : @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27    as in the first 11 entries of table  [ tab : ecrank ] , every curve in table  [ tab : ecrank2 ] has isogeny class `` @xmath25 . ''",
    "in fact , this phenomenon for rank 2 continues until conductor 1147 , where isogeny class `` @xmath28 '' has rank  2 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for rank  3 , which the interested reader can explore in the lmfdb .",
    "we will see that this has a similar explanation to our previous observations .",
    "all the observations in section  [ sec : data ] have the same underlying cause : all are consequences of the following general principle :          by an _ @xmath29-function _ , we mean a dirichlet series with a functional equation and an euler product .",
    "furthermore , we assume the ramanujan - petersson conjecture and the generalized riemann hypothesis .",
    "this means that we can write the @xmath29-function as a dirichlet series @xmath30 where @xmath31 for any @xmath32 , which has an euler product @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a polynomial , and the product is over the primes . as is usual in the theory of l - functions",
    ", @xmath35 is a complex variable .",
    "we assume the dirichlet coefficients are real , so the l - function satisfies a functional equation which can be written in the form @xmath36 here @xmath37 and we assume that @xmath38 and  @xmath39 . the number @xmath40 is called the _ degree _ of the @xmath29-function , which for all but finitely many @xmath41 is also the degree of the polynomial  @xmath34 .",
    "the l - functions associated to the arithmetic objects considered in this paper are conjectured to satisfy the ramanujan - petersson bound , which asserts that the polynomials @xmath34 have all their zeros on or outside the unit circle , so the dirichlet coefficients actually satisfy the more precise bound @xmath42 have the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "[ lem : weil ] suppose that @xmath45 has a dirichlet series expansion which continues to an entire function such that @xmath46 is entire and satisfies the mild growth condition @xmath47 for some @xmath48 , uniformly in @xmath49 for bounded  @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be an even function which is holomorphic in a horizontal strip @xmath52 with @xmath53 in this region , and suppose that @xmath54 is real - valued for real @xmath55 .",
    "suppose also that the fourier transform of @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 is such that @xmath58 converges absolutely , where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 then @xmath61 where @xmath62 and the sum @xmath63 runs over all non - trivial zeroes of @xmath45 .",
    "[ thm : meta ] fix non - negative real numbers @xmath64 in .",
    "there exist real numbers @xmath65 such that if @xmath66 then there do not exist any l - functions with functional equation   satisfying the ramanujan bound   and the riemann hypothesis . and if @xmath67 then any l - function satisfying those three conditions must have @xmath68 .    in other words , if an l - function is just barely able to exist , meaning that the parameter @xmath69 in its functional equation is only slightly larger than the minimum threshold imposed by the @xmath70 , then it must have a negative second dirichlet coefficient .      in the explicit formula ,",
    "choose the function @xmath71 the key properties we require are that @xmath56 is non - negative , and the support of @xmath72 contains @xmath73 but not @xmath74 for any integer @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the sum on the left side is non - negative , and the sum over @xmath78 is a constant depending on the @xmath70 and our choice of @xmath56 .",
    "the ramanujan bound on the dirichlet coefficients gives us a bound on @xmath79 , coming from the simple fact that for @xmath41 prime , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath41th dirichlet coefficient of the l - function .",
    "thus , if @xmath69 is sufficiently small then the right side must be negative , which is a contradiction . that proves the existence of the number @xmath82 . and if @xmath69 is slightly larger , then the only way for the right side to be non - negative is if @xmath83 is positive ; this is equivalent to @xmath8 being negative .",
    "that proves the existence of the number @xmath84 .    to complete our explanation of the prevalence of @xmath85 for cusp forms on the edge of existence",
    ", we note that for the l - functions associated to @xmath86 , the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath87 in the functional equation are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 . applying theorem  [ thm : meta ] with @xmath2 fixed",
    ", we see that if @xmath9 is sufficiently small then @xmath4 must be empty , and if @xmath9 is slightly larger and @xmath4 is nonempty , then @xmath85 .    for the elliptic curves of higher rank , we note",
    "that , according to the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture , the l - function of a rank @xmath90 elliptic curve has an order @xmath90 zero at the critical point .",
    "this translates to @xmath90 zeros with @xmath91 in  .",
    "those @xmath91 terms add a large positive contribution to the left side of , equivalently .",
    "the lower bound on possible levels @xmath92 for a rank @xmath90 elliptic curve is an increasing function of @xmath90 . and just as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : meta ] ,",
    "those @xmath69 which are slightly larger than the minimum must be accompanied by a negative value for @xmath8 . finally , since the isogeny classes of elliptic curves are ordered lexicographically by the l - function ( equivalently , modular form ) coefficients , those with a negative @xmath8 are more likely to be listed first , receiving `` a '' as the label of their isogeny class .      for the larger weights in table  [ fig : gl2 ] , the @xmath85 phenomenon only persists for a small strip around the edge of the region where the cusp forms are able to exist . however , for weight @xmath93 we find that @xmath85 for all @xmath11 .",
    "this also has a simple explanation coming from the explicit formula .    for a weight @xmath2 cusp form ,",
    "the parameters @xmath94 in the functional equation are @xmath95 . in figure",
    "[ fig : digamma ] we plot the factor @xmath96\\ ] ] which occurs in the @xmath97 term in the explicit formula , , for various @xmath87 .      in the integrand of ,",
    "the function in figure  [ fig : digamma ] is multiplied by @xmath101 , which is positive and has most of its support near @xmath102 .",
    "therefore the integrand is mostly negative when the weight @xmath2 is small , so the contribution of @xmath97 to the right side of the explicit formula will be negative .",
    "thus , for small @xmath2 the value of @xmath103 must be larger in order for the right side of the explicit formula to be non - negative .",
    "and as before , for @xmath69 slightly above the threshold value it is necessary for @xmath8 to be negative .",
    "let @xmath104 be the negative amount which @xmath8 could contribute to the right side .",
    "since it is @xmath105 that contributes to the right side , one needs @xmath105 to increase by @xmath106 before it is possible for @xmath8 to be positive .",
    "but if @xmath69 is larger , as it must be if @xmath2 is small , then @xmath105 increases more slowly , so one requires a larger increase in @xmath69 to increase @xmath105 by  @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests that if @xmath2 is small , once @xmath69 is large enough for the curve ( or the l - function ) to possibly exist , there is a wider range of @xmath69 values which require @xmath8 to be negative . that explains the large number of @xmath12 at the top of table  [ fig : gl2 ] .",
    "it is a curious phenomenon that elliptic curves of a given rank tend to appear with conductors that are only slightly larger ( on a logarithmic scale ) than the minimum forced upon them by the explicit formula .",
    "this means that many of the initial coefficients , and not just @xmath8 , must be negative .",
    "this fact imparts some surprising properties on the l - functions .",
