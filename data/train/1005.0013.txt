    "anderson localization is a paradigm in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "it consists in a blockade of the diffusive electronic transport in disordered metals due to interferences of multiply scattered de broglie waves at low temperatures and at a sufficiently strong disorder .",
    "this phenomenon is not unique to electrons but can manifest itself for any wave in the presence of disorder , in particular for classical waves , such as light and sound @xcite , and , as shown more recently , for matter waves @xcite .",
    "although the absence of decoherence and interactions @xcite for classical waves is appealing in the context of the original idea of anderson , serious complications appear due to absorption of a part of the wave energy by the disordered medium @xcite . extracting clear signatures of anderson localization from experimental signals that are strongly affected by  often a poorly controlled  absorption was the key to success in recent experiments with microwaves @xcite , light @xcite and ultrasound @xcite .",
    "classical waves offer a unique possibility of performing angle- , space- , time- or frequency - resolved measurements with excellent resolution , the possibility that was not available in the realm of electronic transport . in a wider perspective",
    ", they also allow a controlled study of the interplay between disorder and interactions , as illustrated by the recent work on disordered photonic lattices @xcite .",
    "interpretation of measurements requires a theory that would be able to describe not only the genuine interferences taking place in the bulk of a large sample but also the modification of these interferences in a sample of particular shape , of finite size , and with some precise conditions at the boundaries .",
    "such a theory has been recently developed @xcite based on the self - consistent ( sc ) theory of vollhardt and wlfle @xcite .",
    "the new ingredient is the position dependence of the renormalized diffusion coefficient @xmath3 that accounts for a stronger impact of interference effects in the bulk of the disordered sample as compared to the regions adjacent to boundaries .",
    "this position dependence is crucial in open disordered media @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 also appears in the supersymmetry approach to wave transport @xcite , which confirms that this concept goes beyond a particular technique ( diagrammatic or supersymmetry methods ) used in the calculations .    the sc theory with a position - dependent diffusion coefficient was successfully applied to analyze microwave @xcite and ultrasonic @xcite experiments .",
    "the predictions of the theory @xcite are also in qualitative agreement with optical experiments of strzer _ et al .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the position dependence of @xmath4 is just a ( useful ) mathematical concept or if it is a genuine physical reality .",
    "in addition , the extent to which predictions of sc theory are quantitatively correct is not known . obviously , the last issue is particularly important once comparison with experiments is attempted .    in the present paper",
    "we compare the predictions of sc theory of localization with the known results obtained previously using the supersymmetry method @xcite and with the results of extensive _ ab - initio _ numerical simulations of wave transport in two - dimensional ( 2d ) disordered waveguides .",
    "we demonstrate , first , that the position - dependent diffusion is a physical reality and , second , that sc theory agrees with the supersymmetry approach up to terms of the order of @xmath0 ( with with @xmath1 the dimensionless conductance in the absence of interference effects ) and with numerical simulation at least for @xmath2 . in the latter case , the agreement is found even in the presence of absorption .",

    "this was not obvious _ a priori _ because of the numerous approximations involved in the derivation of self - consistent equations @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and numerical simulations is good in the presence of absorption as well , which has a particular importance in the context of the recent quest for anderson localization of classical waves that heavily relies on confrontation of experimental results with the self - consistent theory @xcite .",
    "deep in the localized regime ( @xmath146 ) , the self - consistent theory loses its quantitative accuracy , but still yields qualitatively correct results ( exponential decay of conductance with the length of the waveguide and of the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 with the distance from waveguide boundaries ) .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to see if the ability of the self - consistent theory to provide quantitative predictions still holds in three - dimensional systems where a mobility edge exists .",
    "in particular , the immediate proximity of the mobility edge is of special interest .    _ note added . _ after this paper was submitted for publication , a related preprint appeared @xcite . in particular , the authors of that work show that the self - consistent theory does not apply to 1d disordered media , which is consistent with our results because @xmath147 is always small in 1d , provided that the condition @xmath148 assumed in this paper is fulfilled .",
