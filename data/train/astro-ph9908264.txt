    "( 1994 ) and iras point source catalogue ( 1985 ) and for the same band are consistent with a spectral average of the sws data over the spectral response function of iras through the 12 micron band , which yields 281 jy .",
    "some evidence for spectral variability is however provided by a comparison of the iras - lrs spectrum ( volk & cohen 1989 ) and the sws spectrum ( fig.[figlrssws ] ) . while the overall spectral distribution is similar , the line to continuum contrast of the silicate features differ between the datasets .",
    "the continuum level on the iras - lrs spectrum lies markedly below that of the sws level , though it is not clear why this should be bearing in mind the consistency of the iras survey data with the sws photometry and the fact that the haikala et al .",
    "( 1994 ) iras 12@xmath3 m flux density was used to calibrate the lrs spectra , for which there were no obvious technical problems ( priv .",
    "r.waters & lrs database 1987 ) .",
    "probably these differences might also be caused by the extraction of the spectrum from a crowded region , showing a strong gradient in the background ( k.volk , priv .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that the grasdalen et al .",
    "( 1983 ) flux densities in the 2@xmath0-@xmath020@xmath3 m spectral range , measured in the 1970 s , may also support a picture of spectral variability . while most of the data points are consistent with the sws data ,",
    "the values for the pass - bands centred on @xmath31 m and 20@xmath3 m are higher by more than a factor 2 .",
    "one can speculate that the 20@xmath3 m observations may be affected by atmospheric variations ; the discrepancy of the @xmath32 m observation is not really understood .",
    "the previous observations listed in sect.@xmath01 suggest that the star powering iras@xmath017393@xmath13004 is a supergiant of spectral type m. elias et al .",
    "( 1981 ) investigated late - type supergiants in our galaxy and in the magellanic clouds , obtaining @xmath33 and @xmath34 as upper limits .",
    "the extreme case corresponding to these limits is for spectral type m4i ( see e.g. lang 1992 ) , for which we estimate a stellar luminosity of @xmath351.3@xmath36 , using the definition for absolute bolometic luminosity given by lang ( 1974 , eq.(5)-(237 ) ) . combining this luminosity with the observed k band flux density of @xmath37jy ( 2.33mag ) yields an upper limit for the distance @xmath38kpc ( disregarding any extinction by dust ) , placing iras 17393@xmath13004 in front of the nb .",
    "this is also supported by the system velocity of the maser of @xmath39kms@xmath13 ( haikala et al .",
    "1994 ) , which does not coincide with the rotation curve of the nb .",
    "in fact the near - ir colours are consistent with the exciting star being close to the limiting case of an m4i supergiant .",
    "for such a star we estimate , based on the fact that iras@xmath017393@xmath13004 has no optical counterpart on the poss , that the sum of dust extinction in the shell ( expressed in terms of visual extinction ) @xmath40 and in the intervening dust between the sun and the supergiant @xmath41 would be @xmath42mag .",
    "such an extinction would place our nir flux densities in the correct regime of colours given by elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) in table10 for m4i stars .",
    "( 55,61 )      the above considerations have led to a scenario for iras@xmath017393@xmath13004 in which a supergiant of spectral type m4 undergoes a strong mass outflow resulting in a shell of gas and dust surrounding the star for which we estimate a total luminosity close to @xmath43 .",
    "the inner radius of the dust shell r@xmath44 is constrained by the fact that grains are probably needed to form a sufficiently copious amount of molecules to account for the maser source . for",
    "a star with the above luminosity masing must occur within @xmath3510@xmath45 cm for oh masing ( engels et al .",
    "1983 ) and @xmath46 cm for h@xmath4o masing ( elitzur 1992 ) .",
    "the outer bound on the masing region for h@xmath4o is indeed quite close to the sublimation radius for black body grains of @xmath353@xmath010@xmath47 cm for this stellar luminosity and a sublimation temperature of 1230@xmath0k .    to check that the sws spectrum of the dust emission is consistent with this scenario , and to derive parameters for the dust outflow , we have modeled the dust emission using the _ dusty _ code ( ivezi et al .",
    "1997 ; ivezi & elitzur 1997 and 1995 ) .",
    "this solves the spherical radiative transfer problem employing a scaling approach , taking the grains to be distributed from a condensation radius to at least the radius beyond which the grains become too cool to contribute to the sws spectrum . in fact it is also possible to successfully model the dust emission spectrum in terms of a completely optically thin shell with a much larger inner boundary and an outer radius cutoff .",
    "if true this might imply some variability in the recent dust production rate .",
    "however we regard this as inconsistent with the evidence ( from the h@xmath4o maser emission as discussed above ) that grains are being formed at or near the condensation radius . moreover , there is no completely convincing evidence for variability in the warm dust emission ( see sect.2.3 ) .",
    "( 55,62 )    _ dusty",
    "_ s output provides a self - similar set of solutions possessing scaling properties ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) .",
    "this allows a modeling in two steps . in a first step",
    "we adopt @xmath48 ( corresponding to @xmath49mag ) as the optical depth of the dust shell , @xmath50k as the stellar temperature and 1230@xmath0k as the condensation temperature .",
    "subsequently , we fine tune the observed spectrum by varying the temperature of the illuminating black - body source , and the condensation temperature",
    ". variations of @xmath51 in these parameters are clearly noticeable in the shape of the model spectrum .",
    "no attempt is made to model the molecular and atomic absorption / emission line spectrum .",
    "for the density profile we used the analytical approach for a radiatively driven wind , available in _ dusty _ ( see ivezi et al .",
    "the chemical composition of the dust was also varied to find the best fitting model using the six common grain types contained in _ dusty _ and the standard grain size distribution from mathis et al .",
    "the gas to dust ratio is set to 200 by _",
    "the best fit to the isosws spectrum is shown in fig.[figmodel ] .",
    "it was obtained for a temperature of the embedded source of @xmath522980@xmath0k , @xmath5314@xmath0mag , and a dust condensation temperature of 1230k .",
    "the dust composition was set to 60% silicates and 40% graphite grains within the model of draine & lee ( 1984 ) .",
    "the fraction of graphite grains might be quite high for an oxygen - rich star , but such a high fraction is necessary to fit the observed flat slope at longer wavelengths . from discussions with m.elitzur ( priv .",
    "we learned , that some asymmetrical silicate grains show properties very similar to the graphite grains used here , and that this kind of grains are actually found in oxygen - rich stars . in fact such grains will be included in the subsequent version of _",
    "dusty_.    the largest difference between the observed and modeled spectra occurs in the range @xmath54 m .",
    "we attribute this partly to the presence of sio absorption which is not modeled by _",
    "dusty_. in addition this feature may be partly due to the presence of some uncommon silicates in the shell of iras 17393@xmath13004 , in which case the shape of the spectral feature would not be typical .",
    "in addition there could be a combination of emission by the dust shell and absorption by the interstellar dust .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the fact that the ism silicate absorption peaks at a slightly shorter wavelength than the usual 9.7 micron emission peak .",
    "in addition the observed spectrum shows a weak emission feature at about @xmath55 m .",
    "this may either indicate emission from cooler dust in a detached shell , or dust emission features from crystalline mg - rich silicates in the 20@xmath0-@xmath045@xmath3 m range ( e.g. henning 1999 ) .",
    "the other smaller variations between the model fit and the observed spectrum presumably reflect possible variations of the chemical composition and/or grain size .    in a second step",
    "we scale the model by integrating the flux density of the model spectrum @xmath56 to find the bolometric luminosity , which is normalized to @xmath57 , as estimated in sect.3.1 .",
    "this yields a distance of the star of @xmath58kpc if all extinction occurs in the shell , consistent with the crude estimate @xmath59kpc given in sect.3.1 . clearly , some line of sight extinction is to be expected , which would reduce the intrinsic absorption in the shell from the value adopted in the modeling , and reduce the distance to the star . as discussed below ,",
    "this is not a very sensitive parameter , especially in comparison with the condensation temperature parameter . to explore this effect",
    "we also made calculations assuming a line of sight extinction of 5mag .",
    "this would reduce the extinction within the shell to @xmath60mag .",
    "our computations show that this model will lead to a condensation radius which is only @xmath51 smaller and to a mass loss rate which is only @xmath61 lower .",
    "this leads us to consider our results to be upper limits of the actual stellar and associated parameters with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath28 , mainly caused by the calibrational uncertainty of the isosws data .",
    "we return to our original model with all extinction due to dust in the shell surrounding the central star . in this case",
    "the condensation radius scales to @xmath62 cm for the silicate grains , consistent with the maximum radius of @xmath3510@xmath63 cm for the h@xmath4o maser emission ( elitzur 1992 ) .",
    "the derived values for the gas mass loss rate and velocity of the wind are @xmath641.0@xmath65 and @xmath3518.7kms@xmath13 respectively .",
    "the model also yields a mass of @xmath66 for the embedded star .",
    "all these parameters are in remarkably good agreement with the basic observational constraints discussed in sect.3.1 , in particular the identification of the star as a type m4i supergiant .",
    "combining ground- and spaceborne observations we have obtained the spectral energy distribution for the ir / oh star iras@xmath017393@xmath13004 in the wavelength range @xmath67m@xmath68 .",
    "the near - ir spectrum has jhk colours corresponding to an m4 star reddened by dust with @xmath6914@xmath0mag .",
    "the mir spectrum shows prominent silicate peaks at 10.4 and 17.5@xmath3 m as well as an sio absorption around 8@xmath3 m and sio bandheads in the 4.0 - 4.3@xmath19 range .",
    "taken together , the solid - state and molecular features confirm the picture already suggested from the sio , oh and h@xmath4o masing activity that iras 17393@xmath13004 is a luminous oxygen - rich star with a high mass - loss dusty wind . neglecting line of sight extinction , the broad band spectral energy distribution of the dust emission and the extinction in the near - ir can be fitted by a spherically symmetrical outflow of a silicate and graphite grain mixture illuminated by an m4i supergiant situated at a distance of @xmath70 4.73@xmath0kpc with luminosity @xmath71 , dust production rate 5@xmath010@xmath72m@xmath73 and wind velocity @xmath3518.7kms@xmath13 . for a distance of 4.73@xmath0kpc",
    ", the shell s inner boundary diameter corresponds to an angular size of @xmath74 , which will make it accessible in future to quantitative observations with the vla ( maser emission ) and vlti ( mir dust emission ) respectively .",
