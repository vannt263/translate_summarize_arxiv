    "the natural problem of integrating vector fields to obtain appropriate `` flow maps '' on supermanifolds is considered in many articles and monographs ( compare , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) but a `` general answer '' was to our knowledge only given in the work of j. monterde and co - workers ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a supermanifold @xmath0 together with a vector field @xmath1 in @xmath2 , and an initial condition @xmath3 in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an arbitrary supermanifold and @xmath4 denotes the set of morphisms from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the case of classical , ungraded , manifolds leads one to consider the following question : does there exist a `` flow map '' @xmath8 defined on an open sub supermanifold @xmath9 and having values in @xmath7 and an appropriate derivation on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are real numbers , such that the following equations are fulfilled @xmath16 of course , @xmath17 should be a `` flow domain '' , i.e. an open sub supermanifold of @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is contained in the body @xmath20 of @xmath17 and for @xmath21 in @xmath22 , the set @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 is an open interval .",
    "furthermore @xmath25 denotes the natural injection morphism of the closed sub supermanifold @xmath26 of @xmath17 into @xmath17 . of course",
    ", we could concentrate on the case @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but it will be useful for our later arguments to state all results in this ( formally ) more general setting .",
    "+ though for homogeneous vector fields ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) system ( @xmath31 ) does always have a solution , in the general case ( @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) the system is overdetermined .",
    "a simple example of an inhomogeneous vector field such that ( [ eqflowintro ] ) is not solvable is given by @xmath35 on @xmath36 .",
    "the crucial novelty of @xcite is to consider instead of ( [ eqflowintro ] ) the following modified , weakened , problem @xmath37 where @xmath38 is again the natural injection ( and where the above more general derivation @xmath39 could be replaced by @xmath40 since @xmath41 annihilates germs of superfunctions of the type @xmath42 .",
    "+ in @xcite ( making indispensable use of @xcite ) it is shown that in the smooth case ( [ eqflowintro2 ] ) has a unique maximal solution @xmath8 , defined on the flow domain @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the maximal flow domain for the flow of the reduced vector field @xmath45 on @xmath46 with initial condition @xmath47 . since the results of @xcite are obtained by the use of a batchelor model for @xmath7 , i.e. a real vector bundle @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , and a connection on @xmath50 , we follow here another road , closer to the classical , ungraded , case and also applicable in the case of complex supermanifolds and holomorphic vector fields . + our new method of integrating smooth vector fields on a supermanifold in section 2 consists in first locally solving a finite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations , and is here partly inspired by the approach of @xcite , where the case of homogeneous super vector fields on compact supermanifolds is treated .",
    "we then show existence and unicity of solutions of ( [ eqflowintro2 ] ) on smooth supermanifolds and easily deduce the results of @xcite from our lemmata [ theolocal ] and [ theoglob ]",
    ". + a second beautiful result of @xcite ( more precisely , theorem 3.6 of that reference ) concerns the question if the flow @xmath8 solving ( [ eqflowintro2 ] ) fulfills `` flow equations '' , as in the ungraded case . hereby , we mean the existence of a lie supergroup structure on @xmath10 such that @xmath8 is a local action of @xmath10 on @xmath7 ( in case @xmath51 ) .",
    "again , the answer is a little bit unexpected : in general , given @xmath1 and its flow @xmath52 , there is no lie supergroup structure on @xmath10 such that @xmath8 is a local @xmath10-action ( with regard to this structure ) .",
    "the condition for the existence of such a structure on @xmath10 is equivalent to the condition that ( [ eqflowintro2 ] ) holds without the post - composition with @xmath41 , i.e. the overdetermined system ( [ eqflowintro ] ) is solvable .",
    "furthermore , both conditions cited are equivalent to the condition that @xmath53 is a sub lie superalgebra of @xmath2 , the lie superalgebra of all vector fields on @xmath7 .",
    "+ after discussing lie supergroup structures and right invariant vector fields on @xmath10 , as well as local lie group actions in the category of supermanifolds in general , we show in section 3 the equivalence of the above three conditions , already given in @xcite .",
    "we include our proof here notably in order to be able to apply it in the holomorphic case in section 5 ( see below ) by simply indicating how to adapt it to this context .",
    "let us nevertheless observe that our result is slightly more general since we do not need to ask for any normalization of the supercommutators between @xmath54 and @xmath55 resp .",
    "@xmath54 , thus giving the criterion some extra flexibility in applications .",
    "+ in section 4 , we give several examples of vector fields on supermanifolds , homogeneous and inhomogeneous , and explain their integration to flows .",
    "notably , we construct an exponential morphism for an arbitrary finite - dimensional lie supergroup , via a canonically defined vector field and its flow .",
    "we comment here also on the integration of what are usually called ",
    "( infinitesimal ) supersymmetries \" in physics , i.e. , purely odd vector fields having non - vanishing self - commutators . + finally ,",
    "in section 5 we adapt our method to obtain flows of vector fields ( compare section 2 and notably lemma [ theolocal ] ) to the case of holomorphic vector fields on holomorphic supermanifolds .",
    "to avoid monodromy problems one has , of course , to take care of the topology of the flow domains , and maximal flow domains are -as already in the ungraded holomorphic case- no more unique .",
    "otherwise the analogues of all results in section 2 and 3 continue to hold in the holomorphic setting . + throughout the whole article we will work in the ringed space - approach to supermanifolds ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for detailed accounts of this approach ) . given two supermanifolds @xmath0 and @xmath56 ,",
    "a `` morphism '' @xmath57 is thus given by a continuous map @xmath58 between the `` bodies '' of the two supermanifolds and a sheaf homomophism @xmath59 .",
    "the topological space @xmath46 comes canonically with a sheaf @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ideal sheaf generated by the germs of odd superfunctions , such that @xmath62 is a smooth real manifold .",
    "then @xmath47 is a smooth map from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "let us recall that a ( super ) vector field on @xmath0 is , by definition , an element of the lie superalgebra @xmath64 and that @xmath1 always induces a smooth vector field @xmath65 on @xmath62 . for @xmath66 in @xmath46 and @xmath67",
    "one defines @xmath68 , where @xmath55 is the even part of @xmath1 and for @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the value of @xmath71 in the point @xmath66 of @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we give our main result on the integration of general ( i.e. not necessary homogeneous ) vector fields by a new method , avoiding auxiliary choices of batchelor models and connections , as in @xcite .",
    "our more direct approach is inspired , e.g. , by @xcite , where the case of homogeneous vector fields on compact manifolds is treated , and it can be adapted to the holomorphic case ( see section 4 ) . + for the sake of readability we will often use the following shorthand : if @xmath72 is a supermanifold , we write @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , the canonical coordinates of @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with ensueing vector fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "let now @xmath17 be @xmath89 and @xmath90 the canonical coordinates on @xmath10 , then there exists a unique @xmath91 such that @xmath92 moreover , @xmath93 equals the underlying classical flow map @xmath94 of the vector field @xmath65 with initial condition @xmath47 .",
    "* let @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the canonical coordinates on @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . then there exist smooth functions @xmath99 such that @xmath100 where @xmath101 runs over the index set @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
