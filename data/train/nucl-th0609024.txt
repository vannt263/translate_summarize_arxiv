    "<S> many factors that influence the isovector potential directly or indirectly can modify the behavior of the density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> recently the density dependence of the symmetry energy has been extensively explored through the inclusion of the isoscalar - isovector coupling terms in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we will perform the investigation in rmf models considering the isoscalar - isovector coupling terms that soften the symmetry energy at large densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the modification in memos and hyperon - rich matter due to the isoscalar - isovector couplings is usually considered to be small due to the relatively weak meson - hyperon coupling . as pointed out in refs.@xcite that the memos may reach a very high baryon density ( @xmath6 ) like strangelets . in hyperon - rich matter </S>",
    "<S> , the appearance of @xmath0 hyperons occurs at about twice normal density . </S>",
    "<S> since the higher density relates to the larger isoscalar potentials ( or fields ) , the isoscalar - isovector couplings will induce large modifications . in hyperon - rich matter </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on the relation between the @xmath0 fraction and the isoscalar - isovector coupling . </S>",
    "<S> as the determination of properties of neutron stars with hyperonization needs the equation of state of hyperon - rich matter , we may search for the observable consequence relating to the density dependence of the symmetry energy . as examples of memos </S>",

    "<S> the density dependence of the symmetry energy is different between two models because of different @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 for the nl3 and @xmath42 for the s271 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> we take the ratio of the scalar coupling constant to be @xmath56 in nl3 with a potential for the @xmath0 hyperon in @xmath57 matter @xmath58mev . in s271 , </S>",
    "<S> the same potential is taken to obtain the ratio @xmath59 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath54 of @xmath60be is improved from 0.38 mev to 2.2 mev in nl3 , and from 0.2 mev to 3.9 mev in s271 , much close to the extracted value @xmath61 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 is determined by the @xmath57 hyperon potential in @xmath57 matter @xmath63mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath64 tensor coupling is vanishing , and the @xmath65 tensor coupling is small but adjusted to simulate the vanishing spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath0 hyperon observed in @xmath66o .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we perform calculations for various isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath67 s , and the @xmath68 is set as zero . for a given coupling @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> , we follow ref.@xcite to readjust the @xmath69 coupling constant @xmath38 so as to keep an average symmetry energy fixed as 25.7 at @xmath70 @xmath33 . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , it was found in ref.@xcite that the binding energy of @xmath1pb is nearly unchanged for various @xmath67 s . </S>",
    "<S> below , we will see how the total binding energy of multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei is modified by the @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy per baryon for various @xmath71ca+@xmath0 s systems is displayed in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> metastable minima appears with the rise of the @xmath0 hyperon number @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the additional @xmath10 attraction , simulated by the strange mesons , produces much larger binding energy at larger @xmath73 and shifts the minima outwards . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of binding energies of multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei in nl3 and in s271 enlarges explicitly with the rise of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> since both models share the same saturation properties and take the same potential for the @xmath0 hyperon , this enlargement is attributed to the different density dependence of the symmetry energy . with the rise of @xmath72 , the central density of multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei increases . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the central density in @xmath71ca@xmath74 is about 1.43@xmath75 in nl3 which is much larger than 1.06@xmath75 in @xmath71ca . </S>",
    "<S> the more different symmetry energy at the larger density domain , shown in the inset in fig.[fig1 ] , thus accounts for the large difference of the binding energy at larger @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig2 ] shows that the two - neutron separation energy of @xmath76ca+@xmath0 s systems increases from the negative to the positive with the rise of @xmath72 . as the @xmath72 increases , the nucleon potential is enhanced by the attraction between hyperons and nucleons , being able to fill in more neutrons under the continuum . the neutron drip line can thus be largely extended . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the drip line of ca isotope can be extended from the neutron number 50@xcite to 82 as long as about 50 @xmath0 s are filled in . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the separation energy on the isoscalar - isovector coupling @xmath67 reduces approximately with the increase of @xmath72 . in refs.@xcite , a large class of memos </S>",
    "<S> are constructed by adding multi - hyperons in stable nuclei , while here we aim at the extension of the neutron drip line by filling in @xmath0 hyperons in unstable isotopes . as multi-@xmath77 hypernuclei </S>",
    "<S> may exert their roles in extending the neutron drip line and binding baryons more strongly than in normal nuclei , they will potentially influence the astrophysical nucleosynthesis and the abundances of elements . to search for multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei with the @xmath72 up to 50 </S>",
    "<S> is possible but certainly difficult@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we just devote ourselves to investigating the sensitivity of properties of such exotic systems to the density dependence of the symmetry energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the total binding energy to the @xmath67 is different for various @xmath71ca+@xmath0 s systems . for @xmath71ca+@xmath0 s systems that are unstable against the neutron emission at small @xmath72 and unstable against the @xmath0 hyperon emission at very large @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the total binding energies can be modified by as much as tens of mev for various @xmath67 s . for stable @xmath71ca+@xmath0 s systems </S>",
    "<S> whose binding energies are situated on or very close to the minima , shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the modification to the total binding energies by various @xmath67 s is quite small . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the total binding energy for @xmath71ca+50@xmath0 in nl3 is just modified by up to 2mev with various @xmath67 values .    </S>",
    "<S> a data to data correlation of the neutron thicknesses between @xmath1pb and stable multi-@xmath0 nuclei can be established as in refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron thickness of these stable multi-@xmath0 nuclei is very sensitive to the @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the uncertainty of the neutron thickness for @xmath71ca+40@xmath0 and @xmath71ca+50@xmath0 is about 3 times that for @xmath1pb . </S>",
    "<S> the proton density distribution in these exotic system is also sensitive to the @xmath67 and one third of the uncertainty of the neutron thickness comes from the protons . </S>",
    "<S> the large uncertainty of the neutron thickness is attributed to the addition of the @xmath0 hyperons , which will be elucidated below .    </S>",
    "<S> usually , one modifies the isospin dependent potential considering the shift of the isospin and the isovector field directly . here , we modify it by enhancing the isoscalar field ( @xmath25 field ) through filling in @xmath0 s without changing the isospin of the system , which is fulfilled by considering the isoscalar - isovector coupling . in fig.[fig4 ] </S>",
    "<S> , the isovector potentials are displayed for @xmath71ca and @xmath71ca+@xmath78 in nl3 . in s271 </S>",
    "<S> , similar results for these two systems can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the isovector potentials for various @xmath67 s in the exotic isotope are largely shifted by filling in considerable @xmath0 hyperons . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty of the isovector potential against the @xmath67 in @xmath71ca is much larger in the larger radius region , compatible with the understanding that @xmath71ca is totally diffusive and unstable . </S>",
    "<S> compared to results for @xmath71ca , the sensitivity of the isovector potential to the @xmath67 in @xmath71ca+@xmath78 is shifted to the central region , and at the large radius the convergence occurs , which is favored by the extension of the neutron drip line . </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in fig.[fig4 ] for two exotic systems are related to different density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the central density in @xmath71ca+@xmath78 is about one third higher than that in @xmath71ca . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of the symmetry energy for various @xmath67 s enlarges with the rise of the density beyond the normal density or even much lower density@xcite . at the central region in @xmath71ca+@xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> the isovector potential is more sensitive to the @xmath67 than that in @xmath71ca . </S>",
    "<S> the isoscalar potential can also be shifted to a certain degree by the @xmath67 , whereas for the normal nuclei the shift is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the isovector potential to the @xmath67 is responsible for the uncertainty of the neutron thickness .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 hyperon constituent is important in astrophysical bulk matter to explore the effects of the density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the @xmath0 and @xmath79 fractions defined by @xmath80 in fig.[fig5 ] with the s271 based on a self - consistent calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the large sensitivity of the hyperon fractions to the @xmath67 occurs at about @xmath2 where the @xmath0 hyperon starts to appear . since the density as high as @xmath2 is accessible through the heavy ion collisions with the colliding energy about 1gev per nucleon , the detection related to the hyperons , especially the @xmath0 s , in heavy ion collisions is helpful to probe the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the starting density for the @xmath0 appearance is model dependent . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it is about 1.8@xmath81 in nl3 and 2.2@xmath81 in s271 . as shown in the inset in fig.[fig5 ] , a shift of the isovector potential starts to appear with the @xmath0 appearance , and the isovector potential differs more from that without hyperonization with the increase of the density . in multi-@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> nuclei far from the normal drip line , the isovector potential is shifted by filling in @xmath0 s under the fixed isospin , while here the shift comes from the change of the isospin and the isoscalar field together . the convergent extent with respect to the @xmath67 exists for the hyperon fraction in the whole density domain </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that it is favorable to include the isoscalar - isovector coupling terms for the model itself . at very high densities </S>",
    "<S> , the convergence of hyperon fractions occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to the fact that the isospin is largely suppressed with the drop of the neutron fraction at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> the isovector potential is thus small compared to the isoscalar potential , so that the isoscalar potential is little changed through the isoscalar - isovector coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the hyperstars@xcite whose core is solely composed of hypermatter at high densities will be insensitive to the @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> the large reduction of the maximum mass of neutron stars by hyperonization , firstly pointed out by glendenning ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , can be reproduced here . in nl3 , </S>",
    "<S> hyperonization in the core reduces the maximum neutron star mass by about 0.9@xmath5 from about 2.8@xmath5 , and by 0.75@xmath5 from about 2.4@xmath5 in s271 . </S>",
    "<S> compared to models in which hyperons are absent , hyperonization in the neutron star whose mass is near the maximum mass increases the central baryon density by as much as 1@xmath81 in the region @xmath82 km . for a 1.4 solar - mass neutron star , </S>",
    "<S> the role of hyperonization is quite limited because of relative low core densities . using the oppenheimer - volkoff equations for bulk </S>",
    "<S> matter in beta equilibrium , we thus investigate neutron stars with relative large masses : 1.8@xmath5 with the nl3 model and 1.62@xmath5 with the s271 model . in fig.[fig6 ] , the radii of neutron stars with respective masses in two models are displayed as a function of the neutron thickness for @xmath1pb . </S>",
    "<S> the radius r of neutron star without hyperonization increases with the neutron thickness in @xmath1pb for a given parameter set , which is the same as in ref.@xcite . for neutron stars with hyperonization , </S>",
    "<S> the trend is similar , whereas the correlation between the r and the neutron thickness in @xmath1pb almost vanishes in a large region of the neutron thickness in @xmath1pb . </S>",
    "<S> this property is consistent with the convergent extent shown in fig.[fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that for a neutron star with hyperonization the radius r nearly just depends on the on - off switch rather than concrete values of the isoscalar - isovector coupling in a given model . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate measurement of the neutron radius for @xmath1pb at the jefferson laboratory@xcite determines the density dependence of the symmetry energy at low densities , as pointed out in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the radius of the neutron star with hyperonization can discriminate two regions of the @xmath67 s to which the r is either very sensitive or insensitive at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> various information through separate measurements may be combined together to constrain the isoscalar - isovector coupling that modifies the density dependence of the symmetry energy in the whole density region .    in summary , we have studied the roles of the isoscalar @xmath0 hyperons in exploring the density dependence of the symmetry energy in multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei , hyperon - rich matter and neutron stars with rmf models . </S>",
    "<S> relationships between the properties of three types of objects and the neutron thickness in @xmath1pb are established with respect to the isoscalar - isovector coupling that modifies the density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> the exotic isotopes far from the neutron drip line can be stabilized by filling in considerable @xmath0 hyperons , and the neutron drip line is substantially extended outwards . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the binding energy of multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei from different models is attributed to different symmetry energies . </S>",
    "<S> the isovector potential together with the neutron thickness in multi-@xmath0 hypernuclei situated on the new drip line that is far from the normal drip line is very sensitive to the isoscalar - isovector coupling . in beta </S>",
    "<S> equilibrated hyperon - rich matter , we have investigated the sensitivity of the hyperon fractions to the isoscalar - isovector coupling based on the self - consistent calculation for hyperons and nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the large sensitivity of the @xmath0 hyperon fraction to the isoscalar - isovector coupling occurs at about @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of neutron stars are investigated . an on - off effect with respect to the isoscalar - isovector coupling exists for the radius of neutron stars with hyperonization . besides the detection of @xmath0 hyperons in the heavy ion collisions , </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the neutron star radius and neutron thickness in @xmath1pb could help set up the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>"
