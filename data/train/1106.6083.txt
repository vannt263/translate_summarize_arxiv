    "neutron detection systems incorporating a neutron capture agent or neutron capture indicating detector have many applications .",
    "these include thermal neutron detection ( e.g. @xmath6he tubes ) , capture - gated neutron spectrometry  @xcite , and reactor antineutrino detection  @xcite . materials or systems that provide an unambiguous indication of a neutron capture are preferred in all these applications , as this provides a means of rejecting background . in all of the applications listed above , gamma ray rejection is of high importance , while in antineutrino detection rejection of multiple neutrons from a single cosmic ray could also be advantageous .",
    "here we describe an investigation of a detector material that can identify neutron captures and therefore reject a large fraction of these background events .",
    "the material , produced by msi / photogenics , consists of @xmath4  mm shards of an inorganic scintillator distributed in a plastic scintillator matrix , loaded to 1% by weight .",
    "the inorganic scintillator @xmath0li@xmath1gd@xmath2bo@xmath3:ce ( `` lgb '' ) , has a very high neutron capture cross section , high light output , and has an index of refection well matched to that of plastic scintillator  @xcite .",
    "neutron captures on @xmath0li or @xmath7b are relatively easy to identify via pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) techniques , since the resulting heavy ions are fully contained within the crystal shards and the inorganic scintillator has a relatively long ( @xmath8  ns ) decay time , compared to the organic scintillator ( @xmath9  ns ) .",
    "previous studies of this composite material have used higher crystal loadings so as to maximize neutron capture efficiency  @xcite .",
    "these higher loadings led to relatively poor optical properties , and therefore limited the useable volume . here , we consider the effect of more modest loadings , and assess the suitability of the inhomogeneous material for larger detectors like those required for for antineutrino detection and large area fast and thermal neutron detectors .",
    "two detectors were acquired from msi / photogenics for this investigation .",
    "the first was a cylinder of @xmath10  cm diameter and @xmath11  cm length containing crystal shards ranging in linear dimension between @xmath12  mm and @xmath13  mm .",
    "the second was a cylinder of @xmath10  cm diameter and @xmath14  cm length containing crystal shards ranging in linear dimension between @xmath13  mm and @xmath15  mm .",
    "each detector was loaded with @xmath5 by weight of lgb crystal shards . a photograph of the smaller detector is shown in fig .  [ fig : photo ] .",
    "clearly , the optical transmission properties of the base plastic material in the visible light spectrum are affected by the inclusion of the crystal shards and a trapped air bubble is apparent .",
    "@xmath16  cm photomultipler tube ( pmt ) assemblies were coupled to each end of the detector cylinders using optical grease .",

    "[ fig : psd_daq]a .",
    "two copies of each pmt signal are integrated by a caen v792n qdc .",
    "the delay between these two copies is carefully adjusted with respect to the qdc gate so that one copy is fully integrated , while only the tail portion of the second copy is . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd_daq]b this approach yields a different value for the ratio of integrated amplitudes for events with different decay constants .",
    "the full charge integral can be used for an event energy determination .",
    "this method is equivalent to implementing two different qdc gates during the charge integration of each pmt pulse .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes thus determined ( `` tail / full '' ) depends upon the decay time constant of the pmt pulse . for events occurring within the fast decaying plastic scintillator",
    "this ratio will be small , whereas for events occurring within the slow decaying lgb crystals it will be large .",
    "a relationship between recorded qdc charge and electron - equivalent energy deposition in the plastic scintillator component of the two detectors was established using the @xmath17  kev and @xmath18  kev gamma rays emitted by a @xmath19na source . a `` fan '' collimator of lead bricks separated by a @xmath20  cm gap was used to preferentially illuminate the center portion of each detector .",
    "the `` full '' response was recorded and is plotted for each pmt and detector in fig .",

    ", width=288 ]    using the reasonable approximation of exponential attenuation of light as it propagates through the detectors , we can combine the recorded signals of the `` left '' and `` right '' pmts ( @xmath23and @xmath24 ) to correct for interaction position dependencies in the analysis that follows . assuming an effective attenuation length ( @xmath25 ) , that incorporates the effect of the both non - perfect reflection at the detector boundaries and optical absorption within the detector , we can write the event energy ( @xmath26 ) as :    @xmath27    that this is a reasonable approach here can be seen in fig .",

    "na source placed at various positions relative to the center of the ( a ) @xmath11  cm and ( b ) @xmath14  cm detectors .",
    "the good agreement between these spectra indicates that position dependencies are largely accounted for by the appropriate combination of the two pmt amplitudes.,width=288 ]",

    "if it were economically feasible to produce gadolinium depleted in @xmath31gd and @xmath32gd , very attractive capture efficiencies could be achieved .",
    "in particular , use of @xmath33gd and @xmath34b would be ideal , providing high efficiency for the easily identified @xmath0li capture .",
    "the composite lgb / plastic scintillator material has many attractive features for antineutrino detection .",
    "the very good psd separation of @xmath0li neutron captures would provide a powerful means to reject random @xmath29  ray coincidences .",

    "plastic could have practical advantages over the more typically used liquid scintillator .",
    "however , this material , as currently realized , also has significant drawbacks .",
    "the optical properties do not support detector elements of the desired length .",
    "also , despite its very high neutron capture cross section , the incorporation of gadolinium in the inorganic crystal results in a reduced identifiable neutron capture efficiency . further work to improve the manufacturing process that incorporates the crystals shards in the plastic would be beneficial .",
    "other avenues for future investigation include studying the effect of crystal shard size upon neutron capture efficiency and attempting to identify other suitable inorganic crystals that contain only @xmath0li as a neutron capture agent .",
    "finally , we note that this material would be ideal for use in a segmented capture - gated neutron spectrometer : appropriate segmentation would allow for enhanced event - by - event resolution  @xcite , while the unambiguous neutron capture indication would provide strong background rejection .",
