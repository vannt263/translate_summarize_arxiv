    "almost all the analysis of the decaying light - curves of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows is done within the framework of external shocks driven into the circumburst medium by ultrarelativistic ejecta ( mszros & rees 1997 ) whose kinetic energy is the same in all directions .",
    "a non - isotropic distribution of the energy per solid angle within the outflow is a natural extension of the afterglow model .",
    "fireballs whose kinetic energy and initial lorentz factor fall - off with angle are power - laws have been considered for the first time by mszros , rees & wijers ( 1998 ) , who studied the effect of such distributions on the afterglow light - curve decay .",
    "the faster dimming of the afterglow emission that a structured outflow can produce has been used by dai & gou ( 2001 ) to explain the steep fall - off of the optical light - curve of the afterglow 991208 .",
    "postnov , prokhorov and lipunov ( 2001 ) have suggested that grb outflows may have a universal angular structure , the observed distribution of isotropic @xmath2-ray outputs ( which has a width of 3 dex ) being due to the observer location .",
    "rossi , lazzati & rees ( 2002 ) and zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) have proposed that the light - curve breaks seen in several grb afterglows and the narrow distributions of the grb energy release ( frail 2001 ) and jet kinetic energy ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) may be due to the angular structure of fireballs .    in this work , we present an analytical treatment of the afterglow light - curves from structured fireballs (  [ analytical ] ) , focusing on axially symmetric fireballs endowed with a power - law distribution of the energy (  [ plaw ] ) . in ",
    "[ criteria ] we give criteria which can be used to assess from the afterglow properties when structure and collimation of grb outflows is required by observations , and apply these criteria to the afterglows whose optical light - curves exhibited a break .",
    "section  [ models ] presents the numerical modeling of two grb afterglows , 990510 and 000301c , in the framework of structured jets , leading to a few important conclusions about the role of structure in these two cases .",
    "in this section we calculate the evolution of the afterglow light - curve index @xmath3 , defined as the logarithmic derivative with respect to the observer time @xmath4 of the received flux @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for a fireball endowed with structure .",
    "our aim is to obtain the dependence of of @xmath3 and its asymptotic values at early and late times on the fireball s angular structure , the sharpness of the afterglow light - curve break that the structure can produce .",
    "the calculation of the afterglow light - curve requires the following ingredients : dynamics of the fireball , spectrum of its emission , and integration over the equal photon - arrival - time surface . for analytical calculations",
    ", we shall ignore the tangential motions and mixing in the fireball and consider a simplified scenario where a fluid patch travels as if it were part of a uniform fireball .    for simplicity ,",
    "in our analytical calculations of the light - curve index we consider only adiabatic grb remnants , a case encountered when electrons acquire a negligible fraction of the post - shock energy or if they cool on a timescale longer than the dynamical time .",
    "radiative losses could be important during the early afterglow , in which case the results presented in this section should be re - derived taking into account their effect on the evolution of the fireball lorentz factor @xmath2 [ ( [ gm ] ) ] .",
    "this effect is included in the numerical calculations presented in  [ 0510 ] and  [ 0301 ] .    for an adiabatic fireball ,",
    "energy conservation gives that the lorentz factor of a fluid patch moving in the direction ( @xmath7 ) ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the polar and azimuthal angles in a spherical polar coordinate system aligned to the direction toward the observer ) decreases with its radial location @xmath10 according to : @xmath11^{1/2}\\ , r^{-(3-s)/2 } \\ ; , \\label{gm}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a constant , independent of direction , @xmath13 is the kinetic energy per solid angle of the ejecta moving in the ( @xmath7 ) direction , and @xmath14 describes the type of external medium : @xmath15 , @xmath16 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath17 for a wind ejected at constant speed and mass - loss rate .",
    "equation ( [ gm ] ) holds for @xmath10 larger than the radius at which the fireball deceleration sets in and until the fireball becomes semi - relativistic .",
    "hereafter we will focus on this case , as it applies to observer times of at least 10 days , when the afterglow light - curve breaks are seen .",
    "the photons emitted by a patch ( @xmath18 ) arrive at observer at a time @xmath4 given by integrating @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity of the patch , and the speed of light is unity . in the limit of relativistic motion ( @xmath21 )",
    "most radiation received by observer comes from the shocked medium moving at small angles ( @xmath22 ) relative to the line of sight . with these two assumptions , equation ( [ tobs ] )",
    "leads to the following equation for the radius @xmath10 of the patch moving in direction ( @xmath23 ) as a function of observer time @xmath24    the peak synchrotron flux @xmath25 received from a @xmath26 patch is proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the doppler boost factor , @xmath29 is the comoving frame peak intensity at frequency @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the area of the patch .",
    "the @xmath29 is proportional to the product @xmath32 of the surface density of energized electrons and the magnetic field within the shocked external medium .",

    "the time dependence of the flux given in equation ( [ fnu1 ] ) is due to the variation of @xmath2 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 with the location @xmath10 of the patch , which is related to the observer time through equation ( [ time ] ) . by substituting @xmath40 and @xmath41 in equation ( [ fnu1 ] ) ,",
    "the flux becomes @xmath42    the spectral factor @xmath43 is determined by the distribution of the radiating electrons .",
    "this distribution is shaped by the continuous injection in the downstream region of shock - accelerated electrons with a power - law distribution in energy , @xmath44 , above a minimum electron energy @xmath45 , and by radiative cooling .",
    "the resulting electron distribution exhibits a cooling break at an energy @xmath46 for which the cooling timescale ( @xmath47 ) equals the age of the fireball ( @xmath48 ) , therefore @xmath49 . above @xmath46",

    ". the fireball deceleration being slower for a wind - like medium , it takes a longer time for the core edge to become fully visible , thus the transition between the asymptotic light - curve indices is smoother .",
    "figure 1 also shows the light - curve steepening for a fireball with @xmath147 , corresponding to a uniform , collimated outflow with a sharp edge , undergoing lateral spreading . due to the widening of the jet aperture ,",
    "@xmath148 is not constant , but increases slowly in time .",

    "therefore the `` jet - break '' transition is significantly slower and smoother if the surrounding medium is the wind that a massive grb progenitor expelled before the burst ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .      for observers located outside the uniform fireball core",
    ", the pre - break light - curve fall - off is mitigated as the more energetic ejecta located closer to the fireball axis become visible , therefore the early time light - curve index @xmath154 decreases in time ( see also the light - curves presented by granot & kumar 2003 and wei & jin 2003 ) .",

    "observer line ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) .",
    "well after @xmath156 , when the beaming factor @xmath157 is almost the same across the fireball core , the light - curve index for an off - core observer should reach that given in equations ( [ a20])([a2 ] ) for an on - axis observer .",
    "thus , the flattening of the light - curve fall - off at @xmath158 yields larger light - curve breaks @xmath159 than for an on - axis observer .",
    "this is the most important feature arising from the structure of the outflow .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of @xmath138 obtained from equation ( [ fnu2 ] ) for an off - core observer located at @xmath160 .",
    "as can be noticed , a stronger fall - off of the ejecta energy away from the fireball axis ( a larger parameter @xmath132 ) , leads to a more prominent flattening of the afterglow light - curve at @xmath161 , where @xmath162 for @xmath16 and @xmath163 for @xmath17 .",
    "also as expected , at @xmath164 the index @xmath138 asymptotically reaches the values for an on - axis observer . note that , for the same parameter @xmath132 , the light - curve break @xmath159 across @xmath156 is larger for a homogeneous medium , and that the transition between the lowest value of @xmath138 and the @xmath113 at late time takes about a decade in time for a homogeneous medium and about two decades for a wind - like medium .",
    "the slow transition in the latter case ( see also dai & gou 2001 and granot & kumar 2003 ) suggests that , for a wind - like stratified medium , light - curve breaks arising from the structure of the outflow may be too shallow compared the light - curve steepenings observed in some afterglows , which last less than a decade in time .    the minimal value @xmath165 reached by the light - curve index before the break depends not only on the structural parameter @xmath132 , as shown in figure 2 , but also on the location of the observer , through the ratio @xmath166 , and on the slope @xmath84 of the electron distribution . as illustrated in figure 3",
    ", the observer location has a much stronger effect on the sharpness of the light - curve break produced by the fireball structure if the external medium is homogeneous . in this case , for observer directions further away from the fireball axis , @xmath165 decreases and the transition between @xmath165 and the @xmath113 at late times lasts shorter ( relative to the break - time @xmath156 ) , the light - curve break becoming sharper . consequently , for a homogeneous medium , higher observer offsets will accommodate easier some of the observed sharp breaks . however , given the expected correlation between the grb peak flux and the energy of ejecta moving toward the observer , large observer offsets render the burst less likely to be detected .",
    "furthermore , for homogeneous media , as shown in figure 3 , large offsets also yield pre - break light - curve indices that are too small compared to those observed .",
    "taking @xmath167 as a more likely case , so that the resulting grb is sufficiently bright and the afterglow break sufficiently sharp , we show in figure 4 the dependence of the pre - break minimum light - curve index @xmath165 on the structural parameter @xmath132 and on the electron index @xmath84 . because most of the effect of the latter is through the @xmath168 factor in equation ( [ a1 ] )",
    ", the @xmath169 has been offset by its value @xmath170 for a uniform fireball , to illustrate the less trivial effect of @xmath84 on @xmath165 .",
    "the minimum light - curve index @xmath165 shown in figure 2 should be close to the pre - break index usually inferred by fitting the afterglow light - curve with a smoothed broken power - law ( beuermann 1999 ) , while the post - break index inferred from observations is either the @xmath113 given in equations ( [ a20])([a2 ] ) for a structured fireball , or the electron index @xmath84 for a jet ( uniform or with structure ) whose edge is visible .",
    "furthermore , one can determine from multiband optical observations the afterglow intrinsic spectral slope @xmath171 , defined as @xmath172 , which depends only on the electron index @xmath84 : @xmath173 if there is a significant dust reddening in the host galaxy , @xmath171 can be determined with the aid of the @xmath174-ray spectral slope , if available , or of fits to the optical spectrum , if it is sufficiently curved to constrain the host extinction for an assumed dust - reddening law ( jensen 2001 , fynbo 2001 ) .",
    "thus , observations provide three characteristics of the afterglow emission : pre- and post- break light - curve indices @xmath165 and @xmath113 , and spectral slope @xmath171 , which constrain three major fireball parameters : the structural index @xmath132 , the observer location @xmath166 , and the electron index @xmath84 .",
    "an analytical determination of @xmath132 from the measured asymptotic light - curve indices is hampered by the complicated dependence of the pre - break index @xmath165 on @xmath132 and observer location ( figures 2 and 3 ) and by that the post - break index @xmath113 could be affected by the lateral spreading of the outflow . the observer location @xmath175 considered in figures 2 and 4 can be taken as representative , but , for a more secure approach to determining the fireball structure , one should fit the observed break with a numerically calculated afterglow light - curve , allowing for a free observer location . before proceeding on this path",
    ", we discuss below how the observed asymptotic light - curve indices @xmath154 and @xmath113 and the spectral slope @xmath171 can be used to assess if a structured fireball is required by the observations and if the lateral spreading of the outflow is significant .",
    "we make here the _ assumption _ that the asymptotic pre- and post - break light - curve indices are determined only by the fireball / jet angular structure , radial distribution of the external medium density , and slope of the shock - accelerated electron distribution . in principle",
    "there could be other factors that determine these indices , such as : a refreshed shock produced by slower ejecta catching - up with the grb remnant ( panaitescu , mszros & rees 1998 ) , which may mitigate the afterglow dimming rate if sufficient energy is injected , or a dependence on the ejecta lorentz factor of the electron distribution index or fractional energy acquired by electrons or magnetic field .    from equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) it follows that , for a uniform outflow , the pre - break light - curve index is @xmath176",

    "a more conclusive test should investigate if the light - curve steepening produced by a structured fireball is as sharp as observed , and if the fireball emission at different wavelengths is consistent with the observations . for uniform outflows , the latter",
    "is usually done using a snapshot broadband afterglow spectrum , but , for structured outflows , one has to take in account that , at the same observer time , the ejecta moving at different angles have different lorentz factors , thus their synchrotron emissions have with different characteristic frequencies .    to perform such a test , the data should be fit numerically , followed by a comparison of the best fit @xmath196 obtained for the various model features that are investigated .",
    "the model used hereafter takes into account the spread in the photon arrival time and doppler boost due to the curvature of the jet surface , radiative losses , the effect of inverse compton scatterings on the cooling frequency , and the self - absorption and interstellar scintillation at radio frequencies .",

    "therefore , the assumption of jet uniformity at any time is equivalent to that @xmath205 is a @xmath88-independent quantity .",
    "then , from equation ( [ theta ] ) , it follows that the spreading of any infinitesimal ring is assumed to be governed by @xmath206    the collimation of ejecta affects the afterglow emission in three ways .",
    "first , the size of the visible part of the jet ( @xmath207 ) stops increasing when @xmath208 , when the edge is seen , yielding a light - curve steepening ( panaitescu , mszros & rees 1998 ) .",
    "second , the sideways expansion of the jet increases its sweeping area , which alters the jet dynamics ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "third , the lateral spreading decreases the surface density of the swept - up medium , moving a fraction of the radiating electrons outside the visible region when the jet edge is not yet seen .",
    "the last two effects are important when @xmath209 ( @xmath210 being the initial jet opening ) , which , with the aid of equations ( [ gm ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) , can be shown to occur slightly _ after _ the radius where the jet edge becomes visible if the external medium is homogeneous , and slightly _ before _ if the medium is wind - like .",
    "the jet lateral spreading contributes to the light - curve steepening caused by seeing the jet edge , but also delays the completion of the steepening . because of the slower deceleration caused by a wind - like medium , this completion lasts longer for @xmath17 than for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the light - curve breaks for spreading jets should be smoother than for structured fireballs , the effect being stronger for a wind - like medium than for a homogeneous one ( figures 1 and 2 ) .    for a structured fireball",
    ", we divide its surface in @xmath211 rings and calculate the ring location ( @xmath212 ) and width ( @xmath213 ) using equation ( [ deltheta ] ) , with the local sound speed @xmath214 obtained from the shock jump conditions and dynamics ( @xmath215 ) of the ring , and with @xmath216 . for each step",
    "@xmath217 , the deceleration of the ring is calculated as if it were part of a uniform fireball of kinetic energy per solid angle @xmath218 , which is adjusted at each step to account for the ring spreading @xmath219 and radiative losses .",
    "therefore , we ignore any fluid mixing expected to arise from the tangential flow , a factor which granot & kumar ( 2003 ) have found to have a weak effect on the afterglow emission . equation ( [ deltheta ] ) provides a simple one - to - one mapping of the jet structure at radius @xmath10 into that at @xmath220 , and maintains computationally inexpensive the numerical algorithm for the dynamics .",
    "the uniform jet model has six free parameters : the initial energy density per solid angle within the ejecta @xmath221 , the jet initial half - opening @xmath210 , the external particle density @xmath222 ( or the parameter @xmath223 introduced by chevalier & li 1999 for an @xmath0 wind profile ) , the exponent @xmath84 of the electron distribution , and the fractional energies in electrons and magnetic field in the post - shock gas . for observers located within the initial jet opening ( which is a condition for seeing a grb ) ,",
    "this location is irrelevant ( granot 2002 ) .",
    "the structured jet model with a power - law distribution of the energy per solid angle has three additional parameters : the core size @xmath85 , the power - law exponent @xmath132 , and the observer location @xmath90 .",
    "we apply the structured jet model to the two afterglows with the largest observed steepening @xmath159 : 990510 and 000301c . for 990510",
    ", a jet undergoing lateral spreading at the time of observations is required for either type of external medium .",
    "the purpose of modeling this afterglow is twofold : for @xmath16 we will determine how much structure is allowed by the pre - break light - curve index , for @xmath17 we will assess if a structured outflow improves significantly the best fit by sharpening the light - curve steepening .",
    "the latter is also the purpose of modeling the afterglow 000301c with a structured jet , as its sharp light - curve break can not reproduced with a uniform jet and standard electron distribution even if the external medium is homogeneous .",
    "the optical emission of the 990510 afterglow exhibited a break from an index @xmath224 to @xmath225 ( harrison 1999 ) at @xmath226 days ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the optical and @xmath174-ray slopes , @xmath227 ( stanek 1999 ) and @xmath228 ( kuulkers 2000 ) , indicate that @xmath229 .    in the framework of uniform jets ,",
    "we have previously found ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) that the optical light - curve steepening can be well accommodated ( @xmath230 for 69 degrees of freedom ) with a jet of initial kinetic energy @xmath231 ergs , initial opening @xmath232 , interacting with a homogeneous medium of density @xmath233 .",
    "we have also found that a wind - like medium can not reproduce the steepness of the optical light - curve break , yielding an unacceptable best fit ( @xmath234 for 69 df ) .",
    "for a _ homogeneous _ external medium , equation ( [ ab1 ] ) shows that @xmath235 for a uniform outflow , which is consistent with the observed index , thus a large structural parameter @xmath132 is disfavored , otherwise the early decay would be too shallow .",
    "further , equation ( [ ab2 ] ) shows that , for a fireball , the post - break index @xmath113 can not exceed @xmath236 , which is too small compared to that observed , thus a spreading jet is required . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ alfamax ] ) leads to a post - break index @xmath237 , which is consistent with the measured index .",
    "the above conclusion that the pre - break light - curve index of the afterglow of grb 990510 does not allow much structure in a spreading jet is illustrated in figure 5 , showing the @xmath196 of the fits obtained for several combinations of the structural parameter @xmath132 and jet core size - to - opening ratio @xmath238 , and for two particular observer locations : the jet axis and the jet edge . by decreasing the @xmath238 ratio or increasing @xmath132 ,",
    "a stronger jet structure is enforced .",
    "as can be noticed , only jets with @xmath239 for @xmath240 and @xmath241 for @xmath242 provide acceptable fits ( defined by a probability larger than 10% ) , while fits as good as that provided by a uniform jet ( @xmath230 ) require that @xmath243 if @xmath240 and @xmath244 if @xmath245 .",
    "thus , for @xmath16 , the afterglow of grb 990510 is best explained by a structured jet with a variation of the energy per solid angle less than a factor @xmath246 across the jet surface .",
    "the radio , optical and @xmath174-ray light - curves for the best fit obtained with a structured jet are shown in the left panel of figure 6 .",
    "we note that its parameters are similar to those for a uniform jet",
    ".    for a _ wind - like _ external medium , equation ( [ ab1 ] ) gives @xmath247 for a uniform outflow , thus structure is required in this case to explain the slower decay observed at early time .",
    "equation ( [ ab2 ] ) shows that a structured fireball yields @xmath248 , slightly smaller than the observed index , suggesting that collimation may also be required to accommodate the post - break decay of the this afterglow .",
    "the right panel of figure 6 shows the best fit obtained with a structured jet interacting with a wind medium .",
    "the jet structure improves the fit by @xmath249 relative to the best fit obtained with a uniform jet , which is statistically significant .",
    "however , the optical light - curves steepen too slowly , overestimating the afterglow flux before and after the break and yielding @xmath250 for 66 df .",
    "we conclude that a wind - like medium is not compatible with the observations of the 990510 afterglow even if the jet is endowed with structure .",
    "the @xmath1-band light - curve index of the 000301c afterglow increased from @xmath251 to @xmath252 ( bhargavi & cowsik 2000 ) , a sharp break occurring at @xmath253 days ( figure 7 ) .",
    "jensen ( 2001 ) found that , at @xmath254 days , the optical spectral slope is @xmath255 after correcting for the host reddening , determined from the curvature of the spectrum and assuming an smc reddening law .",
    "@xmath174-ray observations were not made , thus the location of the cooling frequency is not constrained . if @xmath193 then the pre - break light - curve index ( ) @xmath256 for a uniform outflow would be too small compared with that observed .",
    "therefore @xmath190 seems more likely for the 000301c afterglow .    given that structured jets interacting with a wind - like medium produce light - curves that are too smooth , we focus here only on a homogeneous circumburst medium . for @xmath190 and a uniform fireball , equation ( [ ab1 ] ) yields @xmath257 , which is slightly larger than observed ,",
    "thus a structured outflow is only marginally required , while equation ( [ ab2 ] ) leads to @xmath258 , which is well below the observed value , thus a jet is required .",
    "then , according to equation ( [ alfamax ] ) , @xmath259 , which is marginally compatible with the index measured by bhargavi & cowsik ( 2000 ) .",
    "other post - break asymptotic indices reported in the literature are larger ( albeit more uncertain ) , which suggests that a jet model may have difficulties in explaining the steep post - break fall - off of the @xmath1-band light - curve of 000301c .    in the framework of uniform jets ,",
    "we have found ( panaitescu 2001 ) that this indeed the case : the best fit obtained for @xmath16 has @xmath260 for 98 df and @xmath261 ergs , @xmath232 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , failing to produce the observed steepening @xmath264 when the jet edge becomes visible . for this reason",
    ", we have investigated a jet model where the distribution of shock - accelerated electrons has a break , so that a sharp light - curve fall - off is seen after the passage through the optical of the synchrotron characteristic frequency corresponding to this break .",
    "further indication that the distribution of injected electrons is not a pure power - law is provided by the discrepancy between the post - break light - curve indices at radio ( @xmath265 ) and optical frequencies , and also by the @xmath266 color change between 2 and 5 days after the burst ( rhoads & fruchter 2001 ) , which implies a softening of the optical spectral slope @xmath267 that is too fast to be attributed to the passage of the cooling break . the best fit obtained with",
    "the broken power - law injected electron distribution has @xmath268 for 96 df , being marginally acceptable .",
    "figure 7 assesses the ability of a structured jet to accommodate the sharp break of the 000301c afterglow without recourse to a non - standard injected electron distribution .",
    "the new best fit has @xmath269 for 95 df , which is a substantial improvement in comparison with the uniform jet model and a pure power - law electron distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the best fit obtained with a structured jet is not acceptable and , clearly , poorer than the uniform jet model with a broken power - law injected electron distribution .",
    "it does not reproduced well the steep post - break decay of the @xmath1-band light - curve and underestimates the 250 ghz emission .",
    "we note that , for the best fit shown in figure 7 , the cooling frequency falls within the optical domain at a few days , a feature which is required to explain the observed curvature of the optical spectrum ( jensen 2001 ) .",
    "in the standard picture of uniform jets , the measured pre- and post - break light - curve indices and the spectral slope offer an overconstrained problem , as , for a given type of external medium , all these quantities depend only on the exponent of the power - law distribution of shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the angular structure of grb jets and the observer location relative to the axis of the structured jet affects the pre - break index and , possibly , the post - break index also ( [[a2 ] ] , figures 24 ) . for most well - observed afterglows ,",
    "a uniform jet interacting with a homogeneous external medium provides good fits ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , indicating that the freedom allowed by the outflow structure is usually not required by current afterglow observations .",
    "nevertheless , a simple analysis (  [ criteria ] ) of the light - curve indices and spectral slopes , shows that structured outflows are required if the circumburst medium has a wind - like profile ( @xmath17 ) , as , for such media , the resulting steep pre - break light - curve decay must be mitigated by the outflow angular structure .    due to the slower deceleration of jets by wind - like media and the stronger sideways expansion",
    "when the jet edge becomes visible , the light - curve breaks for @xmath17 and uniform jets are too smooth compared with the observations ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "it is then worth investigating if an angular structure in the outflow , yielding a shallower pre - break light - curve decay , sharpens sufficiently the light - curve steepening to make it consistent with the observations .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and the right panel of figure 6 show that the steepening of light - curves from structured fireballs / jets interacting with wind - like media lasts more than a decade in time , suggesting that such media are not able to accommodate all the observed afterglow breaks .    using numerical calculations of the dynamics and synchrotron emission of structured jets ,",
    "we find (  [ 0510 ] ) that little angular structure is allowed for the afterglow 990510 if the external medium is homogeneous .",
    "although acceptable fits to the emission of this afterglow can be obtained even for a tenfold variation of the kinetic energy per solid angle from its axis to edge , fits of quality comparable to that obtained with a uniform jet require an energy variation across the jet surface of less than a factor @xmath246 .",
    "allowing for structure in the jet improves significantly the best fit to 990510 obtained with a wind - like medium , nevertheless the best fit is not acceptable .",
    "the ability of structured jets to yield larger light - curve breaks was also tested against the strong steepening observed for the afterglow 000301c (  [ 0301 ] ) .",
    "we find that the addition of structure greatly improves the fit obtained with a pure power - law electron distribution ; however it does not fare as well as a jet model with a non - standard , broken power - law electron distribution .",
    "nevertheless , angular structure in a wide jet may be a viable explanation for the shallower light - curve breaks ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) seen in other grb afterglows .",
    "in fact , as discussed in  [ criteria ] , a structured fireball is required by some afterglows if the external medium is wind - like . evidently , the best cases for a structured outflow will be those where the light - curve indices and spectral slopes are not consistent with each other within the framework of uniform fireballs . in such cases , equations",
    "( [ ab1])([alfamax ] ) and the criteria derived in  [ criteria ] offer a simple way to assess the importance of structure and collimation in the outflow .",
    "furthermore , equations ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a20])([a2 ] ) , and the results shown in figure 5 can be used to constrain the angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy .",
