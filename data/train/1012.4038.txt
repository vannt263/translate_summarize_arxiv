    "[ fig : qcd ]    on the basis of thermodinamical considerations and of qcd calculations , strongly interacting matter is expected to exist in different states .",
    "its behaviour , as a function of the baryonic chemical potential @xmath1 ( a measure of the baryonic density ) and of the temperature @xmath2 , is displayed in the phase diagram reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd ] ( left ) . at low temperatures and for @xmath3",
    ", we have ordinary matter .",
    "when the energy density @xmath4 of the system is increased , by ` compression ' ( towards the right ) or by ` heating ' ( upward ) , a phase transition predicted : the density of partons ( quarks and gluons ) becomes so high that the confinement of coloured quarks in colourless hadrons vanishes and a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the phase diagram can be explored within the framework of lattice qcd  @xcite , although calculations are limited to cases of null or small @xmath1 .",
    "the phase transition is identified by a large increase of the energy density @xmath5 when the temperature @xmath2 reaches the critical value @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "considering that the energy density of an equilibrated ideal gas of particles with @xmath7 degrees of freedom is @xmath8 , the dramatic increase of @xmath9 at @xmath10 can be interpreted as due to the change of @xmath7 from 3 in the pion gas phase to 37 ( with 2 quark flavours ) in the deconfined phase , where the additional colour and quark flavour degrees of freedom are available . in a qgp with 2 quark",
    "flavours the degrees of freedom are @xmath11 .",
    "the factor 7/8 accounts for the difference between bose - einstein ( gluons ) and fermi - dirac ( quarks ) statistics . ] .",
    "the energy density for a qgp at @xmath10 is @xmath12 .    in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "both temperature and density increase , possibly bringing the system to the phase transition . in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd ] ( left ) the paths estimated for the fixed - target ( sis @xmath13 , ags @xmath14 , sps @xmath15 ) and collider ( rhic @xmath16 , lhc @xmath17@xmath18 ) experiments are shown .",
    "the evolution of a high - energy nucleus ",
    "nucleus collision is usually pictured in the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd ] ( right ) . after a rather short equilibration time @xmath19@xmath20 , the presence of a thermalized medium is assumed , and for sufficiently - high energy densities , this medium would be in the quark - gluon plasma phase .",
    "afterwards , as the expansion reduces the energy density , the system goes through a hadron gas phase and finally reaches the freeze - out , when the final state hadrons do not interact with each other anymore .",
    "the desire to test this fascinating phase structure of strongly - interacting matter led , in the 1990s , to the fixed - target experiments at the ags in brookhaven ( au  au @xmath14 ) and at the cern - sps ( pb  pb @xmath15 ) .",
    "the energy density reached in central pb ",
    "pb collisions at the sps was estimated ( from the measured transverse energy of the produced particles  @xcite ) to be @xmath21 , i.e. above the critical value @xmath22 .",
    "the two clearest indications for the production of a deconfined medium in  collisions at the sps are :    the enhancement of the production of strange and multi - strange baryons ( hyperons ) with respect to the rates extrapolated from pp data ( predicted by j.  rafelski and b.  mller in 1982  @xcite ) ;    the suppression of the production of the j@xmath23 meson ( the lowest @xmath24 bound state ) , always with respect to the rates extrapolated from pp ( predicted by t.  matsui and h.  satz in 1986  @xcite ) .        in the qgp ,",
    "the chiral symmetry restoration decreases the threshold for the production of a @xmath25 pair from twice the constituent mass of the s quark , @xmath26 , to twice the _ bare _ mass of the s quark , @xmath27 , which is less than half of the energy required to produce strange particles in hadronic interactions . in the qgp ,",
    "multi - strange baryons can be produced by statistical combination of strange ( and non - strange ) quarks , while in an hadronic gas they have to be produced through a chain of interactions that increase the strangeness content in steps of one unit .",
    "for this reason an hyperon enhancement growing with the strangeness content was indicated as a signal for qgp formation .",
    "this effect was , indeed , observed by the wa97/na57 experiment  @xcite : in fig .",
    "[ fig : strangeness ] one can see that the production of strange and multi - strange baryons increases by 10 times and more ( up to 20 times for the @xmath28 ) in central  collisions in comparison to , where the qgp is not expected .",
    "as predicted , the enhancement @xmath29 is increasing with the strangeness content : @xmath30 .",
    "the other historic predicted signal of deconfinement was observed , by the na50 and na60 experiments ( in pb  pb and in  in collisions , respectively ) : the suppression of the j@xmath23 particle yield , with respect to the reference drell - yan process  @xcite .",
    "the suppression is interpreted as due to the fact that , in the high colour - charge density environment of a qgp , the strong interaction between the two quarks of the @xmath24 pair is screened and the formation of their bound state is consequently prevented .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven began operation during summer 2000 . with a factor 10 increase in the centre - of - mass energy with respect to the sps ,",
    "@xmath31 up to @xmath32 , the produced collisions are expected to be well above the phase transition threshold . moreover , in this energy regime , the so - called ` hard processes ' production of energetic partons ( @xmath33-@xmath34 ) out of the inelastic scattering of two partons from the colliding nuclei have a significantly large cross section and they become experimentally accessible .    in this scenario ,",
    "beyond the ` traditional ' observables we have already introduced , the interesting phenomenon of in - medium parton energy loss  @xcite , predicted for the first time by j.d .",
    "bjorken in 1982  @xcite , can be addressed .",

    "au , compared to d  au and pp collisions at @xmath16  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    hard partons are produced at the early stage of the collision and they propagate through the medium formed in the collision . during this propagation they undergo interactions ( both inelastic and elastic ) with the gluons present in the medium and they lose energy .",
    "such energy loss is not peculiar of a deconfined medium , but , quantitatively , it is strongly dependent on the nature and on the properties of the medium , being predicted to be much larger in the case of deconfinement .    the measurement of high-@xmath35 ( projection of the momentum on the plane transverse to the beam line ) particle production has been addressed at rhic mainly by the phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite experiments , but has been observed also by the two smaller experiments brahms  @xcite and phobos  @xcite .",
    "the results are striking .",
    "figure  [ fig : raa ] reports the yield of neutral and charged hadrons measured by phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite in central au  au collisions at @xmath16 , divided by the yield in pp collisions at the same energy and by the estimated number of binary nucleon ",
    "nucleon collisions .",
    "this ratio , @xmath36 , should be one at high @xmath35 if no medium effects are present .",
    "in central collisions the yield is reduced of a factor 45 with respect to what expected for incoherent production in nucleon  nucleon collisions .",
    "another impressive result , obtained by star and phenix , is the disappearance of the back - to - back azimuthal correlations of high-@xmath35 particles in central au  au collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : starazi ] the azimuthal correlations of charged particles with respect to a high-@xmath35 trigger particle ( star markers ) in central au ",
    "au are shown and compared with reference data from pp collisions ( histogram ) : in central collisions the opposite - side ( @xmath37 ) correlation is strongly suppressed with respect to the pp and peripheral au  au cases .",
    "this effect suggests the absorption of one of the two jets ( usually produced as back - to - back pairs ) in the hot matter formed in central collisions .",
    "the effects of leading particle and jet suppression are not observed in d ",
    "au ( deuteron  gold ) collisions at @xmath16 ( circle and triangle markes in figs .",
    "[ fig : raa]-right and  [ fig : starazi ] ) , where the formation of a dense medium is not expected .    in summary , experiments at rhic have shown that a very dense qcd medium is formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "other measurements , namely elliptic flow and baryon - to - meson ratios , indicate that this medium is characterized by partonic degrees of freedom and that its expansion and cooling is well described by hydrodynamical models with high viscosity .",
    "thus , this medium is more similar to a liquid than to a gas of gluons and quarks .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) started operation with pp collisons at @xmath38 ( 2009 ) and 7  tev ( since march 2010 ) .",
    "the first pb  pb run , at @xmath39 , is scheduled for november 2010 .",
    "the maximum pb  pb energy of 5.5  tev should be reached in 2013 .",
    "lhc will provide nuclear collisions at a centre - of - mass energy 1530 times higher than at rhic , opening a new era for the field , in which particle production will be dominated by hard processes , and the energy densities will possibly be high enough to treat the generated quark - gluon plasma as an ideal gas .",
    "these qualitatively new features will allow to address the task of the lhc heavy ion program : a _ systematic study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma state .",
    "_    table  [ tab : spsrhiclhc ] presents a comparison of expected values for the most relevant parameters for sps , rhic and lhc energies  @xcite . at the lhc",
    ", the high energy in the collision centre of mass is expected to determine a large energy density and an initial temperature at least a factor 2 larger than at rhic .",
    "this high initial temperature extends also the life - time and the volume of the deconfined medium , since it has to expand while cooling down to the freeze - out temperature , which is @xmath40 ( it is independent of @xmath41 , above the sps energy ) .",
    "in addition , the large expected number of gluons favours energy and momentum exchanges , thus considerably reducing the time needed for the thermal equilibration of the medium . to summarize ,",
    "the lhc will produce _ hotter , larger and longer - living _ ` drops ' of qcd plasma than the previous heavy - ion facilities .",
    "the key advantage in this new ` deep deconfinement ' scenario is that the quark - gluon plasma studied by the lhc experiments will be much more similar to the quark - gluon plasma that can be investigated from a theoretical point of view by means of lattice qcd .",
    ".comparison of the parameters characterizing central   collisions at different energy regimes  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     heavy - ion collisions at the lhc access not only a quantitatively different regime of much higher energy density but also a qualitatively new regime ,",
    "mainly because :    _ high - density parton distributions _ are expected to dominate particle production .",
    "the number of low - energy partons ( mainly gluons ) in the two colliding nuclei is , therefore , expected to be so large as to produce a significant initial - state saturation that would be the dominant effect governing the bulk particle production .    _",
    "hard processes _ should contribute significantly to the total nucleus ",
    "nucleus cross section .",
    "the hard probes are at the lhc an ideal experimental tool for a detailed characterization of the qgp medium .",
    "three experiments will study pb  pb collisions at the lhc : alice ( the dedicated heavy - ion experiment ) , atlas , and cms .",
    "their excellent detector capabilities , with many complementary features , will allow to pursue an exciting heavy - ion physics program .",
    "as aforementioned , the goal of this program is a systematic study of the properties of the quark - gluon plasma state . in detail :    energy density of the hot and dense system produced in the collision , via measurement of the charged - particle multiplicity and charged - particle rapidity density .    temperature and baryon density of the system at the chemical freeze - out and temperature at the kinetic freeze - out , via measurement of identified - particle yields ( probe chemical freeze - out ) and momentum spectra ( probe kinetic freeze - out ) .",
