    "among widegap ii - vi semiconductors , zno seems to be one of the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications .",
    "this is due to its stable excitons , having a large binding energy of 59  mev  @xcite .",

    ", we reported the observation of intense near - band - edge photoluminescence ( pl ) for zno : ga at room temperature ( rt )  @xcite .",

    "p_-type doped materials .",

    "p_-type conductivity even using one of the best growth techniques that have ever reported [ a repeated - temperature modulation ( rtm ) technique ]  @xcite .",
    "it has become apparent that the `` standard '' theory formulated by thomas , hopfield , and augustyniak  @xcite ( hereafter , it is called a `` standard '' tha model ) is totally incapable of explaining results of the dap pl for heavily doped materials probably because this does not take the effects of inhomogeneity into account . in this work , to implement the effect of the fluctuation field inherent to the doped samples , we successfully grew _ p_-type - dopants - incorporated films , which are suitable for the experimental verification of the relevant `` fluctuation '' theory .",
    "we have grown gallium- and nitrogen - doped zno films grown by laser - molecular - beam epitaxy on lattice - matched scalmgo@xmath0 substrates .",
    "the detailed methods of fabrication have been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a very complicated growth sequence has been adopted for the nitrogen doping .",
    "we measured the photoluminescence ( pl ) of the doped zno layers in the band - edge region .",
    "the experimental procedures  @xcite were identical to those adopted in our previous study and their details were reported elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "pulsed excitation was provided for the time - resolved experiments with the frequency doubled beam of a picosecond mode - locked ti : sapphire laser .",
    "figure  [ fig : n - type](a ) shows pl spectra of zno : ga at four different doping levels ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the shape of the pl band is asymmetrical .",
    "the linewidths of the pl increase from 154 to 195  mev with an increase in ga concentration ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the `` theoretical '' broadening for the pl was evaluated in terms of potential fluctuations caused by the random distribution of donor impurities ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of our previous paper  @xcite ) .",

    ", there is a relationship between the stokes shift and the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of pl .",

    "figure  [ stokes ] shows a stokes shift of the luminescence plotted against the gallium concentration .",
    "obviously , the shift energy increases with incorporation of the donor dopants . the energy scale of the band potential profile fluctuation can be evaluated from the stokes shift and predict consistently the fwhm .",

    "the above - mentioned relationship is indicated as @xmath8 .",

    "the fwhms ( @xmath5 ) of the simulated pl spectra for the samples at four different doping levels are complied in table  i.    the simulated broadening ( @xmath5 ) is smaller than that of experiments as in the case of the simpler theoretical consideration .",
    "this difference is probably due to the contribution of the phonon replicas .",
    "in addition , the simulated line - shape is rather symmetrical , which is in great contrast to the asymmetrical shape observed in the experimental spectra .",
    "we think that the zero - phonon peak and its phonon replicas are not spectrally resolved well , leading to the larger experimental broadening .",

    "although the experimental verification for this theory has been performed in n - doped znse , it should be emphasized that only samples influenced by the very strong fluctuation fields have been analyzed  @xcite . in regard with this theory ,",
    "wide applicability on the magnitude of fluctuations has not been yet verified , which is the main focus of the present work .",

    "one of the reasons for the unexpectedly short decay compared to those in other semiconductors  @xcite is the difference in @xmath61 , because the decay becomes slower with increasing fluctuation .",
    "the other one is presumably related to the @xmath70 , which is one order of magnitude larger than that for znse , and may be inherent to zno .",

    "it should be , however , noted that this theoretical evaluation sensitively depends on the choice of zno material parameters adopted in the calculation of the bohr radii of donors and acceptors .",
    "we would like to say that the experimental value of @xmath86 is likely to be greater than 28  ev , the contention of which is based on the comparison of the values with other semiconductors and the strong excitonic effects of zno .",
