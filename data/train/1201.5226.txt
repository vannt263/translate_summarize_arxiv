    "<S> the degree of randomness , or partial order , present in two - dimensional supramolecular arrays of isophthalate tetracarboxylic acids is shown to vary due to subtle chemical changes such as the choice of solvent or small differences in molecular dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this variation may be quantified using an order parameter and reveals a novel phase behaviour including random tiling with varying critical properties as well as ordered phases dominated by either parallel or non - parallel alignment of neighbouring molecules , consistent with long - standing theoretical studies . the balance between order and randomness </S>",
    "<S> is driven by small differences in the intermolecular interaction energies , which we show , using numerical simulations , can be related to the measured order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> significant variations occur even when the energy difference is much less than the thermal energy highlighting the delicate balance between entropic and energetic effects in complex self - assembly processes .    </S>",
    "<S> two - dimensional molecular networks provide an attractive and highly flexible route to the formation of surfaces with specific structural arrangements and functionalities @xcite . within the broad range of structures that have been explored , </S>",
    "<S> random molecular networks have gained considerable attention recently as exemplars of two - dimensional , nonperiodic glassy systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these systems are of great interest , and represent examples of complex self - assembled sytems , a quantitative measure of the degree of randomness present in a molecular array , which is required for a theoretical understanding of their properties , is not generally available . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we report a set of supramolecular arrays in which the randomness varies due to small changes in chemical environment or molecular geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we define an order parameter which quantifies these variations and provides a systematic comparison between supramolecular arrays prepared using similar methodologies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the observed variations may be rationalised within a complex phase diagram which can be related to the adsorption of dimers on a periodic lattice@xcite , a paradigmatical problem in statistical mechanics which has been studied for several decades , and is a well - known example of a physical system which can be mapped onto a non - periodic tiling of the plane@xcite . in particular , using numerical simulations , we relate the order parameter to an orientational dependence of the intermolecular interactions which stabilise the network .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on molecular rhombus tilings formed at the liquid - solid interface following the deposition of solvated molecules of interest on highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) substrates . in recent work </S>",
    "<S> we have shown@xcite that such arrays support the formation of a random tiling , the first experimental realisation of the dimer adsorption problem . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular networks formed on graphite are imaged using scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) and the observed structures can be directly mapped onto rhombus tilings . in - plane </S>",
    "<S> stabilisation of the molecular networks arises from hydrogen bonds formed between carboxylic acid groups @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> several closely related molecules have been studied previously @xcite , but do not display an extended random tiling , although frustrated crystallisation has been observed@xcite . to tile the plane perfectly a rhombus must have internal angles of @xmath0 and @xmath6 , a lozenge @xcite , for which @xmath7 .        </S>",
    "<S> a random tiling is considered _ ideal _ when the energies of the non - parallel and parallel alignments , given by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , are degenerate , @xmath10 @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the tiling configuration is determined solely by maximising configurational entropy . </S>",
    "<S> such tilings possess no translational order and display correlations in tile orientation which have a logarithmic dependence on spatial separation , a signature of a ` coulomb ' phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if there is an energetic asymmetry , @xmath11 , the degeneracy between the exponentially large number of tilings is broken . in this case </S>",
    "<S> an additional internal energy contribution to the free energy competes with the entropic term ( rhombus tiles with asymmetric interactions are described as _ interacting _ in many theoretical models@xcite ) . for small @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> random tiling phases ( with properties which vary continuously with @xmath13 ) are expected , but large @xmath12 values are predicted to lead to transitions to ordered phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath12 may be considered to be analogous to the coupling constant @xmath14 which appears in ising models of magnetism and leads to ordered phases with broken symmetry for @xmath15 , which may be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the sign of @xmath14 , while entropic terms in the free energy dominate for @xmath16 in which case a paramagnetic phase occurs . </S>",

    "<S> we re - iterate the analogy with magnetic systems where transitions from disordered to ordered phases occur as the absolute value of the coupling constant is increased beyond some critical value .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from fig .  1 that different experimental conditions give rise to tilings with varying degrees of order . </S>",
    "<S> in experiment i we investigated dpbdtc in nonanoic acid ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this arrangement there are more parallel bonds than expected for an ideal random tiling and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> a solution of tptc in heptanoic acid ( exp . </S>",

    "<S> 1d ) results in a molecular tiling with @xmath35 . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the increase in temperature leads , as expected , to a value of @xmath25 closer to zero . finally , the most negative order parameter , @xmath41 , is observed when coronene ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these results show that small modifications in experimental parameters lead to the exploration of the rhombus tiling model phase space . to determine the placement of the experimental structures on the phase diagram in fig .  1b </S>",

    "<S> b * , concentration of defects as a function of bias . </S>",
    "<S> the full curve is the numerical result . </S>",

    "<S> 2a provide a relationship between the order parameter @xmath25 and @xmath43 which allow an estimation of the latter for each of our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using the known temperature at which the experiments were performed we can estimate values of @xmath13 , as tabulated in fig .  2c . a comparison of experiments iv and v is of particular interest : both were performed using tptc in nonanoic acid but with molecular networks prepared at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly we would anticipate the same value of @xmath13 and we find excellent agreement between the values inferred from simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides strong support for our analysis and confirmation that the molecular arrays can be understood in terms of equilibrium structures . from our experiments </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that measurable variations in the tiling statistics may be identified even for variations of @xmath13 of @xmath50  mev , much less than the thermal energy at room temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> a second experimental measure , which can also be compared with numerical results , is the concentration of defects . </S>",
    "<S> these ` half - rhombus ' vacancies are topological defects and are present in several of the images shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> for an ideal tiling their concentration , @xmath46 , has been shown to be temperature dependent @xcite ( we choose an effective temperature in our simulations to match , approximately , the maximum defect density observed in experiments ) and we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b that @xmath46 is also controlled by @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight the non - monotonic dependence on bias which results from the strong suppression of isolated triangular defects in the ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally - determined defect data is plotted against the theoretical curve using the value of @xmath51 obtained from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the non - monotonic behaviour and suppression of defect formation in the ordered phases is reproduced in our data thus providing further support of the validity of our approach to determine the value of @xmath13 for our experiments .        </S>",
    "<S> rhombus tilings are commonly analysed as a projection of the interface of a simple cubic lattice onto a ( 111 ) plane @xcite . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> each vertex is assigned an effective height @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the co - ordinates of the vertex ) using a simple procedure ( outlined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3j ) . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of our images using this approach shows explicitly the difference between random and ordered phases as shown in fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> here we show larger area images for experiments i , iv and vi , in three different representations . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the tiling representation , as in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  1 ( figs .  3a , 3d , and 3 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second representation is given by the height map @xmath52 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b , 3e , and 3h ) : experiment i shows a clear height gradient , fig .  3b , indicative of its closeness to the phase boundary to the parallel phase ; in contrast the height maps for experiments iv and vi , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3e and 3h , show averaged height gradients which are close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected for both the random and non - parallel ordered phase although these can be distinguished by the greater height fluctuations present for experiment iv consistent with a random tiling phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the third representation illustrates the spatial variation of non - parallel order . in a perfectly non - parallel configuration the unit cell ( e.g. see schematic inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) can be centred at any of the three sub - lattices of the triangular lattice . choosing a sublattice is the symmetry breaking associated with the transition to the non - parallel phase and in general we would expect to observe domains of non - parallel order corresponding to each of these three possible sub - lattices . </S>",
    "<S> again a magnetic analogue is useful ; in a ferromagnetic system domains of spin - up and spin - down magnetisation are formed whose size diverges as the system undergoes a transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic phase . for the case considered here </S>",
    "<S> there are three equivalent non - parallel ordered states into which the system can crystallise , rather than the two states available for a simple magnetic system . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c , 3f , and 3i regions of non - parallel aligned tiles are coloured cyan / yellow / magenta depending on their assignment to one of the three possible non - parallel phases . for experiment i , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c , these domains are relatively small since the parallel tile alignment predominates . </S>",
    "<S> the domains are larger but finite for experiment iv , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3f , in the random tiling phase . </S>",
    "<S> for experiment vi , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3i , one domain has become dominant and is comparable with the size of the system , indicative of a transition to the non - parallel phase .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show conclusively that the phase space of two - dimensional rhombus tiles , which arises from asymmetric interactions , may be explored experimentally through the structural characterisation of molecular arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in energy which give rise to different ordering are small compared to the thermal energy , an essential requirement for systems where entropy is significant . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the characteristic energetic bias , @xmath13 , on solvent indicates that the effective energetic difference between parallel and non - parallel molecular pairs adsorbed on graphite can not be simply described by the interactions between two tetracarboxylic acid molecules and must include other more complex contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight two possible influences of the solvent molecules on the effective interaction between adsorbed molecules . </S>",
    "<S> firstly the co - adsorption of solvent molecules on the graphite surface is possible@xcite , and expected , since the the network of tetracarboxylic acid molecules results in an array of nanopores which can accommodate guest molecules . as shown in a recent paper@xcite these nanopores are hexagonal and may be classified into five inequivalent types which are formed from different combinations of parallel and non - parallel bonded molecular pairs . </S>",
    "<S> there is a significant variation of the capture of guest molecules in pores of different type@xcite , and we therefore also expect variations in the stabilisation energies of the co - adsorption of solvent molecules in different pore types . since the energy of co - adsorbed molecules makes a contribution to the overall stability@xcite of a given pore , this effect provides a mechanism to break the degeneracy of the different pore types . </S>",
    "<S> since different pores are formed by different combinations of parallel and non - paralell pairs , variations in guest inclusion stability will result in small effective energetic differences between the parallel and non - parallel molecular orientations . </S>",
    "<S> a second consideration is that the solvents provide an effective medium with varying dielectric constant , as pointed out for these particular molecules by kampschulte _ </S>",
    "<S> et.al._@xcite , which would give rise to a solvent dependence of any energetic imbalance mediated , for example , by van der waals interactions , or hydrogen - bonding , between neighbouring molecules ( see cook et.al.@xcite for a discussion of solvent effects on intermolecular interactions in a solution environment ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a complete microscopic description of energy differences on this scale are beyond the confidence levels normally associated with modern numerical approaches to molecular modelling ( e.g. density functional theory , molecular dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the inclusion of solvent molecules makes a detailed microscopic description and prediction of energies particularly problematic . </S>",
    "<S> however , our experiments give clear limits on the tolerance of the random tiling phase to symmetry breaking - a difference in binding energies of @xmath55mev will drive the structures into an ordered phase .    </S>",
    "<S> our study demonstrates that prototypical self - assembled systems such as supramolecular networks can reveal a richness of exotic phases which have been studied widely by theorists and are analogous to those found in complex condensed - matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> in addition our work highlights the role of entropy in the balance between order and disorder in molecular templates . </S>"
