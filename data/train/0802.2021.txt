    "in the last few years , it has become increasingly clear that supermassive black holes ( bh ) are an essential element in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the key observational evidence of a link between a bh and its host galaxy is provided by the tight correlations between bh mass and luminosity , mass , velocity dispersion and surface brightness profile of the host spheroids ( @xcite ) .",
    "the link between bh and host galaxy is probably established by the feedback of the accreting bh , i.e.  the active galactic nucleus , on the host galaxy itself ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) .    in order to fully understand the implications of bh growth on the evolution of the host galaxies",
    "it is fundamental to measure bh masses in large samples of galaxies from zero to high redshifts .",
    "direct bh mass estimates based on stellar and gas kinematics are possible only in the local universe and their complexity does not allow their application to large samples ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". the limit of the local universe can be overcome with the reverberation mapping ( rm ) technique ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) which provides an estimate of the broad line region ( blr ) average distance from the bh ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the bh mass can thus be derived using the virial theorem , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the width of the broad emission line and @xmath8 is a scaling factor which depends on the physical properties of the blr ( e.g.  @xcite ) . although this technique is potentially plagued by many unknown systematic errors ( @xcite;@xcite ) , bh masses from reverberation mappping are in agreement with the @xmath2-@xmath3  relation of normal galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . however , this technique is very demanding in terms of telescope time and it can be applied only to a few objects especially at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the radius - luminosity relation discovered by @xcite shows that continuum luminosity can be used as a proxy for @xmath5   ( @xcite ) . from the spectrum of a broad line agn",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain a single epoch ( se ) bh mass estimate .",
    "one of the most important sources of uncertainty in virial @xmath2  estimates is the scaling factor @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite have provided an estimate of @xmath8 assuming that the agn in the rm database of @xcite follow the @xmath2-@xmath3  relation of normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath8 by @xcite is only applicable to estimates of the virial product based on rm ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "building on the results by @xcite , @xcite have calibrated scaling relations for se virial @xmath2  estimates which combine the width of broad @xmath9  with the luminosities of @xmath10  at 5100 .",
    "overall , se virial estimates are commonly used to estimate bh masses in large sample of galaxies from zero to high redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite ) and are deemed accurate only from a statistical point of view on large samples of objects since a single measurement can be wrong even by a factor of @xmath11 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there are three important considerations which are suggested by the results presented in the above papers .",
    "first , se virial bh masses of a few objects ( e.g.  high @xmath12 , high @xmath13 quasars or narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ) imply they radiate near or above the eddington limit .",
    "the virial theorem is based on the assumption that the system is gravitationally bound and this might be violated in super - eddington sources where the outward force due to radiation pressure overcomes gravitational attraction .",
    "second , even when @xmath14 , one should take into account that the radiation force partially compensates gravitational attraction . in the standard accretion disk model ,",
    "the source of ionizing photons can be considered point - like at the distance of the blr ( see however @xcite for a different point of view ) and the radiation force scales as @xmath15 mirroring the radial dependence of the bh gravitational attraction .",
    "thus blr clouds are effectively being pulled by a smaller effective bh mass and all present virial mass estimates for objects close to their eddington limit , where radiation pressure is not considered , might be underestimated . finally , the eddington limit is computed assuming that the radiation pressure is due only to thomson scattering of photons by free electrons . as supported by reverberation mapping , by the radius - luminosity relation and other observational evidences",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , blr clouds are almost certainly photoionized .",
    "thus blr clouds are subject to radiation forces arising from the deposition of momentum by ionizing photons which can substantially exceed that due to scattering .",
    "the importance of radiation pressure due to ionizing photons and its possible effects on virial bh masses has already been mentioned in a few papers ( e.g.  @xcite ) but seem to have not been considered in detail subsequently .",
    "this effect might be particularly important in narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies which are believed to accrete close to their eddington limit .",
    "indeed , they are characterized by small bh masses compared to other agns and to the @xmath2-@xmath4/@xmath3  relations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been noted that the distance of nls1 galaxies from the @xmath2-@xmath4/@xmath3  relations is larger for objects with larger eddington ratios ( @xcite ) suggesting that smaller bhs are growing faster .",
    "alternatively , this might be an indication that that virial bh mass are underestimated in the high @xmath16 regime .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of radiation pressure on virial bh mass estimates . in ",
    "[ sec : physics ] we present a simple physical model for the radiation pressure effect on virial bh mass estimates . in   [ sec : observations ] we calibrate the effect of radiation pressure on virial bh masses adapting the procedures of @xcite and @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : nls1 ] we apply our corrected virial bh mass estimates to narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and show that these galaxies are indeed consistent with the @xmath2-@xmath3/@xmath4  relations , showing that bhs are not abnormally small .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and draw our conclusions in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the ratio between virial bh masses taking into account radiation pressure ( @xmath2 ) and those based only on the virial product ( @xmath17 ) is plotted against the classical eddington ratio based on @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath2/@xmath17  is thus the correction factor which should be applied to bh mass estimates based only on the virial product .",
    "@xmath18  is , on average , the total column density of each blr cloud along the direction to the ionizing source . ]",
    "we will explore the effect of radiation pressure on blr clouds using a simplified model which assumes that ( i ) each cloud is optically thick to ionizing photons but optically thin to scattering processes , ( ii ) the thomson cross - section is representative of all scattering processes involving free or bound electrons and ( iii ) both recombination and scattered photons are isotropically re - emitted .",
    "these assumptions are valid if @xmath19 where @xmath18  is the total cloud column density along the direction to the ionizing source , @xmath20 is the ionization parameter , @xmath21 is the case - b recombination coefficient for hydrogen and @xmath22  is the thomson cross - section . for typical conditions in the blr ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath25 . the total force acting on a cloud in the outward radial direction and due to radiation pressure",
    "is @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the luminosity of the agn continuum emission , @xmath28 is the cloud distance from the ionizing source , @xmath29 is the optical depth of absorption / scattering processes and @xmath30 is the cloud surface exposed to the agn radiation . scattering is important only for non - ionizing photons therefore , under the above assumptions , it is possible to write : @xmath31 where the two terms are the radiation forces due to absorption of ionizing photons and thomson scattering , respectively , @xmath32 is the total luminosity of the agn ionizing continuum , @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath18  is , on average , the total column density of each blr cloud along the direction to the ionizing source .",
    "the contribution to the radiation force from the absorption of line photons is negligible for the optically thick clouds considered here ( see , e.g. , the seminal paper by @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the total radiation force acting on each cloud and assuming that the blr is a bound system , it is possible to derive a modified version of the classical virial theorem which takes into account radiation as well as gravitational forces . approximating the cloud mass as @xmath34",
    "the modified expression for the virial bh mass @xmath2 is : @xmath35{{\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a geometrical factor which takes into account the geometry of the blr , @xmath36 is the classical eddington luminosity for a solar mass object and @xmath37 .",
    "this expression has a physical meaning as long as the system is bound , i.e.  as long as the radiation force on blr clouds is smaller than gravity . in formulae",
    "@xmath38}\\ ] ] where @xmath39  is the classical eddington luminosity . neglecting momentum injection by ionizing photons ( @xmath40 )",
    "we recover the classical relation @xmath41 . using @xmath2  from eq .",
    "[ eq : mvircorr ] to compute @xmath39 , it should be noticed that for @xmath42 , @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 will always be less than or equal to 1 .",
    "this is a consequence of the assumption of gravitationally bound blr which allowed us to write eq .",
    "[ eq : mvircorr ] .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to establish whether a system is above eddington by using virial bh mass estimates , since they are themselves based on the assumption of a sub - eddington system .    in order to quantify the effect of the radiation force correction we write",

    "the @xmath47 bolometric correction has been computed following @xcite and is on average @xmath48 in the @xmath49 luminosity range . for @xmath18=@xmath50@xmath51@xmath52  and @xmath53",
    ", @xmath2/@xmath17  varies between 2 and 10",
    ". this can be much larger for smaller column densities of blr clouds but values at low @xmath18  should be taken with caution since the adopted formula is valid only if the cloud is optically thick to ionizing photons , i.e.  @xmath54 .",
    "the correction factor remains small ( @xmath55 ) only for column densities @xmath56 .",
    "clearly the correcting factor critically depends on the @xmath18  value which sets the total cloud mass and thus the relative importance of gravitational attraction with respect to radiation pressure .",
    "overall , this figure suggest that neglecting the effect of radiation pressure might result in @xmath2  values which are underestimated even by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "virial estimates of bh masses are based on the assumption that the blr is gravitationally bound to the bh and that outflowing motions are negligible . in recent years , building upon observational evidence for outflows in the blr , alternative models have been proposed in which part of the blr is in the form of a disk wind ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this possibility has generated a debate about the reliability of virial bh masses ( e.g.  @xcite ) which is beyond the scope of this paper . nevertheless , virial bh mass estimators are widely used , and in order to investigate the effect of radiation pressure on such estimates , we must necessarily start from the same set of assumptions for our simple model .",
    "the simple physical approach presented in the previous sections suggests that virial bh mass estimates can be written as a function of observed quantities as @xmath58 where @xmath59  represents @xmath10  at 5100 .",
    "after eq .",
    "[ eq : mvircorr ] , @xmath60 corresponds to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bolometric correction at 5100 .",
    "following @xcite , the @xmath63 bolometric correction is on average @xmath64 in the @xmath49 luminosity range . @xmath8 and @xmath60 are free unknown parameters which depend on the physical and geometrical properties of the blr . in particular",
    "the @xmath60 factor critically depends on the assumed @xmath18  value which determines the cloud mass and thus sets the relative importance of gravity and radiation pressure .",
    "a correction for the radiation force which is proportional to @xmath13 is more general than the simple physical model presented in the previous section therefore , in order to avoid _ a - priori _",
    "assumptions on the values of the physical parameters characterizing blr clouds , we can determine @xmath8 and @xmath60 following a procedure similar to @xcite and @xcite . thus our model will only provide a simple physical interpretation of the empirical @xmath60 values .",
    "@xcite considered the agns from the reverberation mapping database by @xcite with measured stellar velocity dispersion .",

    "we now test whether nls1 galaxies indeed lie below the @xmath2-@xmath3/@xmath4  relations .",

    "when radiation pressure is taken into account in virial bh mass estimates , this tendency disappears or is strongly reduced .",

    "finally , although it is not possible to establish whether a system is emitting above eddington using virial bh masses ( see   [ sec : physics ] ) , the average increase of bh masses by 0.5 - 0.7 dex in nls1 galaxies ( from the @xcite and @xcite samples , respectively ) implies a similar decrease of their classical @xmath44 ratios .",

    ".    we have re - calibrated virial bh masses based on reverberation mapping data and single epoch spectra following a procedure analogous to @xcite and @xcite . with the caveat that it is difficult to accurately quantify the importance of radiation pressure with the present data , we find consistent values for the radiation pressure correction which",

    "this value is remarkably consistent with the blr cloud column density required in photoionization models to explain the observed spectra .",

    "we have considered our newly calibrated virial bh mass relations for narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and we have shown that , after taking into account radiation pressure , those galaxies seem to have bh masses similar to that of other broad line agns and and which follow the same @xmath2-@xmath3,@xmath4  relations as normal galaxies .",
