    "even a tiny perturbation of the hamiltonian of a quantum systems may significantly alter its time evolution .",

    "the le equals 1 at @xmath7 and is typically smaller than 1 at @xmath8 . over the past two decades ,",
    "the time decay of the le has been addressed , both experimentally and theoretically , in a large variety of quantum systems with non - trivial , complex dynamics , and has been proven an invaluable tool in understanding dynamical properties of these systems .",
    "a vast body of literature on the subject is summarized in review articles @xcite .",
    "most of the attention on the le has been directed at quantum systems whose dynamics is chaotic in the classical limit .",
    "this has to do with the existence of a parametric regime , commonly referred to as the lyapunov regime , in which the le of a chaotic quantum system decays exponentially in time , with the decay rate given by the average lyapunov exponent of the underlying classical system @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov regimes makes the le a valuable tool for identifying signatures of chaotic behaviour in the dynamics of quantum systems .    in integrable ( regular ) systems , unlike in chaotic systems",
    ", the decay of the le remains far less understood .",
    "two robust decay regimes have been established analytically and observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the first regime is characterized by a gaussian decay of the le , @xmath9 .",
    "it occurs under sufficiently weak hamiltonian perturbations and takes place on a time scale inversely proportional to the perturbation strength @xcite .",
    "the second regime exhibits an algebraic decay of the le , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the algebraic decay occurs when the hamiltonian perturbation is sufficiently strong and varies rapidly along a typical classical trajectory of the system @xcite . in general",
    ", however , the time decay of the le in integrable systems is non - monotonic , may be accompanied by revivals @xcite and intervals of temporary freeze @xcite , and may exhibit sharp minima and maxima on short time scales @xcite .    surprisingly , numerical simulations have shown that , in addition to the gaussian and algebraic decays , integrable systems may also exhibit exponential decay of the le @xcite .",
    "this finding may seem unexpected as the exponential decay of the le is normally regarded as a hallmark of chaotic dynamics . to our knowledge , there is currently no theoretical model able to quantitatively explain exponential decay of the le in integrable systems .    in this paper",
    ", we show analytically that exponential decay of the le may occur even in the simplest , one - dimensional integrable systems . for such systems ,",
    "we derive an explicit formula giving the exponential decay rate in terms of spectral characteristics of the unperturbed and perturbed hamilton operators and the initial state .",
    "in particular , we show that the decay rate is directly proportional to the strength of the hamiltonian perturbation .",
    "this linear dependence is to be compared with the corresponding rate - vs - strength dependence in the case of chaotic dynamics : under weak perturbations , the decay rate is quadratic in the perturbation strength ( the fermi - golden - rule regime ) @xcite , while under strong perturbations , the decay rate is independent of the perturbation strength ( the lyapunov regime ) @xcite . finally , using an example system",
