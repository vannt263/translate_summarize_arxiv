    "the motivation of this work is to understand the multiplicities of a representation of a torus @xmath1 in the virtual representation space @xmath4 obtained as the index of a @xmath1-invariant , elliptic or more generally transversally elliptic , pseudo - differential operator @xmath5 , in terms of the symbol . for basic definitions and results we refer to the lecture notes of atiyah ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we shall restrict to the case of a torus @xmath1 ( with lie algebra @xmath6 ) acting on a vector space ( to some extent this is the essential case ) .",
    "let @xmath7 be the lattice of characters of @xmath1 , and for @xmath8 , we denote by @xmath9 the corresponding function on @xmath1 . according to the theory of atiyah - singer ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , in the case of a transversally elliptic operator , @xmath10 and @xmath11 might be infinite dimensional , but the multiplicity of a character is finite and the difference of the two multiplicities in @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the fourier coefficient of the generalized function @xmath12 on @xmath1 .",
    "we thus obtain a function @xmath13 on @xmath7 so that @xmath14 .",
    "we call @xmath13 the multiplicity index map .",
    "a cohomological formula for the equivariant index of elliptic operators was obtained by atiyah - bott - segal - singer . using integrals of equivariant cohomology classes , a formula for the equivariant index of transversally elliptic operators",
    "was obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these formulae define ( generalized ) functions on @xmath1 in terms of the chern character of the symbol of @xmath5",
    ". however , the behavior of multiplicities is our main interest .",
    "remark that , even in the case of elliptic operators where we deal with finite dimensional representations , a `` formula '' for the multiplicities is not easy to deduce from the atiyah - bott - segal - singer fixed point formulae , as @xmath15 is given by different formulae for each @xmath16 .",
    "a similar drawback of the formulae of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is that for each @xmath16 , they are defined only on a neighborhood of @xmath17 ( and with different formulae for each @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus known formulae for the equivariant index were not adapted to the study of the fourier transform .",
    "our point of view is new . instead of functions on @xmath1 ,",
    "we consider directly the multiplicity index of an operator @xmath5 as a function on @xmath18 .",
    "similarly we associate directly to the chern character of the symbol of @xmath5 a spline function on @xmath19 . here",
    "splines ( called also multisplines in several variables ) are the familiar objects in approximation theory : piecewise polynomial functions with respect to a polyhedral subdivision of @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our main theorem ( theorem [ final ] ) says ( essentially ) that the multiplicity index is the restriction of a suitable spline function to @xmath7 , a lattice in @xmath19 .",
    "our inspiration comes from the `` continuous analogue '' of the index : the duistermaat - heckman measure , a piecewise polynomial function on @xmath19 and from the ",
    "quantization commutes with reduction \" results on multiplicities of twisted dirac operators .",
    "the key point of our approach are explicit computations of the index of some transversally elliptic operators in terms of vector partition functions .",
    "we construct two piecewise polynomial functions , one obtained from the multiplicity index and box splines , the other from the chern character using our theory of the infinitesimal index @xcite and we compare them on generators .",
    "finally , our final theorem ( theorem [ final ] ) follows from a remarkable inversion formula , basically due to dahmen - micchelli @xcite , for multisplines .",
    "let us first recall the basic formalism of our approach . let @xmath21 be a complex vector space with a linear action of @xmath1 where @xmath22 is a character and @xmath23 denotes the corresponding 1dimensional representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the vector partition function @xmath24 , a function on @xmath7 which describes the multiplicity of the action of the torus @xmath1 on polynomial functions on @xmath2 is approximated by a multispline distribution @xmath25 : the convolution of the heaviside functions associated to the half line @xmath26 , where @xmath27 runs through the sequence @xmath28 of weights of @xmath1 in @xmath2 ( we assume here in the introduction that all weights @xmath27 are on one side of a half - space and span @xmath20 ) . the locally polynomial measure @xmath25 on @xmath20 is the duistermaat - heckman measure of the hamiltonian vector space @xmath29 .    in approximation theory ,",
    "one introduces another special distribution _ the box spline @xmath30 _ defined as convolution of the intervals @xmath31a$ ] ( thought of as measures or distributions ) .",
    "an immediate relation between @xmath24 and @xmath30 is the fact that the convolution of the box spline @xmath30 with the partition function @xmath24 is the multispline @xmath25 .",
    "the todd operator , an infinite series of constant coefficients differential operators , acts on spline functions .",
    "it enters naturally in the `` deconvolution '' formula , leading to the `` riemann - roch formula '' for @xmath24 in function of @xmath25 ( at least in the special case of @xmath28 unimodular ) : we apply a series of constant coefficient operators to the piecewise polynomial function @xmath25 and then restrict it to the lattice . in this way",
    "we obtain the vector partition function @xmath24 .    these algebraic formulae are well - known : cf .",
    "khovanskii - pukhlikov @xcite , dahmen - micchelli @xcite , brion - vergne @xcite , de concini  procesi @xcite",
    "and they are equivalent to the riemann - roch theorem for line bundles over toric varieties .",
    "our aim in this article is to show that the same deconvolution formula allows us to compute the index of any transversally elliptic operator on @xmath29 in function of a piecewise polynomial function on @xmath20 associated to its symbol by applying to it the todd differential operator .",
    "let @xmath2 be a manifold , @xmath32 its cotangent bundle and @xmath33 the canonical projection .",
    "given now a pseudo differential operator @xmath5 between the sections of two vector bundles @xmath34 , one constructs its symbol @xmath35 which is a bundle map @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath2 has a @xmath1 action , we denote by @xmath37 the closed subset of @xmath32 , union of the conormals to the @xmath1 orbits .",
    "then a @xmath1equivariant pseudodifferential operator @xmath5 is called @xmath1-transversally elliptic if the symbol @xmath38 restricted to @xmath37 minus the zero section is an isomorphism of bundles .",
    "the symbol @xmath39 of the pseudo - differential transversally elliptic operator @xmath5 on @xmath2 determines two topological objects :    \\1 ) an element of the equivariant @xmath40theory group @xmath41    \\2 ) the chern character @xmath42 of @xmath38 , which is an element of the @xmath1-equivariant cohomology with compact supports of @xmath37 .",
    "the index of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath12 , depends only on the symbol and defines a map from @xmath43 to the space of generalized functions on @xmath1 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath12 is the multiplicity index map @xmath13 , a function on @xmath44 .    in @xcite , we have associated to @xmath42 a distribution on @xmath19 , its infinitesimal index , denoted @xmath45 .",
    "assume now that @xmath2 is a real vector space with a linear action of @xmath1 .",
    "the list of weights of @xmath1 in the complex vector space @xmath46 is @xmath47 for some list @xmath48 .",
    "for simplicity assume that @xmath28 generates @xmath19 .    for any @xmath49",
    ", we prove that the distribution @xmath45 is piecewise polynomial on @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore ( theorem [ theo : boxindex ] ) , the following identity of locally @xmath50-functions of @xmath51 holds    @xmath52    in other words , @xmath45 is ( up to a multiplicative constant ) the spline function obtained from convoluting a box spline with the discrete measure @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to check this formula on the atiyah symbols @xmath54 , and these elements generate the @xmath55-module @xmath56 . in some sense , as explained in part 2 , this formula is the fourier transform of the formulae of berline - paradan - vergne .",
    "apply the todd operator associated to @xmath47 to the spline function @xmath57 .",
    "we obtain again a spline function @xmath58 on @xmath19 .",
    "our final result ( theorem [ final ] ) says essentially that the restriction of this function @xmath58 to @xmath7 is the multiplicity index .",
    "this follows from a `` deconvolution '' formula for splines functions produced by convolution with box splines .",
    "@xmath59 in part 1 , we recall some results obtained by dahmen - micchelli in the purely combinatorial context of the semi - discrete convolution with the box spline .",
    "let @xmath60 $ ] be a finite list of vectors in a vector space @xmath61 .",
    "the box spline @xmath30 is the image measure of the hypercube @xmath31^n$ ] by the map @xmath62 .",
    "we assume next that @xmath28 span a lattice @xmath7 .",
    "convoluting a discrete measure supported on the lattice @xmath7 by @xmath30 produces a locally polynomial function on @xmath61 .",
    "the first step is to prove a _ deconvolution formula_. define the todd operator @xmath63 .",
    "then we prove in theorem [ theo : inversionuni ] that , if we apply ( in an appropriate sense ) the todd operator @xmath64 to the box spline and restrict to the lattice , we obtain the @xmath65 function of the lattice @xmath7 in the case of a unimodular system ( a slightly more complicated formula is obtained for any @xmath28 ) :    @xmath66    we prove this result using our knowledge of the dahmen - micchelli spaces ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we show that khovanskii - pukhlikov formula and more generally brion - vergne formula for the partition function @xmath24 is a particular case of the deconvolution formula .",
    "@xmath59 in part 2 , we consider @xmath67 as a real @xmath1-manifold , we recall our description of @xmath68 as well as @xmath69 as vector spaces of distributions , on the dual of the group @xmath1 or on the dual of its lie algebra @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "we compute the infinitesimal index of the chern character of the atiyah symbol @xmath54 and descent formulae associated to a finite subset of elements of @xmath16 .",
    "we use all these ingredients to give a general formula , in , for the index of a transversally elliptic operator @xmath5 in function of the infinitesimal index of the chern character of the symbol of @xmath5 .",
    "as we already pointed out , our results are motivated by previous results of berline - vergne , and paradan - vergne .",
    "but our point of view is dual .",
    "we work with functions on @xmath18 or @xmath20 .",
