    "understanding the origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been a perplexing problem since they were first detected almost three decades ago @xcite . the fact that grbs are distributed isotropically",
    "@xcite suggests a cosmological origin .",
    "furthermore , arcminute burst locations from bepposax have revealed that at least some @xmath2-ray bursts involve weak x - ray , optical , or radio transients , and are of cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the mg i absorption and [ o ii ] emission lines along the line of sight from the grb970508 optical transient , for example , indicate a redshift @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the implied distance means that this burst must have released of order @xmath4 ergs in @xmath2-rays on a time scale @xmath5 seconds .",
    "this energy requirement has been rendered even more demanding by other events such as grb971214 @xcite which appears to be centered on a galaxy at redshift 3.42 .",
    "this implies that the energy of a @xmath6 burst would have to be as much as @xmath7 ergs , comparable to the visible light output of @xmath8 galaxies .",
    "based upon the accumulated evidence one can can now conclude that the following four features probably characterize the source environment : 1 ) if the total burst energies are in the range of @xmath9 ergs , then a beaming factor of 10 to 100 is necessary ; 2 ) the multiple peak temporal structure of most bursts probably requires either multiple colliding shocks @xcite or a single shock impinging upon a clumpy interstellar medium @xcite ; 3 ) the observed afterglows imply some surrounding material on a scale of light hours ; and 4 ) the presence of [ o ii ] emission lines suggests that the bursts occur in a young , metal - enriched stellar population .",
    "some proposed sources for the production of grbs include accretion onto supermassive black holes , agn s , relativistic stellar collisions , hypernovae , and binary neutron star coalescence .",
    "each of these possibilities , however , remain speculative until realistic models can be constructed for their evolution . in this paper",
    "we construct a model for grbs produced by energetic neutrino emission from a heated neutron star .",
    "our specific model for the emission derives from the relativistic compression and heating of neutron stars near their last stable orbit , however any scenario by which energetic neutrino emission above a neutron star can endure for several seconds ( e.g. tidal heating , mhd induced heating , accretion shocks , etc ) might also power the gamma - ray burst paradigm described herein .",
    "our model is as follows .",
    "a compressionally heated neutron star emits thermal neutrino pairs which , in turn , annihilate to produce a hot electron - positron pair plasma .",
    "we model the expansion of the plasma with a spherically symmetric relativistic hydrodynamics computer program .",
    "this simplification is justified at this stage of the calculations since the rotational velocity of the stars is about one third of the sound speed in the @xmath10 pair plasma .",
    "we then analyze and compare the contributions of photons from @xmath10 pair annihilation as well as from an external synchrotron shock as the plasma plows into the interstellar medium .",
    "we show that the characteristic features of grbs , i.e. total energy , duration and gamma - ray spectrum , can be accounted for in the context of this model .",
    "it has been speculated for some time that inspiraling neutron stars could provide a power source for cosmological gamma - ray bursts .",
    "however , previous newtonian and post newtonian studies @xcite of the final merger of two neutron stars have found that the neutrino emission time scales are so short that it would be difficult to drive a gamma - ray burst from this source .",
    "it is clear that a mechanism is required for extending the duration of energetic neutrino emission .",
    "a number of possibilities could be envisioned , for example , neutrino emission powered by accretion shocks , mhd or tidal interactions between the neutron stars , etc .",
    "the present study , however , has been primarily motivated by numerical studies of the strong field relativistic hydrodynamics of close neutron - star binaries in three spatial dimensions .",
    "these studies @xcite suggest that neutron stars in a close binary can experience relativistic compression and heating over a period of seconds . during the compression phase",
    "released gravitational binding energy can be converted into internal energy .",
    "subsequently , up to @xmath11 ergs in thermally produced neutrinos can be emitted before the stars collapse @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the physical basis of this model and numerically explore its consequences for the development of an @xmath10 plasma and associated grb .    in @xcite properties of equal - mass neutron - star binaries",
    "were computed as a function of mass and eos ( equation of state ) . from these studies",
    "it was deduced that compression , heating and collapse could occur at times from a few seconds to tens of seconds before binary merger .",
    "our calculation of the rates of released binding energy and neutron star cooling suggests that interior temperatures as hot as 70 mev are achieved .",
    "this leads to a high neutrino luminosity which peaks at @xmath12 ergs sec@xmath13 .",
    "this much neutrino luminosity would partially convert to an @xmath10 pair plasma above the stars as is also observed above the nascent neutron star in supernova simulations @xcite .",
    "we should point out , however , that many papers have been published claiming the compression is nonexistent .",
    "in @xcite we presented a rebuttal to the critics .",
    "subsequently , however , @xcite pointed out a spurious term in our formula for the momentum constraint .",
    "we @xcite have corrected the momentum constraint equation and redone a sequence of calculations for a binary neutron star system with various angular momenta .",
    "a compression effect still exists which is able to release @xmath14 - @xmath11 ergs of gravitational binding energy .",
    "the compression does not occur for corotating stars with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "for irrotational binary stars our compression effect is consistent with the results of at least two other groups @xcite using different numerical methods to compute the relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations were done with a polytropic equation of state and found only very small compression ; much less than 1% . for",
    "the polytropic equation of state @xcite also found a compression less than 1% . in simulations with the realistic , somewhat soft",
    ", eos described below we found clear evidence @xcite that significant compression , heating and collapse still occurs for sufficiently close orbits .",
    "the reason for this eos dependence is straightforward .",
    "table [ eostable ] shows the realistic eos used in the present work and the @xcite studies .",
    "the key difference between the polytropic and realistic eoss is that the adiabatic index @xmath15 is not constant but decreases at low density for a realistic eos .",
    "this causes the outer regions of the star to be more compact , and therefore , less affected by tidal stabilization than for polytropes . at the same time",
    ", the maximum central density tends to be larger for a neutron star of a fixed baryon mass . therefore the relativistic effects are more dramatic when a realistic eos is employed .",
    "the hydrodynamic calculations that demonstrate compression have been made with the stars constrained to remain at zero temperature ( i.e. efficient radiators ) .",
    "as the compression rate increases , however , it is expected that the rate of released binding energy will exceed the ability of the star to radiate and internal heating will result .",
    "large scale off - center vortices are observed to form @xcite within the stars with a characteristic circulation time scale of @xmath16 sec .",
    "the maximum velocities are nearly sonic . among other things ,",
    "this circulatory motion should help dissipate the compressional motion into thermal energy by shocks thereby heating the interior of the stars .",
    "we have run several sets of calculations with realistic neutron - star equations of state .",
    "we first considered stars like our earlier bench mark cases @xcite with a baryon mass of 1.548 @xmath17 corresponding to a typical ( cf .",
    "appendix a ) gravitational mass of m@xmath18 = 1.39 m@xmath19 and a central density of @xmath20 g @xmath21 in isolation .",
    "these stars are based upon the `` realistic '' eos of table [ eostable ] for which the maximum critical mass is @xmath22 m@xmath19 .",
    "as summarized in appendix a , this maximum mass is typical of the somewhat soft eos s in which relativistic particles and/or condensates have been included .",
    "parameters for this eos were motivated by the necessity of such a soft eos to obtain the correct neutrino signal in simulations of sn 1987a ( wilson & mayle 1993 ) .",
    "as noted in table 5 of the appendix this maximum mass is consistent with the measured masses of all binary pulsar systems for which the orbits have been well determined .",
    "as noted above , the stars calculated using this realistic eos show significant compression and released binding energy before inspiral but do not individually collapse .",
    "the released gravitational energy from this calculation is summarized in table [ tableheat ] . even without the collapse instability enough internal heating occurs to produce a significant gamma - ray burst .",
    "we also found @xcite that the individual collapse of stars would occur if the stars are increased in mass from m@xmath23 to 1.44 m@xmath19 ( m@xmath24 m@xmath19 ) for this eos .",
    "collapse of this star system is observed to occur for very close separation ( @xmath25 ) near ( but before ) the final stable orbit .",
    "thus , collapse is a reasonable possibility for typical masses and a moderately soft eos .",
    "for example , collapse would always occur prior to inspiral for stars in the typically observed mass range modeled with the eos of @xcite . for a critical mass of 1.54 , even stars of initial mass of 1.35 collapse before reaching the innermost stable orbit .",
    "based upon the above results , we model the thermal energy deposition due to neutron star compression as follows : we expect that the fluid motion within the stars will quickly convert released gravitational binding energy into thermal energy in the interior of the stars .",
    "thus , we estimate that the rate of thermal energy deposition is comparable to the rate of released binding energy due to compression . the amount of released binding energy scales with the orbital four velocity @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the rate of increase of the orbital four velocity can be obtained @xcite from the gravitational radiation timescale .",
    "then , from the relation between released binding energy and increasing four velocity @xcite , the energy deposition rate into the stars can be deduced in approximate analytic form @xcite .",
    "we write , @xmath26^{3/2}}~~ , \\label{jay : e : energydot}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the orbital angular frequency and @xmath28 is the total thermal energy deposited into the stars . in the hydrodynamic pair plasma discussions below we consider a range of deposited thermal energy of @xmath29 , @xmath14 , @xmath11 ergs , consistent with the hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the end of energy deposition when the neutron stars either have collapsed into two black holes or have reached the last stable orbit and collapsed to a single black hole . at the time that a typical neutron star binary system is near the last stable obit , the orbital frequency is @xmath5 a few@xmath32 sec@xmath13 .",
    "hence , by equation ( [ jay : e : energydot ] ) , the energy deposition rate would be @xmath33 thus , for @xmath34 ergs , @xmath35 ergs sec@xmath13 .",
    "the magnitude of the neutrino luminosity is very critical since the subsequent fireball is formed by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation . in order to model the thermal energy emitted by neutrinos before either stellar or orbital collapse",
    "we have constructed a computer model which treats the diffusion of energy in a static neutron star .",
    "this energy transport occurs by a combination of neutrino diffusion plus energy diffusion via a convective velocity - dependent diffusion coefficient . for the neutrino energy diffusion",
    "we write : @xmath36 where the coefficient for neutrino diffusion is just the form , @xmath37 where a simple estimate for the neutrino opacity @xmath38 is used , @xmath39 @xmath40 g@xmath13 based upon the cross section for neutrino nuclear absorption and scattering .",
    "characteristic convective velocities @xmath41 were deduced from simulations using our three - dimensional binary neutron star code @xcite .",
    "we calculated an angle averaged radial component of the fluid velocity in the frame of the star , @xmath42 for our studies , these velocities were fit with an ansatz of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radial position inside a star of radius @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the volume averaged @xmath41 .",
    "this gives a good fit to the numerical results and has the correct form in that the velocity goes to zero at the surface and also at @xmath47 .",
    "energy was deposited in accordance with equation [ jay : e : energydot ] and the calculations terminated at time=0 . in figure [ efig ]",
    "the fraction of energy released , the peak luminosity , and @xmath48 the average luminosity weighted by @xmath49 ( see next section ) are shown .",
    "the energy input was @xmath50 ergs and the orbital frequency was 4000 rad sec@xmath13 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the average convective velocity was found to be @xmath51 by analyzing the hydrodynamical calculations @xcite of neutron star binaries . from figure [ efig ]",
    "we see that a high emission efficiency and luminosity are obtained from this convective velocity .",
    "these produced lower thermal energies but about the same fraction of the energy emitted , @xmath52 , but the @xmath53 is reduced .",
    "for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 ergs @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 ergs sec@xmath13 . from these calculations",
    "we estimate that the conversion of compressional energy to fireball energy is probably @xmath60 .",
    "in the previous section we have outlined a mechanism by which neutrino luminosities of @xmath61 erg sec@xmath13 may arise from binary neutron stars approaching their final orbits . here",
    "we argue that the efficiency for converting these neutrinos into pair plasma is probably quite high .",
    "neutrinos emerging from the stars will deposit energy outside the stars predominantly by @xmath62 annihilation to form electron pairs .",
    "a secondary mechanism for energy deposition is the scattering of neutrinos from the @xmath10 pairs .",
    "strong gravitational fields near the stars will bend the neutrino trajectories .",
    "this greatly enhances the annihilation and scattering rates @xcite .",
    "figure [ plotq ] taken from @xcite shows the relativistic enhancement factor , @xmath63 , of the rate of annihilation by gravitational bending versus the radius to mass ratio ( in units @xmath64 ) . for our employed neutron - star equations of state",
    "the radius to mass ratio is typically between @xmath65 and 4 just before stellar collapse .",
    "thus , the enhancement factor ranges from @xmath5 8 to 28 . defining the efficiency of energy deposition as the ratio of energy deposition to neutrino luminosity ,",
    "then from equation 24 of @xcite we obtain , @xmath66 thus , the efficiency of annihilation ranges from @xmath670.1 to @xmath68 . for the upper range of luminosity",
    "the efficiency is quite large .    to better analyze the annihilation process we have adapted the mayle - wilson @xcite supernova model to this problem .",
    "we emphasize that the mayle - wilson model is fully general relativistic . to investigate this problem ,",
    "a hot neutron star of the appropriate @xmath69 was constructed and the internal temperature adjusted to achieve the correct neutrino luminosities .",
    "the courant condition requires that the time steps be quite small ( @xmath70 second ) , and zonal masses as low as @xmath71 are required just outside of the neutrinosphere .",
    "hence , the calculations could only be evolved for a short time .",
    "the entropy per baryon @xmath72 of the @xmath10 pair plasma is the critical quantity for gamma - ray production .",
    "it can be written , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the baryon density and @xmath75 is the total energy density .",
    "the entropy per baryon was found to be in the range of @xmath76 for the high luminosities .",
    "for a luminosity of @xmath11 ergs sec@xmath13 , an efficiency of energy transfer from the neutrinos to the @xmath10 pair plasma due to annihilation and electron scattering was found to be about 50 % .",
    "this efficiency of neutrino annihilation determines the total energy of the pair plasma and the entropy .",
    "this provides the initial conditions for the subsequent fireball expansion .",
    "having determined the initial conditions of the hot @xmath10 pair plasma near the surface of a neutron star , we wish to follow its evolution and characterize the observable gamma - ray emission . to study this",
    "we have developed a spherically symmetric , general relativistic hydrodynamic computer code to track the flow of baryons , @xmath10 pairs , and photons .",
    "for the present discussion we consider the plasma deposited at the surface of a @xmath77 neutron star with a radius of 10 km .",
    "the fluid is modeled by evolving the following spherically symmetric general relativistic hydrodynamic equations :    @xmath78    @xmath79   + \\dot e_{in } \\label{jay : e : ediff}\\ ] ]    @xmath80   \\label{jay : e : sdiff } % \\biggl [ \\frac { 1 - \\frac{2 m } { r } + 2 ( u^r)^2 } { \\alpha^4 } \\biggr]\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the lorentz contracted coordinate densities of baryonic and thermal mass energy ( @xmath10 and photons ) respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath83 and @xmath84 refer to the injected plasma from neutrino pair annihilation , and @xmath85 is the radial coordinate momentum density .",
    "@xmath86 is the radial component of the covariant 4-velocity .",
    "@xmath87 is the generalized lorentz factor , @xmath88 is the radial coordinate three velocity , and @xmath15 is an equation of state index .",
    "these quantities are defined by @xmath89 to evolve the @xmath10 pair plasma , we define a pair equation . the observed pair annihilation rate must be corrected for relativistic effects ; specifically , time dilation slows the apparent pair annihilation process for a fast moving fluid with respect to an observer .",
    "thus , we construct a continuity equation analogous to equation ( [ jay : e : ddiff ] ) and add a term to account for annihilation and pair - production reactions : @xmath90 here , @xmath91 is the coordinate pair number density , and @xmath92 is the maxwellian averaged mean pair annihilation rate per particle .",
    "although @xmath92 depends on @xmath93 , it varies little in the temperature range of interest , and thus , can be taken as constant : @xmath94 @xmath95 sec@xmath13 .",
    "@xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the local proper equilibrium @xmath10 pair density at temperature t given by the appropriate fermi integral with a chemical potential of zero .",
    "zero chemical potential is a good approximation when @xmath98 of equation ( [ jay : e : ndiff ] ) is important .",
    "the total proper energy equation , including photons and @xmath10 pairs ( baryon thermal energy is negligible ) , is @xmath99 where coordinate energy in equation ( [ jay : e : ediff ] ) is related to proper energy by @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the appropriate zero chemical potential fermi integral normalized to give the proper @xmath10 pair density @xmath102 as determined by equation ( [ jay : e : ndiff ] ) .",
    "the entropy per baryon ( equation [ entropyperbaryon ] ) of the wind is crucial to the behavior of the burst .",
    "an entropy that is too high will create a burst which is much hotter than those observed , while an entropy that is too low will extinguish the burst with baryons .",
    "we find that entropies of the order @xmath103 to @xmath104 are ideal for producing an isotropic burst directly from the expanding pair - photon plasma . in the calculations shown below ( sections [ analysespecltcrv ] & [ resultspplsma ] )",
    "we cover a range of possible entropies per baryon from @xmath105 to @xmath104 .",
    "other possible sources of high entropy - per - baryon plasmas include the formation of magnetized black holes @xcite and the high - energy collisions ( @xmath106 ) of stars in collapsing globular clusters , which we are studying in a separate work .",
    "we will deal with two paradigms for @xmath107ray production .",
    "first , we treat the high entropy case ( @xmath108 ) where the emission is from the fireball .",
    "secondly , we present a low entropy case in which gamma emission arises from the collision of the fireball with the local interstellar medium .    in the first case ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are evolved as the plasma expands .",
    "once the system becomes transparent to thomson scattering , ( @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the thomson cross - section ) we assume the photons are free - streaming , the calculation is stopped and the photon gas is analyzed to determine the photon signal .",
    "we find that the photons and @xmath10 pairs appear to decouple at virtually the same time throughout the entire photon-@xmath10 pair plasma ( when the cloud has reached a radius @xmath111 cm and the temperature is typically a few 10 s of ev ) .",
    "as such , the photons will be well approximated as thermal and so we neglect any radiation transport effects .",
    "thus , we take decoupling to be instantaneous and to occur when the plasma becomes optically thin to thomson scattering .",
    "furthermore , we find that virtually none of the energy deposited in the @xmath10 pair plasma remains in the pairs ( @xmath112% ) .",
    "thus , the conversion of @xmath10 pair energy to photons and baryons is very efficient . from this simulation",
    "we derive two observables , the time integrated energy spectrum @xmath113 and the total energy received as a function of observer time @xmath114 .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that the @xmath10 pairs and photons are equilibrated to the same @xmath93 when they decouple .",
    "thus , the photons in the fluid frame ( denoted with a prime : @xmath115 ) make up a planck distribution of the form @xmath116 but @xmath117 is a relativistic invariant @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath118 is also a relativistic invariant .",
    "so a planck distribution in an emitter s rest - frame with temperature @xmath119 will appear planckian to a moving observer , but with boosted temperature @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the component of fluid velocity ( c=1 ) directed toward the observer .",
    "thus , @xmath122 gives the observed spectrum of a blackbody with rest - frame temperature @xmath119 moving at velocity @xmath123 and angle @xmath124 with respect to the observer .    in the present case",
    "we wish to calculate the spectrum from a spherical , relativistically expanding shell as seen by a distant observer . since we know @xmath123 , @xmath119 and the radius @xmath45 of the shell , we integrate over volume ( i.e. , shell , angle ) with respect to the observer .",
    "we thus obtain the observed photon energy spectrum @xmath125 , from a relativistically expanding spherical shell with radius @xmath45 , thickness @xmath126 , velocity @xmath123 , lorentz factor @xmath2 and fluid - frame temperature @xmath119 , to be ( in photons / ev / steradian ) @xmath127 } { 1 - exp [ - \\gamma \\epsilon ( 1 - v)/t ' ] } \\biggr]~~({\\rm ev^{-1 } } sr^{-1}),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is in cm .",
    "note , that this spectrum has a maximum at @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "we may then sum this spectrum over all shells ( the zones in our computer code ) of the fireball to get the total spectrum .",
    "figure [ fireballspec ] shows an example of such a spectrum up to 500 kev .",
    "since we assume _ a priori _ that the photons are thermal , our spectrum has a high frequency exponential tail , but the resultant total spectrum is clearly not thermal in the high energies .      to construct the observed light curve @xmath114 we again decompose the spherical plasma into concentric shells and consider two effects : first , is the relative arrival time of the first light from each shell : light from outer shells will be observed before light from inner shells ; second , is the shape of the light curve from a single shell .",
    "emission from moving pair plasma is beamed along the direction of travel within an angle @xmath130 .",
    "the surface of simultaneity of a relativistically expanding spherical shell , as seen by an observer , is an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "the observer time of intersection of an expanding ellipse with a fixed shell of radius r as a function of @xmath124 ( i.e. the time at which emission from this intersection circle is received ) is : @xmath131 for @xmath132 . integrating our boosted planck distribution of photons ( equation [ jay : e : planck ] ) over frequency , we find that a relativistically expanding shell of radius r will have a time profile ( energy / time / steradian ) @xmath133 for @xmath134 and where @xmath135 .",
    "emission starts at @xmath136 and ends at @xmath137 .",
    "the final light curve is constructed by summing the signal from all shells .",
    "the total thickness of the expanding plasma is @xmath138 because it expands at near the speed of light and @xmath139 is the timescale of compression and coalescence which sets the emission timescale .",
    "typically @xmath140 cm and @xmath141 a few seconds , so @xmath142 and the emitting plasma is a thin shell .",
    "the duration of the burst is determined by the duration of emission because the observed timescale of emission from the plasma shell is very short , @xmath143 seconds ( equation [ ltcurvetimescale ] ) for @xmath144 , compared to @xmath139 .",
    "we have run a variety of models over a range of entropies per baryon and total energies .",
    "the results are summarized in figures [ date52 ] , [ date53 ] & [ dats7 ] .",
    "we see that more powerful bursts are derived from higher entropies per baryon and higher total energies .",
    "in particular , entropies per baryon of a few @xmath145 allow a burst with a spectral peak @xmath146 kev and efficiencies @xmath147% .",
    "this is consistent with , although at the upper end of the range of , the entropies calculated for the @xmath10 plasma deposited above the neutron stars .",
    "much further work needs to be done to better characterize the nature of the stellar compression and energy transport within the stars .",
    "also , more elaborate simulations must be done to resolve the plasma flow in three dimensions and to consider the effects of magnetic fields . in table",
    "[ gammatable ] we see the final lorentz factor for a range of expanding fireballs .",
    "this data will be used when we look at the collision of the fireball into an external medium .",
    "in previous sections the emission from an expanding fireball was studied .",
    "we found that the resulting emission spectrum and total energy strongly depends upon the energy of the plasma deposited near the surface of the neutron stars ; entropies of @xmath148 resulted in weak emission with most of the original energy manifesting itself as kinetic energy of the baryons .",
    "thus , for the low entropy per baryon fireballs ( @xmath149 ) produced by nsbs it is necessary to examine the emission due to the interaction of the relativistically expanding baryon wind with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .    after becoming optically thin and decoupling with the photons , the matter component of",
    "the fireball continues to expand and interact with the ism via collisionless shocks .",
    "as the ism is swept up , the matter decelerates .",
    "we model this process as an inelastic collision between the expanding fireball and the ism as in , for example , @xcite .",

    "now we wish to model the spectrum of light emitted as the fireball expands into the ism . to do this we assume an external synchrotron shock model @xcite .",
    "this analysis is analogous to afterglow models in the radiative limit .",
    "thus , the spectrum will have the form @xcite @xmath176 photon frequency @xmath177 is the frequency corresponding to the minimum energy of the electron distribution above which the electrons are assumed to have a power law functional form @xmath178 . in the numerical examples that follow ,",
    "we take the spectral index to be @xmath179 .",
    "this is consistent with that calculated for ultrarelativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "the `` cooling frequency '' @xmath180 corresponds to the energy below which the electrons can not cool on a hydrodynamic timescale .",
    "the peak of the luminosity spectrum is @xmath181 assuming @xmath182 , which is valid throughout the burst duration .",
    "there are two free parameters in this model .",
    "@xmath183 is the fraction of the kinetic energy of the baryons that is deposited into the electrons by the shock .",
    "@xmath184 is the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the kinetic energy density of the baryons . in these simulations",
    "we take each of these values to be @xmath185 .",
    "the evolution of the characteristic frequency @xmath177 is described by @xmath186    the behavior of the cooling frequency @xmath180 is more difficult to characterize since it depends on the hydrodynamical timescale of the fluid .",
    "fortunately , however , @xmath180 is much smaller than @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , its exact behavior is not important for this analysis .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath180 to be constant at early times and follow its asymptotic power - law at later times : @xmath187 the spectrum of the burst at peak luminosity @xmath169 is shown in figure [ xspec ] .",
    "for @xmath175 baryons @xmath21 , most of the energy is emitted at photon energies @xmath146 kev . using equations ( [ lequation],[numequation],[nucequation ] ) for @xmath188 , @xmath177 and @xmath180 respectively",

    "this is shown in figure [ xfluence ] .",
    "this figure again shows that most of the burst energy is in photons of several hundred kev energy .",
    "now we can ask what the efficiency is of gamma - ray production by the shock compared to other wavelengths . at any time , the fraction of luminosity above a given minimum frequency @xmath189 is    @xmath190}{\\bigl [ \\bigl(\\frac{2 p - 2}{p-2 } \\bigr )                  \\nu_m^{-1/2 } - \\frac{5}{4 } \\nu_c^{1/2 } \\bigr ] } &                  \\nu_c < \\nu_{min } < \\nu_m\\\\ \\\\",

    "\\nu_c ~.          \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    thus , we can calculate the duration , @xmath191 , of the luminosity at energies above this minimum energy .",
    "this is done in table [ t90table ] for the various fireballs shown in table [ gammatable ] .",
    "there is a competition between factors limiting the duration ; lower energy fireballs simply have fewer high energy photons , and thus , shorter duration ; while higher energy fireballs expand and evolve faster and thus have shorter duration . fireballs with energy of order @xmath14 ergs and entropies per baryon of order @xmath192 yield a value for @xmath191 which is consistent with observation .",
    "the overall efficiency of the production of photons above a frequency @xmath189 is @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the value of @xmath177 ( equation [ numequation ] ) at @xmath195 . for @xmath196 kev",
    "we have an overall efficiency of about @xmath197 % .",
    "thus , the radiative external shock grb is quite efficient at producing gamma - rays if our assumptions are reasonable .",
    "in this paper we have argued that heated neutron stars ( perhaps by compression of close neutron - star binaries ) are viable candidates for the production of large , high entropy per baryon , @xmath10 pair plasma fireballs , and thus , for the creation of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we find that fireballs of total energy @xmath198 to @xmath199 ergs and an entropy per baryon of @xmath200 are possible .",
    "values for the entropy as high as @xmath103 may be realized during the peak @xmath201 luminosity ( of @xmath202 ergs sec@xmath13 ) .",
    "emergent gamma - rays yield a quasi - thermal spectrum peaked at @xmath146 kev with an efficiency of conversion from pair plasma to photons of @xmath203%",
    ". the lower entropy component of the fireball will initiate a shock which propagates into the ism , generating an external shock grb .",
    "the calculation utilizing the supernova computer program ( section [ neutrinoannihilation ] ) to describe the neutrino and matter transport , produces a baryonic wind that contains @xmath204% neutrons .",
    "the decay of the neutrons to protons occurs on the same time scale as that for which the protons are decelerated by the intersteller medium .",
    "this delayed conversion of neutrons to protons will broaden the gamma - ray signal by a factor of a few .",
    "in addition , the decay electrons will strongly increase the entropy of the expanding plasma at the late times . in future work",
    "we will quantify the role of neutrons and explore the possibility of fireball photons inverse - compton up - scattering off of the accelerated electron distribution of the external shock .",
    "this corresponds to the emission scenario put forward by @xcite .    as of",
    "yet this model is spherically symmetric .",
    "thus , it can only generate bursts with a smooth light - curve structure .",
    "however , we expect a large variety of grb morphologies with varied time structure due to : 1 ) three dimensional resolution of the plasma flow ; 2 ) plasma instabilities due to increased heating of the deposited plasma with time ; and 3 ) variation in the ratio of star mass in the nsb , effecting the relative compression and heating rate of each star .    in future work we will numerically model , in three dimensions , the flow of the @xmath10 pair plasma in the midst of the orbiting neutron stars .",
    "we have written a three - dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic code to study this three - dimensional behavior .",
    "in particular , we wish to study the possible formation of jets along the orbital axis due to the collision of plasma blowing away from each star .",
    "also , we have done simulations which suggest that the internal magnetic field of the neutron stars may be high .",
    "thus , the inclusion of magnetohydrodynamic plasma effects including alfvn instabilities and reconnections may ultimately be necessary .",

    "a key requirement of a gamma - ray burst paradigm based upon collapsing neutron stars in binaries is that the equation of state be relatively soft so that significant compression and heating can occur before inspiral .",
    "therefore , for completeness in this appendix we review arguments for and against a `` soft '' neutron star eos .",
    "the neutron star eos must extend from normal iron nuclei on the surface to as much as 15 times nuclear matter density in the interior . at the same time",
    ", one must consider that neutron stars in weak - interaction equilibrium are highly isospin asymmetric .",
    "they may also carry net strangeness .",
    "therefore , only pieces of the neutron - star equation of state , e.g. the nuclear compressibility , are accessible in laboratory experiments .",
    "the value for the nuclear compressibility @xmath205 can be derived from the nuclear monopole resonance @xcite .",
    "the present value ( @xmath206 230 mev ) is consistent with a modestly soft nuclear equation of state .",
    "nuclear heavy - ion collision data can also be used to shed some insight , particularly for the heated neutron - star equation of state .",
    "for example , @xcite studied heavy ion collisions of @xmath207la on @xmath207la as a means to constrain the supernova eos .",
    "the electron fraction for @xmath208la ( @xmath209 ) overlaps that of supernovae which range from @xmath210 to 0.50 .",
    "they showed that the pion contribution to the eos could be constrained by the observed pion multiplicities from central collisions .",
    "the formation and evolution of pions was computed in the context of landau - migdal theory to model the effective energy and momenta of the pions .",
    "a key aspect of hydrodynamic simulations of the heavy - ion data was the determination of the landau parameter @xmath211 .",
    "their determination of the pion contribution to the equation of state implies a relatively soft equation of state after pion condensation such that a maximum neutron - star mass of @xmath212 m@xmath19 is inferred .",
    "there have been dozens of nuclear equations of state introduced over the years .",
    "summaries of some of them can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as far as the maximum mass of a neutron star is concerned , most theoretical equations of state fall into two groups , those which only describe the mean nuclear field even at high density and those which allow for various condensates , e.g. pions , kaons , hyperons , and even quark - gluon plasma .",
    "table [ tableos ] summarizes the basic neutron star properties based upon most available nuclear equations of state @xcite .",
    "equations of state which are based upon the mean nuclear field tend to be `` stiff '' at high density .",
    "therefore , they reach lower interior densities for the same baryonic mass and tend to allow a higher maximum neutron - star mass @xmath213 m@xmath19",
    ". such equations of state also tend to become acausal at the high densities associated with the maximum neutron - star mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the relativistic equations of state are generally causal at high density .",
    "they also tend to be somewhat `` soft '' , therefore allowing a higher central density for a given baryon mass and generally implying a maximum neutron - star mass in the range @xmath214 m@xmath19 .",
    "we note , however , that recent 3-body corrections to a relativistic eos @xcite tend to stiffen an otherwise soft relativistic eos .",
    "for the most part , constraints on the neutron star equation of state must ultimately come from observations of neutron stars themselves . over the years attempts",
    "have been made with limited success to constrain the equation of state based upon the maximum observed rotation frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or the thermal response to neutron star glitches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , however , new observational constraints on the structure and properties of neutron stars are becoming available @xcite . observations of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) @xcite , pulsar light curves @xcite , and glitches @xcite , studies of soft - gamma repeaters @xcite ; and even the identification of an isolated non - pulsing neutron stars @xcite have all led to the hope that significant constraints on the mass - radius relation and maximum mass of neutron stars may be soon coming .",
    "two possible constraints come from measured pulsar systems .",
    "the most precisely measured property of any pulsar system is its spin frequency .",
    "the frequencies of the fastest pulsars ( psr b1937 + 21 at 641.9 hz and b1957 + 20 at 622.1 hz ) already constrain the equation of state under the assumption that these pulsars are near their maximum spin frequency @xcite . in particular",
    ", the equation of state can not be too stiff , though maximum masses as large as 3 m@xmath19 are still allowed .",
    "a much more stringent constraint may come from the numerous determinations of neutron - star masses in pulsar binaries .",
    "there are now about 50 known pulsars in binary systems . of these 50 , approximately 15 of them",
    "have significantly constrained masses .",
    "these are summarized in table [ tablnsmass ] .",
    "the measured masses are all consistent with low neutron - star masses in the range @xmath215 m@xmath19 @xcite . even though these masses are low",
    ", this does not necessarily mean that the maximum neutron - star mass is in this range .",
    "if one adopts these masses as approaching the maximum neutron - star mass , then the softer equations of state are preferred",
    ". however , this narrow mass range may be the result of the mechanism of neutron - star formation in supernovae and not an indication of the maximum neutron - star mass .    in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite have proposed that glitches observed in the vela pulsar and six other pulsars may place some constraint on the nuclear eos .",
    "in particular , if the glitches originate from the liquid of the inner crust , and if the mass of the vela pulsar is 1.35 consistent with table 2 , then the radius of the vela pulsar must be @xmath216 km .",
    "this result is consistent with either a soft or stiff equations of state .",
    "a better theoretical determination of the pressure at the crust - core interface might lead to a more stringent constraint .",
    "the identification of kilohertz qpo s with the last stable orbit around a neutron star also could significantly constrain the neutron - star equation of state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , demanding that the 1.2 khz qpo from source ks 1731 - 260 be the last stable orbit requires a neutron - star mass of 1.8 m@xmath19 , on the other hand , other interpretations are possible for the origin of qpo s .",
    "for example , they could be a harmonic of a lower frequency outer orbit , or they might result from effects closer to the neutron - star surface . among proposals for the source of the qpo phenomenon",
    "are : boundary layer oscillations @xcite ; radial oscillations and diffusive propagation in the transition region between the neutron star and the last keplerian orbit @xcite ; lense - thirring precession for fluid particles near the last stable orbit @xcite ; and nonequitorial resonant oscillations of magnetic fluid blobs @xcite .",
    "the lack of a radio pulsar in sn1987a , along with nucleosynthesis constraints on the observed change of helium abundance with metallicity has led to the suggestion @xcite that the maximum neutron - star mass must be @xmath217 m@xmath19 . in this picture",
    ", the development of a kaon condensate tends to greatly soften the eos after @xmath218 sec .",
    "thus , even though neutrinos were emitted , the core subsequently collapses to a black hole .",
    "one constraint comes from the neutrino signal itself observed to arise from supernova sn1987a .",
    "the fact that the neutrinos arrived over an interval of at least twelve seconds implies a significant cooling and neutrino diffusion time from the core .",
    "this favors a soft equation of state in which the core is more compact and at higher temperature in the supernova models .",
    "for example , the simulations of @xcite require a maximum neutron - star mass of @xmath219 m@xmath19 .",
    "a most promising constraint on the neutron - star eos may come from the determination of the radius for the isolated nonpulsing neutron star rx j185635 - 3754 , first detected by rosat @xcite .",
    "the inferred ( redshifted ) surface temperature from the x - ray emission is about 35 ev .",
    "atmospheric models of this emission then imply @xcite that for a distance between 31 and 41 pc , a radius between @xmath220 and a mass of @xmath221 , is most consistent with the observed emission .",
    "this is suggestive of a soft equation of state .",
    "however , this constraint requires that the distance be less than 41 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite find that the cooling properties of the soft x - ray source rx j0720.4 - 3125 are most consistent with a moderately stiff or stiff eos provided that the age of this star is less than 10@xmath222 yr .",
