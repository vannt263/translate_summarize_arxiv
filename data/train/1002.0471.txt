    "understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies , in particular the most massive , is one of the major challenges in modern astrophysics .",
    "many massive galaxies today are giant early - type systems ; hence the formation of spheroids should proceed to a certain extent in locked step with the mass assembly .",
    "the compelling theory of hierarchical galaxy formation predicts that galaxies are assembled through successive mergers of smaller systems in overdensities , or haloes , of hypothetical cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "massive galaxies therefore emerge in the last phase of the formation history .",
    "alternatively , massive galaxies could form through the rapid collapse of gas followed by a single prominent starburst at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "this monolithic scenario is supported by , for example , the tight colour  luminosity relation of early - type galaxies found in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while different evolution in different models makes distant massive galaxies a unique test - bed for galaxy formation scenarios , observations have not yet provided evidence for the evolutionary path of those galaxies .",
    "the major obstacle in observations originates from the scarcity of galaxies at the high end of the galaxy mass function ; it means that not only it is hard to find the population but also cosmic variance , the field - to - field variation of observed volume density arising from large - scale structure , is significant . in the last decade , many large programmes of optical - band imaging have been carried out , providing excellent data sets with which to investigate distant red old galaxies in wide fields of sky exceeding a whole deg@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they consistently suggest that the total stellar mass locked in red galaxies with luminosities around @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the characteristic luminosity of the luminosity function , has at least doubled since @xmath10 . some of them also claim little growth in the number of very luminous galaxies well above @xmath8 .",
    "however , while luminous red galaxies roughly correspond to massive galaxies , it is not clear how well the evolution in the number of galaxies at the steep high end of the mass function is understood from these results , since the much more numerous , less massive galaxies with mass - to - luminosity ratios slightly less than average could easily dominate the observed numbers of luminous galaxies .",
    "the above authors also reveal that a field of view of the order of a whole deg@xmath3 is still not sufficient to conquer the uncertainty arising from cosmic variance for the high - end populations of the galaxy mass function .",
    "the advent of the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrareddeep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides a unique opportunity to produce an ideal sample to trace various aspects of massive galaxies in the distant universe . here",
    "we report the results of a @xmath4-band survey with optical ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 band ) and near - infrared ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 band ) photometry and optical spectra , focusing on massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies out to @xmath2 in an unprecedented large area covering 55.2 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4-band photometry provides robust estimates of galaxy stellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the very large field of view significantly suppresses cosmic variance , which allow us to conduct a unique analysis of the mean properties of distant massive galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data sources and reduction process to extract the galaxy sample from the available data .",
    "photometric redshifts and stellar masses are measured for each galaxy in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "the number - density evolution of massive galaxies and the associated uncertainties are explored .",
    "we then discuss the star - forming properties of galaxies and the compatibility of the present results with previous measurements in section 5 .",
    "a summary follows in section 6 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology of @xmath19 = 70 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "magnitudes are expressed in the vega magnitude system for the ukidss near - infrared bands and in the ab magnitude system for the optical bands .",
    "we extract from the data release 3 ( dr3 ; warren et al .",
    ", in preparation ) of the ukidss / large area survey ( las ) the @xmath4-band sources with right ascensions from 1@xmath23 15@xmath24 to 3@xmath23 6@xmath24 on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) southern equatorial stripe ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "the range in right ascension is chosen so that the @xmath4-band observations are fairly complete within the sample area .",
    "more than half of the @xmath4-band sources have also been observed in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 bands .",
    "we exclude the sources assigned with serious quality flags corresponding to ` pperrbits ` attributes larger than 31 , or near ( within 20 arcsec of ) the detector edges of any exposure .",
    "we also exclude those sources near bright sources .",
    "this is achieved by searching for bright point and extended sources in the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) catalogues and rejecting all the las sources within sufficiently large distances of the bright 2mass sources .",
    "the total effective area of the observations defining our sample is 55.2 deg@xmath3 .",
    "we retrieved all the images in our sample area from the dr3 data base , and used the ` source extractor ` , version 2.5 @xcite for magnitude measurements .",
    "the total magnitudes ( @xmath25 ) of the sources are measured with the ` source extractor ` total magnitude algorithm ` mag_auto ` .",
    "we measure the aperture magnitudes ( @xmath26 ) with circular apertures of several diameters , 4.5 , 3.3 , 2.8 and 2.6 arcsec , which correspond to 20 kpc at @xmath15 = 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "since the seeing condition is generally superior in the ukidss las ( @xmath00.8 arcsec ) to that in the optical observations by the sdss ( @xmath01.5 arcsec ) , the near - infrared images were smoothed with the gaussian kernel in such a way that the resultant full widths at half - maximum ( fwhms ) of stellar profiles are similar to those in the optical images of the same field .",
    "the seeing measurements and smoothing were performed in each of the small rectangular subareas of approximately 9 @xmath27 13 arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "then we ran the ` source extractor ` on the smoothed images to measure the aperture magnitudes of the sources .",
    "the detection completeness of the @xmath4-band sources can be estimated by comparing the numbers of the las detections with those of the much deeper ukidss deep extragalactic survey ( dxs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in an overlapping field .",

    "@xmath2800@xmath29 24 on the celestial equator .",
    "while the field is outside the ra range of our las fields , we confirmed that the evaluation sample of this field has a similar distribution of magnitudes and their errors to those for our actual sample .",
    "below we show that the derived detection - completeness function reproduces the galaxy number counts from our sample , in excellent agreement with previous measurements , while it gives the lower limit of the detection completeness for our massive galaxies .",
    "we define our sample as being brighter than the limiting total magnitude @xmath30 = 17.9 mag , where the detection completeness is higher than 0.5 .",
    "we use the optical @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15-band images on the sdss southern equatorial stripe .",
    "the stripe has been observed repeatedly in the sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite during 2005 2007 , as well as in the original sdss .",
    "we retrieved all the available images taken on the stripe from the sdss data release 6 supplemental and supernova survey data bases @xcite , and stacked them in each of the five bands .",
    "the images observed in runs 2738 and 3325 are set apart from others , since they are taken with the standard survey conditions of the original sdss and can work as the reference frames for stellar photometry .",
    "we measure , for each retrieved image , the mean and root - mean - square ( rms ) of the sky counts and the sky transparency at the observation by comparing the stellar photometry of the relevant frame with that of the reference frames . after discarding the worst 5 per cent of the retrieved images with the largest rms of sky counts , which we find is sufficient to reject apparently flawed exposures , the images are zero - shifted and scaled according to the sky - count statistics and then stacked by the inverse - of - variance weighted average using ` iraf ` .",
    "the photometric calibration of the stacked images is achieved by comparing the stellar photometry with that of the reference frames .",
    "we find that the stellar magnitudes on the stacked and reference frames are in excellent agreement , with rms less than 0.05 mag ( fig .",

    "the groups with four or more pixels whose counts are 1.5@xmath32 above the local background level are identified as sources . for every detection , we measure the aperture magnitudes in the 4.5- , 3.3- , 2.8- and 2.6-arcsec diameter apertures as we did for the near - infrared images .",
    "the photometry errors are calculated from the source photon counts and the background noise .",
    "the extracted sources are cross - identified with the @xmath4-band sources within the maximum paring tolerance of 1.0 arcsec .",
    "owing to the deep stacking of the sdss images , nearly 90 per cent of the @xmath4-band sources have counterparts in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "nearly 40 per cent of the @xmath4-band sources also have counterparts in the @xmath11 band .",
    "we exploit the two redshift surveys carried out on the sdss southern equatorial stripe ; the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the deep2 redshift survey @xcite . among the four fields of the vvds wide survey ,",

    "the vvds adopts a pure @xmath34-band flux - limited selection of the sample while the deep2 imposes strict colour pre - selection on the spectroscopic targets to favour galaxies at @xmath35 ; thus the two surveys are complementary in terms of the sample selection .",
    "we use only the spectroscopic sample with high redshift - quality flags , ` zflag`/`zq ` = 3 or 4 for the vvds / deep2 . as a result",

    "we obtain 259 082 galaxies with these classification criteria .",

    "first , the dxs @xmath4vvds galaxies are classified into five spectral types , ell , sbc , scd , irr and starburst ( sb ) by least-@xmath41 fitting with the appropriate amounts of dust extinction assuming the extinction laws of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by @xcite for scd and irr and that of starburst galaxies by @xcite for sb .",

    "there are a number of studies of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at @xmath51 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) covering up to @xmath010 deg@xmath3 .",
    "authors consistently suggest that the lrgs show little evolution in number density since @xmath10 .",
    "however , the mass - to - optical luminosity ratio of galaxies has a significant scatter even for the massive systems , so that galaxies with a certain stellar mass are not quite the equivalent population of galaxies with a certain optical luminosity .",
    "this leads to a consequence of most significance for the most massive galaxies : a small portion of the less massive , much more numerous galaxies could contaminate the luminous class of galaxies if their mass - to - luminosity ratios were slightly less than the average , and thus could easily dominate the luminous population .",
    "therefore a subtle ( in absolute amplitude ) change in the number of most massive galaxies could be drowned out in the measured evolution of the lrgs .",
    "studies also exist of massive galaxies at @xmath51 with stellar mass measurements based on infrared photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although these studies cover a much smaller field of view ( @xmath52 1.5 deg@xmath3 ) than ours .",
    "in contrast to the present results , they report little evolution in number of the most massive ( @xmath53 ) galaxies",
    ". at least part of the discrepancy could be due to small - number statistics and cosmic variance .",
    "actually , while we find @xmath01000 samples of the most massive galaxies in each redshift bin from our 55.2 deg@xmath3 , the number of samples observed over @xmath01.5 deg@xmath3 should be only @xmath030 .",
    "we estimate the effects of cosmic variance by dividing our total field into small subfields , each covering @xmath0 1.5 deg@xmath3 , and measure the number - density fluctuations of massive galaxies among the subfields . as a result",
    ", we find that the number densities of the most massive galaxies measured over @xmath0 1.5 deg@xmath3 can fluctuate by up to a factor of a few .",
    "however , we are not sure whether the above uncertainties alone can account for the discrepancy between the present results and previous ones . the number - density measurements at the steep high end of the galaxy stellar mass function could be heavily affected by contamination arising from less massive galaxies , thus quite accurate analysis is required to unveil the subtle evolution of the most massive galaxies .",
    "in essence , our measurements provide a unique opportunity to investigate the mean properties and evolution of the most massive galaxies , owing to the reliable estimates of photometric redshifts and stellar masses conducted over an unprecedentedly large field of view .",
    "what is observationally clear is that we have discovered a substantial deficit of the most massive galaxies out to @xmath2 compared with the local universe .",
    "the analysis of the rest - frame @xmath54 colour distributions indicates that star - formation activity might be responsible for the active build - up of these systems , while it is possible that a so - called dry merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the main driver of the evolution .",
    "actually , some observations suggest that a substantial fraction of massive early - type galaxies go through active evolution in terms of the galaxy structure as well as the star formation since @xmath55 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the present results provide crucial evidence of hierarchical galaxy formation , the missing piece of observation required to chart a course for future theoretical models based on @xmath6cdm theory .",
    "we present an analysis of @xmath060 000 massive galaxies with stellar masses @xmath56 in an unprecedentedly large field of view of 55.2 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the galaxies are drawn from the ukidss large area survey k - band images on the sdss southern equatorial stripe .",
    "we have created deep - stacked @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15-band images from the sdss supplemental and supernova survey image frames , which results in @xmath090 per cent counterparts of the @xmath4-band sources in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "we also exploit the redshift surveys conducted on the sdss southern equatorial stripe , namely the vimos - vlt deep survey and the deep2 redshift survey , in order to obtain accurate photometric redshifts and associated uncertainties for the galaxies .",
    "stellar masses are estimated by comparing the observed broad - band colours with stellar population synthesis models .    in each of the redshift bins @xmath15 = 0.20.4 , 0.40.6 , 0.60.8 and 0.81.0 , we obtain @xmath010 000 and @xmath01 000 galaxies with stellar masses @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . the galaxies are almost completely detected out to @xmath2 , and form by far the largest sample of massive galaxies reaching to the universe at about half its present age .",
    "we find that the most massive ( @xmath58 ) galaxies have experienced rapid growth in number since @xmath2 , while the number densities of less massive systems show rather mild evolution .",
    "such a hierarchical trend of evolution is consistent with the predictions of the current semi - analytic galaxy formation model based on @xmath6cdm theory .",
    "while the majority of the massive galaxies are red - sequence populations , we find that a considerable fraction are blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "the blue fraction is less in more massive systems and decreases toward the local universe , leaving the red , most massive galaxies at low redshifts , which further supports the idea of active bottom - up formation of these populations during @xmath59 .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of @xmath060 000 massive ( stellar mass @xmath1 ) galaxies out to @xmath2 drawn from 55.2 deg@xmath3 of the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ii supernova survey . </S>",
    "<S> this is by far the largest survey of massive galaxies with robust mass estimates , based on infrared ( @xmath4-band ) photometry , reaching to the universe at about half its present age . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the most massive ( @xmath5 ) galaxies have experienced rapid growth in number since @xmath2 , while the number densities of the less massive systems show rather mild evolution . </S>",
    "<S> such a hierarchical trend of evolution is consistent with the predictions of the current semi - analytic galaxy formation model based on @xmath6cdm theory . </S>",
    "<S> while the majority of massive galaxies are red - sequence populations , we find that a considerable fraction of galaxies are blue star - forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the blue fraction is smaller in more massive systems and decreases toward the local universe , leaving the red , most massive galaxies at low redshifts , which would support the idea of active bottom - up formation of these populations during @xmath7 .    </S>",
