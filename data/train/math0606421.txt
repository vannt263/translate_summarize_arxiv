    "however , the unbounded interval can be bijectively mapped onto a bounded interval using an operator monotone fractional mbius transformation with operator monotone inverse , and then any polynomial in the gap over that bounded interval , after proper composition with those fractional mbius transformations , yields a rational function from the gap over the unbounded interval .    in this paper",
