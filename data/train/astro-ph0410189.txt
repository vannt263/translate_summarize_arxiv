    "before beginning a discussion of the _ fuse _  contributions to the study of he  ii reionization , i provide an overview of the cosmological significance of  reionization \" .",
    "this term refers to the sudden increase in ionization fraction of hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , initiated at redshifts @xmath8 by the first sources of ionizing radiation . after the epoch of recombination at @xmath9 , the igm entered a long period of  dark ages \" when the igm was mostly neutral .",
    "this period ended sometime before @xmath1 , perhaps as early as @xmath3 .",
    "the ionization state of the igm affects the transmission of radiation through the ly@xmath0 absorbers ( h  i and he  ii ) , as well as the electron - scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . as individual ionizing sources ( stars , galaxies , quasars ) began emitting ionizing radiation , regions of ionized gas were produced , preceded by ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) in the igm .",
    "these isolated ionized zones ( h  ii regions , he  iii regions ) eventually overlapped ( gnedin 2000 ) , after which the igm became transparent to ly@xmath0 radiation .",
    "residual absorption continued as a  picket fence \" of discrete , redshifted ly@xmath0 absorbers , often termed the  ly@xmath0 forest \"  see spectra in songaila ( 1998 ) .    the rapid increase in igm ionization occurred as a topological phase change in the volume filling factor of ionized zones .",
    "the longer the first ionizing sources were on , the greater the volume of the zones . in order to effectively absorb all the ly@xmath0 radiation at @xmath10",
    "requires a neutral fraction of just @xmath11 , even in gas that is underdense by a factor of 10 relative to the mean .",
    "simulations of this reionization process ( gnedin 2000 , 2004 ) show that the transition from neutral to ionized is quite extended in time , between @xmath12 .",
    "the first stage ( pre - overlap ) involves the development and expansion of the first isolated ionizing sources .",
    "the second stage marks the overlap of the i - fronts and the disappearance of the last vestiges of low - density neutral gas .",
    "finally , in the post - overlap stage , the remaining high - density gas is photoionized from the outside .",
    "the final drop in neutral fraction and increase in photon mean free path occur quite rapidly , over @xmath13 ( see fig .  1 of gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "reionization is tied closely to the onset of galaxy formation beginning at @xmath14 . for the ionization of he",
    "ii , and somewhat for h  i , reionization depends on the rise in the numbers and luminosities of active galactic nuclei from @xmath15 . according to numerical simulations ( e.g. , ricotti , gnedin , & shull 2002 , herafter denoted rgs ) ,",
    "the earliest epochs of galaxy formation began at @xmath16 triggered by h  i and h@xmath17 cooling of protogalactic halos with virial temperatures @xmath18  k to @xmath19  k. rgs found that the average star formation rate density , @xmath20 , increased monotonically from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xmath23 between @xmath24 and 10 , according to the approximate formula : @xmath25    the effects of reionization can be seen indirectly in the electron - scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "however , the most direct observations of the igm ionization state come from their influence on the ly@xmath0 line - blanketing opacity of the igm at wavelengths shortward of the h  i and he  ii ly@xmath0 lines at @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . as the amounts of h  i or he  ii increase , these line - blanketed regions grow into black (  gunn - peterson \" ) absorption troughs , whose presence can be used to identify high - redshift galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "the best probes of the epoch of reionization have come from analyzing the weak transmission of agn continuum flux in these troughs , as the high - redshift igm transforms from a neutral to ionized medium .",
    "the he  ii absorption becomes detectable in the far ultraviolet at redshifts @xmath4 with _ fuse _  and at @xmath28 with hst . from the latest ly@xmath0 data , the reionization epochs occur at @xmath29 for h  i ( becker et  al .  2001 ;",
    "fan et  al .  2002 ; gnedin 2004 ) and at @xmath30 for he  ii ( kriss et  al .  2001 ; smette et  al .",
    "2002 ; shull et  al .  2004 ; zheng et  al .  2004 ) .",
    "an indirect measure of reionization can be extracted from an analysis of fluctuations in the cmb radiation , particularly the large - angle temperature - polarization correlations . by combining the first - year data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) with other results on the cmb , ly@xmath0 forest , and galaxy large - scale structure , spergel et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a high value of the cmb optical depth to electron scattering , @xmath31 .",
    "this optical depth implies a surprisingly large redshift of early igm reionization , ranging from @xmath32 at 95% confidence ( kogut et al .",
    "more recent estimates of @xmath33 and other cosmological parameters ( tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ) combined the wmap data with the three - dimensional power spectrum from over 200,000 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "their analysis tightened many of the wmap error bars and gave somewhat lower @xmath34 .",
    "there is still disagreement between the redshift @xmath35 found from ( h  i ) ly@xmath0 opacity and the  early reionization \" estimates , @xmath36 10 - 20 , inferred from the cmb . the optical - depth estimates from wmap",
    "are consistent with a wide range in @xmath33 , reflecting the broad likelihood function ( see figure 4 of spergel et  al .",

    "the critical density is @xmath53  g  @xmath54 . for large redshifts , @xmath55 , and the integral simplifies to @xmath56 \\omega_m^{1/2 } ( 1+z_r)^{3/2 } \\approx ( 0.00229 ) ( 1+z_r)^{3/2 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] nearly independent of @xmath57 .",
    "additional contributions to @xmath33 arise from residual electrons ( @xmath58 ionized fraction ) frozen out after recombination ( seager , sasselov , & scott 2000 ) and from partial reionization prior to @xmath37 by the first stars ( venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) and early x - ray sources ( venkatesan , giroux , & shull 2001 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004 ) .",
    "these additional ionization sources could contribute extra electron scattering in the amount @xmath59 .",
    "we now invert the above relation to estimate the reionization redshift , @xmath60 here , we scaled to @xmath61 , equal to the wmap - measured value of optical depth , @xmath31 , reduced by @xmath62 arising from additional electron scattering prior to @xmath37 . a re - analysis of wmap data ( tegmark et  al .",

    "helium reionization is delayed by 1.4 gyr ( @xmath70 ) from hydrogen reionization , probably because he  ii is more difficult to ionize , requiring a harder ( 4 ryd continuum ) , probably from agn .",
    "it is also possible that partial he  ii reionization could occur at @xmath71 , from a population of ultra - hot , zero - metallicity massive stars ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ; venkatesan , tumlinson , & shull 2003 ) .    _",

    "the he  ii absorption is generally much stronger than h  i by a factor @xmath73n(he  ii)/n(h  i ) , predicted theoretically ( fgs ) to be 50100 for photoionization by quasar backgrounds . for optically thin lines ,",
    "we can write @xmath74 . the greater strength of he  ii arises because it is harder to photoionize than h  i , owing to lower fluxes and cross sections at its ionizing threshold ( @xmath75  ev ) and because he  iii recombines 5 times faster than h  ii .",
    "variations in @xmath6 can be used to diagnose the sources and fluctuations of the metagalactic ionizing spectrum in the continua of h  i ( 1  ryd ) and he  ii ( 4  ryd ) .",
    "he  ii absorption is also a good diagnostic of absorption from low - density regions (  voids \" ) in the igm . because @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , he  ii can be tracked into much lower density regions than h  i. he  ii absorption can also be used to probe collisionally ionized gas at @xmath78  k , produced by shock - heating during structure formation ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",

    "we focussed on two major topics : ( 1 ) small - scale variability ( @xmath7 ) in the ratio @xmath81 n(he  ii)/n(h  i ) ; and ( 2 ) an observed correlation of high-@xmath6 absorbers ( soft radiation fields ) with voids in the ( h  i ) ly@xmath0 distribution .",
    "these @xmath6 variations ( figure 3 ) probably reflect fluctuations in the ionizing sources on scales of 1 mpc , modified by radiative transfer through a filamentary igm whose opacity controls the penetration of 1 - 5 ryd radiation over 3040 mpc distances . in photoionization equilibrium ,",
    "the he  ii / h  i ratio can be expressed : @xmath82 here , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the case - a recombination rate coefficients and photoionization rates for h  i and he  ii , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the specific intensities of the radiation field at the h  i ( 912   ) and he  ii ( 228   ) edges . the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the local spectral indices of the ionizing background at 1 and 4 ryd , respectively , which provide minor corrections to the photoionization rates .",
    "we adopt case - a hydrogenic recombination rates to h  i and he  ii , appropriate for the ly@xmath0 forest absorbers with very low neutral fractions .",

    "these voids may be ionized by local soft sources ( dwarf starbursts ) or by qso radiation softened by escape from the agn cores or transfer through the  cosmic web \" .",
    "the apparent differences in ionizing spectra may help to explain the 1.4 gyr lag between the reionization epochs of h  i ( @xmath106 ; gnedin 2004 ) and he  ii ( @xmath107 ; kriss et  al .",
    "2001 ; shull et  al .",

    "figure 5 shows some of the actual agn spectra on which these conclusions are based .",
    "it is apparent that even low - redshift qsos and seyferts have wide differences in their euv continuum slopes , which may be luminosity dependent ( scott et  al .",
    "in addition to intrinsic source variations , the metagalactic radiation field is heavily filtered and reprocessed by intervening igm ( see fgs ) . because the he  ii opacity is so strong ( @xmath77 ) , fluctuations at 4 ryd are probably larger than those at 1 ryd .",
    "unfortunately , we must conclude that the sources , spectra , and fine - grained spatial variations in the metagalactic ionizing radiation field are still not well understood .",
    "future studies of he  ii should proceed along several fronts . first and foremost , we need to find additional high - redshift agn targets for which we can repeat the he  ii / h  i measurements and @xmath6 analysis .",
    "quasar h1700 + 6416 at @xmath108 is one such _",

    "radiation in the 3 - 4 ryd band may be especially important for the photoionization corrections to c  iii , c  iv , si  iii , and si  iv on which igm metallicities are based .",
    "finally , it would be helpful to characterize the mean intrinsic euv spectra of agn , at @xmath109 , which are still highly uncertain ( figure 5 ) despite heroic efforts with both hst and _ fuse_. there is currently only a small wavelength window at which the rest - frame euv is observable , and it does not extend to @xmath110  , the 4 ryd continuum that controls he  ii ionization ."
