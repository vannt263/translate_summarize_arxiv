    "in contrast , _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the helix detected only a point source associated with the central star , but the x - ray properties of this source are mysterious .",
    "the central star of the helix nebula , wd 2226@xmath2210 , is a @xmath1110,000  k hot white dwarf @xcite .",

    "the luminosity , temporal variations , and spectral properties of this hard x - ray component @xcite and the variability of wd 2226@xmath2210 s h@xmath3 emission line profile @xcite are consistent with the coronal activity of an m dwarf . however , a sensitive _ hst _ search has ruled out the presence of any companion with a spectral type earlier than m5 @xcite .",
    "the mystery regarding the central star of the helix nebula deepens with new _",
    "observations at 24 and 70  @xmath0 , as reported in this paper .",
    "the helix nebula was observed with all three _ spitzer _ instruments : the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mips observations were made in the scan map mode with a medium scan rate and a half - array offset , resulting in an effective integration of 80 s per pointing and covering an area of 05 @xmath4 08 in each of the 24 , 70 , and 160  @xmath0  bands .",
    "three mips scan maps were taken in sequence with @xmath510 hr separations to avoid confusion by asteroids .",
    "the irs high - resolution observations of the central star and a nearby nebular position were made in sequence in the staring mode .",
    "the irac observations have been described in detail by @xcite .",
    "basic reduction for the mips data was carried out using the mips data analysis tool @xcite .",
    "irac mosaics were generated from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) basic calibrated data ( bcd ) product ( ver .",
    "s13.2 ) using a customized idl program .",
    "the central 154 @xmath6125 region of the nebula at 3.6 , 4.5 , 8.0 , 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath0  is displayed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "irs high - resolution spectra were extracted from the ssc bcd product ( ver .",
    "s14.0 ) using the irs team s spectral modeling , analysis , and reduction tool ( smart ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the spectra on the star were extracted using a full - slit width mode in both the short - high ( sh , 9.919.6  @xmath0 , 5@xmath411  slit ) and long - high ( lh , 18.737.2  @xmath0 , 11@xmath422  slit ) modules without off - source sky subtraction , the lh spectrum was scaled to match the continuum level of the sh spectrum .",
    "the scaled lh spectrum and the sh spectrum are plotted together in the top panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the irac images of the helix nebula show a bare point source at the location of the central star , wd 2226@xmath2210 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this central source is detected with flux densities of 374@xmath719 , 241@xmath724 , 171@xmath726 , and 174@xmath717 @xmath8jy at the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath0  irac bands , respectively .",
    "the flux densities in the first three bands are , within error limits , consistent with those expected from the rayleigh - jeans tail of a 110,000 k blackbody model normalized to the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) photometry of the star ( 2mass 22293854@xmath22050136 ) , @xmath9 = 14.332@xmath70.024 , @xmath10 = 14.490@xmath70.039 , and @xmath11 = 14.548@xmath70.079 .",
    "the flux density at 8  @xmath0  is , however , twice as high as expected .",
    "the mips images of the helix nebula show very different distributions of emission . in the 24  @xmath0  band",
    ", a pointlike source coincident with the central star is superposed on a plateau of diffuse emission . in the 70  @xmath0  band ,",
    "no diffuse emission is seen , and only a central pointlike source is detected . in the 160  @xmath0  band , neither the central source nor the bright diffuse emission is detected .    to analyze the central point - like source at 24  @xmath0",
    ", the bright diffuse background needs to be subtracted .",
    "the surface brightness of the diffuse emission falls off linearly with radius ( @xmath12 ) from the central star .",
    "therefore , we use a linear model fit to the surface brightness profile between @xmath12 = 31  and 100  to estimate the diffuse emission superposed on the central point - like source . after background subtraction , the central source appears slightly resolved with a fwhm of @xmath19 , 1.5 times that of a true point source , possibly due to an imperfect subtraction of the background .",
    "using aperture photometry and a color correction for a @xmath1100 k blackbody ( see  [ physical_structure ] for justification ) , the background - subtracted flux density of the central source is 48.4@xmath77.3 mjy in the 24  @xmath0  band .",
    "no variability is detected at 24  @xmath0  in our three observations .",
    "using a similar method , we measure a flux density of 224@xmath733 mjy in the 70  @xmath0  band and a 3 @xmath13 upper limit of 237 mjy in the 160  @xmath0  band .",
    "the detection of a point - like source in the mips 24 and 70  @xmath0  bands is puzzling because the large extent of the ionized nebula is well resolved with _ spitzer_.",
    "while the mips 24  @xmath0  flux from the unresolved source could originate from emission lines in the bandpass , the lines would have to originate in high - ionization stages from abundant elements .",
    "possible lines are the [ ] 24.32  @xmath0  line and [ ] 25.89  @xmath0  line , the latter having been suggested by @xcite from the _ iras _ observation . the ionization thresholds needed to produce ( 54.9 ev ) and to excite the @xmath144686 line by the ionization and recombination of ( 54.4 ev ) are similar .",
    "therefore , we resort to a @xmath144686 image of the helix nebula @xcite to assess the spatial extent of the [ ] emission at a higher resolution .",
    "the image of the helix nebula shows a central diffuse emission region similar to that seen at 24  @xmath0 , but not a point - like central source . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that the [ ] line contributes to the diffuse emission up to a radius of @xmath12 .",
    "the absence of the central point - like source in the image confirms that the [ ] line does not contribute to the central peak in the mips 24  @xmath0  band .",
    "another promising candidate is the [ ] 24.32  @xmath0  line . with an excitation potential of 97 ev , can be produced via photoionization by hard x - rays or thermal collisional ionization at temperatures ( @xmath15 ) higher than @xmath16 k. at such high temperatures , the @xmath144686 recombination line may be weakened to below the detection limit because of its @xmath17 dependence .",
    "while this might explain the absence of the central peak in the image , it can not explain the central point - like source in the mips 70  @xmath0  band , as this band does not contain any nebular lines of abundant elements at high ionization stages .    both [ ] and [ ] lines are seen in our irs spectrum of the central region ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) on top of a continuum ( a combination of dust grains in the ionized nebula , zodiacal background and the central point source ) . without a proper subtraction of the nebular and zodiacal contribution , it is difficult to assess the relative importance of the emission lines and the continuum from the central star based on this irs spectrum alone .",
    "the true spectrum of the central source is revealed after subtraction of the nebular and sky contribution ( shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of the central source will be addressed in more detail in another paper .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the central source is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "for the white dwarf , we employ tmap , the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package @xcite , in its most recent version for the calculation of plane - parallel , static white dwarf models that consider h  he  c  n  o  mg  si  ca  ni model atoms .",
    "the sed shortward of 6  @xmath0  is consistent with the scaled white dwarf photospheric model for 110,000 k. assuming that the excess infrared emission originates from a blackbody radiator , its temperature is 90130 k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , far too low for a stellar object .",
    "if the blackbody radiator is heated by the central star wd 2226@xmath2210 , of which the effective temperature is 110,000 k and radius is 0.024 @xmath18 , it would have to be 4191 au from the star .",
    "this radial distance corresponds to 019042 , so it can not be resolved with _",
    "spitzer_. the luminosity of this blackbody radiator , ( 5.111 ) @xmath410@xmath19 ergs s@xmath20 , requires a total cross section ( @xmath21 ) of ( 0.88.7 ) @xmath410@xmath22 @xmath23 , or 3.838 au@xmath24 .",
    "although we do not have any constraint on the geometry of the emission source , only an extended dust cloud , most probably a disk can provide such a large emitting area .",
    "the extinction toward the star is small based on the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "data @xcite , consistent with the 219 pc distance .",
    "the dust disk is likely to be optically thin and tilted since the main nebular ring is tilted by @xmath135  with respect to the line of sight @xcite .    given the evolution of the helix central star through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula phases , the presence of a debris disk from the stellar main - sequence phase is surprising but not entirely impossible .",
    "recently , dust disks around the white dwarf gd362 @xcite and the white dwarf g29 - 38 @xcite were reported ; these disks are closer to their central stars and thus have seds showing excess emission starting from the near - ir bands .",
    "the helix central star is much hotter and more luminous than these two white dwarfs ( i.e. , the helix central star is much less evolved along its cooling track than the other two ) ; thus it can heat a debris disk at a larger radial distance .      if the infrared excess around the helix central star indeed arises from a debris disk , the dust grains in the disk that dominate the radiation are likely to be microns to millimeters in size .",
    "the minimum grain size will be set by blowout by radiation pressure .",
    "given the stellar mass of 0.58 @xmath25 @xcite and a luminosity of 76 @xmath26 ( from the observed photometry and distance ) , grains smaller than @xmath160  @xmath0  will be ejected from the system . for an initial estimate , one can assume that the disk consists of grains with sizes ( radius of @xmath27 ) from 60 to 1000  @xmath0  and has a power - law size distribution , @xmath28 , as expected for a collision - dominated disk @xcite . the relatively large grains support using blackbody - based approximations to characterize the system .    for a simple estimate ,",
    "we take the disk dimensions from the preceding section and approximates the grain size distribution by a single size of 100  @xmath0 , characteristic of the grains that dominate the infrared emission .",
    "the dust mass in these grains is ( 4/3 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the grain density and @xmath21 is the total area that intercepts the star light .",
    "since the total dust mass is proportional to @xmath31 , the total dust mass from the disk is @xmath10.11 @xmath32 assuming @xmath30=2.5 g @xmath33 and @xmath346@xmath35@xmath23 .",
    "this rough estimate can be tested with a more realistic model that fits the sed , although such models are still subject to degeneracy and ambiguities .",
    "we assume that the grains are astronomical silicates @xcite with a size distribution as before .",
    "the disk is optically thin , is heated only by wd 2226210 , and has a constant surface number density , with inner and outer boundaries of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the observed sed is fitted by a ring extending from 35 to 150 au with a total dust mass of 0.13@xmath32(@xmath750% ) , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the exact inner radius of the disk is subject to the grain properties used in the model ; however , the inner radius can not be too close to the star because no observable excess is found at wavelengths shorter than 8  @xmath0 .",
    "an inner hole is required by the sed modeling .",
    "the outer boundary of the disk is constrained in our model because a disk with a much larger outer radius would have higher 160  @xmath0  flux , contradicting the observed upper limit .",
    "therefore , the dust around the helix central star is in a form of ring between @xmath135 and @xmath1150 au .",
    "this configuration is remarkably similar to the planetary debris disks seen around main - sequence stars .      what is the origin of the dust _",
    "spitzer _ detects around the helix central star ?",
    "it has been established that any planet closer than @xmath11 au will be engulfed by an expanding red giant @xcite , while planets outside @xmath15 au from the sun will survive post - main - sequence evolution @xcite , and the orbits of surviving planets and most of the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and oort cloud comets will expand adiabatically and remain bound to the solar system @xcite . the re - stabilized kbos and oort cloud can later become the source of objects that go into the inner part of the system , either plunging into the white dwarf or breaking up due to tidal destruction , and they can populate the inner system with dust . a similar scenario has been proposed to explain the photospheric metal contamination in daz white dwarfs @xcite and may even produce the observed x - ray emission at 1 kev .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest that if the surviving planet system becomes unstable after the agb phase , the entire system becomes dynamically young ; i.e. , frequent collisions and encounters can occur among surviving planets and comets , leading to a period of enhanced `` late bombardment '' .",
    "it is likely that the kilometer - size objects surviving around the helix central star are experiencing similar perturbations and producing fine dust in the system .",
    "the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) lifetime is @xmath38 yr for @xmath1100  @xmath0  grains located at 35 and 150 au , while the collisional lifetime is @xmath39 yr .",
    "note that these timescales are much longer than the kinematic age of the nebula ( 2.8@xmath40 yr ; @xcite ) and a typical timescale in the post - agb evolution ( @xmath41 yr for a 0.565 @xmath25 white dwarf ; @xcite ) .",
    "assuming an average dust lifetime of @xmath42 yr , the dust production rate is @xmath43 g  s@xmath20 .",
    "this rate is only a lower limit since the dust production is not in equilibrium , but it is @xmath1@xmath44 times the dust production rate observed from comet hale - bopp , consistent with the hypothesis of an enhanced late bombardment in the post - main - sequence evolution .    the total observed dust mass , @xmath10.13 @xmath32 , is equivalent to 20 asteroidal objects with a radius of @xmath11200 km . while the dust cloud around the white dwarf g2938 may arise from tidal disruption of pluto - sized objects @xcite , this can not be the case for the disk in wd 2226210 because the tidal disruption zone is much closer to the central star , @xmath10.003 au ( @xcite , eq.[4 ] ) .",
    "it is thus unlikely that the debris disk is produced by tidal breaking of large asteroidal objects , but rather by enhanced collisions among the surviving kuiper belt - like and/or cometary objects .",
    "the inner radius of a p - r drag - dominated disk , in general , should be very close to the star , up to the dust sublimation radius ( @xmath10.1 au in the case of the helix central star ) if there is no planet - size or sub - stellar object inside the disk to stop the dust grains from spiraling inward .",
    "the inner hole ( @xmath12@xmath4535 au ) derived from our sed model is likely caused by the dynamical perturbation of unseen planets or sub - stellar objects inside the hole , which can trap the migrating dust or scatter the dust outward @xcite . alternatively , the inner hole may also be explained by ice sublimation if the grains are icy @xcite , a process that will occur at a dust temperature of @xmath1150  k , corresponding to @xmath130 au .",
    "if the helix central star had a close binary in the main - sequence phase , a binary merger event could produce an accretion disk around the remaining white dwarf",
    ". the physical structure of the disk would be highly dependent on the properties of the original binary system ; however , the fact that there is no near - infrared excess suggests that the inner part of the optically thick accretion disk would have to dissipate in a short period of time after the binary merged .",
    "it is hard to explain why the dust is so far away from the white dwarf if it was the remnant disk due to close binary evolution . alternatively",
    "if the companion was in an intermediate orbit and avoided spiraling into the primary during the evolution , the binary configuration is efficient at trapping the dust from the mass loss of the primary to form a stable circumbinary disk in the post - agb phase @xcite , inducing the presence of the dusty disk we detected .",
    "however , any of the micron - size dust generated in the agb phase should be blown out by the strong radiation in the early white dwarf evolution . the fact that we do see dust around",
    "the helix central star favors the debris disk scenario .",
    "future high spatial resolution infrared imaging is needed to further constrain the geometry of the emitting region .",
