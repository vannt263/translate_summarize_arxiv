    "the @xmath0-mode instability @xcite belongs to the secular instability attributable to the so - called cfs mechanism @xcite that drives unstable various modes of oscillation in a rotating star .",
    "the @xmath0-modes excited in neutron stars are expected to work as a mechanism of decelerating the spin velocity of neutron stars by emitting gravitational waves , which will be detectable by ligo and other detectors @xcite .",
    "for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in old and cold neutron stars having the interior temperature below the superfluid transition temperatures @xmath8 ,",
    "neutrons in the inner crust and neutrons and protons in the core are believed to be in superfluid states @xcite .",
    "it is therefore likely that most of observed neutron stars , which have cooled down very quickly via emission of neutrinos @xcite , have a core with superfluids .",
    "one of the important effects of rotating superfluids in cold neutron stars is mutual friction , which provides a strong dissipation mechanism for the oscillation modes @xcite .",
    "the mutual friction is produced by scattering of normal fluid particles off the vortices in the rotating superfluids .",
    "lindblom and mendell @xcite calculated the mutual friction damping associated with the @xmath0-modes in neutron stars with a superfluid core and concluded that the mutual friction in the core is ineffective to suppress the @xmath0-mode instability .",
    "recently , lee and yoshida @xcite have studied the @xmath0-modes in neutron stars with the superfluid core using a different numerical method , confirming most of the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "lee and yoshida @xcite have also shown that the @xmath0-modes are split into ordinary fluid - like @xmath0-modes and superfluid - like @xmath0-modes , as first suggested by andersson and comer @xcite , and that the instability caused by the superfluid - like @xmath0-modes is extremely weak and easily damped by dissipation processes in the interior .",
    "very recently , yoshida and lee @xcite have calculated inertial modes of superfluid neutron stars , and shown that the inertial modes are also split into two families , namely , ordinary fluid - like inertial modes and superfluid - like inertial modes .",
    "it is quite reasonable since the @xmath0-modes belong to a subclass of the inertial modes .",
    "yoshida and lee @xcite found that all the inertial modes , except for the ordinary fluid - like @xmath0-modes , are strongly damped by the dissipation due to the mutual friction unless the entrainment effects between superfluids are extremely weak .",
    "most of the numerical studies on the @xmath0-modes and the inertial modes in superfluid neutron stars have been done within the framework of newtonian dynamics . since",
    "neutron stars are general relativistic objects having the typical relativistic factor @xmath9 of order of @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the gravitational mass and radius of the star , respectively , it is necessary to extend the newtonian analyses to general relativistic ones . in this paper , employing the two - constituent model developed by cater and his co - workers @xcite , and the formalism devised by lockitch , friedman , and andersson @xcite for inertial modes of relativistic normal fluid stars , we derive a general relativistic formulation for inertial mode oscillations in superfluid neutron stars . in sec .",
    "ii we present the basic equations employed in this paper for the dynamics of relativistic superfluids , and in sec .",
    "iii numerical results are given , and sec .",
    "iv is for discussions and conclusions . in this paper , we employ geometric units , given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and sign conventions used in @xcite .",
    "we assume neutron stars are composed of superfluid neutrons and a mixture of superfluid protons and normal fluid electrons . we assume perfect charge neutrality between the protons and the electrons because the plasma frequency of the mixture is much higher than the oscillation frequency considered in this study @xcite .",
    "the electrons therefore co - move with the protons .",
    "in other words , we do not need equations for describing the dynamics of the electrons . in the following ,",
    "we loosely call the mixture of the protons and electrons proton .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the superfluids in a neutron star , we employ the relativistic two - constituent formalism , which has been developed by carter and his co - workers @xcite . the fundamental quantity of carter s superfluid formalism is the so - called master function .",
    "although we have several choices for the master function , we take , following comer , langlois , and lin @xcite , the total thermodynamical energy density @xmath16 as the master function .",
    "the master function @xmath17 is assumed to depend on the three scalars @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the conserved number density current of the neutrons and the protons , respectively .",
    "once an explicit functional form of the master function is given , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where the scalar @xmath25 denotes the generalized pressure , defined by @xmath26 and the one - forms @xmath27 and @xmath28 mean the chemical potential covectors , defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 the one - forms @xmath27 and @xmath28 are conjugate momenta to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are interpreted as the chemical potentials of the neutrons and the protons , respectively . from equation ( [ def - coj - mom ] )",
    ", we can see that the thermodynamical quantity @xmath33 determines the strength of the entrainment effects between the two superfluids .",
    "in other words , if we have @xmath34 , there is no entrainment effect .",

    "equilibrium states of a slowly rotating star are described by the stationary axisymmetric spacetime , given by the line element @xmath43 here , we have taken account of the rotational effects up to the first order of the stellar rotation angular frequency . in this study , we assume that the neutron and proton superfluids in equilibrium are in the same rotational motion with the uniform rotation angular frequency @xmath44",
    ". the four - velocity of the two superfluids is therefore given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the time - like and rotational killing vectors of the spacetime .",
    "in virtue of equation ( [ eq - vel ] ) , the conjugate momentum one - forms in equilibrium reduce to @xmath48 and the energy - momentum tensor of an equilibrium star is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the projection tensor associated with the four - velocity @xmath38 , defined by @xmath51 .    substituting equations ( [ def - chemi0 ] ) into euler equations ( [ euler - eqs ] )",

    "the surface boundary conditions for the equilibrium structure are given as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath11 stands for the gravitational mass of the star .",
    "the boundary conditions at the stellar center are the regularity condition for all the physical quantities .",
    "to describe fluid perturbations in a star , it is convenient to introduce two kinds of changes in physical quantities , called the eulerian and the lagrangian changes @xcite .",
    "an eulerian change @xmath64 is the difference between the quantities @xmath65 in the perturbed and the unperturbed states at a spacetime point .",
    "the relation between the lagrangian changes and the eulerian changes are given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the lie derivative along the vector @xmath68 , and we have introduced the two distinct lagrangian displacement vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 to describe the perturbed motion of the neutron and proton superfluids because the two superfluids can move independently . the lagrangian displacement is regarded as a vector that connects fluid elements in the unperturbed state to the corresponding elements in the perturbed state .    we suppose that perturbations of any physical quantity can be expressed in terms of the lagrangian displacements @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the eulerian changes in the metric @xmath71 . according to similar consideration to that in @xcite ,",
    "we can write the lagrangian changes of the fluid velocities of the neutron and proton in terms of the lagrangian change in the metric : @xmath72 where @xmath73 here , we have used the relation @xmath74 in the equilibrium . in this study , we consider no transfusion between the neutrons and the protons .",
    "the particle numbers of the neutrons and the protons are therefore conserved separately .",

    "although comer and joynt @xcite have recently discussed in greater detail the entrainment effects in general relativistic superfluids , we use the master function given above for simplicity . in terms of the master function ( [ def - master ] ) , we can obtain the thermodynamical functions in pulsation equations as follows : @xmath108 where we have used the relation @xmath109 in the equilibrium .",

    "we expand the perturbations in terms of the tensor spherical harmonics with different @xmath119 s for a given @xmath5 . in this paper , we consider the oscillation modes associated with @xmath120 because we are interested in the modes that are unstable against gravitational radiation reactions .",
    "thus , we can select the so - called regge - wheeler gauge in order to fix the gauge freedom for the metric perturbations @xcite .",
    "then , the metric perturbations are expanded as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the spherical harmonic function , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 for even modes , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 for odd modes , where @xmath127 .",

    "<S> the @xmath0-modes of a relativistic superfluid star are split into two families , ordinary fluid - like @xmath0-modes ( @xmath2-mode ) and superfluid - like @xmath0-modes ( @xmath3-mode ) . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath7 almost linearly increases with increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the radiation driven instability due to the @xmath3-modes is much weaker than that of the @xmath2-modes because the matter current associated with the axial parity perturbations almost completely vanishes . </S>"
