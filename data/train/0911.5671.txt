    "since the discovery of graphene @xcite  a monolayer of carbon atoms  its unique physical characteristics have aroused enormous interest in the scientific community .",
    "particularly , the influence of electromagnetic field on electronic properties of graphene is in focus of attention @xcite .",
    "however all theoretical models , elaborated to describe this influence , deal with strong electromagnetic field in the framework of classical electrodynamics . a theory , capable of describing the strong interaction between electrons in graphene and quantized electromagnetic field , was unknown up to the present .",
    "the paper is aimed to fill partially this gap in the theory .",
    "it is surprising that the problem of interaction between electrons at the fermi level of graphene and circularly polarized photons can be solved exactly in analytical form without the need of any approximation and numerical calculations .",
    "this is one of few exactly solvable problems in the theory of photon - matter interaction , that is not without interest to both condensed matter physics and quantum optics .",
    "moreover , since electrons in graphene behave as massless relativistic fermions @xcite , graphene can serve as a low - energy ` proving ground ' for the relativistic physics @xcite",
    ". therefore the obtained solutions can also be useful to describe the interaction between relativistic particles and photons .",
    "thus the solved problem lies at the intersection of different excited fields of modern physics , that is what caused to write this paper .",
    "generally , electron states in graphene near the fermi energy are described by eight - component wave functions written in a basis corresponding to two crystal sublattices of graphene , two electron valleys , and two orientations of electron spin @xcite . in what follows intervalley scattering processes and spin effects",
    "will be beyond consideration , that reduces the number of necessary wave - function components to two . to describe the interaction between a plane monochromatic circularly polarized electromagnetic wave and electrons in a graphene , we shall be to use the cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 , where the axis @xmath1 is perpendicular to the graphene fixed at @xmath2 .",
    "then near the point at the fermi level , where the valence and conductivity bands of graphene touch each other ( the dirac point ) , the hamiltonian of electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field can be written for a single valley and for a certain direction of electron spin in the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is fermi velocity , @xmath5 is operator of electron momentum in the graphene plane , @xmath6 is electron charge , and @xmath7 is vector potential of the electromagnetic field . as to the vector operator @xmath8 , its components are pauli matrices written in the basis of two orthogonal electron states arisen from two crystal sublattices of graphene .",
    "since the operator @xmath9 is diagonal , these two states can be denoted by mutually opposite orientations of the pseudospin along the @xmath1-axis , @xmath10 .",
    "considering the problem within the standard quantum - field approach @xcite , the classical field , @xmath7 , should be replaced with the field operator , @xmath11 . assuming the electromagnetic wave to be clockwise - polarized and propagating along the @xmath1-axis , this operator can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is frequency of the electromagnetic wave , @xmath14 is volume of space with the field , @xmath15 are polarization vectors , @xmath16 are unit vectors directed along the @xmath17-axes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are photon operators of annihilation and creation , respectively , written in the schrdinger representation ( the representation of occupation numbers ) @xcite .",
    "then the complete hamiltonian of the electron - photon system , including both the field energy , @xmath20 , and the electron hamiltonian ( [ e ] ) rewritten in the quantum - field form , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 are step - up and step - down operators for the @xmath1-projection of the pseudospin .",
    "the stationary solutions of the effective dirac equation with the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) have the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is wave vector in the graphene plane , @xmath25 is radius - vector , and @xmath26 is eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath27 at the dirac point ( @xmath28 ) the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) is formally similar to the hamiltonian of exactly solvable jaynes - cummings model @xcite . as a consequence , the effective dirac equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) for @xmath28",
    "can also be solved exactly . to describe the electron - photon system at the dirac point ,",
    "let us use the notation @xmath29 which indicates that the electron is in one of two quantum states with the pseudospin projections @xmath10 and the electromagnetic field is in quantum state with the photon occupation number @xmath30 .",
    "then exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) for @xmath28 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 energies of the electron - photon states ( [ phi ] ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are given by @xmath37 and subscript indices in eqs .",
    "( [ phi])([energy ] ) indicate genesis of these states : the state @xmath38 turns into the state @xmath39 when the electron - photon interaction vanishes ( i.e. for @xmath40 ) . the expressions ( [ phi])([energy ] ) can be easily verified by direct substitution into the effective dirac equation @xmath41 with the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) for @xmath28 , keeping in mind the trivial relations @xcite @xmath42 let the photon occupation number of the electromagnetic field ( [ a ] ) is fixed at @xmath43 by a field source .",
    "then the electron - photon states @xmath44 and @xmath45 , originated from electron states degenerated at the dirac point , are separated by the energy gap @xmath46 . in what follows we shall be to assume the electromagnetic wave to be classically strong , that corresponds to macroscopically large photon occupation numbers ( @xmath47 ) . then the gap can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is energy of electron rotational motion induced by the circularly polarized wave , and @xmath50 is classical amplitude of electric field of the wave .",
    "let us proceed to solving the effective dirac equation with the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) near the dirac point for wave vectors @xmath51 .",
    "since the obtained electron - photon states ( [ phi ] ) are eigenstates of the same hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) for @xmath28 , they form complete basis of the considered electron - photon system . therefore",
    "true eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) for @xmath51 can be sought as an expansion @xmath52.\\ ] ] substituting the expansion ( [ psi ] ) into the effective dirac equation @xmath53 with the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) , we arrive at the system of recurrent algebraic equations for coefficients @xmath54 .",
    "this system can be easily solved in the special case , when the effective parameter of electron - field interaction , @xmath55 , satisfies the condition @xmath56 .",
    "seeking the dispersion dependencies @xmath57 and @xmath54 for any @xmath24 in the principal order with respect to @xmath58 , the system of recurrent equations can be reduced to the two equations @xmath59 which can be solved exactly . solving eqs .",
    "( [ ae1])([ae2 ] ) by conventional methods , we obtain two branches of the energy spectrum , @xmath57 , which can be written as @xmath60 where omitted @xmath24-terms are @xmath61 . as a result ,",
    "eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are given by @xmath62\\,,\\ ] ] where superscript indexes ` @xmath63 ' denote solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ ae1])([ae2 ] ) corresponding to the two energy branches ( [ energyk ] ) .",
    "as expected , for @xmath28 the obtained expressions ( [ energyk])([psi ] ) coincide with the exact solutions ( [ energy])([phi ] ) .",
    "the full energy of the electron - photon system ( [ energyk ] ) consists of the field energy , @xmath64 , and the term @xmath65 which is arisen from electron - photon interaction . as a consequence , an electron interacting with circularly polarized photons can be considered formally as a quasiparticle with the energy spectrum ( [ ek ] ) . from the viewpoint of classical electrodynamics ,",
    "the circularly polarized electromagnetic wave rotates the electron @xcite .",
    "therefore the quasiparticle is the mix of photon states and electron states corresponding to this rotational motion of the electron .",
    "certainly , a center of trajectory of the rotating electron can move in the graphene plane , that corresponds to a translational motion of the quasiparticle as a whole .",
    "the translational motion is described in eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) by the wave vector of quasiparticle , @xmath24 .",
    "since the quasiparticle is _ rotating _ electron dressed by circularly polarized photons , this wave vector differs from the wave vector of free electron in graphene .    the energy spectrum of quasiparticles ( [ ek ] ) ,",
    "schematically pictured in fig .",
    "1a , defines optical and transport properties of graphene irradiated by circularly polarized light .",
    "the distinctive feature of the spectrum ( [ ek ] ) is the energy gap ( [ gap ] ) between quasiparticle states originated from valence and conductivity bands of graphene .",
    "formally , the value of the photon - induced gap in the limit of large radiation intensities , given by eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , is the same as the value of dynamical gap induced at the dirac point of graphene by a classical circularly polarized electromagnetic wave @xcite .",
    "however , there is a conceptual difference between the _ stationary _ energy gap ( [ gap ] ) arisen from quantum - field theory and _ dynamical _ gaps @xcite arisen in graphene from classical fields .",
    "historically , the term ` dynamical gap ' is come into the theory of graphene - field interaction @xcite from the general theory @xcite developed to describe different quantum systems exposed to time - dependent classical fields and denotes the gap in spectrum of floquet quasienergies .",
    "thus the dynamical gap is not true gap in the density of states of charge carriers . as it was specially stressed in ref .",
    ", `` since it is time - dependent problem , one can not measure the gap directly from the density of states '' .",
    "in contrast to the dynamical gap , the gap ( [ gap ] ) is obtained from stationary solutions of the time - independent dirac problem for the electron - photon system and is true gap in the density of bound electron - photon states ( charged quasiparticles ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the stationary gap ( [ gap ] ) will be to manifest itself directly in all phenomena sensitive to the density of states of charge carriers .",
    "in other words , the incorporation of such an additional physical factor as a quantum nature of electromagnetic field into the theory of graphene - field interaction , presented in the given paper , allows to consider the strong interacting electron - photon system in graphene as a gas of noninteracting quasiparticles with density of states defined by the energy spectrum ( [ ek ] ) .",
    "since the quasiparticle concept is conventional approach of the modern physics to describe quantum systems with a strong interaction , the developed theory is fruitful to predict and analyze different unexplored phenomena in graphene irradiated by light  particularly , novel physical effects discussed hereafter .    if another electromagnetic field with the frequency @xmath66 is applied to the considered electron - photon system , optical transitions of quasiparticles between its valence and conductivity bands can be possible .",
    "it follows from the energy conservation law that the transitions are allowed for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the gap ( [ gap ] ) results in the threshold of absorption of an external field at the frequency @xmath69 . since the threshold frequency , @xmath70 ,",
    "is controlled by the field intensity , @xmath71 , this effect can be used as a basis for tunable detectors of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the transition rate at the threshold frequency is defined by the interband dipole matrix element @xmath72 where @xmath73 is dipole moment operator , and @xmath74 .",
    "besides optical transitions induced by the external field , there is the quasiparticle transition at the frequency @xmath13 , @xmath75 which is accompanied by one - photon absorption of the field ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this transition , pictured in fig .",
    "1b , needs a special discussion since the field ( [ a ] ) is inherent in the solved dirac problem and can not be considered as an external field .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ energyk ] ) that for @xmath76 there is the wave vector , @xmath77 , satisfying the condition @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the transition ( [ t ] ) is allowed by the energy conservation law for @xmath76 and can take place at @xmath79 without the assistance of external energy sources .",
    "however the field ( [ a ] ) has been accounted exactly by the complete hamiltonian of the electron - photon system ( [ h ] ) and can not lead directly to transitions between different stationary states of the same hamiltonian . to realize the transition ( [ t ] ) , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "should be mixed by an external elastic scatterer ( for example , by a defect of graphene lattice ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , we can calculate the matrix element @xmath82 which defines the rate of transition ( [ t ] ) for any scatterring field @xmath83 . in the absence of scatterers , when @xmath84 ( or , generally , @xmath85 ) , the matrix element ( [ matr ] ) is zero and the transition is impossible .",
    "thus the quasiparticle transition ( [ t ] ) is scatterer - assisted process .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "1b that excited quasiparticles , accomplishing a cascade of non - radiative thermalization transitions after the transition ( [ t ] ) , can create a population inversion between the conductivity band and the valence band at @xmath28 . since the interband dipole moment ( [ d ] ) is nonzero , that results in light emission from graphene at the threshold frequency , @xmath70 , controlled by the field intensity , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the scheme , pictured in fig .",
    "1b , forms a physical basis for creating tunable sources of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the proposed mechanisms for tunable detection and generation of electromagnetic radiation are especially challenging for the thz frequency range . indeed , search for effective thz sources and detectors is one of most excited problems of modern applied physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latest trend is the using of different nanostructures to fill the thz gap @xcite . therefore the application of graphene for thz devices",
    "fits well current tendencies in the graphene - based quantum electronics @xcite and the nanophotonics as a whole .",
    "formally , the energy spectrum ( [ ek ] ) is of dielectric type for any field intensity , @xmath71 .",
    "however the interband transition ( [ t ] ) leads to generation of free charge carriers in valence and conductivity bands for @xmath76 . to turn graphene into true insulator , we need to forbid the transition ( [ t ] ) by the energy conservation law .",
    "this forbidding corresponds to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the metal - insulator transition in graphene is a threshold effect and occurs at the critical field intensity , @xmath87 , satisfying the condition @xmath88 . using eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , we obtain @xmath89 being in the insulator state for @xmath90 , graphene has zero conductivity for the temperature @xmath91 and behaves as a semiconductor for @xmath92 . applying the conventional theory of semiconductors @xcite to graphene for @xmath90 and @xmath93",
    ", we can write the total density of free charge carriers for a single valley of graphene and for a certain direction of electron spin in the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is effective mass of quasiparticles , which defines their energy spectrum , @xmath96 for small quasiparticle wave vectors @xmath24 . considering @xmath24-terms in the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) as a perturbation and using the standard perturbation theory @xcite , we can find the energy spectrum of quasiparticles near their band edge as a @xmath24-power series expansion without assuming weakness of the field ( the parameter of electron - field interaction , @xmath55 , is allowed to be not small ) . obtaining terms @xmath97 in the spectrum ,",
    "we arrive at the exact expression for the effective mass @xmath98}\\,.\\ ] ] it should be noted that the energy spectrums of quasiparticles ( [ ek ] ) and ( [ ek2 ] ) are mutually complementary : eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) is applicable within a broad range of wave vectors but only for small field intensities ( @xmath56 ) , and eq .",
    "( [ ek2 ] ) with the effective mass ( [ m ] ) is valid for any field intensities but only for small wave vectors ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "as expected , eqs .",
    "( [ ek ] ) and ( [ ek2 ] ) are equal for small field intensities and small wave vectors .",
    "finalizing the paper , we have to estimate the effects discussed above .",
    "the distance between neighboring electron - photon states ( [ energy ] ) is characterized by the two energies , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the destructive influence of scattering processes on quasiparticles can be neglected if @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104c is mean free time of charge carriers in graphene @xcite .",
    "thus the developed concept of quasiparticles is applicable if the field ( [ a ] ) is both high - frequency and strong .",
    "particularly , such a field can be created by using lasers .",
    "let the wave is generated by a laser with the wavelength @xmath105 and focused into a narrow beam with the diameter @xmath106 .",
    "then the wave amplitude is @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is output power of the laser . within this scheme the condition of metal - insulator transition ( [ mit ] ) can be satisfied , for instance , by using an ordinary low - power co@xmath109-laser with @xmath110 m and @xmath111  watts . in this case",
    "the gap ( [ gap ] ) is @xmath112  mev , that allows to observe the metal - insulator transition at room temperatures . as to the effect of thz emission from irradiated graphene",
    ", it takes place for substantially smaller powers @xmath113",
    "w.    as it follows from the estimations given above , the considered phenomena can be observable in graphene under a _ low - power _ irradiation .",
    "this is surprising , since a _ high - power _ laser radiation is usually necessary to observe effects of strong electron - photon coupling @xcite .",
    "let us give simple physical reasons to clarify this unexpected result . from the quasi - classical viewpoint ,",
    "the characteristic energy of electron coupling to circularly polarized electromagnetic wave is the kinetic energy of electron rotational motion induced by the wave . in the case of an usual condensed matter with parabolic electron energy spectrum , @xmath114",
    ", this kinetic energy is @xmath115 . as to graphene , due to its linear electron energy spectrum , @xmath116 ,",
    "the energy of the electron rotational motion induced by the wave is @xmath49 .",
    "since we have @xmath117 for weak fields @xmath71 , the electron coupling to a low - power circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation is substantially stronger in graphene than in other condensed matters .",
    "the observability of the discussed effects for a low - power laser pumping is crucial from experimental viewpoint , since high - power lasers fluidize a crystal lattice and are inapplicable to condensed - matter experiments .",
    "thus graphene gives an unique opportunity to observe effects of strong electron - photon coupling , which can not be observed in other condensed matters . as a result",
    ", the presented theory opens a significant new area of graphene - related research , where condensed matter physics and quantum optics meet .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dirac electron spectrum of graphene leads to the strong electron interaction with circularly polarized photons for low light intensities .",
    "this results in bound electron - photon states ( charged quasiparticles ) which should be considered as a substantially new kind of field - matter coupling .",
    "the energy spectrum of the quasiparticles is of dielectric type , that leads to the photon - induced metal - insulator transition . from applied viewpoint",
