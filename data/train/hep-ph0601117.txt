    "along with the pomeron , which appears in qcd as a compound state of two reggeized gluons @xcite , the hadron phenomenology requires reggeons , which can be constructed as colorless states of reggeized quarks and antiquarks .",
    "it demands further development of the theory of quark reggeization @xcite in qcd .",
    "till now , this theory remains less developed than the reggeized gluon theory , although a noticeable progress was achieved in the last years , in particular , the multi  particle reggeon vertices required in the next  to  leading approximation ( nla ) were found @xcite , and the next  to  leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the vertices appearing in the the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) were calculated @xcite .",
    "all these calculations were performed assuming the quark reggeization hypothesis . however , this hypothesis was not proved even in the lla , where merely its self  consistency was shown , in all orders of @xmath0 , but only in a particular case of elastic quark  gluon scattering  @xcite .",
    "recently , the hypothesis was tested at the nlo in order @xmath1 in  @xcite , where its compatibility with high - energy behaviour of the two  loop quark ",
    "gluon scattering amplitude was shown and the nlo correction to the quark trajectory was found in the limit of the space  time dimension @xmath2 .",
    "then , by the explicit two  loop calculations with the help of @xmath3channel unitarity @xcite the hypothesis was checked and corresponding correction to the quark trajectory was found at arbitrary @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we suggest a complete proof of the quark reggeization hypothesis in the lla for any quark  gluon inelastic process in all orders of @xmath0 . the proof is based on the relations required by compatibility of the multi ",
    "regge form of qcd amplitudes with the @xmath3channel unitarity ( bootstrap relations ) .",
    "we derive these relations and show that their fulfilment guaranties the multi  regge form .",
    "fulfilment of bootstrap relations is secured by several conditions ( bootstrap conditions ) on the reggeon vertices and trajectories .",
    "we explicitly show that these conditions are satisfied by the known expressions for the vertices and trajectories .",
    "the method of the proof is similar to one used for proving of the gluon reggeization in the nla @xcite , but instead of passing to partial waves we apply recently introduced operator formalism @xcite extended to consideration of inelastic amplitudes and quark exchanges .",

    "the only kinematics which is essential in the lla is the multi  regge kinematics ( mrk ) which means that all particles participating in a high  energy process are well separated in the rapidity space and have limited transverse momenta .",
    "let us consider the process @xmath5 in the mrk .",
    "we will use light - cone momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and denote @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 , where the sign @xmath11 means transverse to the @xmath12 plane components .",
    "we assume that initial momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for denotations ) have predominant components along @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "for generality we do not assume that transverse components @xmath15 and @xmath16 are zero , but @xmath17 and remain limited ( do not grow ) at @xmath18 . for the final particle momenta @xmath19 , we assume the mrk conditions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are limited .",

[ fig2]a ) @xmath69 and ( see fig . [ fig2]b ) ) @xmath70 in the case of reggeized quarks @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check , that these vertices are gauge invariant , since @xmath71 in the gauges ( [ n2-gauge ] ) and ( [ n1-gauge ] ) the vertices can be presented as @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",

    "we will need more general multi ",
    "particle amplitudes @xmath81 , but in the same multi  regge kinematics .",
    "assuming the same ordering in longitudinal components , the amplitudes @xmath82 can be obtained from @xmath83 by usual crossing rules .",
    "note that in we neglect imaginary parts of the amplitude since they are subleading .",
    "therefore the crossing rules for the transition to the amplitudes do not affect the regge factors @xmath84 .    here",
    "it seems sensible to make two remarks .",
    "the first one is that the hypothesis means much more than it is usually included in the notion `` reggeization '' of elementary particles .",
    "it means not only existence of the reggeons with gluon and quark quantum numbers and trajectories , but also that in the lla all the mrk amplitudes are determined only by the reggeon exchanges , i.e. only amplitudes with reggeon quantum numbers ( that means , in particular , colour octet for pure gluon exchanges and colour triplet for exchanges with flavour ) do survive . the second remark concerns signature .",
    "as compared with ordinary particles reggeons possess additional quantum numbers  signature , negative for the reggeized gluon and positive for the reggeized quark .",
    "therefore , in order to affirm that the amplitude is given by the reggeon exchanges we need to show that it has corresponding signatures in all @xmath27channels .    in order to construct amplitudes with definite signatures one needs to perform `` signaturization '' .",
    "in general the signaturization is not a simple task .",
    "it requires partial - wave decomposition of amplitudes in cross - channels with subsequent symmetrization ( anti  symmetrization ) in `` scattering angles '' and analytical continuation into the @xmath3channel .",
    "the procedure is relatively simple only in the case of elastic scattering of spin - zero particles .",
    "at that , generally speaking , even in this case the amplitudes with definite signatures can not be expressed in terms of physical amplitudes related by crossing .",
    "fortunately , at high energy the signaturization can be easily done not only for elastic , but in the mrk also for inelastic amplitudes , for particles with spin as well as for spin ",
    "zero ones .",
    "the signaturization ( as well as crossing relations ) is naturally formulated for `` truncated '' amplitudes , i.e. for amplitudes with omitted wave functions ( polarization vectors and dirac spinors ) .",
    "the crucial points are that in the mrk all energy invariants @xmath85 are large and that they are determined only by longitudinal components of momenta ( @xmath86 ) . due to largeness of @xmath85 signaturization in the @xmath87channel",
    "means symmetrization ( anti  symmetrization ) with respect to the substitution @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath85 are determined by longitudinal components , it can be considered as the substitution @xmath89 ( or , equivalently , @xmath90 ) in truncated amplitudes without change of transverse components .",
    "note that such substitution does not violate momentum conservation due to strong ordering of the longitudinal components . at that , all particles remain on their mass shell , so that the substitution is equivalent to transition into the cross - channel .    in order to understand behaviour of the amplitudes under the signaturization",
    "it is convenient to take the gluon production vertices in the physical light ",
    "cone gauges with gauge  fixing vectors @xmath7 or @xmath6 ( see , ) . at that",
    ", it becomes evident that they do not depend on longitudinal components of momenta , as well as the ppr vertices for the reggeized quark after omitting of wave functions .",
    "on the contrary , the quark and antiquark production vertices and contain explicitly longitudinal components , so that they change their signs at the transition into the cross - channel . the same is true for the ppr vertices with the reggeized gluon : for the vertices for gluon scattering because they are proportional to longitudinal components , and for the vertices for quark and antiquark scattering because of difference in their signs .",
    "after these remarks , with account of the fact that in the lla change of signs of @xmath91 does not affect the regge factors , it is not difficult to see that the amplitudes are invariant with respect to the signaturization described above , i.e. they have corresponding signatures in each of the @xmath27channels .",
    "the proof of the form ( [ inelastic quark ] ) is based on use of the @xmath3channel unitarity , which provides us with discontinuities @xmath92 ( i.e. imaginary parts ) of the amplitudes in the @xmath85 channels .",
    "we need to connect the amplitudes themselves ( which are real in the lla ) with these discontinuities .",
    "it is not difficult to do for elastic amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite not so for inelastic amplitudes .",
    "analytical properties of the production amplitudes are very complicated even in the mrk @xcite . but",
    "fortunately , it turns out , that in the lla these properties are greatly simplified and allow us to express partial derivatives @xmath93 of the amplitudes , considered as a function of @xmath94 and transverse momenta , in terms of the discontinuities of the signaturized amplitudes .",
    "it permits us to find all the mrk amplitudes loop by loop in the perturbation theory , using the born form of these amplitudes and the unitarity relations .",
    "note that in the born approximation the representation was proved in @xcite with the help of the @xmath95channel unitarity .    for the elastic amplitude",
    "the partial derivative @xmath96 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath3channel discontinuity quite easily .",
    "for the signaturized amplitudes radiative corrections depend on @xmath3 only in the form @xmath97 independently of signature . with the lla accuracy we can put @xmath98~. \\label{dis1}\\ ] ] therefore we have ( the superscript @xmath99 means signaturization ) @xmath100/{a}^\\text{born}_{2\\rightarrow 2}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln s } \\ ; \\left[{a}^\\mathcal{s}_{2\\rightarrow 2}/{a}^\\text{born}_{2\\rightarrow 2}\\right]~.\\label{dis2}\\ ] ] division by the born amplitude is performed in order to differentiate @xmath3dependence of radiative corrections only .    in the case of @xmath101",
    "the main complication is that instead of @xmath3 we have @xmath102 large invariants @xmath22 , which are not independent because of the equalities .",
    "equalities like connecting discontinuities in each of the channels and corresponding derivatives of the amplitude do not exist .",
    "however there are equalities @xcite connecting definite combinations of the discontinuities and the derivatives @xmath103 : @xmath104\\ , .",

    "the amplitude is expressed in terms of @xmath105 and transverse momenta ; the index @xmath106 takes values from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "equalities can be easily proved with use of the steinmann relations , or , more definitely , of the statement @xcite that the amplitude can be presented as a sum of contributions corresponding to various sets of @xmath108 nonoverlapping channels @xmath109 ; at that each of the contributions can be written as a signaturized series in logarithms of energy variables @xmath110 with coefficients which are real function of transverse momenta .",
    "remind that two channels @xmath111 and @xmath112 are called overlapping if either @xmath113 , or @xmath114 .",
    "what is important :     energy variables @xmath110 are independent , since the relations concern with overlapping channels ; it means , in particular , that we need to consider only leading orders in logarithms of these variables ;     we need not to consider the coefficients depending on transverse momenta neither calculating the discontinuities , nor calculating derivatives over @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , since scattering amplitudes enter the relations linearly and uniformly , it is sufficient to prove these relations in the leading order for the symmetrized products @xmath116 instead of @xmath117 . here",
    "the exponents @xmath118 are different from zero only for some set of nonoverlapping channels and are arbitrary in all other respects ; @xmath119 means symmetrization with respect to simultaneous change of signs of all @xmath85 with @xmath120 , performed independently for each @xmath121 . indeed , due to above mentioned arbitrariness of @xmath122 fulfilment of for @xmath123 guarantees it for any logarithmic series .    with @xmath118 calculating discontinuity of @xmath123 in one of the invariants",
    "@xmath85 we can neglect in the leading order signs of other invariants , so that we have @xmath124 from other hand , taking into account that with the lo accuracy , @xmath125 we have @xmath126 from and it follows that the equalities are fulfilled .",
    "these equalities allow us to express all partial derivatives @xmath127 through the discontinuities .",
    "note that from @xmath128 equalities considered as equations for the derivatives only @xmath108 are linear independent , that can be easily seen taking sum of the equations over @xmath129 .",
    "note here that requirement of equality of mixed derivatives taking in different orders imposes strong restrictions on the discontinuities .",
    "if they are fulfilled , the amplitude is unambiguously defined by its value at @xmath130 , i.e. in the born approximation .",
    "it means that the equalities permit to find in the lla all the mrk amplitudes using the born approximation for them and the @xmath3channel unitarity .",
    "indeed , at some number @xmath131 of loops the discontinuities entering can be expressed with the help of the @xmath3channel unitarity through the amplitudes with smaller number of loops . therefore starting with the expression in the born approximation ( as it was already mentioned , in this approximation it was proved for arbitrary @xmath132 @xcite with the help of the @xmath95channel unitarity ) we can calculate loop  by  loop all radiative corrections to the born amplitudes and examine the formula .    instead of such calculations it is sufficient , since the amplitudes are determined unambiguously , to check that the reggeized form satisfies . substituting into the r.h.s .",
    "of we obtain the bootstrap relations : @xmath133 \\frac{s_{k+1}^{\\omega_{k+1}}}{d_{k+1 } }      \\prod_{i = k+2}^{n+1}\\left(\\gamma^{p_{i-1}}_{{\\mathcal{r}}_{i-1}{\\mathcal{r}}_{i } } \\frac{s_{i}^{\\omega_i } } { d_i}\\right )      { \\gamma}^{{\\mathcal{r}}_{n+1}}_{b'b}\\ , .",

    "must be calculated using the unitarity relations and the anzats . since number of the bootstrap relations is infinite it is quite nontrivial to satisfy all of them using only several reggeon vertices and trajectories .",
    "a crucial for the reggeization hypothesis fact , which is demonstrated below , is that all these relations are fulfilled if the reggeized vertices and trajectories satisfy several equations called bootstrap conditions . in the following we derive these conditions and",
    "demonstrate that they are satisfied .",

    "let us start with the elastic amplitude .",
    "for the process @xmath135 the discontinuity is @xmath136 where @xmath119 is the signaturization operator , the sum is taken over discrete quantum states of intermediate particles as well as over their number , @xmath137 is their phase  space element , and the hermicity property of the amplitudes is used .",
    "the discontinuity is presented schematically at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the circles on the lines @xmath138 and @xmath139 mean the signaturization ( evidently its execution for both lines gives the same result as for one of them ) .    to calculate the discontinuity we need to convolute reggeon vertices and to integrate over momenta of particles in the intermediate states .",
    "all convolutions are known long ago @xcite .",
    "the important fact is that they do not depend on longitudinal momenta . in order to present them , and then the discontinuities , in a compact way it is convenient to use operator denotations in the transverse momentum , colour and spin space .",
    "we will use also denotations which accumulate all these quantum numbers .",
    "thus , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are `` bra'' and `` ket''vectors for the @xmath95 channel states of the reggeized gluon with transverse momentum @xmath142 and colour index @xmath143 .",
    "it is convenient to define the scalar product @xmath144 analogously , @xmath145 and @xmath146 with the scalar product @xmath147 denote the @xmath95 channel states of the reggeized quark with transverse momentum @xmath142 , colour index @xmath148 and spinor index @xmath149 .",

    "now we turn to the fermion - type @xmath95channel states .    using the ppr vertices",
    "and we obtain @xmath272 evidently , here in the first term intermediate particles are gluons and in the second  quarks . note that due to the signaturization only @xmath95channel colour triplet does survive . to obtain one",
    "needs to perform commutations of gamma matrices and to omit leftmost matrices @xmath273 , that can be done due to the strong ordering . the same we will do in the following with rightmost @xmath274 .    in the same way we obtain @xmath275 and @xmath276 @xmath277 these equations give @xmath278 @xmath279 according to the definition",
    ", the bootstrap condition is fulfilled for the case of fermion - type @xmath95channel states also , with the universal state @xmath280 , defined by its matrix elements @xmath281 @xmath282 now let us demonstrate that the states @xmath269 and @xmath280 are the eigenstate of the kernel @xmath227 with the eigenvalues @xmath283 and @xmath284 correspondingly . first we need to obtain explicit expressions for matrix elements of the operator @xmath285 . for matrix elements between states of two reggeized gluons",
    "we obtain , using the vertices ( actually it is much more convenient to take them in any of the gauges , ) and the definition of @xmath286 given just after : @xmath287 @xmath288    @xmath289    now it is easy to see that the state @xmath290 is the eigenstate of @xmath291 . indeed , since this operator conserves fermion number , it is sufficient , with account of the completeness condition and , to show that @xmath292 using , and it is easy to obtain @xmath293 @xmath294 using the representation for trajectories in , we see that it is satisfied , i.e. indeed @xmath295 is the eigenstate of the kernel with the eigenvalue @xmath296 .",
    "turn now to the fermion - type states .",
    "the matrix elements between the states of reggeized gluon and reggeized quark correspond to @xmath297 @xmath298 where @xmath299 and @xmath300 @xmath301 where @xmath302 in order to prove that the state @xmath303 is the eigenstate of @xmath291 we need , taking into account and , to show that @xmath304 using ,  , and , , it is easy to obtain @xmath305 @xmath306 together with the representation it shows that is satisfied , i.e. @xmath307 is the eigenstate of the kernel with the eigenvalue @xmath308 .",
    "the normalization conditions follow immediately from , , .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that the conditions  are satisfied .",
    "let us turn now to the last conditions .",
    "we will consider the bootstrap conditions for `` ket''vectors and use the light - cone gauge .",
    "first we need to find explicit expressions for the impact factors of reggeon - particle transitions and the matrix elements of the production operator @xmath213 between the vectors @xmath309 and two - reggeon states .",
    "the expressions for the impact factors are calculated using their definition and the vertices , , . to find the matrix elements of the production operator we use the definitions of @xmath213 , the vectors , , and the completeness condition .",
    "let us start with gluon production . in the case of boson - type @xmath310channel",
    "we obtain for the impact factor @xmath311 @xmath312 @xmath313 for corresponding martix element of the kernel only two - gluon intermediate states in the completeness condition contribute , with the result @xmath314 @xmath315 now , with account of , it is quite easy to obtain @xmath316 which proves the bootstrap condition for this case .",
    "another possibility for gluon production is fermion ",
    "type @xmath310channel . in this case",
    "we have to consider projections on two different two - reggeon states : @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "for the first one we obtain @xmath319 @xmath320\\left(\\gamma_\\bot + 2(m-\\hat q_{(j+1)\\bot})\\frac{(k_{j}+r_2)_\\bot}{(k_{j}+r_2)_\\bot^2}\\right ) + t^{{g}_j}t^{{{\\mathcal{g}}}_{2}}\\gamma_\\bot\\frac{1}{m-(\\hat k_{j}+\\hat r_1)_\\bot}\\hat r_{2\\bot}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] calculating corresponding matrix element of the kernel one needs to take again only intermediate states of one type ( @xmath321 ) in the completeness condition .",
    "the result is @xmath322\\left ( \\frac{(k_{j}+r_{2})_\\bot}{(k_{j}+r_{2})^2_{\\bot}}- \\frac{k_{j\\bot } } { k^2_{j\\bot}}\\right)\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath323 so that , with account of , we obtain @xmath324 so that the bootstrap condition is also fulfilled for this case .    the projection on the state @xmath318",
    "is considered quite analogously .",
    "we obtain @xmath325 @xmath326\\left(\\gamma_\\bot + 2(m-\\hat q_{(j+1)\\bot})\\frac{(k_{j}+r_1)_\\bot}{(k_{j}+r_1)_\\bot^2 } \\right)-t^{{g}_j}t^{{{\\mathcal{g}}}_{1}}\\gamma_\\bot\\frac{1}{m-(\\hat k_{j}+\\hat r_2)_\\bot}\\hat r_{1\\bot}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath327\\left ( \\frac{(k_{j}+r_{1})_\\bot}{(k_{j}+r_{1})^2_{\\bot}}- \\frac{k_{j\\bot } } { k^2_{j\\bot}}\\right)\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath328 so that , with account of , @xmath329 and we see that the bootstrap condition is also satisfied .",
    "let us consider now antiquark production . here",
    "again we have to consider projections on the states @xmath317 and @xmath318 . in the first case we obtain for the impact factor @xmath330",
    "@xmath331\\left(\\hat q_{(j+1)\\bot } -(\\hat k_{j}+\\hat r_1)_\\bot\\frac{q^2_{(j+1)\\bot}}{(k_{j}+r_1)^2_\\bot } \\right)\\right)\\upsilon_{\\bar{q}_j } \\,.\\ ] ] in the matrix element of the kernel now one needs to take intermediate states of the type @xmath332 .",
    "we obtain @xmath333 \\frac{\\hat r_{1\\bot}+\\hat k_{j\\bot}}{(r_{1}+k_{j})_\\bot^2 } \\upsilon_{\\bar{q}_j}\\,,\\ ] ] so that , with account of , we see that the bootstrap condition for this case is also fulfilled , @xmath334 which proves the bootstrap condition for this case .",
    "the projection on the @xmath335state is considered quite similarly .",
    "we have @xmath336 @xmath337\\left(\\hat q_{(j+1)\\bot } -(\\hat k_{j}+\\hat r_2)_\\bot\\frac{q^2_{(j+1)\\bot}}{(k_{j}+r_2)^2_\\bot}\\right ) -t^{{{\\mathcal{g}}}_{j+1}}t^{{{\\mathcal{g}}}_{1}}\\hat q_{(j+1)\\bot}\\right ) \\upsilon_{\\bar{q}_j}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath338 \\frac{\\hat r_{2\\bot}+\\hat k_{j\\bot } } { ( r_{2}+ k_{j})_\\bot^2 } \\upsilon_{\\bar{q}_j}\\,,\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath339    finally , we consider quark production . here",
    "we need to consider only progection on @xmath340state .",
    "it is easy to obtain @xmath341 @xmath342 where the additional @xmath343 is introduced to avoid double counting caused by the fact that the vertices @xmath344 and @xmath345 are both include @xmath183 for antiquark in the intermediate state . here in the matrix element of the kernel intermediate states @xmath321 and @xmath346 contribute .",
    "the result is @xmath347 @xmath348 with account of we obtain , @xmath349 it concludes the proof of the bootstrap relations .",
    "the multi  regge kinematics plays an outstanding role in high energy physics .",
    "it is extremely important since it gives a dominant contribution to total cross sections of particle interactions .",
    "the remarkable phenomenon is that qcd amplitudes in this kinematics have simple multi ",
    "regge form and are expressed in terms of the gluon and quark regge trajectories and a few vertices of reggeon interactions .    the multi  regge form of amplitudes containing quark exchanges was proposed in @xcite long ago , but up to now it was merely tested on its self  consistency for several particular processes . in this paper",
    "we have presented the proof of the multi ",
    "regge form in the leading logarithmic approximation for arbitrary quark  gluon inelastic processes in all orders of @xmath0 .",
    "the proof is based on the bootstrap relations required by compatibility of the multi ",
    "regge form of inelastic qcd amplitudes with the @xmath3channel unitarity .",
    "it consists of three steps .",
    "first , we derive an infinite set of the bootstrap relations and demonstrate that fulfillment of these relations secure the reggeized form .",
    "second , we show that all these bootstrap relations are fulfilled if the vertices and trajectories submit to several bootstrap conditions  , and .",
    "this circumstance is extremely nontrivial since an infinite set of the bootstrap relations is reduced to several conditions on the reggeon trajectories and vertices . and",
    "finally , we examine the bootstrap conditions and prove that all of them are fulfilled .    although being simple in principle , necessary calculations were extremely cumbersome and tedious if they performed in the standard approach .",
    "the operator formalism , recently introduced for consideration of elastic amplitudes with gluon exchanges and generalized in this paper for the case of inelastic amplitudes with arbitrary spin and colour exchanges , is very helpful .",
