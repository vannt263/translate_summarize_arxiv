    "almost all of our knowledge of the masses of stellar - mass black holes derives from those in low mass x - ray binaries : the black hole x - ray transients ( bhxrts ; e.g.  @xcite ) . in most of these systems",
    "substantial x - ray activity occurs only during well defined outbursts . between outbursts ,",
    "the emission from the accretion flow fades to the point that the companion star is clearly visible and nearly undisturbed by irradiation ; hence it can be used to derive a dynamical mass for the black hole .",
    "current methodology relies on three key ingredients to determine a mass .",
    "firstly the radial velocity curve of the companion star yields the binary period ( if this is not already known ) , and the companion s projected radial velocity semi - amplitude .",
    "based on these quantities alone , the mass function can be calculated , and this sets an absolute minimum mass for the compact object .",
    "secondly the rotational broadening of the companion star s absorption lines is used to derive the mass ratio .",
    "finally , using photometric observations ( preferably in the ir ) of the ellipsoidal modulation of light from the companion star , coupled with models of this modulation the binary inclination can be determined as a function of assumed mass ratio .",
    "together these quantities yield the mass of the black hole .",
    "in the ideal case there will be no light at all from the accretion flow .",
    "this is never completely the case , however , and we usually must make do with making some assumptions about its effect on the analysis .",
    "typically it is assumed that the spectrum is a featureless continuum and that its contribution is minimized in the ir .",
    "these assumptions are questionable , however . the disk instability model ( dim ; @xcite ) advanced to explain",
    "the transient behavior predicts that the quiescent disk should be very cool , likely cooler than the companion star , and could be optically thick @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that such a disk is virtually required to account for the necessary surface densities , although we argue in section  [ discussionsection ] that this requirement is much weaker than usually stated . under these conditions",
    "we might expect both a significant ir contribution and possibly absorption lines similar to those of a late - type star .",
    "unaccounted for disk emission will bias inclination determinations in the sense that inclinations will be underestimated if disk light is not taken into account .",
    "this effect is quantified by measuring the dilution of the photospheric absorption lines , and is almost always done in the optical .",
    "one must then ask how robust this estimate of the dilution ( the veiling ) is , whether it is biased by absorption lines from the disk , and whether the veiling from a cool disk could be significantly larger in the ir than in the optical .    we know that a disk is present in quiescence .",
    "this is indicated by line profiles and doppler tomography of emission lines ( e.g.@xcite ) and probably by observations of flickering behavior ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the line observations , at least , are related to hotter and optically thin gas which probably co - exists with the cool optically thick material that we are considering , either in a chromospheric layer above the disk , or in low surface density regions @xcite .",
    "the origin of the flickering is less clear . in at least one case , v404  cyg",
    ", it has a line component which appears to be distributed across the disk and driven by x - ray heating @xcite .",
    "these flares exhibit a continuum as well , but this too may be optically thin , and/or associated with the inner disk .",
    "none of these observations inform us about a possible cooler optically thick component of the disk .",
    "we also note that in the quiescent white dwarf system , wz  sge , @xcite have recently identified co and h@xmath2 in _",
    "emission_. the authors argue that this originates in a cool ( 20005000k ) component of the disk .",
    "no equivalent detection has yet been made in quiescent bhxrts , and wz  sge is a unique object that may not be comparable to them , but this should be borne in mind .    in this work",
    ", we will consider what other evidence exists to constrain such cool material .",
    "we will focus on one system as a case - study , the prototypical bhxrt , a062000 ; this work is intended to be an example of the severity of different sources of uncertainty rather than an exhaustive exploration of parameter space .",
    "we will begin by reviewing the relevant system parameters .",
    "we then construct synthetic line profiles , and model spectra , for both the companion star and an optically thick disk with a cool , stellar spectrum .",
    "then we use these to test how sensitive veiling measurements are to uncertainties in the temperature , gravity , and metallicity of the companion , and whether the veiling measurements may be biased by the presence of such disk absorption lines . assuming that the optical veiling estimates are reliable , we next examine the constraints this places upon the quiescent disk",
    ". finally we will examine potentially more stringent constraints from the ir veiling and photometric color .",
    "a062000 is one of the best studied systems with both optical @xcite and ir @xcite veiling estimates as well as recent high - resolution optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the companion star is critical for veiling estimates , but is typically very uncertain in bhxrts .",
    "several of the methods used may be compromised if the disk contamination is significant , and does not vary monotonically with wavelength . in particular , photometric spectral types ( e.g.  k4v , @xcite ) could be significantly biased by contamination of the continuum by another source of light , a point also appreciated by @xcite .",
    "similarly spectrophotometric constraints ( e.g.k3v - k4v ; @xcite ) have the same problem .",
    "constraints based purely upon spectral features are relatively weak for a062000 , with the exception of the recent work by @xcite which we will discuss later .",
    "most have used broad bands rather than sharp features . @xcite",
    "obtained k5k7 , and preferred a dwarf to a giant .",
    "subsequent observations have found molecular bands to be weaker , however , and allow earlier types .",
    "@xcite used k2v , k3v , k4v , and k7v templates and did not explicitly reject any of them .",
    "@xcite preferred k3v or k4v , but could not reject k8v .",
    "earlier spectral types are possible as the only other type considered ( and rejected ) was g8v .",
    "@xcite only used a k3v ",
    "k4v template .",
    "finally @xcite examined the co bandhead in the @xmath3 band and compared to k0v , k3v , k5v , and k7v spectral types .",
    "k3v was preferred , but nearby types could not be ruled out , especially as @xcite challenged the validity of results based purely on the co bandhead because of its sensitivity to surface gravity and metallicity . in summary , then , most studies allow a range of spectral types . a classification",
    "as early as k2v , or perhaps even k1v , can not be definitely rejected .",
    "similarly later types , k4v ",
    "k5v , perhaps as high as k7v ",
    "k8v are not implausible considering only spectroscopic evidence . for this work we will assume k4v , and a temperature of @xmath4k @xcite .",
    "we have belabored this point more than strictly necessary to illustrate the uncertainties present even for a well studied object .",
    "the more recent analysis by @xcite is superior to those discussed above , and yields a somewhat hotter temperature , @xmath5k , corresponding to a spectral type of k3v .",
    "we deliberately do not use this value in our simulations as it is not representative of the quality of measurement available in other systems .",
    "we do keep it in mind as a further indication that typical temperature estimates are uncertain by at least 200k ( and often more ) and will comment further where appropriate .",
    "we also require a surface gravity .",
    "we adopt the predicted value of @xcite of @xmath6 , based on the derived system parameters .",
    "it is consistent with the measured ( spectroscopic ) value of @xmath7 .",
    "the small uncertainty in @xmath8 is dominated by that in the mass ratio of @xcite of @xmath9 .",
    "if the inclination is larger than that derived by @xcite , for example if ir veiling is significant , then the effect on @xmath8 is relatively small . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 it decreases to 4.40 and 4.35 respectively .",
    "finally for the companion we require a metallicity and rotational broadening velocity .",
    "for the metallicity we assume solar , since this is the default assumption for most systems .",
    "@xcite actually find slightly super - solar metallicity ( @xmath12 ) , but this is consistent with solar within uncertainties .",
    "for the rotational broadening we adopt 83kms@xmath13 from @xcite .    to compute disk line profiles we additionally require orbital parameters .",
    "for this purpose we assume @xmath14hrs , @xmath15 , @xmath16m@xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "veiling measurements have been made in both optical and ir for a062000 .",
    "@xcite measured disk contributions of @xmath19%  at h@xmath20  and @xmath21%  at h@xmath22  using a k3k4v template .",
    "@xcite found comparable values ( @xmath23%  and @xmath24%  respectively ) .",
    "@xcite obtained an upper limit on the disk contribution in the ir of @xmath25%  ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is not a robust result , but it is all we currently have . over and above the limitations discussed explicitely later in this work , two major concerns are i ) the data quality is not high enough to be confident that the main co features are securely detected , and ii ) cataclysmic variable star secondaries exhibit anomalously weak co features , possibly due to prior cno processing @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism may operate in bhxrt companion stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , calling into question the usefulness of co bands for veiling measurements .",
    "in general , our analysis technique is to create model composite spectra including a rotationally broadened model atmosphere spectrum for the companion , and either a flat continuum or a model atmosphere for the disk , convolved with a disk line profile . throughout",
    "we aim to reproduce the main characteristics in order to obtain illustrative results ; we are not attempting precise , state - of - the - art modeling of the quiescent spectra .",
    "the synthetic spectrum can be expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath20 is the assumed true disk fraction ( veiling ) , @xmath28 is the input stellar spectrum , and @xmath29 is either unity everywhere , or an input disk spectrum .",
    "having constructed the model spectrum in this way , we then fit it with @xmath30 , where @xmath22 represents the derived veiling and @xmath31 is the spectrum of the adopted template star .",
    "note that in fitting templates to model data we always assume the disk is a flat continuum , following observational practice .",
    "the difference between @xmath20 and @xmath22 then indicates how much the veiling is biased by choice of template , or the presence of disk spectral features .",
    "our treatment is intended to represent the ideal observational case , so we use noise - free normalized spectra . in analyzing actual observations further uncertainties will be introduced by noise and difficulties in normalizing the spectra .",
    "we use two representative wavelength ranges . for the optical we use 59206520 ; this excludes the strong nad lines as these might be contaminated by interstellar absorption in observational data , and also avoids the h@xmath20 and hei 5875  emission lines . in the ir",
    "we use 2.192.31@xmath32 m , to exclude br@xmath33 , but include the first co bandhead ( as used by @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate models appropriate to three instrumental resolutions , represented by gaussians .",
    "the reference case uses @xmath34 , sufficient to resolve the stellar rotational broadening profile .",
    "the second case is @xmath35 , representative of optical studies , and based on the specific example of @xcite .",
    "the third case is @xmath36 , based on the ir veiling determination for a062000  by @xcite .      for convenience",
    "we calculate all model line profiles in the rest frame of the companion star ; in practice observers often shift spectra into this frame and average , so this is appropriate .",
    "we represent the stellar line profile with a rotational broadening profile @xcite assuming linear limb - darkening with a limb - darkening coefficient of 0.73 in the optical , appropriate around 60006500 and 0.31 in the ir @xcite .",
    "this is obviously a crude approximation to a distorted roche - lobe filling star , but is adequate for our purposes .",
    "likewise , linear limb - darkening is imprecise , but commensurate with other approximations made .",
    "disk profiles assume a disk extending from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath37 is taken to be @xmath39 schwarzschild radii , but in practice has negligible effect on the line profiles .",
    "we expect @xmath40 to lie between the circularization radius , the minimum radius at which new material is likely to be added to the disk , and the tidal truncation radius , the approximate maximum size .",
    "the former may be more likely for a quiescent disk , but the latter produces narrower profiles , and hence is more likely to contaminate the stellar spectrum .",
    "for a062000 , these assumptions yield @xmath41kms@xmath13 for the tidally truncated case and @xmath42kms@xmath13 for a disk extending out to the circularization radius ; we adopt the narrower tidally truncated profile . for simplicity",
    "we assume a disk with uniform temperature and surface gravity and hence no variation in the emergent spectrum with location .",
    "this is a gross simplification but probably no worse an approximation than the one we make by using stellar atmosphere spectra in place of more realistic disk atmospheres .",
    "the temperature distribution in quiescent disks is in any case expected to be rather flatter than in outbursting systems ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that since we are calculating line profiles in the companion star s rest frame , the disk appears to move with velocity semi - amplitude @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the velocity semi - amplitudes of the compact object and companion star respectively ) .",
    "we show model composite line profiles in fig .",
    "[ profilefig ] , assuming equal fluxes from star and disk , and lines of the same equivalent width . examining the high resolution case first , it can be seen that the much higher rotational broadening in the disk has the effect of completely separating the two components , even though the local emergent lines were assumed to be identical .",
    "the effect is amplified even more when the orbital average is considered , as this further smooths the disk profile out .",
    "this separation is well preserved for a typical optical resolution ( @xmath46 ) , and the two components are sufficiently decoupled that the apparent depth of the optical absorption line is little affected .",
    "the disk line is effectively broadened by so much that it appears almost as a smooth continuum on the scale of the stellar features . at even lower resolutions the separation becomes less clear ,",
    "there are obviously still two components , but they merge more and one might expect a more significant contamination . nonetheless ,",
    "if one could isolate a single profile at high enough signal - to - noise , the stellar component could be separated and measured reasonably reliably . in practice",
    "this is not what is done of course , and the broad disk components would prove more difficult to separate when multiple blended lines are present and when one must rely on statistical measures , such as @xmath47 fitting , to estimate the veiling .",
    "we next convolve the above line profiles with model atmosphere spectra .",
    "we construct these using atomic and molecular line data and a grid of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) atlas9 model atmospheres obtained from the kurucz website .",
    "we interpolate within these models for a given set of @xmath48 , @xmath8 , and @xmath49 $ ] and then compute model spectra using the lte stellar synthesis code , moog @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ atmospherefig ] shows examples of stellar and disk spectral models calculated in this way for the same assumed temperature and gravity , to illustrate the gross differences between the two spectra , and reinforce the point made in the previous section .",
    "a serious problem with the veiling estimates arises from the uncertainty in the spectral type .",
    "these estimates are extremely sensitive to a mismatch between the template and the data , as is illustrated for gs2000 + 25 by @xcite , for example , where disk contributions of 035%  are inferred for k1m0 templates . in theory , the best fitting template will indicate the true spectral type , but the correct choice may not be obvious from @xmath47 values alone , as is the case for the gs2000 + 25 .    to further explore this problem",
    "we perform a series of simulations in which we fit the @xmath4k , @xmath50 template plus featureless disk to composite models containing stellar spectra of a range of temperatures plus a featureless disk . in each case",
    ", we adjust the assumed ( true ) veiling , @xmath20 , until the derived veiling , @xmath22 , matches that observed . fig .",
    "[ temperrorfig ] shows the assumed veiling required for a range of stellar temperatures roughly corresponding to the temperature uncertainty in a062000 .",
    "large errors are clearly possible : if the true temperature is just 100k smaller than that of the template then the optical veiling is underestimated by a factor of 2 , and if it is 100k larger then no veiling is required at all .",
    "indeed @xcite derived zero red veiling in a062000 for their preferred @xmath51k solution .",
    "if the measured veiling is larger then the fractional error is less significant , but will still usually exceed the statistical error , and will probably always dominate the uncertainty in veiling measurements .",
    "similar effects occur in the ir , where the quoted upper limit of @xcite could be consistent with a true veiling of up to 50%  for severe template mismatch .",
    "in both the optical and ir , if the temperature of the template is lower than that of the star , the veiling will be overestimated because cooler templates generally have stronger lines ( averaged over the wavelength region being fitted ) . in the case of a062000 , there are indications that that may be the case , as discussed above , so existing veiling estimates are probably useful as upper limits . in most systems , however , we do not have such a precise temperature and can not make such an assumption .      as noted above",
    ", the uncertainty in gravity for a062000 is not large .",
    "nonetheless , the co bands in particular are expected to be sensitive to gravity , so even a small uncertainty might be significant . furthermore , the gravity of a062000 , and most bhxrt companions , is lower than that of a main sequence star , and hence lower than typical templates .",
    "for example @xcite gives @xmath52 for a k4v star .",
    "as above , we take a @xmath4k , @xmath50 template plus featureless disk model and use it to fit synthetic optical spectra comprising a star of the same temperature but different gravities , plus a 6%  featureless disk contribution .",
    "an uncertainty in @xmath8 of 0.04 has negligible effect , and allowing a range of @xmath53 still yields derived veilings of @xmath54% , within the statistical uncertainties of @xcite .",
    "the most extreme case is when we use a main - sequence @xmath55 template and fit to a @xmath56 spectrum .",
    "even then a derived veiling of 6%  corresponds to a true veiling of 2% , close to the edge of the quoted error range .",
    "therefore uncertainties in gravity , and mismatch with a main - sequence template , are not the dominant source of error in the optical .    in spite of the gravity sensitivity of the co bandheads ,",
    "there is also negligible effect in the ir .",
    "using a @xmath57 template , we a mismatch in gravity only raises the upper limit from 27%  to 29%  for gravities of @xmath58 . fitting a @xmath59 template to a model spectrum with gravity of @xmath60 only raises the limit to 30% .",
    "note that the bias is in the opposite sense to that found in the optical .",
    "another difficulty is that the line strengths will also be a function of the metallicity .",
    "a mismatch between the metallicities of the template and companion could also introduce an error in the veiling measurement ; a low metallicity companion will have weaker lines , and hence appear more heavily veiled than it actually is .    the metallicity of the secondaries of bhxrts is not well constrained by observations .",
    "@xcite examine metallicities of nearby k dwarfs and find a spread in @xmath61}$ ] of approximately @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the distribution peaks at -0.2 . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite derive @xmath61}=+0.14\\pm0.20 $ ] for a062000 , at the high end of the range . given this range , unless the template star is deliberately selected by metallicity",
    ", a mismatch is not just possible , but likely .",
    "the template used by @xcite , hd16160 , has @xmath61}=-0.03\\pm0.14 $ ] @xcite , so the mismatch is small , but not negligible ( @xmath64 ) . in the case of the ir measurement of @xcite , however , the preferred template ( hd42606 ) does not have a published metallicity , so a larger mismatch is possible .    to test the sensitivity to metallicity",
    "we adopt a model spectrum of @xmath4k , @xmath57 , solar metallicity , and a variable disk contribution .",
    "the template we fit to the model is assumed to have the same temperature and gravity , but metallicities of -0.3 , -0.6 , and -0.9 , in accord with the range found by @xcite . with these combinations",
    "we find that to reproduce an observed optical veiling of 6%  requires true veilings of 20% , 32% , and 46% . in the ir",
    "the sensitivity to metallicity is also large ; an upper limit on the veiling of 27%permits true veilings of up to 41% , 54% , and 67%  for template metallicities of -0.3 , -0.6 , and -0.9 respectively .",
    "thus if the template has lower metallicity than the target , then the veiling could have been substantially underestimated .",
    "returning to a062000 , @xcite obtain a metallicity of @xmath49=0.14\\pm0.20 $ ] , whereas the template used by @xcite has a metallicity of @xmath49 = -0.03\\pm0.14 $ ] .",
    "on the one hand the difference between them is not statistically significant , but on the other it could be large enough to bias the veiling measurement substantially , by a factor of two or more .",
    "mismatch between template and target metallicities can thus be a major contributor to the uncertainty in veiling measurements .",
    "we finally proceed to test the robustness of veiling estimates if the disk spectrum is not featureless .",
    "we consider an ideal case , where the spectra are averaged over a full binary orbit in the rest frame of the companion .",
    "we use the modeled companion star spectrum ( @xmath65k , @xmath57 ) as the template for the stellar component so that no bias is introduced by template mismatch .",
    "values of @xmath66 are shown in fig .",
    "[ veilfig ] for various assumed disk temperatures and resolutions ; we have used @xmath67 for these tests .",
    "we consider first the optical case . for moderately high resolutions ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) ,",
    "the error in the veiling is modest , and would usually be within the statistical uncertainties in the veiling measurement ( which are typically large ) .",
    "the error is larger for a cool disk because the spectral features tend to be deeper . at low resolutions ,",
    "the problem becomes much more severe . in this case , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ profilefig ] , the disk and stellar line profiles are no longer well resolved , and it becomes hard for the fitting algorithm to distinguish between them , even with a template perfectly matched to the star . for low disk temperatures ,",
    "the stronger lines actually mean that adding a disk contribution makes the overall lines appear stronger rather than weaker , and one would derive a negative veiling ( clipped here to zero ) .    in the ir the situation is less favorable , at least if the primary diagnostics are co bands .",
    "data are typically obtained at lower resolution than in the optical ( as in @xcite ) , and even if higher resolutions are used , the intrinsic width of the co bands limits the discrimination possible between disk and stellar profiles .",
    "the low resolution case is thus comparable to the same resolution in the optical , but there is less benefit to high resolutions , unless the study focuses only on metallic features . as noted earlier , contamination of the co bands by the disk might be _ expected _ in quiescent bhxrts , as co emission is seen in the quiescent cataclysmic variable wz  sge @xcite , although it is not clear that the cases are comparable . if contamination is by emission features then the veiling will tend to be overestimated .",
    "we thus conclude that provided veiling studies are done at intermediate resolution or better , the bias on the veiling is not the dominant source of error in the optical , even if the disk has strong absorption lines . at low resolutions , such as commonly used in the ir , the measurement could be severely compromised .",
    "this will also apply ( irrespective of resolution ) if the features used are not narrow , e.g.  co or tio molecular bands .",
    "it is usually argued ( e.g.  @xcite ) that since the veiling is measured to be lower in the red than in the blue , then the ir veiling must be even lower . the implicit assumption being made here",
    ", however , is that the veiling varies monotonically with wavelength .",
    "there is no requirement that this be the case ; multiple components may contribute to the disk spectral energy distribution .",
    "the optical veiling ( and uv spectrum ) may well be dominated by a stream impact point or overflow @xcite , and appears to be relatively blue .",
    "the stream - impact point certainly does appear as a bright source of emission line light in doppler tomograms @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is observed that rapid flaring exhibits a rather redder spectrum , comparable to the color of the companion star ( @xcite ) ; this could represent the optically thin disk component .",
    "optically thick disk material could also be present .",
    "this material is predicted to be very cool ( @xmath703000k ) and will not contribute much flux at optical wavelengths . given the large projected surface area of the disk ( several times that of the companion ) , an extended but cool component might , however , produce a significant contribution in the ir , even if it is undetectable in the optical .",
    "one can then imagine a disk with two components , a hot component dominating optical and uv wavelengths and a cool component dominating infrared wavelengths .",
    "such a picture is consistent with theoretical expectations , but has the unhappy consequence that the total veiling may well be minimized in the red , precisely where most measurements are made !    we can attempt to quantify the possible contribution of the cool disk material to the ir by considering optically thick disks with a range of temperatures and projected areas . as above , we assume a uniform disk temperature and parameterize the area as the covering factor of a tidally truncated disk . for a062000",
    "such a maximal disk has a projected area @xmath71 times that of the companion star , assuming @xmath72 @xcite , whereas a disk only extending to the circularization radius still subtends an area @xmath73 times that of the companion .",
    "we can then estimate the maximum covering factor which is consistent with the observed optical veiling as a function of temperature .",
    "for this purpose we now use the most robust estimate , a red veiling of @xmath23%  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the relative contributions from the companion and disk as a function of temperature by using surface brightness from nextgen model atmosphere calculations @xcite . this of course explicitly assumes the disk is optically thick ,",
    "so these constraints will not apply if the disk is optically thin .",
    "we find that disks of a temperature comparable or greater than the companion are highly constrained by the optical veiling if this is reliable ( see fig .",
    "[ coverfig ] ) ; this constraint would become even tighter if one allows for the presence of a blue veiling component as well .",
    "what this means is that the quiescent disk must either be much cooler than the companion ( @xmath74k ) or mostly optically thin ( with perhaps small clumps of optically thick material ) .",
    "note that since the circularization radius effectively limits the minimum size of the disk , one can not explain this away entirely with a small disk ; the minimum covering factor possible in this way is about 0.4 .",
    "as the disk temperature is allowed to drop , however , the constraint relaxes , and for theoretically motivated temperatures ( @xmath703000k ; e.g.  @xcite ) a more respectable covering fraction is possible .",
    "such a disk can actually contribute strongly in the @xmath3 band while having negligible effect in the optical .",
    "it would of course veil the features of the companion star , so @xmath3 band veiling estimates could still constrain its presence , but as we have seen the existing ir estimate @xcite is potentially compromised by even a small mismatch with the template temperature or metallicity , or by disk spectral features . the upper limit",
    "derived , 27%  at 2-@xmath75 , however , does not strongly constrain a cool disk ( fig .",
    "[ coverfig ] ) , especially when we consider that the upper limit may not be very robust .",
    "an additional constraint comes in the form of the consistency of inclination determinations from the simultaneous @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath3 lightcurves ( @xcite ; gelino 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "these authors find inclinations derived from individual bands are all consistent with the combined fits to within uncertainties ( @xmath78 ) . if veiling were present with colors different to those of the star , then different bands would experience different veilings and hence discrepant inclinations would be derived .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ coverfig ] the constraint this places on the disk covering factor with a k2v companion star . assuming k4v results in slightly higher limits .",
    "unfortunately even these observations only limit the covering factor , and hence veiling , to a similar precision as claimed from spectroscopic veiling .",
    "a final possible constraint would come from the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "indeed one of the arguments made by @xcite for negligible ir contamination was that the photometric sed was consistent with the spectroscopic spectral type constraints .",
    "this is less robust than the inclination constraint , however , as it is very sensitive to the assumed spectral classification of the companion star , and hence results in weaker limits than the inclination constraint does .",
    "these have not been shown .",
    "we conclude that an extensive , cool , optically thick disk component in a062000  can not confidently be rejected based on any existing observational evidence .",
    "there is no reason such a disk should not be present , and it could have as large a contribution in the @xmath3 band as veiling measurements allow , 25% , or even more .",
    "we know of no evidence to support the assertion that the @xmath3 band contamination is as low as a few percent .",
    "a cool , optically thick disk component might be expected in quiescent bhxrts as it has long been argued that an entirely optically thin disk is inconsistent with the dim ( see discussions by @xcite and @xcite ) . the argument is made that an optically thin disk requires extremely low surface densities , for example @xcite estimated @xmath79g@xmath80 .",
    "in contrast , the dim operates at critical surface densities of order 100g@xmath80 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . even if one believes that the dim is not correct , @xcite estimate that during a typical outburst of a062000  a few @xmath81 g are accreted , corresponding to an _ average _ surface density pre - outburst of at least 20g@xmath80 .",
    "while it would appear that most of the quiescent disk mass must then be in the form of optically thick material , there is an inconsistency here . @xcite",
    "were considering relatively high temperature material ( by quiescent standards ) at temperatures above 6000k , whereas disk models are now working with temperatures that drop to 20003000k in quiescence . at these temperatures opacities",
    "are expected to be lower ( e.g.  @xcite ) , so higher surface densities could remain optically thin under these conditions , and this issue requires further examination .    as a crude test we considered the expected optical depth , based on rosseland mean opacities taken from @xcite of a range of uniform slabs of temperature 20003000k , surface density 20100g@xmath80 , and thickness 14@xmath82 cm , corresponding approximately to @xmath83 values of 0.010.02 for the outer disk of a typical quiescent bhxrt such as a062000 . at low temperatures ( @xmath84k ) this essentially depends only on surface density , with optical depths 0.21.2 likely . at higher temperatures ( @xmath85k )",
    "volume density becomes important , and a larger range of optical depths from 0.13.8 are found for the parameters described above .",
    "we conclude that based on current knowledge of such disks optically thick regions might or might not be present ; they do not appear to be inescapable as has sometimes been claimed , but should still be considered a possibility , and observational constraints such as discussed here are needed to rule it out .",
    "as has long been appreciated , an optically thick disk is not inconsistent with the presence of disk emission lines , as these likely originate from a chromosphere above the disk ; indeed this chromosphere could account for most or all of the optical emission . alternatively it may be that there are optically thin patches in the disk in between optically thick clumps ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". such a picture would be appealing to explain the mirror eclipses seen in quiescent dwarf novae , which imply that at least 20%  of the disk ( by radius ) must be optically thin in the continuum ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . note that if the disk mass is clumpy then this will further increase the likelihood of clumps being optically thick .",
    "any optically thick material must be cool . for it to be stable on the cool branch of the disk instability",
    "requires @xmath86k .",
    "unless it consists of a few very dispersed clumps , or is indeed optically thin , the optical veiling further constrains the temperature to @xmath87k .",
    "this is consistent with typical theoretical temperatures @xmath88k ( e.g.@xcite ) . in this regime , as we have seen , the observational constraints are extremely weak , and an extensive optically thick component contributing a significant fraction of the light in the @xmath3 band is possible",
    ".    it would therefore be an interesting constraint if the disk contribution at @xmath3 is only a few percent . as shown in fig .",
    "[ coverfig ] , this would require the area of the optically thick fraction of the disk to be small , implying most of the disk is optically thin .",
    "a significant optically thick covering factor ( more than 10% ) is only consistent with 5%  contamination for @xmath89k .",
    "it is unlikely that quiescent disk material can be this cool , as there will always be some heating by the companion star , the stream impact , and the central x - ray source .",
    "one argument against significant ir contamination is that optical ellipsoidal modulations are distorted and variable , but the ir modulations are much cleaner .",
    "this argument is not conclusive , however .",
    "it is likely that the optical veiling originates from the stream impact and/or overflow .",
    "this material is highly non - axisymmetric , and variable .",
    "the optically thick material , however , is likely to be in an axisymmetric and probably non - variable disk , and so is likely to only contribute a steady source of light that does not distort the ellipsoidal variations .",
    "we have examined the observational constraints upon the presence of a cool , optically thick component to the accretion disks of quiescent bhxrts .",
    "such a component is theoretically plausible , but has not yet been detected .",
    "we have shown that constraints from veiling of the stellar photospheric spectrum are not very robust , as the veiling derived is very sensitive to a mismatch between temperatures and/or metallicities of the companion star and template , and to a lesser extent to a surface gravity mismatch .",
    "if the disk spectrum exhibits similar spectral features to the star , for example co bands in emission or absorption , then this can further bias veiling estimates .",
    "the current situation in the prototypical system a062000 is that reasonably robust optical veiling measurements now exist , in the sense that the veiling , temperature , gravity , and metallicity are all determined simultaneously by high resolution spectroscopy @xcite , but that the ir remains poorly constrained .",
    "the red veiling tightly constrains the temperature and or covering factor of a warm disk , requiring either @xmath90k , or a very low covering factor ( @xmath91% ) of optically thick material .",
    "cooler disks , as expected theoretically , are unconstrained by the optical measurement .",
    "the ir veiling measurements made so far are sensitive to the uncertainties summarized above so are not robust . a more robust approach yielding similar constraints to",
    "the ir veiling is the relative amplitudes of ellipsoidal variations @xcite , but these still allow contamination up to @xmath92% .    thus we conclude that no current measurements constrain the @xmath3 band contribution from the accretion disk to better than about 25%  in a062000 , and consequently that significant dilution of ir ellipsoidal modulations remains possible . in particular , the assumption that the ir contamination is only a few percent is not yet supported by compelling evidence .",
    "this issue has important implications for black hole mass determinations .",
    "@xcite , for example commented that increasing the @xmath3 band disk veiling to 50%  would increase the derived inclination to @xmath11 .",
    "the derived black hole mass would then drop from 11m@xmath17 to below 5m@xmath17 !",
    "this is an extreme case , clearly a milder and more plausible ir veiling could still have substantial impact on the derived black hole mass .",
    "finally we note that if the @xmath3 band disk contamination can be observationally constrained to be only a few percent then this will place very tight constraints indeed upon the temperature and/or covering factor of optically thick material , providing a test of quiescent disk models .",
