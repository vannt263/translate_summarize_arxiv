    "after the electron - pair annihilation , the evolution of the photon occupation number of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons in the cosmic plasma is suitably described by the kompaneets equation @xcite .",
    "this approximation of the generalized kinetic equation includes , in its generalized form , compton scattering , that conserves the photon number , and all the possible photon emission or absorption processes , such as ( at least ) double compton and bremsstrahlung .",
    "compton and double compton processes depend linearly on the baryon density in the universe , while the bremsstrahlung term is proportional to the square of the baryon density . after the recombination epoch ,",

    "it should be replaced by the complete comptonization formula .",
    "at very low frequencies , the free - free distortion becomes self - absorbed .",

    "the validity of the assumption @xmath72 for the range of wavelengths considered in this work has been numerically checked for the suppression model at @xmath1 = 100 including the details of ionization and thermal histories , but it is certainly satisfied by other cutoff values and reionization histories , since they exhibit not so different clumping factors and free - free rates .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath73 at @xmath74 = 0.01 cm and , obviously , a much greater value @xmath75 at @xmath74 = 10 m .",
    "finally , the free - free parameter @xmath76 turns out to be :    @xmath77      the matter density contrast depends on the cosmological model and parameters . in particular , the nature of dark matter particles affects the power spectrum of density perturbations at small scales , with implications for the clumping factor .    the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "standard cosmological model forecasts the existence of primordial cold and collisionless particles with negligible small velocity dispersion at the epoch of radiation - matter equality and a derived matter power spectrum supporting small scale structure formation .",
    "the dark matter velocity distribution suppresses fluctuations below its free streaming scale , proportional to the mean velocities - mass ratio . in this framework ,",
    "galaxy formation is a hierarchical process , resulting in the typical _ bottom up _",
    "scenario where denser clumps give rise to satellite galaxies @xcite , leading to the well known over - prediction of these galaxies with respect to those observed in the milky way .    in this context , the idea of warm dark matter ( wdm ) particles was proposed as a possible solution of the small scales cdm and cuspy halo problems , the latter related to the density profile in virialized dm halos .",
    "wdm candidates have intrinsic thermal velocities , so exhibit larger velocity dispersions , compared to cdm particles , and present characteristic free streaming scales , which contribute to determine clustering properties , such that small scale structures formation is suppressed .",
    "typical particle masses are in the range of the kev scale , which is intermediate between cold and hot dm masses , @xmath78kev @xcite , being @xmath79gev and @xmath80 few ev .",
    "sterile neutrinos or gravitinos are possible candidates for wdm .",
    "the suppression of fluctuations due do @xmath81wdm particles on scales smaller than their free - streaming scale , corresponding to a cut - off of the total matter power at large @xmath0 , slows down the growth of structure @xcite and can be described by means of the transfer function for different cut - off values .    for a given cosmological model , the transfer function describes the effect induced by the free - streaming length on the matter distribution such :    @xmath82^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    while the formation of the first generation of stars is affected by the adopted cosmological model , large scale structure distributions are independent of the model @xcite .",
    "thus , in this analysis we assumed a cdm model with a cut - off @xmath1 in the range ( 20,1175 ) which approximately mimics the power spectrum drop for wdm models with different particle properties .",
    "the epoch of reionization , driven by the formation of the first luminous objects at @xmath83 , as probed by the discovery of galaxies and quasars at @xmath84 and by the gunn - peterson test @xcite , is one of the main tool to unravel the initial stages of structure formation . during this phase ,",
    "ionizing radiation was transferred to the inhomogeneous cosmic gas in several distinct steps .",
    "the physical properties of the astrophysical sources responsible for this process largely affect the evolution of the medium in the reionization era @xcite .",
    "in particular , during the hydrogen reionization phase it is possible to identify an initial pre - overlap stage and an intermediate and quick enough overlap period which ends up in the reionization process .",
    "the same ionizing sources should induce the first ionization of helium , while the second one should be delayed to smaller redshift , being therefore in principle accessible to observations ( through ly-@xmath85 absorption lines ) .",
    "the intergalactic ionizing radiation field is typically characterized by the so called escape fraction , the amount of ionizing radiation supplied by stars and quasars , which depends on the radiative efficiency of these sources , their emission spectrum , and their density distribution . in principle , it is possible to distinguish two contributions , one coming from galactic gas and one from galactic dust , both of them able to absorb and re - emit electromagnetic radiation at lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "hence , the global escape fraction is strictly related to galaxy mass and redshift , so it should be tracked within the densest regions in the universe , where the transfer of ionizing radiation is more efficient .",
    "usually , reionization era is associate to the thomson optical depth , @xmath86 , an integrated cosmological parameter which conveys information on the physical conditions of the universe due to recent events , opening an observational window on the physics of ancient cosmic objects .",
    "furthermore , it is clearly linked to later non linear evolution .    in order to investigate the effects triggered by the reionization process and amplified by a non negligible igm density contrast on cmb free - free spectral distortions , we focalized our analysis on three well determined universe s reionization models .",
    "two of them , namely suppression ( s ) @xcite and filtering ( f ) @xcite , are astrophysical motivated , the other is a phenomenological , late double peaked ( l ) history @xcite , considered here for comparison ( see @xcite and references therein for further details about these models and their parameters ) .",
    "the s and f reionization scenarios can be tuned to match various kinds of astronomical observations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their optical depths are then well determined : @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "the l scenario can be modeled by means of free quantities describing the electron ionization fraction and electron temperature .",
    "we set its main parameters in order to have @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we exploited also the reionization history produced with the standard camb assuming the cosmological parameters derived by the _ planck _",
    "collaboration @xcite , presented with the recent first release of cosmological data .",
    "the clumping factor , related to the density of the igm , affects the escape of radiation from an inhomogeneous medium @xcite . typically , assuming an uniform ionized medium",
    ", the clumping quantifies the number of spatially averaged recombinations in the igm relative to the ones in the cosmic gas , per time and volume unit @xcite .",
    "commonly , the clumping is supposed to be roughly spatially uniform providing a ionized volume much greater than the clumping scale .",
    "this parameter also has an impact on the gas recombination timescale , such that the higher is the clumping value , the faster is the recombination process .",
    "free - free emission from the ionized medium , with the interplay of cosmic radiative feedback of the sources responsible for universe reionization , can produce a potentially remarkable distortion in the cmb spectrum , particularly at long wavelengths .",
    "@xcite estimated lower limits of this effect for the filtering and the suppression model explicitly assuming a diffuse , averaged density , i.e. neglecting clumping , but suggesting the relevance of including it in the computation .    in order to derive the variance of the matter power spectrum we run camb , the code for the anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "it allows in fact a precise computation of the power spectrum of all the relevant components of the cosmic fluid at the desired grid of redshifts .",
    "the variance of the baryonic matter can be then calculated integrating over a suitable wavenumber interval the corresponding power spectrum :    @xmath90    clearly , the most accurate choice is to perform this computation for the interesting set of cosmological parameters for the considered models . on the other hand",
    ", this is highly demanding in terms of computational time ( and , possibly , solution storage ) for the exploration of a wide set of cosmological models .    in this section",
    "we provide a set of suitable approximations able to represent @xmath91 at an accuracy level of a few per cent for the models considered here , exploiting also changes in two parameters crucial in this context , the amplitude and the small scale cut - off of perturbations , and some other cosmological models .",
    "the found formulas can be also adopted as guidelines to derive approximations valid for other models .    in the context of this work",
    ", this analysis represents an intermediate step for the evaluation of the free - free distortion , but , more in general , the found results can be useful to improve the treatment of clumping factor in other cosmological applications , as , for example , the study of alternative reionization scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we start from the cosmological parameters adopted in the suppression reionization history ( see @xcite ) .",
    "with reference to camb notation , they are :    @xmath92     + the camb code allows us to save a file of the evaluated matter power spectrum in @xmath93/mpc units , normalized for baryons , cold dark matter particles and massive neutrinos , and the transfer function in the synchronous gauge , given a unit primordial curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales , for each requested redshift and for each parameter that represents the cut - off in the estimate of the variance , the transfer @xmath0 maximum .",
    "we selected a redshift interval between @xmath94 and @xmath95 with an increasing step of @xmath96 , and an initial @xmath97 ( hereafter @xmath1 ) , to be then able to truncate the integral at the desired wavenumber .",

    "<S> the density contrast of the universe , parametrized in terms of the matter power spectrum and its variance , can amplify the signal of the free - free process in the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the damping of fluctuations on scales smaller than the dm particle free streaming scale corresponds to a suppression of the total matter power spectrum on large wave numbers @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the time evolution of the variance of the matter power spectrum for various cosmological models and parameters by numerically computing the power spectrum with a modified version of the boltzmann code camb , for different values of the cut - off parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> suitable analytical approximations of the numerical results are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we then characterize the cmb free - free spectral distortion accounting for the amplification effect coming from clumping factor . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the clumpiness , associated to the density contrast of the intergalactic medium , increases at decreasing redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out for selected astrophysical and phenomenological cosmological reionization histories , for which we evaluate the impact of the clumping factor on the free - free distortion and discuss the wavelength dependence of the predicted signal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we address a comparison with other classes of unavoidable cmb spectral distortions and future observational perspectives . while comptonization from reionization is dominant at high frequencies , the free - free signal predicted in the considered models contributes to the distortion at a level of few ( few tens ) per cent at frequencies below @xmath2ghz ( @xmath3ghz ) and represents the main signature below @xmath4ghz . the cosmological signal from the hi 21-cm background </S>",
    "<S> is found to prevail over the free - free distortion in a restricted , model dependent frequency window between @xmath5 and @xmath6ghz .    </S>",
