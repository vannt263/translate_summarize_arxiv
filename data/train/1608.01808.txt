    "many primitive bodies exist in the vast regions of the solar system beyond jupiter , of which the largest population is the trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) .",
    "the details of the orbital distribution of the tnos preserve information about the evolution of the solar system @xcite . following the evolution of the planetesimal disk , most tnos were left in low inclination",
    "orbits @xcite .",
    "even scattered disk objects have typical inclinations less than 30@xmath6 - 40@xmath6 @xcite . however , the discovery of 2008 kv@xmath0 @xcite revealed the first member of a new population : a retrograde tno .",
    "dynamical simulations of 2008 kv@xmath0 demonstrate that it has a very long lifetime ( a few gyr ) @xcite , suggesting that a large population with similar orbits may exist in this region .",
    "centaurs are minor planets with semi - major axes between those of jupiter and neptune , and whose orbits are planet - crossing .",
    "they constitute a link between the short - period jupiter - family comets and the reservoir of icy bodies in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "centaur orbits are typically unstable , with lifetimes of @xmath7myr @xcite .",
    "centaurs are generally assumed to originate as scattered disk objects which interact with neptune , causing a change in semi - major axis . however , high inclination centaurs seem not to originate from the scattered disk ( whose inclination distribution seems to be too narrow to supply high inclination objects such as 2008 kv@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite also find that the kuiper belt is an extremely unlikely source of the retrograde centaur .",
    "some researchers suggest that the oort cloud could be the source of such high inclination centaurs @xcite , but given the small number of high inclination objects in the minor planet center ( mpc ) catalogs , the origin of the high inclination population in the outer solar system will remain uncertain until more such objects are detected and their orbital distribution is understood .",
    "the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system 1 survey ( pan - starrs 1 , hereafter ps1 ) is the first wide - field optical system ( @xmath8 steradians ) using a dedicated large aperture ( 1.8 m ) telescope to carry out multi - epoch , multi - color observations with careful calibration @xcite .",
    "the ps1 outer solar system ( oss ) key project has completed an initial search for slow - moving objects , resulting in hundreds of candidates , of which @xmath9 are known @xcite . in the catalog of initial results , we identified a distant object with an inclination greater than @xmath10 , i.e. retrograde tno .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a second retrograde tno and analyze its dynamical evolution .",
    "in addition , after selecting known objects from the mpc database which satisfy the orbital criteria of perpendicular orbits , with the aim of identifying similar objects , we found a population of high - inclination objects that occupy the same orbital plane but which orbit in both senses ( retrograde and prograde ) .",
    "the ps1 survey observed the entire sky north of declination @xmath11 using a sloan - like filter system ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , ps1 observed within @xmath17 of the plane of the ecliptic using the @xmath18-band ( limiting magnitude @xmath19 , correspond to tno @xmath20 ) , which spans the wavelength range of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . upon searching the ps1 for outer solar system objects",
    ", we identified an unusual object , which we nicknamed `` niku '' , with a retrograde , nearly polar orbit .",
    "niku has been observed 22 times by ps1 at two different oppositions . to test and improve the orbit determination of niku , we obtained follow - up observations with the 1-m lulin observatory telescope ( lot ) in taiwan .",
    "in addition , we gathered archival decam and cfht observations using ssois ( solar system object image search ] ) @xcite .",
    "the astrometry and photometry of all observations were calibrated against the ps1 catalog .",
    "we determined the orbit of niku , based on observations spanning four oppositions , using the orbit fitting code of @xcite .",
    "the resulting uncertainties in the heliocentric orbital elements are all small .",
    "the elements are inclination @xmath21 , longitude of ascending node @xmath22 , semi - major axis @xmath23au , eccentricity @xmath24 ; and argument of pericenter @xmath25",
    ". pericenter passage will occur at @xmath26 .",
    "the current barycentric distance of niku is @xmath27 , well inside the orbit of neptune .",
    "we independently verified the orbit determination using the openorb package of @xcite ; the results are the same within uncertainty .",
    "we note that the orbital elements of niku are very similar to those of the first retrograde tno , 2008 kv@xmath0 .",
    "their semi - major axes are both beyond neptune s orbit ; eccentricities are in the range @xmath28 and the inclinations of both are larger than @xmath29    after we submitted the astrometry of niku to the mpc , niku was linked with 2011 kt@xmath30 , an object with a short observational arc ( 8 days ) the initial orbit of 2011 kt@xmath30 was identified as a prograde centaur ( mpec 2011-l09 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the combination of the mpc data for 2011 kt@xmath30 and our observations somewhat improves the orbit determination",
    ". however , our observations of niku alone are good enough to perform a reliable dynamical analysis . considering the internal consistency of the ps1 reference frame , we use the orbit based on the data measured with the ps1 star catalog for all further analyses .",
    "to explore the evolution of niku s orbit in the planet - crossing region , we performed numerical simulations using the mercury package @xcite .",
    "we used the covariance matrix generated by the orbit fitting code of @xcite and generated 1,000 clones drawn from within 3-sigma of the best - fit orbit .",
    "we included the four giant planets in the simulations , and integrated the 1,000 clones forward for 1gyr using a 180-day time step .",
    "the majority of the clones were stable for at least 0.1gyr , with the stable half - life being @xmath32 myr , with a long tail having lifetimes up to 1gyr .",
    "the 1,000 clones initially had semi - major axes in the range 35.70au@xmath3335.74au . during the @xmath34 gyr",
    "simulation , the clones experience orbital evolution , leading to the distribution of _ final _ semi - major axes illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ]",
    ". twenty percent of clones with a final orbit @xmath3 au stably survive beyond 1gyr ; thirty percent with @xmath35 au survive beyond 1gyr ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this 1gyr lifetime is approximately two orders of magnitude larger than a typical centaur s lifetime @xcite .",
    "all survivors exhibited similar orbital evolution : ( 1 ) their tisserand parameter with respect to neptune is similar ( @xmath36 ) , ( 2 ) most of the clones always have perihelion distances larger than 10au , where they remain beyond the gravitational influence of saturn and jupiter , ( 3 ) the integration of 1,000 clones of 2008 kv@xmath0 , with the same parameters as above , shows a nearly identical result .",
    "the highest density of survivors in the ( @xmath37 , @xmath38)-plane illustrated in figure [ fig : fig1 ] matches the location of niku and 2008 kv@xmath0 .",
    "this may hint at the existence of a large population with similar origin .",
    "we also checked niku for the existence of resonances with neptune , i.e. 5:4 ( 34.9au ) and 4:3 ( 36.4au ) : no libration of resonant arguments was observed .    to understand the relation between niku and other known objects , we performed the following two analyses .",
    "first , we select known objects from the mpc catalogue , to compare their dynamical evolution with that of niku .",
    "following the criteria ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) in @xcite and the perihelion evolution we observed in our niku clones , we use looser constraints with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and opposition @xmath42 to obtain the sample list for understanding niku s relation to other similarly inclined objects ( table [ tab : tab1 ] ) . if the high inclination reservoir / population mentioned in @xcite and @xcite",
    "does indeed exist , then we may find some traces from known objects .",
    "for the objects in table [ tab : tab1 ] with @xmath3 , we observe that there is a clustering in the ascending node ( @xmath43 ) of the objects , regardless of whether the orbit is prograde or retrograde ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the ascending node of the prograde orbits ranges between @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; the ascending node of the retrograde orbit ranges between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "these two ranges are planar opposite , which means the orbits of these six objects occupy an approximately common plane .",
    "note that the angular momenta of the prograde and retrograde orbits are antialigned .",
    "if we change the selection criteria to include all objects with @xmath48 and @xmath4 , then we no longer see any obvious clustering in @xmath43 ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "second , we performed additional numerical simulations for objects in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the integrations use the same parameters as described above .",
    "we have verified that the clones of 2010 wg@xmath49 , 2002 xu@xmath50 and 2008 kv@xmath0 could all survive within 1000au for 1gyr , with a survival rate of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the clones of objects with smaller @xmath54 and @xmath37 ( 2007 bp@xmath55 and 2001 mm@xmath56 ) have a much smaller probability ( @xmath57 ) of surviving until the end of the 1gyr integration .",
    "we note that the precession directions of the prograde and retrograde orbits are _ opposite_. in our integrations , the common plane disappears on a short time scale ( a few myr ) .",
    "it is essential to determine the likelihood that the apparent clustering in the longitude of ascending node occurs by chance .",
    "here we discuss possible reasons for , and origins of , this clustering .      because of the small number of samples ( only six members ) we can not completely reject the hypothesis that the occupation of a common plane is due simply to coincidence . using monte carlo simulations , we randomly generate six objects with an isotropic @xmath43-distribution ( @xmath58 ) and an isotropic @xmath38-distribution ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "then , these objects are separated into two subgroups , one with @xmath60 and one with @xmath61 .",
    "finally , two criteria were defined to decide whether they are in a common plane : ( 1 ) the @xmath43 of subgroup with @xmath62 are within @xmath63 of average-@xmath43 ( @xmath64 ) of this subgroup , and the @xmath43 of another subgroup ( @xmath65 ) are within @xmath66 , ( 2 ) the object with @xmath62 has a prograde orbit ( @xmath67 ) and the object with @xmath65 has a retrograde orbit ( @xmath68 ) . in other words , assuming @xmath64 is the average-@xmath43 in the range @xmath69 , then check object if ( @xmath70 ) or ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "after a million iterations , the probability of getting six objects in a common plane is @xmath72 , or about 3.8-sigma .",
    "furthermore , the explanation that the common plane is merely a coincidence becomes even more implausible if we consider ( a ) other orbital parameters and ( b ) the dynamical behavior of the objects .",
    "alternatively , one might consider that a distant and inclined primordial disk could be a feeding objects into this high - inclination population .",
    "however , any clustering of their ascending nodes would likely be erased within a few myr by the orbital precession discussed in section [ sec : analysis ] . at this stage ,",
    "the small number of known high inclination objects makes it impossible to attempt to reconstruct the orbital distribution of such a putative distant population .",
    "most of the large surveys which search for moving objects , focus primarily on the region close to the plane of the ecliptic , typically within @xmath73 .",
    "the lack of a high ecliptic latitude survey leads to an obvious bias against high inclination objects . except for cfeps and ossos ,",
    "most of the survey data have not had their detection efficiencies thoroughly characterized , though ps1 will be characterized in the near future .",
    "a systematic analysis of the expected population is therefore currently impossible .",
    "the only _ high latitude _ survey which has been characterized is the cfeps high ecliptic latitude extension @xcite ( hereafter , cfeps - hele ) .",
    "the cfeps - hele survey detected at least two high inclination objects , namely 2009 ms@xmath49 and 2008 kv@xmath0 .",
    "we note that 2009 ms@xmath49 does _ not _ occupy the common plane discussed above , but 2008 kv@xmath0 _ does _ orbit within this plane .",
    "if a survey region only concentrates on a particular ra range , the bias of @xmath43 and discovered position will be shown in the sky .",
    "based on the survey regions of ps1 and cfeps - hele , we find no obvious bias that can explain the clustering of @xmath43 ( see figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) .    the current version of the pipeline used to generate the catalog of moving object candidates from the ps1 oss uses a novel heliocentric transformation method to efficiently identify and link observations across multiple nights .",
    "this method , to be fully described in holman & payne ( 2016c _ in prep . _ ) , requires a heliocentric distance be assumed for the objects under investigation .",
    "the assumed distance is then iterated to find the best _ approximate _ heliocentric distance , before the linked observations are handed off to have a detailed orbital fit generated by the _ orbfit _ routine of @xcite .",
    "crucially , a _ minimum _ assumed distance of @xmath74 was used in this initial pipeline run , as a means to ensure rapid progress .",
    "however it is likely that this biased the initial pipeline search _ against _ finding centaurs and other objects with heliocentric distances significantly less than @xmath74 . as such",
    ", we expect that an imminent update to the ps1 oss , which expand the parameter - space that is searched to well inside @xmath74 should reveal additional centaur - like objects , and may well provide additional high inclination candidates .",
    "the combination of well characterized ps1 and cfeps - hele data sets will provide an extraordinary means to search for a population at high ecliptic latitudes .      as discussed in section [ sec : analysis ] and section [ subs : coin ] , we expect that orbital precession will quickly erase the occupation of a common plane . hence , another perturber or mechanism may be required to maintain this occupation . considering the hypotheses from literature , those postulating external forces , like the hypothetical planet nine @xcite , solar companion @xcite , and a dwarf planet in scattered disk @xcite all seem to be problematic , as they have great difficulty in affecting the planet - crossing region , due to the small perturbations they exert at such great separations ( small tidal parameter , @xmath75 ) .",
    "our mock integrations using the same parameters in section [ sec : analysis ] , but inserting the proposed planet nine @xcite , is _ not _ able to maintain the common orbital planet of the test particles over any significant time scale , i.e. the orbital precession still erases the @xmath43 clustering quickly .",
    "we note that the simulations in @xcite , provide a source of high-@xmath38 and large - a tnos with a clustered distribution of @xmath43 .",
    "their cluster has an `` x '' shape composed of two common planes , and we stress that _ neither _ of which are coincident with the plane in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "moreover , even if the objects which occupy our common place did somehow originate from this `` x '' shape , the @xmath43 clustering would still be expected to vanish due to precession , and hence some mechanism to confine the orbits would be required .",
    "the high-@xmath38 centaurs and tnos may originate in the oort cloud @xcite or some other undetected reservoir @xcite , based on the small change of inclination @xcite . as mentioned in section [ subs : p9 ] , irrespective of origin , the observed clustering in @xmath43 still requires a mechanism to maintain the common plane in the face of divergent orbital precession .",
    "the existence of such a mechanism has not been established .",
    "the detailed exploration of such an unknown mechanism is beyond the scope of this letter , but as indicated in section  [ subs : p9 ] , we established through numerical integrations that the putative planet nine was unable to explain the orbital confinement .",
    "in addition , we also attempted more extreme alternative scenarios , consisting of integrations that include a synthetic high - inclination dwarf planet of a few earth masses whose orbit crosses the giant planet region .",
    "none of these attempts succeeded in anchoring the @xmath43 of the test particles .",
    "moreover , adding a planet into planet - crossing region has a very high chance of disrupting the orbital structure of the kuiper belt and remaining outer solar system . a more detailed set of investigations is required to understand whether this common orbital plane is dynamically robust and long - lived , and if so , what mechanisms contribute to its longevity .",
    "additionally , it remains to be seen whether the observed common orbital plane survives further observational scrutiny .",
    "well - characterized observations of objects in this plane will also contribute to an understanding of overall observational bias . a deeper and wider survey , such as lsst ,",
    "may provide a means to detect additional high-@xmath38 objects in this common plane , and/or an undetected dwarf planet that is sculpting their orbits .",
    "we report the discovery by the pan - starrs-1 outer solar system survey of the second retrograde tno .",
    "our numerical integrations of niku show that it s dynamical evolution is very similar to that of 2008 kv42 .",
    "this result may hint at the existence of a large population of similar origin .",
    "we have also uncovered the possible occupation of a common plane by the known objects with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the mechanism causing and maintaining this common plane is still unknown .",
    "the detection of additional high inclination objects in future surveys , such as ps2 or lsst , will provide additional clues as to the dynamical origin of this population .",
