    "for stars of low to intermediate masses ( @xmath9 ) , the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) evolutionary stage is characterized by significant mass loss ( @xmath10 to @xmath11  yr@xmath5 ) through cool , low - velocity ( @xmath1210  ) winds . over the course of roughly @xmath13 years , the material ejected from the atmospheres of such stars forms extensive circumstellar envelopes , up to a parsec or more in diameter ( e.g. , habing 1996 ) . indeed , agb stars are one of the primary means by which processed material is recycled back into the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ". thus knowledge of the mass - loss history of these stars is key not only to understanding the evolution and ultimate fate of low - to - intermediate - mass stars ( including their transition to the planetary nebula stage ) , but also for constraining the chemical evolution of the ism and the factors that govern its small - scale structure . in binary systems ,",
    "the material shed by agb stars also may have an important influence on the evolution of type ia supernovae ejecta ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2004 ; deng et al . 2004 ) .    to date",
    ", most studies aimed at probing the material shed during the agb stage have focused on trace species ( e.g. , co ; dust grains ; h@xmath14o , sio , & oh masers ) due to their ready detectability at radio and infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , habing 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "however , hydrogen should be by far the dominant constituent of the mass expelled from agb stars . of particular interest",
    "is the _ atomic _ hydrogen component , since unlike molecular species ,  is not destroyed by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "this implies that observations of circumstellar  have the potential to probe significantly larger distances from agb stars than studies of other envelope tracers ( @xmath15  cm ; e.g. , villaver et al .",
    "2002 ; le  bertre & grard 2004 ) .",
    "atmospheric models predict that for the coolest giants ( @xmath162500  k ) , hydrogen in the stellar atmosphere will be predominantly molecular , while for @xmath172500  k , hydrogen will be mainly atomic ( glassgold & huggins 1983 ) . as hydrogen",
    "is shed via an outflowing wind , a number of additional factors may modify its state , including the formation of h@xmath14 on grains and the dissociation of h@xmath14 through chromospheric emission , shocks , a hot companion , or the interstellar radiation field . while the relative importance of these various effects remains largely unknown",
    ", models predict that some fraction of the hydrogen in agb circumstellar envelopes should be atomic , and consequently , should be observable via the  21-cm line ( clegg et al .",
    "1983 ; glassgold & huggins 1983 ; villaver et al .",
    "furthermore ,  has been detected in emission and/or absorption toward several planetary nebulae ( rodrguez & moran 1982 ; altschuler et al .",

    "1989,1990 ; gussie & taylor 1995 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "2000,2002 ) ; the detected material was presumably expelled by the stars during their agb stage , although the details of this process are still poorly understood ( e.g. , rodrguez et al .",
    "2002 ) .    together",
    "the above factors make direct measurements of  radiation of considerable interest for determining the dominant form of hydrogen in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars and for helping to constrain the physical processes governing their evolution .",
    "in addition ,  measurements have the potential to supply independent assessments of mass - loss rates , terminal velocities of the stellar wind , and the sizes , structures , and total masses of the circumstellar envelopes .    despite the abundant motivations for measuring the hydrogen component in the circumstellar envelopes of agb stars",
    ", such observations are challenging in practice .",
    "even for the nearest agb stars , the  signal is expected to be quite weak , and most often is coincident both in position and frequency with strong galactic foreground and background emission along the line - of - sight . indeed , initial efforts to detect associated with evolved stars had very limited success . until recently , the combined result of these studies ( zuckerman et al .",
    "1980 ; knapp & bowers 1983 ; schneider et al . 1987",
    "; bowers & knapp 1987,1988 ; hawkins & proctor 1992 ) was only one 21-cm line detection of a genuine agb star ( @xmath18  ceti = mira ; bowers & knapp 1988 ) , along with the detection of one red supergiant ( betelgeuse@xmath19  ori ; bowers & knapp 1987 ) .",
    "these results have often been interpreted as implying that the material lost from agb stars must be primarily molecular ( e.g. , zuckerman et al .",
    "1980 ; knapp & bowers 1983 ) , although in many cases , the derived  upper limits are not sufficiently sensitive to rule out atomic hydrogen as an important constituent of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this situation has changed dramatically in the past five years .",
    "using the upgraded nanay  radio telescope , t. le  bertre , e. grard , and coworkers have recently reported detections of roughly two dozen agb and related stars .",
    "le  bertre & grard ( 2001 ) first reported a detection of  absorption toward the carbon star irc  + 10216 ( but see  [ irc10216 ] ) .",
    "this team subsequently reported  emission detections of the semi - regular variable stars rs  cnc , ep  aqr , and x  her ( grard & le  bertre 2003 ; le  bertre & grard 2004 ; gardan et al .",
    "2006 ) and the carbon - rich semi - regular variable y  cvn ( le  bertre & grard 2004 ) .",
    "most recently , they published the results of a more extensive survey featuring detections of a variety of types of agb stars and planetary nebulae ( grard & le  bertre 2006 ) .",
    "these latest results are tantalizing , as they suggest that at least part of the material in the circumstellar envelopes of many evolved stars is atomic , and that it is feasible to use  21-cm emission as a diagnostic probe of the late stages of stellar evolution . indeed",
    ", the large observed  extents of the detected envelopes ( up to @xmath122  pc ) confirms that  probes different regions of the envelope than co or other molecular tracers , and thus can trace mass - loss over very large time - scales  up to @xmath20  yr .",
    "that the observed line profile shapes are very different from the rectangular profiles expected for symmetric , optically - thin , constant velocity outflows also suggests that the outflows from the stars are slowing down with time and that multiple ( in some cases highly asymmetric ) mass - loss episodes have occurred .",
    "however , a more complete interpretation of these discoveries requires better spatial information than can be provided by the @xmath21(e - w)@xmath22(n - s ) beam of the nanay telescope .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the nanay  spectra depends on the decomposition of the line profile in the presence of strong foreground and background emission .",
    "since much of this contaminating emission is spatially extended , it should be resolved out with an interferometer , implying that aperture synthesis measurements can provide valuable complementary constraints on the  line parameters , and on the existence of circumstellar  components with a range of spatial scales .",
    "motivated by this , we have recently used the very large array ( vla ) to undertake a pilot imaging study of five nearby agb stars .",
    "the goals of our study included expanding the sample of agb stars with sensitive  observations , as well as better constraining the sizes and spatial distributions of the  envelopes of agb stars previously detected with the nanay  telescope .      for our pilot  survey of agb stars with the vla , we did not attempt to study an unbiased sample of objects , but instead selected targets that we judged to have a good probability of detection .",
    "our sample included three stars for which single - dish detections had been reported at the time our study began ( irc+10216 , rs  cnc , and ep  aqr ; see above ) , together with two additional well - known agb stars : r  cas and r  aqr .",
    "these latter two stars were selected as being relatively nearby and well - placed in the sky for scheduling purposes .",
    "in addition , both have radial velocities offset from the peak of the galactic interstellar emission along the line - of - sight ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , and neither has any strong neighboring 20-cm continuum sources ( condon et al . 1998 ) whose sidelobes might complicate the detection of weak , extended stellar  signals . an additional motivation for targeting r",
    "aqr is that it is part of a symbiotic binary system , with the orbit of the hot companion lying within the cool giant s circumstellar envelope ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "1983 ; hollis et al .",
    "it has been suggested that the primary source of the  emission detected from the weakly symbiotic agb star @xmath18  ceti could be h@xmath14 photodissociated by its hot companion ( bowers & knapp 1988 ; grard & le  bertre 2003 ) , hence it is of interest to explore whether  is also associated with other symbiotics .",

    "our observations were carried out using the vla on 2004 july 1 & 28 .",
    "the array was used in its most compact ( d ) configuration ( 0.035 - 1.0  km baselines ) in order to yield maximum sensitivity to emission on scales of up to 15@xmath57 . in total , five stars , five phase calibrators , and two primary flux calibrators were observed .",

    "total on - source integration times for each target star ranged from 75 - 97 minutes .",
    "some further details of the observations are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the autocorrelator was configured in 2ac mode , with a 0.78  mhz bandpass . after on - line hanning smoothing , this yielded 127 channels with 6.1  khz ( @xmath121.3  ) separation in each of two independent polarizations ( right and left circular ) .    for the observations of all target stars and phase calibrators ,",
    "the bandpass was centered at zero velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "the primary flux calibrators ( 3c48=0137 + 331 and 3c286=1331 + 305 ) each were observed twice ; first with the bandpasses centered at @xmath58 , and then at @xmath59 , in order to avoid contamination of the bandpass from galactic line emission near @xmath60 .",
    "the two spectra were then averaged for calibration purposes .",
    "the galactic line emission along the lines - of - sight to our phase calibrators and target stars is sufficiently ubiquitous that is most likely filled the beams of the vla antennas and caused some increase in the overall system temperature , t@xmath61 .",
    "because our flux calibrators were observed at velocities free from galactic emission , the net result will be a systematic underestimate of the flux densities of our phase calibrators and program stars . to estimate the severity of this effect",
    ", we examined the  survey spectra of hartmann & burton ( 1997 ) toward the direction of each of our targets .",
    "since the dwingeloo telescope used by hartmann & burton is the same diameter as the vla antennas ( 25 m ) , the mean brightness temperature of the emission in these spectra over the velocity range of our vla spectral band can be directly compared with the nominal @xmath62 values for the vla antennas over the same band .",
    "we estimate the most significant increase in @xmath62 toward the direction of r  cas , where our flux scale may be systematically low by @xmath1210% . for the other four program stars the effect is likely @xmath635% .",
    "because the effects are modest compared with various systematic uncertainties , we have not attempted to correct the flux densities quoted in this paper for this effect .",
    "our data were reduced using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software .",
    "first a `` pseudocontinuum '' data set was produced by vector averaging the inner three - quarters of the spectral bandpass .",
    "the pseudocontinuum data were used to identify and excise interference , malfunctioning antennas , and other bad data , and to calibrate the antenna gains .",
    "absolute flux levels were established using observations of standard vla flux calibrators ( 3c48 and 3c286 ) , and antenna phases were calibrated by using observations of bright point sources interspersed with the observations of each star ( table  2 ) .",
    "the bandpasses of the spectral line data were calibrated using the primary flux calibrators .",
    "the data for two of our targets ( rs  cnc and irc+10216 ) were obtained during the daytime and exhibited some contamination at short spacings , most likely from solar interference ( the stars were 33@xmath64 and 44@xmath64 from the sun , respectively ) .",
    "this short - spacing contamination resulted in a low - frequency ripple pattern ( spatial period @xmath65 ) in all channels of our deconvolved images .",
    "since this pattern was spatially fixed with a roughly constant amplitude from channel to channel ( @xmath122  mjy  beam@xmath5 ) , we were able to effectively remove it in the visibility plane , together with the continuum in the fields , using the aips task uvlin ( cornwell et al .",
    "1992 ; see also below ) .",
    "the spectral - line data for each of the target stars were imaged using the standard clean deconvolution algorithm within aips . in all cases",
    "we used a cell size of 10@xmath66 and imaged a @xmath67 region centered on the star . to maximize sensitivity to diffuse , extended emission , natural weighting ( robust parameter @xmath68=+5 )",
    "was used in all cases to make an initial image of the line data , yielding synthesized beams of @xmath69-@xmath70 . for each target",
    ", deconvolved images were made first from visibility data with the continuum retained in order to identify channels free of line emission .",
    "subsequently , uvlin was used to fit a zeroth or first - order polynomial to the real and imaginary components of each visibility in the line - free channels of the @xmath71-@xmath72 data ( see table  4 ) , and to subtract the continuum before a second , continuum - subtracted data cube was produced .",
    "use of this method of continuum subtraction results in a biased noise distribution in the deconvolved data cube , in the sense that the channels used to determine the continuum level have lower rms noise ( in our case by @xmath1210% ) compared with those excluded from the fit .",
    "we therefore made additional test cubes for each star where different ranges of channels were selected for continuum fitting in order to ensure that this channel - dependent noise did not affect our ability to identify emission features .",
    "to further improve our dynamic range and sensitivity to extended emission , additional image cubes were computed using gaussian tapering , yielding a synthesized beam with fwhm @xmath73 ( see table  4 ) .",
    "initially , all images were deconvolved without using any clean boxes ( but see below ) . even with the use of tapering , the effect of missing short spacings is evident in some of our images . when relevant , we comment further in   [ results ] on the implications of this for our analysis of the large - scale emission from individual targets .",
    "the limited @xmath71-@xmath72 coverage of our observations also led to a second type of artifact in our data . in all of our initial data cubes ( both tapered and untapered ) , we found that most channels exhibited a pattern of emission in the form of broad ( several arcminute scale ) diagonal stripes and/or `` checkerboard '' patterns .",
    "these patterns typically had mean amplitudes of @xmath121 - 3  mjy beam@xmath5 in the tapered image cubes , although both the structure and the intensity varied from channel to channel within each image cube , and roughly 10% of the channels interspersed throughout each cube were completely free of this effect .",
    "the affected channels were not limited to frequencies with the brightest galactic interstellar emission , although the effect was noticeably stronger in these channels . except for the few channels with the strongest galactic signals , we found this structured noise could be eliminated if data from the shorter spacings ( below @xmath120.3k@xmath74 ) were excluded during imaging .",
    "detection of this unwanted emission only on short spacings implies its source is likely to be sidelobe contamination of the primary beam by large - scale galactic emission distributed across the sky that is poorly sampled by the array .    in order to ensure that the above noise pattern did not produce spurious signals",
    "that might be mistaken for circumstellar emission , we made at least two additional image cubes for each star : one excluding spacings below 0.3k@xmath74 , and another using data from all spacings , but with clean boxes placed around any potential circumstellar emission features .",
    "we found that the use of clean boxes also significantly reduced the amplitude of the unwanted large - scale background pattern .",
    "we regard candidate circumstellar  emission features as potentially real only if they were found to be statistically significant in _ both _ of these additional data cubes .",
    "however , we performed most of our subsequent analysis on data cubes incorporating the full range of array spacings .",
    "table  4 summarizes the properties of the final images used for the analysis described in this paper .",
    "continuum images of each of our stellar fields were obtained by first computing a vector average of the visibilities from all channels that were judged to be free of line emission ( see table  4 ) .",
    "this averaged @xmath71-@xmath72 data set was then imaged using the aips taks imagr with a robust weighting parameter of @xmath68=+1 . in the case of the rs  cnc and irc+10216 fields , additional images with @xmath71-@xmath72 restrictions",
    "were imposed in order to suppress the short - spacing interference described above .",
    "only one of our target stars , the symbiotic binary r  aqr , was detected in the 1.4  ghz ( 21-cm ) continuum ; those data are discussed further in  [ raqr ] .",
    "none of the other four stars in our sample have been detected previously at 1.4  ghz , and none show detetable 1.4  ghz counterparts on the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the radio photosphere model of reid & menten ( 1997 ) , which predicts that the 1.4  ghz emission from the isolated agb stars in our sample would be roughly 50 - 80 times weaker than our detection limit ( see also knapp et al .",

    "@xmath83  , a compact emission feature ( hereafter the `` compact component '' ) is present , coincident with the position of rs  cnc .",
    "these channels show an additional , elongated emission component ( hereafter the `` extended component '' ) , extending from the compact feature to roughly @xmath84 northwest of the star s position , along a position angle of @xmath85 .",
    "this extended emission is most prevalent between @xmath86=3.9 - 7.7  .",
    "based on the autocorrelation spectra obtained by each vla antenna , we find that the systemic velocity of rs  cnc is coincident with modest galactic foreground / background emission along the line - of - sight . near the systemic velocity of the star , this emission has a brightness temperature of a few k ( see also grard & le  bertre 2003 ) . most of this foreground / background appears to be resolved out in our aperture synthesis images .",
    "therefore the coincidence of the compact emission component in both position and velocity with rs  cnc strongly suggests a physical association with the star .",
    "the compact nature of the central component and the lack of any features of similar strength at other positions in the map or in adjacent channels also lend credence to an association between the  emission and rs  cnc .    to further quantify the significance and uniqueness of the detected emission , an automated matched - filter technique was used to search our data cube for signals ( see uson & matthews 2003 ) .",
    "this search was performed on the continuum - subtracted , naturally - weighted , untapered data cube within a @xmath87 region , over the entire usable velocity range ( @xmath88@xmath89  ; i.e. , the inner 77% of the band ) .",
    "in essence , signals above a signal - to - noise threshold were identified by looping through the data , convolving each spectrum through the designated portion of the data cube with gaussian kernels of width 2 - 10 channels ( 2.6 - 13  ) .",
    "the most significant signal was found centered at @xmath90  and at the phase center of the data cube , corresponding to both the position and systemic velocity of rs  cnc .",
    "the maximum signal - to - noise of this feature ( 10@xmath91 ) occurred with a convolution width of six channels ( @xmath128  ) . outside of the channels suspected of containing emission from rs  cnc ( i.e. , outside the velocity range @xmath92  ) , the next strongest feature ( 9@xmath91 ) occurred in the channel corresponding to the peak of the galactic  signal in the autocorrelation spectra ( near @xmath93  ) .",
    "in this case the signal is not located at the position of rs  cnc .",
    "the portion of the data cube searched contained @xmath20 independent beams , hence the probability that the peak signal from a random  cloud along the line - of - sight would occur at both the position and velocity of rs  cnc is roughly 1 in @xmath13 .",
    "these results therefore strongly suggest that we have detected  emission physically associated with the envelope of rs  cnc .",
    "figure  [ fig : rscncmom0 ] shows an  total intensity image of the emission surrounding rs  cnc , made by summing the emission in channels spanning the velocity range @xmath83  . to increase signal - to - noise , only pixels whose flux density had an absolute value of @xmath94 after smoothing the data by a factor of three in velocity",

    "however , an important difference is that gardan et al . find the _ broader _ velocity component of the x  her profile to be more spatially extended and linked with a possible outflow along a preferred direction ; for rs  cnc we find the fwhm velocity width of the extended emission component to be narrower than that of the compact component ( see below)although both components can be traced over comparable velocity ranges .",
    "an alternative explanation for the slight skewing of the line profile may be the effect of ram pressure as the star moves through the ambient ism .    from the  profile in figure  [ fig : rscncglobal ] we measure a peak flux density of @xmath104  jy and an integrated  flux of @xmath105=0.44@xmath106  jy  .",

    "grard & le  bertre ( 2003 ) estimated an  mass of @xmath111 associated with such an extended component , which would nearly double the  content of the envelope .",
    "grard & le  bertre ( 2003 ) suggested that the narrow component of their decomposed  spectrum of rs  cnc must arise from an emission region unresolved by the 4@xmath57(e - w ) nanay  beam .",
    "the velocity interval over which we detect emission near rs  cnc is similar to the velocity spread seen in the narrow , rectangular component of grard & le  bertre s spectrum ( @xmath112  @xmath113  based on their figure  3 ) , and indeed , roughly one half of the emission detected with the vla lies well within a projected radius around rs  cnc of @xmath114 .",
    "the additional extended component we see in our data to the northwest is most prevalent over the velocity interval 3.9 - 7.7  , implying that it is not the material responsible for the second broad , extended emission component reported by grard & le  bertre ( 2003 ) . that we do not see any evidence for this broad component in the vla data is consistent with the suggestion of grard & le  bertre that it arises from emission extended on scales of at least several arcminutes .",
    "altough the velocity resolution of our vla data are too coarse ( @xmath121.3  ) for very precise linewidth determinations , we can roughly characterize the  line shape of rs  cnc as comprising a broad ( fwhm@xmath128  ) , flat component linked with the compact emission feature , together with a narrower component ( fwhm@xmath123  ) linked to the extended emission .",
    "the broader component has a peak flux density comparable to the rectangular component reported by grard & le  bertre ( 2003 ) , although the emission we measure has a slightly broader velocity extent .",
    "the narrower line component seen in our data appears to be missing from the composite nanay  profile , although it may be blended with the additional broad , spatially extended emission component measured by those authors .",

    "we can estimate a mass - loss rate for rs  cnc using the  parameters derived above . for simplicity , we assume a spherical envelope with a constant mass - loss rate and constant outflow speed .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the actual situation is likely more complex ( see also gardan et al .",
    "2006 ) . moreover , because the relationship between the compact and the extended emission components is uncertain ( see below ) , we consider only the compact component for this calculation .",
    "adopting an mass of 0.75@xmath120 , an outflow speed of 4  ( hwhm of the  line from the compact component ) and a diameter of @xmath1  cm ( the geometric mean of the major and minor axes ) , this yields @xmath121  yr@xmath5 after correction for he .",

    "this predicts a component of motion toward the southwest ( lower right of figure  [ fig : rscncmom0 ] ) , inconsistent with the interpretation of the extended emission as material swept back by motion through the ism .",
    "one final possibility we can not yet discount is that the extended  emission to the northwest is not associated with rs  cnc , but results from a chance superposition of an unrelated cloud along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , the correspondance between the radial velocity of this material and the compact  component centered on the star makes this possibility seem unlikely .",

    "le  bertre & grard ( 2004 ) observed an  emission profile toward ep  aqr that they decomposed into three components , centered at lsr velocities of @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath191  , respectively , and having velocity widths @xmath19313.0 , 2.6 and 1.6  , respectively .",
    "our vla data reveal emission that could be related to the latter two components , but no evidence of the emission responsible for the broadest line component .",
    "le  bertre & grard ( 2004 ) noted that this broad component appears to arise from a region extended to as much as 10@xmath57 from the star , and our vla data would have poor sensitivity to emission on these scales .",
    "le  bertre & grard ( 2004 ) suggested that the narrowest component seen in their data ( centered at @xmath194  ) arises from an emission region close to the star that is unresolved by their 4@xmath57(e - w ) beam .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : epaqrcmaps ] , our vla data do reveal weak ( @xmath124 - 5@xmath91 ) emission features in channels centered at @xmath195 & @xmath196  , respectively , and lying within one - half synthesized beamwidth from the position of ep  aqr .",
    "these two channels also show additional , brighter emission clumps to the northwest , which become more prominent at higher velocities . summing all of this",
    "emission yields a flux density at these velocities comparable to the peak value of 24  mjy reported by le  bertre & grard ( see figure  [ fig : epaqrprofile ] ) .",
    "in addition , channels corresponding to velocities in the range @xmath197  @xmath198  all show multiple @xmath81 emission clumps that can be traced over two or more consecutive channels .",
    "the combined signal from these clumps likely contributes to the intermediate - width emission component that le  bertre & grard reported centered at @xmath199  .",
    "le  bertre & grard suggested that the material giving rise to their intermediate - width component must be concentrated 4@xmath57 - 8@xmath57 northwest of ep  aqr , and this is roughly consistent the brightest emission region we detect with the vla , centered @xmath1210@xmath57 northwest of ep  aqr s position ( see figure  [ fig : epaqrmom0 ] ) .",
    "as in the case of irc+10216 (   [ irc10216 ] ) , we are faced with some difficulty in assessing whether any or all of the emission detected in our vla observations could be associated with the circumstellar envelope of our target .",
    "compared with the case of irc+10126 , the peak brightness temperature of the galactic  emission along the line - of - sight to ep  aqr is roughly twice as strong ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) .",
    "however , the emission is quite weak at the velocity of ep  aqr ( @xmath2001  k ; le  bertre & grard 2004 ) , and the star is located well below the galactic plane ( @xmath201@xmath202 ) , minimizing the probability for line - of - sight contamination . nonetheless , as with irc+10216 , we specifically targeted ep  aqr because of a previous report of  emission near the systemic velocity of the star , hence this velocity coincidence alone is not enough to discount the possibility of foreground / background contamination .    within a 15@xmath57 radius around ep  aqr , the bulk of the emission we detect near the stellar systemic velocity",
    "is contained within six fairly compact clumps , @xmath203-@xmath179 across .",
    "all of these clumps are detected at @xmath81 in at least one channel and are traceable over two or more consecutive channels .",
    "we summarize some properties of these clumps in table  6 . if they lie at the distance of the star , the  masses of these features are @xmath204-@xmath205 .",
    "the sum of the emission in the clumps with velocities consistent with the ep  aqr envelope yields @xmath206 . a global ( spatially integrated ) profile derived by summing this emission",

    "moreover , the presence of a strong negative feature near the center of our map suggests we are missing flux on short - spacings , so we can not rule out the existence of a more diffuse , underlying envelope .",
    "the velocities of the emission clumps visible in figure  [ fig : epaqrmom0 ] ( see table  6 ) are all consistent with velocity range over which co emission has been detected in the envelope of ep  aqr , and the range of  velocities corresponds with the velocity spread of the `` red wing '' of its two - component co profile ( nakashima 2006 ) . however , whereas the global co line profiles of ep  aqr as seen in various transitions all appear symmetric about @xmath102 ( e.g. , knapp et al . 1998 ; nakashima 2006 ) , all of the  clumps we have detected are redward of the systemic velocity .",
    "this makes it difficult to unambiguously establish a physical relationship between the detected clumps and ep  aqr s envelope .",
    "moreover , we find an additional  clump in our data cube with similar properties , but at a significantly higher velocity ( @xmath210  ; see table  6 ) ; material at this velocity is very unlikely to be associated with ep  aqr s circumstellar envelope .    clumps with sizes and masses similar to the ones we find in the direction of ep  aqr were also seen in the vla  study of the red giant @xmath128  ori by bowers & knapp ( 1987 ; see also knapp & bowers 1988 ) . in the case of @xmath128  ori , the velocities of 9 of 13 the detected  clumps are consistent with the velocity spread of co emission in the envelope of @xmath128  ori measured by knapp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but the velocities are preferentially concentrated redward of the stellar systemic velocity . in addition , numerous small co clouds were subsequnetly discovered in this direction ( knapp & bowers 1988 ) , leading bowers & knapp to conclude that the  clouds they detected are unlikely to have a circumstellar origin .",
    "assuming the clumps we have detected toward ep  aqr are in equilibrium and that they are approximately spherical with uniform densities , the masses required for them to be gravitationally bound can be estimated based on the virial theorem :    @xmath211    where @xmath212 is the radius of the cloud in parsecs , @xmath213 is the fwhm velocity width of the cloud in , and the gravitational constant in these units is @xmath214=1/232 . we have tabulated angular size estimates for the clumps in table  6 .",
    "if we assume the clouds lie at the distance of ep  aqr and take @xmath213 as the fwhm of the  line profiles of the clumps , the masses estimated using equation  1 range from @xmath215 up to 564@xmath216 .",
    "these values are @xmath125 orders of magnitude higher than the inferred  masses ( table  6 ) .",
    "clearly if the clumps are located at the distance of ep  aqr they can not be self - gravitating . indeed , even if these clumps reside far out in the galactic halo ( @xmath217100  kpc ) , their  masses would still be more than an order of magnitude smaller than their virial masses .",
    "this suggests that either these clouds are not in equilibrium ( and thus are transient features ) or else that the clouds are pressure confined by a medium that has been resolved out by our interferometric measurements ( see also knapp & bowers 1988 ) .",

    "the morphology of this extended filament suggests that a component of the mass - loss from rs  cnc was highly asymmetric . from the  data we derive a recent mass - loss rate of @xmath297  yr@xmath5 , comparable to previous estimates based on co observations .    for the mira variable r  cas we have detected weak emission centered at the systemic velocity of the star .",
    "the morphology of the emission is consistent with a partial shell - like structure with a radius @xmath298 .",
    "this structure overlaps with the dust shell previously detected by young et al .",
    "( 1993a , b ) , and we estimate for it an  mass of @xmath299 .",
    "galactic contamination at the position and velocity of r  cas is low , suggesting a good probability that the  emission we have detected is associated with its circumstellar envelope .    toward two other targets ( the carbon star irc+10216 and the semi - regular variable ep  aqr ) we have also detected multiple arcminute - scale  emission features at velocities consistent with their respective circumstellar envelopes , but spatially offset from the position of the stars .",
    "however , in these cases , we are unable to determine unambiguously whether the emission arises from material within the circumstellar envelope or , instead , from the chance superposition of  clouds along the line - of - sight . in each case , we have discussed evidence for and against both interpretations .",
    "toward irc+10216 we find arc - like  emission structures at projected distances of @xmath6 to the northwest of the star .",
    "the large separation between the  emission and the position of the star are consistent with the advanced evolutionary status of irc+10216 and the prediction that  will be formed from an initially molecular wind via photodissociation and/or the sweeping up of interstellar material as the wind expands .",
    "however , it is unclear if the highly asymmetric geometry and the complex velocity structure of the emission we have detected are consistent with a circumstellar origin .    we were unable to confirm the detection of  in absorption against the cosmic background in the envelope of irc+10216 as previously reported by le  bertre & grard ( 2001 ) .",
    "our vla images reveal that at least part of the apparent absorption signature seen by le  bertre & grard may have arisen from emission that contaminated the off - beam measurements used in their position - switched ( on@xmath24off ) observations .    in the case of ep  aqr",
    ", we have detected six arcminute - scale clumps of  emission within a projected radius of @xmath300 around the star .",
    "all of the clumps lie redward of the stellar systemic velocity , although their velocities are consistent with the `` red wing '' of the circumstellar envelope as seen in co emission .",
    "while it is tempting to posit that these clumps may be part of a more diffuse underlying envelope reported by le  bertre & grard ( 2004 ) , the presence of an additional  clump in our data that is significantly redshifted relative to the star raises the possibility that we are instead sampling random interstellar clouds along the line - of - sight .",
    "we find , however , that regardless of the assumed distance for these clumps , their virial masses exceed their  masses by over an order of magnitude , suggesting that either these are transient features or that they are embedded in a more diffuse medium to which the vla is insensitive .",
    "in the case of both ep  aqr and irc+10216 , combining our vla observations with single - dish mapping may help to remove the ambiguities in associating the detected  emission with the respective circumstellar envelopes .",
    "in addition , a future compact `` e '' configuration of the vla would be well - suited to studies of this kind .",
    "we detected our fifth target , r  aqr ( a symbiotic star with a hot companion ) , in the 1.4  ghz continuum with a flux density @xmath301mjy .",
    "none of the other four stars in our sample showed detectable continuum emission .",
    "r  aqr is a well - known radio source , and its continuum emission likely arises primarily from free - free emission from an ionized circumbinary envelope .",
    "however , we did not detect any neutral hydrogen associated with r  aqr .",
