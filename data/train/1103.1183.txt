    "theories unifying gravity with other interactions suggest the possibility of spatial and temporal variation of fundamental physical constants , such as the fine structure constant , @xmath2 , and the electron to proton mass ratio , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the search for such variations has received considerable interest in recent years , and is being conducted using a wide variety of methods ( see , e.g. , reviews @xcite ) .",
    "two major directions of search for variation in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 are observational studies , such as analysis of high resolution spectroscopy from dark clouds in interstellar space ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and laboratory research , including frequency comparison of optical and microwave atomic clocks over extended periods of time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "great advantage may be gained in these searches by focusing on systems that have enhanced sensitivity to variation of @xmath0 or @xmath1 . for spectroscopy experiments ,",
    "such an enhancement may occur due to a quasi - degeneracy of two close lying levels of different nature , found in some atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite , and nuclei @xcite .",
    "chin and flambaum pointed out that a large enhancement ( on the order of @xmath4 ) could also be achieved in ultracold atomic collision experiments near feshbach resonances @xcite . in their work , the sensitivity of the scattering length to variations in the electron to proton mass ratio was investigated . here , we extend this work by further considering sensitivity to the fine structure constant .    the @xmath5-wave scattering length associated with the collision of two neutral atoms may be written as @xcite @xmath6 , \\label{eq : scattlength}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the mean scattering length and @xmath8 is the scattering phase shift .",
    "the mean scattering length is further given by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being a constant ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 the reduced mass , and @xmath13 the van der waals coefficient characterizing the long - range interatomic interaction .",
    "employing the semi - classical wkb approximation , the phase shift reads @xcite @xmath14}dr , \\label{eq : phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the molecular potential at internuclear separation @xmath16 and the limit @xmath17 corresponds to the inner turning point for zero kinetic energy of the colliding atoms , i.e. @xmath18 at the onset of the repulsive wall .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattlength ] ) , we see that the scattering length diverges at values of @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being an integer .",
    "such divergences may lead to enhanced sensitivity of the scattering length @xmath21 to variation of the fundamental constants : a small change in the phase shift @xmath8 could produce a significant change in the scattering length .",
    "however , the main enhancement is due to the large ratio @xmath22 , where @xmath12 is the reduced mass and @xmath23 is the electron mass .",
    "this large parameter justifies the applicability of wkb approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , to the motion of a heavy atom in the inter - atomic potential , which has an electron - volt scale , and also makes the phase very large . as a result , a tiny _ fractional _ change in the phase @xmath8 produces a dramatic change in @xmath24 and the scattering length in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "therefore , the effects of the variation of the fundamental constants manifest themselves mainly via a change in the phase @xmath8 .    from the explicit dependence of @xmath8 ,",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , on the reduced mass @xmath12 , it follows that a variation in @xmath1 produces an associated change in @xmath8 according to the simple relation @xcite @xmath25    here we consider the change of the scattering phase shift @xmath8 with respect to variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence arises from within the molecular potential @xmath15 due to relativistic effects , and the extraction of this dependence therefore requires _ ab - initio _ relativistic computations of the molecular potential .",
    "we compute the potential energy curve for the @xmath26 ground state of the cs@xmath27 dimer , and use the previously calculated relativistic and non - relativistic @xmath26 ground state potential energy curves for hg@xmath27 published by pahl _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , obtained at the coupled cluster level in the complete basis set limit . with these potential energy curves we are able to obtain reasonable estimates for the sensitivity of @xmath8 to @xmath0-variation for cs@xmath27 and hg@xmath27 .",
    "we present our results in terms of the factor @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . from this one",
    "can derive the change in the scattering length ( eq .  ( [ eq : scattlength ] ) ) with respect to variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath31 the above relation relies on two assumptions .",
    "first the potential should be deep enough or the reduced mass large enough ( as for cs@xmath27 or hg@xmath27 ) to support a large number of bound vibrational states , @xmath32 .",
    "then the phase can be estimated as @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is in neglecting the variation of the mean scattering length , @xmath7 , which is justified by the fact that it does not benefit from the enhanced sensitivity of the tangent function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattlength ] ) .",
    "we then go on to extend our findings to the case of feshbach resonances , where even greater enhancement of sensitivity to variation of fundamental constants can be expected @xcite .",
    "the dynamic formation of quasi - bound cs@xmath27 molecules near narrow feshbach resonances has been observed by chin _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "the scattering length has dimension of length ; hence we have to specify the units we use .",
    "it is convenient to use atomic units ( of energy , length , etc . ) . in these units",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 appears due to the relativistic corrections ( i.e. , terms containing @xmath34 ) . note that use of different units would not change our conclusions since the variation of the ratio of commonly used units ( e.g. , the bohr radius and meter ) is not enhanced ,",
    "while the variation of the ratio of the scattering length to the bohr radius is enhanced many orders of magnitude ; for a detailed explanation see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the first system of interest here is the cesium dimer .",
    "a fully analytical potential energy curve for the cs@xmath27 ground state has recently been given by coxon and hajigeorgiou @xcite .",
    "this curve employs several fitting parameters to accurately reproduce experimental spectroscopic data over 99.24% of the well depth . additionally , this curve has the appropriate asymptotic behavior describing the neutral atoms interacting at long - range , namely @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "this analytical potential energy curve , denoted as mlr3 by the authors , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2curve ] . performing the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , we find the scattering phase shift @xmath37     ground state of cs@xmath27 .",
    "the circles correspond to values calculated as described in the text and the solid line corresponds to the @xmath38 potential of ref .",
    "the dashed line represents the asymptotic part of the true potential energy curve , @xmath39 .",
    "all units are atomic units . ]",
    "we have computed the molecular potential curve at incremental values of @xmath16 using the relativistic molecular four - component program package dirac  @xcite .",
    "details of this calculation are saved for the appendix .",
    "our resulting values are overlaid on the mlr3 potential curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs2curve ] . from inspection of this figure",
    ", we note a good agreement between our computed values and @xmath38 in the vicinity of the equilibrium distance @xmath40 as well as at shorter distances . from the equilibrium distance",
    "we continue to have reasonable agreement up to @xmath41  a.u . , beyond which we compute values quite different to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the well depth is 10% too large .",
    "this is due to limitations in the basis set applied and the neglect of higher order contributions in our coupled - cluster expansion .",
    "further , the breit interaction may also change the potential energy curve in this region .    in principle",
    ", we may calculate @xmath8 using the potential energy curve determined from a fit of our computed data points , @xmath42 .",
    "we find , however , that this gives an entirely unsatisfactory result due to the inaccurate long - range behavior of this curve .",
    "firstly , the excessive well - depth implies that integration over @xmath16 in even the short - range is erroneous ( the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) contains the difference @xmath43 ) .",
    "secondly , the wrong asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 implies that a considerable amount of phase is inappropriately accumulated in the long - range beyond @xmath44 a.u .",
    "( the slow convergence is effectively magnified by the square root in the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) ) . clearly , to obtain a reasonable value of @xmath8",
    "it is necessary to satisfactorily treat the long - range part of the potential .",
    "we choose to do so by replacing the erroneous long - range part of our computed curve with the proper asymptotic behavior , @xmath39 , at a suitably chosen switching point @xmath45 .",
    "there is a certain degree of arbitrariness in this choice ; we set @xmath46 , as at this point the deviation of the mlr3 curve from the asymptotic curve , @xmath39 , is roughly equal to its deviation from the computed energy curve , but of an opposite sign , leading to error cancellation . taking the experimental potential depth and @xmath13 parameters @xcite ,",
    "we compute the scattering phase shift to be @xmath47 this result being 2% lower than the value obtained from the accurate mlr3 curve , eq .  ( [ eq : phimlr3 ] ) .",
    "we recompute the potential energy curve for different values of @xmath0 in the neighborhood of @xmath48 , and obtain the scattering phase using the method outlined above .",
    "it should be noted that the tail part of the potential has a considerable contribution to the calculated phase ( for the mrl3 curve , as much as 28% of the phase accumulates after @xmath49 a.u . ) .",
    "thus it is important to also take into account the variation of the @xmath13 parameter with respect to variations in @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain its dependence on @xmath0 in the appendix , and adjust the integration parameters accordingly .",
    "the potential well depth , @xmath50 , is rescaled using the following relation : @xmath51 d_e^\\mathrm{ccsd}(\\alpha ) , $ ] where @xmath52 is the calculated depth of the potential energy well for a given value of @xmath0 . by taking the numerical derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath0",
    "we are then able to obtain our estimated factor @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dphialphabeta ] ) .",
    "a different strategy was adopted for the mercury dimer .",
    "high accuracy calculations of both relativistic and non - relativistic potential energy curves were recently carried out with the correct long - range behavior from symmetry - adapted perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we integrate over these potentials to obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 for relativistic and non - relativistic energy curves , respectively . assuming linear dependence of molecular properties on @xmath55",
    ", we use the two points to derive @xmath28 for hg@xmath27 .",
    "note that we verified that the assumption of the linear dependence on @xmath55 works very well for cs@xmath27 . in mercury",
    "the non - linear corrections will be larger ; however , they should not significantly exceed the natural relativistic parameter @xmath56 , @xmath57 being the atomic number .",
    "the resulting values for the two systems are    @xmath58    a typical value of relativistic corrections is @xmath56 , which is equal to 0.34 for hg .",
    "this naturally explains the magnitude of @xmath28 for this system . for cs",
    "the result is smaller , due to an accidental cancellation between the contributions of the main and the asymptotic parts of the potential energy curve .",
    "it should be stressed here that the number of approximations employed in this work do not allow us to set reliable error limits on the obtained values of @xmath28 .",
    "however , performing test calculations with reasonable variation of the free parameters ( e.g. , @xmath45 and @xmath13 ) does not change the final result by more than 30% , which gives us a rough error estimate .",
    "we can nevertheless conclude that for heavy relativistic systems the sensitivity of the scattering phase to @xmath0 is of the same order of magnitude as its sensitivity to the electron to proton mass ratio ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this means that we have strongly enhanced sensitivity of the scattering length to the variation of @xmath0 and may use the equations presented in the introduction to estimate this sensitivity .",
    "a general estimate of the scattering length sensitivity for arbitrary atoms is @xmath60 where @xmath61 the enhancement is due to the large number @xmath32 of the vibrational levels in the interatomic potential . for cs , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 @xcite , the enhancement coefficient is given by @xmath65    more accurate result requires knowledge of the experimental value of the scattering length .",
    "unfortunately , the scattering length for hg@xmath27 is not available from experiment .",
    "in real scattering systems , the molecular potential has multiple channels .",
    "when a bound state in a closed channel near the dissociation limit is tuned close to the scattering state in an open channel , feshbach coupling between the two channels can lead to a resonant enhancement of the scattering length ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the scattering length near the resonance , @xmath21 is the off - resonant scattering length , @xmath68 characterizes the feshbach coupling strength , @xmath69 is the energy of the system ( in the case of cold scattering we can put @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 is the energy of the bound state .",
    "the main effect comes from the variation of the small energy denominator .",
    "variation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) is then @xcite @xmath72 where the small effect of the variation of @xmath68 is neglected .    to explore the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath0 and @xmath1",

    "they further obtained @xcite , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the density of states at the energy @xmath71 and can be estimated from the energy splitting , @xmath81 , between adjacent vibrational levels , @xmath82 . from similarity of expressions ( [ eq : phi2 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , we may provide a rough estimate , @xmath83 .",
    "this means that for the heavy atoms the enhancement coefficients for the effects of @xmath12 and @xmath0 variations are comparable .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , this enhancement near narrow feshbach resonances ( e.g. , near @xmath84-wave resonance in cs@xmath27 ) may reach @xmath85 .",
    "recently , a method for measurement of the scattering length to the accuracy @xmath86 was proposed @xcite .",
    "a combination of these two ideas makes the repeating measurements of the scattering length a promising method to study the variation of the fundamental constants in the laboratory .",
    "here we mention that the creation of ultracold @xmath87cs@xmath27 from feshbach resonances from bose - einstein condensates was demonstrated already by herbig _",

    "@xcite . in principle , cosmic data about scattering lengths and chemical reaction rates in the early universe may be used too .",
