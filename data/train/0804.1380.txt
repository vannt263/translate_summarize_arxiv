    "in this section , we show that the bijection @xmath10 can be succinctly expressed as a map between @xmath2-bounded partitions ( one whose first part is @xmath36 ) and @xmath340-bounded partitions , using the correspondence @xmath341 of lapointe and morse ( * ? ? ? * section 3 ) to which we refer the reader for more details .",
    "let @xmath342 be defined by the property that the left square in the following diagram commutes , and define @xmath343 to simply delete the first column from the diagram of the partition .",
    "then , we claim that the right square in the diagram also commutes . here , @xmath344 denotes the transpose of a partition .",
    "recall that @xmath346 denotes the hooklength of a box @xmath315 in a partition diagram @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath347 be an @xmath1-core with first column length @xmath2 .",
    "observe that @xmath342 acts by removing entire _ columns _ from @xmath21 by transposing the explanation in section  [ s : phi_on_diagram ] .",
    "row - wise , we can describe @xmath342 as removing the leftmost box @xmath315 in the row together with all of the boxes @xmath348 in the row having @xmath349 .",
    "_ _    as in @xcite , we view @xmath350 as the result of left - justifying all of the rows in a skew - diagram @xmath351 , where @xmath352 consists of the boxes of @xmath21 having hooklength @xmath353 .",
    "we say that the boxes of @xmath21 lying in @xmath351 are the _ skew boxes _ while the boxes of @xmath352 are the _ non - skew boxes__. _ _ _ _ _    suppose @xmath330 and consider the @xmath1-core @xmath354 . in the diagrams below , we have labeled the boxes by their hooklengths .",
    "the skew - boxes of @xmath355 are indicated in boldface , so @xmath356 . the entries that are deleted in the application of @xmath342 are indicated with underline .",
    "@xmath357 from these diagrams , we see that @xmath358 is a 4-core and @xmath359 .",
    "[ l : lm - one - rem ] there is exactly one skew box deleted from each row of @xmath21 in the application of @xmath342 .",
    "also , a box @xmath315 in @xmath21 that is not deleted in the application of @xmath342 is skew with respect to @xmath1 if and only if the corresponding box @xmath366 of @xmath358 is a skew box with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "it suffices to prove these statements for a fixed row .",
    "since the skew boxes are those with hooklength @xmath367 , we delete at most one skew box from each row of @xmath21 when we apply @xmath342 .",
    "next , we show that at least one skew box is deleted .",
    "let @xmath368 be the leftmost box of @xmath21 in row @xmath22 .",

    "form an unbalanced abacus @xmath8 of @xmath370 such that the beads of @xmath8 correspond to hooklengths of the first _ row _ of @xmath199 which is the @xmath371 row of @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , those beads corresponding to the boxes with equivalent hooklength to @xmath372 form the rightmost longest runner of the abacus @xmath8 and they are flush . hence , there exists a box @xmath373 in the same row as @xmath368 having hooklength @xmath374 such that @xmath375 , so the corresponding box @xmath373 is a skew box .",
    "the box @xmath373 is deleted from @xmath21 when we apply @xmath342 . _ _    to prove the second statement , suppose @xmath315 is a box in the @xmath22th row of @xmath21 that does not get deleted in @xmath362 .",
    "let @xmath366 be the corresponding box in @xmath362 .",

    "we have that @xmath315 is skew with respect to @xmath1 if and only if the corresponding bead lies on level 0 of the abacus @xmath8 .",
