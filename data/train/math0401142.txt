    "in the past fifteen years , remarkable progress has been made towards the understanding of the holomorphic extendability properties of cr functions .",
    "at the origin of this development , the most fundamental achievement was the deep discovery , due to the effort of numerous mathematicians , that the so - called _ cr orbits _ are the adequate underlying objects for the semi - local cr analysis on a general embedded cr manifold .",
    "as an independent and now established theory in several complex variables , one may find a precise correspondence between such orbits and progressively attached analytic discs covering a thick part of the envelope of holomorphy of cr manifolds , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a recent synthesis .    within this framework",
    ", it became mathematically accessible to endeavour the general study of removable singularities on embedded cr manifolds @xmath10 of arbitrary cr dimension and of arbitrary codimension , not necessarily being the boundaries of ( strictly ) pseudoconvex domains .",
    "with respect to their size or `` mass '' , the interesting singularities can be essentially ordered by their codimension in @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , provided it does not perturb the fact that @xmath2 consists of a single cr orbit , an arbitrary closed subset @xmath11 which is of vanishing 2-codimensional hausdorff content is _ always _ removable , as is shown in  @xcite in the hypersurface case and in @xcite , theorem  1.1 , in arbitrary codimension .",
    "hence one is left to study the removability of singularities of codimension at most two . since the general problem of characterizing removability seems at the moment to be out of reach ( even for @xmath2 being a hypersurface )",
    ", it is advisible to focus on geometrically accessible singularities , namely singularities contained in a cr submanifold of @xmath2 .",
    "a complete study of the automatic removability of two - codimensional singularities may be found in theorem  4 of  @xcite .",
    "having in mind the classical painlev problem , we will mainly consider in this paper singularities which are closed sets @xmath12 contained in a _",
    "codimension one _ submanifold @xmath13 of @xmath2 which is _ generic _ in @xmath14 .",
    "the known results on singularities of codimension one can be subdivided into two strongly different groups according to the _ cr dimension _ of @xmath2 . if @xmath15 , then a generic hypersurface @xmath16 is itself a cr manifold of positive cr dimension , and singularities @xmath17 can be understood on the basis of the interplay between @xmath12 and the cr orbits of @xmath13 .",
    "deep results in this direction were established when @xmath2 is a hypersurface of @xmath14 in  @xcite , @xcite and then generalized to cr manifolds of arbitrary codimension in  @xcite : the geometric condition insuring automatic removability is simply that @xmath12 does not contain any cr orbit of @xmath13 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath18 the geometric situation becomes highly different , as a generic hypersurface @xmath16 is now ( maximal ) _ totally real_. fortunately , as a substitute for the cr orbits of @xmath13 , one can consider the so - called _ characteristic foliation _ of @xmath13 , obtained by integrating the characteristic line field @xmath19 .",
    "but removability theorems exploiting this concept were only known for hypersurfaces in @xmath3 and , until very recently , only in the strictly pseudoconvex case .",
    "furthermore , a geometric condition insuring automatic removablitity has not yet been clearly delineated .",
    "hence , with respect to the current state of the art , there was a two - fold gap about codimension one removable singularities contained in generic submanifolds @xmath2 of cr dimension one : firstly , to establish a satisfying theory for non - pseudoconvex hypersurfaces in @xmath3 and secondly , to understand the situation in higher codimension .",
    "this second main task was formulated as the first open problem in a list p.  432 of @xcite ( _ see _ also the comments pp .",
    "431432 about the relative geometric simplicity of the case @xmath20 ) .",
    "_ a priori _ , it is not clear at all whether the two directions of research are related somehow , but in the present work , we shall fill in this two - fold gap by devising a new semi - local approach which applies uniformly with respect to codimension .    for the detailed discussion of our result",
    "we have to introduce some terminology which will be used throughout the article .",
    "let @xmath2 be a generic submanifold of @xmath14 and let @xmath12 be a closed subset of @xmath2 . recall from  @xcite that a _",
    "wedgelike domain _ attached to a generic submanifold @xmath21 is a domain containing a local wedge of edge @xmath22 at every point of @xmath22 .",
    "our wedgelike domains will always be _",
    "nonempty_. let us define three basic notions of removability .",
    "firstly , we say that @xmath12 is _ cr - removable _ if there exists a wedgelike domain @xmath7 attached to @xmath2 to which every continuous cr function @xmath23 extends holomorphically . secondly ,",
    "as in  @xcite , p.  486 , we say that @xmath12 is _",
    "@xmath7-removable _ if for every wedgelike domain @xmath24 attached to @xmath25 , there is a wedgelike domain @xmath26 attached to @xmath2 and a wedgelike domain @xmath27 attached to @xmath25 such that for every holomorphic function @xmath28 , there exists a holomorphic function @xmath29 which coincides with @xmath30 in @xmath31 .",
    "thirdly , with @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 , we say that @xmath12 is _",
    "@xmath34-removable _ if every locally integrable function @xmath35 which is cr in the distributional sense on @xmath36 is in fact cr on all of @xmath2 .",
    "the first notion of removability is a generalization of the kind of removability considered in most of the pioneering papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite about removable singularities in boundaries of domains @xmath37 .",
    "we observe that a wedgelike open set attached to a hypersurface @xmath2 is just a ( global ) one - sided neighborhood of @xmath2 , namely a domain @xmath38 with @xmath39 such that for every point @xmath40 , the domain @xmath38 contains the intersection of a neighborhood of @xmath41 in @xmath14 with one side of @xmath2 .",
    "if now a closed set @xmath12 contained in a @xmath42-smooth bounded boundary @xmath43 is cr - removable , then an application of the hartogs - bochner theorem shows that cr functions on @xmath44 can be holomorphically extended to @xmath45 .",
    "the second notion of removability is a way to isolate the part of the question related to envelopes of holomorphy .",
    "the third notion of removability has the advantage of being completely intrinsic with respect to @xmath2 and may be relevant in the study of non - embeddable cr manifolds .    to avoid confusion , we state precisely our submanifold notion : @xmath46 is a _",
    "submanifold of @xmath47 _ if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are equipped with a manifold structure , if there exists an immersion @xmath48 of @xmath46 into @xmath47 and if the manifold topology of @xmath46 and the topology of @xmath49 inherited from the topology of @xmath47 coincide , so that one may identify the submanifold @xmath46 with the subset @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , our submanifolds will always be connected .",
    "let us now enter the discussion of the case @xmath51 . here",
    "we shall denote the submanifold @xmath16 , which is a surface in @xmath3 , by @xmath0 . in  @xcite",
    ", e.  bishop showed that a two - dimensional surface in @xmath3 of class at least @xmath52 having an isolated complex tangency at one of its points @xmath41 may be represented by a complex equation of the form @xmath53 , in terms of local holomorphic coordinates @xmath54 vanishing at @xmath41 , where the real parameter @xmath55 is a biholomorphic invariant of @xmath0 .",
    "the point @xmath41 is said to be _ elliptic _ if @xmath56 , _ parabolic _ if @xmath57 and _ hyperbolic _ if @xmath58 . recall that @xmath2 is called _ globally minimal _ if it consists of a single cr orbit ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , pp .",
    "814815 ; and  @xcite , pp .",
    "266269 ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall work in the @xmath4-smooth category , where @xmath59 .",
    "our first main new result is as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a globally minimal @xmath4-smooth hypersurface in @xmath3 and let @xmath60 be a @xmath61-smooth surface which is    * @xmath62-diffeomorphic to the unit @xmath1-disc of @xmath63 and * totally real outside a discrete subset of isolated complex tangencies which are hyperbolic in the sense of e.  bishop .",
    "then every compact subset @xmath6 of @xmath45 is cr- , @xmath7- and @xmath8-removable .    as a corollary ,",
    "one obtains a corresponding result about holomorphic extension from @xmath64 for the case that @xmath2 is the boundary of a relatively compact domain @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath66 is automatically globally minimal ( @xcite , section  2 ) .",
    "we will first recall the historical background of theorem 1.1 and explain afterwards on this basis the main ideas and techniques necessary for the proof .    in 1988 , applying a global version of the kontinuittssatz , b.  jricke  @xcite established a remarkable theorem : every compact subset of a totally real @xmath52-smooth @xmath1-disc lying on the boundary of the unit ball in @xmath67 is cr - removable .",
    "this discovery motivated the work  @xcite by f.  forstneri@xmath68 and e.l .",
    "stout , where it is shown that every @xmath52-smooth compact @xmath1-disc contained in a strictly pseudoconvex @xmath52-smooth boundary @xmath69 contained in a @xmath1-dimensional stein manifold @xmath70 which is totally real except at a finite number of hyperbolic complex tangencies is removable ; the proof mainly relies on a previous work by e.  bedford and w.  klingenberg about the hulls of @xmath1-spheres contained in such strictly pseudoconvex boundaries @xmath71 , which may be filled by levi - flat @xmath72-spheres after a generic small perturbation ( @xcite , theorem  1 ) .",
    "indirectly , it followed from  @xcite and  @xcite that such compact totally real @xmath1-discs @xmath73 ( possibly having finitely many hyperbolic complex tangencies ) are @xmath74-convex and in particular polynomially convex if @xmath75 and @xmath76 , thanks to a previous work  @xcite by e.l .",
    "sout , where it is shown ( theorem  ii.10 ) that a compact subset @xmath6 of a @xmath52-smooth strictly pseudoconvex boundary @xmath66 in a stein manifold is removable _ if and only if _ @xmath6 is @xmath77-convex .",
    "it is also established in  @xcite that a neighborhood of an isolated hyperbolic complex tangency in @xmath3 is polynomially convex .",
    "these papers have been followed by the work  @xcite , where the question of @xmath77-convexity of _ arbitrary compact surfaces _ @xmath0 ( with or without boundary , not necessarily diffeomorphic to a @xmath1-disc ) contained in a @xmath52-smooth strictly pseudoconvex domain @xmath78 is dealt with directly . using k.  oka s characterization of the envelope of a compact , j.  duval shows that the essential hull @xmath79 must cross every leaf of the characteristic foliation on the totally real part of @xmath0 and he deduces that a compact @xmath1-disc having only hyperbolic complex tangencies is @xmath80-convex .",
    "all the above proofs heavily rely on strong pseudoconvexity , in contrast to the experience , familiar at least in the case @xmath81 , that removability should depend rather on the structure of cr orbits than on levi curvature .",
    "the first theorem for the non - pseudoconvex situation was established by the second author in @xcite .",
    "he proved that every compact subset of a totally real disc embedded in a globally minimal @xmath82-smooth hypersurface in @xmath3 is always cr - removable .",
    "we would like to point out that , seeking theorems without any assumption of pseudoconvexity leads to substantial open problems , because one loses almost all of the strong interweavings between function - theoretic tools and geometric arguments which are valid in the pseudoconvex realm , for instance : hopf lemma , plurisubharmonic exhaustions , envelopes of function spaces , local maximum modulus principle , stein neighborhood basis , _ etc . _    to discuss the main elements of our approach , let us briefly explain the geometric setup of the proof of theorem 1.1 .",
    "the characteristic foliation has isolated singularities at the hyperbolic points , where it looks like the phase diagram of a saddle point .",
    "in particular there are four local separatrices accumulating orthogonally at each hyperbolic point",
    ". hence we can decompose the @xmath1-disc @xmath45 as a union @xmath83 , where @xmath84 consists of the union of the hyperbolic points of @xmath45 together with the separatrices issuing from them , and where @xmath85 is the remaining open submanifold of @xmath45 , contained in the totally real part of @xmath45 . by h.  poincar and i.  bendixson s theory",
    ", @xmath84 is a tree of @xmath86-smooth curves which contains no subset homeomorphic to the unit circle , _ cf . _",
    "accordingly , we decompose @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a proper closed subset of the tree @xmath84 and where @xmath89 is a relatively closed subset of @xmath90 .",
    "the hard part of the proof , which was actually the starting point of the whole paper , will consist in removing the closed subset @xmath91 of the @xmath1-dimensional surface @xmath92 lying in @xmath93 .",
    "thereafter the removal of the remaining part @xmath94 will be done by means of an investigation of the behaviour of the cr orbits near @xmath84 , close in spirit to our previous methods in  @xcite ( _ see _ section  12 below for the details ) .",
    "let us formulate the first crucial part of the above argument as an independent theorem about the removal of closed subsets contained in a totally real surface @xmath0 .",
    "we point out that now @xmath0 may have _",
    "arbitrary topology_.    let @xmath2 be a @xmath95-smooth globally minimal hypersurface in @xmath3 , let @xmath96 be a @xmath97-smooth surface , open or closed , with or without boundary , which is totally real at every point .",
    "let @xmath12 be a proper closed subset of @xmath0 and assume that the following topological condition holds :    * for every closed subset @xmath98 , there exists a simple @xmath99-smooth curve @xmath100 \\to s$ ] , whose range is contained in a single leaf of the characteristic foliation @xmath101 ( obtained by integrating the characteristic line field @xmath102 ) , with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , such that @xmath106 lies completely in one closed side of @xmath107 $ ] with respect to the topology of @xmath0 in a neighborhood of @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath12 is cr- , @xmath7- and @xmath8-removable .",
    "the condition @xmath109 is a _ common condition _ on @xmath12 and on the characteristic foliation @xmath110 , namely on the relative disposition of @xmath110 with respect to @xmath12 , not only on @xmath0 ; an illustration may be found in figure  2 below . in the strictly pseudoconvex context , this condition appeared implicitly during the course of the proofs given in @xcite .",
    "note that the relevance of the characteristic foliation had earlier been discovered in contact geometry , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that it re - appears in the situation of theorem 1.2 , where the underlying distribution @xmath111 is allowed to be very far from contact .",
    "as is known , it follows from a subcase of h.  poincar and i.  bendixson s theory that if @xmath0 is diffeomorphic to a real @xmath1-disc or if @xmath112 as above , then @xmath113 is automatically satisfied for an arbitry compact subset @xmath12 of @xmath0 . on the contrary , it may be not satisfied when for instance @xmath0 is an annulus equipped with a radial foliation together with @xmath12 containing a continuous closed curve around the hole of @xmath0 . crucially , it is elementary to construct an example of such an annulus which is truly nonremovable .",
    "indeed , the small closed curve @xmath12 which consists of the transversal intersection of a strictly convex boundary @xmath43 with a complex line close to a boundary point may be enlarged as a thin maximally real strip @xmath114 which is diffeomorphic to an annulus ; in this setting , @xmath12 is obviously nonremovable and _ the characteristic foliation is everywhere transversal to @xmath12_. consequently , the geometric condition @xmath115 is the optimal one insuring automatic removability for all choices of @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "further examples of closed subsets in surfaces with arbitrary genus equipped with such foliations may be exhibited .    in the proof of theorem  1.2 , after some contraction @xmath106 of @xmath12 , we may assume that no point of @xmath106 is locally removable ( _ see _ sections  2 and  3 below )",
    ". then the very assumption @xmath116 yields the existence of a characteristic segment @xmath108 $ ] , such that @xmath106 lies on one side of @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "reasoning by contradiction , our aim is to show that there exists at least one special point @xmath117 , which is _ locally _ cr- , @xmath7- and @xmath34-removable .",
    "the choice of such a point @xmath41 , achieved in section  5 below , will be nontrivial .",
    "the strategy for the local removal of @xmath41 is to construct an analytic disc @xmath118 such that a segment of its boundary @xmath119 is attached to @xmath0 and touches @xmath106 in only one point @xmath41 .",
    "several geometrical assumptions have to be met to ensure that a sufficiently rich family of deformations of @xmath118 have boundaries disjoint from @xmath106 , that analytic extension along these discs is possible ( i.e.  appropriate moment conditions are satisfied ) , and that the union of these good discs is large enough to give analytic extension to a one - sided neighborhood of @xmath2 : this is where the ( semi)localization and the choice of the special point @xmath120 will be key ingredients .",
    "let us explain why localization is crucial .",
    "working globallly , the second author produced in  @xcite a convenient disc by applying the powerful e.  bedford and w.  klingenberg theorem to an appropriate 2-sphere containing a neighborhood of the _ entire _ singularity @xmath106 .",
    "this method requires global properties of @xmath0 like @xmath0 being a totally real @xmath1-disc , which ensures the existence of a nice stein neighborhood basis of @xmath106 .",
    "already for real discs with isolated hyperbolic points , it is not clear whether this argument can be generalized ( however , we would like to mention that recent results of m.  slapar in  @xcite indicate that this could be possible at least if the geometry near the hyperbolic points satisfies some additional assumptions ) . in the case where @xmath2 is an arbitrary globally minimal",
    "hypersurface , where @xmath0 has arbitrary topology and has complex tangencies , the reduction to e.  bedford and w.  klingenberg s theorem seems impossible , _ cf . _",
    "the example of an unknotted nonfillable @xmath1-sphere in @xmath3 constructed by j.e .",
    "fornss and d.  ma in  @xcite . also , to the authors knowledge , the possibility of filling by levi - flat @xmath72-spheres the ( not necessarily generic ) @xmath1-spheres lying on a _ nonpseudoconvex _ hypersurface is a delicate open problem .",
    "in addition , for the higher codimensional generalization of theorem  1.2 , the idea of global filling seems to be irrelevant at present times , because no analog of the e.  bedford and w.  klingenberg theorem is known in dimension @xmath121 .",
    "as we aim to deal with surfaces @xmath0 having arbitrary topology and to generalize these results in arbitrary codimension , we shall endeavour to firmly _ localize the removability arguments _ , using only small analytic discs .",
    "thus , our way to overcome these obstacles is to consider _ local",
    "_ discs @xmath118 which are only partially attached to @xmath0 .",
    "the delicate point is that we have at the same time ( i ) to control the geometry of @xmath119 near @xmath120 and ( ii ) to guarantee that the rest of the boundary stays in the region where holomorphic extension is already known .",
    "in fact , ( ii ) will be incorporated in our very special and tricky choice of @xmath120 . for ( i ) , we have to sharpen known existence theorems about partially attached analytic discs and to combine it with a careful study of the complex / real geometry of the pair @xmath122 .",
    "importantly , our construction of such analytic discs is achieved elementarily in a self - contained way .",
    "a precise description of the proof in the hypersurface case ( only ) may be found in section  2 below . with some substantial extra work",
    ", we shall generalize this purely local strategy of proof to higher codimension .    to conclude with the removal of surfaces ,",
    "let us formulate a more general version of theorem  1.1 , whitout the restricted topological assumption that @xmath0 be diffeomorphic to a real disc .",
    "applying theorem  1.2 for the removal of @xmath123 and a slight generalization of theorem  4 ( ii ) in  @xcite for the removal of @xmath124 ( more precisions will be given in  13 below ) , we shall obtain the following statement , implying theorem  1.1 as a direct corollary .",
    "let @xmath2 be a @xmath95-smooth globally minimal hypersurface in @xmath3 , let @xmath96 be a @xmath97-smooth totally real surface , open or closed , with or without boundary , which is totally real outside a discrete subset of isolated complex tangencies which are hyperbolic in the sense of e.  bishop .",
    "let @xmath125 be the union of hyperbolic points of @xmath0 together with all separatrices issued from hyperbolic points and assume that @xmath125 does not contain any subset which is homeomorphich to the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath6 be a proper compact subset of @xmath0 and assume that @xmath126 holds .",
    "then @xmath6 is cr- , @xmath7- and @xmath8-removable .",
    "as was already emphasized , our main motivation for this work was to _ devise a local strategy of proof for theorems  1.1 , 1.2 and  1.3 in order to generalize them to higher codimension_. in fact , we will realize the program sketched above for generic submanifolds of cr dimension @xmath9 and of arbitrary codimension .",
    "thus , let @xmath2 be a @xmath62-smooth globally minimal generic submanifold of codimension @xmath127 in @xmath14 , hence of cr dimension @xmath9 , where @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a maximally real @xmath62-smooth one - codimensional submanifold of @xmath2 which is generic in @xmath14 .",
    "as in the surface case , @xmath13 carries a _",
    "characteristic foliation _",
    "@xmath129 , whose leaves are the integral curves of the line distribution @xmath130 .",
    "of course the assumption that the singularity lies on one side of some characteristic segment is no longer reasonable",
    ". we will generalize it as a condition requiring ( approximatively speaking ) that there be always a characteristic segment which is accessible from the complement of @xmath12 in @xmath13 along one direction normal to the characteristic segment .",
    "the generalization of theorem  1.2 , which is our principal result in this paper , is as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 , @xmath13 , @xmath131 be as above and let @xmath12 be a proper closed subset of @xmath2 .",
    "assume that the following topological condition , meaning that @xmath12 is not transversal to the characteristic foliation , holds :    * for every closed subset @xmath132 , there exists a simple @xmath133-smooth curve @xmath134 \\to m^1 $ ] whose range @xmath108 $ ] is contained in a single leaf of the characteristic foliation @xmath135 with @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath105 , there exists a local @xmath138-dimensional transversal @xmath139 to @xmath140 passing through @xmath141 and there exists a thin elongated open neighborhood @xmath142 of @xmath143 $ ] in @xmath13 such that if @xmath144 denotes the semi - local projection parallel to the leaves of the characteristic foliation @xmath135 , then @xmath141 lies on the boundary , relatively to the topology of @xmath145 , of @xmath146 .",
    "then @xmath12 is cr- , @xmath7- and @xmath8-removable .    the condition @xmath147 , which is of course independent of the choice of the transversal @xmath145 and of the thin neighborhood @xmath142 , is illustrated in figure  8 of  5.1 below ; clearly , in the case @xmath148 , it means that @xmath149 lies completely in one side of @xmath107 $ ] , with respect to the topology of @xmath13 , as written in the statement of theorem  1.2 .",
    "applying some of our previous results in this direction ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we shall provide in the end of section  13 below some formulations of applications of theorem  1.2 , close to being analogs of theorem  1.3 in higher codimension .",
    "importantly , in order to let the geometric condition @xmath150 appear less mysterious and to argue that it provides the adequate generalization of theorem  1.2 to higher codimension , in the last section  14 below , we shall describe an example of @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 in @xmath151 violating the condition @xmath152 , such that @xmath12 is transversal to the characteristic foliation and is truly nonremovable .",
    "this example will be analogous in some sense to the example of a nonremovable annulus discussed after the statement of theorem  1.2",
    ". since there is no h.  poincar and i.  bendixson theorem for foliations of @xmath72-dimensional balls by curves , it will be even possible to insure that @xmath2 and @xmath13 are diffeomorphic to real balls of dimension @xmath153 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "we may therefore conclude that theorem  1.2 provides the desirable answer to the ( already cited _ supra _ ) problem  2.1 raised by b.  jricke in  @xcite , p.  432 .    to pursue the presentation of our results ,",
    "let us comment the assumption that @xmath2 be of codimension @xmath127 .",
    "geometrically speaking , the study of closed singularities @xmath12 lying in a one - codimensional generic submanifold @xmath13 of a generic submanifold @xmath10 which is of cr dimension @xmath154 is more simple .",
    "indeed , thanks to the fact that @xmath13 is of cr dimension @xmath155 , there exist local bishop discs _ completely attached to @xmath13 _ , and this helps much in describing the envelope of holomorphy of a wedge attached to @xmath25 . on the contrary , in the case where @xmath2 is of cr dimension @xmath9 , small analytic discs attached to a maximally real @xmath13 are ( trivially ) inexistent .",
    "this is why , in the proof of our main theorems  1.2 and  1.2 , we shall deal only with small analytic discs whose boundary is in part ( only ) contained in @xmath13 .",
    "such discs are known to exist ; we would like to mention that historically speaking , the first construction of discs partially attached to maximally real submanifolds was exhibited by s.  pinchuk in  @xcite , who developed the ideas of e.  bishop  @xcite .",

    "in fact , we observe that there can not exist a uniform removability statement covering both the case @xmath159 and the case @xmath154 , whence theorem  1.2 is stronger than theorem  1.4 . indeed , the elementary example of a nonremovable circle in an annulus contained in the boundary of a strictly convex domain of @xmath3 shows that @xmath12 may be truly nonremovable whereas it does not contain any characteristic curve . in the strictly pseudoconvex hypersurface setting",
    ", it is well known that hopf s lemma implies that boundaries of riemann surfaces contained in @xmath12 ( and also the track on @xmath12 of its essential hull , _ cf .",

    "the reason why @xmath152 implies that @xmath12 is removable also in the nonpseudoconvex setting and in arbitrary codimension will be appearant later . finally , we mention that the @xmath34-removability of @xmath12 in theorem  1.4 holds more generally with no assumption of global minimality on @xmath2 , as already noticed in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ". however , since the case where @xmath2 is not globally minimal essentially reduces to the consideration of its cr orbits , which are globally minimal by definition , we shall only deal with globally minimal generic submanifolds @xmath2 throughout this paper .    as a final comment ,",
    "we point out that , _ because the previously known proofs of theorem  1.4 were of local type , it is satisfactory to bring in this paper a purely local framework for the treatment of theorems  1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 and  1.2_.    our second group of applications concerns the classical edge of the wedge theorem .",
    "typically one considers a maximally real edge @xmath160 to which an open double wedge @xmath161 is attached from opposite directions .",
    "one may interprete this configuration as a partial thickening of a generic cr manifold @xmath162 containing @xmath160 as a generic hypersurface .",
    "the classical edge of the wedge theorem states that functions which are continuous on @xmath163 and holomorphic in @xmath164 extend holomorphically to a neighborhood of @xmath160 .",
    "theorem 1.2 implies that it suffices to assume continuity outside a removable singularities of @xmath160 .",
    "this allows us to derive an edge of the wedge theorem for meromorphic extension ( section  13 below ) .",
    "this paper is divided in two parts : part i contains the strategy per absurdum for the proof of theorem  1.2 , the construction of what we call a semi - local half - wedge and the choice of a special point to be removed locally .",
    "part  ii contains the explicit construction of families of half - attached analytic discs , the end of proof of theorem  1.2 and the proofs of the various applications .",

    "our goal is to provide a conceptional description of the basic geometric constructions , which should be helpful to read the whole paper .",

    "let @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath12 be as in theorem  1.2 .",

    "thus , we shall describe in this section only the @xmath7-removability of @xmath12 .",

    ". if @xmath168 is empty , the conclusion of theorem  1.2 holds , gratuitously : nothing has to be proved .",
    "if @xmath171 is nonempty , to come to an absurd , it suffices to show that at least one point of @xmath168 is _ locally removable_. by this , we mean that there exists a local one - sided neighborhood @xmath172 of at least one point of @xmath173 such that holomorphic functions in @xmath169 extend holomorphically to @xmath172 .",
    "in fact , the choice of such a point will be the most delicate and the most tricky part of the proof .    in order to be in position to apply the continuity principle ,",
    "we now deform slightly @xmath2 inside the one - sided neighborhood @xmath169 , keeping @xmath168 fixed , getting a hypersurface @xmath174 ( with @xmath175 like `` _ d_eformed '' ) satisfying @xmath176 .",

    "one can even formulate a slightly more general version of theorem  1.2 , where the global minimality assumption is replaced by the assumption of holomorphic extension to a wedge attached to @xmath25 .",
    "of course , with this more general assumption , @xmath2 may consists of several cr orbits , but thanks to lemma  3.5 about stability of cr orbits , one may check that the proof of the main theorem  3.19 * ( i ) * and of the main proposition  5.12 remain unchanged , in the case where holomorphic extension is assumed in a wedgelike domain over @xmath25 and not only in wedgelike domains attached to the cr orbits of @xmath25 .",
    "thus this slight generalization of theorem  1.2 together with the observation made in lemma  10.5 just above yield that for all @xmath232 with @xmath2170 and for all @xmath206 with @xmath2196 , the closed subset @xmath2197 is @xmath7-removable in the generic submanifold @xmath2198 .",
