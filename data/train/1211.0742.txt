    "quiescent prominences are large clouds of relatively cool plasma supported against gravity by their magnetic field .",
    "it is known that the temperature of quiescent prominences is approximately 8000k @xcite and density @xmath6@xmath7 @xcite which is a decrease and increase of approximately two orders of magnitude respectively from the surrounding corona . using this value for the temperature",
    "the pressure scale height can be calculated as @xmath8 km , which is approximately @xmath9 orders of magnitude less than the characteristic height of a quiescent prominence ( @xmath10 mm * ? ? ?",
    "there are many reviews that describe the current understanding of the nature of quiescent prominences ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations by the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the hinode satellite @xcite have shown that on very small scales quiescent prominences are highly dynamic and unstable phenomena . @xcite and @xcite reported dark upflows that propagate from large ( @xmath0 mm in size ) bubbles that formed at the base of some quiescent prominences , through a height of approximately @xmath11 mm before dispersing into the background prominence material .",
    "an example of these plumes is shown in figure [ prom ] .",
    "observations by @xcite show that the bubble and plumes have a minimum temperature of @xmath12k .",
    "the dark upflows were found to rise at constant velocity of @xmath13kms@xmath14 .",
    "often these plumes would separate from the cavity forming bubbles inside the prominence material .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that the observed upflows were caused by the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability , as a mixed mode perturbation with an interchange mode ( @xmath15 perpendicular to @xmath16 ) and an undular mode ( @xmath15 parallel to @xmath16 ) , in the high atwood number limit [ @xmath17 , where @xmath15 is the wave number , @xmath18 is the density of the region above the contact discontinuity and @xmath19 is the density of the below the contact discontinuity . @xcite",
    "described how the theoretically predicted growth rates and behaviour for the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability well match the observations of quiescent prominence plumes . @xcite and @xcite showed how upflows could be created by the 3d mode of the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability acting on the boundary between the kippenhahn - schlter prominence model @xcite and a hot tube inserted into the it .",
    "the upflows created were found to be qualitatively similar to the observed plumes .",
    "observations of the magnetic field of quiescent prominences show the field strength to be in the range @xmath20-@xmath21 g @xcite , where the average for polar - crown prominences is @xmath22 g @xcite .",
    "however , as it is very difficult to observe the prominence magnetic field directly , often other methods to determine the magnetic field of prominences have been employed .",
    "one common mechanism has been to extrapolate the photospheric magnetic field to obtain values for the coronal field where the prominence is observed @xcite .",
    "another common method is to analyse the oscillatory pattern of filaments @xcite or filament threads @xcite to calculate the magnetic field through the application of wave theory .",
    "this is known as prominence seismology @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new method to investigate the magnetic field strength relative to the gas pressure by determining the plasma @xmath1 ( ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure ) of a prominence through the study of compression of the prominence material by the rayleigh - taylor plumes .",
    "before the methodology through which the prominence plasma @xmath1 can be determined is presented , first we will quickly review the observational characteristics of the prominence plumes that are important for this analysis .",
    "the points we need to remember are @xcite :    * the plumes have a phase in their evolution where they rise at an approximately constant velocity * the plumes have an approximately circular ( elliptical ) head * the intensity of the prominence material at the top of the plume is greater than the average prominence intensity . * flows of material can be observed along the head of the plume    to make it possible to use these observables , a number of assumptions are necessary .",
    "the first is in relation to the density of the prominence .",
    "the prominence intensity is known to be a result of scattering .",
    "therefore the intensity is directly related to the column density of the prominence .",
    "this allows us to assume that the intensity can be used as a proxy for the density .",
    "hence the bright top of the plume would imply that there has been an increase in the density through compression of the prominence .",
    "the next assumption is in relation to the modelling of the geometry of the problem .",
    "as the plume moves at an approximately constant velocity with an elliptical head , this can be used to simplify the system under study .",
    "the first step is to remove the stem of the plume , and just leave an ellipse in the prominence material .",
    "then as this ellipse is moving at constant velocity through ( what we assume to be ) a constant medium , a shift in reference frame can make the situation of an ellipse , stationary in a constant flow .",
    "the effect of a non - stationary prominence will be investigated to some extent later .",
    "now we must consider the 3d nature of the geometry under investigation .",
    "the observed plumes are known to be caused by the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite it is also known that the 3d magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability creates filamentary structures aligned with the magnetic field @xcite or the bi - sector of the upper an lower magnetic fields in the case where shear is present @xcite .",
    "therefore we can view the problem as being similar to a elliptical cylinder in a constant flow .",
    "then a coordinate transform to cylindrical coordinates would effectively give a circle in a constant flow .",
    "this has now reduced to a problem that has been significantly studied in fluid dynamics .",
    "the transform described above is a conformal transform of the coordinate system . in an incompressible regime ,",
    "such a conformal transform would automatically give the correct result , but in a compressible regime , where nonlinearity is important , the velocity will not be completely accurate .",
    "the smaller the eccentricity and the fast - mode mach number , the more accurate the coordinate transform will be .",
    "here we use a classic result from fluid dynamics to define a set of equations that can be used to interpret prominence observations and determine physical parameters relating to that prominence .",
    "first , we describe the thought process behind the method , followed by a derivation of the equations used to determine the plasma @xmath1 of the prominence .",
    "the derivation presented here is analogous to that presented in @xcite for a compressible flow around a circular cylinder in a steady state . here",
    "the derivation is altered to include a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane in which the plasma is flowing . in this derivation",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is in the @xmath23-direction and the flow has velocity components in the @xmath24- and @xmath25-direction .",
    "all derivatives in the @xmath23-direction are assumed to be @xmath26 .",
    "the validity of these assumptions will be investigated through comparisons with simulations in section [ sim ] .",
    "this analysis uses the equations of mass conservation , momentum and energy .",
    "the equation of mass conservation , for a steady planar two - dimensional flow is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the density , the @xmath24-component of the velocity and the @xmath25-component of the velocity .",
    "the equation presented above is for a steady state solution , so there is no temporal variation of the density and the velocity field .",
    "all these values have been normalised by the free stream reference values for density @xmath31 and velocity @xmath32 , where the values with the subscript @xmath33 denote the values upstream of the plume head .",
    "this can then be rewritten to give : @xmath34    if the flow is irrotational , then the momentum equations can be simply replaced by the statement that the vorticity is zero , that is : @xmath35 which is satisfied by the velocity potential @xmath36 where : @xmath37    the next step is to relate @xmath28 to the velocity , so that equation [ mass_cons ] can be expressed purely in velocity derivatives , that is to say purely in derivatives of @xmath36 . for a perfect gas under adiabatic contraction / expansion that has a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the flow ,",
    "the mhd - bernoulli s equation can be written as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is used to show that the value is constant along streamlines .",
    "therefore , the values of the physical variables at each point in the flow can related to the free stream values ( the values of the flow at an infinite distance from the circular cylinder ) .",
    "@xmath40 where the subscript @xmath33 implies the free stream values that are used for normalisation .",
    "if we define the free stream speed of sound as @xmath41 , the free stream alfven velocity as @xmath42 and denote the free stream mach number as @xmath43 then equation [ energy ] becomes : @xmath44 we can then define a relation between the alfven velocity and the sound speed as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the free stream plasma @xmath1 .",
    "this then gives : @xmath47    as we have assumed that the flow is irrotational , we can assume that the flow is constant entropy . for a perfect gas ( in normalised form )",
    "this can be expressed as : @xmath48 .",
    "we can also use the identity that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 defines the plasma @xmath1 of system .",
    "using these identities , equation [ mach_eqn ] becomes @xmath51 to tidy up the equations , we define : @xmath52 giving : @xmath53    for simplicity , we will now make the assumption that the plasma @xmath1 is approximately uniform . in reality",
    ", we would have to solve for this using the induction equation , but for simplicity this is neglected in this analysis .",
    "this leads to the following equation : @xmath54 now it is possible to combine equation [ reduced_en ] with equation [ mass_cons ] to determine an equation for the velocity field .",
    "if we follow the derivation by @xcite , by transforming to cylindrical coordinates ( where the length - scale is normalised by the radius of the cylinder ) we can then calculate the velocity potential @xmath36 ( with all @xmath55 ) : @xmath56\\ ] ] where : @xmath57 which can be viewed as the fast - mode mach number .",
    "using @xmath58 , we get : @xmath59 \\notag \\\\ & + o({m_*}^4)\\label{vr}\\\\ v_{\\theta}(r,\\theta ) = & -\\left(1+\\frac{1}{r^2 } \\right)\\sin \\theta + { m_*}^2\\left [ \\left(\\frac{13}{12}\\frac{1}{r^2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{r^4}+\\frac{1}{12}\\frac{1}{r^6 } \\right ) \\sin\\theta -\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\frac{1}{r^4 } - \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{r^2 } \\right)3 \\cos ^2 \\theta \\sin \\theta    \\right ] \\notag \\\\ & + o({m_*}^4)\\label{vthe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      it is now necessary to derive an equation for the distribution of the density .",
    "we need to convert equation [ reduced_en ] to cylindrical coordinates : @xmath60 rewriting equation [ derivedeqn ] , we find : @xmath61 this equation can now be used to determine the expected density distribution around a plume head .",
    "figure [ eqnden ] shows the density distribution around a circular cylinder .",
    "the high density region , created as a result of the compression of the plasma , is clearly visible at the top of the circular cylinder .",
    "this is for the case where the higher order terms were used , i.e. the distribution shown is from equation [ dendist ] .",
    "as it is not possible to directly confirm the effectiveness of this method for determining the plasma @xmath1 of a prominence , it is important to apply it to simulations results to provide some validation .",
    "we apply it to the results of @xcite and @xcite , where a full description of the simulations are presented . in this section",
    "we apply equation [ dendist ] to solve the forward problem , i.e. we use the parameters of the simulation - including the plasma @xmath1 - to see how well the density distribution around the plume head can be reproduced .",
    "the simulation used in this paper is of the 3d magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability in the kippenhahn - schlter prominence model . to destabilise the kippenhahn - schlter prominence model , a low density tube ( density of 30% of the prominence )",
    "was placed inside the model .",
    "the boundary between this tube and the dense material was subjected to a random velocity perturbation allowing the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability to develop .",
    "a 3d rendering of the initial conditions of this simulation are shown in figure [ init ] .        in this study ,",
    "3d conservative ideal mhd equations were used .",
    "constant gravitational acceleration was assumed , but viscosity , diffusion , heat conduction and radiative cooling terms were neglected and an ideal gas was assumed .",
    "the equations were non - dimensionalised using the sound speed ( @xmath62kms@xmath14 ) , the pressure scale height ( @xmath63 cm ) , the density at the centre of the prominence ( @xmath64 g @xmath65 and the temperature ( @xmath66k ) , giving a characteristic timescale of @xmath67s .",

    "a full description of the simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "panel ( a ) of figure [ plumerise ] shows the density distribution at the centre of the the kippenhahn - schlter model as the rising plumes , created by the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability move upward through the dense prominence material .",
    "the plume in the box , more like a bubble in this image but really a low - density tube , is the plume we use for this comparison .",
    "note that we did nt have to choose a plume that has detached from its tail , as we are only interested in the density at the head of the plume .",
    ".,height=302 ]    panel ( b ) of figure [ plumerise ] shows the time - distance plot taken along the slit in panel ( a ) .",
    "the constant rise velocity of the plumes , resulting from the force balance created at the head of the plume , is clearly shown @xcite .",
    "the rise velocity of the topmost plume was found to have a mach number of @xmath70 .",
    "we use the free - stream mach number because if we transform the plume head to 0-velocity rest frame then the rise velocity transforms to a free - stream velocity of the dense material .",
    "it can be instantly noticed in figure [ plumerise ] that the plume is not perfectly circular .",
    "the first step of the transform is to change the coordinate size so that the size of the elliptical bubble is that of a unit ellipse ( i.e. the area of the ellipse is @xmath71 ) .",
    "this is achieved by dividing the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axis by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the minor axis of the ellipse and @xmath74 is the major axis of the ellipse .",
    "a second transform needs to be performed to transform the unit ellipse to a unit circle .",
    "this is achieved by multiplying the @xmath25 axis by @xmath75 and the @xmath24 axis by @xmath76 .",
    "this process is shown in figure [ transform ] .",

    "the mach number of the rising flow is shown in figure [ plumerise ] to be @xmath78 .",
    "the density distribution needs to take in mass conservation , so the column density ( integrating in the x - direction ) needs to be used .",
    "we calculate the average density over @xmath79-@xmath80 , where x is the direction of the horizontal magnetic field in the simulation domain . in a similar method to determining the density distribution , the average plasma @xmath1",
    "is calculated in the same way , giving @xmath81 .",
    "the ratio of specific heats ( @xmath82 ) was taken as @xmath68 for the simulations presented here .",
    "the next important step is to determine the background values .",
    "we determine the background density profile as the density profile at the same height at the dashed line along the left - hand edge of figure [ avden ] .",
    "this is then removed from the distribution above the head of the plume to show the density increase due to the compression by the rising plume .",
    "finally the background distribution , required to normalise the density distribution , is calculated from the average distribution ( over @xmath83 $ ] ) as @xmath84 .",
    "one final point to note is that the background distribution has a weak upflow ( mach number @xmath85 ) that needs to be included in the calculation to move the rising plume into a stationary reference frame with a free stream mach number of @xmath86 .",
    "it is important to note that because the frame of reference is changed , this free stream mach number is considered as the mach number of the flow toward a stationary plume head .",
    "figure [ avden ] shows the density profile of the simulation at the head of the plume , with contours from the predicted distribution to highlight the expected distribution .",
    "the high density region at the head of the plume and the rarefied regions at the sides of match well between the predicted and simulated densities .    .",
    "the background distribution has been removed.,height=302 ]    next we compare the velocity distribution at the plume head with the distribution predicted by equations [ vr ] and [ vthe ] .",
    "figure [ plumeheadvel ] shows the predicted distributions ( solid line ) and the simulated distributions ( dashed line ) for the vertical and horizontal velocity .",
    "the horizontal scale uses the same scale as that of figure [ transform ] , but centers the zero position at the plume head .",
    "the velocity distributions are in general good agreement .",
    "it should be noted that the velocities are multiplied by a factor of @xmath87 to give the correct magnitude of the velocity ( i.e. the maximum value of @xmath88 ) .",
    "note the good agreement in the velocity field even though the circular solution has been modified to apply to an elliptical body .",

    "this further , we can fit the density distribution using equation [ dendist ] and solve for @xmath90 .",
    "this , in turn , will make it possible to determine the value of the plasma @xmath1 .",
    "the method is explained in greater detail in the next section .",
    "the fit for the density distribution gives @xmath91 , which gives a plasma @xmath1 of @xmath92 when solving for the unknown ( i.e. @xmath1 ) in equation [ meqn ] .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the input value , but sufficiently close to show that the method can estimate the plasma @xmath1 using the compression of the plume .",
    "figure [ chisqu ] shows the chi - squared for the density distribution for models using different plasma @xmath1 values and the simulated distribution . the minimum of the @xmath93 distribution at a @xmath1 value that is close the value of plasma @xmath1 in the simulation .",

    "in this section we apply the method presented above to determine the plasma @xmath1 of the plume displayed in figure [ prom ] . in contrast to section [ sim ] ,",
    "this is treated as an inverse problem , where using the intensity and rise velocity allows the plasma @xmath1 of the prominence to be deduced .",
    "due to the timescales of these compressions ( @xmath94s ) being shorter than the timescales for the cooling ( @xmath95s ) , we can assume to first - order approximation that the increased intensity comes through purely adiabatic effects .",
    "these adiabatic effects would be an increased column density and a temperature rise from the compression .",
    "both of these can be calculated from the model described above .",

    "this has important implications relating to which plumes this mechanism can be accurately applied .",
    "it is clear from table [ gam_table ] that @xmath82 presents the biggest uncertainty relating to the value of the plasma @xmath1 of the prominence .",

    "we can at least be confident that the heating will not move the prominence plasma out of the observable temperature range , as the temperature increase is given as @xmath124 when @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , an increase of the density of @xmath125 ( which is approximately what we find in this paper ) , would increase the temperature from @xmath126k to @xmath127k which is still in the emission range for ca ii h @xmath128-@xmath127k so would not move the emission out of the passband .",
    "a model of the intensity change due to the increase in temperature under these conditions would increase the accuracy of the calculation from plasma @xmath1 .",
    "the value for plasma @xmath1 found here has a strong dependence on the hydrodynamic mach number as the values found were not small enough to make it unimportant .",
    "therefore , if downflows of prominence material interact with the head of the plume , they would increase the @xmath121 , which would reduce the value of the plasma @xmath1 . in section [ mach ]",
    "we assume a static prominence , but if we use a prominence background where the material is falling at sound - speed ( based on the downflows observed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can calculate a new value for the plasma @xmath1 of @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "figure [ timedist ] does not show any obvious downflows interacting with the head of the plume , so the assumption of @xmath131kms@xmath14 downflows is probably a huge over estimate , but this calculation is shown to highlight the potential importance of downflows when using this method to calculate the plasma @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , when downflows are not included in a calculation , as is the case in this paper , then the plasma @xmath1 value should always be viewed as an upper limit .",
    "another point that should be noted is the assumption of an irrotational flow as used in equation [ irrot ] .",
    "the most important point is that the plume is rising through the prominence material , pushing it out of the way as it rises . in a compressible medium with finite reynolds number",
    ", the downstream flow ( flow behind the plume head ) would develop turbulence and a wake , breaking the irrotational assumption .",
    "however , the compression that is being modelled is at the head of the plume , where the flows are much less complex .",
    "there are also observations that suggest prominences are weakly turbulent @xcite , which would imply that to a some extent the irrotational assumption is also broken upstream of the plume . but it can be expected that to first order the properties of the mean flow are not affected by the turbulence , but the turbulence would be modified by the mean flow potentially changing the characteristics of the turbulence downstream of the plume head , i.e. turbulence distortion . to summarise , the assumption used is broken downstream , but holds to first order in the area we are interested in . therefore ,",
    "even though we could nt use this to describe all the flows associated with the prominence plumes , it does apply for the area that is of interest allowing the plasma @xmath1 to be determined .",
    "one interesting point to note is that we have equations that define the velocity around the plume head , as analysed in figure [ plumeheadvel ] .",
    "therefore , analysis of the velocities at the observed plume head ( either through doppler shift analysis or the cork - tracking used in @xcite and @xcite will allow the projection of the plume on the plane - of - sky to be determined .",
    "this would be important as it would remove some uncertainty in the width of the plume head , making the parameters of the fitted ellipse more accurate . with this information",
    ", it should be possible to determine the prominence s",
    "plasma @xmath1 with greater confidence and also , through application of knowledge of the 3d magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability , estimate the direction of the magnetic field in the prominence .",
    "we plan to present this work in a future paper .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite studied a similar geometry through numerical simulations to investigate the movement of a magnetic cloud through a magnetised atmosphere in relation to cme propagation .",
    "therefore , the method presented in this paper may be applicable to more mhd phenomena than just prominences , an investigation into what phenomenon this can be applied to may open up some very rewarding research areas .",
