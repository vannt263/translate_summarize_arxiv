    "a total coloring of a graph @xmath2 is an assignment of colors to the vertices and edges of @xmath2 such that every pair of adjacent / incident elements receive different colors .",
    "a @xmath3-total coloring of a graph @xmath2 is a total coloring of @xmath2 from a set of @xmath3 colors .",
    "the minimum positive integer @xmath3 for which @xmath2 has a @xmath3-total coloring , denoted by @xmath4 , is called the total chromatic number of @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath5 for any graph @xmath2 by looking at the color of a vertex with maximum degree and its incident edges .",
    "the next step is to look for a brooks - typed or vizing - typed upper bound on the total chromatic number in terms of maximum degree .",
    "it turns out that the total coloring version of maximum degree upper bound is a difficult problem and has eluded mathematicians for nearly 50 years .",
    "the most well - known speculation is the total coloring conjecture , independently raised by behzad @xcite and vizing @xcite , which asserts that every graph of maximum degree @xmath6 admits a @xmath7-total coloring .",
    "this conjecture remains open , however , many beautiful results concerning it have been obtained ( cf .",
    "in particular , the total chromatic number of all outerplanar graphs has been determined completely by zhang et al .",
    "@xcite and that of all series - parallel graphs @xcite has been determined completely by wu and hu @xcite .",
    "a graph is pseudo - outerplanar if each of its blocks has an embedding in the plane so that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside the disk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another .",
    "for example , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are both pseudo - outerplanar graphs .",
    "this notion was introduced by zhang , liu and wu in @xcite , where the edge - decomposition of pseudo - outerplanar graphs into forests with a specified property was studied . in this paper , we prove that the total chromatic number of every pseudo - outerplanar graph with maximum degree @xmath0 is exactly @xmath1 and thus the total coloring conjecture holds for all pseudo - outerplanar graphs .",
    "to begin with , let us review an useful structural property of pseudo - outerplanar graphs which was proved in @xcite .",
    "we shall prove the theorem by induction on @xmath31 .",
    "so we assume that @xmath2 is 2-connected and thus @xmath32 .",
    "set @xmath33 . in the next ,",
    "we complete the proof by verifying the following four claims ; they imply a contradiction to lemma [ struc ] .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that @xmath36 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath37 . by induction",
    ", @xmath38 has an @xmath39-total coloring @xmath40 .",
    "denote the other neighbor of @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "now erase the color on @xmath41 and color the edge @xmath11 with @xmath43 .",
    "this is possible since @xmath44 .",
    "denote the extended coloring at this stage still by @xmath40 .",
    "then at last we color @xmath41 with @xmath45 , which is also possible since @xmath46 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath48 admits an @xmath39-total coloring by induction and every edge of the 4-cycle has at least two available colors since it is incident with at most @xmath49 colored elements .",
    "this implies that one can extend the coloring of @xmath38 to the four edges @xmath50 and @xmath51 since every 4-cycle is 2-edge - choosable . at last ,",
    "the two vertices @xmath41 and @xmath52 can be easily colored since they are both of degree two .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that @xmath2 contains such a 4-cycle .",
    "we consider the graph @xmath37 that has an @xmath39-total coloring @xmath40 by induction .",
    "one can find that the only obstacle of extending @xmath40 to @xmath11 is the case when @xmath54 and @xmath55 . without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 . if @xmath58 , then we recolor @xmath41 by 4 ( note that @xmath59 ) and then color @xmath11 by 5 .",
    "so we assume @xmath60 .",
    "similarly we can prove @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we can recolor @xmath52 by 1 and then color @xmath11 by 6 , a contradiction .",
    "suppose , to the contrary , that @xmath2 contains such a 7-path .",
    "we consider the graph @xmath62 , which admits an @xmath39-total coloring @xmath40 by induction .",
    "denote by @xmath63 the set of available colors to properly color an edge @xmath64 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath65 and @xmath66 , moreover , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 , without loss of generality assume that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then color @xmath72 with 1 and @xmath73 with @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath74 , then color @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 with 1 .",
    "if @xmath78 , then color @xmath77 with @xmath79 and @xmath75 with @xmath80 .",
    "in each case we have @xmath81 .",
    "thus we can color @xmath51 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 with @xmath84 such that @xmath85 . at this stage ,",
    "the three vertices @xmath86 and @xmath42 can be easily colored since they are all of degree two .",
    "so we assume that @xmath87 .",
    "now we firstly color @xmath72 and @xmath73 by 1 .",
    "if @xmath78 , then color @xmath77 with @xmath88 and @xmath75 with @xmath80 .",
    "the current extended coloring satisfies that @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we can color the remaining elements similarly as before .",
    "so we assume that @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 and thus we can exchange the colors on @xmath72 and @xmath90 . by doing",
    "so we obtain a new coloring satisfying @xmath91 and therefore we can extend this partial coloring to @xmath2 by a same argument as above .",
    "the graph ( a ) in figure [ fig ] is a pseudo - outerplanar graph , since it has a pseudo - outerplanar drawing as ( b ) .",
    "one can easy to check that it is a graph with maximum degree 3 and total chromatic number 5 .",
    "thus the upper bound for @xmath6 in corollary [ main ] , although probably not the best possible , can not be less than 4 ."
