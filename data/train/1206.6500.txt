    "although far less common than low - mass stars , massive stars play a key role in the evolution of the energetics and chemistry of molecular clouds and galaxies .",
    "however , the formation of high - mass stars is far less clear than their low - mass counterparts for several reasons .",
    "massive stars are rare and evolve quickly .",
    "in addition , the regions that host their early stages of formation are difficult to observe due to high dust extinction , and , with a few exceptions , are located at large distances ( @xmath4 3 kpc ) . for this reason , most of the research on massive star formation has been based on observations of regions with current star formation ( e.g. , `` hot cores , ''  regions ) , which were initially easier to detect in surveys and to follow up in detail . in constrast ,",
    "objects in the earlier `` prestellar '' or `` starless '' stage have been much harder to find and , in consequence , this stage still remains poorly understood .    about a decade ago , however , the regions containing the earliest stages of massive star formation were identified .",
    "galactic plane surveys revealed thousands of dark patches obscuring the bright mid - infrared background ( _ iso _ , @xcite ; _ msx _ , @xcite , @xcite ; _ spitzer _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these dark silhouettes were associated with molecular and dust emission , indicating they consist of dense molecular gas .",
    "such objects were called infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) .",
    "the first studies characterizing them suggested that they were cold ( @xmath525 k ) , massive ( @xmath610@xmath710@xmath8 ) , and dense ( @xmath410@xmath9 @xmath10 ) molecular clouds with high column densities ( @xmath410@xmath11 @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "they also correspond to the densest clouds embedded within giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "more recent studies on irdc clumps,1 pc and a mass @xmath610@xmath710@xmath13 .",
    "we use the term `` core '' to describe a compact , dense object within a clump with a size @xmath140.1 pc and a mass @xmath1450 . ]",
    "using dust continuum emission , show that they have typical masses of @xmath6120  and sizes @xmath60.5 pc @xcite .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of several irdc clumps reveal dust temperatures that range between 16 and 52 k , and luminosities that range from @xmath61010@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "temperatures derived using nh@xmath3 observations are lower than dust temperatures and range from @xmath61020 k @xcite .",
    "star formation activity in irdc clumps can be inferred from high temperatures and high luminosities as well as the presence of uc  regions @xcite , hot cores @xcite , embedded 24 @xmath16 m sources @xcite , molecular outflows @xcite , and maser emission @xcite .",
    "the high masses , densities , and column densities of the irdc clumps , as well as the aforementioned signatures of star formation in them , indicate that irdcs are currently forming massive stars .",
    "in addition , irdcs harbor numerous candidates for the most elusive earliest phase of high - mass star formation , the `` prestellar '' or `` starless '' phase @xcite . due to the characteristics of irdcs and the large variety of evolutionary stages that they harbor , it has been suggested that they are the natal sites of all massive stars and stellar clusters @xcite .    with the aim of characterizing the different evolutionary stages of clumps found in irdcs ,",
    "@xcite proposed an evolutionary sequence in which `` quiescent '' clumps evolve into `` intermediate '' , `` active '' , and `` red '' clumps .",
    "this evolutionary scheme is based on the _",
    "spitzer_/irac 3 - 8 @xmath16 m colors and the presence or absence of _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24 @xmath16 m point - source emission .",
    "a clump is called `` quiescent '' if it contains no ir-_spitzer _ emission ( it is ir - dark ) ; `` intermediate '' if it contains either an enhanced 4.5 @xmath16 m emission , the so - called `` green fuzzies '' ( also known as extended green objects ( egos ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a 24 @xmath16 m source , but not both ; `` active '' if it is associated with a green fuzzy and an embedded 24 @xmath16 m source ; and `` red '' if it is associated with bright 8 @xmath16 m emission , which likely corresponds to an  region .",
    "quiescent clumps are the best candidates to be in the `` prestellar '' or `` starless '' phase , and the massive quiescent clumps are the places where it is most probable that high - mass stars are in their earliest stages of evolution .",
    "an additional category is `` blue , '' which describes objects with bright 3.6 @xmath16 m emission that are predominantly unextincted stars .",
    "although several properties of irdcs have been determined in the last few years , there is still one that remains poorly explored , their chemistry .",
    "what is the chemistry in irdc clumps ?",
    "are the evolutionary stages defined by @xcite chemically distinguishable ? presently , only a few studies have focused on this subject @xcite .    in this paper , we report initial results from a program aimed at better understanding the chemical evolution of irdc clumps , carrying out a multi - line survey at 3 mm .",
    "we observed several molecular lines simultaneously , which facilitates comparison between different lines by eliminating or reducing observational errors arising from uncertainties in telescope pointing and calibrations .",
    "the main goals of this project are to investigate the behavior of the different molecular tracers and look for observable changes in the chemistry as a function of the evolutionary stages proposed by @xcite .",

    "we made single - pointing observations of molecular lines at 3 mm using the atnf mopra 22 m telescope located in australia .",
    "the source list comprises 37 irdcs , containing a total of 159 clumps .",
    "this is a sub - sample of the 38 irdcs and 190 clumps identified by @xcite using 1.2 mm dust continuum emission at 11  angular resolution .",
    "the threshold limit for a molecular line to be considered as a detection was defined at the 3@xmath25 level , where @xmath25 is the rms noise in antenna temperature ( @xmath26 ; see table  [ tbl - obsparam ] ) . the clumps g015.31 mm4 , g027.75 mm5 , g028.37 mm5 , and g030.57 mm4 present no molecular line emission above the 3@xmath25 detection level ; consequently , they are not included in any analysis throughout this work .",
    "we excluded 17 clumps that show signs of star formation at ir wavelengths ( _ spitzer _ ) and are located at a different distance than the rest of the clumps within an irdc ( see section  [ kinematic ] for more details ) .",
    "these clumps belong to a different molecular cloud that is situated in the line of sight .",
    "since the mopra telescope beam size ( 38 ) is sometimes comparable to the separation between clumps within the same irdc , @xmath630% of the sources are contaminated by emission from another adjacent clump . to ensure that the observed emission is attributable solely to a single clump , and not a neighboring clump , each source with an angular separation smaller than the mopra beam size from its nearest neighbor",
    "was excluded .",
    "furthermore , blue clumps are not included in any analysis because they are likely unextincted stars .",
    "therefore , this work will focus on the remaining 92 irdc clumps unless stated otherwise . @xcite and @xcite classified the initial sample of 190 irdc clumps using a combination of _",
    "spitzer_/irac colors and the presence or absence of compact 24 @xmath16 m emission .",
    "their classifications differ in the method of estimating the 24 @xmath16 m flux measurements .",

    "24 @xmath16 m emission is detected for a particular source using one method , but not the other . in this work , to avoid ambiguities , if a clump presents 24 @xmath16 m emission from either of the two methods , a 24 @xmath16 m compact source will be assigned to the clump .",

    "august and 2010 september .",
    "they were performed with the 3 mm monolithic microwave integrated circuits ( mmic ) receiver and the mopra spectrometer ( mops ) in the `` broad - band '' mode , resulting in a total bandwidth of 8.3 ghz split over four overlapping sub - bands of 2.2 ghz .",

    "we identify three reasons that may explain why hco@xmath1 and hnc do not present a similar trend to that one shown by n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "first , the hco@xmath1 and hnc lines are optically thick ( see section  [ opacity ] ) and consequently , the line widths can be broadened by opacity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the hco@xmath1 line can show broadening and wing emission produced by molecular outflow activity .",
    "certainly , this is what is happening in g018.82 mm3 , which has a @xmath41v of 13.0   in the hco@xmath1 line .",
    "finally , because the mopra beam is @xmath638  ( 0.8 pc at the average distance of 4.3 kpc ) , we are observing the bulk motions of the gas and some level of clumping may also be present .",
    "this also could explain why the trend of broader n@xmath0h@xmath1 lines toward more evolved objects is not as clear as we expect .",
    "however , since n@xmath0h@xmath1 is thought to be a higher density tracer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "second , the large beam of mopra is including emission from cold gas which is sorrounding the most compact regions directly associated with the star formation processes in the center of the clumps .",
    "if most of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is coming from a cold envelope , in clumps that show signs of star formation , we are using in the abundance calculation a higher temperature than the actual value .",
    "higher temperatures would lead us to infer larger n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances .",
    "@xcite performed a time - dependent chemical modeling of the massive protostellar cluster afgl5142 based on the model of @xcite .",
    "their model consists of a prestellar and a protostellar phase . from their figure  9",
    ", it can be seen that once temperature increases , from the prestellar to the protostellar phase , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 molecular abundance also increases , supporting what we see in our work .",
    "hco@xmath1 has been widely used to investigate infall motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , occasionally , its spectrum shows high - velocity wing emission which indicates outflow activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this makes hco@xmath1 a good tracer of kinematics in star - forming regions . on the other hand ,",
    "h@xmath2co@xmath1 is optically thin and normally shows a gaussian profile . the combination of these two lines is usually used to distinguish between an asymmetric `` blue profile '' ( indicative of infall motions ) and two velocity components in the line of sight . if the optically thin h@xmath2co@xmath1 peaks in the self - absorption of the optically thick hco@xmath1 , it indicates a genuine `` blue profile . '' in our sample of irdc clumps , three intermediate clumps ( g024.33 mm2 , g024.33 mm5 , and g031.97 mm5 ) present this characteristic profile associated with large - scale infall motions . as",
    "also happpens for n@xmath0h@xmath1 , hco@xmath1 column densities and abundances rise with the evolution of the clumps . as we mentioned before for n@xmath0h@xmath1 ,",
    "the increase in hco@xmath1 column densities might be due to the physical evolution of the clumps .",
    "the rise in hco@xmath1 abundance can be plausibly explained by the increase in the temperature , which releases co from grain mantles into the gas phase , forming more hco@xmath1 with the passage of time .",
    "for example , although @xcite focused on the nh@xmath3/n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance ratio , they also obtained hco@xmath1 abundances from their chemical modeling .",
    "they showed that once temperature rises , from the prestellar to the protostellar phase , the hco@xmath1 molecular abundance rises , as well as that of n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",

    "we note that c@xmath0h lines show the best @xmath41v correlation with n@xmath0h@xmath1 , suggesting that the emission originates from the same region ( see figure  [ fwhm - plot ] ) .",

    "the formation of hnco is inefficient if only gas - phase reactions are considered @xcite . in hot cores , the gas formation chemistry can explain the observed hnco abundances when reactions on the surfaces of grains are included .",

    "@xcite found hnco lines that exhibit the same characteristics as other well - known shock tracers such as ch@xmath3oh and some sulfur - bearing species ( so and so@xmath0 ) .",
    "these authors suggest that hnco is a shock tracer which is explained by a combination of grain surface and gas phase chemistry .",
    "hnco abundances would rise in shock regions because this molecule can be directly ejected to the gas phase through grain sputtering and because the efficiency of neutral - neutral reactions increases in the gas phase due to higher gas temperatures .    in our irdc sample ,",
    "hnco emission is detected slightly more often in regions with signs of star formation .",
    "the hnco line widths seem to correlate with those of n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",

    "the hnco spectrum presents a blue wing which is also observed in sio .",
    "hnco column densities rise with the evolution of the clumps , as is shown by the median values .",
    "however , hnco abundances do not show this trend .",
    "it is well - known that sio is a powerful tracer of molecular gas associated with shocks @xcite .",
    "its abundance is highly enhanced in molecular outflows , with respect to the ambient abundances . in some cases these enhancements",
    "can be up to @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "the increase of the sio abundance is due to the silicate grain destruction , giving rise to the injection into gas of si atoms and/or si - bearing species , and the subsequent high temperature gas - phase chemistry @xcite .",
    "the previous sio production mechanism explains spectral lines that show extended wing emission with broad line widths caused by the interaction of outflows and the surrounding medium .",
    "however , an sio component coming from quiescent gas is not well understood .",
    "@xcite detected extended narrow sio emission not associated with signs of star formation in an irdc .",
    "they suggest that this sio component could be produced by the following processes : remnants of large - scale shocks caused by the formation process of the irdc , decelerated shocked gas associated with large scale outflows from neighboring massive protostars , recently processed material associated with the youngest jets / outflows , and/or an undetected and widespread lower mass protostar population .    in our irdc sample ,",
    "sio emission is mostly detected in clumps with signs of star formation .",
    "the only exception is the quiescent clump g024.33 mm7 which shows a narrow line profile ( 1.4 ) and the lowest sio abundance in the sample .",

    ", we base our study on 92 sources .",
    "hnc and n@xmath0h@xmath1 lines are detected in almost every irdc clumps at every evolutionary stage , indicating that their presence does not depend on the star formation activity .",
    "on the other hand , hc@xmath3n , hnco , and sio lines are predominantly detected in later stages of evolution , as expected from their formation paths .",
    "the line widths of n@xmath0h@xmath1 slightly increase with the evolution of the clumps , which is likely produced by the rise of turbulence due to the enhancement of the star formation activity at later evolutionary stages .",
    "the increase is modest because , due to the large mopra beam , we are also tracing the bulk motions of the gas , instead of just the densest regions associated with star formation .",
    "optical depth calculations show that the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line is mostly optically thin ( median of 0.8 ) and the c@xmath0h line is moderately optically thick ( median of 2.4 ) .",
    "hco@xmath1 and hnc lines are optically thick ( medians of 21 and 19 , respectively ) , while their isotopologues are optically thin ( median of 0.4 for both ) .",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 opacities show no variations with the evolution of the clumps , whereas c@xmath0h , hco@xmath1 and hnc show a slight decrease with the rise of star formation activity",
    ".    in general , column densities of the different molecules change for the different evolutionary stages defined by @xcite and increase with the evolution of the clumps , with the exception of c@xmath0h .",
    "however , this is not generally true for molecular abundances ( i.e. , after dividing by the total h@xmath0 column density inferred from 1.2 mm continuum emission ) . only the increases of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 abundances are statistically significant and reflect chemical evolution .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who included both molecules in their chemical modeling of a massive star - forming region .",
    "although it is expected a rise of the hco@xmath1 abundance with the evolution of the clumps , it is not clear why n@xmath0h@xmath1 also follows this trend .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath98/hco@xmath1 abundance ratio acts as a chemical clock , increasing its value from intermediate to active and red clumps .",
    "this observed trend is consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the chemical models suggest that when clumps warm up , they release co from grain mantles to the gas phase .",
    "this rise of co increases the amount of hco@xmath1 , because co is its main supplier , with respect to n@xmath0h@xmath1 , because co is its main destroyer .",
    "however , the observed trend does not extend to quiescent clumps .",
    "this could be due to observational limitations or because the theoretical predictions are incorrect at very early stages of evolution .",
    "we also find that the n@xmath0h@xmath98/hnc abundance ratio increases with the evolution of the clumps , from quiescent to red clumps .",
    "it is not clear why this ratio behaves in this way , but it suggests that hnc may be preferentially formed in cold gas .    j.m.j . gratefully acknowledges funding support from nsf grant no .",

    "<S> we have observed 37 infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , containing a total of 159 clumps , in high - density molecular tracers at 3 mm using the 22-meter atnf mopra telescope located in australia . after determining kinematic distances , we eliminated clumps that are not located in irdcs and clumps with a separation between them of less than one mopra beam . </S>",
    "<S> our final sample consists of 92 irdc clumps . </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly detected molecular lines are ( detection rates higher than 8% ) : n@xmath0h@xmath1 , hnc , hn@xmath2c , hco@xmath1 , h@xmath2co@xmath1 , hcn , c@xmath0h , hc@xmath3n , hnco , and sio . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the behavior of the different molecular tracers and look for chemical variations as a function of an evolutionary sequence based on _ spitzer _ irac and mips emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the molecular tracers behave differently through the evolutionary sequence and some of them can be used to yield useful relative age information . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of hnc and n@xmath0h@xmath1 lines do not depend on the star formation activity . on the other hand , hc@xmath3n , hnco , and sio </S>",
    "<S> are predominantly detected in later stages of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> optical depth calculations show that in irdc clumps the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line is optically thin , the c@xmath0h line is moderately optically thick , and hnc and hco@xmath1 are optically thick . </S>",
    "<S> the hcn hyperfine transitions are blended , and , in addition , show self - absorbed line profiles and extended wing emission . </S>",
    "<S> these factors combined prevent the use of hcn hyperfine transitions for the calculation of physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> total column densities of the different molecules , except c@xmath0h , increase with the evolutionary stage of the clumps . </S>",
    "<S> molecular abundances increase with the evolutionary stage for n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the n@xmath0h@xmath1/hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1/hnc abudance ratios act as chemical clocks , increasing with the evolution of the clumps . </S>"
