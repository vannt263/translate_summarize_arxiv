    "despite the success of the standard model ( sm ) , the scalar sector still suffers from the quadratic divergence .",
    "one possible solution to that is to introduce a new kind of symmetry , which handles these divergences and reduces to merely logarithmic .",
    "this theory is called supersymmetry and it gives an explanation for the strong and electroweak interactions at the planck scale down to the weak scale . according to the theory , if r - parity is conserved in the decay of the supersymmetric particles , the lightest supersymmetric particle becomes a typical candidate for the weakly - interacting dark matter@xcite .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle in the theory is called neutralino ( @xmath1 ) and due to the weakly interacting nature it will escape the detector without leaving any signal .",
    "however , it could be tracked via the missing energy in each event .",
    "the lhc collider at cern provided pp collisions at @xmath2 ( lhc7 ) and @xmath3 ( lhc8 ) in run-1 to the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "these experiments excluded a very favorable model known as cmssm for the following cases @xcite ; i. ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and ii . ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to that , if the discovered higgs boson emerges to be the supersymmetric light cp - even higgs boson , gauge and anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking models will also be ruled out .    in this work ,",
    "the neutralino pair production including whole set of all possible one - loop level feynman diagrams are calculated .",
    "the numerical calculation is presented for the _ s - tau coannihilation _ scenario ( stc ) which is proposed in the light of lhc7 and lhc8 results @xcite .",
    "the masses of neutralinos and charginos in this benchmark point are at the sub - tev range , which makes them accessible at the ilc in @xmath8 collision mode .",
    "therefore , this benchmark point is outside of the limits presented by the whole lhc program and it could be reached at the ilc , as it is concluded in this work .",
    "the total cross section as a function of center - of - mass ( cm ) energy for the neutralino pairs and the angular distribution of the cross section are calculated for the unpolarized photon - collisions .",
    "in addition to these , the total integrated cross section is calculated for @xmath9 cm energies .",
    "the process for the neutralino pair production at the nlo via photon - photon collision is denoted as @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 are the four - momenta of the incoming photons and outgoing neutralinos , respectively . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the polarization vectors of the incoming photons . since photon does nt couple to itself , the neutralino pair production via photon - photon collision is possible via loops at the lowest .",
    "all the feynman diagrams contributing to the process @xmath15 at the one - loop level are given in @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the process @xmath16 have been performed using the following packages ; ` feynarts`@xcite to generate the feynman diagrams and the corresponding amplitudes , ` formcalc`@xcite to simplify the fermion chains then square the corresponding amplitudes and ` looptools`@xcite to evaluate the scalar and tensor one - loop integrals .",
    "there is no ultraviolet divergence in the results , because all the possible one loop level diagrams are taken into account .",
    "the corresponding lorentz invariant matrix element for the one - loop level process is written as a sum over box - dagrams , triangle - diagrams , bubble s - channel type and quartic ones are showed in @xcite , @xmath17    in the numerical calculation , the scattering amplitude is evaluated in the cm frame , then the polarization vectors of the incoming photons and the helicities of the neutralinos are summed . as a result , the cross section of the unpolarized photon collisions is given as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is calculated for the outgoing neutralino pairs .",
    "the photon beam at the ilc is formed using the laser back - scattering technique on electron beam in @xmath20 collisions .",
    "therefore , the big fraction of the cm energy of the electron beam could be transferred to the photon collisions .",
    "then , the @xmath21 process could be taken as a subprocess in the @xmath20 collisions .",
    "thus , the total cross section of @xmath22 could easily be calculated by convoluting the photonic cross section @xmath23 with the photon luminosity in @xmath20 collider .",
    "the total integrated photonic cross section is defined in the following equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the cm energy in @xmath20 collisions and @xmath8 subprocess , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the threshold energy for neutralino pair and defined as @xmath28 .",
    "the maximum fraction of the photon energy is taken as @xmath29 and the distribution function of the photon luminosity is given in @xcite .",
    "in this section , the total cross section as a function of cm energy , the angular distribution of the total cross section , and the total integrated photonic cross section for the @xmath30-coannihilation benchmark point are presented .",
    "the total integrated photonic cross section for each neutralino pairs are presented in table-[tab : a ] for two distinct cm energies ( @xmath31 ) .    in many constrained susy models ,",
    "the sfermion masses are correlated at a high energy scale and light sleptons with the mass of @xmath32 are not allowed . however , in a model like pmssm the spectra of the light sleptons and heavy squarks are possible due to the higher parameter freedom . in the pmssm ,",
    "the following parameters are taken @xcite ;    * higgs sector parameters : @xmath33 , @xmath34 * trilinear couplings : @xmath35 * gaugino mass parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 * slepton mass parameters : @xmath38 , @xmath39 * squark mass parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43    the sm parameters and the electroweak scale parameter set of the benchmark point are adopted from @xcite and ref .",

    "the mass spectrum of the neutral higgs bosons in stc are @xmath47 .",
    "the favor of this benchmark point is that it offers an adequate dark matter annihilation mechanism due to the light @xmath48 mass .    ,",

    "the energy dependence of the @xmath51 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 pairs in unpolarized photon collisions are given in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the cross section goes up to @xmath52 around @xmath53 for @xmath50 pair . therefore , the production rates are significantly lower around @xmath54 for the @xmath51 and @xmath49 pairs at cm energies higher than @xmath55 .",
    "however , the cross section is enhanced for the @xmath51 and @xmath49 pairs and it gets value up to @xmath56 due to the s - channel enhancement . when the cm energy of the incoming photons are close to the masses of the neutral @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 bosons , the s - channel resonance effect in the diagrams where neutral supersymmetric higgs bosons are intermediated enhances the cross section significantly .",

    "the peaks seen in the cross section distributions are due to resonance effect of the neutral higgs propagation particularly in the triangle type diagrams .",
    "the integrated total photonic cross section is calculated by convoluting the @xmath70 cross section with the photon luminosities at the ilc for two distinct cm energies of the incoming @xmath20 beams . among the results presented in @xcite and the one calculated in this work , the stc gives higher total integrated cross section for the same second lightest neutralino pairs after nuhm2 benchmark point at @xmath71 .",
    "pair production rate of the lightest neutralinos is quite lower than the other benchmark points analyzed in @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath67 pair production rate gets high at @xmath72 cm energy .",
    "the lightest neutralino pair without additional hard photon is not observable due to the weakly interacting nature , but the lightest and next - to - lightest neutralino pair is observable at the detector .",
    "this process is a primary interest in the current supersymmetry searches . for experimental point of view",
    "the lightest neutralino will produce a large missing energy in the collisions and production of missing energy with the asymmetry in the events will give a strong clue on supersymmetry in ilc .",
    "it is concluded that a @xmath8 collider with an additional very small cost compared to the @xmath20 collider could produce new results on supersymmetry and that might give hints on the beginning of the universe .",
