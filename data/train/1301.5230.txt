    "multiple protostellar systems ( mpss ) are common among every stage of protostellar evolution , but are tricky to decipher .",
    "fragmentation is believed to be the main mechanism for forming mpss @xcite , but how and when fragmentation occurs is still a major question . to constrain the fragmentation process , information about the system s multiplicity , coevality , environment and outflows are needed . since older systems have suffered dynamical evolution @xcite , young early stage mpss , having many of the initial conditions almost intact , are the best targets for the task . in this letter we present the results of our work on",
    "the much debated vla1623 , located in @xmath0 ophiuchus and generally considered the prototypical class 0 source ( @xcite , hereafter awb93 ) .",
    "first detected through red- and blueshifted overlapped outflows @xcite , vla1623 s multiplicity has long been suspected from observation of multiple continuum sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter lmw00 ) , outflow misalingment ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter yc97 ) and two discreet precessing jets originating from the same region @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the multiple continuum sources are argued to constitute a monopolar jet driven by vla1623a ( @xcite , hereafter ba97 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter moa12 ) .",
    "while vla1623a is agreed to be a real protostellar source , and was used by abw93 as the prime example to establish a new class of ysos -  class 0 \" , there is still debate on the nature of the other sources , mainly vla1623b ( @xcite , hereafter wkga11 ) .",
    "we present the results of our work to determine the multiplicity of vla1623 and disentangle its outflows . our own submillimeter array",
    "( sma ; @xcite ) observations and archival data were used , suplemented with data from literature .",
    "our results show vla1623 to be a triple non - coeval protostellar system and find vla1623b to be a bona - fide protostar with an extremely young age .",
    "we observed vla1623 with sma at 345ghz in the compact configuration for 8 hours on 2007 july 25 , with 2ghz correlator mode configured to observe @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) , c@xmath2o ( 3 - 2 ) and so ( 9 - 8 ) simultaneously with 870@xmath3 m continuum and polarization measurements .",
    "all windows were set to have 128 channels , providing a velocity resolution of 0.704kms@xmath4 .",
    "quasars 3c273 and 1733 - 130 were observed as the bandpass and gain calibrators .",
    "a planet was not observed for unknown operational reasons .",
    "this track s original purpose was polarization measurements , where lack of flux calibration is not a critical issue .",
    "we performed standard data reduction for polarization data using miriad .",

    "data imaging and analysis were performed with miriad using natural weighting resulting in a beamsize of 151@xmath5076 .",
    "we compared the two datasets by binning vectorially averaged amplitudes , and when the tracks overlap , the flux level was comparable .",

    "the 2009 data were presented by moa12 . here",
    "we redo the data reduction and analysis .",
    "the data quality of the 2007 data appears to be better than the 2009 data ; the system temperatures are 92@xmath624k and 130@xmath639k , and the atmospheric opacities are 0.06 and 0.1 for the 2007 and 2009 data , respectively .",

    ", the flux from the two datasets are consistent within 11% .",
    "miriad was used to separately calibrate each dataset and then combine during imaging assuming natural weighting in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in continuum and @xmath1co .",

    "b appears brighter than a possibly due to b being more compact than a and that much of the emission from a , present in the compact data , has been resolved out ( figure  [ figcont]c ) .",

    ". resolved fluxes and uncertainties for each component are listed in table  [ tball ] .",
    "we construct each component s sed using all available resolved fluxes from ba97 , lmw00 , wkga11 and our work ( table  [ tball ] ) .",
    "the source size in all literature are in the 1@xmath72@xmath11 range except in mips1 band ; therefore , the flux we used originates from similar spatial scales .",
    "the mips1 detections are point sources , so their large source size is due to poor resolution .",
    "fluxes between 24@xmath3m@xmath12@xmath13@xmath127 mm were fit by a single - temperature greybody fit with optical depth @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 .",

    "@xcite showed that incomplete seds lead to underestimated derived luminosities . to examine whether this affects a & w s classification ,",
    "we calculate the luminosities from the best fit sed curve including the area under the extrapolated curve , l@xmath29 , and then compare with the above derived luminosities ( table  [ tball ] ) .",
    "we find that l@xmath29 are higher than the derived luminosities , as predicted , however the ratios are consistent with the evolutionary classification previously obtained .      in figure  [ figout ]",
    ", we show vla1623 s outflows in @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) with a velocity range of -62kms@xmath4 and 415kms@xmath4 for the blueshifted and redshifted emission , respectively ( v@xmath30 = 3.8kms@xmath4 , yc97 ) . overlapped red- and blueshifted morphologies are observed in both transitions , as expected ( @xcite ; @xcite ; yc97 ) , however we observe several additional features not previously reported . in @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) the se lobe is collimated with overlapped emission throughout , whereas the nw lobe presents a forked structure with overlapped red- and blueshifted emission only in the southernmost branch . in @xmath1co ( 2 - 1 ) a slow blueshifted feature is located at w while a dim redshifted clumpy ouflow coincides with the northernmost branch of the nw lobe . in both transitions",
    "we observe a compact blueshifted knot elongated in the ne to sw direction and centered on b. the blueshifted knot presents a spatially overlapped redshifted counterpart only in @xmath1co ( 2 - 1 ) ( figure  [ figout ] ) .",
    "so spatially overlapped blueshifted ( -0.52.3kms@xmath4 ) and redshifted ( 57.2kms@xmath4 ) emission as well as a systemic velocity component ( 34.4kms@xmath4 ) and a southward blueshifted ridge are detected around a & b ( figure  [ figout ] ) . the so emission is probably tracing circumstellar material shocked by a & b s outflows",
    ".      observed c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o emission centered on a present an extended flattened structure perpendicular to the outflow axis ( figure  [ figenv ] ) , similar to a s shape in continuum .",
    "both emission show similar velocity gradients characteristic of rotation along the major axis , seen in both velocity gradient maps and position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams ( figure  [ figenv ] ) .",
    "no velocity gradient is observed along the outflow axis , suggesting contamination from outflows is neglible .",
    "c@xmath2o s dimensions ( fwhm 370au@xmath5240au ) are somewhat larger than a s 1.3 mm continuum dimensions ( 240au@xmath5120au ) .",
    "assuming centrally dominated motion , we overlay keplerian rotation curves ( v@xmath15r@xmath31 ) for central masses of 0.1 and 0.2m@xmath28 on the c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o pv diagrams . for comparison",
    "we overlay an infall curve v@xmath15r@xmath4 .",
    "although the infall curve passes through the peak of c@xmath8o , both emission are better traced by the keplerian rotation curves .",
    "this suggests that both molecules trace the same rotating disk - like structure , with c@xmath8o tracing the innermost region and c@xmath2o the outermost region of the structure due to different resolutions .",
    "though smaller , the characteristics of a s keplerian disk are similar to @xcite s class i keplerian disk , hinting at the beginnings of disk evolution .",
    "neither emission appears associated with b and no circumstellar material was detected towards w.",
    "from our sed fit of a we obtained t@xmath19=36k , higher than previously reported ( t@xmath19=1520k , awb93 ) . this discrepancy may be due to our fitting using only resolved fluxes tracing the inner hotter regions of the core instead of considering the surrounding colder regions , as was done in awb93 . despite the higher dust temperature , we find a to be a class 0 object based on lack of detection beyond 24@xmath3 m and l@xmath26/l@xmath25@xmath320.5% , in agreement with previous work .",
    "we do not consider the circumstellar - to - protostar - mass ratio as a criterion for evolutionary stage since we can not account for all of a s envelope mass from our observations .",
    "a presents a flattened elongated envelope structure perpendicular to the outflow direction traced in c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o ( figure  [ figenv ] ) as well as in continuum , most noticeable at 1.3 mm ( figure  [ figcont ] ) .",
    "both c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o present signatures of rotation that suggest pure keplerian rotation ( figure  [ figenv ] ) and provide an estimate for the central object mass of a to be 0.1 - 0.2m@xmath28 .",
    "both the envelope traced by c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o and the 1.3 mm continuum emission may be tracing a rotating disk about a , a possibility also raised by wkga11 .",
    "the presence of this rotating disk about a would be one of the first evidence of keplerian disks around class 0 protostars , however further analysis must be carried out to confirm whether this is indeed a keplerian disk .",
    "we find w to be a true protostar , based on detection in all irac and mips1 bands , as well as in the ( sub)millimeter and centimeter regimes .",
    "we are unable to analyze w s environment due to lack of detection of circumstellar material .",
    "given the lack of circumstellar material emission towards w and the small circumstellar mass m@xmath23 derived from the 1.3 mm continuum ( table  [ tball ] ) , we assume that w s m@xmath23 is less than the central object mass m@xmath33 .",
    "additionally , awb93 showed l@xmath34/l@xmath25@xmath350.5% to be equivalent to m@xmath36@xmath35m@xmath33 .",
    "hence , based on an infrared spectral index @xmath37@xmath38=1.68@xmath60.07 ( c2d catalogue ) , l@xmath26/l@xmath25=0.18% , m@xmath36@xmath35m@xmath39 and the class - i - shaped sed , we classify w as a class i source .",
    "@xcite mistook w as a+b due to their source identification criteria ; however , from the listed source position and @xmath37@xmath38 the source is w , even more so since a lacks infrared emission at @xmath13@xmath3524@xmath3 m . the fact that w is a protostellar source confirms the suspicions of @xcite and yc97 that the outflow and jet misalignments are caused by a second source .",
    "we find b to be an extremely cold ( t@xmath405k ) object with extremely low luminosity ( @xmath710@xmath27l@xmath28 ) .",
    "no associated c@xmath2o and c@xmath8o emission suggest strong co depletion , consistent with the derived extremely cold dust temperature ( co sublimation temperature @xmath720k ) .",
    "we further suspect that b may be driving a pole - on outflow ( see section  [ secout ] and figure  [ figout ] ) .",
    "while we can not determine b s nature unambiguously , some possibilities can be ruled out .",
    "@xcite show vla1623 s jet knots have gas temperatures of 17004200k and velocities between 60100kms@xmath4 .",
    "the strong co depletion at b indicates that the gas temperature is @xmath3520k , far below that expected for jet knots .",
    "observations of monopolar continuum jet knots in t tauri stars @xcite show obvious shifts in the knot positions in short periods of time . assuming simple ballistic motion and velocities of 60100kms@xmath4",
    ", b should have shifted from ba97 s initially reported position by @xmath723@xmath11 in a period of 15 years .",
    "however , comparison of ba97 s and our 2012 observations show no such shift .",
    "vla high resolution ( @xmath705 ) centimeter continuum observations of jet - driving class 0 and i objects @xcite found most detected continuum peaks to be protostellar sources with continuum jets seen as extended emission in the direction of the source s outflow / jet .",
    "b is observed as a separate compact component and is coincident with counterparts in the ( sub)millimeter regimes , making it more like a yso and less like a jet knot .",
    "although vla1623 s alignment and distribution might resemble a jet , several mpss are observed to have their components either aligned or within their companion s outflow ( e.g. ngc1333 svs13 : @xcite ; l1448 c : @xcite ) , possibly caused by filament fragmentation . thus vla1623 s configuration is not highly unlikely .",
    "furthermore , a quick jeans mass calculation shows that given b s mass , dust temperature and density , the core is unstable and most likely collapsing .",
    "hence even if it were product of outflow - environment interaction it is on its way to becoming a yso .",
    "thus , b can not be a jet / outflow feature as proposed by moa12 .",
    "other possibilities for the nature of b are a starless core or proto - brown dwarf . while the co depletion and extremely low temperature and luminosity are characteristics of starless cores @xcite , the mass , density and presence of outflow rule out the possibility of b being a starless core .",
    "if we assume a star formation efficiency of 30% the resulting object from b would be a @xmath70.1m@xmath28 star , well above the brown dwarf limit . with current data and b s physical and chemical characteristics",
    ", we can not determine the eventual outcome but we can conclude that b is an extremely young object between the starless core and class 0 stages .",
    "comparison of both @xmath1co maps and the presence of three sources suggest that vla1623 s outflow is not product of a single source .",
    "we propose that the nw lobe is not a cavity but instead two outflows . a drives the northernmost branch while w drives the southermost branch based on its position and the @xmath1co ( 2 - 1 ) blueshifted feature .",
    "the se lobe is difficult to disentangle from the observations presented here , requiring comparison of @xmath1co and jet observations .    for b , the observed spatially overlapped @xmath1co ( 2 - 1 ) emission suggests a compact pole - on outflow .",
    "the red- and blueshifted spatially overlapped so emission and absence of a redshifted lobe in @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) further support this morphology , since the redshifted lobe of b would be located directly behind the blueshifted lobe which is stronger and more easily detected by the compact configuration observations .",
    "additionally , the @xmath1co ( 3 - 2 ) redshifted lobe of b is easily lost among the much stronger redshifted emission of the outflows from a & w.    further analysis on vla1623 s kinematics , outflows and whether it is gravitationally bound , as well as determining b s nature , are required to fully disentangle vla1623 .",
    "however , from its alignment , physical characteristics , environment and differing evolutionary stages we can conclude that vla1623 is a triple non - coeval system probably formed through the delayed fragmentation of a filament .",
    "these characteristics make vla1623 a good target for constraining and studying fragmentation in low - mass protostars .",
