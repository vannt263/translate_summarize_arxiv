    "a hybrid quantum system combines two or more distinct quantum components , exhibiting features not seen in these individual systems .",
    "this provides a promising platform to study novel quantum phenomena .",
    "the jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model is an archetype of such hybridization , which consists of the jch and the coupled cavities .",
    "this model was proposed for the use of the atom - light interaction in coupled microcavity arrays to create strongly correlated many - body models @xcite .",
    "it has received intensive study in a variety of directions ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .    the researches",
    "mainly focus on the ground state phase of many - particle system and the dynamics in single - particle system .",
    "mott insulator phase and superfluid phase are identified  by the traditional order parameter , the average of the annihilation operator @xcite and the observable quantities , atomic concurrence and photon visibility @xcite .",
    "the single - particle dynamics suggests that this hybrid architecture can be the quantum coherent device to transfer and store quantum information as well as to create the laser - like output @xcite .",
    "recently , few - body problem for the jch hamiltonian is also investigated @xcite , claiming the existence of two - polariton bound states when the photon - atom interaction is sufficiently strong .    in this work ,",
    "we study the one - dimensional jch model in the two - excitation subspace . in each invariant subspace ,",
    "the sub - hamiltonian is equivalent to a @xmath0-leg ladder with an effective flux , which is proportional to the center momentum of two excitations .",
    "it is shown that in @xmath1-center - momentum subspace , the ladder system can be reduced to a chain system of spin-@xmath2particle with spin - orbit coupling . as a simple application , based on this concise description ,",
    "a series of bound - pair eigenstates is presented , which display long - range polaritonic entanglement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ jc - hubbard model ] , we present the jch  model and the basis set . in section [ 4-leg ladder with flux ] , the equivalent hamiltonian is given .",
    "in section [ equivalent hamiltonian ] , in @xmath1-center - momentum subspace , the equivalent hamiltonian is reduced to a chain system of spin-@xmath2  particle with spin - orbit coupling . in section [ exact bound - pair states ] , a series of bound - pair eigenstates is constructed . in section [ long - range entanglement ] , we investigate the quantum correlation for the bound - pair states .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussion in section [ summary ] .",
    "the jaynes  cummings model describes a cavity array doped with a single two - level atoms embedded in each cavity and the dipole interaction leads to dynamics involving photonic and atomic degrees of freedom , which is in contrast to the widely studied bose - hubbard model .",
    "such hybrid system can be implemented with the defect array in photonic crystal @xcite or josephson junction array in cavity @xcite .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath19 is just the single excitation number of the polaritons . for each cavity",

    "( [ basis_k1 ] ) and ( [ basis_k2 ] ) , @xmath46 breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , we still have @xmath47 due to the fact that @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "in essence , the nonzero plaquette flux arises from the relation between the complex coupling constants @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast , one can see from @xmath42  that the complex @xmath7  can not induce a nonzero plaquette flux .",
    "we would like to point that the effective magnetic field in the present model is intrinsic , different from that discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .    in order to understand the mechanism of the effective flux , we investigate the exchange process between photon and atomic excitations from the state @xmath52 to state @xmath53 , where @xmath54the action of @xmath15 provides at least two paths for this task : the first one is described as@xmath55and another one is@xmath56it shows that the exchange process acquires a phase @xmath1  along the path ii , which is equivalent to the effect of a flux piercing the loop of two paths .",
    "this investigation implies that the origin of the effective magnetic field may be the special statistics property of the atomic excitations : acts as a fermion at the same site but boson for different locations .",
    "based on the above analysis , the two - polariton scattering problem can be reduced to the study of the single - particle time evolution in the four - leg ladder system . in this paper , we only consider the eigen problem of the two - polariton jc - hubbard model .",
    "we focus on the case of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which leads to @xmath60 .",
