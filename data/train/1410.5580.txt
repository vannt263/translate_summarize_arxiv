    "electrophysiological recordings exhibit a sequence of quasistationary signal states reflecting the underlying neural processing steps  @xcite . here",
    "quasistationary states evolve on a large time scale while transitions between them are much faster .",
    "sequential patterns of quasistationary states have been observed in various quite different natural systems .",
    "for instance , the chaotic lorenz attractor exhibits two quasistationary states ( the so - called _ lorenz wings _ ) which are visited recurrently over time .",
    "the lorenz model is one of the first nonlinear atmospheric models applied in weather forecast  @xcite while it also describes the dynamics in solid - state laser systems  @xcite . in neural systems ,",
    "recurrent temporal activity patterns are known from the replay of memory in hippocampus  @xcite , in bird songs  @xcite and in electroencephalographic data ( eeg ) obtained during epileptic seizures  @xcite .",
    "some more detailed analysis of the dynamics of quasistationary neural states reveal properties of metastable attractors , which attract and repel in different directions in phase space .",
    "good examples for such metastable attractors are saddle nodes with an attracting and a repelling manifold .",
    "hence a sequence of underlying metastable attractors in neural activity generates measurement signals which exhibit a sequence of quasistationary states .",
    "mazor and laurent  @xcite found such a sequence of metastable attractors in the activity of projection neurons in the insect olfactory bulb  @xcite , while freeman and rogers  @xcite revealed sequential rapid phase transitions between spatially synchronised states in eeg signals .",
    "most recently , hudson et al .",
    "@xcite discovered metastable transition networks in the recovery from anesthesia .    during cognitive tasks , lehmann and colleagues",
    "@xcite observed segments of quasistationary eeg topographies , which they called _",
    "brain microstates_. the eeg related to cognitive tasks exhibits a sequence of signal components and is termed _ event - related potential _ ( erp ) .",
    "lehmann et al .",
    "were able to identify the extracted microstates with erp - components which in turn are signal components well - established in neuropsychology as markers of certain neural cognitive processes .",
    "this link between quasistationary signal states and erp - components corroborates the working hypotheses of the present study : erp components reflect quasistable attractor states in brain dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis indicates that the brain performs information processing in a sequence of steps @xcite that is reflected in quasistationary signal states .",
    "therefore , improving the detection of such states in neurophysiological data promises to improve the study of the corresponding states , their neural origin and essentially their meaning in neural information processing .    for the detection of quasistationary states from real - world data",
    "several methods have been proposed .",
    "obviously , one may first plot the signal trajectory in signal space and extract the time windows of apparent quasistationary by visual inspection .",
    "to this end , the dimensionality of multivariate signals may be reduced by principle component analysis ( pca ) or related techniques , cf .",
    "these methods give first insights into the dynamics , but do allow neither classification of the quasistationary states nor extraction of their durations and their transition phases .",
    "more advanced methods for segmenting quasistationary states have to consider ( _ i _ ) nonstationary signal features , i.e. , applying temporally instantaneous methods , ( _ ii _ ) multivariate time series , i.e. , multidimensional signals exhibiting heterogeneous signal characteristics in different dimensions , and ( _ iii _ ) low signal - to - noise ratio where the noise level is not known _",
    "a priori_.    techniques applied in the context of brain computer interfaces aim to extract signal features from multivariate signals  @xcite .",
    "most of them perform a first supervised learning task in order to determine the specific features to be extracted from the eeg .",
    "however this learning phase is not applicable in the detection of quasistationary states .",
    "the present work aims to extract signal features that are unknown _ a priori _ and which may differ slightly between experimental runs .",
    "one of the first successful methods dealing with these signal characteristics is the microstate segmentation technique of lehmann et al .",
    "@xcite , which extracts transient quasistationary states in multivariate eeg signals based on the similarity of their spatial scalp distributions .",
    "it considers the multivariate eeg as a temporal sequence of spatial activity maps and extracts the time windows of the microstates by computing the temporal difference between successive maps .",
    "this procedure allows to compute the time windows of microstates from the signal and classifies them by the spatial averages over eeg electrodes in the extracted state time window .",
    "this method works well for high - dimensional eeg signals with good spatial resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "other similar methods extract signal features by clustering techniques  @xcite taking into account the similarity of the time series in different electrodes .",
    "such methods are less sensitive to noise compared to the microstates method since they avoid the computation of temporal differences .",
    "although methods for single experimental eeg data sets exist , they imply a missing statistical evaluation of the detected time windows , i.e. , one can not ensure that the states found reflect an underlying neural metastable attractor and not just noise .",
    "hence , to evaluate statistically the gained results , it is necessary to perform a statistical evaluation study over several trials .",
    "however , in turn , this implies to map detected temporal segments of different trials to each other and , in the best case , align them to each other .",
    "this task is difficult to perform since single trials are known to exhibit temporal jitter to each other  @xcite , i.e. , they are delayed and shortened to each other .",
    "previous studies have attempted successfully to deal with this problem by applying dynamic time warping on eeg  @xcite .",
    "this technique considers a certain signal template and detects it in the data set under study with respect to dilation and shrinking operations .",
    "the method is not well adjusted to our problem since it is based on a pre - defined signal template which is not known in practice .",
    "the present work elaborates our recently developed recurrence domain analysis method for further improving the temporal segmentation of multivariate signals into quasistationary states by means of symbolic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this method further relaxes the similarity assumption in single time series in the data set under study and is less sensitive to noise .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate how to compute an optimal symbolic sequence in each trial by aligning sequences of quasistationary states that are extracted in each trial by recurrence domain analysis .",
    "we introduce a hausdorff partition clustering method that performs this alignment .",
    "the subsequent section introduces to the technique of recurrence domain analysis and applies a new method on single realisations , i.e. single data sets .",
    "then , several extensions of this method are presented followed by a novel method based on the hausdorff distance to align multiple symbolic sequences gained from multiple data sets .",

    "@xcite which states that almost all trajectories starting in a `` ball '' @xmath0 of radius @xmath1 centered at an initial condition @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 denotes the system s phase space of dimension @xmath4 ) return infinitely often to @xmath0 as time elapses . for time - discrete ( or discretely sampled ) dynamical systems",

    "paradigmatic examples for recurrence domains are , e.g. , the wings of the lorenz attractor centered around its unstable foci @xcite , or saddle sets ( such as saddle nodes or saddle tori ) that are connected by _ stable heteroclinic sequences ( shs ) _ @xcite .    in a recent study @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed a method for the detection of recurrence domains by means of symbolic dynamics @xcite .",
    "our approach is motivated by the fact that a recurrence @xmath13 leads to overlapping @xmath9-balls @xmath14 that can be merged together into equivalence classes which eventually partition , together with their complements and the still isolated balls , the phase space into its respective recurrence domains .",
    "let @xmath15 be a finite partition of the phase space @xmath16 into @xmath17 disjoint sets @xmath18 .",
    "then , the discrete trajectory @xmath19 is mapped onto a symbolic sequence @xmath20 according to the cells of @xmath21 being visited by the states @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath22 when @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "we suggested to create the symbolic sequence @xmath20 from an initial sequence of time indices @xmath24 subjected to a rewriting grammar @xcite to which we refer henceforth as to the _ recurrence grammar _ since this grammar is simply another interpretation of the recurrence matrix @xmath25 obtained in eq .",

    "let us assume that a trajectory consists of only five data points @xmath34 giving rise to the recurrence matrix @xmath35 the algorithm commences with the 5th row , detecting a recurrence @xmath36 . since @xmath37 , a rewriting rule @xmath38 is generated .",
    "because the next recurrence in row 5 is trivial , the algorithm continues with row 4 , where @xmath39 .",
    "now , two rules @xmath40 and @xmath41 are created . the remaining rows 3 , 2 and 1 can be neglected due to the symmetry .",
    "thus , we obtain the following recurrence grammar @xmath42 recursively applying this grammar to the series of time indices @xmath43 yields @xmath44 , i.e. a system with two recurrence domains 1 and 2 . note , that recurrence grammars could be ambiguous , i.e. one left - hand symbol could be expanded into different right - hand symbols by several rules . yet , this is not a problem for the segmentation of the trajectory into recurrence domains when the grammar is recursively applied .",
    "after at most two iterations all ambiguities become resolved through the smallest time index symbolising the earliest recurrence domain .",
    "furthermore , the symbolic alphabet of the rewritten sequence may contain several gaps .",
    "we therefore augmented our algorithm by a search and replace mechanism recoding unused smaller indices by larger ones , thereby squeezing the symbolic repertoire together .      for further illustration and validation of our algorithm",
    ", we carry out a numerical simulation study of a stable heteroclinic contour , i.e. a closed stable heteroclinic sequence between three saddle nodes @xcite that may be regarded as a model for event - related brain potentials , according to our working hypothesis @xcite .",

    "the corresponding phase space partition is depicted by the coloured balls in fig .",

    "one of the pertinent problems in recurrence analysis is optimising the ball size @xmath9 @xcite . in our previous study @xcite , we suggested to maximise the ratio of symbol entropy @xmath69 over the cardinality of the symbolic repertoire @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the relative frequency of symbol @xmath32 in the symbolic sequence @xmath72 .",
    "however , this utility function strongly penalises large alphabets through the denominator @xmath70 such that the proposed procedure is biased towards binary partitions which is not appropriate in most applications , such as our shs example as well .",
    "therefore , we here remedy this bias by an additional recoding of @xmath72 .",
    "the symbolic dynamics obtained from recurrence grammar encoding still contains subsequences ( or `` words '' ) of monotonically increasing time indices , resulting from isolated @xmath9-balls .",
    "these isolated balls , reflecting the transients of the dynamics , entail large symbol alphabets that are punished by the utility function above .",
    "for a new optimisation method , we scan the sequence @xmath72 for monotonically increasing time indices , such as 4567 that are replaced by a new symbol 0 resulting in a subsequence 0000 .",
    "thereby , all isolated balls receive the same label 0 , now indicating `` transient '' in the symbolic dynamics .",
    "this new symbol is plotted red in fig .",
    "[ fig : shs ] ; red segments and partition cells therefore denote transients in our encoding .",
    "hence , the optimisation algorithm performs a sequence of three encoding steps : ( _ i _ ) rewriting by the recurrence grammar , ( _ ii _ ) shifting the alphabet for closing gaps , ( _ iii _ ) mapping transients onto 0 .",
    "figure [ fig : epsopt ] shows the intermediate results of this optimisation procedure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsopt](a ) we plot the final symbolic sequences ( called @xmath72 , again ) in dependence of the ball - size @xmath9 .    the symbolic dynamics plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsopt](a ) starts with @xmath73 in the first row . here",
    ", almost all balls remain isolated which is shown by the symbol 0 printed in olive here . for increasing @xmath9 , the number of recurrences increases due to the trajectory s slowing down in the vicinity of the saddle nodes .",
    "these saddles correspond to the `` tongues '' widening up to the recurrence domains .",
    "for some range of @xmath9 the results are quite robust , indicating the stability of our algorithm . at the bottom row of fig .",

    "[ fig : epsopt](b ) which is relatively broad and exhibits several local maxima .",
    "therefore , we suggest not to look for one of these ( probably ) spurious maxima for optimizing @xmath9 , but rather for the median of a symmetric distribution , or likewise for another quantile in case of an asymmetric entropy distribution . in this way we obtained the optimal ball size @xmath75 for fig .

    "these trajectories are additionally captured by stable heteroclinic channels ( shc ) @xcite that illustrate another important property of event - related brain potentials . adopting our working hypothesis again , that erp components correspond to saddle sets , or more generally ,",
    "to recurrence domains in the brain s phase space @xcite , we need to understand the emergence of erp waveforms from ensemble averages over realisations of the system s dynamics starting from randomly distributed initial conditions @xcite .    to this end ,",
    "we simulated an ensemble of 20 trajectories starting from randomly distributed initial conditions in the vicinity of the first saddle node ( the blue recurrence domain in fig .",
    "[ fig : shs ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : shc ] shows the phase portrait of this ensemble ( each realisation plotted in a different colour ) in fig .  [ fig : shc](a ) and the @xmath67-components in fig .",
    "[ fig : shc](b ) .",
    "in addition we present the ensemble averages as the fat black curves in both pictures .",
    "figure [ fig : shc ] nicely demonstrates that all simulated trajectories are confined to a `` tube '' , namely the shc , stretched across the saddle nodes .",
    "this channel is stable against small perturbations in the initial conditions and also against additive noise @xcite .",
    "however , the figure also shows the dispersion of the ensemble average which is inevitable in standard erp analyses ( yet see @xcite for alternative approaches ) .",
    "this dispersion is due to the velocity differences dependent on the distance of the actual state from the saddles .",
    "the closer a state comes to the saddle the larger is its acceleration along the stable and its deceleration along the unstable manifold .",
    "hence , the velocities with which states explore their available phase space crucially depend on the initial conditions .",
    "as the system evolves , the dynamics accumulates phase differences , deteriorating the averaged ensemble trajectory .",
    "this finding is consistent with the phase - resetting hypothesis of erps @xcite because phase - resetting takes place in the preparation of initial conditions .    yet , our example is also relevant for the larger scope of nonlinear data analysis problems .",
    "computing recurrence plots and subsequent recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) @xcite is numerically rather expensive and therefore restricted to relatively short time series . in practice ,",
    "a long - lasting time series is therefore cut into many segments for which recurrence analyses is carried out individually .",
    "the pertinent problem is then comparison and alignment of the individual results .    in the framework of our symbolic recurrence domain analysis",
    ", we suggest here a solution based on a clustering algorithm whose results are presented in fig .",

    "[ fig : shc ] , now encoded with the @xmath77 quantile .",
    "figure [ fig : hdcluster](a ) shows different realisations using essentially the same colour palette which is due to the recurrence grammar and recoding algorithm .",
    "however , the same symbol ( i.e. colour ) does not necessarily refer to the same recurrence domain in the system s phase space ( with one exception : transients are always encoded as 0 , here plotted in dark blue ) .",
    "therefore , we have to render the sequences in [ fig : hdcluster](a ) comparable with respect to corresponding regions in phase space .    for that aim ,",
    "we first gather all discrete sampling points belonging to the same phase space cell @xmath18 that is labeled by the symbol @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath78 . since high - dimensional phase spaces are usually very sparsely populated with sampling points from experimental or simulated data , we then project the cells onto the @xmath4-dimensional hypersphere through @xmath79 .",
    "this is also justified by the goal to clustering recurrent topographies of erp data @xcite .    in the next step ,",
    "the recurrence domain partitions @xmath80 of two subsequent realisations are merged together into a set system @xmath81 by regarding all symbols ( apart from 0 ) as being different .",
    "this system is in general not a partition any more . from the members of @xmath82",
    "we then calculate the pairwise hausdorff distances @xmath83 where @xmath84 measures the `` distance '' of the point @xmath85 from the compact set @xmath86 .",
    "the hausdorff distance between two compact sets vanishes , when they are intersecting .",
    "the recurrence domains taken into account here are clearly compact sets as they are finite unions of intersecting @xmath9-balls .    from the pairwise hausdorff distances ( [ eq : hddist ] ) we compute the @xmath87-similarity matrix @xmath88 with elements @xmath89 which has essentially the same properties as the recurrence matrix @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rp ] ) .",
    "therefore , we merge the members of @xmath82 into new partition cells by interpreting @xmath88 as another recurrence grammar for rewriting large indices of @xmath90 by smaller ones from @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) when they are @xmath87-similar ( @xmath93 ) .    for numerical implementation",

    "starting from the working hypothesis that event - related brain potentials ( erp ) reflect quasistationary states in brain dynamics , we have elaborated an earlier proposal for the detection of quasistationary states and for the segmentation of electroencephalographic time series into recurrence domains .",
    "this segmentation technique interprets the recurrence matrix as a rewriting grammar that applies to the time indices of an erp data set . after further recoding steps ,",
    "the quasistationary states are detected as recurrence domains in phase space as indicated by a symbolic dynamics .",
    "moreover , we have suggested a method for the alignment and unification of multiple eeg trials ( i.e. single subject erps ) by means of hausdorff partition clustering .",
    "we think that the presented methods could be of significance for the greater community of nonlinear time series analysis , as we have addressed some pertinent problems in recurrence analysis and symbolic dynamics .",
    "we have suggested an optimisation procedure for choosing the ball size of recurrence plots by maximising the entropy of the symbol distribution that is obtained by applying recurrence grammars and subsequent recoding of transients . also the alignment and comparison of recurrence plots of different time windows or different realisations was an unsolved problem so far .",
    "we solved this problem by merging together recurrence domains from different time series upon their similarity with respect to the hausdorff distance either in phase space , or , in projection onto the unit sphere .",
