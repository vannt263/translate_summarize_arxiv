    "it is well established that electron / hole diffraction from a static magnetic order in a conductor can influence the fs topology ; this is fs reconstruction .",
    "in addition it is also well established that spin and charge are separate in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this results in two interesting but important generic questions ; ( i ) can _ dynamic _ magnetic fluctuations also drive a change in the fs topology ?",
    "( ii ) is spin - charge separation possible in two - dimensions , and if so what is the meaning of the separation . in the present work we address these two generic problems and",
    "demonstrate that these two problems are remarkably related .",
    "these two important issues have recently attracted alot of attention due to their close tie to the high @xmath3 superconductivity in the cuprates .    to address the two generic problems of interest we consider a small number of holes injected into the bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet where the interlayer coupling drives the strength of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the system has an @xmath0 quantum critical point ( qcp ) separating the magnetically ordered and the magnetically disordered phases .",
    "we show that indeed purely dynamic short range af correlations in the absence of a static af order can cause a lp in which the topology of the fs is changed .",
    "the position of the lp , while being close to the position of the qcp is generally different .",
    "dependent on the additional hole hopping integrals @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the lp can be located either in the magnetically ordered and/or in the magnetically disordered phase .",
    "vojta and becker @xcite also observed a lp in a similar model .",
    "however , in their study the lp was always in the af ordered phase and therefore the central issue of the dynamic magnetic fluctuation driven lp has not yet been addressed .",
    "we also demonstrate that the hole spin and charge necessarily separate when approaching the magnetic @xmath0 qcp when the lp is in the magnetically disordered phase .",
    "the possibility of spin - charge separation ( scs ) in 2d has been previously studied using the slave - boson method @xcite .",
    "however , the slave - boson method as applied to the @xmath6 model implies the scs ad hoc @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in the present work , therefore , the precise meaning of scs in the present work is different from that of the slave - boson method",
    ".    our interest in the two generic problems is motivated by the cuprates , which , in our opinion , manifest both the lp as well as scs .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to explain the connection with the cuprates which we do below .",
    "a reader who is interested in these generic problems but not necessarily their application to the cuprates can go directly to eq .",
    "( 1 ) where we start the analysis",
    ".    one of the central issues in understanding high-@xmath3 superconductivity is whether it originates from a fermi liquid or from a mott insulator . while there is no consensus on the problem ,",
    "there are experimental indications including angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) that the transition from small to large fermi surface occurs in the hole doping range @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "fermi arcs @xcite observed below this doping level have triggered various theoretical studies and models .",
    "however , recent arpes data supports the existence of a shadow band that completes the arc into a pocket @xcite .",
    "the existence of hole pockets is in agreement with several calculations which considered dilute holes dressed by spin fluctuations , based on doping a mott insulator @xcite . on the other hand , a large fermi surface as expected from a fermi liquid approach is observed in arpes studies in the optimally to overdoped cuprates .",
    "naturally , this implies that there is at least one topological lifshitz point @xcite ( lp ) in the doping range @xmath7 , where the fermi surface changes from small to large in contradiction to the luttinger theorem .",
    "a phenomenological description based on fermi liquid picture@xcite , as well as dynamical mean - field theory calculations within hubbard model@xcite have been proposed to describe this lp .",
    "magnetic quantum oscillation ( mqo ) in underdoped yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 @xcite supports the small pocket scenario , in contrast to the large fs observed on the overdoped side @xcite .",
    "the above observations also suggests the existence of a lp at which the topology of the fs changes .",
    "the mqo measurements were performed in very strong magnetic fields , up to 80 t .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the field induces a static magnetic structure and the structure causes the small fermi surface reconstruction . on the one hand ,",
    "the mqo experiments suggest the small fs was observed up to 12% doping @xcite , and it is unlikely that even an 80 t field can generate a static af order at such high doping . on the other hand the short range",
    "dynamic af correlations always exist in the cuprates ; this has been supported by recent rixs measurements @xcite which have remarkably demonstrated that such correlations are practically doping independent , from mott insulator to optimal doping .",
    "based on this data one can conjecture that the cuprates are always close to magnetic criticality .",
    "this motivates us to study if the lp can be driven by short range , purely dynamic af correlations .",
    "we consider a bilayer model for the sake of performing a controlled calculation .",
    "however , we believe that conceptually our conclusions are equally applicable to both single and multi - layer cuprates .    besides the possible topological transition , this particular doping range @xmath11 has also been associated with a quantum critical point ( qcp ) where the static magnetic ordering becomes fully dynamic . below this doping range",
    ", neutron scattering indicates a commensurate or incommensurate magnetic ordering depending on the doping level as well as the coupling between the cuo@xmath12 planes @xcite .",
    "the static magnetic order vanishes within this doping range , as also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) wipeout,@xcite and recently confirmed by muon spin rotation ( @xmath13sr ) data @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the static magnetic moment has been calculated within a low energy effective theory @xcite , and a qcp around @xmath14 is predicted , close to the experimental value @xmath15 observed in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10.@xcite .",
    "it is then intriguing to ask whether the topological lp is related to this magnetic qcp , especially how the change of magnetic excitations can influence the electronic properties .",
    "however , currently there is no precise measure to discern whether the topological transition takes place in the magnetically ordered or the fully dynamic phase .",
    "now we turn to the discussion of scs and its relation to magnetic quantum criticality . in la@xmath16sr@xmath17cuo@xmath18",
    "the qcp is smeared out because of disorder . however , in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 the qcp is located experimentally at doping @xmath15 ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "scs manifests itself in the cuprates as a phenomenon related to the magnetic qcp mentioned above . in the magnetically ordered phase , the pseudospin that marks",
    "the sublattice is a good quantum number for holes .",
    "the meaning of partial scs is then the unusual way the pseudospin interacts with an external magnetic field @xcite and this is the meaning of the partial scs in the magnetically ordered phase @xcite . on the other side of the qcp",
    ", the lack of long range order indicates that spin and charge are recombined , as expected from the fermi liquid approach .",
    "however , it is unclear how scs develops as one approaches the qcp from the magnetically disordered phase , or stating from another aspect , if there is a certain residual effect from scs that affects the hole motion in the magnetically disordered phase .",
    "in addition , since the qcp and lp are located in close vincinity , is scs related to or participate in the mechanism that causes fs reconstruction . in the present work we analyse the process of scs at the qcp .",
    "the model considered here has only commensurate magnetic ordering , so we put aside incommensurability in the cuprates .",
    "our recent work @xcite suggests that the two seemingly unrelated issues of fs reconstruction and scs may originate from the same mechanism , namely nearly critical quantum fluctuations . by studying the bilayer afm in the magnetically disordered phase ,",
    "we show that dynamic magnetic fluctuations , driven by the ratio of the interlayer to the intralayer coupling @xmath20 , has a dramatic effect on both the dispersion and spectral function of a single hole .",
    "the system under consideration has a @xmath0 qcp at @xmath21 , close to which the dispersion has minima at @xmath22 .",
    "this results in small hole pockets similar to that in the cuprates at small doping .",
    "the pockets are formed due to strong in - plane af correlations which diminish the nearest site hopping @xmath23 . upon increasing @xmath24",
    "the in - plane af correlations are reduced and the dispersion minima gradually shift toward @xmath25 reaching this position at some value @xmath26 .",
    "this is the position of the lp where the shape of the single hole dispersion changes . in - plane",
    "af fluctuations are negligible at very large @xmath24 , so the hole dispersion recovers the shape expected from a fermi liquid approach , but the bandwidth is a factor of two reduced due to @xmath24 .",
    "note that we examine only the single hole case to demonstrate the mechanism , so the notion of a fs is ambiguious .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that the scba typically converges at small doping up to @xmath27 or so , and the rigid band approximation in most models is valid .",
    "therefore we expect our results to be valid at small doping , where the fs changes from four small pockets centered around @xmath28 at @xmath29 to one small pocket centered at @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "although it is unclear at present if this model can be realized in certain materials and if the driving parameter @xmath20 can be controlled externally , one clear prediction is that if an mqo experiment is available for such a compound , then one would observe the mqo frequency changes by a factor of four across the lp .",
    "taking these issues back to the cuprates , an intriguing argument for the relevance of our calculations comes from recent resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) experiments @xcite .",
    "rixs indicates that magnetic fluctuations exist even in the overdoped regime , and is practically unrenormalized as in the undoped parent compound .",
    "therefore purely dynamic magnetic fluctuations are very likely to be the driving force behind fs reconstruction , even though the lp in the cuprates takes place in a doping region that has no static magnetic order .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the magnetic fluctuations in the cuprates , regardless of the possible multilayer structure in a unit cell , are likely to be purely 2d , and the interlayer coupling is unlikely to be a crucial driving force for the magnetic fluctuations . therefore , despite the appealing conclusions from the bilayer afm , a theory that can address the 2d magnetic fluctuations in the cuprates will be much more challenging , and is yet to be formulated .",
    "the purpose of this extended version is to provide a detailed formalism for the results presented in ref . , and to clarify several points that we omitted to address .",
    "we provide details for the bond operator formalism that describes the magnetic fluctuations in terms of triplon excitations .",
    "this mean field formalism yields a good agreement with quantum monte carlo and series expansion results @xcite , and has the advantage that hole dynamics can be treated within a simple self - consistent born approximation(scba ) . as mentioned in ref .",
    ", the hole - triplon vertex has a discrepency with a previous study @xcite , so we provide detailed calculations to justify our vertex . to support the argument of magnetic fluctuation induced fs reconstruction , we have drawn evidence from series expansion calculations to justify our scba approach . in this long version we provide numerical results of the series expansion calculations and make a direct comparison with the scba calculations .",

    "the @xmath41 term describes the antiferromagnetic coupling in each layer as well as between the two layers .",
    "it is well known that without holes ( half - filling ) the model has an o(3 ) magnetic qcp at @xmath42 @xcite separating the magnetically disordered and the af ordered phases .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath43 result in charge dynamics if a hole is injected into the system .",

    "looking at fig.[fig : spectralfermit310tp080tpp070](a ) , which is at the qcp , we observe that the lowest energy spectral function corresponding to @xmath204 , does not have a pole , but only a cut .",
    "according to previous studies for the case of an immobile impurity , the presence of a cut indicates that the spin density is distributed in a power cloud around the hole @xcite . because the green s function in the present case is similar to that of the immobile impurity we directly project the results of refs .",
    "@xcite to understand scs at the qcp in the present case . when approaching the qcp from the magnetically disordered phase the quasiparticle residue approaches zero , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , as the triplon gap @xmath171 approaches zero .",

    "as one moves away from the qcp into the magnetically disordered phase , the quasiparticle peak appears , but the triplon gap is still significant as long as the system is close to the qcp ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralfermit310tp080tpp070](b ) ) .",
    "this indicates a significant amount of spin is still relatively delocalized from the hole , and a rather smooth crossover to the spin charge recombined region . on the other side of the qcp , deep inside the af phase , the hole interaction with a magnetic field",
    "is described by pseudospin @xcite and this interaction implies a partial scs @xcite .",
    "evolution of the spin cloud when approaching the qcp _ from the af phase _ is not clear at present .    because of the diverging size of the magnon cloud the hole effective mass also diverges at the qcp .",
    "drawing analogy with the cuprates we note that the effective mass measured in mqo @xcite diverges on approaching the qcp as identified by neutron scattering studies @xcite .",
    "we provide a detailed theory for the results presented in ref . where we considered the bilayer @xmath45 model with strong interlayer coupling @xmath24 . in our analysis",
    "we assumed that the hole doping is low and does not influence the magnetic dynamics and hence fill rigid bands formed by quantum magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we have argued that our results should be valid for doping @xmath213 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic dynamics are driven only by the interlayer coupling @xmath24 with a magnetic qcp at @xmath214 separating the magnetically ordered and magnetically disordered phases .",
    "comparison between the hole dynamics described by the scba and series expansion methods are made explicitly , which shows excellent agreement .    at @xmath215",
    "the hole fermi surface is connected and centered at @xmath30 .",
    "we found that at a certain @xmath216 the af correlations reconstruct the connected fermi surface into four seperate pockets centered close to @xmath217 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the lp where the topology of the fermi surface is changed can be located within the magnetically disordered phase .",
    "the lp is driven by purely dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations in absence of any static magnetic order .",
    "the precise position of the lp at which this topological transition occurs depends on hole hopping integrals @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "this is because the reason behind the shifting of the hole pockets is due to magnetic fluctuations that diminish the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath218 and @xmath219 then have the tendency to create hole pockets near @xmath220 .",
    "the precise position of lp depends on the balance of these two mechanisms .",
    "in fact , for certain values of @xmath218 and @xmath219 one may not see such transition if they are too weak to overcome the residual @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , for the parameters that are closest to the real cuprates , one sees such a transition at @xmath221 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spingapvelocity ] .    we have also demonstrated that if the lp is located in the magnetically disordered phase then , on approaching the magnetic qcp , the hole spin and charge separate .",
    "the separation scale is equal to the magnetic correlation length which diverges at the qcp .",
    "we are not aware of any 2d materials which have a low concentration of charge carriers and a magnetic qcp driven by a separation parameter .",
    "perhaps such materials will be synthesised in the future and/or the model can be realised in cold atoms . however , the most important outcome of the analysis is the demonstration of the principal possibility of the dynamic magnetic fluctuation driven topological transition and spin - charge separation .",
