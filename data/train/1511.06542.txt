    "the fermi gamma - ray telescope ( hereafter , fermi ) launched in 2008 has facilitated the study of gamma - ray emission process in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the large area telescope on - board the fermi ( hereafter fermi - lat ) has measured the gamma - ray emissions from more than 150 pulsars ( fermi collaboration 2015 ) , and has measured the spectra and the pulse profiles above 1gev with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "for example , fermi - lat found that the gamma - ray flux above the cut - off energy at around @xmath1gev decays slower than pure exponential function ( abdo et al . 2010a , 2013 ) .",
    "this cut - off behaviour favours the emissions from the outer magnetosphere ( e.g. slot gap , outer gap and annular gap ) and rules out the classical polar cap scenario , which predicted a super exponential cutoff feature in the gev spectrum because of the magnetic pair - creation process . among fermi - lat pulsars ,",
    "20 pulsars are found to show pulsed emissions in the energy range @xmath0 gev , including 12 up to @xmath2 gev ( ackermann et al . 2013 ) and their spectra clearly indicate sub - exponential cut - off features above the cut - off energy ( ackermann et al .",
    "the pulsed gamma - ray emissions from the crab pulsar show single power law spectrum above cut - off energy ( @xmath3gev ) and extends to tev energy bands ( aleksi@xmath4 et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 , 2014 ; aliu et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 , abdo et al .",
    "the gev / tev emissions from the crab pulsar disagree with the spectra of the standard curvature radiation scenario ( e.g. cheng et al .",
    "2000 ; takata & chang 2007 ; harding et al . 2008 ) , and will originate from the inverse - compton scattering process in the outer magnetosphere ( lyutikov et al . 2012 ; harding and kalapotharakos 2015 ) or pulsar wind region ( aharonian et al . 2012 ) .",
    "we ( leung et al . 2014 ) reported the detection of the pulsed emissions above 50gev from the vela pulsar , and showed that the previous models ( e.g. hirotani 2007 ; takata et al .",
    "2008 ) predicted a smaller flux level at 50 - 100gev energy bands than the observed flux .",
    "a study of sub - exponential spectrum above cut - off energy will discriminate among emission models .",
    "in addition to sub - exponential cut - off behaviour , the fermi - lat observations have revealed several interesting relations between the gamma - ray emission properties and the spin down characteristics ; ( 1 ) the gamma - ray emission efficiency , which is the luminosity divided by the spin down power , decreases with the spin down power , and ( 2 ) the spectrum between 100mev and the cut - off energy at around @xmath5gev tends to be softer for a larger spin down pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , ( 3 ) the second peak in the light curve is in general more prominent in higher energy bands ( e.g. crab , vela and geminga pulsars , abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , and ( 4 ) fermi - lat millisecond pulsar with a higher spin down power and a larger magnetic field strength at the light cylinder tends to have crab - like pulse profiles , in which radio / x - ray / gamma - ray pulses are in phase ( ng et al .",
    "explanations for these observed properties with a model will advance in understanding of the nature of the high - energy emission process in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the cause of the formation of the non - exponential cut - off decay is still in debate .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010b ) and vigan@xmath6 and torres ( 2015 ) argued that a sub - exponential cut - off in the observed spectrum could be understood as the superposition of several power law plus exponential cut - off functions with varying the photon index and the cut - off energy , for which the different components are produced at the different region of the pulsar magnetosphere cutting across our line of sight .",
    "the contribution of the inverse - compton scattering process ( likewise the crab pulsar ) is one of the proposed models to explain the high - energy tail of the vela pulsar ( e.g. lyutikov et al .",
    ". however , the required soft - photon number density in the magnetosphere to explain the observed gev flux level will be much larger than one inferred from the optical / uv / ir observations of the vela pulsar ( takata et al .",
    "2008 ) .    we ( leung et al .",
    "2014 ) discussed the formation of the spectrum of the vela pulsar within framework of the outer gap model , and proposed a non - steady model . in this new outer gap model ,",
    "the electrons and positrons that enter the gap from outer and inner boundaries , respectively , control the gap structure ( size , particle distribution and electric field strength etc . ) and a smaller rate of the particle injection produces thicker outer gap and harder spectrum .",
    "the model suggested that the injection rate much smaller than goldreich - julian value produces the observed gamma - ray emissions above 10gev .",
    "we argued that the rate of the particle injection at the gap boundaries could fluctuate with time and the observed gamma - ray spectrum is superposition of the emissions from different stationary gap structures with different injection rates .    in this paper , we will discuss a detail of the three - dimensional calculation method for this new outer gap model , since we did not provide it in our previous observational paper ( leung et al .",
    "in section  [ vela ] , we present the predicted spectrum and light curve of the vela pulsar .",
    "we will discuss the observed energy dependent light curve . in section  [ disc",
    "] , we will apply our model to other gamma - ray emitting pulsars , and will discuss how our model interprets the observed relation between the spectral softness below cut - off energy and the spin down power .",
    "we will also discuss the crab - like millisecond pulsar and the limit of our model .",
    "the global simulations have been developed to investigate structure of the magnetosphere with the high - energy emission region .",
    "earlier particle simulations showed that the magnetosphere with no - pair - creation process settles down into a quiet state with electron cloud above the polar caps , a positively charged equatorial disc and vacuum gaps in the middle latitudes ( krause - polstorff & michel 1985 ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ; wada & shibata 2007 ) .",
    "recent particle - in - cell simulations have shown the pulsar magnetosphere with the discharged particles created by the pair - creation process .",
    "chen & beloborodov ( 2014 ) discussed that if pair - creation multiplicity is very high at outer magnetosphere around the light cylinder , the outer gap around the light cylinder was quenched and the magnetosphere is similar to the force - free solution with a super goldrecih - julian current sheet and the y - point near the light cylinder , where are main high - energy emission region ( spitkovsky 2006 ) . on the other hand , it is also suggested that if the pair - creation process in the outer magnetosphere is low , the outer gap can survive from the fill of discharge particles and it can be high - energy emission regions ( wada & shibata 2007 ; yuki & shibata 2012 ) .",
    "it is still under debate for the structure of pulsar magnetosphere as well as the high - energy emission region , since the current global simulations are difficult to deal with the realistic pair - creation process by taking into account the position dependent mean free path and soft - photon density .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the pulsar magnetosphere has an outer gap and the high - energy gamma - rays are produced by the curvature radiation process of the discharge pairs inside the outer gap .",
    "our local model precisely calculate the pair - creation rate in the outer magnetosphere . as we will see in section  [ pair ] , the optical depth of the photon - photon pair - creation process around light cylinder is of order of @xmath7 for most of pulsars , and most of the gamma - rays emitted from outer gap can escape from the light cylinder .      to activate the gamma - ray emissions and subsequent pair - creation cascade in the outer gap , the charged particles ( electrons and/or positrons ) should enter the gap along the magnetic field line from outside the gap ; the outer gap will be inactive without the injection of the particles at the gap boundaries . in this paper",
    ", we use terminology `` injected current '' to refer the electric current component carried by the electrons / positrons that enter the outer gap from the gap boundaries . the outer gap thickness in the poloidal plane",
    "affects to the magnitude of the accelerating electric field and therefore hardness / luminosity of the curvature emissions ; a thinner outer gap produces a smaller accelerating electric field and a softer / fainter gamma - ray emissions . from electrodynamical point of view",
    ", we expect that the outer gap has a thickness so that the pair - creation cascade in the gap produces an electric current of order of the goldreich - julian value and hence the gap structure will be affected by amount of the particles ( i.e. injected current ) that enter the gap from the inner and/or outer boundaries .",
    "takata et al . ( 2006 ) calculated two - dimensional outer gap structure and investigated the dependency of gamma - ray spectra on injection rates of the particles at the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "they demonstrated that a larger injection produces in general a thinner outer gap and a softer gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "for the inclination angle less than @xmath8degree , the positrons and electrons can enter the gap from inner and outer boundaries , respectively .    the physical origin of the injected particles at the gap boundaries",
    "are argued as follows . as suggested by shibata ( 1991 , 1995 ) , the polar cap accelerator , outer gap region , and the pulsar wind region , where the electric current crosses the magnetic field lines , should be connected by the current circulating the magnetosphere .",
    "as shown in global simulations ( e.g. yuki & shibata 2012 ) , we expect that the pair - creation process in the polar cap accelerator will make the current that flows higher latitude around the magnetic pole , while the discharged particles in the outer gap accelerator are main current carriers at lower - latitude region around the last - open field lines .",
    "the polar cap accelerator model usually assumes a particle injection from the neutron star surface . for the inclination angle @xmath9 ,",
    "the electrons from the stellar surface are injected into the polar cap accelerator and initiate the pair - creation cascade process through the magnetic pair - creation and/or photon - photon pair - creation processes ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) .",
    "the discharged pairs form the current that flows higher altitude .",
    "most of particles from the polar cap region will flow out from the magnetosphere and will form the pulsar wind .",
    "but it has been suggested that some of negative particles ( for @xmath8degree ) cross the magnetic field lines towards equator due to @xmath10 drift ( wada & shibata 2011l ; yuki & shibata 2012 ) , where @xmath11 is the radiation drag force , and they eventually return to the star along the magnetic field lines at the lower latitude .",
    "it is probable that on the way from the light cylinder to the star , the returning electrons enter to the outer gap along the magnetic field line from the outer boundary .",
    "the high - energy emissions by the returning electrons and subsequent pair - creation cascade processes produce the discharged pairs that also contribute to the current flowing lower latitude around the last - open field lines . in section  [ cont ]",
    "we discuss the current conservation along the magnetic field line .",
    "we can argue several possibilities for the physical origin of the positrons that enter the gap from the inner boundary . in the polar cap accelerator",
    ", the discharged positrons will return to the polar cap region .",
    "if the star continuously absorbs the positrons more than electrons , it would be charged up positively . to keep the charge of the star at constant",
    ", the positrons should be re - emitted from stellar surface along the magnetic field lines outside polar cap accelerator .",
    "such positrons could enter the outer gap from the inner boundary and contribute to the electric current flowing along the magnetic field lines that penetrate the outer gap .",
    "moreover , the gamma - rays produced in the outer gap will create more pairs around the inner boundary ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ map ] ) , and residual electric field could separate the charge particles .",
    "these discharged pairs could effectively become the injection current at the inner boundary , because the main emission region of the outer gap is beyond the null charge surface .",
    "takata et al . (",
    "2010 ) also argued that the gamma - rays emitted towards the stellar surface by the incoming particles may generate new pairs via the magnetic pair - creation process near the stellar surface , and some new pairs could be returned to the outer gap due to complicated surface magnetic field structure .",
    "these returning positrons also could enter the gap from the inner boundary .      although the pulsed radio emissions averaged over longer time - scale is stationary",
    ", there is a wide range of variability in a shorter times scale in the radio emissions from the pulsar ( e.g. kramer et al .",
    "2002 ; lyne et al . 2010 ; keane 2013 ) .",
    "the micro - second variations seen in single pulse could be produced by spatial fluctuation in the emission region .",
    "the pulse - to - pulse variations on the timescale of millisecond to second likely represent timescale of the temporal variation of the structure of the emission region ( e.g. time dependent pair - creation process / particle emissions from the stellar surface ) .",
    "the longer timescale ( second to year ) variations associated with the mode switching and nulling , which sometimes accompany the variations of the spin down rate , could be related with the changes of entire magnetosphere .",
    "these observations suggest that the switching between different states of magnetosphere is probably a general feature of the pulsars    in this paper , we assume that the outer gap structure is temporal variable and that the observed gamma - ray emissions are superposition of the different outer gap structures . we argue that the non - stationary behaviour of the outer gap is caused by the time variation of the rate of particle injections at the gap boundaries .",
    "we expect that the time - scale of variations is of order of or longer than the crossing timescale of the light cylinder , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the light cylinder radius and @xmath14 is the pulsar spin period .",
    "for example , as we discussed above , the discharged pairs produced around the inner boundary could effectively become the origin of injected particles at inner boundary .",
    "in such a case , the temporal variation of the outer gap will be related to the variation of the pair - creation rate around the null charge surface . since the pair - creation rate depends on the gamma - ray intensity and surface x - rays intensity , which is affected by the returning particles ( c.f .",
    "section  [ xray ] ) , around the light cylinder , the expected time - scale of the variation will be of order of the light - cylinder crossing time - scale @xmath15 .",
    "the variation of the electrons returning from the pulsar wind region , which will enter the gap from the outer boundary , will be of order of or longer than the light - cylinder crossing time - scale , since the time - scale shorter than the crossing time - scale may be smoothed out during the travel around global magnetosphere .",
    "we assume that the observed gamma - ray spectrum is a superposition of the emissions from various _ stationary _ gap structures with various particle injection rates at the gap boundaries , and the stationary outer gap structure for an injection rate forms with the crossing time - scale @xmath15 . for a fixed particle injection rate ,",
    "our stationary solution will be stable for a small perturbation .",
    "for example , if the accelerating electric field increase from the stationary solution , the curvature photon energy and hence pair - creation rate increase from the stationary solution .",
    "the increase of the number of pairs try to screen the perturbed electric field .",
    "in this section , we describe our basic equations for solving the gap structure with a fixed injection rate at the boundary . by using vacuum rotating dipole magnetic field",
    ", we solve the poisson equation to obtain the accelerating electric field ( section  [ accele ] ) , for which the charge density in the gap is obtained by solving the continuity equations for the electrons and positrons ( section  [ cont ] ) with the curvature radiation process and pair - creation process ( section  [ casc ] ) . in section  [ cont ] , we will discuss the conservation of the electric current along the magnetic field line .",
    "we investigate the outer gap structure under the steady condition that @xmath16 with @xmath17 being spin angular frequency .",
    "the electric field along the magnetic field line arises in the charge depletion region from so called goldreich - julian charge density , and it accelerates the positrons and electrons to an ultra - relativistic speed . the poisson equation for the accelerating electric field is written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the space charge density and @xmath20 is the laplacian .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 is the goldreich - julian charge density , where @xmath22 is the component of the magnetic field projected to the rotation axis .",
    "the accelerating electric field along the magnetic field line is computed from @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the distance along the magnetic field line .    to solve the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) ,",
    "we adopt coordinate system based on the distance along the field line , @xmath24 , from the star ( @xmath25 ) and the magnetic coordinates , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are angles measured from and around the magnetic axis , respectively ( hirotani 2006 ) .",
    "we define @xmath28 at the north magnetic pole and @xmath29 ( magnetic meridian ) at the plane that includes the rotation axis and north magnetic pole for inclined rotator .",
    "the coordinates @xmath30 relate with the canonical spherical coordinates @xmath31 , for which @xmath32 axis coincides with the rotation axis , as @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the stellar radius , @xmath37 is the local magnetic field strength and @xmath38 are @xmath31 components of the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we define that @xmath39 corresponds to the rotation axis and @xmath40 is the magnetic meridian",
    ". we can relate between ( @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 ) as @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the inclination angle .      for 3-d outer gap , there are six boundaries , that is , inner ( stellar side ) , outer ( light cylinder side ) , lower , upper , leading side and trailing side boundaries . for inclined rotator ,",
    "the charge deficit region at the azimuthal angle @xmath46 is in general less active , because the null charge surface is located close to the light cylinder , and because the electric field is too small to boost the charge particles up to ultra - relativistic speed that can produce the high - energy gamma - rays . in this paper , therefore , we put the numerical boundaries on the magnetic field lines labelled by @xmath47 for the leading side ( positive sign ) and the trailing side ( negative sign ) of the gap , and impose the mathematical boundary conditions that @xmath48 .    for fixed azimuthal angle @xmath27 , the lower and upper gap boundaries lay on the magnetic field lines .",
    "we fix the lower boundary at the last - open field lines and impose @xmath48 on it .",
    "we also impose @xmath48 on the upper boundary and solve it s position , for which the gap can create an assumed electric current density ( c.f . section  [ model ] ) . in the calculation",
    ", we set the outer boundary near the light cylinder and impose @xmath49 on the boundary .",
    "we initially apply the numerical boundary at @xmath50 and solve the gap dynamics .",
    "if the electric field changes its sign around the given outer boundary , then we set new outer boundary at the location where the solved electric field changes its sign , because we anticipate that the outer gap should be unstable if the field - aligned electric field changes its sign inside the gap .",
    "finally , let us consider the inner boundary ( stellar side ) .",
    "because we assume that there is no potential drop between the stellar surface and the inner boundary , we impose the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "since arbitrary given boundary does not satisfy both the dirichlet - type and the neumann - type conditions , we seek for the appropriate boundary by moving the boundary step by step . with two - dimensional analysis , takata et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discussed that the inner boundary of the outer gap starts from the position where the charge density of the current carriers is equal to the goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "for example , the outer gap starts from the null - charge density of the goldreich - julian charge density , if the gap is vacuum . on the other hand",
    ", the inner boundary will locate on the stellar surface , if the electric current created inside the gap is @xmath51 in units of the goldreich - julian value , @xmath52 .      in this paper",
    ", we assume that the inclination angle of the magnetic pole is less than 90 degree .",
    "in such a case , the positive electric field along the magnetic field line accelerates the positrons towards light cylinder and electrons towards the stellar surface , respectively . in the outer gap",
    ", we can anticipate that new born pairs in the gap are immediately charge separated and are boosted to ultra - relativistic speed by the electric field along the magnetic field line ( hirotani & shibata 1999 ) ; that is , we can assume that all positrons and electrons in the outer gap move towards the light cylinder and towards the stellar surface , respectively , with the speed of light .",
    "under these conditions , the continuities of the number density of the positrons ( plus sign ) and of the electrons ( minus sign ) may be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the source term due to photon - photon pair - creation process .",
    "the electric current density per magnetic flux tube in the gap is given by @xmath55 .",
    "fixing ( @xmath42 ) , the continuity equation  ( [ conteq ] ) satisfies the current conservation along the field line , that is , @xmath56 where we normalized the current density by the local goldreich - julian value .",
    "we define the normalized current densities carried by the positrons and electrons as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . with the equation  ( [ conteq ] ) ,",
    "the solutions for @xmath59 can be written as @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 represent the positions of the inner boundary and outer boundary , respectively , and the injection current @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) represents number of positron ( or electron ) that enters the gap from the inner ( or outer ) boundary per unit time per unit area and per magnetic flux tube .",
    "the origin of the particles injected into the gap were discussed in section  [ injection ] . in terms of ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "the conservation of the electric current along the magnetic field line becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 which represents the current component carried by the created pairs in the outer gap ( hereafter we use terminology `` gap current '' to refer @xmath70 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ cons ] ) tells us that the electric current along the magnetic field line is sum of the injection currents at gap boundaries plus gap current .",
    "we note that as long as the current flows along the magnetic field line that penetrates the outer gap , the magnitude of current density per magnetic flux tube is equal to @xmath71 both outside and inside the gap .",
    "hence there is no current discontinuity along the magnetic field line . to close the current circuit",
    ", the trans - field current flow should appear in somewhere beyond the light cylinder ( shibata 1991 , 1995 ) . in this paper , since the structure of the magnetosphere outside the light cylinder is beyond out of scope , we just assume that the cross - field region is far from the outer boundary , and that the injected electrons cross the outer boundary along the magnetic field line .",
    "actual values for the total current @xmath72 , injected currents @xmath65 and @xmath66 should be solved with the complicated physics ( e.g. energy - angular loss relation among the polar cap accelerator , outer gap and pulsar wind region , shibata 1991 ) of the global pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for example , the injection current @xmath65 might be solved together with the outer gap activity and positron re - emission from the neutron star surface , which is related to the charge redistribution over the polar cap region . as we discussed in section  [ injection ]",

    "we can see in the figure that the calculated gap current ( @xmath121 ) increases as increase of the height from the lower boundary ( last - open field line ) , and that there is a maximum value of the gap current ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this is because the gamma - rays propagate in the convex side of the magnetic field lines . around the upper boundary , the gap current decreases because the electric field decreases there and because the gamma - rays emitted at lower region do not illuminate upper region of the gap . in the figure  [ map ] ,",
    "the gap current therefore becomes maximum at around 70 - 80% of the gap thickness , and the maximum gap current is @xmath123 .    in the paper , we teat @xmath124 as the model parameter .",

    "we start the calculation by solving the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) for a _ vacuum _ outer gap with a very _ thin _ thickness . using the calculated electric field along the magnetic field line , we calculate the terminal lorentz factor ( [ gamma ] ) at the each calculation grid .",
    "given the injection current , @xmath118 , we solve the continuity equation ( [ conteq ] ) with the curvature radiation and pair - creation processes , and then we obtain new distribution of the charge density inside the gap . with the new charge distribution , we solve the poisson equation to update the electric field , which subsequently modifies the charge density distribution .",
    "we iterate this procedure until all physical quantities converge .    if the gap thickness is too thin , the magnitude of the electric field is not enough high to boost the electrons / positrons up to ultra - relativistic speed , and the pair - creation cascade does not initiate in the gap . as a next step , therefore , we increase the thickness of the gap . for a fixed magnetic azimuth , the gap current @xmath70 has a distribution in the direction of the latitude @xmath26 , as figure  [ map ] indicates .",
    "if the maximum current density at fixed magnetic azimuth is smaller than @xmath131 ( for @xmath113 ) , we slightly increase the gap height .",
    "the increase of the gap height produces the increase of the accelerating electric field and results in the increase of the gap current .",
    "we solve the outer gap dynamics with new upper boundary and obtain new distribution of the gap current .",
    "updating the gap upper boundary step by step , we finally obtain the desired gap structure for the fixed injection current @xmath118 .    in the model , the trans - field thickness of the outer gap is a function of the magnetic azimuth @xmath27 , and the gap thickness is the minimum at around the magnetic meridian @xmath29 .",

    "the gap thickness becomes minimum around the magnetic meridian .",
    "if the pair - creation rate is very low , the outer gap can become very thick .",

    "for the outer gap accelerator , the electrons and/or positrons that enter the gap from the inner and/or outer boundary control the gap structure and characteristic of the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we found that if rate of the particle injection at the gap boundaries fluctuate with time , the gamma - ray spectrum from the outer gap forms a sub - exponential cut - off feature .",
    "this model predicts that the emissions above 10gev originate from a thicker outer gap with a small injection current , which also provides a theoretical explanation why the second peak is more prominent in higher energy bands . the observed gamma - ray spectrum below cut - off energy tends to be softer for the pulsar with a higher spin down rate .",
    "this observed tendency is explained if a larger rate of the particle injection is more frequent for a higher spin down pulsar .",
    "the class ii millisecond pulsars are very unique gamma - ray emitting pulsars .",
    "observed pulsed emission in radio / x - ray / gamma - ray bands and giant radio pulses probably originate from single site or neighbouring regions in outer magnetosphere .",
    "a large injection into the outer gap and subsequent pair - creation cascade of the class ii millisecond pulsar will create copious pairs outside outer gap , which would enable to develop a plasma process for the radio emission .",
    "we expect that future studies for the evolution of the gamma - ray emission properties with the spin down power and the correlation of the radio / x - ray / gamma - ray emissions of the class ii millisecond pulsars advance in understanding for nature of the multi - wavelength emission processes in the pulsar magnetosphere .",

    "<S> we explore a non - stationary outer gap scenario for gamma - ray emission process in pulsar magnetosphere . electrons / positrons that migrate along the magnetic field line and enter the outer gap from the outer / inner boundaries activate the pair - creation cascade and high - energy emission process . in our model , the rate of the particle injection at the gap boundaries is key physical quantity to control the gap structure and properties of the gamma - ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> our model assumes that the injection rate is time variable and the observed gamma - ray spectrum are superposition of the emissions from different gap structures with different injection rates at the gap boundaries . the calculated spectrum superposed by assuming power law distribution of the particle injection rate can reproduce sub - exponential cut - off feature in the gamma - ray spectrum observed by fermi - lat . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the phase - averaged spectra for 43 young / middle - age pulsars and 14 millisecond pulsars with the model . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that ( 1 ) a larger particle injection at the gap boundaries is more frequent for the pulsar with a larger spin down power and ( 2 ) outer gap with an injection rate much smaller than the goldreich - julian value produces observed @xmath0gev emissions . </S>",
    "<S> fermi - lat gamma - ray pulsars show that ( i ) the observed gamma - ray spectrum below cut - off energy tends to be softer for the pulsar with a higher spin down rate and ( ii ) the second peak is more prominent in higher energy bands . based on the results of the fitting , we describe possible theoretical interpretations for these observational properties . </S>",
