    "doped vanadium perovskites show a very rich behavior that has been mainly explored by experimentalists during the last decade .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the high - t@xmath4 cuprates,@xcite the perovskite vanadates represent quite generally systems with an active orbital degree of freedom.@xcite the particular excitement with the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskite mother compounds , where @xmath5=lu , yb,@xmath6,la , is the quantum interplay of spin - orbital degrees of freedom , @xcite which is only under partial control of weak jahn - teller ( jt ) and other couplings.@xcite the moderate coupling to the lattice results from the @xmath0 character of the outer valence electrons , @xcite and explains that the orbital quantum dynamics is not quenched  a property vanadates share with other transition metal oxides like for example titanates@xcite and iridates.@xcite the phase diagrams of doped vanadates@xcite deduced from the resistivity , specific heat and magnetic measurements show a systematic decrease of magnetic interactions and the onset of the metallic behavior only at rather high doping,@xcite in contrast , for instance , to the high-@xmath7 cuprates where the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is found at a few percent of hole doping.@xcite in la@xmath1sr@xmath2vo@xmath3 , perhaps the most investigated doped vanadium oxide , the mit is at @xmath8 sr doping,@xcite while y@xmath1ca@xmath2vo@xmath3 is insulating up to @xmath9.@xcite this latter compound undergoes a transition from the @xmath10 phase to the @xmath11 phase@xcite at rather low doping @xmath12 within the insulating phase .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite that the double exchange@xcite is the mechanism responsible for this transition in antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases , similar to the transition from the @xmath13-type af ( @xmath13-af ) to @xmath14-type af ( @xmath14-af ) order in electron doped manganites.@xcite in addition , the change of superexchange interaction in the vicinity of the holes@xcite bound to the defects has a strong influence on the relative energy of these states.@xcite remarkably the @xmath11 spin - orbital order persists up to the mit .",
    "the evolution of optical spectra with doping for these two vanadium perovskites,@xcite la@xmath1sr@xmath2vo@xmath3 and y@xmath1ca@xmath2vo@xmath3 , shows that the defects lead to impurity states which are responsible for an absorption band deep inside the mott - hubbard ( mh ) gap.@xcite this suggests that bound small polarons are the cause of the mit even at high doping concentrations.@xcite it is eventually the growth of the mid - infrared absorption under increasing doping and the gradual shift of this absorption toward zero energy , which accompanies the mit .",
    "these experimental findings call for a theoretical approach that would address the nature of defects and the changes in the magnetic and orbital structure induced by them in a mott insulator . doping in combination with strong correlations leads to spectral weight transfer,@xcite while on the other hand the size of the mh gap is not significantly influenced by doping.@xcite we discuss these issues in the present paper and point out that the defect states here should be distinguished from those observed within the mh gap in other circumstances such as the excitonic states in licuvo@xmath15,@xcite or the states generated simply by doping an orbitally ordered mott insulator in absence of defects.@xcite    the description of defect states in systems with strongly correlated electrons is an outstanding problem in the theory of condensed matter , @xcite and has been addressed mainly within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approach,@xcite and the methods based on density functional theory.@xcite it involves for example questions like : ( i ) what is the nature of defect states in a strongly correlated system , i.e. , as compared to defects in usual semiconductors or insulators ?",
    "@xcite ( ii ) what happens to the mh gap in the presence of defects ?",
    "( iii ) which are the new features in orbital degenerate mh insulators , as for example in the @xmath0 transition metal oxides with active orbital degree of freedom , in contrast to doped high - t@xmath4 superconductors ?",
    "( iv ) which are practicable methods to perform reliable calculations for mh insulators that can be extended to take into account defects and disorder ?",
    "the answer to all these questions is a formidable challenge as the defects may strongly affect the subtle interplay of several essential degrees of freedom , namely spin , orbital , lattice and charge , as we shall see below .",
    "it is remarkable that the theoretical analysis of doping in transition metal oxides , including manganites and also superconducting cuprates , is usually performed in the metallic regime where the effect of doping on the properties of a material with strongly correlated electrons leads solely to the modification of the electronic filling in party filled @xmath16 orbitals.@xcite this simplification is not possible in the insulating regime where local defect fields are not screened , leading to defect states , as for example in the case of ca defects in the lattice of y ions in y@xmath1ca@xmath2vo@xmath3.@xcite here , we explore further this idea and analyze a model with three @xmath0 orbital flavors .",
    "this is a generalization of the frequently used two - flavor model ( with active @xmath17 orbitals ) for @xmath5vo@xmath3 compounds,@xcite motivated by earlier electronic structure studies.@xcite the first electron at each v@xmath18 ion occupies the @xmath19 orbital , with energy lowered by the crystal field , while the second one occupies one of two degenerate orbitals , either the @xmath20 or @xmath21 , resulting in an @xmath22 local configuration .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a systematic unbiased approach that allows one to study defect states in strongly correlated materials . as we show below , the interactions , which arise by introducing charged defects into a mott insulator ,",
    "are numerous and all of them are necessary in a realistic approach that is capable of predicting experimental behavior of a doped material . we adopt here a multiband hubbard model@xcite that is supplemented by several terms responsible for the influence of the lattice and defect states on the electronic structure .",
    "we use it below for the description of @xmath0 electrons and generalize thereby earlier approaches.@xcite the electronic structure will be analyzed using the unrestricted hf approximation , @xcite which is known to be reliable in systems with spontaneously broken symmetry , for instance for states with magnetic order in multiband models for manganites,@xcite cuo@xmath23 planes of high temperature superconductors,@xcite and low - dimensional cuprates,@xcite and may serve to describe complex types of order such as stripe or spiral structures.@xcite as we demonstrate below , charged defects are the source of impurity states which appear as new features within the mh gap , while the mh gap itself is essentially unaffected in the low doping regime.@xcite hence the defect states are responsible for the in - gap absorption in the optical conductivity at low doping . at the same time , we demonstrate that the hf method used here is well designed to treat simultaneously phenomena that arise at distinct energy scales , the high energy @xmath24 ev related to the ( on - site and intersite ) coulomb interaction around the defect states and the low energy scale @xmath25 ev that is related to the orbital physics and controls electronic transport in doped materials .",
    "the problem addressed here pertains to general transition metal oxides with perovskite or layered structure , which feature a variety of interesting phenomena due to strong electron correlations .",
    "they include mits in undoped systems , several phenomena with long - range ( lr ) coherence in doped systems , such as high-@xmath7 superconductivity , @xcite colossal magnetoresistance , phases with magnetic and orbital order , and so on .",
    "in particular , the doped manganese oxides with colossal magnetoresistance show several magnetic phase transitions @xcite that have attracted a broad interest in the interplay between spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom in strongly correlated electron systems . in this class of systems ,",
    "orbitals couple strongly to the lattice and this coupling supports the superexchange,@xcite leading to well separated energy scales for the structural and magnetic transition.@xcite in contrast , the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites are a challenge for the theory of spin - orbital systems as the magnetic and orbital order occur here in the same range of temperatures , or even simultaneously as in lavo@xmath3.@xcite    a common feature of the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites is the onset of the @xmath13-type alternating orbital ( @xmath13-ao ) order below the characteristic orbital ordering temperature @xmath26 , which is in these compounds relatively low , @xmath27 k , and exhibits non - monotonous dependence on the ionic radius of @xmath5 ions.@xcite the temperature @xmath26 comes close to the nel temperature @xmath28 k for the magnetic transition to the @xmath14-type antiferromagnetic ( @xmath14-af ) phase .",
    "this phase competes with another af phase in the @xmath5vo@xmath3 systems with small radii of @xmath5 ions.@xcite in such cases , this latter @xmath10 phase is stable at low temperature , while the former @xmath11 phase takes over when temperature increases .",
    "the best known example of this behavior is yvo@xmath3 with a transition temperature @xmath29 k. it has been shown in ref . that relativistic spin - orbit interaction is important to describe the reorientation of spins associated with the two different types of order at this 1st order phase transition . a remarkable reversal of the magnetization direction @xcite inside the cg - phase with increasing temperature",
    "could not be understood in the theory until now .",
    "the principal difficulty in the theory of the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites is the quantum interplay of spin - orbital degrees of freedom,@xcite which manifests itself in leading contributions that emerge due to spin - orbital entanglement.@xcite quantum effects associated with joint spin - orbital dynamics play a role at zero and at finite temperatures@xcite and the consequences have been observed in several experiments:@xcite ( i ) the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weights , @xcite ( ii ) the apparent breakdown of goodenough - kanamori rules for magnetic interactions in the @xmath11 phase [ unlike in other orbitally degenerate systems , ferromagnetic ( fm ) interactions are here stronger than the af ones],@xcite ( iii ) the orbital - peierls dimerization of fm interactions in the @xmath14-af phase@xcite observed in the neutron scattering in yvo@xmath3,@xcite and also in lavo@xmath3,@xcite as well as ( iv ) the interplay between the spin and orbital correlations , which lead to the phase diagram of the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites.@xcite the peierls instability of fm chains towards dimerization occurs when spin and orbital degrees of freedom are entangled at finite temperature,@xcite and a previous theoretical study showed that charged defects favor orbital - peierls dimerization in the small doping regime.@xcite furthermore orbital fluctuations and their competition with orbital - lattice coupling play a crucial role for the explanation of the observed non - monotonous dependence of the orbital transition temperature on the radius @xmath30 of @xmath5 ions along the @xmath5vo@xmath3 series.@xcite other studies support the picture of strong orbital fluctuations and their decisive impact on the observed physical properties .",
    "@xcite we show below that in spite of the above quantum nature of the spin - orbital order in the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites , the hf approach is well designed to capture the essential features of charge defects .",

    "the appendix highlights the importance of fock terms in the present problem and addresses the concept of optimized orbitals in the vicinity of a charge defect .",

    "this effective model includes only @xmath0 orbitals at vanadium ions v@xmath18 , coupled by effective @xmath36 hopping elements along v  o  v bonds .",
    "below , we consider how this picture is modified in presence of charged defects and , in particular , when not only the electron density within the @xmath0 orbitals of vanadium ions changes , but also the presence of ca defects introduces local interactions acting on @xmath0 electrons at vanadium ions in their vicinity .",
    "the multiband hamiltonian that describes the mh physics of quasi - degenerate @xmath0 electrons and the perturbations by the defect potentials consists quite generally of one - electron terms @xmath37 and two - electron ( coulomb and jt ) interactions @xmath38 : @xmath39 the one - electron part ( [ h0 ] ) is composed of the following terms : ( i ) the kinetic energy ( @xmath40 ) , ( ii ) crystal - field ( cf ) splitting ( @xmath41 ) , and ( iii ) the perturbations generated by defects ( @xmath42 ) . here",
    ", @xmath42 includes two terms : @xmath43 the coulomb potentials of the charged impurities @xmath44 and the orbital polarization term @xmath45 .",
    "these two terms arise due to the presence of ca defects , and they constitute effective fields that act on the vanadium ions in the neighborhood of defects .",

    "in the case of @xmath5vo@xmath34 perovskites considered here , the local coulomb interactions are quite strong and lead to a mott insulator with high spin ( @xmath50 ) and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite depending on the parameters , the interactions in @xmath38 support a particular type of symmetry - broken phase,@xcite and one expects coexisting spin and orbital order , either in the form of the @xmath11 or @xmath10 phase , in agreement with experimental observations.@xcite    the kinetic energy describes the hopping processes between nearest neighbor v@xmath18 sites on bonds @xmath51 oriented along one of three cubic directions @xmath52 in the perovskite lattice , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the electron creation operator at the v@xmath18 ion at site @xmath55 , with orbital flavor @xmath56 and spin @xmath57 .",

    "the effective hopping @xmath59 originates from two subsequent @xmath60 hopping processes via the intermediate o@xmath61 orbital along each v  o  v bond .",
    "it follows from the charge - transfer model with @xmath62 hybridization @xmath63 and charge - transfer energy @xmath64,@xcite that @xmath59 is finite only between two identical @xmath0 orbitals , labeled @xmath65 , that are active along a given bond @xmath58 .",
    "the third orbital , which lies in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath66 axis , is inactive as the hopping processes vanish here by symmetry .",

    "the defect terms in @xmath83 , eq .

    "certainly it requires reliable approximations to deal with strong correlations and disorder simultaneously .",
    "the hf approach is an efficient scheme which maps the interacting electron problem onto the problem of a single particle moving in a self - consistently determined field that stems from all other electrons .",
    "whether the hf approach is indeed such a reliable scheme that fulfils the requirements stated above is the central topic of this paper .    before designing this calculation scheme we would like to emphasize the following aspects ( see also the appendix ) :",
    "+ ( i ) it has been shown@xcite that a hf factorization when applied to a two - orbital model is capable to describe both the mh gap and the defect states emerging from the lower hubbard band due to the defects .",
    "even more important , the typical multiplet splitting of the transition metal ions is obtained if the factorization is performed with respect to an optimal local basis set , i.e. , with occupation numbers either close to 1 or to 0 .",
    "that is , the local spin - orbital states should be either occupied or empty .",
    "+ ( ii ) this requirement leads to complications in the vicinity of defects . in particular charge defects",
    "lead to a rotation of the occupied local states , see sec .",
    "[ sec : atom ] , due to the coulomb potential of a charged defect .",
    "+ ( iii ) in principle , a local rotation can be specified that removes the off - diagonal terms and defines a new optimal local basis , i.e. , orbitals having again integer occupancies ( close to 1 or 0 ) . this simple scheme , however , is not successful in presence of kinetic energy terms . here",
    "the optimal local or wannier type orbitals are influenced not only by local rotation terms , but by these nonlocal terms as well .",
    "+ ( iv ) it is important to recognize that the full unrestricted hf scheme , i.e. , including all relevant off - diagonal contributions from interactions , can be used to determine the mh - split bands in presence of defects .",
    "we will show here that this also holds true for the three - flavor case .",
    "in particular , we will show by comparison with ed that the approach provides a surprisingly good description not only of occupied states , but also of the unoccupied higher multiplet states .",
    "+ ( v ) moreover , the local rotated basis may serve as an intermediate basis and allows one to understand more easily the new features emerging due to the defects .",
    "for example , due to local rotation of @xmath0 orbitals the flavor conservation in hopping processes that contribute to the kinetic energy is lifted in the rotated basis .",
    "that is , in the vicinity of defects , orbital flavors mix not only due to local orbital rotation ( off - diagonal cf terms ) , but also due to the kinetic energy .    except for a special attention to all relevant off - diagonal fock terms ,",
    "the unrestricted hf procedure applied here is a standard approach for tight binding models of interacting electrons.@xcite in general , one decouples each term describing a two - particle interaction and replaces it by all possible one - particle terms coupled to certain effective mean fields  density terms in the hartree approximation ( ha ) , supplemented by off - diagonal fock terms in the hf approximation .",
    "such expressions are augmented by double - counting correction terms , which are necessary to avoid double counting of the interaction energy .",
    "we will adopt just hartree terms in only two cases : ( i ) when the interaction simulates a potential of the lattice and fock terms would simply be out of scope ( as for the jt terms ) , and ( ii ) when there is no one - particle term in the original hamiltonian that can act as a source potential for the related off - diagonal mean fields ( e.g. @xmath47 with respect to spin degree of freedom ) . note that the jt terms simulate the potential acting on pairs of neighboring v@xmath18 ions due to lattice distortions and discriminating between the orbital flavors in the doublet @xmath77 .    as a matter of fact",
    ", fock terms become active only if their off - diagonal mean fields are finite .",

    "this simple scheme is not applicable when some nonlocal terms are present ( as e.g. the kinetic energy term ) .",
    "yet , it is important to recognize that the unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) ( and not hartree ) scheme , i.e. , including the relevant off - diagonal contributions from ( local and non - local ) interactions , can be used to determine the mott - hubbard split bands in the presence of defects .",
    "we have found that this also holds true for the three - flavor case . in particular , we have shown , by comparison with exact diagonalization , that the hf approach provides a surprisingly faithful description not only of the occupied , but also of the unoccupied higher multiplet states .",
    "it is the latter aspect that is particularly surprising here as it is known that the hf approach is designed to describe the occupied states in the best possible way , while for the unoccupied states one expects a considerably poorer description ( e.g. electron affinities ) .",
    "basic features of the character of wave functions and excitation spectra , which reflect the interplay of strong correlations and the orbital polarization field @xmath184 due to a defect , are already well represented by the hf study of a single ion or a bond embedded into the electronic structure of a large cluster reflecting the mott insulator with spin - orbital order .",
    "these studies and their comparison with exact diagonalization allow us to conclude that the hf calculation describes well : ( i ) the effect of the orbital polarization on the wave functions in the three - flavor case , and ( ii ) the multiplet structure for an atom ( sec .",
    "[ sec : atom ] ) . a further investigation for an embedded bond ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bond ] ) highlights the interplay of the orbital polarization field @xmath184 and the kinetic energy .",
    "comparison of the hf results for partial densities and excitation spectra ( i.e. , photoemission and inverse photoemission ) with exact diagonalization data shows good agreement in the whole @xmath184 range .",
    "an exception are extremely small values of @xmath184 , where the exact wave function is entangled , a feature that can not be captured within the hf .",
    "a particularly good agreement between the hf and exact diagonalization is obtained for the binding energy basically for all values of @xmath408 ev .",
    "the binding energy for the @xmath11 phase is found to be much larger than that for the @xmath10 phase .",
    "this higher binding energy , together with the double exchange mechanism realized on ferromagnetic bonds , is responsible for the increasing stability of the @xmath11 phase on increasing the doping and leads to the experimentally observed magnetic phase transition in y@xmath1ca@xmath2vo@xmath3 at very low doping , @xmath12.@xcite    the description of doped carriers in mott insulators , such as in the @xmath409vo@xmath3 compounds ( @xmath5=y , la and @xmath381=ca , sr , etc . ) or in lavo@xmath3/srvo@xmath3 superlattices,@xcite is a computational challenge due to the interplay of strong correlations , defect - induced local deformations of the wave functions and spin - orbital order .",
    "it is evident that to deal with strong correlations and defects , for sufficiently large systems , requires carefully chosen approximations . in this work",
    ", we have shown that the unrestricted hf method fulfils all essential requirements .",
    "in particular , we have seen that even the unoccupied states at high energy , i.e. , those reflecting the multiplet structure of the mott insulator at orbital degeneracy , are well described in a doped system .",
    "the same holds true for the perturbed electronic structure in the vicinity of the charged defects .",
    "the hf approach is an efficient scheme which maps the interacting electron problem onto the problem of a single particle moving in a self - consistently determined field of the other electrons .",
    "therefore , it is applicable for large systems , systems with defects , heterostructures and interfaces . very relevant for the success of the method in describing mott insulators",
    "are the broken symmetries reflecting the underlying spin - orbital order .",
    "fortunately , the spin - orbital order in @xmath409vo@xmath3 compounds persists up to the metal - insulator transition , thus the assumption of spin - orbital order in the unrestricted hf scheme is here fully justified .    having shown that the hf approach provides a faithful description of excited states of single defects in systems with broken symetries",
    ", we investigated the electronic structure of an @xmath167 cluster for finite defect concentrations in the dilute doping regime .",
    "the aim here is to resolve the complex nature of defect states and their manifestation in the excitation spectra .",
    "a single @xmath381 defect , for example a divalent @xmath381 ion in @xmath409vo@xmath3 , adds a hole into the @xmath0 shell of v(@xmath16 ) states . in the dilute limit , this hole is not freely moving but is pinned by the charge of the defect essentially to a cube of v ions surrounding the defect @xmath381 in its center .",
    "the present study demonstrates that the excitation spectra of the intrinsic , orbital - degenerate mott insulator are strongly modified by adding defects .",
    "we address here only some points relevant for experimental studies .",
    "an important observation is that the fundamental excitations , such as the mott - gap and the multiplet energies , are not affected by doping in the dilute regime .",
    "the defects generate defect states inside the mott - hubbard gap , as observed.@xcite due to the intrinsic doping , the chemical potential lies inside the defect band .",
    "the spectral weight of defect states is taken from the lhb .",
    "we have argued that the in - gap absorption observed in the optical conductivity experiments performed for several doped vanadate systems can be identified with these states .",
    "moreover , we observe in the hf excitation spectra for the @xmath11 phase a transport gap inside the defect band , which corresponds to the removal of an electron at one defect and the addition at another defect in the neighborhood . in the absence of electron - electron interactions ,",
    "this gap is essentially determined by a bonding - antibonding splitting resulting from the @xmath71-axis kinetic energy of a doped hole confined by the defect .",
    "the inclusion of lr coulomb interactions between electrons @xmath410 leads to an approximately linear increase of the transport gap with @xmath126 .",
    "thus , these interactions promote the transport gap to a coulomb gap . combining coulomb interactions and the mechanism of orbital polarization",
    "we find a reduction of the size of the coulomb gap .",
    "this can be considered as screening in the vicinity of the localized defect , i.e. , screening contained already at the hf level .",
    "an important motivation of this work was the study of the three - flavor case , particularly in connection with defects in the @xmath5vo@xmath3 perovskites .",
    "usually spin - orbital order in the perovskite vanadates is discussed in terms of a simplified two - flavor ( @xmath77 ) model .",
    "@xcite we have shown here that defects lead indeed to a strong change of occupied orbitals , e.g. the occupied @xmath71-orbitals , in the vicinity of charged defects due to orbital polarization .",
    "yet , we have also shown that the topmost occupied local orbitals , i.e. , the orbitals that are relevant for the doped holes , are mainly of @xmath77-character as in the two - flavor description .",
    "it is this latter observation that leads to the conclusion that the interaction of doped holes and the spin - orbital degrees of freedom are in fact similar in the two models .",
    "summarizing , the central result of this paper is establishing that the unrestricted hf approach is well designed to describe the electronic structure of charged defects in doped transition metal oxides with active orbital degrees of freedom , in presence of strong electron correlations .",
    "the present study provides valuable insights into the changes of the electronic structure in doped mott - hubbard systems under doping .",
    "while the positions of the hubbard subbands are not affected by doping , their spectral intensity changes and new defect states occur within the mott - hubbard gap .",
    "these new states are observed in the optical spectroscopy and their weight increases with doping .",
    "finally , we remark that the hf approach represents a natural basis for a subsequent many - body perturbative treatment .",
    "it should be noted that the unrestricted hf method already provides the mott - hubbard gap and the higher energy multiplet excitations .",
    "thus , the proper many - body treatment would start from a reasonable slater determinant , which reflects the correlated electronic structure of the spin - orbital ordered mott insulator .",
    "we have shown that the fundamental mott gap is correctly described by the hf in the framework of the multiband hubbard model .",
    "therefore , the many - body treatment will hardly affect the mott - hubbard gap , yet it may further improve higher multiplets , and it will certainly contribute to the screening of the long - range coulomb interactions and lead to an extra reduction of the coulomb gap in the defect states .",

    "the remarkable successes of the lda+@xmath33 approach@xcite in describing the various aspects of the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials,@xcite including the magnetic order and the mh gaps , suggest that the hartree ( or mean field ) approximation for the electron - electron interactions in the appropriate orbital basis could be sufficient to design an efficient and realistic scheme to determine the electronic structure .",
    "this experience , however , is based on undoped systems , where the occupation numbers for the _ atomic _ orbitals ( such as @xmath0 or @xmath411 orbitals at transition metal ions in the correlated oxides ) used in the lda+@xmath33 calculations are either close to 1 or close to 0 .",
    "this latter condition is actually necessary to produce an essentially correct multiplet splitting , i.e. , these orbitals are already the properly chosen orbitals to implement the electron interactions in the hartree scheme .",
