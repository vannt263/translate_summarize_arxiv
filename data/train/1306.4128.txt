    "during the last two decades , blind source separation ( bss ) has attracted an important interest . the main idea of bss",
    "consists of finding the transmitted signals without using pilot sequences or a priori knowledge on the propagation channel .",
    "using bss in communication systems has the main advantage of eliminating training sequences , which can be expensive or impossible in some practical situations , leading to an increased spectral efficiency .",
    "several bss criteria have been proposed in the literature e.g. @xcite .",
    "the cm criterion is probably the best known and most studied higher order statistics based criterion in blind equalization @xcite and signal separation @xcite areas .",
    "it exploits the fact that certain communication signals have the constant modulus property , as for example phase modulated signals . the constant modulus algorithm ( cma )",
    "was developed independently by @xcite and was initially designed for psk signals .",
    "the cma principle consists of preventing the deviation of the squared modulus of the outputs at the receiver from a constant .",
    "the main advantages of cma , among others , are its simplicity , robustness , and the fact that it can be applied even for non - constant modulus communication signals .",
    "many solutions to the minimization of the cm criterion have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cm criterion was first minimized via adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm ( sga ) @xcite and later on many variants have been devised .",
    "it is known , in adaptive filtering , that the convergence rate of the sga is slow . to improve the latter , the authors in @xcite proposed an implementation of the cm criterion via the recursive least squares ( rls ) algorithm .",
    "the author in @xcite proposed to rewrite the cm criterion as a least squares problem , which is solved using an iterative algorithm named least squares cma ( ls - cma ) . in @xcite , the authors proposed an algebraic solution for the minimization of the cm criterion .",
    "the proposed algorithm is named analytical cma ( acma ) and consists of computing all the separators , at one time , through solving a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the main advantage of acma is that , in the noise free case , it provides the exact solution , using only few samples ( the number of samples must be greater than or equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of transmitting antennas ) .",
    "moreover , the performance study of acma showed that it converges asymptotically to the wiener receiver @xcite .",
    "however , the main drawback of acma is its numerical complexity especially for a large number of transmitting antennas . an adaptive version of acma was also developed in @xcite . more generally , an abundant literature on the cm - like criteria and the different algorithms used to minimize them exists including references @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we propose two algorithms to minimize the cm criterion .",
    "the first one , referred to as givens cma ( g - cma ) , performs prewhitening in order to make the channel matrix unitary then , it applies successive givens rotations to find the resulting matrix through minimization of the cm criterion . for large number of samples , prewhitening is effective and the transformed channel matrix is very close to unitary , however , for small sample sizes , it is not , and hence results in significant performance loss .",
    "in order to compensate the effect of the ineffective prewhitening stage , we propose to use shear rotations @xcite .",
    "shear rotations are non - unitary hyperbolic transformations which allow to reduce departure from normality .",
    "we note that the authors in @xcite used givens and shear rotations in the context of joint diagonalization of matrices .",
    "we thus propose a second algorithm , referred to as hyperbolic g - cma ( hg - cma ) , that uses unitary givens rotations in conjunction with non - unitary shear rotations .",
    "the optimal parameters of both complex shear and givens rotations are computed via minimization of the cm criterion .",
    "the proposed algorithms have a lower computational complexity as compared to the acma .",
    "moreover , unlike the acma which requires a number of samples greater than the square of the number of transmitting antennas , g - cma and hg - cma do not impose such a condition .",
    "finally , we propose an adaptive implementation of the hg - cma using sliding window which has the advantages of fast convergence and good separation quality for a moderate computational cost comparable to that of the methods in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : formulation ] introduces the problem formulation and assumptions . in sections [ sec : gcma ] and",
    "[ sec : hgcma ] , we introduce the g - cma and hg - cma , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : ahgcma ] is dedicated to the adaptive implementation of the hg - cma . some numerical results and discussion",
    "are provided in section [ sec : results ] , and conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider the following multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) memoryless system model with @xmath1 transmit and @xmath2 receive antennas : @xmath3 where @xmath4^{t}$ ] is the @xmath5 source vector , @xmath6^{t}$ ] is the @xmath7 additive noise vector , @xmath8 represents the @xmath9 mimo channel matrix , and @xmath10^{t}$ ] is the @xmath7 received vector .    in the sequel",
    ", we assume that the channel matrix @xmath8 is full column rank ( and hence @xmath11 ) , the source signals are discrete valued ( i.e. , generated from a finite alphabet ) , zero - mean , independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) , mutually independent random processes , and the noise is additive white independent from the source signals .",
    "note that these assumptions are quite mild and generally satisfied in communication applications .",
    "our main goal is to recover the source signals blindly , i.e. , using only the received data . for this purpose , we need to compute an @xmath12 separation ( receiver ) matrix @xmath13 such that @xmath14 results in the source signals , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16^{t}$ ] is the @xmath17 vector of the estimated source signals , @xmath18 is the @xmath19 global system matrix and @xmath20 is the filtered noise at the receiver output .",
    "ideally , in bss , matrix @xmath13 separates the source signals except for a possible permutation and up to scalar factors , i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a permutation matrix and @xmath23 is a non - singular diagonal matrix .    in the sequel",
    ", we propose to use the well known cma to achieve the desired bss .",
    "in other words , we propose to estimate the separation matrix by minimizing the cm criterion : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26th entry of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 $ ] ( @xmath29 being the sample size ) .",
    "this cm criterion has been used by many authors and has been shown to lead to the desired source separation for cm signals and large sample sizes as stated below .",
    "if @xmath29 is large enough such that columns of matrix @xmath30 $ ] include all possible combinations of source vectors @xmath31 , then the criterion @xmath32 ( where @xmath13 is such that @xmath33 is non singular ) is minimized if and only if @xmath13 satisfies : @xmath34 or , in the absence of noise : @xmath35 where @xmath22 is an @xmath19 permutation matrix and @xmath23 is an @xmath19 diagonal non - singular matrix .",
    "the proof can easily be derived from that of theorem @xmath36 in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we propose a new algorithm , referred to as g - cma , based on givens rotations , for the minimization of the cm criterion .",
    "it is made up of two stages :    1 .",
    "_ prewhitening : _ the prewhitening stage allows to convert the arbitrary channel matrix into a unitary one . hence , this reduces finding an arbitrary separation matrix to finding a unitary one @xcite . moreover , prewhitening has the advantage of reducing vector size ( data compression ) in the case where @xmath37 and avoiding trivial undesired solutions .",
    "givens rotations : _ after prewhitening , the new channel matrix is unitary and can therefore be computed via successive givens rotations .",
    "here , we propose to compute the optimal parameters of these rotations through minimizing the cm criterion .",
    "the prewhitening matrix @xmath38 can be computed by using the classical eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of the received signal @xmath39 ( often , it is computed as the inverse square root of the data covariance matrix , @xmath40 @xcite ) .",
    "the whitened signal can then be written as : @xmath41 therefore , assuming the noise free case and that the prewhitening matrix @xmath38 is computed using the exact covariance matrix , we have : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an @xmath19 unitary matrix . from ( [ eq08 ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that , in order to find the source signals , it is sufficient to find the unitary matrix @xmath44 and hence the separator can simply be expressed as : @xmath45 , which , in the absence of noise , results in @xmath46 .",
    "now , to minimize the cm criterion in ( [ eq04 ] ) w.r.t . to matrix @xmath44 , we propose an iterative algorithm where @xmath44 is rewritten using givens rotations . indeed , in jacobi - like algorithms @xcite , the unitary matrix @xmath44 can be decomposed into product of elementary complex givens rotations @xmath47 such that : @xmath48 where @xmath49 refers to the number of sweeps ( iterations ) and the givens rotation matrix @xmath47 is a unitary matrix where all diagonal elements are one except for two elements @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ". likewise , all off - diagonal elements of @xmath47 are zero except for two elements @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "elements @xmath54 , and @xmath51 are given by : @xmath55 & = & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\cos ( \\theta ) & e^{\\jmath \\alpha }   \\sin(\\theta ) \\\\-e^{-\\jmath \\alpha }   \\sin(\\theta ) & \\cos(\\theta)\\end{array}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to compute @xmath47 , we need to find only the rotation angles @xmath56 .",
    "the idea here is to choose the rotation angles @xmath56 such that the cm criterion @xmath57 is minimized . for this purpose ,",
    "let us consider the unitary transformation even though the latter matrix is transformed at each iteration of the proposed algorithm . ]",
    "given the structure of @xmath47 , this unitary transformation changes only the elements in rows @xmath59 and @xmath60 of @xmath61 according to : @xmath62 where @xmath63 refers to the @xmath26th entry of @xmath61 .",

    "@xmath47 are computed such that @xmath65 is minimized at each iteration . in order to minimize @xmath65",
    ", we propose to express it as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "since the application of givens rotation matrix @xmath47 to @xmath61 modifies only the two rows @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the terms that depend on @xmath56 are those corresponding to @xmath66 or @xmath67 in ( [ eq04 ] ) . considering ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , we have : @xmath68 + \\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\sum_{i=1 , i\\neq p , q}^{m }      \\big(|\\bar{y}_{ij}|^{2}-1\\big)^{2 }              \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , by considering ( [ eq11 ] ) and the following equalities : @xmath69 and after some manipulations , we obtain : @xmath70 with : @xmath71^{t}\\label{eq16}\\\\      & & \\mathbf{t}_{j}=\\big[\\frac{1}{2}\\big(|\\bar{y}_{pj}|^{2}-|\\bar{y}_{qj}|^{2}\\big),~       \\re(\\bar{y}_{pj}\\bar{y}_{qj}^{*}),~\\im(\\bar{y}_{pj}\\bar{y}_{qj}^{*})\\big]^{t}\\label{eq17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote real and imaginary parts of @xmath74 , respectively . using ( [ eq14 ] ) , we get : @xmath75 then , plugging ( [ eq18 ] ) into ( [ eq12 ] ) yields : @xmath76 given that the second and third summations in ( [ eq19 ] ) do not depend on @xmath56 , the minimization problem is equivalent to the minimization of : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . finally , the solution @xmath80 that minimizes ( [ eq20 ] ) is given by the unit norm eigenvector of @xmath81 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue eigenvalue problem that can be solved explicitly . ] .",
