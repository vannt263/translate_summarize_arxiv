    "the anderson impurity model is one of the most important and fundamental model hamiltonians in condensed - matter physics  @xcite .",
    "it was originally invented to study localized magnetic impurities in metallic environments and there exist three distinct parameter regimes called empty orbital regime , mixed valence regime , and local moment regime  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the local moment regime , where the electrical resistivity grows logarithmically toward the low temperature as a consequence of the celebrated kondo effect  @xcite . by extending the anderson impurity model , orbital degeneracy",
    "can also be incorporated  @xcite and periodic arrangement of magnetic impurities is considered to be relevant to heavy fermion physics  @xcite .",
    "further application of the anderson impurity model is possible by introducing additional degrees of freedom corresponding to left and right leads to study tunneling of electrons through a quantum dot both in and out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in fact , one degree of freedom can be decoupled by a canonical transformation and the other interacting degree of freedom turns out to be described by the original anderson impurity model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the kondo effect emerges again in quantum dot systems but now as the logarithmic growth of the electrical conductance by lowering the temperature  @xcite , where a number of beautiful observations of the kondo effect have been made  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this rapid communication is to show that all the rich physics associated with the anderson impurity model can be simulated with ultracold atoms by employing standard techniques such as magnetic - field - induced feshbach resonances , species - selective optical lattices , and laser couplings of atomic hyperfine states  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we place special emphasis on the transport measurement of the kondo effect analogous to quantum dot experiments , which should be of great importance in ultracold atom experiments because transport is usually difficult to study with the exception of recent progress made in refs .",
    "@xcite . future realization of the kondo effect and its transport measurement with ultracold atoms will pave the way for developing new insights into yet unresolved aspects of kondo physics such as the formation and dynamics of the kondo screening cloud  @xcite and the quantum criticality in heavy fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "our study is based on the simple and versatile scheme to realize the orbital kondo effect with ultracold atoms  @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for other proposals ) .",
    "the system consists of a fermi sea of spin - polarized @xmath3 fermions of species @xmath4 interacting with a spinless impurity atom of different species @xmath5 which is loaded into a ground state of an isotropic potential . by tuning the interspecies attraction with an @xmath6-wave feshbach resonance , the impurity atom and a spin - polarized fermion",
    "can form a bound molecule that occupies a degenerate orbital of the confinement potential with orbital angular momentum @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the total energy of the bound molecule coincides with the scattering threshold of the @xmath8 and @xmath5 atoms , an @xmath9th partial - wave resonance is induced and low - energy physics in its vicinity is described by a two - channel hamiltonian : @xmath10.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 creates an @xmath8 atom with energy @xmath12 , while @xmath13 creates the impurity @xmath5 atom in the ground state of the confinement potential whose energy is chosen to be zero .",
    "the bound molecule is created by @xmath14 in one of the degenerate orbitals labeled by the magnetic quantum number @xmath15 .",
    "its coupling to the @xmath8 and @xmath5 atoms is assumed to have the harmonic form of @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the wave - number cutoff @xmath17 set by an inverse characteristic extent of the confined @xmath5 atom . because only one @xmath5 atom is confined , the particle number operators of the localized @xmath5 atom and bound molecule are constrained by @xmath18",
    "when the rotational symmetry is exact , we have an equal detuning @xmath19 and coupling @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and thus the degeneracy is ( @xmath22)-fold , while we shall develop a general formulation so that it is also applicable to study the effect of symmetry breaking later .",
    "interestingly , the low - energy effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_up ] ) naturally realizable with ultracold atoms is nothing but the infinite-@xmath23 anderson impurity model in the slave - particle representation  @xcite with its fictitious degrees of freedom corresponding to our real atom and molecule as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "the empty orbital , mixed valence , and local moment regimes of the original anderson impurity model are thus translated into atomic regime ( @xmath24 ) , resonant regime ( @xmath25 ) , and molecular regime ( @xmath26 ) , respectively , in the language of ultracold atoms . in particular , the orbital kondo effect emergent in the molecular limit was elaborated for @xmath27 in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the analysis therein can be straightforwardly generalized for an arbitrary @xmath9 to find that the kondo temperature in the su(@xmath22 ) symmetric case has a universal leading exponent given by @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 being the @xmath9th partial - wave scattering length .",
    "because the kondo effect in condensed - matter systems manifests itself most sharply in their transport measurements , it is highly desired although challenging to establish an analogous transport signature of the orbital kondo effect in ultracold atom experiments .    in what follows",
    ", we indeed show that the conductance measurement of the kondo effect in quantum dot experiments can be equivalently performed with ultracold atoms by adopting the idea from ref .",
    "@xcite . to this end",
    ", we introduce another spin @xmath30 component of fermionic species @xmath4 , @xmath31 as well as the intercomponent coupling driven by a resonant laser field with the rabi frequency @xmath32 , @xmath33,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are expressed in the rotating frame .",
    "it is legitimate to assume that interactions of @xmath34 atoms with @xmath8 atoms and with the impurity @xmath5 atom are both negligible in the dilute limit because they are generally off - resonance when the interaction of @xmath8 atoms with the impurity @xmath5 atom is tuned close to a confinement - induced resonance .",
    "it is also important that the confinement - induced resonance can be turned on and off without changing the magnetic field but by controlling the potential strength acting on the impurity @xmath5 atom  @xcite . with all these setups , we are ready to propose a simple conductance measurement with ultracold atoms consisting of the following three protocols .",
    "\\(i ) preparation : we first stay away from any confinement - induced resonances so that both @xmath8 and @xmath34 atoms negligibly interact with the impurity @xmath5 atom . after introducing @xmath35 and @xmath36 numbers of @xmath8 and @xmath34 atoms ,",
    "we apply the intercomponent coupling ( [ eq : h_up - down ] ) for a duration of @xmath37 , which transforms the two spin components into two superposition states according to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , @xmath35 and @xmath36 numbers of @xmath40 and @xmath41 atoms are prepared at a common temperature @xmath42 and their corresponding chemical potentials are denoted by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "\\(ii ) transport : we now turn on the confinement - induced @xmath9th partial - wave resonance of @xmath8 atoms with the impurity @xmath5 atom . because @xmath4 atoms are prepared on the @xmath45 basis , it is appropriate to express the total hamiltonian composed of eqs .",

    "the chemical potential imbalance @xmath48 thus causes a transport of fermions from majority to minority superposition states through scatterings with the impurity @xmath5 atom  @xcite .",
    "after a period of @xmath49 , the numbers of @xmath40 and @xmath41 atoms change into @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the steady - state current .",
    "\\(iii ) measurement : we then turn off the confinement - induced resonance to terminate the transport . by applying the intercomponent coupling ( [ eq : h_up - down ] ) again but for a duration of @xmath53 , the two superposition states are transformed back into the original two spin components as @xmath54 and @xmath55 whose numbers are now @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . finally , from the measured numbers of @xmath8 and @xmath34 atoms compared to their initial values , the transported fermion number @xmath56 can be extracted to determine the conductance @xmath57 of the transport hamiltonian ( [ eq : transport ] ) .",
    "this constitutes the ultracold atom equivalent of the conductance measurement in quantum dot systems .",
    "in order to provide quantitative guides on how the orbital kondo effect emerges in the proposed conductance measurement with ultracold atoms , we study in detail the linear conductance @xmath58 of the transport hamiltonian ( [ eq : transport ] ) . with the aid of the meir - wingreen formula for the steady - state current @xmath59  @xcite ,",
    "the linear conductance is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fermi - dirac distribution function at an inverse temperature @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the retarded green s function with the expectation value taken with respect to the equilibrium state at @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 and @xmath41 atoms now have the equal chemical potential @xmath65 and thus it is advantageous to express the transport hamiltonian ( [ eq : transport ] ) on the original spin basis so that it is decoupled into eqs .",

    "( [ eq : imaginary ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : conductance ] ) now allows us to compute the linear conductance numerically for a given set of parameters .    besides the chemical potential @xmath76 and temperature @xmath42 of @xmath8 atoms , the linear conductance ( [ eq : conductance ] ) depends on the detuning @xmath19 and coupling @xmath20 as well as the wave - number cutoff @xmath17 through @xmath77 defined in eq .",

    "<S> the kondo effect in condensed - matter systems manifests itself most sharply in their transport measurements . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose an analogous transport signature of the orbital kondo effect realized with ultracold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our system consists of imbalanced fermi seas of two components of fermions and an impurity atom of different species which is confined by an isotropic potential . </S>",
    "<S> we first apply a @xmath0 pulse to transform two components of fermions into two superposition states . </S>",
    "<S> their interactions with the impurity atom then cause a `` transport '' of fermions from majority to minority superposition states , whose numbers can be measured after applying another @xmath1 pulse . in particular , when the interaction of one component of fermions with the impurity atom is tuned close to a confinement - induced @xmath2-wave or higher partial - wave resonance , the resulting conductance is shown to exhibit the kondo signature , i.e. , universal logarithmic growth by lowering the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed transport measurement will thus provide a clear evidence of the orbital kondo effect accessible in ultracold atom experiments and pave the way for developing new insights into kondo physics . </S>"
