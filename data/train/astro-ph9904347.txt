    "one requirement for measuring the hubble constant using sne ia as standard candles is a sample of well - measured distant supernovae .",
    "they should be distant enough that their measured redshifts are dominated by the hubble flow , but not so distant that the still - uncertain dynamics associated with deceleration due to the mass density of the universe and possible acceleration due to conjectured repulsive forces are important .",
    "a broad range of redshift @xmath7 from 0.01 to 0.2 is suitable , with @xmath7 about 0.05 being optimum . for this purpose",
    "the carefully measured and uniformly analyzed caln - tololo collection of 29 sne ia ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ) covering the range @xmath8 is very well - suited .",
    "the collection has a spread in relative luminosity covering more than 1.5 magnitudes , but it has been shown that a two - parameter luminosity correction using the color and decline rate of each supernova is both necessary and sufficient to standardize them to a common luminosity ( tripp 1998 ) .    a second requirement for measuring @xmath0 is to establish the absolute luminosity of sne ia that have been standardized in the above way . at the present time",
    "there are seven nearby ( typically an order of magnitude closer ) galaxies that have hosted sne  ia whose galaxy distances have been determined using cepheid variables measured by the hubble space telescope .",
    "this includes the recently discovered sn 1998bu in the leo i group galaxy ngc 3368 whose cepheid distance had already been measured .",
    "the cepheid - determined distances each have a typical accuracy of about 5% , plus an additional overall uncertainty of about 7% associated with the absolute distance scale for cepheid variables .",
    "these seven galaxies have hosted eight recorded sne ia .",
    "the oldest , sn 1895b , was observed photographically in only one color so can not be used here .",
    "three of the others preceded the use of ccds in astronomy and , despite being well - measured by the techniques of the day , are not of the quality that can now be achieved .",
    "thus we also consider an expanded list containing three more recent sne ia which , although not found in cepheid - calibrated galaxies , are very near on the sky to such a galaxy or are generally considered to be within groups of galaxies that have at least one member that has been so calibrated .",
    "results are presented both with and without these additional supernovae .",
    "an extensive bibliograpy on the use of type ia supernovae for measuring the hubble constant can be found in the recent review by branch ( 1998 ) .",
    "we treat the 29 distant sne of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) following the method of tripp ( 1998 ) , except that we allow the absolute magnitude to vary in a simultaneous fit with the cepheid - calibrated supernovae .",
    "we calculate the hubble constant @xmath0 for each distant supernova using @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the apparent and absolute blue magnitudes at maximum light , while @xmath12 is the deceleration parameter and @xmath7 is the measured red shift . for the 29 distant sne , @xmath10 and @xmath7",
    "are tabulated by hamuy et al .",
    "these supernovae are not so remote @xmath13 that the still uncertain value of @xmath12 leads to a significant uncertainty . conforming to the current evidence of riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for a negative @xmath12 , we fix it at -0.45 ( see section 4).as shown previously ( tripp 1998 ) , in order to fit the data of hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) within their quoted errors , the above absolute magnitude @xmath11 for each supernova must be adjusted according to both its rate of decline @xmath14 and its color @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath16 are the maximum apparent blue and visual magnitudes .",
    "empirically , linear dependences prove to be more than adequate for both corrections .",
    "we therefore write for @xmath11 in equation ( 1 ) @xmath17 the parameter @xmath18 incorporates both intrinsic color differences between the sne and any reddening caused by dust in the host galaxies .",
    "these two effects are often difficult to distinguish , particularly for the more distant supernovae .",
    "the reddening parameter due to dust alone , usually denoted by @xmath19 , should be about 4 if the dust surrounding extragalactic supernovae is similar to dust in the milky way .",
    "values @xmath20 due perhaps to a smaller average grain size .",
    "since sne ia are not closely associated with star formation it may well be that cirrus values are relevant for them . in any event",
    ", all sne with evidence of strong dust obscuration are removed from the sample for the case where we apply a color selection to the data . ]    the weighted average value @xmath21 in equation ( 2 ) is obtained from the cepheid - calibrated sne in the following manner .",
    "we use a similar dependence to standardize each of them to the value it would have if @xmath22 and @xmath23 for that supernova .",
    "thus the corrected absolute magnitude becomes @xmath24    a least - squares fit of the cepheid - calibrated sne gives the weighted average @xmath21 appearing in equation ( 2 ) , along with the @xmath3 for the fit .",
    "both are functions of @xmath25 and @xmath18 .",
    "the value 1.05 in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the average @xmath2 for 13 sne ia compiled by branch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . chosen for convenience ,",
    "the choice is arbitrary and has no effect on @xmath0 , although it will directly affect @xmath21 .",
    "the same remarks apply to the arbitrary choice of a @xmath26 subtraction in the color term .    for each caln - tololo distant supernova , we use equation .",
    "( 1 ) to evaluate @xmath0 using the value of @xmath11 from equation ( 2 ) with @xmath25 and @xmath18 as parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0 for each supernova is obtained by combining in quadrature the quoted errors @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 with an uncertainty in luminosity distance due to possible peculiar motion @xmath30 km / s of the host galaxy with respect to the hubble flow . neglecting correlations between errors ( since they are not reported )",
    ", we have : @xmath31 + \\left [ \\left ( { 1 \\over z } + { { 1- q_0 } \\over 2 } \\right ) \\delta z \\right ] ^2 } \\ ] ] a weighted average of the 29 values of @xmath32 then gives a least - squares value for @xmath0 along with its uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath33 for this fit of @xmath0 is added to the @xmath33 for the cepheid- calibrated sne fit of @xmath21 , both with @xmath25 and @xmath18 as parameters .",
    "these are then varied to minimize the overall @xmath33 .    when the parameters to be varied enter into the evaluation of the uncertainty @xmath6 and thus into the @xmath33 of the fit , as they do here , there is a bias favoring larger values of @xmath25 and @xmath18 leading to a larger @xmath6 and thus to a lower @xmath33 .",
    "we try to eliminate this by temporarily fixing @xmath25 and @xmath18 for the evaluation of @xmath6 in equation ( 4 ) at the first solution values , then reminimizing and again fixing them at the new values .",
    "after a few such iterations , stable values of @xmath25 and @xmath18 are found which are also @xmath3 minima . in the end , this results in a small decrease in @xmath25 , a substantial decrease in @xmath18 ( by about 0.6 unit ) , and a consequent increase in @xmath0 by about 1.3 units .",
    "in table 1 , we list the seven sne from cepheid - calibrated galaxies and the three from cepheid - calibrated galaxy groups , along with the measured values used in our fits ; these are the distance modulus @xmath34 , the measured apparent magnitude @xmath10 and the resulting absolute magnitude @xmath35 appearing in equation ( 3 ) , the decline in @xmath10 magnitude , @xmath2 , during the first 15 days after maximum , and the color , taken to be @xmath36 .",
    "where appropriate , the distance modulus incorporates the hst long - exposure correction of 0.05 as well as an estimate of the effect of host - galaxy absorption on the cepheid distance determination . conforming to the procedure used by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for their more distant sne , both @xmath10 and @xmath1 are corrected for galactic absorption using the estimates of burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) , but no correction is made for absorption within the host galaxy .",
    "our method accomodates this host - galaxy absorption as well as any intrinsic reddening with the parameter @xmath18 used in the fits .",
    "thus the generally uncertain dust absorption is effectively corrected for by this procedure .",
    "for the 29 caln - tololo sne , we use values of red - shift , @xmath10 , @xmath37 , and @xmath2 given in table 1 of hamuy et al.(1996 ) .",
    "table 2 presents the results of our joint fitting of the cepheid - calibrated ( cc ) sne + caln - tololo ( ct ) sne for two data selections . shown",
    "are the number of fitted supernovae in each category , the best - fit values of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath25 , and @xmath18 , and the individual confidence levels for the best joint fit of the two subsets of data . in the first row we limit the sample to the six directly calibrated cc sne that also satisfy the color selection @xmath38 ( vaughan et al . , 1998 ) and to the 26 color - selected ct sne .",
    "in the second row , the full nearby sample of 10 cc sne are jointly fitted with all 29 of the ct sne . both yield , fortuitously , identical values for @xmath39 .",
    "it can be seen from table 2 that the ct data alone fit extremely well in both cases even though the @xmath25 and @xmath18 parameters are optimized to fit the combined ( ct and cc ) data .",
    "the confidence levels for the ct data are in all cases considerably higher than the most likely value of 0.5 .",
    "this reflects the presumed overestimate of the errors in the ct data set described in tripp ( 1998 ) where these data alone lead for the 29 ( 26 ) sne to an unrealistically high confidence level of 0.98 ( 0.97 ) for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in both cases the joint confidence levels are acceptable due in large measure to these overly good fit of the ct data .",
    "for the case of six cc sne , good fits are also realized for the cc subsample .",
    "but this is not the case for the 10 cc sne where their confidence level falls below 1% .",
    "this is due to a conflict between the two most recent cc sne : 1991 t and 1998bu .",
    "they are both somewhat reddened slow decliners , with the first being superluminous and the second being subluminous according to this analysis , so that no @xmath25 and @xmath18 corrections can adequately reconcile the two and at the same time fit the ct data . and @xmath42 . alternatively",
    ", if one or the other of the two conflicting sne is eliminated , then ( cc+ct ) fits can be found that are also good cc fits .",
    "thus , making the color cut , thereby discarding 98bu and retaining 91 t , yields @xmath43 with a cc confidence level of 0.36 , while selecting just the directly calibrated sne and making no color cut discards 91 t and retains 98bu , yielding @xmath44 with a cc confidence level of 0.30 .",
    "it is to be expected from the extreme nature of these two sne , lying , as they do , far out on either side of the @xmath33 distribution , that when one or the other is eliminated it will substantially impact @xmath0 .",
    "it has been suggested ( fisher et al .",
    "1999 ) that sn 1991 t forms a separate class of relatively rare superluminous objects not seen among the ct sample .",
    "it is best explained as the result of a merger of two white dwarfs leading to a super - chandrasekhar explosion .",
    "sn 1998bu is a normal supernova , but with considerable dust obscuration .",
    "making the conventional color cut @xmath45 eliminates it .",
    "since there is no evidence coming from interstellar absorption lines for strong dust obscuration among the 29 ct sne , whereas all three of the 10 cc sne falling outside this cut show clear evidence for this , in order to minimize bias between the samples the safest procedure is to apply the color cut to both groups as we do in the cc6/ct26 fit . ]",
    "we list in table 3 the values of @xmath46 for each of the cepheid - calibrated sne along with their residuals , i.e. , @xmath47 \\slash \\delta m_b^0 $ ] , for both fits of table 2 . in figure 1 , we show the corrected values ( filled circles ) and the uncorrected values @xmath11 ( open circles ) for the full sample ( cc10/ct29 ) .",
    "these are displayed as a function of @xmath2 in figure 1a and as a function of b - v in figure 1b .",
    "the strong dependences of the uncorrected open circles on @xmath2 and @xmath1 are mostly removed by the best - fit parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as seen in the corrected full circles .",
    "however , as noted above , this fit to a common value of @xmath50 has an unsatisfactory @xmath33 with cl = 0.009 due to the conflicting demands of sn 1991 t and sn 1998bu .",
    "> from the confidence levels in table 2 , it is evident that the combined > data from the caln - tololo and the cepheid - calibrated supernovae can be simultaneously fit in a satisfactory manner . however , the good confidence level , primarily the result of exceedingly good fits of the ct sne by themselves , disguises a significant difference in the data sets .",
    "this is apparent in figure 2 , which shows plots of @xmath37 vs. @xmath14 for the 29 ct sne ( figure 2a ) and the 10 cc sne ( filled circles in figure 2b ) .",
    "the striking difference between the two groups is the complete absence of unreddened @xmath51 events beyond @xmath52 among the 10 cc sne and their abundance among the 29 ct sne .",
    "since @xmath37 and @xmath2 are both independent of distance , we may include in figure 2b six additional nearby sne in the virgo and fornax clusters ( open circles ) whose distances are still uncertain .",
    "this inclusion makes the two samples more compatible , suggesting that the void in the nearby sample of 10 may be , in part , due to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "thus , while the 29 ct sne in figure 2a display very little correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath2 , within the limited statistics of the 10 cc sne there is a strong correlation , but one which is much reduced by the inclusion of the six distance - uncalibrated sne .",
    "a possible bias affecting any measurement of the hubble constant , both in our two parameter fit and previous one and zero parameter fits , may arise because the nearby and distant samples come from galaxies of somewhat different morphologies .",
    "since a galaxy must contain a population of young stars in order to produce cepheid variables , the cc sne are generally found in spiral galaxies .",
    "( an exception to this is ngc5253 , the parent of sne 1972e and 1895b , which is often classified as an e / so peculiar galaxy .",
    "a putative explanation for its star forming regions is that they are the result of a galactic merger . ) .",
    "thus , apart from sn 1972e , our cc sample comes from spiral galaxies , whereas the ct sample is about equally divided between spirals and e , e / so , and so galaxies . eliminating from ct26 all but",
    "the 13 spirals gives for cc6/ct13 , after reminimizing @xmath33 for this smaller sample , a value of @xmath54 for @xmath0 compared to @xmath55 for the full sample ct6/ct26 .",
    "since the former is presumably freer of potential bias we take @xmath4 as our best estimate of the hubble constant and the associated value of -19.46 for @xmath56 .",
    "we now discuss the uncertainty in @xmath0 arising from a variety of sources . the 1-@xmath57 statistical error in @xmath6 is found to be @xmath58 . in addition , there is uncertainty in @xmath25 and @xmath18 which we display in figure 3 where @xmath0 , as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath18 , is superposed on the 1- , 2- , 3- , and 4-@xmath57 contours of the cc6/ct26 fit .",
    "> from this we obtain the 1-@xmath57 error from the @xmath25 and @xmath18 uncertainty > of @xmath59 . throughout this analysis",
    "we have fixed the insensitive deceleration parameter at @xmath60 , found by making a three parameter @xmath61 fit of the 26 ct sne jointly with the 9 cosmological sne of riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for which @xmath1 colors were available .",
    "if we assign an uncertainty of @xmath62 to this value of @xmath12 , this leads to an uncertainty @xmath63 . combining these three sources in quadrature yields @xmath64 .    to these uncertainties arising from the sne ia analysis",
    "must be added a larger uncertainty coming from the calibration of the cepheid variables and their possible metallicity dependence .",
    "the madore and freedman ( 1991 ) distance scale in current use fixes the distance modulus to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to be 18.50 mag ( 50.1 kpc ) and scales more distant cepheid - based galaxy distances to this value . because of the importance of this number for the determination of the hubble constant , much attention has been devoted to methods for obtaining a more accurate value .",
    "a recent review from a post - hipparcos perspective ( walker 1998 ) recommends a mean modulus of @xmath65 , found using a variety of distance indicators . however , even more recent analyses of an eclipsing binary in the lmc ( guinan et al .",
    "1998 ) , found during the ogle microlensing search , yield a value as low as @xmath66 mag ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) . for this and other reasons evident in the walker(1998 ) summary",
    ", we use without change the distance moduli of cepheid - calibrated sne ia found by the various observers which are all based on the 18.50 mag lmc value .",
    "we assign to this value a 1-@xmath57 error of @xmath67 mag , with the usual statistical view that a true distance modulus to the lmc differing by twice that value would be surprising and one differing by 3-@xmath57 would be very unlikely . using @xmath68 obtained from equation ( 1 )",
    ", this uncertainty leads to a 1-@xmath57 error of @xmath69 .",
    "for some years there has been concern that metallicity differences between the lmc and the cepheid- calibrated galaxies can alter the derived distances to these galaxies . as the most easily measured proxy for metallicity , kochanek ( 1997 )",
    "has collected the logarithmic abundance ratio @xmath70 $ ] for a number of the cepheid - calibrated galaxies relative to that of the lmc . for galaxies hosting sne ia ,",
    "these cover a range of @xmath70 $ ] from -0.35 to + 0.69 .",
    "we have used these to alter the measured distance moduli @xmath34 by means of the expression @xmath71 $ ] , where the parameter @xmath72 is varied to obtain a best fit . for cc6/ct26 , the data set for which five of the cepheid - calibrated galaxies have measured values of @xmath70 $ ] , we find @xmath73 , in agreement with other recent findings which fall between 0.14 and 0.31 ( kochanek ( 1997 ) , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , nevalainen and roos ( 1998 ) ) , but showing that this data set has little sensitivity to @xmath72 . if we fix @xmath74 and follow the previous procedure of varying @xmath25 and @xmath18 to find a @xmath33 minimum , then @xmath0 increases by 0.8 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 . since the question of a metallicity dependence is still in dispute ( see beaulieu et al .",
    "1997 , saha et al .",
    "1997 , and saio and gautschy 1998 for recent differing views ) , we retain the value of @xmath0 without correction but assign an uncertainty in @xmath72 of @xmath75 resulting in @xmath76 due to this source . combining all these errors in quadrature yields @xmath77 for the overall uncertainty .    despite significant differences with other analyses",
    ", our value of @xmath78 falls squarely in the middle of the range spanned by recent determinations using sne ia .",
    "these values of @xmath0 , all using the distance modulus of 18.50 to the lmc , range between 55 and 69 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "one difference between our analysis and others is that they all seem to use the nearby approximation to equation ( 1 ) , which is tantamount to setting @xmath79 . if instead they were to use equation ( 1 ) with a negative @xmath12 , as is now apparently required by the cosmological data , then their values would each increase by about 1.7 units in cases when the ct sne are used for the hubble flow sample .",
    "the other major difference is that only our analysis uses two independent parameters ( @xmath25 and @xmath18 ) to standardize the luminosity of the supernovae ; this is required in order to obtain a fit to the ct data with an acceptable @xmath33 ( tripp 1998 ) . among the recent analyses using a collection of nearby calibrating supernovae , saha et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , employing seven cepheid - calibrated sne ( 1895b , 1937c , 1960f , 1972e , 1981b , 1989b , 1990n ) and no standardizing parameters , find @xmath80 .",

    "the difference in @xmath0 found in these two analyses lies primarily in the introduction of the @xmath25 parameter .",
    "our analysis , involving both @xmath25 and @xmath18 , reduces @xmath25 and leads to an intermediate result .",
    "this is immediately apparent from figure 3 .",
    "as can be discerned from the figure , the saha et al.(1997 ) @xmath82 fit should yield about 60 for @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to their 58 after correcting for the above effect of @xmath12 .",
    "likewise the suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) fit with only @xmath25 as a free parameter should , after the @xmath12 correction , yield about 66 , as can be seen from the figure for @xmath83 .",
    "apparently , different selections of cepheid - calibrated sne have only a minor effect on @xmath0 .",
    "thus future augmentations to the present small number of cepheid - calibrated sne will probably have little impact on @xmath0 .",
