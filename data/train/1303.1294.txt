    "interferometry plays a central role in physics , with applications ranging from sensitive phase measurements , e.g.  to monitor the spatial displacements experienced by gravitational wave detectors @xcite , to fundamental tests of quantum physics , such as the wave - particle duality of increasingly complex quantum objects @xcite .",
    "given the power of interference experiments , it is natural to ask how their scope can be extended to access entanglement ",
    "the second pillar of nonclassicality @xcite , and an important resource in quantum information @xcite .",
    "such a combined witnessing of spatial interference and entanglement would not only amount to a striking demonstration of the departure of non - local quantum behavior from classical physics .",
    "it might also be used for entanglement - enhanced metrological applications such as phase estimation schemes or quantum lithography @xcite .",
    "so far all experiments that combined entanglement with spatial interference were based on photons @xcite .",
    "this is due to their great practical use in information science , and above all to the existence of a mature technology for producing and manipulating photonic systems .",
    "however , the recent advances in the control of ultracold atoms suggest that it will be possible to carry out similar experiments with material particles .",
    "in particular , tailored einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entangled atom pairs can be produced by dissociating feshbach molecules @xcite or by colliding bose - einstein condensates @xcite , in a process similar to parametric down conversion of laser light , the established method to generate entanglement among photons @xcite .",
    "it would be a great experimental advancement to demonstrate a nonlocal spatial interference effect with particles of matter .",
    "this would establish the presence of both entanglement and the wave - particle duality in a single experiment on tangible material objects , allowing one to transfer potential application schemes such as quantum lithography @xcite from photons to the realm of quantum matter .",
    "moreover , interpretational issues such as the nonlocality of bohmian trajectories could be addressed @xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether the observation of an interference pattern in the coincidence signal of two detectors already proves the existence of entanglement .",
    "this is the more so , as any experiment will be characterized by a non - ideal epr source and other imperfections leading to a reduced fringe visibility of the interference signal .",
    "generic setup of a nonlocal young experiment with epr entangled particle pairs .",
    "a source provides epr entangled particle pairs of equal mass , which are then separately passed through a grating or double slit ( with slit separation @xmath0 and slit width @xmath1 ) .",
    "while the position measurements yield an unstructured pattern on each screen , interference fringes are expected if one evaluates the correlated outcomes @xmath2 .",
    "taking the epr correlation to be in the transversal @xmath3-direction it is sufficient to describe the longitudinal @xmath4-motion , which separates the particles , by classical counterpropagating trajectories . ]    in this article we provide an entanglement criterion for nonlocal spatial interference based on epr entangled particle pairs , and we work out the conditions for the successful detection of a nonlocal interference signal . a schematic generalizing the single - particle young experiment is depicted in fig .  [ schematicsetup ] .",
    "a source creates a pair of epr entangled particles which travel freely into opposite directions until each one passes through a grating or double slit . after a further free evolution",
    "their positions are recorded by spatially resolving detectors located at opposite sides of the experiment . even for a source emitting ideal epr particle pairs",
    "no interference will be observed at each of the detectors . however , a ` nonlocal ' interference pattern is expected to emerge if one analyzes the combined detection records at both sides by focusing on the center of mass of the coincident pairs .",
    "a major challenge in such nonlocal interference experiments lies in verifying the presence of continuous variable entanglement .",
    "once the gratings are passed the two - particle state of motion is strongly non - gaussian , with a broadened and structured momentum distribution .",
    "the standard entanglement criteria @xcite can then not be used , even though they apply to arbitrary states , since they will detect entanglement only if the corresponding position and momentum variances are sufficiently squeezed . moreover , only position measurements are easily doable with material particles , practically ruling out tomographic techniques of entanglement verification .",
    "recently , we described a viable method based on _ modular variables _ , which captures situations where entanglement gives rise to spatial interference @xcite . in the following we introduce the corresponding criterion , adapted to the specific correlations displayed by the epr interference experiments .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : nli ] we describe how the nonlocal interference pattern can be calculated for finite epr sources ( i.e.  sources that produce epr states with finite variances in all coordinates and momenta ) , allowing us to discuss the requirements and conditions for observing nonlocal interference .",
    "after briefly explaining the concept of modular variables , the entanglement criterion is then formulated in sect .",
    "[ sec : iev ] , along with a discussion of its robustness . in sect .",
    "[ sec : emwi ] we discuss different experimental scenarios , before presenting our conclusions in sect .  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen considered originally the idealized state @xcite @xmath5 switching to center - of - mass coordinates , and disregarding normalization , it may be written as @xmath6 the state supports perfect correlations both in the relative position @xmath7 and in the center - of - mass momentum @xmath8 .",
    "the expectation values of these commuting observables vanish for the idealized epr state , as do their variances @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the conjugate relative momentum @xmath11 and the center - of - mass position @xmath12 remain undetermined .",
    "the idealized epr state is readily generalized to a normalized squeezed gaussian wavefunction exhibiting finite position and momentum variances , @xmath13 the resulting correlations are sketched in figure [ epr_state ] for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 much smaller than the uncertainties of an ( unsqueezed ) minimum uncertainty state .",
    "correlations expressed by the squeezed gaussian ( [ realisticeprstate ] ) representing a normalizable epr state .",
    "the sketches display two - dimensional projections of the four - dimensional wigner function , emphasizing characteristic properties of the epr state .",
    "( a ) the conjugate relationship between the squeezed center - of - mass momentum @xmath16 and the correspondingly broad center - of - mass coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "( b ) the conjugate relation between the relative coordinate and its momentum .",

    "we proceed to determine the joint probability distribution for recording the two epr particles on detection screens after each passed a grating with @xmath19 slits . to this end",
    "it is helpful to divide the evolution into three steps : ( i ) the free time evolution from the source to the gratings , ( ii ) the instantaneous effect of passing through the gratings , and ( iii ) a further period of free time evolution from the gratings to the screens .",
    "this can be done since all the correlations probed in such a setting reside in the transversal motion of the two particles . in the fraunhofer approximation the longitudinal motion from the source to the screens may be viewed as taking place with definite velocities which are to be averaged in the end . the longitudinal position can thus be considered as a parametrization of time .",
    "we take the longitudinal direction to be the @xmath4-axis and the grating bars to be aligned along the @xmath20-axis such that the relevant motion takes place in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the free time evolution of the gaussian wavefunction ( [ realisticeprstate ] ) from the source to the gratings can be determined analytically . denoting the arrival time of the particles at the gratings as @xmath21 , the evolved state immediately before passing the gratings reads as @xmath22 here we transformed from the center - of - mass momentum @xmath23 to the center - of - mass position @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the corresponding ( large ) uncertainty .",
    "the evolution introduces additional phase factors and results in a dispersion - induced broadening of the original gaussian wave packets described by the complex dispersion factors @xmath26 associated with total mass @xmath27 and reduced mass @xmath28 , respectively . the normalization factor @xmath29 and the global phase @xmath30 , which are readily calculated ,",
    "will not be required in the following .",
    "the effect of traversing the gratings can be captured by the grating operators @xmath31 which are projectors acting on the individual particles , @xmath32 .",
    "the gratings are taken to consist of @xmath19 slits , with slit distance @xmath0 and slit width @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ schematicsetup ] .",
    "the slit indices are taken from @xmath33 which guarantees that the gratings are arranged symmetrically with respect to the @xmath4-axis for all @xmath19 .",
    "the gratings are assumed to be ideal in the sense that imperfections and the dispersion force between particle and grating can be neglected .",
    "this is permissible because such slit imperfections would not affect the fringe structure of the nonlocal interference pattern , but only its envelope .",
    "immediately after traversing the gratings the state follows from the projection @xmath34 .",

    "if we measure which slit a particle took on one side , by detecting it right after the grating , we must be able to infer which slit the other particle took on the other side .",
    "this is guaranteed by requiring that @xmath38 because the second gaussian in eq .",
    "( [ stateaftergrids ] ) can then be well approximated by a kronecker delta for the slit indices @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( along with with a factor describing irrelevant intra - slit correlations ) .",
    "the slit correlation condition ( [ slitcorrelationcondition ] ) combines two requirements . on the one hand",
    ", the initial state must be sufficiently squeezed in the relative position , @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , to guarantee ( [ slitcorrelationcondition ] ) at the relevant time @xmath21 when the gratings are passed , the dispersive broadening of the wave packet evolving from the source to the screen must remain sufficiently bounded .",
    "the propagation time @xmath21 from the source to the gratings thus can not exceed @xmath42 this shows that there is a tradeoff between the squeezing of the relative position @xmath14 and the maximum admissible propagation time from the source to the screen .",
    "this is no problem of principle since the longitudinal motion might be uncoupled from the transverse dynamics , allowing one to propagate the particles with arbitrary velocity to their gratings . in practice , one may well be forced to start out with an isotropic two - particle state , using apertures for defining the longitudinal direction . in this case",
    "the dispersion tradeoff ( [ propagationtime ] ) can be a quite severe restriction .",
    "as a second condition one must require that the @xmath19 slits are illuminated uniformly by the incoming wavefunction .",
    "this is ensured by the first gaussian in eq .",
    "( [ stateaftergrids ] ) provided @xmath43 since the slit correlation condition ( [ slitcorrelationcondition ] ) already requires that the relative dispersion remains modest , @xmath44 , we can estimate @xmath45 because @xmath46 . the initial state ( [ realisticeprstate ] ) must therefore exhibit a large center - of - mass uncertainty @xmath47 .      applying the conditions ( [ slitcorrelationcondition ] ) and ( [ equalilluminationcondition ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ stateaftergrids ] ) yields a greatly simplified expression for the slit - entangled two - particle state present once both gratings have been passed , @xmath48 specifically , condition ( [ slitcorrelationcondition ] ) implies that those contributions to the wave function where the two particles do not pass opposite slits with @xmath49 can be neglected .",
    "for instance , the next neighbor contributions with @xmath50 are weighted by the factor @xmath51 $ ] , and already a moderate ratio of @xmath52 suppresses these by three orders of magnitude compared to the opposite - slit contributions .",
    "condition ( [ equalilluminationcondition ] ) , on the other hand , effects that all opposite slit pairs contribute equally to the resulting superposition .",
    "since the contributions at the margins of the gratings are diminished by the factor @xmath53 $ ] , already a ratio of @xmath54 limits the amplitude decrease toward the margins to 7% .",
    "the state ( [ stateaftergridsapproximated ] ) describes a superposition of the particle pair passing through opposite slits .",
    "this becomes most transparent once we rewrite the state in position representation , @xmath55 here the normalized wavefunction @xmath56 describes that both particles are confined to a single pair of opposite slits , @xmath57 with @xmath58 . as before , the phase @xmath59 and the normalization factor @xmath60 will not be required in the following .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ modularmomentumentangledstate ] ) is an instance of a _ modular momentum entangled _ ( mme ) state , a class of states discussed in a more general context in @xcite . as for any mme state ,",
    "the momentum representation of ( [ modularmomentumentangledstate ] ) reads @xmath61 this in turn implies a nonlocal interference behavior if the particle momenta are measured .",
    "the joint momentum probability distribution takes the form @xmath62 it reduces to a sinusoidal fringe pattern in the case of double slits , while @xmath63 develops sharpened main maxima and suppressed side maxima for @xmath64 .",

    "@xcite sets out to produce epr entangled atom pairs of metastable helium atoms .",

    "the helium atoms are kicked against each other by stimulated raman transitions and collide by @xmath203-wave scattering .",

    "after correlating the data of both particles the resulting nonlocal interference pattern ( [ farfield ] ) will have a finite contrast which limits how well - defined the phase of the pattern is .",
    "this phase uncertainty is quantified by the variance of the modular part of the total momentum @xmath88 , the second ingredient to the entanglement criterion .",

    "position measurements in the overlap regions can be implemented by resonant photon scattering .",
    "the joint probability for the particle position then exhibits a nonlocal interference pattern .",
    "this completes the analogy with the young double slit experiment . to prove entanglement one needs again a complementary measurement",
    "; in this case one must detect the positions of the atom pair at a time when the wave packets do not yet overlap to ensure that the particle pair is correlated in the early or late dissociation time .      in a recent article @xcite an experiment",

    "all scattered and non - scattered photons one gains knowledge about the relative coordinate of the two particles , but not about the center of mass , such that an mme state ( [ modularmomentumentangledstate ] ) with @xmath132 is eventually prepared after about 150 photon detections .",
    "if the two particles are then released from the trap , such that they evolve freely and drop towards a detection screen , one expects a nonlocal spatial interference pattern similar to ( [ finalstatespatialprobabilitydistribution ] ) .",
    "an appropriate modular entanglement criterion can then serve to deduce the underlying entanglement from the measured correlations , if one complements the detection by correlation measurements taken briefly after releasing the particles from the trap . however , unlike in the previous proposal , both particles are detected on the same screen , and therefore no macroscopic spatial separation is achieved between the two particles .",
    "we discussed a generic scheme to generalize the young interference experiment for the case of two entangled particles , where nonlocal spatial interference is achieved by subjecting each particle to a grating structure .",
    "the corresponding quantum state exhibits strongly non - gaussian continuous variable entanglement , which can be revealed by a variance - based entanglement criterion .",
    "the latter is formulated in terms of modular variables , i.e.  coordinates adapted to spatial interference phenomena .",
    "experimentally , the entanglement detection is based on simple position measurements directly behind the gratings or in the far field ; the modular variances are then calculated in a post - measurement analysis .",
    "we find that the entanglement detection scheme is quite robust against noisy epr sources , coping even with substantial admixtures of classical correlations and incoherences .",
    "moreover , while already double slit arrangements allow one to verify entanglement , one can improve the correlations by increasing the number of slits .",
    "we showed that a nonlocal young test could be performed in a wide range of physical systems .",
