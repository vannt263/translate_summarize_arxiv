    "the relaxations were considered complete when the maximum force on any atom was less than 0.002 ev /  .",
    "these forces used dft kinetic energies and charge densities computed from wave functions at the @xmath129 point of the supercell brillouin zone . as a test of the influence of periodic replicas , we recomputed , for one of the @xmath2 configurations , the interatomic forces with dft charge densities @xmath130 computed with a @xmath131 monkhorst - pack mesh@xcite .",
    "in other words , the wavefunctions used for @xmath130 were weighted averages over fully periodic states @xmath132 , and fully anti - periodic states @xmath133 ( a corner of the supercell brillouin zone ) , and various intermediate periodicities like @xmath134 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 and @xmath137 equal to @xmath138 or @xmath139 .",
    "the change of wave - function boundary conditions causes a change of interatomic force , which is a measure of the influence of artificial periodicity .",
    "the maximum force increased to 0.02ev /  , with a mean force of 0.005 ev /  .",
    "this indicates that the atomic displacements are hardly affected by artificial periodic images .    in summary ,",
    "we analyze the strong short - range order in the ( gan)@xmath0(zno)@xmath140 semiconductor alloy using mc simulation .",
    "the temperature and composition dependence of short - range order and configurational entropy are studied .",
    "short - range order parameters are shown to decay slowly with increasing temperature . given the short - range order parameters , the statistics of pair distribution is approximated by a binomial distribution .",
    "the configurational entropy is approximated in terms of short - range order parameters .",
    "the dependence of bond - length on local chemical environment is shown to be significant .",
    "for any nearest - neighbor cation - anion bond , the bond length reduces with increasing presence of neighbouring zn and o atoms . based on the statistics of bond - length for @xmath21=0.5 at @xmath20k",
    ", we fit an empirical model which can be used as a starting guess in dft structural relaxations to reduce the computational effort .",
    "@xcite gives a derivation of the approximate sro - corrected configurational entropy .",

    "1 ) of the sro parameter , the probability of finding pairs in the @xmath8 neighbor shell , of a simple binary a@xmath140b@xmath0 alloy is @xmath141 where @xmath47 . we see that @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . for an alloy with @xmath145 atoms ,",
    "the number of pairs of the @xmath8 shell is @xmath146 , with @xmath49 the coordination number of the @xmath42th shell .",
    "the average number of each type is @xmath147 and similarly for @xmath148 , _ etc . _",
    "the number of ways of arranging this many pairs is in first approximation @xmath149 however , @xmath150 contains unphysical arrangements , where one site is occupied by both @xmath56 and @xmath151 atoms .",
    "therefore , the exact enumeration @xmath152 is always smaller than @xmath150 .",
    "we assume a universal function @xmath153 defined by @xmath154 . we choose to fix this `` universal function '' by the relation @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the value of @xmath157 which maximizes @xmath152 .",
    "further , we approximate the maximum by an upper limit , its summation , @xmath158 the summation on right - hand side is just the total number of possible alloy configurations , @xmath159 . similarly , we approximate the numerator @xmath160 of @xmath161 by an upper limit , its enumeration in the completely random alloy , namely @xmath162 where @xmath163 , etc . therefore the universal function @xmath161 is approximated by @xmath164 the entropy then can be approximated in the thermodynamic limit using stirling s approximation @xmath165\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are grateful for discussions with members of the swassit group including neerav kharche , james t. muckerman and mark s. hybertsen .",
