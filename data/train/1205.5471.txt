    "this paper presents a theoretical description of diffusion growth of a gas bubble in liquid solution as a result of a considerable pressure drop ( in the order of @xmath0 times ) .",
    "these conditions of bubble growth process are observed in magmatic melts during volcanic eruptions [ [ sparks-1978 ] , [ sahagian-1999 ] ] .",
    "after such a significant pressure drop the solution becomes strongly supersaturated ; and homogeneous ( fluctuational ) nucleation of gas bubbles becomes possible .",
    "it is the growth dynamics of such bubbles that is the subject of the present paper .",
    "it has to be noted that the growth regularities of a solitary bubble are crucial for the description of the whole kinetics of phase transition in supersaturated solution [ [ chernov-2004 ] , [ slezov-2004 ] , [ slezov-2005 ] ] .",
    "while describing gas bubble growth in supersaturated solution two rough approximations are traditionally made [ [ chernov-2004 ] , [ navon ] , [ lensky ] , [ slezov-2004 ] , [ slezov-2005 ] ] :    1 .",
    "the flux of the dissolved gas towards the bubble is assumed to be steady .",
    "the consideration is limited to bubbles with the radius that is large enough to neglect the laplace pressure in comparison with the external pressure of the solution .    in the present paper ,",
    "following our preceding works [ [ kuchma - gor - kuni ] , [ gor - kuchma - sievert ] ] , while exploiting the steady approximation , we take into account the laplace pressure in the bubble considering the bubble from the very moment of its nucleation .",
    "consideration of the time - dependent laplace pressure in the bubble makes both gas density in the bubble and the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved gas at the surface of the bubble time - dependent as well .",
    "gas bubble growth in a solution taking into account the laplace pressure was considered as early as in 1950 in the classical paper by epstein and plesset [ [ epstein - plesset ] ] , where the authors obtained the equation for the bubble radius as a function of time . in order to relate the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved gas and the solution pressure , [ [ epstein - plesset ] ]",
    "presupposed the fulfillment of henry s law : i. e. the proportional dependence between these two values .",
    "indeed , henry s law is fulfilled for the solution of @xmath1 in magmatic melt [ [ lensky ] ] ; however , it is not valid for the solution of @xmath2 vapor [ [ chernov-2004 ] , [ navon ] ] . in this case , which is crucial for practical reasons , sievert s law is observed : the equilibrium concentration of the dissolved gas is proportional to the square root of the solution pressure [ [ stolper ] ] .",
    "sometimes both cases are referred to as `` henry s law '' , but in the present paper , in order to avoid confusion , we will use the term `` sievert s law '' for the case with a square root , following e. g. [ [ cable - frade ] ] . here",
    "we analyze the bubble growth dynamics in both cases : for henry s and sievert s laws . for sievert s law",
    "we obtain the equation for the bubble radius as a function of time analogous to [ [ epstein - plesset ] ] , which has not been obtained previously .",
    "our analysis shows that , irrespective of the law applied to gas solubility , three characteristic stages can be marked out in the growth dynamics . during the first stage",
    "the bubble radius is growing with an increasing rate . on the second stage the growth rate decreases .",
    "the third stage , when the growth rate continues to decrease , begins when the laplace pressure inside the bubble becomes comparable with the external pressure of the solution .",
    "we demonstrate that during the first two stages the time dependence of the bubble radius is different for the cases when either henry s and sievert s laws are fulfilled , while during the third stage this distinction is no longer observed .    for both henry s and sievert s laws we obtain intervals within which the bubble radius changes on each stage , as well as time limits and conditions when the steady approximation is applicable .",
    "we show that , as the radius of the bubble increases , the steady condition becomes stricter ; and , consequently , as a rule , the steady regime of a multistage bubble growth gradually gives way to the nonsteady one .",
    "we obtain analytical expression for the time when laplace pressure influences on bubble growth vanishes and therefore substantiate the estimation of this time made in [ [ grinin - kuni - gor ] ] .",
    "after this time passed the bubble growth reaches a self - similar regime [ [ scriven-1959 ] ] .",
    "we also analyze whether the steady approximation is applicable to the case of gas bubbles in magma described by navon [ [ navon ] ] and chernov et al .",
    "[ [ chernov-2004 ] ] for large radius of a bubble ( neglecting laplace pressure ) .",
    "besides that , we present the analytical description of bubble dissolution in the pure solvent for the sievert s solubility law , which was not presented before in literature .",
    "let us consider a gas dissolved in a liquid .",
    "the solution was initially in an equilibrium state at temperature @xmath3 and pressure @xmath4 .",
    "the concentration of the dissolved gas in the solution under such conditions will be denoted as @xmath5 .",
    "then we instantly relieve the external pressure to value @xmath6 in such way that solution becomes supersaturated .",
    "the temperature and volume of the solution remain the same , thus value @xmath5 still serves for the dissolved gas concentration .",
    "it is more convenient to express the state of the solution in terms of dimensionless variables : supersaturation @xmath7 and gas solubility @xmath8 defined here via @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the equilibrium concentration of dissolved gas at the external pressure @xmath6 , @xmath12 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "when some time passes after the pressure drop , a gas bubble nucleates and begins growing regularly . following [ [ chernov-2004 ] ] we assume that the bubble is in mechanical equilibrium with the solution , and its dynamics is governed only by diffusion process . this assumption will be discussed in appendix a. the radius of the bubble will be denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the situation when the solvent is in its stable liquid state ; therefore , we assume that the bubble consists of gas only , but not of the solvent vapor . the gas in the bubble is considered to be ideal .    when the bubble is studied after some time @xmath14 since its nucleation , its radius complies with the strong inequality @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the surface tension of the pure solvent ( it is true while the solution is considered as diluted ) .",
    "( [ r>>laplace ] ) allows us to neglect the influence of laplace pressure on the bubble growth .",
    "therefore , we can write the following equations for the pressure in the bubble @xmath17 and for the equilibrium solution concentration near the surface of the bubble @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20 the subscripts @xmath21 denotes that the equilibrium concentration @xmath22 is related with the equilibrium near the flat surface of phase separation ( @xmath23 ) . from eq .",

    "( [ r>>laplace ] ) becomes valid , laplace pressure influences bubble growth .",
    "thus both quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 become radius - dependent ( and , therefore , time - dependent ) . for @xmath17",
    "now we have @xmath26    in order to write the equation for @xmath18 we need to know the solubility law . for the simplest case of henry s law",
    "the equilibrium concentration of dissolved gas is proportional to the corresponding pressure @xmath27 however , henry s law is fulfilled only in such systems where there is no molecules dissociation during gas dissolution . in another important case when the gas molecules completely dissociate in the solvent into two parts",
    "the henry s law is replaced with so - called sievert s law ( see e.  g. [ [ darken - gurry ] ] ) , and , therefore , eq .",
    "( [ chem - eq - henry ] ) is replaced with the following one : @xmath28 sievert s law is fulfilled for water vapor dissolved in a silicate melt [ [ stolper ] ] .",

    "( [ chem - eq ] ) means that the boundary condition for the gas diffusion problem will be different for henry s and sievert s laws .",
    "the change of boundary condition , as we will see further , leads to the change of bubble dynamics .",
    "after the nucleation of the bubble , when its growth can be considered regular ( i.e. the bubble can not be dissolved by fluctuations ) , its growth is governed by the diffusion flux of gas molecules into it . in this paper",
    "we will study the case when the diffusion flux can be assumed as steady .",
    "the conditions when such approximation is valid will be discussed further .",
    "taking into account the equality of gas concentration at the bubble surface to the equilibrium concentration @xmath18 and the equality of gas concentration far from the bubble to the initial concentration @xmath5 , we can write a simple expression for the steady diffusion flux density @xmath29 @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the diffusion coefficient of gas molecules in the pure solvent ( we assume that the solution is diluted ) .",

    "co - factor @xmath80 , increasing with @xmath13 , corresponds to the fast ( the scale of change of @xmath13 is @xmath49 ) increase of the driving force of the process ( the value @xmath81 ) with the growth of @xmath13 .",

    "finally , co - factor @xmath83 , which increases with the growth of @xmath13 , takes into account the counteraction of laplace pressure to the bubble growth , i.  e. the fact that the bubble growth is facilitated by the reduction of laplace pressure with the growth of @xmath13 , while other factors are equal ( the scale of its change is @xmath41 ) .",
