    "this allows us in principle to map out the positions of defects , as long as the shape of the fs is known . apart from the period of the oscillations , there is also information in the amplitude . since short periods",

    "this allows us to compare the calculation with the asymptotic approximation , and this shows that the approximation works very well for distances larger than @xmath387 .    in the case of the corrugated cylinder ( [ e_open1 ] ) the open necks cause cones with opening angle @xmath388 ( defined by the inflection line of the fs ) to be classically inaccessible .",

    "thus , by measuring the size of this dead region we directly obtain the position of the defect .",
    "the oscillation amplitude will be maximal at the border of the dead region , since the current density will be highest in the direction of the group velocity at the inflection line .",

    "again we find that the depth of the defect is determining the oscillation period , so that for given fs parameters this information can be exploited to investigate the structure of the metal below the surface .",
    "if the open direction is parallel with the surface the highest amplitude will be found with the stm tip straight above the defect . for @xmath393",

    "g_el_osc , since there are contributions from the belly as well as from the neck parts of the fs , plus a sum frequency . for small necks",
    "the signal will be dominated by the oscillation due to the belly .",
    "although the two models presented in this paper are still rather artificial , they provide insights that are quite valuable for experimental work in this field .",
    "the most prominent conclusion is that the regular oscillations due to convex parts of the fs , that behave as for the isotropic fs discussed previously @xcite , will often be dominated by signals due to special directions . on any surface that features regions of zero curvature",
    ", the strongest conductance fluctuations will come from electrons travelling with the group velocity of that region .",
    "not only does this hold for the inflection lines around the necks in the ( 111 ) direction of e.g. cu , ag or au , it is also true for the almost flat facets in the ( 110 ) direction of the same metals . in the case of an inflection line",
    "the signal will decay as @xmath394 , whereas for a flat facet the signal does not decay at all .",
