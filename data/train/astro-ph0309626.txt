    "first , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) discovered nearly - coherent oscillations during bursts , with frequencies in the range @xmath5@xmath6 @xcite . believed to be rotationally - modulated brightness asymmetries on the neutron star surface , the oscillation frequency tells us the neutron star spin , and potentially about the spreading of burning , and the surface magnetic field @xcite .",

    "i briefly review how the accreted hydrogen and helium burns , and the expected burst properties as a function of accretion rate .",
    "in particular , i concentrate on the differences between hydrogen and helium burning , which are crucial for understanding the regimes of burning , and for comparing to observations .    * the timescale for burning *  whereas helium burning proceeds rapidly via strong interactions , hydrogen burning is relatively slow , since beta decays are required to convert protons to neutrons .",
    "this leads to a saturation of the cno burning rate at high temperatures @xmath7 ( the so - called `` hot cno cycle '' ; @xcite ) , when proton captures in the cycle occur more rapidly than the subsequent beta - decays . at high accretion rates ,",
    "hot cno burning during accumulation of fuel depletes hydrogen prior to the runaway .",
    "the time to burn all the hydrogen in a given fluid element is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cno mass fraction .",
    "the amount of hydrogen vs.  helium present at ignition of the burst has a direct impact on the burst lightcurve .",
    "if the helium fraction is large , the rapid energy release at the beginning of the burst creates a luminosity exceeding the eddington luminosity , driving outwards expansion of the photosphere ( `` photospheric radius expansion '' ) @xcite .",
    "if hydrogen dominates the composition however , it burns after ignition via the rp - process @xcite . starting with seed nuclei made by helium burning ,",
    "this comprises a series of proton captures and beta - decays involving nuclei close to the proton drip line and extending well beyond the iron group .",
    "this can significantly delay the cooling of the burning layer , giving an extended burst tail , and burst durations @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "* thermal stability *  the nature of the instability is a thin shell flash @xcite , in which temperature perturbations drive runaway heating through temperature sensitive nuclear reactions .",

    "the hydrogen burns stably , and helium burning at a density @xmath14 drives the thermal instability .",
    "helium triggered bursts are of two types , depending on the time to accumulate the critical column of fuel ( or equivalently the recurrence time of the bursts @xmath15 ) .",
    "if @xmath16 , hydrogen burns away and ignition occurs in a pure helium layer below a steady burning hydrogen shell , giving a `` pure he '' burst ; if @xmath17 , hydrogen is present throughout the layer when the helium ignites , giving a `` mixed h / he '' burst .    for @xmath18 , helium burns at a temperature @xmath19 for which the temperature sensitivity of the triple alpha reaction is less than the temperature sensitivity of the cooling .",
    "the burning is then thermally stable , and the fuel burns at the rate it accretes .",
    "the accretion rate at which burning stabilizes and its dependence on metallicity is still not well - determined theoretically .",
    "* nuclear energy release *  hydrogen burning releases substantially more energy per gram , @xmath20 mev per nucleon compared to only @xmath21 mev per nucleon from helium burning .",

    "given the excellent agreement with theory , a natural question is whether we can use the bursts to constrain properties of the source @xcite . for mixed h",
    "/ he bursts , the ignition depth is mainly sensitive to the metallicity , because the temperature profile of the accumulating layer is set by hot cno burning .",
    "this suggests an argument to constrain the metallicity : if it was less than solar , the reduced cno heating would give a larger ignition column depth , and a larger recurrence time and burst energy than observed .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the relation between @xmath38 and the x - ray luminosity @xmath48 allows lower metallicity models to be accommodated by adopting a larger @xmath38 ( the larger column is then accreted in the observed recurrence time ) .",
    "additionally , the time - dependent simulations of woosley et al.@xcite show that at low metallicity , a new heat source takes over .",
    "production of cno elements in the tail of the previous x - ray burst leads to leftover hydrogen burning beneath the newly accreted layer ( `` compositional inertia '' ) , reducing the sensitivity to metallicity ( see also @xcite ) .    determining the metallicity requires an additional constraint on the models .",
    "galloway et al .",
    "@xcite recently concluded that the metallicity in the accreted layer was solar by looking at _ variations of burst properties with @xmath38_. they present data for 24 bursts observed by rxte between 1997 and 2002 .",
    "the @xmath0 value was found to decrease by @xmath1% as accretion rate increased by @xmath49% ( figure [ fig : gs1826alpha ] ) .",
    "this is exactly as expected from models with solar metallicity @xcite , since as accretion rate increases and recurrence time drops , less time is available to burn hydrogen between bursts .",
    "models with metallicity much less than solar are hard to reconcile with the @xmath0 variations .",
    "another constraint comes from the burst lightcurves , which show a long @xmath50 rise and a long @xmath51 tail increased with time .",

    "figure [ fig : kepler1 ] compares the average observed burst lightcurve with the recent simulations of woosley et al .",
    "these simulations are the first to incorporate a large nuclear reaction network that can follow the detailed rp process nucleosynthesis together with resolved vertical structure .",
    "the agreement between the observed lightcurve and solar metallicity model is remarkable , supporting the findings of galloway et al .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the simulations is in progress .",
    "the predicted burst lightcurves are sensitive to the nuclear physics input @xcite , and so there is potentially much to learn .",
    "the ignition column for mixed h / he bursts is predicted to be roughly independent of accretion rate , since hot cno burning sets the temperature in the accreted layer (  2 ) .",
    "galloway et al .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath52 , implying a slight decrease in the ignition column with @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "this remains to be understood ; a simple argument suggests a slight _ increase _ should be seen , since less helium is produced by hot cno burning for a shorter recurrence time , requiring a slightly thicker layer to ignite .",
    "two possible explanations for the discrepancy are ( i ) extra heating , e.g.  from thermal or compositional inertia effects @xcite , or ( ii ) the fraction of the star covered by fuel changes with @xmath38 . future comparisons with time - dependent simulations or improved spectral models",
    "should test these ideas .",
    "the ultracompact binary 4u  1820 - 30 ( orbital period 11.4 mins @xcite ) is an interesting source in which to study type i bursting behaviour .",
    "it has a known distance , being located in the metal - rich globular cluster ngc  6624 ( @xmath55fe@xmath56h@xmath57\\approx -0.4 $ ] , distance @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "it undergoes a characteristic 176 day accretion cycle @xcite during which the accretion rate varies by a factor of 3 or more .",
    "regular sequences of type i bursts are observed during the low state , with recurrence times of @xmath59@xmath60 hours @xcite . in the high state ,",
    "bursts become irregular or disappear altogether@xcite .",
    "this source also showed the most energetic and luminous superburst @xcite .     for 4u  1820 - 30 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "choosing @xmath61 allows both pure helium models ( dotted and short - dashed lines ) and models with hydrogen ( long - dashed line 10% hydrogen ; solid line 20% hydrogen ) to fit the observed values ( indicated by error bars and placed at the value of @xmath61 inferred from the x - ray luminosity ) . ]",
    "the extremely short orbital period implies a hydrogen - deficient companion , and observations of bursts support this picture , with @xmath62 @xcite as expected for helium rich material .",
    "different evolutionary models predict that the accreted matter is either pure helium @xcite , or contains a small amount of hydrogen ( perhaps 535% by mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , i looked at the question of whether the composition of the accreted material ( specifically the hydrogen fraction ) might be inferred from the burst properties @xcite .",
    "this is important to test intermediate - mass binary evolution models for x - ray binaries ( e.g.  @xcite ) which predict a small amount of hydrogen may be present .",
    "the inferred accretion rate when bursts are seen from 4u  1820 - 30 is @xmath63 , giving an ignition column depth @xmath64 .",
    "bildsten @xcite found that this compares well with time - dependent models of pure helium burning , although for a slightly hotter base temperature than expected .",
    "the reason for this can be seen by inspecting figure [ fig : regimes ] .",
    "ignition at @xmath65 requires heating equivalent to hot cno burning with @xmath66 .",
    "in the pure helium case , this heating must be provided by a heat flux into the layer from below , and translates to a flux equivalent to @xmath67 mev per accreted nucleon , higher than the expected crust luminosity @xcite .",
    "if hydrogen is present with mass fraction @xmath68 , hot cno burning during accumulation could provide the required heating @xcite ( this requires @xmath69 , likely satisfied for 4u  1820 - 30 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig:1820 ] , which shows the predicted recurrence times and burst energies for models with and without hydrogen , compared to observed values .",
    "models with hydrogen do much better for the accretion rate inferred from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , it is not possible to reach a firm conclusion because increasing the accretion rate by only a factor of two allows pure helium models to come into agreement .    as for gs  1826 - 24 , an additional constraint is required to determine the accreted composition .",
    "one possibility is to look for variations of the burst energetics with accretion rate . for",
    "10% accreted hydrogen , the time to burn all the hydrogen is @xmath70 hours , comparable to the recurrence time .",
    "this leads to @xmath71 variations in burst fluence as recurrence time varies .",
    "this is a promising way to constrain the accreted composition , but will require further observations of sequences of regular bursting with different recurrence times .",
    "another possible constraint comes from simultaneous modelling of type i bursts and superbursts , i discuss this further in  [ sec : interact ] .",
    "it would also be interesting to compare burst lightcurves with time - dependent simulations .",
    "the properties of regular burst sequences from both gs  1826 - 24 and 4u  1820 - 30 agree very well with theoretical expectations , and we have discussed to what extent we can learn about the accreted composition in these cases .",
    "however , it has been pointed out many times that the global bursting behavior is not understood , and for many bursters is _ opposite _ to that predicted by theory @xcite .",
    "exosat observations of several atoll sources showed that as x - ray luminosity increased , burst properties changed from regular , frequent bursts ( @xmath72 hours ) with long durations ( @xmath73 ) and low @xmath27 , to irregular , infrequent ( @xmath74 1 day ) , short ( @xmath75 ) bursts with high @xmath76 and often showing photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "rxte and bepposax observations have confirmed this result , with particularly good coverage for the transient source ks  1731 - 260 @xcite .",
    "cornelisse et al .",
    "@xcite found that observations of nine bursters were consistent with this pattern of bursting , with a universal transition luminosity @xmath77 ( although not all showed the transition from one burst type to another ) .",
    "the short bursts are naturally interpreted as pure he bursts ; the long bursts as mixed h / he bursts .",
    "the lightcurves of a long mixed h / he burst and long pure he burst will also look very different ; e.g.  the latter will most likely show a large photospheric radius expansion episode . ] .",
    "however , theory predicts a transition from pure he bursts to mixed h / he bursts as accretion rate increases rather than the other way around (  2 ) .",
    "several explanations have been proposed , all of which require further investigation . in the context of 1d models , mixing of fuel by rayleigh - taylor @xcite or shear instabilities @xcite might allow more rapid burning of hydrogen ; woosley et al .",
    "@xcite have again emphasised the importance of `` compositional inertia '' , that bursts ignite on the ashes of previous bursts ; narayan & heyl @xcite calculate linear modes of steady burning models , and find fuel is burned before the runaway .",
    "bildsten has stressed that solving this puzzle may require going beyond spherical symmetry , understanding both the burning front propagation @xcite , and the fuel covering fraction @xcite .",
    "some relevant observational facts are ( i ) regular bursting seen in gs  1826 is well - understood as mixed h / he bursts , arguing that other bursters such as ks  1731 - 260 are in this burning regime when regular bursting is seen  if so ( unless changes in covering fraction reverse the local accretion rate trend @xcite ) , as @xmath38 drops to the point where the recurrence time is @xmath78 or longer , a transition at low @xmath38 into pure helium bursts should be observed ; ( ii ) large values @xmath79 are often seen at high @xmath38 , implying that both h and he are burning outside bursts ; ( iii ) 4u  1820 - 30 has a similar luminosity at which regular bursting stops  if the same mechanism applies , it must be composition - independent .",
    "other sources show different behavior .",
    "in particular , sas-3 @xcite and later rxte @xcite observations show that bursts from 4u  1728 - 34 have helium like characteristics ( @xmath80 and durations @xmath81 ) , but become less energetic , stop showing pre , and occur more often as accretion rate increases .",
    "the burst fluence is proportional to the recurrence time ; very different to the @xmath32 constant fluence expected for mixed h / he burning .",
    "detailed models of the bursts from this source have not been made , but the observations perhaps suggest accretion of he - rich material , with very little h burning between bursts .",
    "the difference in bursting behavior is correlated with the spin frequency measured during type i bursts .",
    "ks  1731 - 260 @xcite has @xmath82 ; 4u  1728 - 34 @xcite has @xmath83 . for both sources ,",
    "burst oscillations are seen in the high accretion rate state only : for ks1731 - 260 , this is mostly for pre bursts ; for 4u  1728 - 34 , this is mostly for bursts without pre .",
    "muno and coworkers have shown that the correlation of the presence of burst oscillations with or without pre applies to other sources with spins @xmath84 or @xmath85 respectively @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a detailed analysis of burst properties would show that bursters with @xmath85 spins are similar to 4u  1728 - 34 , and those with @xmath84 are similar to ks  1731 - 260 .",
    "it is not clear what this is telling us , perhaps that the two groups of systems have different evolutionary histories , and hence accreted compositions and burst properties .",
    "a summary of observations of superbursts is given by kuulkers , this volume ( see also refs .",

    "basic energetic arguments point to ignition of a layer of fuel much more massive than a typical type i burst . for a nuclear energy release of 1  mev per nucleon",
    ", @xmath86 is needed to match the observed superburst energy of @xmath87 . at an accretion rate @xmath88 appropriate for these sources ,",
    "this mass is accreted in a few months . since helium ignites at much lower masses at these @xmath38 s ( and",
    "indeed these sources show ordinary type i bursts ) , the superbursts require a new fuel .",
    "theoretical attention has focused on carbon , which calculations show is present in the ashes of h / he burning , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "carbon ignition on accreting neutron stars was studied by several authors in the 1970 s @xcite ( originally as a gamma - ray burst model ) , and more recently for rapidly accreting neutron stars ( @xmath89 ) by brown and bildsten @xcite .",
    "these calculations found ignition masses of @xmath90 , giving characteristic energies @xmath91@xmath92 , and recurrence times 10100 years at @xmath93 .",
    "therefore carbon flashes initially appeared too energetic to match the @xmath94 superbursts and probably too rare to match the number discovered ( the superburst recurrence time is not well - constrained , but was at most @xmath36 years in one source @xcite ) .",
    "however , two pieces of physics act to reduce the observed energies and recurrence times .",
    "strohmayer & brown @xcite modeled the superburst in 4u  1820 - 30 as ignition of a @xmath95 layer with @xmath96% carbon and 70% iron by mass . because this source accretes helium - rich matter , stable burning is able to produce large amounts of carbon @xcite . at the peak temperature of the flash ( @xmath97 ) ,",
    "neutrino emission is very efficient and strohmayer & brown found that @xmath98% of the energy was lost as neutrinos , leaving @xmath99 to be radiated from the surface in the first few hours .     and @xmath100 ; the dotted line shows the pure helium triple alpha ignition curve for comparison . ]",
    "the other superburst sources accrete hydrogen and helium , in which case protons readily capture on carbon during hydrogen / helium burning .",
    "the amount of carbon produced is small , @xmath101% for stable burning , or @xmath102% for unstable burning @xcite .",
    "however , cumming & bildsten @xcite showed that even a small amount of carbon is enough to power a superburst .",
    "the key physics is that the heavy elements that make up most of the mixture have a low thermal conductivity ( this is especially true for the very heavy nuclei made in the rp - process ) .",
    "this makes a steeper temperature gradient , leading to ignition at a factor @xmath1 lower in column depth .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : carbign ] , which shows temperature profiles for different carbon mass fractions , and assume the heating of the layer is by a flux from below of 0.1 mev per nucleon .",
    "brown @xcite has recently emphasised that the flux from below is very sensitive to the thermal conductivity and superfluid properties of the crust @xcite , so that ( unless the carbon layer has an internal heat source ) this may be a promising way to constrain the thermal state of the interior . ] . for @xmath103 , almost all of the @xmath99 released leaves from the surface , since neutrino emission is not important at the lower peak temperature .",
    "the recurrence time is @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "is the carbon mass fraction , @xmath106 is the layer column depth ( @xmath29 ) . ]",
    "superburst sources have a small range of @xmath38 , @xmath107@xmath108 ( kuulkers , this volume ) .",
    "cumming & bildsten @xcite showed that for @xmath109 , the carbon burns stably before reaching the ignition curve , explaining the lack of superbursts at low rates .",
    "another possibility is that this is related directly to the change in type i burst behavior observed at @xmath110 in bursters such as ks  1731 - 260 (  3.3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "below the transition , where the accreted fuel burns in regular type i bursts , the carbon yield is likely very low ; above , where the bursts are short and irregular and not burning all the fuel , stable burning could produce significant amounts of carbon .",
    "an observational test is to compare bursts in sources with and without superbursts .",
    "the regular burster gs  1826 - 24 should not show a superburst in this picture .",
    "for @xmath111 , carbon flashes should still occur , but will be less energetic , and show less contrast with the accretion luminosity @xcite .",
    "long duration @xmath112 bursts are seen from the high @xmath38 source gx 17 + 2 @xcite , but may be too frequent to be carbon flashes @xcite .      a simple model of the superburst lightcurve is to assume the carbon burns instantaneously , without significant vertical mixing .",
    "this may be a reasonable assumption since the burning occurs much more rapidly than the convective turnover time ( opposite to normal type i bursts ) .",
    "the thermal evolution of the layer can then be followed as it cools , by evolving the entropy equation in time ( cumming & macbeth , in preparation ) .",
    "figure [ fig : gop3 ] shows a series of lightcurves for different layer thickness ( column depth @xmath106 ) and carbon fractions @xmath113 and @xmath113 are related by the ignition conditions , but for simplicity we treat @xmath106 and @xmath113 as free parameters  this also gives a model independent approach in which @xmath113 is just a measure of the deposited energy . for a similar approach see @xcite . ] .    at early times , as the outer parts of the layer thermally adjust , the radiative flux depends mostly on carbon fraction . at late times , after the cooling wave reaches the base of the layer , the flux falls off more steeply .",
    "a toy analytic model of the late time cooling is to take a slab with constant thermal diffusivity @xmath114 , and perturb the temperature close to the surface , for example at a depth @xmath115 .",
    "for a delta - function perturbation initially , the temperature evolution is given by the green s function for this case , and the surface flux is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the thermal time at the initial heating depth @xmath118 . at late times",
    ", the flux decays as a power law @xmath119 , close to the value found numerically .    for @xmath106 in the range @xmath120@xmath121 and @xmath122@xmath123 , we find that @xmath124 is radiated from the surface in the first several hours .",
    "the observed lightcurves agree well with these cooling models ; a more detailed comparison is in progress to see whether @xmath113 and @xmath106 can be constrained .",
    "the calculations shown in figure [ fig : gop3 ] assume that carbon burns to iron group after ignition , giving an energy release of @xmath125 mev per nucleon .",
    "however , schatz et al .",
    "@xcite showed that additional energy is released by photodisintegration of elements heavier than iron into iron group nuclei .",
    "the binding energy released in going from these heavy nuclei into iron is @xmath107 mev per nucleon , ten times less than carbon burning into iron , but for @xmath126% , this contribution dominates the energetics .",
    "this is an interesting additional way in which the nuclei made in the rp process directly affect the superburst energetics .",
    "type i bursts disappear ( are `` quenched '' ) for @xmath127 weeks following the superburst .",
    "cumming & bildsten @xcite proposed that the cooling flux from the superburst stabilizes the hydrogen and helium burning . assuming an exponential cooling law , they estimated a quenching time of @xmath128 days , where @xmath129 is the cooling time for the layer .",
    "this is a little shorter than the observed timescales of @xmath127 weeks ( kuulkers , this volume ) .",
    "however , the cooling models in figure [ fig : gop3 ] show a slow power law decay , @xmath130 , at late times rather than exponential . inspection of figure [ fig : gop3 ] shows that the flux reaches @xmath131 in a time @xmath132 , followed by a @xmath133 decay . assuming the stabilizing flux is @xmath134 @xcite gives a quenching time @xmath135 consistent with observed timescales . turning this around",
    ", a measurement of the quenching time allows the thickness of the layer to be determined .",
    "whenever the rise of the superburst has been seen , there is a precursor event that resembles a normal type i burst .",
    "a likely explanation for this is that flux from deep carbon burning heats and ignites the layer of h / he accumulating on the surface .",
    "this scenario has yet to be investigated in detail , and in particular outstanding questions are the relative timing between precursor and superburst , and whether the vertical propagation of the burning during the rise triggers the precursor .",
    "however , simple predictions of this model are : ( i ) most superbursts should have a precursor ( but not all , since a small fraction of the time the helium layer will be too thin to unstably ignite ) , ( ii ) a thicker helium layer will ignite with a lower flux , perhaps giving a correlation between precursor energy and the time until the superburst rise , and ( iii ) the precursor should be weaker than type i bursts at the same @xmath38 , since the mass of the h / he layer is less than the critical mass .",
    "the final point is that simultaneous modelling of normal type i bursts and superbursts gives an important additional constraint on the models of both @xcite .",
    "for example , strohmayer and brown found a recurrence time of 13 years in their models of the superburst from 4u  1820 - 30 @xcite , in which they inferred the accretion rate from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , using the regular type i bursting to calibrate the accretion rate gives a shorter recurrence time , 12 years for pure helium , 510 years for 10% hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the basic theory of nuclear burning on accreting neutron stars ( first outlined over twenty years ago , e.g.  @xcite ) has mixed success in explaining observed type i x - ray burst properties .",
    "the extremely regular burster gs  1826 - 24 shows remarkable agreement with models of mixed h / he bursts .",
    "the observed variation of @xmath0 with @xmath38 strongly suggests that the accreted material has solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "regular burst sequences from 4u  1820 - 30 agree well with accretion and burning of helium - rich matter . for this system ,",
    "observations of burst fluence variations with recurrence time would constrain the amount of hydrogen present in the accreted material @xcite , relevant for testing evolutionary models .",
    "superbursts fit naturally into the picture as ignition of fuel at a much larger depth than normal type i bursts .",
    "calculations of h / he burning show that the heavy ashes contain a small amount of carbon ( @xmath136@xmath137% ) .",
    "ignition calculations show that this mixture will unstably ignite giving rise to a burst with properties matching observed properties of superbursts .",
    "time dependent models of the superburst lightcurve show good agreement with the observed exponential decay times and energies .",
    "because stable burning produces more carbon than unstable burning @xcite , a self - consistent model of carbon production and ignition may require understanding the nature of h / he burning at high accretion rates where bursts are irregular and fuel burns between bursts .",
    "there is much to be learned from the interactions between superbursts and normal type i bursts .",
    "the properties of precursors and the time of cessation of bursting after a superburst will tell us much about the underlying layers .",
    "the global type i bursting behavior remains the biggest puzzle , and may well need new physics to explain it .",
    "another intriguing problem is how to explain bursts with ten minute recurrence times ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , not predicted by theory .",
    "there are many observational constraints which will allow progress to be made : variations of burst properties with accretion rate , shape of burst lightcurves , interactions between normal type i bursts and superbursts , and the properties of burst oscillations .",
    "we are slowly learning more about bursts at higher or lower luminosities than traditional bursters ( e.g.  @xcite ) . understanding the rich phenomenology of bursts",
    "promises to teach us much about these neutron stars and the physical processes in their outer layers .",
