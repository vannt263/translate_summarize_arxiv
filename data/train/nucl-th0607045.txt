    "the tensor force plays important roles in nuclear structure .",
    "the study of nuclear matter using the brueckner theory showed that the tensor force is closely related to the binding mechanism and the saturation property of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the almost exact calculations with very large model spaces exhibit a large attractive energy comes from the tensor force @xcite .",
    "the tensor force is inferred to be responsible for about a half of the single - particle spin - orbit splitting in light nuclei @xcite .    recently due to the development of experimental techniques , we can access to various kinds of unstable nuclei experimentally .",
    "those experiments have been revealing that the shell structures of unstable nuclei may change from those of stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "considering the importance of the tensor force in nuclear structure , the tensor force probably has an effect on such structure changes of nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the effect of the tensor force in neutron - rich nuclei is interesting and important .    to study the effect of the tensor force in a relatively large mass region in the nuclear chart including unstable nuclei , we have developed a framework based on a mean - field - type model @xcite .",
    "one of the most important tensor correlations in closed - shell nuclei is a 2-particle2-hole ( 2p2h ) correlation . in a usual hartree - fock calculation ,",
    "the correlation induced by the tensor force can be treated restrictively and the 2p2h correlation is hard to be handled .",
    "the effect of the tensor force is thought to be included in other kinds of forces like the central , ls , and density - dependent forces in the usual hartree - fock calculations . to treat the tensor force directly",
    ", we introduce a single - particle state with the parity and charge mixing considering the pseudoscalar and isovector characters of the pion , which mediates the tensor force @xcite . because a total wave function made from such single - particle states with the parity and charge mixing does not have a good parity and a definite charge number , the parity and charge number projections are performed before variation @xcite .",
    "we call this method the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) method . in the previous studies we applied the cpphf method to the alpha particle and showed that the tensor correlation can be exploited in the cpphf method .",
    "the cpphf method was also applied to @xmath5be to study the effect of the tensor force on alpha clustering @xcite .",
    "there are other attempts to treat the tensor correlation by expanding usual model spaces like a mean - field model @xcite , a shell model @xcite , the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite . those studies including ours showed the importance of the 2p2h configuration mixing and high - momentum components in single - particle states , which are not treated in usual model space calculations .",
    "neff and his collaborators took a different approach to treat the tensor correlation @xcite .",
    "they used the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) to make an effective interaction in a moderate model space . in their effective interaction ,",
    "the attractive correlation by the tensor force is included in other forces like the central and ls forces .",
    "they performed the calculations up to the second order perturbation based on hartree - fock calculations using their effective interaction and obtained a nice agreement of binding energies over the whole mass region @xcite .",
    "otsuka and his collaborators @xcite showed that a particle - hole ( p - h ) correlation by the tensor force is also important and changes single - particle spin - orbit splittings of neutron ( proton ) orbits with proton ( neutron ) numbers .",

    "finally , in @xmath4o the neutron @xmath176 is filled .",
    "s for the previously filled orbits change by this addition but the changes are not so large .",
    "the change of @xmath177 as shown above indicates that the large change of the tensor correlation energy from @xmath0o to @xmath1o in the strong tensor force case is caused by the blocking effect for the @xmath100=1/2 orbits .",
    "the blocking effect of this kind is shown to be important in the single - particle @xmath180-splitting in @xmath181he @xcite .",
    "the effect of the blocking is less significant for the excess neutron orbits .",
    "the effect of the blocking on binding energies in neutron excess oxygen isotopes seems to be small but the blocking may affect single - particle natures or collectivity in neutron excess oxygen isotopes , because the mixing probability is affected by the blocking effect .",
    "the negligible @xmath177 for the @xmath173 orbit indicates that this orbit does not contribute to the tensor correlation although there is no other occupied orbits which have @xmath100=5/2 .",
    "the main part of the tensor correlation comes from the @xmath182 channel .",
    "because the proton @xmath100=5/2 orbit is not filled in neutron - excess oxygen isotopes , the @xmath173 orbit is hard to contribute to the tensor correlation and the mixing probability of it becomes small .",
    "we have studied the effect of the tensor force in the sub - closed - shell oxygen isotopes using the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) method .",
    "we have extended the cpphf method to the cases with hamiltonians including three - body forces , although the extension is straightforward . in the cpphf method",
    "the parity and charge - number projections are performed before variation . by applying the cpphf method to the oxygen isotopes actually",
    ", we have found that a sizable potential energy from the tensor force is obtained in the cpphf method while in the hartree - fock calculation quite a small potential energy from the tensor force is obtained .",
    "we have investigated @xmath1o in some details .",
    "the correlation energy from the tensor force is about 10 mev for the normal tensor force case and about 40 mev for the strong tensor force case . in the strong tensor force case the strength of the @xmath133 channel in the tensor force",
    "is multiplied by 1.5 .",
    "the opposite parity components induced in single - particle states by the tensor force have compact sizes as compared to the normal parity components .",
    "this indicates that for the tensor correlation high - momentum components are important as already found in the alpha particle case @xcite .",
    "the present result infers that the importance of the high - momentum component for the tensor correlation is valid in heavier mass nuclei .",
    "we have also shown the density and the charge form factor calculated in the cpphf method .",
    "the density in the cpphf method is reduced around the center and is pulled in to the inside region .",
    "this is caused by the parity mixing and the shrinkage of single - particle wave functions of opposite parities .",
    "the effect of the shrinkage appears in the charge form factor as a tail in a high - momentum region , because the shrinkage of the single - particle wave functions induces high - momentum components in the density .    in the results for the oxygen isotopes ,",
    "the general tendencies for the binding energies and the matter radii are reproduced in the cpphf calculation with the effective interaction adopted here , while the agreement of the binding energy with the experimental data is not so good compared to the hartree - fock - type calculations with recent effective interactions .",
    "the root - mean - square matter radii are well reproduced within error bars except for @xmath0o with both the normal tensor force and the strong tensor force . in the strong tensor force case ,",
    "the matter radius of @xmath0o becomes smaller and close to the experimental data .",
    "the reduction of the matter radius in @xmath0o with the strong tensor force is due to the shrinkage of single - particle wave function by the strong tensor correlation , which is large in @xmath0o .",
    "because the @xmath7 neutron orbit is not occupied in @xmath0o , there are no blocking states for the @xmath178 proton orbit in the tensor correlation and , therefore , the tensor correlation becomes large .",
    "actually , the correlation energy from the tensor force per particle amounts to more than 5 mev in this case .",
    "for all the oxygen isotopes the calculated potential energy from the tensor force is in the same order as that from the ls force for the normal tensor force case . in the strong tensor force case",
    "it becomes about two times larger .",
    "in contrast to the potential energy from the ls force , the potential energy from the tensor force in an ls - closed - shell nucleus does not become close to zero in the cpphf calculation . in the hartree - fock calculation",
    "it becomes negligibly small because both the total spin and the total orbital angular momenta is almost zero in an ls - closed - shell nucleus .",
    "the sudden decrease of the potential energy from the tensor force from @xmath0o to @xmath1o is attributed to the blocking effect of the @xmath100=1/2 orbits .",
    "the blocking effect is also seen in the neutron - excess oxygen isotopes but does not affect the binding energy largely .    in the present study we have applied the cpphf method to the ground states of the sub - closed - shell oxygen isotopes .",
    "the application to odd - mass nuclei and open - shell nuclei to study the effect of the tensor force on single - particle natures and the change of collectivity by the tensor correlation in a neutron excess region are interesting because the tensor force changes the spin , the orbital angular momenta and the isospin of nucleon orbits simultaneously , which is realized in the cpphf method by the parity and charge mixing . as for an effective interaction ,",
    "we combine the available effective interaction and the tensor force in the free space with some modifications .",
    "we need to use effective interactions which have the connection with the realistic nuclear forces to reveal the relation between nuclear structure and the underlying nuclear force and have the consistency between the tensor force and other forces like the central and ls forces .",
    "the study in such a direction is also important and now under progress .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with prof .",
