    "the quark model describes mesons as bound states of quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath3 ) , much akin to positronium ( @xmath4 ) . as described in section  [ sec : quark - model ] , mesons have well - defined quantum numbers : total spin @xmath5 , parity @xmath6 , and c - parity @xmath7 , represented as @xmath8 .",
    "the allowed @xmath8 quantum numbers for orbital angular momentum , @xmath9 , smaller than three are given in table  [ tab : qns ] .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath5 smaller than @xmath10 , all allowed @xmath8 except @xmath11  @xcite have been observed by experiments . from the allowed quantum numbers in table  [ tab : qns ] ,",
    "there are several missing combinations : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these are not possible for simple @xmath3 systems and are known as `` exotic '' quantum numbers .",
    "observation of states with exotic quantum numbers has been of great experimental interest as it would be clear evidence for mesons beyond the simple @xmath3 picture .",
    ".[tab : qns]the allowed @xmath8 quantum numbers for @xmath3 systems . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^,^,>,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     with so little experimental evidence for this high - mass state , it is difficult to say much .",
    "we note that the observed decays , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are those expected for a hybrid meson .",
    "we also note that the production of this state is consistent ( natural parity exchange ) for both of the observed final states . in the case that the @xmath1 is associated with the lowest - mass hybrid state , one possible interpretation of the @xmath2 would be a excited state ( as suggested by recent lqcd calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "the mass splitting is typical of radial excitations observed in the normal mesons . in the case of",
    "the @xmath1 identified as something else , the @xmath2 would be a prime candidate for the lightest mass hybrid .      while no result has been published , the e852 collaboration has presented evidence at conferences for an isoscalar @xmath15 state  @xcite . the signal is observed with a mass near @xmath18  gev in the @xmath19 final state .",
    "it decays through @xmath17 and is produced in both natural and unnatural parity exchange .",
    "this conference report was not followed up by a publication , so the signal should be viewed with caution . however ,",
    "if confirmed , this state roughly lines up in mass with the @xmath2 and would be consistent with the lattice picture in which the @xmath1 is the lowest - mass hybrid and the @xmath2 is the first excitation  @xcite .",
    "the compass experiment has recently started looking at pion peripheral production similar to work carried out by both ves and e852 .",
    "two new facilities are also expected in the not - too - distant future , panda at gsi and gluex at jefferson lab .",
    "the former will study @xmath20 annihilation in the charmonium region , but it will also be possible to search for production of light - quark hybrids .",
    "gluex will use a @xmath21  gev beam of linearly polarized photons to produce hybrids .",
    "photoproduction of hybrids is interesting for several reasons .",
    "simple arguments based on vector meson dominance suggest that the photon may behave like an @xmath22 @xmath23 system . in several models ,",
    "such a system is more likely to couple to exotic quantum - number hybrids .",
    "early calculations of hybrids used the apparent large @xmath24 coupling of the @xmath1 to suggest that this state should be produced at least as strongly as normal mesons in photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the current controversy on the @xmath24 decay of the @xmath1 makes the underlying assumption questionable , which may be confirmed by the non observation of the @xmath1 by clas  @xcite .",
    "recently , lattice calculations have been performed to compute the radiative decay of charmonium @xmath25 and hybrid states  @xcite . in the charmonium system",
    ", they find that there is a large radiative decay for an exotic quantum number hybrid .",
    "these studies are currently being extended to the light - quark hybrids with the goal of providing estimates of the photoproduction cross sections of these states .",
    "however , based on the results in the charmonium sector , photoproduction appears to be a good place to look for hybrid mesons .",
    "over the last two decades , substantial data has been collected looking for exotic - quantum - number mesons . in particular ,",
    "searches have focused on hybrid mesons , which arise due to excitations of the gluonic fields which confine quarks inside mesons .",
    "models and lqcd predictions suggest that three nonets of exotic - quantum - number states should exist , with @xmath26,@xmath14 and @xmath15 , where the @xmath14 is expected to be the lightest .",
    "the most recent dynamical calculations of the isovector sector suggest a pair of @xmath14 states , with the @xmath13 and @xmath15 states similar in mass to the heavier spin - one state .",
    "calculations for the isoscalar states are currently underway , and preliminary results tend to agree with the isovector spectrum .",
    "work is also underway to use lighter quark masses .",
    "these masses are measured by quoting the pion mass .",
    "current work has pushed this to @xmath27  mev , and @xmath28  mev is in progress .",
    "calculations at the physical pion mass may be within reach .",
    "while not supported by lqcd calculations , other models suggest that exotic - quantum - number multiquark states could exist as members of an @xmath29 of su(3 ) .",
    "expected @xmath8 are @xmath14 and @xmath12 , where the spin - one states are expected to be the lightest .",
    "the spin - zero states may be similar in mass .",
    "however , in order for these multiquark states to have finite widths , some additional binding mechanism needs to be present to prevent them from simply falling apart into pairs of mesons .",
    "measurements of the @xmath8s , multiplet structure , and decays can be used to distinguish between these hybrid and multiquark states . however , to do this requires the observation of multiple members of a given multiplet as well as observation of states of different @xmath8 .",
    "experimental results have provided evidence for three @xmath30 isoscalar states , the @xmath0 , the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 .    the @xmath0 has been observed in both peripheral pion production and @xmath31 annihilation at rest .",
    "it has been seen decaying into @xmath32 ( in a p - wave ) , and even though other decay modes have been looked for ( such has @xmath33 and @xmath24 ) , no conclusive evidence for these has been found . while all experiments that have looked at the @xmath32 final state agree that there is signal strength in the @xmath14 exotic wave , the interpretation of this signal is controversial .",
    "explanations exist for the pion production data that describe the exotic wave as a non - resonant background phase , or produced by interference with non - resonant processes .",
    "unfortunately , these explanations have not been tested against the @xmath31 data .    if the @xmath0 is resonant , it is difficult to explain it as a hybrid meson .",
    "it mass is too low , and its single decay appears inconsistent with state being part of an su(3 ) nonet . describing the @xmath0 as a multiquark state is a more natural explanation .",
    "however , in reviewing all the experimental evidence , as well as the non - resonant descriptions of the @xmath14 signal , we feel that the @xmath0 is not resonant .",
    "the most extensive experimental evidence is for the @xmath1 .",
    "it has been observed in four different decay modes , @xmath33 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath24 , by several experiments .",
    "consistent results between e852 and ves are found for the first three decay modes , and from @xmath20 annihilation in flight for the @xmath17 mode .",
    "however , the @xmath24 decay is controversial .",
    "this mode has been observed by two groups , but not by two others . in one ( ves ) ,",
    "the strength is reported in the exotic wave , but they are unable to confirm that it is resonant . however , because not all physical constraints were used , their conclusions may be weaker than their data would suggest .",
    "a second group , e852-iu , explains the @xmath1 as feed through from the stronger @xmath34 state .",
    "however , while the intensity of the @xmath1 does depend on the decays of the @xmath34 , the phase difference between the two states does not .",
    "this can be interpreted as either feed through from the @xmath34 , or a resonant @xmath1 being absorbed by the @xmath34 . to resolve this controversy",
    "will likely require a multi - channel analysis in which physics beyond a simple isobar picture is included .",
    "even with this controversy about the @xmath24 decay mode , we feel that the experimental evidence does support a resonant @xmath1",
    ". however , confirmation with higher statistics would be helpful .",
    "identification of the @xmath1 as the lightest hybrid is not inconsistent with both model predictions and lqcd calculations , although some might argue that its mass is somewhat low .",
    "the current observations and measurements are also consistent with a multiquark interpretation , although our feeling is that this is less likely .",
    "observation of the isoscalar partners of this state would help to confirm its hybrid nature .",
    "unfortunately , models predict their decays into channels that are experimentally difficult to analyze .",
    "the evidence for the @xmath2 is much more limited .",
    "it has been seen by one experiment in two decay modes with very limited statistics while a second experiment ( ves ) does not see evidence for this state .",
    "what little is known about this state makes it a good candidate for a hybrid meson , but confirmation is clearly needed . if both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 do exist , then the @xmath2 may be a radial excitation of the @xmath1 .",
    "a result which is consistent with the most recent lattice calculations . as with the @xmath1 , observation of the isoscalar partners to this state are important .    beyond the @xmath35 and @xmath36 partners of the @xmath37 states , the crucial missing pieces of the hybrid puzzle are the other @xmath8-exotic nonets , @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "here , there is a single hint of an @xmath38 state near @xmath18  gev , but no published results to this effect . as with the @xmath35",
    "decays , those of these other nonets are also challenging , and to date , all the data that could be used in these searches has come from pion peripheral production .",
    "definitive observation of these other nonets would provide the missing information to confirm the gluonic excitations of qcd .",
    "fortunately , there will soon be four experimental programs running ( compass at cern , bes iii in beijing , panda at gsi and gluex at jefferson lab ) that can provide new information on these issues .",
