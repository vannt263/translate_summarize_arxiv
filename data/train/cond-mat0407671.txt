    "platelet - like type - ii superconductors in a magnetic field applied at some angle @xmath3 to the normal of their plane are frequently investigated in various experiments , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , even for the simplest case of an infinitely long strip placed in an oblique magnetic field , the critical state was theoretically studied only in the situation when the magnitude of the applied magnetic field @xmath4 considerably exceeds the field of full - flux penetration into the sample,@xcite @xmath5 . the attempt to investigate the critical state in fields @xmath6 led to incorrect results , @xcite since an essential feature of this state was overlooked , as will be evident from our analysis in sec .",
    "ii b.    in this paper we consider the following basic situation : a thin superconducting strip fills the space @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 with @xmath10 ; a constant and homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath4 is applied at an angle @xmath3 to the @xmath11 axis ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the thickness of the strip , @xmath0 , exceeds the london penetration depth , the critical current density @xmath15 does not depend on the local induction @xmath16 ( bean model@xcite ) , and the lower critical field @xmath17 is sufficiently small so that we may take @xmath18 .",
    "we consider two scenarios of switching on the external magnetic field : first , the magnitude of the external field increases from @xmath19 to @xmath4 at a fixed angle @xmath3 ; second , one turns on @xmath20 first and then @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , these scenarios lead to different critical states .    taking into account the result of ref .",
    "( see also refs .  ) , the smallness of the parameter @xmath2 enables us to split the two - dimensional critical state problem for the strip of finite thickness into two simpler problems : a one - dimensional problem across the thickness of the sample , and a problem for the infinitely thin strip .",
    "this splitting becomes possible since under the condition @xmath22 the magnetic fields and currents in the critical state essentially change along the @xmath23 direction only on scales which considerably exceed the thickness @xmath0 .",
    "the solution of the critical state problem for the infinitely thin strip is known.@xcite the @xmath11 component of the magnetic field is completely screened by the currents flowing in the region @xmath24 , i.e. , one has @xmath25 there .",
    "the length @xmath26 is described by the simple formula : @xmath27 here and below @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is taken as the unit of length ( @xmath32 ) . in this region of the strip ,",
    "@xmath24 , the sheet current @xmath33 ( with current density @xmath34 along @xmath35 ) is given by @xmath36 on the other hand , at @xmath37 where @xmath38 , one has @xmath39 with @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath43 in this region of the strip is presented in appendix a.    in the region @xmath24 of the real strip ( with @xmath44 ) , the flux lines are practically parallel to the planes of the strip and penetrate into the sample across its thickness from the upper and lower surfaces of the superconductor .",
    "the penetrating flux fronts form the boundary of a flux - free core , @xmath45 , which thus consists of an upper and a lower branch .",
    "below we consider only the upper branch since from symmetry considerations one has : @xmath46 .",
    "following our idea of splitting the critical state problem , we consider a small section of the strip around an arbitrary point @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) as an `` infinite '' slab of thickness @xmath0 placed in a parallel dc magnetic field @xmath21 and carrying a sheet current @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the critical state in such a slab is well known,@xcite and this enables us to find the flux fronts , the distribution of the magnetic fields , and the currents across the thickness of the strip in the region @xmath24 .",
    "since the critical state in the slab depends on how @xmath21 and @xmath48 was turned on , the above - mentioned dependence of the critical state in the strip on the prehistory of @xmath21 and of @xmath20 appears .",
    "of course , a similar procedure may be used in the region @xmath49 to find the distribution of the magnetic fields , but there the appropriate analysis is trivial since @xmath50 is constant ; we thus do not discuss it below .",
    "in the case of the first scenario of switching on the magnetic field when @xmath51const and @xmath52 has increased monotonically , it is convenient to introduce the function , @xmath53 , \\ ] ] which is proportional to the @xmath23 component of the magnetic field on the upper surface of the strip at @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "below we shall also use the two characteristic fields : @xmath56 and @xmath57 defined by the equations : @xmath58 \\over \\sin\\theta } , \\nonumber \\\\   \\cosh(u\\cos\\theta)=\\sin\\theta \\cosh(h_f\\cos\\theta),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is some parameter .",

    "the @xmath186 curves of scenario 2 scale even better .",
    "the nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath178 on @xmath4 can be understood from the following arguments : in the region @xmath24 the @xmath23 component of the external magnetic field , @xmath12 , leads to an asymmetric distribution of the currents over @xmath11 , see figs .  1 - 9 .",

    "one more interesting feature of the critical states in strips in an oblique magnetic field follows from the data of figs .",
    "6 and 9 : when the applied field increases , and hence the flux lines further penetrate into the sample , the current distribution changes not only near the flux front but also away from it , i.e. , in the regions where the critical state was established before .",

    "in which the critical state of a rotating cylinder was considered in magnetic fields perpendicular to its axis .",
    "these findings mean that this property of the current distributions in the critical states is characteristic of the general case when the geometry of experiment is not too symmetric , while the usual change of currents at the penetrating flux front occurs only in special symmetric situations ( e.g. , when the tilt angle @xmath130 , @xmath203 , or when the cylinder does not rotate ) .",
    "finally , we found the somewhat unexpected result that in an oblique magnetic field @xmath4 exceeding the penetration field , the current front separating the regions of the strip with @xmath163 generally is _ not a straight line _ and can shift in the sample when @xmath4 is increased further .",
    "the above general features of the critical sate are robust and hold even if the strip is not very thin or if its cross section is not rectangular , i.e. , these features are common for all critical states in _ nonsymmetric _ situations . however , the fine details of our results ( e.g. , the short tail from @xmath62 to @xmath79 in fig .",
    "2 ) require that all characteristic lengths in the plane of the strip considerably exceed its thickness . if some length of the flux - free core does not satisfy this condition , one may expect deviations from the presented results in this region of the core .",
    "furthermore , the temperature should be low enough that flux creep does not smear these details , i.e. , the creep exponent @xmath204 in the current  voltage law @xmath205 should be large .",
    "a detailed numerical investigation of the effect of flux creep is under way .",
    "note that the detailed shape of the flux - free core and of the boundaries between regions with opposite critical current in principle can be investigated via the in - plane component of the magnetic moment , while it has little influence on the magnetic field on the surface .",
