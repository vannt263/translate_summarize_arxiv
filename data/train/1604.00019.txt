    "a type ia supernova ( sn ia ) is the explosion of a carbon - oxygen white dwarf @xcite .",
    "it is hypothesized that in order to explode , these stars need to gain mass from a companion star via some mass transfer mechanism , be it roche lobe overflow , winds , merger , or something more exotic .",
    "the zoo of possible mass transfer mechanisms results in a similar plethora of companion candidates from white dwarfs to red giants .",
    "to date , there has never been a direct detection of a normal sn ia companion @xcite ; but there are indirect methods of constraining the companion identity .",
    "one method is to search for signs of the ejecta impacting a circumstellar medium ( csm ) produced during mass transfer , pre - supernonova outbursts , or stellar winds .",
    "the ejecta - csm interaction radiates across a broad range of the spectrum , from x - ray to radio",
    ". the csm composition and structure will reflect the nature of the progenitor system .",
    "we refer to any supernova with csm interaction as an `` isn '' . observations of isne are often interpreted through the @xcite self - similar model of shock evolution .",
    "this model has successfully been used to fit radio light curves of core - collapse radio supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supporting the hypothesis that the signal is from interaction of the sn ejecta with a wind .",
    "the key to the model s success in that case is that the csm is extensive and close to the stellar surface , so the shock evolves to the self - similar solution before observations begin .    in the case of isne ia ,",
    "the density profile of the csm is unconstrained by both observations and theory .",
    "observations so far have been used to derive upper limits on the density of _ continuous _ csm @xcite .",
    "however , sn ia progenitor models come in numerous flavors , many of which do not predict a wind - profile csm or even a continuous csm .",
    "for instance , a dense csm shell close to the progenitor white dwarf has been considered to explain high velocity features in sn ia spectra @xcite .",
    "several progenitors models suggest that nova outbursts will sweep csm into a shell of small radial extent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is the purpose of this work to characterize the radio light curves of supernovae interacting with csm in a shell .",
    "we restrict our studies to the case of low - density csm such that the interaction is in the adiabatic , optically thin limit . we also assume , unless stated otherwise , that there is negligible csm interaction prior to interaction with the csm shell .",
    "these assumptions are consistent with the fact that the majority of sne ia show no signs of interaction : if present , csm must be of low density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our model assumptions and guide the reader through our fiducial model set , which is defined by the ratio of the csm and ejecta densities at the initial contact point , motivated by @xcite . in   [ sec : shell_lcs ] we present our calculated radio synchrotron light curves for the fiducial set , demonstrate their similarity , and provide a system for paramterizing these light curves such that csm properties could be easily deduced from a well - observed light curve",
    ". then in   [ sec : high_vel_ej ] we relax the assumption that the csm and ejecta densities start in the ratio that defines the fiducial set , and show that the fiducial model relations can still be used to approximate csm properties even for these models . with that in mind , in ",
    "[ sec : obscomp ] we use our fiducial model light curves to analyze the probability of detecting shells in recent radio observations , given that there are gaps between observations . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : multishell ] we illustrate that a system with two shells will , upon collision with the second shell , produce a light curve that is significantly different from the single - shell light curves .",
    "the appendices provide the derivations of the radiation equations used in this work .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the hydrodynamic code used for this study and describe the `` fiducial model set '' .",
    "to model the shell interactions , we used the 1d spherically symmetric lagrangian hydrodynamics code of @xcite .",
    "the code solves the euler equations using a standard staggered - grid von neumann - richtmyer technique , and includes an artificial viscosity term to damp out post - shock oscillations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although this code can treat radiative transport via monte carlo methods , we did not exercise the radiation capabilities in this paper .",
    "instead our calculations are purely hydrodynamical with an adiabatic index of an ideal gas , @xmath0 , as radiative loses are small for the csm densities considered here .",
    "figure [ fig : paramspace ] shows that our models indeed do not trap radiation and do not cool , based on the equations provided in appendix [ app : tscales ] .    the exact number of resolution elements ( `` zones '' ) used in these calculations varied by model but was of order @xmath1 .",
    "as described below , the ejecta density profile has an `` inner '' and `` outer '' region ; the outer ejecta interacts with the csm and is important for the hydrodynamics .",
    "we asserted that the outer ejecta and csm zones had the same mass resolution . in most models",
    "we include a region of `` vacuum '' outside the csm shell , and in some models we include zones of inner ejecta .",
    "these regions act as buffers to ensure that the shock front does not reach the grid boundary and create numerical artifacts .",
    "the vacuum region is constant density at least a factor of @xmath2 less dense than the rest of the model , and the inner ejecta is much denser than the rest ; therefore resolution matching is infeasible in these regions and they are assigned @xmath3 zones each when present .",
    "the hydrodynamics code outputs files containing tables of gas properties at user - defined , linearly - spaced time intervals .",
    "we call these output files `` snapshots '' , and they represent only a subset of the numerical time steps taken by the code . note that , in general , snapshots are taken at different times since explosion for each model",
    ". therefore we linearly interpolate if we wish to know a model property at a specific time , introducing a small interpolation error .       and [ subapp : ssa ] ) , depicted in the @xmath4 plane , where @xmath5 is the csm density and @xmath6 is the initial contact discontinuity radius for a fiducial model ( equation [ eqn : rcss ] ) .",
    "note that models of different shell fractional width ( equation [ eqn : f ] ) occupy the same position in this space .",
    "lines of constant impact time , @xmath7 ( orange ) , and maximum ejecta velocity , @xmath8 ( equation [ eqn : vejss ] ; green ) , are derived from equation [ eqn : rcss ] .",
    "shaded regions show where our assumptions would be violated : when the shock region is optically thick to electron scattering and traps photons ( @xmath9 ) , the shocked gas cools ( @xmath10 ) , the csm impacts dense inner ejecta instead of outer ejecta layers ( @xmath11 , equation [ eqn : v_t ] ) , or the light curve is altered by synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ; @xmath12 for @xmath13 k and @xmath14 , equation [ eqn : tau_ssa ] ) . , width=326 ]    previous work on csm interaction has used the self - similar formalism of @xcite ( hereafter , c82 ) . in that model , freely expanding ejecta described by a power law density profile @xmath15 runs into stationary csm with density @xmath16 .",
    "the notations of these expressions are as in c82 : @xmath17 and @xmath18 are scaling parameters , @xmath19 is the time since explosion , @xmath20 the distance from the supernova center , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the power law indices describing the interacting media .",
    "the self - similar evolution allows various quantities , including shock position and velocity , to be simply calculated at any time .",
    "this formalism has been applied to various core - collapse supernova data with favorable results , and for this reason , as well as its ease of use , the c82 framework is prevalent in studies of isne .",
    "the well - deserved popularity of this model has motivated its use as a foundation for the `` fiducial model set '' of this study .",
    "following c82 , we adopt power law density profiles for both the ejecta and the csm .",
    "for the ejecta , we use a broken power law profile @xcite , which provides a reasonable approximation to the structure found in hydrodynamical models of sne . for sn ia models , @xcite suggest @xmath23 interior to the transition velocity ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 exterior .",
    "we are primarily interested in the outer ejecta ( @xmath26 ) , which has a density profile @xmath27              v_t = ( 1.014 \\times 10^{4}~ \\kms)~ ( e_{51}/m_\\mathrm{c } ) ,              \\label{eqn : v_t }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is ejecta mass in units of the chandrasekhar mass and @xmath29 is the explosion energy ( in this work , we take @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we assume that the power - law profile of the ejecta extends to a maximum velocity , @xmath32 , above which the density drops off precipitously .",
    "the ejecta is initially freely expanding with uniform temperature @xmath33 k ; the value of the preshock ejecta temperature does not play a significant role in the evolution of the shocked gas .",
    "the csm is taken to be confined to a shell with an inner radius , @xmath34 , and width @xmath35 .",
    "we define the _ fractional width _",
    ", @xmath36 , as @xmath37 in this work a `` thin '' shell is a shell with @xmath38 and a `` thick '' shell has @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xcite predict @xmath40 for the shells swept up by nova outbursts . in our calculations , we assume that there is no csm interior to @xmath34 .",
    "the csm at the start of our simulation ( the time of impact ) is constant density ( @xmath41 ) , constant velocity ( @xmath42 ) , and isothermal ( @xmath43 k ) . the chosen value of @xmath44 is arbitrary and unimportant as long as it is much less than the ejecta velocities .",
    "observations of variable narrow absorption features in sn ia spectra demonstrate the possibility of moderate velocities , such as @xmath45 in ptf 11kx @xcite .",
    "the ejecta impacts the shell at time @xmath7 after explosion . in our set of fiducial models , we set initial conditions such that the ratio of @xmath5 to @xmath46 at the contact discontinuity is a fixed value .",
    "physically , our motivation is that the interaction typically becomes most prominent once @xmath47 .",

    "we explore calculations with different initial conditions in   [ sec : high_vel_ej ] .",
    "equation  [ eqn : rcss ] shows that , within the fiducial model set , choosing @xmath34 and @xmath5 fixes the impact time @xmath7 , and hence the maximum ejecta velocity @xmath54 .",
    "figure [ fig : paramspace ] illustrates the values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 shown in this work , and shows that the fiducial model set obeys the assumptions of transparency and lack of radiative cooling ( quantified in [ app : tscales ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : hydro_ev ] shows the evolution of the energy and mass density profiles for a supernova impacting a typical @xmath55 shell model .",
    "immediately before impact ( panel a ) , the csm has low energy density , a flat density profile , and is moving slowly .",
    "the interaction creates a forward shock moving into the csm , and a reverse shock propagating backwards into the ejecta .",
    "the forward shock eventually reaches the outer edge of the shell at a time we call  shock breakout \" . at this time",
    "( panel b ) , the dynamics have not yet reached a self - similar state ; the internal energy density of the gas , @xmath56 , is high and the csm has been accelerated to nearly the ejecta speed . shock breakout accelerates the csm such that shortly afterward ( panel c ) , the mass and energy densities have dropped drastically and the outermost csm has reached speeds over @xmath57 . at a time 1.41 times the impact time ( panel d ) , the velocity profile has approximately returned to the @xmath58 of free expansion .",
    "the mass and energy density profiles will thereafter decrease according to adiabatic free expansion .",
    "the impact radius constraint @xmath59 ( equation [ eqn : rcss ] ) defines a fiducial set of single - shell interaction models .",
    "as we will see in the next section , these models generate a family of light curves from which it is possible to deduce csm properties .",
    "radio emission is a tell - tale sign of interaction and commonly used to study astronomical shocks .",
    "here we present radio synchrotron light curves of the models described in the previous section , using the equations given in appendix [ subapp : emissivity ] .",
    "these models are restricted to low densities where synchrotron self - absorption is not important ( figure [ fig : paramspace ] ) . calculating light curves",
    "requires that we parameterize the fraction of postshock energy in magnetic fields , @xmath60 , and in non - thermal relativistic electrons , @xmath61 .",
    "we assume constant values typically used in the literature , @xmath62 , but note that these quantities are a main source of uncertainty in predicting the radio emission .",
    "calculating x - ray and optical line signatures of our models is an exciting possibility for future work , but here we wish to focus on illustrating the radio emission produced by shell interaction and how it differs from the commonly applied self - similar model .",
    "we assume that the csm is of solar composition and that the conditions in the shocked ejecta are such that only the fully - ionized shocked csm ( temperature exceeding @xmath63 k ) contributes to the synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "representative light curves are shown in figure [ fig : phys_lc ] for interactions with shells of various widths , impact radii , and csm densities .",
    "the light curves initially rise as the shock moves through the shell and increases the volume of shocked material ( the emission region ) .",
    "the light curves reach a sharp peak , then rapidly decline .",
    "the peak occurs at shock breakout , which we define as the moment the radius of the forward shock front reaches the outer radius of the csm .",
    "the rapid decline can be attributed to the plummeting internal energy of the gas as the shell suddenly accelerates ( figure [ fig : hydro_ev ] , equation [ eqn : jnu_synch_3p ] ) .",
    "changing only the shell width changes the time of shock breakout and therefore wider shells  in which breakout necessarily occurs later ",
    "produce broader , brighter light curves .",
    "thinner shells follow the rise of the thicker shells until the time of shock breakout , as expected since the shock evolution should be the same while inside the shell .    in the left panel of figure [ fig : phys_lc ]",
    "we show how including the contribution of the reverse shocked ejecta affects the radio light curves .",
    "we use the same radiation parameters for the ejecta as for the csm ( except we assume metal - rich gas so @xmath64 in the calculation of electron density ; see appendix [ subapp : emissivity ] ) .",
    "we find that under these assumptions the reverse shock contributes negligibly ( about 10% ) to the light curve before shock breakout but becomes dominant at later times , when it has a much higher energy density than the csm ( see panel d of figure [ fig : hydro_ev ] ) .",
    "however , we stress that it is unclear whether the conditions in the postshock ejecta are the same as in the postshock csm ; emission from the postshock ejecta could be dimmer than we have calculated here if , for instance , this region has a lower value of @xmath65 . because of the uncertainty in how to treat the ejecta relative to the csm , in this work we do not include the ejecta when calculating the radio emission unless we explicitly state otherwise .",
    "the distance of the shell from the supernova primarily affects the impact time , as one may expect , and has a small effect on the peak luminosity reached ; the density of the shell primarily affects the luminosity and has a small effect on the impact time .",
    "when fractional width is held constant as is done when we vary impact radius and shell density , we see that the light curves have the same shape and are simply shifted around in @xmath66 space , as can be seen in the middle and right panels of figure [ fig : phys_lc ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : radio_lc_samp ] we show the light curves of our fiducial suite of numerical models ( having different fractional widths , csm densities , and impact times ) normalized by their impact time and early - time luminosity .",
    "this view confirms that changing the impact radius and csm density really does just shift the light curves in log - space and details of the light curve shape are governed by @xmath36 alone .    , and luminosity normalized to the luminosity at @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , when all light curves are rising .",
    "curves are color coded by shell fractional width , @xmath36 = @xmath69 , with logarithmic spacing between @xmath55 and @xmath70",
    ". multiple models of varying @xmath5 and @xmath7 are shown for @xmath71 ( red , cyan , and orange , respectively ) to demonstrate that the normalized light curves are nearly identical .",
    "reconstructed light curves based on the empirical parameterization described in ",
    "[ sec : shell_lcs ] are shown for @xmath72 ( black dashed lines ) , and provide an excellent approximation to the hydrodynamical model light curves .",
    "the slopes predicted for self - similar evolution ( @xmath73 , appendix [ subapp : selfsimlc_calc ] ) and for free expansion with adiabatic energy loss ( @xmath74 , appendix [ subapp : adiabaticlc ] ) are shown as dotted lines with arbitrary normalization ; they do not capture the shape of these light curves .",
    ", width=336 ]    for reference , we show in figure [ fig : radio_lc_samp ] the slope of the radio light curve predicted by the self - similar model ( equation [ eqn : lss_tscale ] ) . while at later times the shell light curves approach the shallow slope of the self - similar model , at most times this slope does not describe the light curve .",
    "we also show the decay expected after peak from a simple analytic model that accounts for adiabatic losses in freely expansion gas ( equation [ eqn : ladiab ] ) . the analytic curve is shallower than the decline from our models , as the models accelerate and expand faster than free expansion immediately after shock breakout .",
    "the similarity of the fiducial model set light curves is rooted in fact that the models all have the same value of @xmath75 , the initial ratio between the pre - shock csm and ejecta density at the contact discontinuity ( equation [ eqn : rcss ] ) .",
    "our next step is to quantitatively define the family of light curves so that any light curve can be cheaply reconstructed for a given @xmath36 and peak luminosity @xmath76 .",
    "first , we quantify how the fractional width of the shell , @xmath36 , affects the timescale for the light curve to reach peak , @xmath77 .",

    "this predicts that the time of peak is related to @xmath36 through @xmath83    if instead the shock is assumed to move at constant velocity ( as is true in the early evolution before self - similarity is reached ) @xmath84 so @xmath85 .",

    "the dimming is also due to the lower shock speed ( equations [ eqn : u_rhovsq ] and [ eqn : jnu_synch_3p ] ) . that the light curves peak earlier relative to explosion time is simply due to the earlier impact time .",

    "as we have shown here , by using the parameterized light curves and fiducial model relations one can easily quantify the probability of detecting shells spanning a range of @xmath36 and @xmath5 for a given set of observations .",
    "alternatively , one could constrain for instance the ejecta velocity and @xmath36 , and use equation [ eqn : vejss ] to analyze the likelihood of detecting shells of varying radii and densities .",
    "we have demonstrated that the light curves of ejecta impacting a single shell form a family of solutions that can be straightforwardly applied to the interpretation of radio observations . in these simulations , we assume that there is negligible csm interaction prior to the interaction being considered - i.e. the space between the supernova progenitor and the csm shell is empty .",
    "however , it is natural to wonder how it would look if one shell collision was followed by another : could we simply add the light curves , preserving their convenient properties ?",
    "in this section we perform this experiment and show that the light curves from multiple shell collisions differ dramatically from a simple addition of two single - shell light curves .",
    "imagine a system with two thin ( @xmath55 ) csm shells : shell 1 at @xmath164 cm with @xmath165 and shell 2 at @xmath166 cm with @xmath167 .",
    "the ejecta impacts shell 1 at 5 days in a self - similar model , and if shell 1 were not present the ejecta would impact shell 2 at 50 days ; therefore , models of the _ single - shell _ impact with these shells are called `` 1sh5 '' ( shell 1 ) and `` 1sh50 '' ( shell 2 ) . the double - shell model ( `` 2sh27 '' ) is the same as 1sh5 until shell 1 impacts shell 2 on day 27 . note",
    "that the earlier impact time ( 27 days versus 50 days ) is due to the fact that this second interaction starts not when the _ ejecta _ impacts shell 2 but rather when _ shell 1 _ does , which happens earlier since shell 1 is exterior to the ejecta .",
    "the initial condition of 2sh27 is the day-27 state of 1sh5 for @xmath168 plus the initial state of 1sh50 for @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the contact discontinuity radius between the shells .",
    "the number of zones in the 1sh50 csm was adjusted to match the mass resolution of 1sh5 .",
    "figure [ fig:2sh_synchlc ] shows that the 2sh27 light curve is dramatically different than those of 1sh5 and 1sh50 .",
    "first , the 2sh27 light curve is strikingly flat and broad , maintaining a luminosity similar to the peak luminosity of 1sh50 for nearly twenty days .",
    "second , the light curve has an elbow at @xmath171  days ( time c ; corresponding to panel c of figure [ fig:2sh_toon ] ) .",
    "note that in this figure , the 1sh5 light curve would in fact be subject to synchrotron self - absorption , an effect that we neglect here because it is not the interesting part of the evolution .",
    ".,width=326 ]        since our 1-d simulations do not have mixing , we can calculate the luminosity contribution from the shell 1 and shell 2 zones separately ( which zones belong to each shell is known by construction , as illustrated in figure [ fig:2sh_toon ] ) .",
    "when separated into the contribution from each shell , we see that the light curve is dominated by the signal from shell 1 .",
    "this is simply because of the chosen frequency of @xmath172 ghz ; in our model the ratio of cyclotron frequency in shell 2 to shell 1 is @xmath173 , thus @xmath174 .",
    "the shell 2 light curve also has an elbow ( time e ; @xmath175  days ) that occurs later than the shell 1 elbow .",

    "remember that shell 1 dominates the signal in the following narrative of the interaction : ( a ) _ impact . _",
    "shell 1 is much less dense than either the ejecta or shell 2 , and it is approaching shell 2 at high speeds .",
    "( b - c ) _ shock moves leftward through shell 1 .",
    "_ when shell 1 hits the `` wall '' of shell 2 , a shock forms .",

    "( d ) _ shock forms at ejecta - shell 1 boundary and re - energizes shell 1 . _ because of the new shock , @xmath56 increases and the light curve has another small rise .",
    "( e ) _ shock forms at the shell 1-shell 2 boundary , re - energizing both shells .",
    "_ we see that when the shock moving through shell 1 ( seen in panel d ) hits shell 2 , a new shock forms .",
    "the shell 2 light curve begins a dramatic second rise and shell 1 is able to maintain its luminosity .",
    "( f ) _ after a dynamical time",
    "the system has had time to adjust and the light curve begins to decline .",
    "_ this panel shows a snapshot just before the decline of both light curves .",
    "minor shocks continue to slosh inside shell 1 between the ejecta and shell 2 , causing the more gradual light curve fall compared to single - shell models .",
    "this is just one possible configuration of a double - shell system and its evolution probably does not generalize to the whole class of such collisions ; however , it illustrates that the evolution of these systems is distinct from single - shell model evolution and so produces a radically different light curve . note that higher - dimensional simulations may be required for investigating this class further because the significance of the `` shock slosh '' could be diminished by turbulence",
    "in order to quantitatively interpret the radio light curves and spectra of isne , one needs to understand the evolution of the shocked gas .",
    "one popular model for shock evolution is the ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  c82  ) one - dimensional self - similar interaction model , which assumes a continuous csm . here we explored moving beyond these models to the case of csm shells ( e.g. due to novae ) in the low - density case where the shocked csm does not cool and is optically thin .",
    "this removes the self - similar model assumption that the interaction has had time to reach self - similarity ( i.e. that the csm is close to the progenitor star or is very extended ) .",
    "we created a suite of models to explore the parameter space of shell properties , focusing on shell density , thickness , and time of impact . in our `` fiducial '' models ,",
    "we enforce an initial csm - to - ejecta density ratio of @xmath178 at the contact discontinuity ( motivated by c82 ; equation [ eqn : rcss ] ) .",
    "if the shell were infinite , these models would evolve to the c82 self - similar solution (   [ sec : mods ] ) ; however , because of the finite extent of the shells , self - similarity is never reached in our models .",
    "we calculated synchrotron radio light curves for these models , since this emission traces the evolution of the shocked region only .",
    "we found a similar behavior among the radio light curves of fiducial models ",
    "they peak at a predictable time ( equation [ eqn : plaw_peak ] ) , have the same shape ( equation [ eqn : asyml ] ) , and peak at a luminosity that can be calculated from shell characteristics ( equation [ eqn : empirl ] ) .",
    "therefore these light curves can be parameterized in a way that allows csm properties to be inferred readily from an observed light curve (   [ sec : shell_lcs ] ) .",
    "in fact we find that shell properties can be approximated even if there is a higher initial density ratio ( i.e. faster , lower density ejecta colliding with the shell ) than is assumed in the fiducial set (   [ sec : high_vel_ej ] ) .",
    "we then showed how one can use the fiducial models to better interpret radio non - detections of sne ia by applying our work to the radio observations of sn 2011fe and sn 2014j (   [ sec : obscomp ] ) .",
    "we presented a two - shell model to illustrate that our single shell light curves do not apply in that case , as a double shell light curve is much longer lived because of an effect that we call `` shock sloshing '' that occurs in the first shell (   [ sec : multishell ] ) .",
    "shock sloshing produces elbows in the light curve that may be an observable signature of this behavior ; exploring the diversity in multiple shell collisions is an enticing direction for future work .    our fiducial model set is a new tool for studying the interaction of sne ia with a csm , with the goal of constraining the supernova progenitor system . with the fiducial set",

    "<S> for decades , a wide variety of observations spanning the radio through optical and on to the x - ray have attempted to uncover signs of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) interacting with a circumstellar medium ( csm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of these studies is to constrain the nature of the hypothesized sn ia mass - donor companion . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous csm is typically assumed when interpreting observations of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , while such models have been successfully applied to core - collapse sne , the assumption of continuity may not be accurate for sne ia , as shells of csm could be formed by pre - supernova eruptions ( novae ) . in this work , we model the interaction of sne with a spherical , low density , finite - extent csm and create a suite of synthetic radio synchrotron light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we find that csm shells produce sharply peaked light curves , and identify a fiducial set of models that all obey a common evolution and can be used to generate radio light curves for interaction with an arbitrary shell . </S>",
    "<S> the relations obeyed by the fiducial models can be used to deduce csm properties from radio observations ; we demonstrate this by applying them to the non - detections of sn 2011fe and sn 2014j . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore a multiple shell csm configuration and describe its more complicated dynamics and resultant radio light curves . </S>"
