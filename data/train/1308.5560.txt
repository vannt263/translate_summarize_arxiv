    "@xmath8 of @xmath0 at @xmath5 is the set of all @xmath6 such that no zero of @xmath9 is strictly positive .",
    "hyperbolicity cones are semi - algebraic convex cones , as shown for example in @xcite .",
    "the interest in hyperbolic polynomials was originally motivated by the theory of partial differential equations ( see for example @xcite ) . but",
    "lately , interest arose in the area of optimization , especially semidefinite optimization ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the connection to polynomials with a _ definite determinantal representation _ has attracted much attention : a homogeneous polynomial @xmath10 $ ] has a definite determinantal representation , if there are symmetric matrices @xmath11 with @xmath12 and if @xmath13 is positive definite for some @xmath4 .",
    "note that both concepts , that of hyperbolicity as well as that of a definite determinantal representation , have been generalized to varieties of higher codimension in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that polynomials with a determinantal representation which is definite at @xmath5 are hyperbolic with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "an important result of helton and vinnikov @xcite says that conversely every hyperbolic polynomial in three variables has a definite determinantal representation .",
    "this holds no longer true for more than three variables .",
    "actually brndn @xcite found a hyperbolic polynomial @xmath0 in four variables such that no power @xmath14 admits a definite determinantal representation .",
    "more about these topics can be found in @xcite .",
    "a _ spectrahedral cone _ is a set defined by some homogeneous linear matrix inequalities , i.e. sets of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are symmetric matrices with real entries .",
    "spectrahedral cones are of interest since they are the feasible sets of semi - definite programming .",
    "one of the major open problems in convex algebraic geometry is to find a characterization of the class of spectrahedral cones .",
    "it is not hard to check that every spectrahedral cone is the hyperbolicity cone of an appropriate hyperbolic polynomial .",
    "note that hyperbolicity of a cone is usually easier to check than spectrahedrality : one has to determine the zariski closure of the boundary of the cone and check whether the defining polynomial is hyperbolic .",
    "there is no such criterion known for spectrahedral cones .",
    "the _ generalized lax conjecture _ states that in fact every hyperbolicity cone is a spectrahedral cone .",
    "every hyperbolicity cone is a spectrahedral cone .    here",
    "are some selected results concerning this conjecture :    * it is true for hyperbolic polynomials in at most three variables .",
    "this is a consequence of the above mentioned theorem of helton and vinnikov @xcite . *",
    "it is true for the hyperbolicity cones of elementary symmetric polynomials @xcite . *",
    "every smooth hyperbolicity cone is the _ projection _ of a spectrahedral cone @xcite . *",
    "it is true if @xmath17 is not a sum of squares in certain non - commutative algebras @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the generalized lax conjecture is equivalent to the following :    let @xmath3 $ ] be hyperbolic with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "then there is a hyperbolic polynomial @xmath18 $ ] , such that the following two conditions are satisfied :    a.   the product @xmath2 has a definite determinantal representation .",
    "b.   we have @xmath19 .",
    "our contribution is to show that if the hyperbolic polynomial has no real singularities ( which is generically the case ) , then there will always be such a hyperbolic polynomial @xmath1 that satisfies the first of these two conditions ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) .",
    "let @xmath10 $ ] be hyperbolic with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "assume that @xmath0 has no real singularities ( i.e. @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ) .",
    "then there is a hyperbolic polynomial @xmath22 $ ] such that @xmath23 has a definite determinantal representation .",
    "note that if one omits the condition that the determinantal representation is definite at some point , a stronger statement is true : if @xmath24 $ ] is a homogeneous polynomial , then there is a linear form @xmath25 $ ] , such that @xmath26 has a ( not necessarily definite ) determinantal representation , see @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "after some preliminaries in section [ sec : prelim ] we will recall in section [ sec : bezintro ] the notion of a bzoutian and remind the reader of some basic properties .",

    "then the module @xmath29 is free over the ring @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "we will call a symmetric bilinear form on its dual @xmath31 a bzoutian , if the corresponding @xmath32-linear map @xmath33 is even @xmath34-linear . the precise definition is given in [ def : bez ] . if @xmath0 is a smooth polynomial , then it is hyperbolic with respect to @xmath28 if and only if there is a positive definite bzoutian .",
    "this follows from classic properties of the bzout matrix which we will recall in section [ sec : bezhyp ] .",
    "if there is a bzoutian which has a sum of squares decomposition of some nice form , we can construct from that a definite determinantal representation of a multiple of @xmath0 , see section [ sec : bezdet2 ] .",
