    "finding paths between two vertices is one of the most fundamental tasks users want to solve when considering graph drawings  @xcite , for example to find a connection in a schematic map of a public transport system .",

    "not surprisingly , graph drawings in which a path with certain properties exists between every pair of vertices have become a popular research topic . over the last years a number of different drawing conventions implementing the notion of strong geodesic - path tendency have been suggested , namely _ greedy drawings _",

    "the notion of greedy drawings came first and was introduced by rao et al .",
    "motivated by greedy routing schemes , e.g. , for sensor networks , one seeks a drawing where for every pair of vertices @xmath1 and @xmath3 , there exists an @xmath0-path , along which the distance to @xmath3 decreases in every vertex .",
    "this ensures that greedily sending a message to a vertex that is closer to the destination guarantees delivery .",

    "nllenburg and prutkin  @xcite characterized trees admitting a euclidean greedy embedding .",
    "however , a number of interesting questions remain open , e.g. , whether every 3-connected planar graph admits a planar and convex euclidean greedy embedding ( strong papadimitriou - ratajczak conjecture  @xcite ) .",
    "regarding planar greedy drawings of triangulations , the only known result is an existential proof and a heuristic construction by dhandapani  @xcite based on face - weighted schnyder drawings .",
    "while getting closer to the destination in each step , a greedy path can make numerous turns and may even look like a spiral , which hardly matches the intuitive notion of geodesic - path tendency . to overcome this , angelini et al .",
    "@xcite introduced monotone drawings , where one requires that for every pair of vertices  @xmath1 and  @xmath3 there exists a _ monotone path _ , i.e. , a path that is monotone with respect to some direction .",

    "an even stricter requirement are so - called _ increasing - chord _ curves , which are curves that are self - approaching in both directions .",
    "the name is motivated by the characterization of such curves , which states that a curve has increasing chords if and only if for any four distinct points @xmath13 in that order , it is @xmath14 .",
