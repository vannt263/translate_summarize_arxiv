    "a star and its planets inherit their angular momentum from a common source :  the rotation of the molecular cloud from which they formed .",
    "it follows that the axes of planetary orbits should be closely aligned with the rotation axis of the star , an expectation that is fulfilled in the solar system .",
    "the rotation axis of the sun is tilted by only 6  relative to the axis defined by the net angular momentum of the planetary orbits ( see beck & giles 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the observed coplanarity of solar system orbits was the main inspiration for kant ( 1755 ) and laplace ( 1796 ) , who proposed that the sun and its planets condensed from a spinning , flattened nebula",
    ".    it would be interesting to know whether this degree of alignment is typical of all planetary systems , or whether the solar system is anomalously well - aligned or misaligned .",
    "the degree of alignment depends on both poorly understood initial conditions and poorly understood physical processes .",
    "for example , the angular momentum distribution of the parent molecular cloud is surely inhomogeneous at some level . the star forms",
    "earlier than the planets , and might consequently be composed of material with a different net angular momentum than the material that falls in later .",
    "the star s axis of rotation may be altered during the t  tauri phase , when much of its angular momentum is lost through bipolar outflows and magnetic coupling to the protoplanetary disk . there may be angular momentum evolution in the orbits during planetary migration , or as a consequence of gravitational interactions between protoplanets",
    ". the orbits may be altered by tidal interactions with the parent star , or torques from a companion star .",
    "it is even conceivable that there are planetary systems for which the orbital axes are grossly misaligned with the stellar rotation axis , due to a close encounter with another star , or the outright capture of planets from another star .",
    "the discovery of even a single example of such a system would be of interest .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to have additional cases besides the solar system for which the degree of spin - orbit alignment can be assessed .    furthermore , if it could be established that planetary orbits are universally well - aligned with the equatorial planes of their parent stars , there would be useful corollaries for some planet detection and characterization schemes , as reviewed by hale ( 1994 ) .",
    "for instance , the doppler method does not reveal the mass @xmath4 of the planet , but rather @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the inclination of the orbit relative to the sky plane .",
    "it would be helpful if the inclination of the stellar rotation axis @xmath7 could be safely assumed to equal @xmath6 , because then the various methods of estimating @xmath7 ( through estimates of rotation periods , line broadening , and stellar radius ) could be brought to bear on the problem .",
    "indeed , some investigators have already found it convenient to assume @xmath8 in interpreting radial velocity data ( e.g. , hale 1995 , francois et al .",
    "1996 , baliunas et al .",
    "1997 , gonzalez 1998 ) . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath8 , then stars that are viewed pole - on ( @xmath9 ) would be good targets for direct - detection experiments , since the planets would always be viewed near maximum elongation .    for transiting planets , there is a powerful method available to measure spin - orbit alignment .",
    "the idea is to exploit a spectroscopic effect that was first described by rossiter ( 1924 ) and mclaughlin ( 1924 ) for the case of eclipsing binary stars . during a transit , the planet occults a spot on the rotating surface of the star .",
    "the occultation thereby removes a particular velocity component from the rotationally broadened profiles of the stellar absorption lines . in principle , through observation of this missing velocity component , one can measure the line - of - sight velocity of the stellar disk ( @xmath10 ) at each point along the chord traversed by the planet , as well as the angle ( @xmath11 ) between the sky - projected angular momentum vectors of the planetary orbit and the stellar spin .    in practice ,",
    "the spectral distortion produced by the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect is difficult to discern in a single spectral line .",
    "however , when the entire spectrum is analyzed , the rm effect manifests itself as an anomalous radial velocity . by `` anomalous",
    ", '' we mean an apparent wavelength shift of the spectral lines that differs from the doppler shift caused by the star s orbital motion .",
    "if the planet blocks a small portion of the blue wing of the line , then the line will appear to be slightly redshifted , and vice versa .",
    "calculations of this effect were carried out by hosokawa ( 1953 ) , kopal ( 1980 ) , and most recently by ohta , taruya , & suto ( 2005 ; ots hereafter ) .",
    "the latter authors derived analytic expressions for the case of planetary transits , and suggested that @xmath11 could be determined within a few degrees if high - precision ( @xmath125  m  s@xmath2 ) radial velocity measurements were obtained throughout a transit .",
    "such high precision can only be achieved for bright stars , and the brightest star that is known to host a transiting planet is hd  209458 ( henry et al .",
    "2000 , charbonneau et al .",
    "this remains the only exoplanetary system for which the rm effect has been detected .",
    "three different groups have reported detections : queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , bundy & marcy ( 2000 ) , and snellen ( 2004 ) .",
    "most pertinent to this paper is the work of queloz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who measured the apparent radial velocity of the star during a planetary transit with a precision of 10  m  s@xmath2 , finding @xmath11 to be consistent with zero within about 20 , and @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 along the transit chord . and attempted to detect absorption lines in the atmosphere of the planet through the wavelength dependence of the rm effect .",
    "] since this pioneering work , a treasure - trove of new data has become available , including transit photometry with @xmath14 precision ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , radial velocity measurements with 34  m  s@xmath2 precision ( laughlin et al.2005 ) , and a recent measurement of the time and duration of the secondary eclipse ( deming et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the motivation for the work described in this paper was to investigate the degree to which the rm analysis could be improved using a combination of these high - precision data .",
    "we have also taken the opportunity to update the determinations of the other stellar , planetary , and orbital parameters , on the basis of the joint analysis of radial velocity measurements , photometry , and the timing of the secondary eclipse .",
    "the data on which our analysis is based are described in the following section .",
    "the model that was used to fit the data is described in   3 , including a new and empirical method to calculate the anomalous radial velocity due to the rm effect . in   4 we present the results , showing in particular that the uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath3 have been reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "we also remark on the determination of the orbital eccentricity , a parameter that has been of particular interest ever since bodenheimer , lin , & mardling ( 2001 ) pointed out that ongoing eccentricity damping could produce enough tidal heating to account for the unexpectedly large size of the planet . finally , in   5 we place the rm results in the context of theories of tidal interactions between planets and their parent stars , and consider the possible significance of this unusually direct means of measuring the projected rotation speed of the star .",
    "our work is based on three types of data : ( 1 ) radial velocity measurements of the parent star throughout its entire orbit , including the transit phase ; ( 2 ) optical photometry of the system during the transit phase ; ( 3 ) infrared photometry of the system during secondary eclipse ( the phase when the planet is behind the star ) .",
    "we have not obtained any new data .",
    "instead , we have chosen the highest - precision data that are currently available in each of these categories .",
    "our radial velocity measurements are from laughlin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used the keck  i 10  m telescope and the high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) equipped with an iodine cell for accurate wavelength calibration .",
    "a total of 85 spectra were acquired between november 1999 and december 2004 .",
    "they were generally taken at random orbital phases , with the notable exception of ut  2000  july  29 , when a sequence of 17 spectra was acquired during a transit .",
    "this transit - phase subset is obviously important for this work .",
    "the rest of the data is also important , because the keplerian orbit must be known with high accuracy in order for the radial velocity anomaly to be isolated and interpreted .",
    "we did not use the three spectra that were taken during ingress or egress because our model for the rm effect , which is presented in   [ subsec : rv ] , is least accurate during the partial phases of the transit .",
    "the radial velocities were derived from the spectra using the technique described by butler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and have a typical measurement error of 34  m  s@xmath2 .",
    "the zero point of the radial velocity scale is arbitrary . as noted by laughlin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a star such as hd  209458 should produce intrinsic radial velocity noise with a standard deviation of approximately 2.8  m  s@xmath2 , an empirical estimate based on radial - velocity and chromospheric monitoring of similar stars ( saar , butler , & marcy 1998 ) .",
    "this intrinsic noise , often referred to as `` stellar jitter , '' presumably arises from motions or flux variations of the stellar surface . for this reason , as an estimate of the total uncertainty in each radial velocity , we added 2.8  m  s@xmath2 in quadrature to the quoted measurement error .",
    "our photometry is from brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who used the _ hubble space telescope _ and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , sadly now defunct , to record the flux of hd  209458 within a @xmath1550  nm band centered on 610  nm .",
    "they achieved the extraordinary precision of @xmath14 in relative flux by using stis as a dispersive photometer .",
    "the resulting photometric time series is divided into 20 segments : on each of four occasions ( `` visits '' ) , the star was observed for five orbits of the telescope around the earth .",
    "the visits were chosen to span particular transit events in 2000 april and may .",
    "the first two orbits and the last orbit of each visit took place when the planet was not transiting .",
    "those data served only to establish the flux baseline for the time variations observed in the third and fourth orbits of each visit .",
    "following brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we excluded from consideration the data from the first orbit of each visit , reasoning that they are unnecessary and perhaps even undesirable because the telescope and instrument need time to settle into maximum stability .",
    "we also excluded all the data from the first visit , because those data were affected by an instrumental problem ( see brown et al.2001 ,   2 ) .",
    "the resulting data set consists of 417 measurements of relative flux , including excellent coverage of the entire transit phase .      the only successful detection of the secondary eclipse was recently achieved by deming et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who monitored the 24  @xmath16 m flux of the system with the multiband and imaging photometer aboard the _ spitzer space telescope_. they detected the diminution of total flux when the planet was hidden by the star , with a total signal - to - noise ratio of 56",
    ". for our purpose , direct modeling of the light curve is not very useful because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of each data point .",
    "however , measurements of the time and duration of the secondary eclipse are potentially useful in determining the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath17 ) and argument of pericenter ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the following expressions are valid to first order in @xmath17 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the midpoints of the primary eclipse ( transit ) and secondary eclipse , respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding durations .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath24 .",
    "using @xmath21 measured by deming et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and @xmath20 measured by brown et al.(2001 ) , we find @xmath25 which adds a little information beyond what can be learned from the radial velocities and transit photometry alone ( see   4 ) .",
    "the constraint on @xmath26 is not useful , because of the relatively large fractional uncertainty in @xmath23 .",
    "we estimated @xmath23 from fig .",

    "2000 , laughlin et al .",
    "the basis of the model is a two - body keplerian orbit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the orbit is specified by the masses of the star and planet ( @xmath28 and @xmath4 ) , the orbital period ( @xmath24 ) , the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath17 ) , the argument of pericenter ( @xmath18 ) , the orbital inclination ( @xmath6 ) , and the radial velocity of the center of mass ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "we chose to parameterize the initial condition by the free parameter @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 where @xmath20 is the central transit time , measured in heliocentric julian days .",
    "the reference time is the central transit time measured by brown et al .",
    "we did not allow @xmath24 to vary , since it has been determined independently with much greater precision than can be achieved with only the data analyzed here .",
    "we adopted the value @xmath34  days , which is based on an analysis of the stis data by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and a subsequent series of stis observations by charbonneau et al .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath24 is 83  ms which is negligible for our purposes ( see   [ subsec : rm ] ) .",
    "there are two more parameters for the planetary radius ( @xmath35 ) and stellar radius ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the transit occurs when the sky position of the planet is less than @xmath37 away from the sky position of the star , and @xmath38 .",
    "outside transit , the model flux is unity . during transit ,",
    "the model flux is computed under the assumption of a quadratic limb - darkening law , @xmath39 using the algorithm of mandel & agol ( 2002 ) . in this expression , @xmath16 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar surface .",

    ", we must take into account the rm effect .",
    "we write the model radial velocity as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the anomalous doppler shift .",
    "the value of @xmath44 obviously depends on the position of the planet and the rotation rate of the star , but what is the exact dependence ?",
    "since this is the heart of the matter , we devote extra attention to this aspect of the model .",
    "queloz et al .  ( 2000 ) interpreted their radial velocity measurements using a finite - element model of the star .",
    "they divided the stellar disk into 90,000 cells and calculated the expected surface brightness and spectral line profile from each cell individually .",
    "then , to simulate a transit spectrum , they summed the spectra of the cells that are not obstructed by the planet , weighted by the relative intensities of the cells .",
    "finally , to compute @xmath44 , they measured the apparent doppler shift of this simulated spectrum , presumably using the same reduction pipeline that they used on the actual data .",
    "ohta , taruya , & suto ( 2005 ) derived an analytic formula for @xmath45 as a function of the planet position and stellar rotation rate .",
    "using an analytic formula is much easier and computationally faster than using a finite - element model .",
    "however , we were concerned that the ots formula is based on a premise that may not apply in this case",
    ". the spectral distortion due to the rm effect is the subtraction of a small fraction [ @xmath46 of a narrow range of velocities from the rotationally - broadened line profile .",
    "the ots formula gives the first moment of the distorted line profile ( the `` center of gravity '' in wavelength space ) .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the first moment to be a good approximation to the measured doppler shift , but the butler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) method is not specifically designed to measure the first moment of spectral lines .",
    "rather , it is designed to find the optimal value of an overall wavelength shift that brings the observed spectrum and a template spectrum into best agreement , while also fitting for many other free parameters describing variations in the instrumental response .",
    "this method is not the same as measuring a first moment ; in particular , it assumes that any spectral distortion is instrumental .",
    "when presented with an intrinsically distorted transit spectrum , the degrees of freedom that are intended to mimic instrumental changes may absorb some of the true signal .",
    "for this reason , the applicability of the ots formula is not assured .",
    "our approach to this problem was to test the ots formula in a manner similar in spirit to the technique of queloz et al .",
    "we simulated keck / hires spectra taken during a transit ; then , we `` measured '' @xmath44 from these simulated spectra using the same reduction pipeline that was used by laughlin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; and finally , we compared the results with the predictions of the ots formula .",
    "the details were as follows .",
    "we began with the nso solar spectrum ( kurucz , furlenid , & brault 1984 ) , which for our purposes has effectively infinite resolution , and performed the following steps :    1 .",
    "broaden the nso spectrum to mimic the disk - integrated spectrum of hd  209458 .",
    "the convolution kernel was chosen so that the broadened spectrum had a line width of 4.5  km  s@xmath2 , the value measured by fischer & valenti ( 2005 ) for hd  209458 , and was computed assuming a linear limb - darkening law appropriate for the star s color and the mean wavelength of the relevant spectral region ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; gray 1992 ) . call this spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "2 .   begin again with the nso spectrum at the native ( unbroadened ) line width .",
    "scale it by an overall factor @xmath50 , doppler - shift it by an amount @xmath51 , and refer to the result as @xmath52 .",
    "this is meant to represent the spectrum of the occulted portion of the stellar disk : @xmath50 is the flux of the occulted portion , and @xmath53 is the mean line - of - sight velocity ( the `` sub - planet '' velocity ) of the occulted portion .",
    "3 .   compute @xmath54 , where `` tr '' indicates `` transit . ''",
    "this is the simulated transit spectrum at infinite resolution .",
    "4 .   multiply @xmath55 by the measured iodine absorption spectrum , which is also effectively of infinite resolution .",
    "convolve the result with a model point - spread function that is derived from actual keck / hires observations of hd  209458 , and store the result in the same digital format as reduced keck / hires spectra",
    "use the result as input to the same doppler - shift measuring algorithm that was employed on the actual keck / hires spectra .",
    "record the result as @xmath44 .",
    "this procedure does not account for any time variations of @xmath50 and @xmath53 during the spectroscopic exposure , but ots have shown that such time variations are negligible for exposure times less than 10 minutes .",
    "we performed the preceding steps for different choices of the input parameters @xmath50 and @xmath53 , producing a two - dimensional grid of results @xmath56 .",
    "we allowed @xmath50 to vary from zero to 0.02 , and @xmath53 to vary from @xmath57 to @xmath58  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting surface is very well described by a polynomial approximation , @xmath59 , \\label{eq : jj}\\ ] ] with differences smaller than 0.5  m  s@xmath2 between the grid values and the polynomial approximation .    in order to compare the ots formula with the results of our simulations",
    ", we calculated @xmath44 at each step of a planetary transit , using each of the two schemes .",
    "we adopted parameters for the planet and the star that are similar to those of the hd  209458 system . at each moment during the transit , we used the ots formula to calculate @xmath44 as a function of the planet coordinates .",
    "we also computed @xmath50 using the limb - darkening law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : limbdark ] ) , and @xmath53 assuming solid - body rotation for the star , which then allowed us to calculate @xmath44 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : jj ] ) .",
    "figure  2 compares the results of the two different methods of determining @xmath44 , as a function of the @xmath60 coordinate of the planet .",
    "the ots formula is a reasonable approximation of the simulated results , but it underpredicts the magnitude of @xmath44 by approximately 10% .    we do not know the cause of the discrepancy , apart from the general argument presented earlier that the quantity calculated by ots is not the quantity that is truly measured by the algorithm of butler et al.(1996 ) .",
    "in fact , we expected the ots formula to _",
    "over_estimate the magnitude of @xmath44 , given our previous argument that some of the free parameters in the butler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) algorithm might act to dilute the signal .",
    "we believe that our simulations provide a better representation of the true measurement , and hence , we employed eq .",
    "( [ eq : jj ] ) in our model of the rm effect .",
    "however , as mentioned in   [ subsec : data_rv ] , we did not attempt to fit the three radial velocity measurements that were taken during an ingress .",
    "this is because during the partial transit phases , the planet is closest to the stellar limb , which is when unmodeled physical effects are most pronounced .",
    "such effects include departures from quadratic limb darkening , variations of the limb darkening across the area covered by the planet , and any intrinsic center - to - limb variations of the line profile , including the `` convective blue shift '' ( beckers & nelson 1978 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the radial velocity anomaly of the model is calculated as follows . at a given time during a transit ,",
    "the positions of the star and planet are determined , and @xmath50 is computed with the procedure described above . the sub - planet velocity @xmath53 is computed by assuming solid - body rotation of the star ( an assumption whose validity is considered briefly in   [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : jj ] )",
    "is used to calculate @xmath44 .",
    "the description of the rm effect adds two additional free parameters to the model : @xmath10 of the stellar rotation , and @xmath11 , the angle between the sky - projected axes of the planetary orbit and the stellar rotation ( see fig .  [",

    "the elapsed time between the transit photometry and the transit subset of radial velocities was approximately 3 months , or 25 orbits .",
    "the 83  ms uncertainty in @xmath24 causes an uncertainty of only @xmath122 seconds in lining up the radial velocity and the flux data , which is much smaller than 4.3 minutes . even over the 5  yr time span of all the laughlin et al.(2005 ) measurements ,",
    "the maximum phase offset due to the uncertainty in @xmath24 corresponds to a timing offset of only 43 seconds .",
    "if we fix @xmath100 and allow @xmath24 to vary to best fit the data , we find @xmath101  days , which is 25@xmath85 larger than the externally measured period .    a more serious concern than the uncertainty in @xmath24 is the possibility that the transit radial velocity measurements are all systematically high because of stellar jitter .",
    "the time scales and corresponding amplitudes of these random radial velocity excursions are poorly known , but if the star happened to experience an excursion of @xmath125  m  s@xmath2 during the entire night of the transit of 2000  july  29 , then our conclusion regarding a nonzero @xmath11 would be erroneous . the only way to settle this matter would be to obtain additional radial velocity measurements during transits .",
    "two of the model parameters have variances that are notably correlated with the variance in @xmath11 .",
    "one of them is @xmath29 , the velocity zero point , which is easily understood since @xmath102 depends on @xmath29 .",
    "the second correlated parameter is @xmath81 , which is relevant because it controls the timing offset between the moment when the keplerian radial velocity variation vanishes , and the moment when the anomalous doppler shift vanishes .",
    "these correlations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_ross ] . also plotted is the joint distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , showing that the variances in those parameters are not correlated .",
    "the best - fitting values for the mass and radius of the planet , and for the radius of the star , are given in table  1 .",
    "the uncertainties in these quantities are dominated by the uncertainty in the stellar mass .",
    "these well - known degeneracies can be written @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the ratio of radii does not depend on @xmath61 and is determined with high accuracy from the photometry .",
    "cody & sasselov ( 2002 ) used theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution to show that @xmath36 is a _ decreasing _ function of @xmath61 , for fixed values of the star s observable properties ( luminosity , effective temperature , and metal abundance ) .",
    "if one were willing to use the theoretical models to set _ a priori _ constraints on the mass  radius relationship , then the degeneracy would be partially broken .",
    "the two parameters that describe the limb darkening are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the uncertainties in these parameters are highly correlated , and one linear combination of these parameters is much more tightly constrained than the orthogonal combination .",
    "the appropriate linear combinations are @xmath106 the variances of these parameters are uncorrelated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corr_lc ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "table  1 gives the results for @xmath107 and @xmath108 rather than for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , brown et al .  ( 2001 ) presented results for the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which we find to be correlated .",
    "some further remarks on the effect of limb darkening are given below .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limit on the eccentricity is @xmath111 .",
    "this agrees with the upper limit that was achieved by laughlin et al.(2005 ) using only the radial velocity data . but are the data consistent with zero eccentricity ?",
    "the answer to this question is important because , as mentioned in   1 ,",
    "the observation of a nonzero eccentricity might help to solve the mystery of why the planet s density is much smaller than the density of jupiter ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "formally , we find @xmath112 with 90% confidence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_e ] ) , but this result is highly suspect .",
    "we believe that the data are actually consistent with zero eccentricity , and that the lower bound on @xmath17 is an artifact of our imperfect limb - darkening model .",
    "although this problem does not affect the rm results or any of the discussion on which they are based (   [ sec : discussion ] ) , we digress here to explain the problem in more detail , and suggest how to correct it in future analyses .",
    "the natural parameters for describing departures from circularity are @xmath81 and @xmath26 , because the errors in these parameters are uncorrelated , whereas @xmath17 and @xmath18 are correlated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_e ] ) . in addition , the determination of @xmath17 is biased because @xmath17 must be positive ; random errors in measurements of a circular orbit can only increase the apparent eccentricity .",
    "in contrast , @xmath81 and @xmath26 can assume positive or negative values .",
    "the quantity @xmath81 is independently constrained by the measurement of the time of the secondary eclipse (   [ subsec : secondary ] ) , and is consistent with zero with a small uncertainty .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 controls the speed of the planet during transit and thus the duration of the transit ( the time between first and last contacts ) .",
    "however , the measured duration also depends on several other parameters , namely @xmath35 , @xmath113 , @xmath6 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "a bias in any of these parameters produces a corresponding bias in @xmath26 . is small and @xmath114 ,",
    "the only observable consequence of @xmath115 is a time - symmetric distortion of the transit light curve : a dilation or compression that is symmetric about the central transit time .",
    "time - symmetric distortions are also produced by varying the inclination and the limb - darkening coefficients , which is why there is a degeneracy between @xmath26 and those other parameters .",
    "] in particular , if the quadratic limb - darkening law is not a perfect description of the true limb darkening , then @xmath26 can be adjusted to compensate for the imperfection .",
    "if @xmath116 and @xmath26 is nonzero due to such a bias , then relatively large values of @xmath17 are allowed when @xmath18 is nearly @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "this is precisely what is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_e ] .",
    "the high-@xmath17 solutions are also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_lc ] as the extended `` wings '' in the probability distributions of the parameters that are correlated with @xmath26 .",
    "we confirmed that different choices for the limb - darkening law result in significantly different values for @xmath26 . in short , the quoted uncertainties for the parameters that describe",
    "the photometry are internal to our choice of limb - darkening law .",
    "because the present work is concerned mainly with @xmath11 and @xmath3 , which are not correlated with any of those parameters , we have not attempted to correct this bias .",
    "one could do so by adopting a more accurate or a more general model for limb darkening , and by incorporating multi - color photometry rather than the monochromatic photometry analyzed here .",
    "alternatively , once it becomes possible to measure the duration of secondary eclipse with much greater precision , eq .",
    "( [ eq : secondary ] ) can be used to place a direct constraint on @xmath26 ( though there may be a related bias in that measurement as well ) .",
    "through a joint analysis of all the best measurements of hd  209458 that are available , we have estimated the orbital , stellar , and planetary parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "our results agree with previous determinations of these parameters by investigators who analyzed subsets of these data , and in some cases we have modestly decreased the uncertainties ( cf .",
    "brown et al .",
    "2001 , deming et al.2005 , laughlin et al .",
    "the greatest improvement was achieved for the parameters describing the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for which the uncertainties have been decreased by a factor of 10 relative to the results of queloz et al.(2000 ) .",
    "this was accomplished by employing higher - precision radial velocity measurements and by interpreting these measurements with a new modeling technique .",
    "the angle @xmath11 is measured between the sky projections of two vectors : @xmath119 , the orbital angular momentum of the planet ; and @xmath120 , the rotational angular momentum of the star .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is a lower bound on the three - dimensional angle @xmath121 between these two vectors .",
    "the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath121 depends on the inclinations @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the planetary orbit and stellar spin axis : @xmath122 since the orbit is nearly edge - on , this relation can be simplified to @xmath123 .",
    "we expect @xmath121 to be not much larger than @xmath11 , unless the star s axis is pointed towards the earth ( a coincidence that is _ a priori _ unlikely and would also imply a stellar rotation speed @xmath124 that is considerably faster than expected for a middle - aged g dwarf ) . in what follows , we suppose that @xmath125  rad , and consider the implications .    this result is reminiscent of the planetary orbits in the solar system .",
    "relative to the net angular momentum vector of the solar system , the rotation axis of the sun is inclined by 6 , and the orbital angular momentum vectors of individual planets are tipped by 310 .",
    "the planet orbiting hd  209458 is similar to solar system planets in this respect , even though it is much closer to its parent star than any of the planets in the solar system .",
    "its orbital distance is only about 9 stellar radii , as compared to 83 stellar radii for the orbit of mercury . in this sense ,",
    "our result extends by a factor of 9 the range of orbital distances over which spin - orbit alignment has been measured .",
    "this proximity to its parent star raises the question of whether any novel spin - orbit interactions can be observed in the hd  209458 system that are not observed in the solar system .",
    "miralda - escud ( 2002 ) considered the interaction between a close - in giant planet and its parent star s gravitational quadrupole field .",
    "if the planetary orbit is inclined , the line of nodes of the orbit regresses .",
    "this effect is potentially measurable as a slow secular variation in the duration of transits .",
    "the precession frequency is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the semimajor axis of the planetary orbit ( in this case , @xmath128 ) , @xmath129 is the dimensionless quadrupole moment of the star , and @xmath130 is the angle between @xmath131 and @xmath132 . assuming @xmath133 ( a few times larger than the sun s quadrupole moment ) , the precession rate for hd  209458 is @xmath12@xmath134  yr@xmath2 , corresponding to a precession period of @xmath135 orbital periods .",
    "successive transits should vary in duration by a fractional amount @xmath1210@xmath136 .",
    "this is a minuscule effect , but it may nevertheless be detectable with high - precision photometry spanning several years ( see miralda - escud 2002 , ",
    "tidal interaction between the star and planet should also be considered .",
    "the planet raises a tide on the star , and vice versa .",
    "these tides dissipate energy , and the tidal bulges of one body exert torques on the other body .",
    "rasio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the orbit of 51  peg  b ( a typical close - in giant planet ) is formally unstable to tidal decay , but also that the timescale for orbital shrinkage is longer than the main - sequence lifetime of the parent star .",
    "likewise , tidal dissipation acts to coplanarize the orbit and the stellar equator ( greenberg 1974 ; hut 1980 ) , but we show presently that the timescale for this process is longer than the age of the system . using a simplified model of tidal friction , hut ( 1981 ) calculated the time evolution of a general two - body orbit .",
    "specializing to the case @xmath137 , and considering first only the tide raised on the star by the planet , the equation governing the evolution of @xmath121 can be written ( to first order in @xmath121 ) : @xmath138,\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the rotation period of the star ; @xmath140 is the dimensionless `` quality factor '' of the tidal oscillations in the star ( and is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate ) ; @xmath141 is the apsidal motion constant ( @xmath1420.01 for a solar - type star ) ; and @xmath143 is the dimensionless radius of gyration ( @xmath1440.1 ) . from this equation ,",
    "the characteristic time scale for significant change in @xmath121 is @xmath145 where we have evaluated the expression for the parameters of hd  209458 and a reasonable guess for @xmath140 ( terquem et al .",
    "since the age of the star is only about @xmath146  yr ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) , any inclination damping should be negligible .",
    "the inclination we have observed is therefore likely to be a relic of the planet formation epoch . alternatively , our measurement of a nonzero inclination could be considered as a weak upper bound on tidal dissipation , @xmath147 .",
    "the star also raises tides on the planet . through this mechanism ,",
    "the planet s rotation period is synchronized with the orbital period and the orbit is circularized on relatively short timescales ( @xmath148  yr and @xmath149  yr ; rasio et al.1996 ) .",
    "this is why the perturbing effect of a third body is required to maintain a nonzero eccentricity , in the scenario proposed by bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . however ,",
    "if the orbit is inclined relative to the stellar quadrupole , then the planet experiences a time - variable tidal distortion even after synchronization and circularization are achieved .",
    "the planet makes a vertical oscillation in the quadrupolar field of the star once per orbit . to investigate whether this oscillation produces a significant amount of heat",
    ", we followed the same procedure that peale & cassen ( 1978 ) used to calculate tidal heating within the moon , and that wisdom ( 2004 ) recently applied to the case of enceladus .",
    "we identified the leading time - variable term in the tidal potential and calculated the resulting height of the tide , approximating the planet as an incompressible fluid .",
    "for the case of hd  209458b , the time - averaged heating rate is @xmath150 to leading order in @xmath151 .",
    "this heating rate is utterly negligible compared to other sources of heat such as gravitational contraction and stellar insolation .",
    "a potentially more powerful source of heat is the tide that would be produced by a nonzero planetary obliquity . for a close - in giant planet with @xmath152",
    ", it may be possible for the obliquity ( the angle between the planetary spin axis and the orbit normal ) to avoid being driven to zero during the synchronization process , a theoretical possibility that has been explored by winn & holman ( 2005 ) .",
    "finally , we turn to the implications of our measurement of the stellar spin , @xmath153  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "because @xmath11 is nearly zero , the result can be interpreted as the line - of - sight rotation speed of the star along the stellar latitude traversed by the transiting planet .",
    "the stellar spin can also be estimated in the traditional manner , by interpreting the observed broadening of photospheric absorption lines .",
    "fischer & valenti ( 2005 ) did so for hd  209458 using keck / hires spectra , finding @xmath154  km  s@xmath2 . likewise , mazeh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported two estimates of @xmath3 , @xmath155 and @xmath156  km  s@xmath2 , based on spectra taken with two different instruments , and shkolnik et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found @xmath157  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "all these values are in agreement within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "the agreement is potentially interesting for at least three reasons .",
    "first , it is a consistency check on our method for interpreting the rossiter - mclaughlin effect (   [ subsec : rv ] ) .",
    "second , assuming that our method is correct , it provides a rare example apart from the sun for which the traditional interpretation of spectral line broadening can be checked .",
    "there are physical effects besides rotation that contribute to line broadening , such as macroturbulence and microturbulence . in general ,",
    "assumptions must be made about the magnitude of these other effects in deriving @xmath3 from the net observed line broadening .",
    "our result shows that for the case of hd  209458 , these assumptions are apparently justified . finally , if our method and the traditional interpretation of line broadening are assumed to be correct , then the agreement between the two estimates of @xmath3 places an upper bound on any differential rotation of the star .",
    "the line - broadening measurement is a disk - averaged quantity , whereas the transit measurement refers specifically to a latitude of @xmath158 .",
    "together , the two measurements imply @xmath159  km  s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath160% of the average rotation speed .",
    "unfortunately , we lack the precision to detect the degree of differential rotation expected of a solar - type star . on the sun ,",
    "differential rotation between the equator and latitude @xmath158 is only about 0.1  km  s@xmath2 , or 5% of the equatorial speed ( beck 2000 ) , and of course the difference between the disk - averaged rotation and the rotation at latitude 30  is even smaller .    in closing , we wish to point out that although hd  209458 is presently the only extrasolar planetary system for which the rossiter - mclaughlin effect has been detected , it is possible that a large sample of suitable systems will soon be available .",
    "a second example of a transiting planet with a bright parent star was recently discovered : tres-1 , whose parent star is a 12th magnitude k  dwarf ( alonso et al.2004 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis of this system , given the different stellar type and planetary characteristics .",
    "numerous wide - field surveys for transiting planets are underway , which we hope will provide a bounty of additional targets in the near future .",
