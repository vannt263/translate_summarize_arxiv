    "a property of luminous blue variables both in outburst and quiescense is the occurrence of extremely broad balmer emission wings , usually ascribed to electron scattering in dense extended atmospheres or envelopes ( bernat & lambert 1978 ; hubeny & leitherer 1989 ; santolaya - rey et  al .",

    "similar profiles are observed in some very luminous galactic b  supergiants with no evidence of previous lbv activity ( e.g. , lennon et  al .",
    "1992 ; marco & negueruela 2009 ; clark et  al .",
    "2012 ) , although it would not be surprising if these objects were approaching the lbv stage .",
    "a puzzling property of the h@xmath0 wings is their apparent asymmetry , more extended and shallow shortward but curtailed and steeper longward . as emphasized by hutsemkers & van drom , that morphology can not be produced by electron scattering ; moreover , it is not shared by h@xmath1 . here",
    "we propose a likely resolution of this discrepancy .",
    "we report the discovery of these broad balmer wings in five ba hyper / supergiants in or near the 30  doradus nebula of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , but again , with no record or known evidence of outbursts .",
    "the only confirmed lbv in the 30  dor region is radcliffe ( r ) 143 ( feast et  al .  1960 ) , located in an evolved association immediately se of the main tarantula nebula ( walborn & blades 1997 ) .",

    "( 1998 ; see also weis 2003 ) subsequently found ejected nitrogen - rich circumstellar nebulosity , another frequent characteristic of lbvs and indicative of a larger , earlier eruption .",
    "the spectra , locations , and known variability of these five 30  dor objects , one of which may be associated with r143 , are discussed below , as well as a search for circumstellar nebulae .",
    "the primary spectroscopic data used here are from the vlt - flames tarantula survey ( vfts ; eso large programme 182.d-0222 , pi cje ) . full details of the instrumental parameters and data reductions were provided by evans et  al .",

    "in addition , the h@xmath1 region was observed with the hr15n setting at r of 16,000 .",
    "most of the observations were done during 2008 october through 2009 february , with a final epoch in 2009 october to extend the binary period sensitivity .",
    "the locations of the five vfts objects in the field of 30  dor are shown in figure  1 , along with that of r143 . coordinates and photometry are provided by evans et al .",

    "several interesting common properties of these balmer profiles are discussed here , while further details of the individual objects and spectra are considered in following subsections .",
    "the similar , marked asymmetry of the broad h@xmath0 wings in all the objects is remarkable and characteristic : the shortward wings are more extended and shallower , while the longward ones are shorter and steeper ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the broad emission has a full width at zero intensity of @xmath250    or 3000  km  s@xmath3 , far too large to be ascribed to a doppler effect , which is why such profiles have been interpreted in terms of electron scattering .",
    "( typical wind terminal velocities of galactic b12 hypergiants are a few hundred km  s@xmath3 ; crowther et  al .",
    "2006 , clark et  al .  2012 . ) in luminous late - b and a  supergiants with lower mass - loss rates , peculiar balmer emission profiles can be produced by nlte effects ( hubeny & leitherer 1989 ; santolaya - rey et  al .",
    "1997 ; puls et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "the observed peak intensities of the broad emission wings are 13% relative to the continuum .",
    "the h@xmath1 wings are entirely different from those of h@xmath0 , with a broad absorption depression in the _ shortward _ one .",
    "our first thought on the latter was a feature related to the stellar winds , although its similarity across the entire b - type spectral range ( figure  2 ) was disconcerting , as was its extent relative to the stellar - wind velocities of such objects .",
    "subsequently , we realized that the depths of these features are correlated with the reddenings of the stars , immediately suggesting an origin related to extinction and consultation of herbig ( 1995 ) , who indeed lists a broad , shallow diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) centered at 6533   , with a fwhm of 21   , in good agreement with the data .",
    "an analogous origin of the h@xmath0 asymmetry was then suggested by the extreme case of cygnus ob2 - 12 , as shown in figure  4 . here",
    "the dib responsible is centered at 4882    with fwhm 25    according to herbig , but maz apellniz et  al .",

    "profiles ( black ) to show the very similar , extensive asymmetrical wings in all of the spectra , with the corresponding h@xmath1 profiles ( red ) superimposed .",
    "the narrow h@xmath0 emission in vfts  533 is a blend of a stellar p  cygni profile and nebular emission , whereas in vfts  003 it is dominated by the stellar profile , but in vfts  458 and 424 it is entirely nebular .",
    "the apparent shortward , broad absorption troughs in the h@xmath1 profiles are actually the diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) at 6533    ( herbig 1995 ; walborn & howarth 2000 ) ; @xmath4 ranges from 0.30 to 0.68 for these objects , with the largest value corresponding to vfts  458 .",
    "the vfts  739 profile has been shifted by + 0.2 continuum unit for clarity . ]     in the spectrum of the extremely reddened star cygnus ob2 - 12 ( @xmath5 , or @xmath6(4405@xmath75495 )  =  3.79 ; maz apellniz 2013 ) , as observed ( black ) and with the strong dibs subtracted ( blue ) , together with an approximate gaussian fit to the broad emission component ( red ) .",
    "while the fit is not perfect , it indicates that the asymmetry of the observed broad wings is essentially caused by the longward dibs .",
    "these data are from the galactic o - star spectroscopic survey ( gosss ; maz apellniz et  al .",
    "2011 ) ; they have a resolving power of 2500 obtained at the gran telescopio canarias and will be fully discussed in a subsequent publication . ]",
    "this luminous b supergiant is located only 28 from and is most likely associated in a small cluster with the wc4  +  o6 - 6.5  iii system hd  38029a  =  vfts  002 ( evans et  al .",
    "2011 ) , which is currently much fainter in the optical but likely also descends from a very massive progenitor . to our knowledge ,",
    "vfts  003 lacks accurate , spatially resolved optical photometry ; in fact , there is confusion in the literature about the magnitudes of the two stars .",
    "remarkably , sanduleak ( 1970 ) resolved them and correctly gave their relative positions and magnitudes ; in particular , he lists m@xmath8 of 11.8 for the b  supergiant and 14.2 for the wc system .",
    "however , breysacher et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) quote a @xmath9  magnitude of 11.75 for the `` wc star , '' which clearly corresponds primarily to the b  supergiant instead .",
    "the same remark applies to the magnitudes listed by simbad , except for @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the issue was correctly resolved by prevot - burnichon et  al .",
    "( 1981 ) . in any event",
    ", this association should eventually yield valuable mutual clues to the basic parameters of both evolved objects .",
    "the vfts  002/003 system is located at the edge of the survey field , far sw of the tarantula nebula , and is thus not directly associated with it ( fig .  1 ) .    the h@xmath0 profile ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows the classic `` prussian helmet '' morphology , with a narrow p  cygni profile superimposed on the broad emission wings . since this star is not near strong hii emission ,",
    "a significant nebular contribution is not expected .",
    "the spectral type of b1  ia@xmath11p is the earliest among the present sample ; it is based upon the siiv / siiii and siiii / hei absorption - line ratios ( fig .",
    "2 ) for the temperature and luminosity classes , respectively , allowing for lmc metal deficiency in the latter ( fitzpatrick 1991 ) .",
    "the `` p '' is due to the h@xmath0 profile .",
    "the nii spectrum is very strong , morphologically normal for the spectral type , which is expected to correspond to a significant physical enhancement .",
    "indeed , mcevoy et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) have derived log(n / h)+12 ( hereafter n / h )  =  8.0 for vfts  003 ; for comparison , kurt & dufour ( 1998 ) give an lmc baseline n / h of 6.9 determined from hii regions .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile again appears to show the classic `` prussian helmet '' morphology , although in this case there is a substantial , blended nebular contribution to the narrow emission . unlike in vfts  003",
    ", the narrow h@xmath1 structure is very similar to that of h@xmath0 . for reference in the context of the dibs , @xmath12 .",
    "the spectral type is b1.5  ia@xmath11p  nwk .",
    "remarkably for a very high - luminosity object possibly nearing the lbv phase , the nitrogen lines are weaker than those of oxygen and carbon ; while the n  ii lines are well marked , they are too weak for the spectral type , and the oii spectrum is much stronger . compared with vfts  003 discussed above , the slightly later type of vfts  533 places it nearer to the normal nii maximum at b2 , exacerbating the discrepancy .",
    "fitzpatrick ( 1991 ) found the same anomalous nitrogen deficiency in the lmc b12 hypergiants sanduleak ( 1970 , sk ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , as well as in several slightly less luminous supergiants .",
    "another striking comparison of n - weak and n - strong objects at this type from the vfts sample is shown by evans et  al .",
    "( 2015 , their fig .  1 ) .",
    "mcevoy et  al .",
    "( 2015 ) have derived n / h of 7.4 for vfts  533 , consistent with the morphological appearance of the spectrum . with respect to the lmc baseline abundance cited above",
    ", the vfts  533 value is certainly enhanced , but far less than that of other hyper / supergiants , e.g. , vfts  003 .",
    "parker ( 1993 ) derived a spectral type of b0  ia , and walborn & blades ( 1997 ; data from 1982 ) b0.5-b0.7  i ; while the quality of the present data is far superior , nevertheless both of those classifications imply siiv line strengths much greater than seen here .",
    "thus a real spectral variation during an interval of 26  years appears likely .",
    "moreover , the depth of the absorption component in the narrow p  cyg profile at h@xmath0 increased by a factor of two to 20% of the continuum between vfts epochs of 2008 october and december . during the same interval the metallic lines underwent a radial - velocity decrease of 12  km  s@xmath3 and a small intensity decrease , perhaps consistent with atmospheric motions as in the galactic supergiant sher  25 ( taylor et  al .",
    "2014 ) .    as shown in fig .  1",
    ", this star is located just n(e ) of r136 at the center of the nebula .",
    "however , it lies among the older stars identified as a separate cluster by sabbi et  al .",
    "indeed , this spectral type is unlikely to be associated with the 12  myr old , extremely early o and supermassive wnh stars in r136 ( crowther et  al .",
    "2010 ; crowther et  al .  in prep .",
    ") nevertheless , it is an extremely luminous star : with @xmath16 , it is one magnitude brighter than the typical ia ( walborn 1972 ) . with the bolometric corrections listed by walborn et  al .",
    "( 2008 , table  2 ) , the corresponding @xmath17 is @xmath710 .      in this case",
    ", the narrow h@xmath0 emission appears to be nebular , centered within a stellar absorption feature that in turn reverses the broad emission .",
    "it is probably not a coincidence that the spectral type is much later than those of vfts  003 and 533 , i.e. , b9.5  ia@xmath11p with very strong siii , mgii , and feii absorption lines .",
    "the presence of nii @xmath183995 at such a late type , albeit weak , may indicate an overabundance .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission profile is also a stellar / nebular composite ; in this case @xmath19 .    vfts  424 is also very near r136 , although on the opposite ( n)w side from vfts  533 .",
    "still , it is most likely associated with the older population related to the sabbi et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) cluster ; see also walborn & blades ( 1997 ) and selman et  al .  ( 1999 ) for more on the distribution of this population .",
    "vfts  424 is also highly luminous , again with @xmath16 , albeit with @xmath17 only @xmath78.4 because of the lower temperature .",
    "this star was suggested as an lbv candidate by walborn & blades ( 1997 ) , albeit for different reasons ; their data did not cover h@xmath0 .",
    "although the s / n was low , nii @xmath183995 appeared to be present with a strength greater than that of the adjacent hei @xmath184009 , an anomaly for the spectral type of b6  ia@xmath11p .",
    "there also appeared to be a broad absorption consistent with an feii complex at 45504650   .",
    "ironically , neither of those features has the same appearance in the superior vfts data ( fig .",
    "2 ) , although @xmath183995 and other nii lines are still too strong for the spectral type .",
    "the apparent broad feature is resolved into nii and feii lines in the vfts data .",
    "mcevoy et  al .",
    "derive n / h  =  8.0 .",
    "the triple h@xmath0 structure is very similar to that of vfts  424 and likely has similar origins .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission is again a stellar / nebular composite , and @xmath20 is the largest in this sample consistent with the strongest @xmath186533 dib .",
    "vfts  458  =  parker  ( 1993 )  662 is located about 2@xmath21 ( 30  pc in projection ) south of r136 , near the previously known lbv r143 and within the `` r143 association '' first distinguished and discussed by walborn & blades ( 1997 ) .",
    "it also has @xmath16 ( as does r143 itself in its current state ) , and @xmath17 of @xmath78.6 .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile of this star consists of only two components : the very broad emission wings and an approximately central stellar absorption reversal ( fig .",
    "note that the lack of a central emission feature definitely eliminates electron scattering as the origin of the broad wings in this profile ( cf .",
    "hutsemkers & van drom 1991 ) .",
    "remarkably , its h@xmath1 profile displays a second set of stronger , be - like emission wings with a peak - to - peak separation of only 3.3    or 150  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "such a profile in a supergiant does not necessarily imply the presence of a disk , as it can be produced by nlte radiative transfer effects , as can the broad wings ( hubeny & leitherer 1989 ; puls et  al .",
    "1998 ) . as further discussed in the next paragraph , this star is far from any nebulosity , thus supporting the interpretation of the profiles in the previous two spectra .",
    "the spectral type of a0  iap is the latest of the five objects discussed here , while @xmath22 .",
    "vfts  739 does not belong to 30  dor per se but is located even further to the south , at the northern edge of a large region of other discrete ob associations and scattered `` field '' stars .",
    "the comparably bright star to its immediate se in fig .",
    "1 is vfts  764  =  sk  @xmath23 of type o9.7  ia  nstr ( walborn et  al .",
    "2014 ) , also indicative of a fairly advanced evolutionary  stage .",
    "mcevoy et  al .",
    "derive n / h  =  7.8 for vfts  764 .",
    "the @xmath24 of vfts  739 is @xmath77.2 ( @xmath17 @xmath77.3 ) , while that of vfts  764 is @xmath77.4 ( @xmath17 @xmath710.2 ) .",
    "in addition to spectroscopic characteristics , photometric histories and circumstellar nebulae may provide information about the status of candidate or precursor lbvs . here",
    "we briefly describe the results of some inquiries in those areas .",
    "some galactic counterparts to these vfts objects and lbvs with similar balmer profiles are also listed .",
    "we investigated our targets in the asas and the ogle shallow databases .",
    "the asas @xmath25  data show apparent variability of vfts  458 at the 1  mag level and of vfts  739 at 0.3  mag . however , we are concerned about the bright nebulosity associated with the former ( next subsection ) and the latter range is near the accuracy limit .",
    "indeed , the more precise ogle data exclude variations at those levels for both stars ; @xmath25 and @xmath26  data for vfts  003 , 424 , 458 , and 739 between hjd 2,453,000 and 2,455,000 show only a few points deviating by the order of 0.1  mag .",
    "( vfts  533 was not reported . )",
    "thus , we do not find lbv - like variability in light among the available data for these stars .",
    "it is well known that the relatively rare giant eruptions of lbvs ( as opposed to their more modest `` outbursts '' or photospheric expansions ) eject nitrogen- and sometimes dust - rich circumstellar nebulae that may persist for thousands of years ( weis 2003 ; walborn et  al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "hence , any such nebulae associated with our objects would be relevant to their evolutionary status .",
    "accordingly , we have investigated available images from the _ hubble space telescope _ cameras .",
    "sabbi et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) have described a massive treasury program in 30  doradus using the wfc3 and acs cameras , including nir observations with the former and h@xmath1 with the latter .",
    "the h@xmath1 bandpass is 72   , which includes the adjacent [ nii ] lines .",
    "the optical image clearly shows the structured , asymmetrical ejected nebulosity associated with r143 , discovered by smith et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and further discussed by weis ( 2003 ) .",
    "the only one of our objects with a possibly associated nebulosity is vfts  458 , which appears centered in a relatively isolated , complex , asymmetrical ( bipolar ? ) structure in both the optical and @xmath27-band images ( figure  5 ) .",
    "we have further investigated this structure with two new optical spectroscopic datasets : three longslit position angles from the lco 2.5 m boller & chivens cassegrain spectrograph ( r @xmath28 ) passing through the star and bright nebular knots ; and three pointings with the eso la silla 2.2 m feros echelle spectrograph ( r  =  48,000 ) both on the star and a few arcsec n or s of it .",
    "the principal result is even more extreme complexity of the region , with multiple nebular line components varying in both velocity and relative intensity on arcsec scales , which these data are inadequate to fully characterize ; further observations ( preferably with ifus ) will be required to do so .",
    "most importantly , we have not encountered any point with an [ nii ]  @xmath186584/h@xmath1 intensity ratio greater than 10% , while ratios in the range 0.5 to 1 are typical of lbv and related circumstellar nebulae ( references in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "of course , the r143 nebula provides a cautionary note : most of the nebulosity projected near the star is ambient hii , but there are also compact knots of ejected processed material present .",
    "we note that the _ spitzer_/sage project ( meixner et  al .",
    "2006 ) found very bright [ 24 ] magnitudes of 2.42.8 for vfts  458 ; however , in view of the 6  psf at 24  @xmath29 m , further investigation is required to determine the exact source .",

    "the most prominent structures are similar between the two bands .",
    "( note vestiges of the stellar diffraction spikes in the cardinal directions of the @xmath27-band image . )",

    "2012 , fig  a.1 ) .",
    "this spectrum is very similar to that of vfts  533 , albeit with much stronger nitrogen .",

    "cygnus ob2 - 12 , b4  ia@xmath11 , as classified here from the siiii / siii ratio in the high - s / n gosss spectrogram shown in fig .  4 , which shows its marked prussian helmet h@xmath0 profile ( see also clark et  al .",

    "they may be lost in some published lbv spectrograms , especially the extensive early photographic material .",
    "hr  carinae ( hd  90177 ) is the poster child for this phenomenon in lbvs , because of both its prominence and the fact that the discussion by hutsemkers & van drom ( 1991 ) is the only previous one addressing it to our knowledge .",
    "they show the asymmetrical h@xmath0 profiles at both minimum and maximum phases of the lbv variation ( their fig .  2 ) .",

    "ag  carinae ( hd  94910 ) likely also has this kind of h@xmath0 profile at maximum in fig .  1 of hutsemkers & kohoutek ( 1988 ) , although near the limit of the data and display .",
    "r127 ( hde  269858 ) in the lmc shows the same asymmetrical h@xmath0 wings upon entering its current extended outburst in fig .  3 of stahl et al .",
    "we have discussed peculiar h@xmath0 profiles in the spectra of five luminous hypergiants or supergiants in the 30  doradus region , found in data from the vlt - flames tarantula survey .",
    "these profiles contain extremely broad wings ( total width @xmath23000  km  s@xmath3 ) , which are markedly asymmetrical , with a more extended , shallow slope shortward and a less extended , steeper slope longward . at the earlier b types a narrow , central p  cygni feature is also present ( prussian helmet profile ) , whereas at mid - b to a types only the broad wings are seen .",
    "identical profiles have been known for some time in a number of galactic hypergiants .",
    "these h@xmath0 profiles are quite different from those of h@xmath1 in the same spectra , which have more symmetrical emission wings except for a broad absorption depression in the shortward one .    most importantly , we have proposed explanations of these peculiar , discrepant balmer profiles in terms of broad diffuse interstellar bands curtailing the longward wing of h@xmath0 and depressing the shortward one of h@xmath1 .",
    "further , we have drawn attention to similar h@xmath0 profiles in a number of both active and quiescent luminous blue variables or candidates thereto . in figure  6 , the locations in a theoretical hertzsprung - russell diagram of several hypergiants / supergiants with such profiles , including those discussed here , are shown in comparison with some lbvs . note that the objects below the humphreys - davidson ( hd ) limit may be returning from the red supergiant region .",
    "it is reasonable to hypothesize that the hyper / supergiants may be approaching the lbv state for the first time , which would be of considerable interest to the understanding of late massive stellar evolution if substantiated by further investigation .",
    "in fact , cyg  ob2 - 12 lies beyond the hd limit on the assumption of association membership , which may be consistent with the presence of very massive o  stars ( wright et  al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .",
    "we note that our vfts and related galactic objects are unlikely to already be quiescent or post - lbvs , because established members of those categories have additional spectral peculiarities such as feii and [ feii ] emission lines , whereas the only peculiarities in these spectra are the broad balmer wings .",

    "<S> extremely broad emission wings at h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 have been found in vfts data for five very luminous ba supergiants in or near 30  doradus in the large magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles of both lines are extremely asymmetrical , which we have found to be caused by very broad diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) in the longward wing of h@xmath0 and the shortward wing of h@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these dibs are well known to interstellar but not to many stellar specialists , so that the asymmetries may be mistaken for intrinsic features . </S>",
    "<S> the broad emission wings are generally ascribed to electron scattering , although we note difficulties for that interpretation in some objects . </S>",
    "<S> such profiles are known in some galactic hyper / supergiants and are also seen in both active and quiescent luminous blue variables . </S>",
    "<S> no prior or current lbv activity is known in these 30  dor stars , although a generic relationship to lbvs is not excluded ; subject to further observational and theoretical investigation , it is possible that these very luminous supergiants are approaching the lbv stage for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> their locations in the hrd and presumed evolutionary tracks are consistent with that possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the available evidence for spectroscopic variations of these objects is reviewed , while recent photometric monitoring does not reveal variability . a search for circumstellar nebulae has been conducted , with an indeterminate result for one of them . </S>"
