    "despite of the fact that the top quark is the heaviest known particle , with a mass comparable to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , its dynamical behavior is rather restrictive .",
    "for instance , its lifetime is so short that it decays before hadronizing , almost exclusively , into the @xmath15 mode .",
    "in fact , even though the nondiagonal @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays have sizable branching ratios , they play a quite marginal role compared with the @xmath18 channel .",
    "for instance , the @xmath17 decay has a branching ratio of order of @xmath19 .",
    "rare three - body decays generated at the tree level , as @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath1 ) are also severely restricted due to phase space limitations and thus they strongly depend on the precise value of the top mass  @xcite . at the one - loop level , the interesting flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are induced , but they have undetectable branching ratios ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26  @xcite . these peculiarities , along with diverse theoretical considerations , suggest that the top quark could be very sensitive to new physics effects , which may manifest themselves through anomalous rates for the top quark production and decay modes . although some properties of the top quark have already been examined at the tevatron  @xcite , a further scrutiny is expected at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which will operate as a veritable top quark factory , producing about ten millions of @xmath27 events per year in its first stage , and hopeful up to about eighteen millions in subsequent years  @xcite .",
    "some complementary studies will be realized at @xmath28 linear colliders  @xcite .",
    "once operating , many rare processes , involving this particle , are expected to be accessible .",
    "it is thus worth investigating some rare top quark decays that are very suppressed within the standard model ( sm ) , as they could constitute windows through which new physics effects may show up .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the investigation of possible new sources of flavor violation both in the quark and the lepton sectors , through the double flavor violating top quark decay @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 .",
    "] , that could affect the sm top dilepton signatures by adding extra leptons or by producing an asymmetry in the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 jets final states . apart from its intrinsic interest , our motivation to study",
    "this rare process was trigered from some top quark analysis published , by the cdf collaboration  @xcite which revealed some level of asymmetry in the number of @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath38 @xmath37 jets events , coming from @xmath39 di - lepton searches , that may be interpreted in terms of such types of rare top quark decays .",
    "this decay is very suppressed within the sm , as it occurs at order @xmath40 through a complicated sequence of subprocesses , namely , @xmath41 .",
    "we will focus on extended yukawa sectors that are always present within the sm with additional @xmath42-higgs multiplets or in larger gauge groups .",
    "some processes naturally associated with flavor violation or cp violation could be significantly impacted by yukawa sectors associated with multi - higgs models , as it is expected that more complicated higgs sectors tend to favor this class of new physics effects .",
    "we will assume that the double flavor violating decay @xmath43 is mediated by a virtual scalar field with a mass of the order of the fermi scale @xmath44 gev .",
    "however , instead of tackling the problem in a specific model , we will adopt a model independent approach by using the effective lagrangian technique  @xcite , which is an appropriate scheme to study those processes that are suppressed or forbidden in the sm . as it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is not necessary to introduce new degrees of freedom in order to generate flavor violation at the level of classical action , the introduction of operators of dimension higher than four will be enough .",
    "we will see below that an effective yukawa sector that incorporates @xmath2-invariants of up to dimension six is enough to reproduce , in a model independent manner , the main features that are common to extended yukawa sectors , such as the presence of both flavor violation and cp violation .",
    "although theories beyond the sm require more complicated higgs sectors that include new physical scalars , we stress that our approach for studying the @xmath43 decay mediated by a relatively light scalar particle is sufficiently general to incorporate the most relevant aspects of extended theories , as in most cases , it is always possible to identify in an appropriate limit a sm - like higgs boson whose couplings to pairs of @xmath45 and @xmath46 bosons coincide with those given in the minimal sm . besides its model independence , our framework has the advantage that it involves an equal or even less number of unknown parameters than those usually appearing in specific extended yukawa sectors .",
    "one important ingredient of our study consists in supporting our predictions , as much as possible , in the available experimental data .",
    "for this purpose , in order to predict the branching ratio of the @xmath47 decay , we will use the current low - energy data to get bounds on the flavor violating @xmath48 and @xmath6 couplings . as we will see below ,",
    "the best constraint on the @xmath48 coupling arises from the recently observed @xmath49 mixing  @xcite , although the experimental uncertainty on the proton dipole moment provides a lightly lower bound . as to the @xmath6 coupling",
    ", we will see that the best bound arises from the experimental uncertainty on the muon magnetic dipole moment .",
    "a less stringent bound for the @xmath50 coupling is derived from the experimental limit on the branching ratio of the @xmath51 decay .",
    "we will present explicit expressions that can eventually be used for bounding the parameters of any specific model .",
    "our expression for the branching ratio of the @xmath43 decay is also of general applicability , as it may be adapted easily to any specific model .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows . in section  [ y ]",
    "the gauge structure of an effective yukawa sector that include up to dimension - six @xmath2-invariant operators is discussed .",
    "section  [ d ] is devoted to calculate the branching ratio for the @xmath43 decay . in section",
    "[ b ] a comprehensive analysis concerning the impact of the effective yukawa sector on low - energy observables is carry out in order to determine the best constraints for the @xmath48 and @xmath6 flavor violating couplings . section  [ r ] is reserved to present results and analyze the experimental perspectives . finally , in section  [ c ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "in the sm the yukawa sector is both flavor - conserving and cp - conserving , but these effects can be generated at the tree level if new scalar fields are introduced .",
    "one alternative , which does not contemplate the introduction of new degrees of freedom , consists in incorporating into the classical action the virtual effects of the heavy degrees by introducing @xmath52-invariant operators of dimension higher than four  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is only necessary to extend the yukawa sector with dimension - six operators to induce the most general coupling of the higgs boson to quarks and leptons .",
    "a yukawa sector with these features has the following structure  @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 stand for the usual components of the yukawa matrix , the left - handed lepton doublet , the left - handed quark doublet , the higgs doublet , the right - handed charged lepton singlet , and the right - handed quark singlets of down and up type , respectively .",
    "the @xmath61 numbers are the components of a @xmath62 general matrix , which parametrize the details of the underlying physics , whereas @xmath63 is the typical scale of these new physics effects .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , this extended yukawa sector can be diagonalized as usual via the unitary matrices @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which correlate gauge states to mass eigenstates . in the unitary gauge",
    ", the diagonalized lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath66 where the @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are the diagonal mass matrix and @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are vectors in the flavor space . in addition , @xmath72 are matrices defined in the flavor space through the relation : @xmath73 to generate higgs - mediated fcnc effects at the level of classical action , it is assumed that neither @xmath74 nor @xmath75 are diagonalized by the @xmath76 rotation matrices , which should only diagonalize the sum @xmath77 . as a consequence , mass and interactions terms",
    "would not be simultaneously diagonalized as it occurs in the dimension - four theory .",
    "in addition , if @xmath78 , the higgs boson couples to fermions through both scalar and pseudoscalar components , which in turn could lead to cp violation in some processes . as a consequence ,",
    "the flavor violating coupling @xmath79 , with @xmath80 stands for a charged lepton  @xcite or quark , has the most general renormalizable structure of scalar and pseudoscalar type given by   can also be induced by @xmath81 operators , with @xmath82 the electroweak covariant derivative and @xmath83 and @xmath80 stand for doublet and singlet , respectively .",
    "however , they would have a marginal role in flavor physics , as this class of operators only may be generated at the one - loop level by the fundamental theory and are thus suppressed with respect to the yukawa type ones , which can be generated at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these operators induce also the @xmath84 coupling , allowing us to constraint it through @xmath46 physics data  @xcite . ] : @xmath85.\\ ] ]    to close this section , let us to emphasize that the above effective lagrangian describes the most general renormalizable coupling of scalar field to pairs of fermions , which reproduces the main features of most of the extended yukawa sectors .",
    "it includes the most general version of the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm - iii )  @xcite and multi - higgs models that comprise additional multiplets of @xmath2 or scalar representations of larger gauge groups .",
    "our approach also cover more exotic formulations of flavor violation , as the so - called familons models  @xcite or theories that involves an abelian flavor symmetry  @xcite . in this way",
    ", our results will be applicable to a wide variety of models that predict scalar - mediated flavor violation .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the branching ratio for the @xmath43 decay using the general couplings for @xmath5 and @xmath6 given in the previous section .",
    "this decay occurs through the diagram shown in figure  [ td ] .",
    "the amplitude can be written as the product of the amplitudes associated with the subprocesses @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the invariant mass of the final state @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the total higgs decay width . once squared the amplitude , averaging over the top spin states , and introducing a factor of @xmath92 to take into account the two final states @xmath93 and @xmath94 , one obtains @xmath95 where we have introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . in addition , the squared subamplitudes are given by @xmath99 from now on , the masses @xmath100 and @xmath101 will be ignored with respect to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , in phase space manipulations . in this approach , the branching ratio for this decay can be written as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the top total decay width and @xmath106 this integral has analytical solution , which is given by @xmath107    in order to make predictions , we need to use some values for the @xmath108 and @xmath109 parameters .",
