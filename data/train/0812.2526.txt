    "@xmath0(1405 ) , the lowest negative - parity baryon in spite of its non - zero strangeness , has been investigated for a long time . recently , a few works to describe @xmath0(1405 ) as a baryon - meson resonance have been reported @xcite .",
    "this picture is interesting because coupling to the mesons is surely important for this broad resonance .",
    "also , it gives new lights on the properties of the @xmath2-nuclei @xcite .",
    "one of such works is the chiral unitary approach , which employs the lowest - order baryon - meson vertices of the nonlinear chiral lagrangian as the baryon - meson interaction in the model@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of this approach is an flavor - su(3 ) extended version ; the baryon - meson interaction is a flavor - flavor type . in such a case ,",
    "the flavor - singlet state gains a strong attraction .",
    "this attraction , especially the one in the n@xmath2 channel , plays a major role to produce the @xmath0(1405 ) resonance .",
    "recently , it is argued that there is no need to include an extra pole to reproduce the @xmath0(1405 ) peak and the low - energy @xmath2n scattering data when one employs the chiral unitary approach @xcite .",
    "namely , the observables can be explained within this baryon - meson framework without introducing a pole which is not originated from the baryon - meson interaction . as we will discuss later , the mechanism is as follows .",
    "due to the strong attraction in the n@xmath2 channel , there is a n@xmath2 bound state in this framework .",
    "when the n@xmath2-@xmath4 coupling is switched on , this bound state becomes a resonance .",
    "while the baryon - meson potential in the @xmath4 channel is more attractive than that of n@xmath2 in this approach , the former channel is not affected much by this attraction .",
    "it is because the pion can not stay at the short distance , where the attraction exists , due to its light mass .",
    "thus the short - range part of the resonance wave function is mostly n@xmath2 s , and the resonance stays just below the n@xmath2 threshold .",
    "in contrast to this @xmath0(1405 ) case , it seems necessary to include an extra pole to produce n(1535 ) in the chiral unitary approach @xcite .",
    "it is probably reflecting the fact that the closest attractive channel is @xmath5k , which is by 150 mev above the n(1535 ) peak .",
    "thus , the mechanism which works well for @xmath0(1405 ) does not work for n(1535 ) .",
    "the above situation , however , raises a new question .",
    "the ground state baryons are described quite nicely by the three - quark ( q@xmath6 ) states in the constituent quark model .",
    "if one extends this idea to the negative parity baryons , there should be a flavor - singlet orbitally - excited q@xmath6 state near @xmath0(1405 ) @xcite .",
    "this state is supposed to be seen as another peak associated with the same quantum number , or , at least , affects the baryon - meson scattering largely .",
    "thus , introducing such a pole will destroy the above baryon - meson picture for @xmath0(1405 ) .",
    "the theoretical reason why an extra pole should be introduced into n(1535 ) but not into @xmath0(1405 ) is not clear yet .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that no large n@xmath2 attraction appears if one construct the baryon - meson interaction from the gluonic interaction between quarks in the quark model .",
    "it is , however , possible to reproduce the @xmath0(1405 ) resonance successfully .",
    "there , the flavor - singlet q@xmath6 state plays an important role to reproduce the peak @xcite .",
    "thus , there are still ambiguities in choosing the baryon - meson interaction .    in this paper , we compare the models and clarify the mechanism to form the @xmath0(1405 ) peak . for this purpose",
    ", we solve the lippmann - schwinger equation with semirelativistic kinematics in the momentum space .",
    "we take following two baryon - meson interactions , which have different channel dependence from each other : one is the flavor - flavor type interaction ( ff - type ) and the other is that obtained from the color - magnetic interaction ( cmi ) of the quark model ( cmi - type ) .",
    "the orbital part of the interaction we employ here is a simple separable one with the gaussian form factor for all the cases for the sake of simplicity . by removing the difference in the orbital part",
    ", we can concentrate on the effects from the channel dependence and the strength of the interactions .",
    "in addition to the above usual baryon - meson channels , we also introduce a ` bound state embedded in the continuum ' ( bsec ) . here",
    "we consider that this bsec corresponds to the flavor - singlet q@xmath6 state predicted by quark models . as for the transition potential from the baryon - meson system to the negative parity baryon",
    ", we employ the constituent quark model to analyze the structure of the vertex b(@xmath7)b(@xmath8)m(@xmath9 ) .",
    "since this bsec is flavor - singlet , for the ff - type model , the transition potential from a baryon - meson channel is proportional to the size of the flavor - singlet component in that channel . as for the cmi - type",
    ", we use the one which comes from the pair - annihilation diagram with the one - gluon exchange in the quark model @xcite . by adjusting the gaussian cut - off parameter and the size of the bsec coupling",
    ", we fit the resonance energy .",
    "note that , since the quark degrees of freedom are not taken into account directly , our calculation with the cmi - type interaction differs from the original quark - model calculation .",
    "nevertheless we use this simplified calculation to discuss the quark picture because the quark pauli - blocking effects are small in this channel .",
    "in such a case , it has been found that the results from the quark model can be expressed approximately by an energy - independent baryon - meson interaction @xcite .",
    "in fact , the obtained results in the present work are similar to the original ones .",
    "we also would like to mention that using the cmi - type interaction in this way has an advantage : the system can be treated semirelativistically , which is difficult within the usual quark - cluster - model framework .    as we will show later , it is found that the chiral unitary approach is not a unique way to produce the @xmath0(1405 ) resonance . with help of bsec , a weaker ff - type interaction or the cmi - type interaction",
    "can also give an appropriate peak .",
    "to clarify the difference of their mechanisms , we investigate the relative importance of roles of bsec and of the baryon - meson attractions . to see this",
    ", we calculate the probability of the bsec at the resonance energy and compare that with the probabilities of the baryon - meson states of the closed channels . the wave function in the coordinate space , which we use to calculate the baryon - meson probabilities ,",
    "is obtained by the fourier transformation from the off - shell t - matrix .",
    "resent experiments have discovered many hadron resonances which may have multiquark components @xcite . the present method to handle a bsec and scattering states simultaneously",
    "may be applied to various such exotic systems .    in the next section",
    ", we explain the su(3 ) structure of the baryon - meson system and the baryon - meson interactions .",
    "then , in section ii b , we explain how to solve the scattering problem with a bsec in the coupled channel baryon - meson scattering problems .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation is solved in the momentum space with the semirelativistic approach .",
    "the resonance wave function in the coordinate space is derived in section ii c. in section iii , we show the obtained phase shifts and the mass spectrum of the @xmath1 channel as well as the resonance wave functions .",
    "discussion on the difference of the mechanisms to reproduce @xmath0(1405 ) among the above models is also given .",
    "summary is given in section iv .",
    "the flavor - octet baryon and meson system can be classified into six representations : @xmath10 the strangeness=@xmath11 and isospin @xmath12 state appears in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 states .",
    "these four states are given by a linear combination of the following four baryon - meson systems : @xmath17 .",
    "since the threshold energy is much higher , the @xmath18k channel does not affect the @xmath0(1405 ) peak much as we will show later .",
    "the hamiltonian is divided into the baryon - meson space ( the @xmath19-space ) and the q@xmath6 pole space ( the @xmath20-space ) : @xmath21 and the wave function is given by @xmath22    now we explain the interactions between baryon and meson , @xmath23 , and the coupling of the baryon - meson state with the bsec such as the q@xmath6 state , @xmath24 .",
    "the potential between baryon and meson is assumed to be a central separable potential .",
    "the one between the @xmath25-th and @xmath26-th baryon - meson channels is defined by @xmath27y_{00}(\\omega_p)y_{00}(\\omega_{p ' } ) = c_{ij } { v_0\\over 8}u   \\exp [ -\\frac{1}{4}{a^2}(p^2+p'^2 ) ] .\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are strength and range of the potential .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is taken to be 1 for an energy - independent potential while for an ` energy - dependent ' potential @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are meson mass and initial momentum , respectively .",
    "this factor is introduced to take the energy dependence like the wt term into account .    note that the potential acts only on the s - wave baryon - meson states . for the ff type , the factor @xmath34 is taken to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are su(3 ) flavor generators for baryon and meson . in the cm type ,",
    "@xmath34 s are given by the color - magnetic interaction with the the quark exchanges .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath34 for both of the cases for strangeness=@xmath11 and isospin @xmath38=0 are shown in tables i and ii .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first parameter set in table iv is energy - dependent ff - type without bsec , which we call oset - type .",
    "the strength of the ff - type potential roughly corresponds to the one given by the chiral unitary model as @xmath39 which is about 2.7 [ mev fm@xmath6 ] .",
    "here we have used @xmath41 where the pion decay constant is @xmath42=93 mev @xcite .",
    "we have fixed this value for other calculations of the ff - type potential as seen in the table iv .",
    "we employ the gaussian form factor which corresponds to a size of the baryon in the quark model while a sharp cut - off for the integral of the off - shell momentum is employed in ref .  @xcite . in spite of a difference between these treatments ,",
    "the results of this parameter set is very much alike to those in ref.@xcite .    in fig .  1",
    ", we show the results of the calculation with the three channels , @xmath4 , n@xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order to see the effect of the @xmath43k channel , we have also carried out the four - channel calculation . as seen in the figure , the effect of the @xmath18k channel is small and we consider only three - channel calculation in the following .",
    "the wave functions around the resonance region , where the relative momentum of the @xmath1 channel is @xmath44 are also shown in the figures .",

    ", we have performed a similar calculation with an energy - independent potential ( parameter ( 2 ) in table iv ) .",
    "since the attraction between baryon and meson without the energy dependence becomes slightly weaker , we used a smaller range for the form factor in order to obtain a resonance around the same energy .",
    "as seen in fig .  2 , the shape of the mass spectrum becomes narrower and the n@xmath2 component of the wave function is larger in the short range .",
    "both of the cases , however , reproduce a resonance just below the n@xmath2 threshold .",
    "the observed scattering length for the n@xmath2 @xmath12 channel is negative .",
    "since the ff - type interaction is strongly attractive in this channel , the resonance should come largely from the n@xmath2 bound state in order to give a negative scattering length . in fact , the calculated scattering length is negative .",
    "it , however , seems somewhat larger in the amplitude than the observed one .",
    "this suggests that the attraction should be decreased without changing the resonance energy somehow .",
    "when a slightly long - range form factor is employed , the interaction becomes weaker .",
    "we take @xmath45 fm , which corresponds to the size parameter @xmath46 fm in the quark model , with the same strength @xmath28 as before ( parameter ( 3 ) in table iv ) .",
    "then , it becomes difficult to reproduce the resonance of @xmath0(1405 ) as seen in fig .",

    "in addition to the three baryon - meson channels , we include the flavor - singlet @xmath19-wave q@xmath6 state as a bsec state .",
    "we employ 200mev above the @xmath4 threshold as the mass of the @xmath48 state before the coupling is switched on .",
    "it corresponds to 1531mev and is slightly heavier than the mass of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we take this value because @xmath49 is considered to be the flavor - singlet spin partner .",
    "the coupling to the baryon - meson systems is much smaller here as indicated by its small width ( 15.6@xmath511.0 mev@xcite ) ; the unperturbed mass for @xmath49 is considered to be close to the observed mass .",
    "judging from the mass spectrum of the flavor - octet excited baryons , the spin - orbit force is probably small also for the flavor - singlet baryons .",
    "thus , we choose 1531 mev as the unperturbed q@xmath6 mass for @xmath0(1405 ) .    in fig .  4 ,",
    "the mass spectrum and wave functions with the parameter set ( 4 ) are shown .",
    "here we have employed the coupling with the bsec which has @xmath47 dependence , namely , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( called @xmath47-type ) in eq .",

    "the mass spectrum is similar to the one in fig .  2 , which employs the shorter range form factor without the q@xmath6 state .",
    "in order to see the effect of the energy dependence , we also show the results using the same parameters as ( 4 ) but with the energy dependence in fig .  5 .",
    "as seen in the figure , the energy dependence gives a stronger shift of the resonance and wider shape than the one without the energy dependence .",
    "this is because the strength of the potential increases around the resonance .    in fig .  6",
    ", we show the results of the parameter set ( 5 ) , which employs the different structure of the transition potential @xmath56 , namely , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( called 1-type ) in eq .  ( [ vpq ] ) .",
    "as seen in the figure , the mass spectrum is similar to the one of the case ( 1 ) .",
    "it gives a smaller scattering length than that of the case ( 1 ) , but gives a wide shape of the mass spectrum .",
    "the self energy of the q@xmath6 state is @xmath59 mev .    in all the above cases with a bsec",
    ", we successfully produce a resonance with a large width around at 1405mev . here the attraction in the n@xmath2 channel plays an important role to reproduce the resonance together with the q@xmath6 state .",
    "the n@xmath2 scattering length becomes smaller reflecting the fact that the n@xmath2 attraction decreases .",
    "introducing the q@xmath6 state keeps the resonance energy at the appropriate place . for the parameter set ( 5 ) , which reproduces the observed n@xmath2 scattering length ,",
    "the probability of the bsec is roughly half of that of n@xmath2 at the resonance .",
    "so far , we have employed the ff - type potential for the potential @xmath60 , whose characteristic feature is the strong attractive n@xmath2 potential . in the quark cluster model , however , the channel dependence of the potential @xmath60 is different from the ff - type potential . for the parameter sets ( 6)-(8 ) , we employ the cmi - type potential shown in table ii , which is derived from the color magnetic interaction with the quark exchange between q@xmath6 baryon and q@xmath61 meson .",
    "the strength of the cmi - type interaction is adjusted to reproduce the results of the quark cluster model .",
    "other parameters , such as @xmath29 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the transfer potential , are fixed to the values of the quark cluster model @xcite .",
    "first we use the non - relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation in order to reproduce the results given in @xcite .",
    "the potential parameters are ( 6 ) in table iv and the results are shown in table v and fig .",
    "the unperturbed mass of the q@xmath6 state is taken to be 160 mev above the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "it corresponds to 1491 mev , following the value calculated by the q@xmath6 quark model @xcite . as seen in the tables and figures",
    ", we can reproduce the results without carrying out the complicated quark cluster model calculation .",
    "the present model is different from the original one at the point that the model does not include the quark degrees of freedom directly .",
    "our results , however , are almost the same as the original one .",
    "it is because the relevant channels are not affected from the quark pauli - blocking effect largely@xcite .",
    "approximation by an energy - independent baryon - meson potential is valid for @xmath0(1405 ) .",
    "while the quark cluster model calculation is limited within the non - relativistic kinematics , the present approach has an advantage to employ the semirelativistic lippmann - schwinger equation . employing the cmi - type for the baryon meson potential @xmath60 , we perform the three - channel coupled @xmath1 scattering with the semirelativistic kinematics .",
    "we use again the two types of the coupling potential @xmath56 with the q@xmath6 state , namely , the 1-type and the @xmath47-type , which correspond to the parameter sets ( 7 ) and ( 8) , respectively . as seen in fig .  8",
    ", we can reproduce the resonance with a reasonable width using the 1-type coupling . on the other hand",
    ", the mass spectrum becomes very narrow when the @xmath47-type coupling is employed ( fig .",
    "this is because the coupling with the scattering states which have large @xmath64 strongly pushes the bsec downwards , but the decay probability is suppressed due to the @xmath47 dependence .",
    "the difference in the types of the transfer potentials can be clearly seen in the imaginary part of the self energy shown in table vi .",
    "those with the @xmath47-type transfer potential , parameter sets ( 4 ) and ( 8) , give much smaller values .",
    "this tendency is also seen in the table v ; these parameter sets give a narrower peak and smaller imaginary part for the n@xmath2 scattering length .",

    "this is consistent with the larger q@xmath6 contribution as seen in table iv .",
    "it seems that the n@xmath2 interaction should be more attractive than the one from the cmi - type , which may be supplied by introducing _",

    "the ff - type baryon - meson interaction with the 1-type transfer potential with the semirelativistic kinematics , the parameter set ( 5 ) in table iv , seems most appropriate . as far as @xmath0(1405 ) is concerned , the flavor - singlet q@xmath6 state is not a contradictory idea to the ff - type baryon - meson interaction .",
    "to proceed this idea , however , one has to consider what this bsec really stands for .",
    "the ff - type interaction appears between the baryon and the meson when one assumes the @xmath65-meson exchange between quarks .",
    "but , the ff - type interaction by itself can not reproduce the observed baryon or meson spectra .",

    "this probably shows an additional attractive force between n@xmath2 should be introduced into the quark model treatment .",
    "introducing such an extra attraction is usually done to produce a realistic two - baryon potential in the quark cluster model .",
    "it may comes from the @xmath66-meson exchange or other long - range effects .",
    "with such an attraction , the cmi - type may give correct low energy scattering data .",
    "we have studied the @xmath67 as a resonance in a coupled channel baryon - meson ( @xmath1-n@xmath2-@xmath3 ) scattering .",

    "the system is investigated by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with semirelativistic kinematics in the momentum space .",
    "when the ff - type interaction is strong enough , the @xmath0(1405 ) peak is reproduced without introducing a bsec like the chiral unitary approach . when the ff - type interaction is weakened by increasing the range of the form factor , or",
    "when the cmi - type interaction is employed , we have to introduce the bsec , namely , the q@xmath6 state to reproduce the observed peak .",
    "the obtained mass spectra are similar to each other .",
    "one can not distinguish the interactions and models well by the shape of the @xmath0(1405 ) peak alone .",
    "thus we have also investigated the relative importance of the coupling with the n@xmath2 channel and the q@xmath6 state by comparing the probabilities of the n@xmath2 and the bsec components at the resonance .",
    "the n@xmath2 scattering length is another clue to find the mechanism to form the resonance .    from the results of our present calculations ,",
    "the followings become clarified .",

    "the large width suggests that the baryon - meson potential should be energy - dependent or that the transfer potential between the baryon - meson system and the bsec does not vanish at the zero - momentum transfer .",
    "the semirelativistic kinematics tends to give a broader peak .",
    "the n@xmath2 scattering length suggests that the probability of the q@xmath6 state is about half of that of the n@xmath2 channel at the resonance .    in our calculation",
    ", the strong ff - type interaction without a bsec can give an appropriate peak , but scattering length is somewhat large . a weaker ff - type interaction with the q@xmath6 state",

    "one the other hand , the semirelativistic cmi - type interaction with the q@xmath6 state reproduces the observables well except for the n@xmath2 scattering length .",

    "with such an attraction , the cmi - type may give correct low energy scattering data .",
    "to understand the situation more clearly , one has to derive the potentials microscopically from more fundamental interactions .",
    "let us emphasize again that a unified treatment for the resonances should be performed to investigate the excited hadrons .",
    "one should take into account the coupling to the quark state , or a bsec , in addition to the baryon - meson states , rather than to deal with a simple q@xmath6 state or a ordinary coupled - channel scattering problem separately .",
