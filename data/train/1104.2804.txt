    "prime numbers have attracted mathematically oriented minds .",
    "they are fountains of the interesting problems which are left unresolved to the present . as well as prime numbers , natural numbers themselves sometimes show unexpected behaviors in spite of their simple appeal . in this note",
    ", we would like to present a simple property arising from the combination of two unsolved problems in number theory ; the mersenne prime numbers and the collatz - kakutani conjecture .",
    "namely , we show that there exists an approximate linear relation between an index of the mersenne prime and its collatz - kakutani path length , both of which are defined in the next section .",
    "let us start with a brief descriptions of the mersenne primes and the collatz - kakutani conjecture@xcite .",
    "a mersenne number is a positive integer given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a positive integer , called `` index '' .",
    "a mersenne prime is a mersenne number that is prime .",
    "it has been shown that if @xmath2 is a mersenne prime , @xmath1 must be prime . however , the converse is not true .",
    "in fact , only forty - seven mersenne primes have been found up to date with the largest one given when @xmath3 .",
    "this is also the largest known prime number .",
    "there are many fundamental questions left unresolved such as whether there are infinitely many mersenne primes .",
    "the behaviors of mersenne primes are irregular and unpredictable as seen in other types of prime numbers .",
    "therefore , the recent discoveries of the mersenne primes were achieved with the help of massively distributed computers , and the effort for finding new mersenne primes has been made continuously  @xcite .",
    "the mersenne primes are known for their relationships with the perfect numbers , and they are also applied to create pseudorandom number generators  @xcite .",
    "the collatz - kakutani conjecture is also one of the unsolved problems in number theory .",
    "this conjecture is a halting problem that the following operations will stop for an arbitrary positive number .",
    "consider a positive integer @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is odd , @xmath5 is the next integer .",
    "if @xmath4 is even , @xmath6 is the next integer .",
    "if we repeat this process , it will eventually reach the halting state @xmath7 for all positive integers .",
    "for example , if we start from @xmath8 , we have a sequence as    @xmath9    this process can be visualized as the collatz - kakutani tree as shown in fig .  1a .",
    "the conjecture states that this tree covers all the positive integers .",
    "even though this conjecture is unsolved , it is generally believed as true from arguments through probability theories and through computational verifications .",
    "let us introduce the `` collatz - kakutani path length '' @xmath10 for a number of steps for @xmath4 to reach @xmath7 through the above operations , i.e. , a number of operational steps needed to reach @xmath11 ( `` the root '' ) on the collatz - kakutani tree .",
    "for example , @xmath12 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath10 is highly irregular and no simple law for the path length is found if the collatz - kakutani conjecture is false ] . as a result ,",
    "the plot of @xmath10 versus @xmath4 produces a irregular graph as shown in fig .",
    "while the general relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath10 is unknown , there are some trivial relations such as @xmath13 .",
    "note that , the number @xmath14 is just one larger than the mersenne number @xmath15 .     on the collatz - kakutani tree to the root of tree @xmath7 for integers up to x=2000 . ]",
    "our main finding to report is the fact that a path length of a mersenne prime is approximately proportional to its index for large n , namely , @xmath16 this is shown in fig .  2 , which we computed up to the largest known 47th mersenne prime , @xmath17 .",
    "the behavior of the path length @xmath18 is non ",
    "monotonic for small indices , e.g. , @xmath19 .",
    "we expect , however , beyond @xmath20 , the path length increases monotonically with @xmath1 for the mersenne primes .",
    "also , there seems no regular path to reach the root of the tree , @xmath7 .",
    "for example , we have examined the path for two nearby mersenne primes , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "while they both have the path length @xmath18 of approximately @xmath23 , they share the last 16 steps , namely ,    @xmath24 and @xmath11 .    the relations between indices of the mersenne primes and their path lengths are summarized in table  [ tbl_pathlength ] .    .",
    "path lengths of the mersenne primes . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < , < , < \" , ]      ( top ) and @xmath25 ( bottom ) versus @xmath1 .",
    "the mersenne primes are marked by arrows , and horizontal line is at @xmath26 .",
    "a. prime indices near @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , b. every fifth prime indices near @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , c. every fifth prime indices near @xmath31 ( @xmath32 . ]",
    "the nature and mechanism of these properties appeared in figure 4 need to be studied further .",
    "we , nevertheless , conjecture that these qualitative behavior will continue to larger mersenne numbers , and the mersenne prime appears with its @xmath33 .",
    "unfortunately , again , this is clearly not sufficient to select out the mersenne primes .",
    "if this conjecture is true , however , we can heuristically rule out points that are further away from the horizontal line of @xmath33 from candidates of the mersenne primes .",
    "we have used the collatz - kakutani tree as a provider of `` length '' for natural numbers , and obtained a conjecture for the mersenne primes .",
    "this may be yet another example where prime numbers can give rise to an emergence of unexpected order , such as ulam spiral  @xcite .",
    "though the reason behind such simple behavior is left unclear , this approach of using the collatz - kakutani tree can be extended to other types of set of numbers known for irregularities , possibly leading to interesting insights@xcite .",
