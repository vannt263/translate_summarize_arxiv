    "classical and quantum information processing network architectures utilize light ( optical photons ) for the transmission of information over extended distances , ranging from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers  @xcite .",
    "the utility of optical photons stems from their weak interaction with the environment , large bandwidth of transmission , and resiliency to thermal noise due to their high frequency ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "acoustic excitations ( phonons ) , though limited in terms of bandwidth and their ability to transmit information farther than a few millimeters , can be delayed and stored for significantly longer times and can interact resonantly with rf - microwave electronic systems  @xcite .",
    "this complimentary nature of photons and phonons suggests hybrid phononic - photonic systems as a fruitful avenue of research , where a new class of _ optomechanical _ circuitry could be made to perform a range of tasks out of reach of purely photonic and phononic systems .",
    "a building block of such a hybrid architecture would be elements coherently interfacing optical and acoustic circuits . the optomechanical translator we propose in this paper acts as a chip - scale _ transparent , coherent interface _ between phonons and photons and fulfills a key requirement in such a program .    in the quantum realm , systems involving optical , superconducting ,",
    "spin or charge qubits coupled to mechanical degrees of freedom  @xcite have been explored .",
    "the recent demonstration of coherent coupling between a superconducting qubit and a mechanical resonance by oconnell , et al .",
    "@xcite , has provided an experimental backing for this vision and is the latest testament to the versatility of mechanics as a connecting element in hybrid quantum systems . in the specific case of phonon - photon state transfer , systems involving trapped atoms , ions , nanospheres  @xcite , and mechanically compliant optical cavity structures",
    "@xcite have all been considered . in these past studies ,",
    "the state of an incoming light field is usually mapped onto the motional state of an atom , ion , or macroscopic mirror , through an exact timing of control pulses , turning on and off the interaction between the light and mechanical motion in a precise way . the ability to simultaneously implement phononic and photonic waveguides in optomechanical crystal ( omc ) structures  @xcite opens up the opportunity to implement a  _ traveling - wave _ phonon - photon translator ( ppt ) .",
    "such a device , operating continuously , connects acoustic and optical waves to each other in a symmetric manner , and allows for on - the - fly conversion between phonons and photons without having to precisely time the information and control pulses . in effect",
    ", the problem of engineering control pulses is converted into a problem of engineering coupling rates .",
    "our proposal for a ppt is motivated strongly by recent work  @xcite on radiation pressure effects in micro- and nano - scale mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the concrete realization of a ppt is aided by the considerable advances made in the last decade in the theory , design and engineering of thin - film artificial quasi-2d ( patterned membrane ) crystal structures containing photonic  @xcite and phononic  @xcite `` band gaps '' .",
    "such systems promise unprecedented control over photons and phonons , and have been separately subject to extensive investigation .",
    "their unification , in the form of omcs which possesses a simultaneous phononic and photonic bandgap  @xcite , and in which the interaction between the photons and phonons can be controlled , promises to further expand the capabilities of both photonic and phononic architectures and forms the basis of the proposed ppt implementation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sections  [ sec : outline ] and",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we introduce and study the ppt system as an abstraction , at first classically and then quantum mechanically . after introducing the basic system , its properties and its scattering matrix , we study the effects of quantum and classical noise on device operation . in section  [ sec : implementation ] we design and simulate a possible physical implementation of the system , utilizing recent results in simultaneous phononic - photonic bandgap materials  @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : applications ] , we demonstrate a few possible applications of the ppt . focusing first on `` classical '' applications , we evaluate the performance of the ppt when used for the implementation of an optical delay line and wavelength converter .",
    "finally , we show how such a system could be used in theory to do high fidelity quantum state transfer between optical and superconducting qubits .",
    "the proposed ppt system , shown in fig .  [ fig : full_system_diagram ] , consists of a localized mechanical resonance ( @xmath1 ) which couples the two optical resonances ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) of an optomechanical cavity via radiation pressure . external coupling to and from the mechanical resonance is provided by an acoustic waveguide , while each of the optical resonances are coupled to via separate optical waveguides .",
    "multi - optical - mode optomechanical systems have been proposed and experimentally studied previously in the context of enhancing quantum back - action , reduced lasing threshold , and parametric instabilities  @xcite .",
    "here we use a two - moded optical cavity as it allows for the spatial filtering and separation of signal and pump optical beams while reducing the quantum noise in the system , as is explained below .    a general description of the radiation - pressure - coupling of the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom in such a structure is as follows .",
    "for each of the two high-@xmath4 optical resonances of the cavity we associate an annihilation operator @xmath5 and a frequency @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "geometric deformation of the optomechanical cavity parameterized by @xmath8 , changes the frequencies of the optical modes by @xmath9 .",
    "the deformation , due to the localized mechanical resonance with annihilation operator @xmath10 and frequency @xmath11 , can be quantized and given by @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a coupling between the two optical cavity modes given by @xmath13 , where for resonant intermodal mechanical coupling the cavity structure must be engineered such that @xmath14 . in a traveling wave ppt device consisting of the two optical cavity resonances and a single mechanical resonance ,",
    "the lower frequency cavity mode ( @xmath2 in this case ) is used as a pump cavity which enables the inter - conversion of phonons in the mechanical resonance ( @xmath1 ) to photons in the second , higher frequency , optical cavity mode ( @xmath3 ) through a two - photon process in which pump photons are either absorbed or emitted as needed .",
    "the signals representing the phonon and photon quanta to be exchanged will thus be contained in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "as described , the hamiltonian of this system is , @xmath15    where we have added a classical optical pumping term of electric field amplitude @xmath16 and frequency @xmath17 .",
    "optical pumping is performed through one of the optical waveguides with ( field ) coupling rate to the @xmath2 cavity resonance given by @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the waveguide loading of each optical resonance ( @xmath19 ) , the total optical loss rate of each cavity mode includes an intrinsic component ( @xmath20 ) of field decay due to radiation , scattering , and absorption .",
    "similarly for the mechanical resonance , we have a field decay rate given by @xmath21 which is a combination of waveguide loading and intrinsic losses .",
    "the constant parts of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) can be eliminated by a change of basis and are thus taken to be zero . as discussed below , it is advantageous to choose a cavity structure symmetry in which @xmath26 up to linear order in @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , we can generally assume that the mechanical displacements are small enough to make the linear order the only important term in the interaction .",
    "assuming then a properly chosen cavity symmetry , @xmath28 which yields a simplified hamiltonian @xmath29    treating the system classically and approximately , we can write each intracavity photon and phonon amplitude , and their inputs ( see fig .  [ fig : doublecav_sidebands ] ) as a fourier decomposition of a few relevant sidebands : @xmath30 the equations of motion arrived at from the system hamiltonian ( presented generally in the following section ) then become algebraic relations between the @xmath31 and @xmath32 sideband amplitudes . by ignoring the self - coupling term ( @xmath33 ) , pumping on - resonance with cavity mode @xmath2 ( @xmath34 ) , and engineering the optical cavity mode splitting for mechanical resonance ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "we arrive at classical sideband amplitudes , @xmath36    from here we see that the central sideband amplitude of cavity mode @xmath2 , @xmath37 , is proportional to the sum of a term containing the pump field @xmath38 and terms containing products of the optical and mechanical sideband amplitudes . by increasing @xmath38",
    "the effect of the other sidebands on the pump resonance amplitude can be made negligible , and we assume here and elsewhere in this work that the pump sideband is generally left unaffected by the dynamics of the rest of the system . as desired the optical sideband which contains mechanical information",
    "is @xmath39 since it is the only sideband directly proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the constant of proportionality between these two terms is seen to contain both @xmath41 and @xmath37 , demonstrating the role of the pump beam in the conversion process .",
    "since coherent information transfer between the optics and mechanics is occurring between @xmath40 and @xmath39 , it is desirable to remove the effects of the lower energy photonic sideband , @xmath42 .",
    "this sideband can be made significantly smaller in magnitude than @xmath39 in the sideband - resolved regime where @xmath43 . a convenient way to visualize all of the processes in the system",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : doublecav_sidebands ] where the photonic sideband amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath37 are represented as `` energy levels '' , with transitions between them being due to the emission and absorption of phonons .    from this approximate analysis",
    "it is clearly suggested that in a sideband resolved optomechanical system , a state - transfer process is possible between the phononic and photonic resonances , and the process is controlled by a pump beam  @xcite .",
    "a more in - depth study of the system dynamics required to understand how such processes may be used for traveling wave phonon - photon conversion , and a full investigation of all relevant noise sources required to understand the applicability of such a system to quantum information , is carried out in the following section .",
    "a detailed treatment of the operation of a traveling phonon - photon translator is carried out in this section . at first , the dynamics of the system are simplified while still taking into account the noise processes related to the sideband @xmath42 . in this way one",
    "is left with an effective ` beam - splitter ' hamiltonian , which describes the coherent interaction between the optics and mechanics , while the aforementioned noise processes are accounted for through an effective increase in the thermal bath temperature .",
    "this is followed by a treatment of the traveling - wave problem through a scattering matrix formulation , which provides insight into the role of the intracavity pump photon number ( @xmath45 ) and optimizing the state transfer efficiency .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ eqn : total_hamiltonian ] ) , a set of heisenberg - langevin equations can be written down ,",
    "@xcite :    @xmath46    the input coupling terms as written above include both external waveguide coupling and intrinsic coupling due to lossy channels ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : full_system_diagram ] ) .",
    "separated , the intrinsic ( with subscript @xmath47 ) and extrinsic ( with no subscript ) components look as follows , @xmath48 as the fluctuations in the fields are of primary interest , each heisenberg operator can be rewritten as a fluctuation term around a steady - state value , @xmath49 assuming that the pump beam is driven resonantly with @xmath50 ( @xmath34 ) , the @xmath51-number steady - state values are equal to @xmath52 .    for the fluctuation dynamics , with @xmath53 , the resulting equations are :    @xmath54    ignoring all the mechanically anti - resonant terms for now , and invoking the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) valid when @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we arrive at the simplified set of fluctuation equations , @xmath57    [ ss : spont_emission ]    by ignoring all of the counter - rotating terms proportional to @xmath58 , we have also neglected the noise processes alluded to previously due to the @xmath42 sideband . of the mechanically anti - resonant terms which have been dropped ,",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in equation  ( [ eqn : hl_full_a2dot ] ) and @xmath61 in equation  ( [ eqn : hl_full_bdot ] ) ) are the largest and most significant in terms of error in the rotating wave approximation .",
    "these terms correspond to @xmath62 + h.c . in the hamiltonian and cause inter - sideband photon scattering between the pump , @xmath37 , and its lower frequency sideband , @xmath42 as shown in figure  [ fig : doublecav_sidebands ] .",
    "this inter - sideband scattering process causes emission and absorption of phonons in the mechanical part of the ppt , thus in principle , even when the extrinsic phonon inputs are in the vacuum state , spontaneous scattering of photons from @xmath37 to @xmath42 may populate the mechanical cavity with a phonon .",
    "this effect was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the context of quantum limits to optomechanical cooling .",
    "similar to that work , a master equation for the phononic mode with the @xmath63 optical sideband adiabatically eliminated results in an additional _ phononic _ spontaneous emission term given by , @xmath64 where @xmath65 . the master equation for the mechanics , found by tracing over all bath and optical variables , is of the form @xmath66 $ ] , where the terms on the right hand side of the equation are respectively the intrinsic phononic loss , the phonon spontaneous emission , the phonon - waveguide coupling , and the coherent evolution of the system .",
    "the first two terms can be lumped together into an effective intrinsic loss , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and n _ .",
    "hence , by assuming that the intrinsic loss phonon bath is at a modified temperature with occupation number @xmath69 , and changing the intrinsic phonon loss rate to @xmath70 , the spontaneous emission and intrinsic loss noise are lumped into one effective thermal noise liouvillian for the mechanics .",
    "note that it is possible in this model to have @xmath70 negative when @xmath71 ; however , the motional decoherence rate is always positive and given by @xmath72 . in section  [ ss : scattering_matrix ] we will see that the optimal state transfer efficiency is given by @xmath73 in this case is in principle @xmath74 as opposed to @xmath75 , and the equations must therefore be solved self - consistently .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ ss : spont_mod ] . ]",
    "in which case@xmath76 in the sideband resolved limit . in the case",
    "where @xmath77 ( recall this is the self - coupling radiation pressure term ) , photons scattering from the pump into the lower frequency sideband ( @xmath78 ) can scatter into the @xmath50 cavity mode which is only detuned by @xmath11 .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath33 case considered thus far in which the detuning is @xmath79 for scattering into the @xmath80 mode . as such , for the @xmath77 case there will be roughly four times the spontaneous emission noise , with @xmath81 .",
    "a final simplification can be made by neglecting the fluctuations in the strong optical pump of cavity mode @xmath50 .",
    "considering that the fluctuations in the variables are all of the same order , and that @xmath82 always appears as @xmath83 in the equations of motion for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , we can ignore the dynamics of the pump fluctuations in the case where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this is the undepleted pump approximation .",
    "adiabatically removing the pump from the dynamics of the system yields a pump - enhanced optomechanical coupling @xmath88 between optical cavity mode @xmath80 and the mechanical resonance @xmath1 .",
    "dropping the subscript from the cavity mode @xmath80 and moving to a rotating reference frame results in the new effective hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath89 the system diagram and symbol corresponding to this simplified model of the ppt are shown in figure  [ fig : simplified_system_diagram ] .      to understand the properties of the ppt as a waveguide adapter , we begin with a study of its scattering matrix . starting from the effective hamiltonian given in equation  ( [ eqn : h_eff_start ] ) ,",
    "the heisenberg - langevin equations of motion for the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : h_eff_start ] ) are written under a markov approximation in the frequency domain , @xmath90 the intrinsic noise terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the initial - state boson annihilation operators for the baths , while the extrinsic terms @xmath93 and @xmath94 are annihilation operators for the optical and mechanical guided modes for each respective waveguide . since the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqn : h_eff_start ] ) has been used to derive equations ( [ eqn : freqdom1]-[eqn : freqdom2 ] ) , thus neglecting the counter - rotating terms present in the full system dynamics , the effects of phonon spontaneous emission noise is included separately . following the discussion in section  [ ss : spont_emission ] ,",
    "the effective liouvillian  ( [ eqn : effective_louivillian ] ) corresponds to replacing @xmath95 with @xmath96 in ( [ eqn : freqdom2 ] ) and using a langevin force @xmath92 satisfying the relations , @xmath97 where @xmath96 and @xmath69 are given in equations ( [ eqn : gamma_prime]-[eqn : n_prime ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic optical noise correlations are only due to vacuum fluctuations and given by @xmath98 . to ensure efficient translation , competing requirements of matching and strong coupling between waveguide and resonator must be satisfied .",
    "this is similar to the problem of designing integrated optical filters using resonators and waveguides  @xcite . from the above equations and the input - output boundary condition  @xcite",
    ", we arrive at the matrix equation , @xmath99 with scattering and noise matrices @xmath100 the elements of the scattering matrix @xmath101 are @xmath102 similar expressions are also found for the noise scattering matrix elements @xmath103 , with their extrema reported below .    in order to obtain efficient conversion",
    "the cavities must be over - coupled to their respective waveguides , ensuring that the phonon ( photon ) has a higher chance of leaking into the waveguide continuum modes than escaping into other loss channels . in this regime , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the weak coupling regime , @xmath106 ,",
    "the response of the system exhibits a maximum for @xmath107 and @xmath108 at @xmath109 and a minimum at the same point for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "is converted to a phonon at rate @xmath114 , and then back to a photon before it has a chance to leave through the much slower phononic loss channel at rate @xmath115 , causing there to be significant reflections and reduced conversion efficiency . to find the optimal value of @xmath114 we consider the extrema given by @xmath116 in the over - coupled approximation and in the case where @xmath117",
    ", it is easy to see that the full translation condition @xmath118 is achievable by setting @xmath114 equal to g^ = [ eqn : matching_condition ] .",
    "this result has a simple interpretation as a matching requirement .",
    "the photonic loss channel viewed from the phononic mode has a loss rate of @xmath119 . matching this to the purely mechanical loss rate of the same phononic mode , @xmath115 , one arrives at @xmath120 .",
    "the same argument can be used for the photonic mode , giving the same result . under this matched condition ,",

    "we have assumed resonant optical pumping of the @xmath50 cavity mode and considered several different detuning values @xmath130 .",
    "the normalized optical reflection spectrum ( @xmath131 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : scattering_matrix](a ) , in which the broad optical cavity resonance can be seen along with a deeper , narrowband resonance that tunes with @xmath130 .",
    "this narrowband resonance is highlighted in figure  [ fig : scattering_matrix](b ) , showing that the optical reflection is nearly completely eliminated on resonance .",
    "photons on resonance , instead of being reflected , are being converted into outgoing phonons as can be seen in resonance peak of @xmath132 shown in figure  [ fig : scattering_matrix](d ) .",
    "a similar reflection dip and transmission peak is visible for the phononic reflection ( @xmath111 ) and phonon to photon translation ( @xmath107 ) curves .",
    "it is also notable from figure  [ fig : scattering_matrix ] that for small detunings @xmath130 of the system ( @xmath133 ) the resonant scattering matrix elements are only weakly affected and the translation process maintains its efficiency .      as a consequence of the counter - rotating terms treated in section  [ ss : spont_emission ] , @xmath115 is weakly dependent on @xmath114 . in particular , by making the substitution @xmath134 , where @xmath96 is given by equation  ( [ eqn : gamma_prime ] ) , the equation for the optimal @xmath114 becomes @xmath135 , where @xmath96 is itself dependent on @xmath114 .",

    "the issue of waveguide loss is one that is normally ignored in quantum optical systems where low - loss fiber or free - space links are readily available . on the phononic side of the systems studied here",
    ", the length of the waveguide and its intrinsic losses may be large enough for the waveguide attenuation factor to become important . because of the negative effect of attenuation in applications involving optomechanical delay lines , and quantum state transfer , it is useful to model this loss and see how the scattering matrix elements are altered . a model of the system shown in figure  [ fig : waveguide - loss](b ) , where the lossy waveguide is replaced by a single beam splitter .",
    "this is accomplished by first modeling the lossy waveguide as a large number @xmath139 of cascaded beam splitters , each reflecting @xmath140 away from the main beam , with @xmath141 .",
    "this serial array of beam splitters can be combined into one , with reflectivity @xmath142 as @xmath143 .",
    "the relation for @xmath144 can be found by starting from the approximate scattering matrix relation for @xmath145 , @xmath146 and using the beam splitter relations , @xmath147 assuming that the phonon cavity intrinsic loss bath is at the same temperature and uncorrelated with the phonon waveguide intrinsic loss baths , then one finds for translation through the lossy phonon waveguide , @xmath148 where @xmath149 the value of @xmath108 is simply reduced by a factor @xmath150 due to the lossy waveguide . for propagation lengths short relative to the attenuation length of the lossy waveguide , @xmath151 , and",
    "the reduction in translation @xmath152 is small . the added noise due to the waveguide attenuation is contained in @xmath153 , and is also seen to be small for @xmath151 .",
    "in general , the type of noise which is relevant to the ppt depends on the conditions in which it is used .",
    "for example , when used as a bridge between rf - microwave photonics and optics for classical applications at room temperature , the thermal noise affecting the rf signal will be at a level which makes the quantum noise induced by spontaneous pump scattering irrelevant .",
    "on the other hand , when the system is used at cryogenic temperatures for connecting a superconducting circuit qed system to an optical system as described below , the quantum noise of the translation process itself becomes dominant . in what follows we analyze both sources of noise .",

    "@xmath165 is the standard thermal noise input on the phononic side of the ppt .",
    "the ratio @xmath166 is a translation factor , arising from the fact that quantum - limited conversion of phonons to photons causes an increase in energy by the factor of the ratio of their frequencies . finally , the factor @xmath167 is the extraction efficiency of photons from the optical mode to the waveguide .",
    "alternatively , one may define an equivalent optical temperature by setting @xmath168 , yielding @xmath169 , where the @xmath4 s represent the loaded quality factors of the optical and mechanical resonators .",
    "this last expression must be interpreted carefully , only in terms of a power equivalence , as spectrally the noise on the optical side of the ppt has a bandwidth of @xmath170 , while thermal noise radiating from the cavity would have a bandwidth of @xmath171 .      to calculate the effective increase in noise brought about by the spontaneous pump scattering and phonon emission process , we start from equation  ( [ eqn : sout1 ] ) and use the spontaneous emission contribution @xmath160 to find , @xmath172 the second term in the brackets is due to the spontaneous emission of phonons by the optical pump beam , and is added to the thermal noise exiting the optical side of the ppt . put in terms of an effective contribution to the thermal _ photon",
