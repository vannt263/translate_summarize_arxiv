    "the spontaneously breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been an interesting topic for nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this broken symmetry would be restored in a medium , and several signals have recently been suggested for its manifestation in nuclear matter , such as the spectral enhancement near the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the pion mass ) threshold  @xcite , the systematic appearance of the parity doublets in the missing - states region  @xcite , and the vector manifestation  @xcite etc .",
    "it is also shown that the partial restoration of chiral symmetry has strong effects on the nuclear saturation  @xcite and the nuclear equation of state  @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant quantity to the chiral symmetry restoration is the scalar quark condensate @xmath4 .",
    "the zero value of the condensate can be strictly proven to be a necessary condition for exact chiral symmetry .",
    "but the sufficiency is not available presently .",
    "in fact , birse has shown that the pieces arising from low - momentum virtual pions should not be associated with chiral restoration  @xcite",
    ". however , more recent investigations are in favor of the hypothesis that the quark condensate is a leading order parameter  @xcite .",
    "the quark condensate in vacuum @xmath5 is indeed a vast quantity ( @xmath6 mev@xmath7 ) .",
    "however , this value will be modified in a medium . the change produced by the deuteron",
    "has recently been investigated  @xcite .",
    "there are also considerable investigations on the modification due to nuclear and/or quark matter . for more references , see relevant review articles  @xcite .",
    "it has long been speculated that strange quark matter ( sqm ) , rather than the normal nuclear matter , might be the true qcd ground state  @xcite , or absolutely stable @xcite .",
    "the critical density of sqm depends on the quark mass scaling  @xcite , while the quark mass scaling is closely linked to the quark condensate in quark matter  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of in - medium quark condensates is meaningful independently of whether it can serve as an order parameter of chiral restoration .",
    "originally , the interacting part of the quark mass was taken to be inversely proportional to density  @xcite .",
    "that parametrization has no derivation , and leads to inconsistencies in the thermodynamic properties of sqm  @xcite .",
    "later , a straightforward derivation method is provided , and the scaling is changed to be inversely proportional to the cubic root of the density  @xcite .",
    "one of the most popularly used methods to calculate the in - medium quark condensate is the feynman - helmann theorem .",
    "the main difficulty in this formalism is that one has to make assumptions on the derivatives of model parameters with respect to the quark current mass . to bypass this difficulty",
    ", we will apply a similar idea as in the study of strange quark matter by defining an equivalent mass . a differential equation which determines the equivalent mass",
    "will be derived in detail , then it is solved within a qcd - like inter - quark interaction .",
    "the normally accepted linear behavior of the condensate in nuclear matter is naturally reproduced and extended to quark matter",
    ". however , the decreasing speed of the condensate in quark matter is merely half of that in nuclear matter if the pion - nucleon sigma term is 6 times the average current mass of light quarks . at higher densities , the decreasing speed is usually slowed , compared with the linear extrapolation , due to interactions .",
    "we organize the present paper as follows .",
    "in the subsequent sec .",
    "[ qcqm ] , we describe the equivalent mass method , and apply it to the investigation of the quark condensate in quark matter . an equation to determine the equivalent mass",
    "is derived , solved analytically at lower densities , and solved numerically with a qcd - like inter - quark interaction at higher densities . to test the correctness of the equivalent mass method",
    ", we apply it to nuclear matter in sec .",
    "the model - independent linear behavior is reproduced and the higher order s contribution is studied in the mean - field level .",
    "[ dis ] is a short summary .",
    "applying the feynman - hellmann theorem , respectively , to the vacuum @xmath8  and the state @xmath9 with baryon number density @xmath10 , and then taking the difference , as has been done for nuclear matter  @xcite , one can obtain the following expression for the relative chiral condensate in quark matter : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy density of quark matter above the vacuum , @xmath13 mev is the average current mass of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks , @xmath14 is a constant related to the pion mass @xmath15 mev and the pion decay constant @xmath16 mev by @xmath17 here we have used the gellman - oakes - renner relation  @xcite @xmath18 and the notations @xmath19 for an arbitrary operator @xmath20 .    from eq .",
    "( [ qccohen ] ) , the usual procedure to calculate the in - medium quark condensate will be to find an expression for the energy density , carrying then the derivative with respect to the current quark mass .",
    "however , it is usually difficult to know the current quark mass dependence of model parameters , e.g.  meson masses , coupling constants , and cutoffs etc .",
    ", without full understanding how effective models are related to the underlying theory ( qcd ) . to bypass this difficulty ,",
    "we suggest an equivalent mass method bellow .",
    "the qcd hamiltonian density for the two - flavor case can be schematically written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kinetic term , @xmath23 is the interacting part , and @xmath24 is the average current mass of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks .",
    "terms breaking flavor symmetry have been ignored .",
    "the basic idea of the mass - density - dependent model of quark matter is that the system energy can be expressed in the same form as a proper non - interacting system .",
    "the strong interaction between quarks is included within the appropriate variation of quark masses with density . in order not to confuse with other mass concepts",
    ", we refer to such a density - dependent mass as an equivalent mass . therefore , if we use the equivalent mass @xmath25 , the system hamiltonian density should be replaced by an hamiltonian density of the form @xmath26 where @xmath25 is the equivalent mass to be determined .",
    "obviously , we must require that the two hamiltonian densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the same expectation value for any state @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 applying this equality to the state @xmath9with baryon number density @xmath10 and to the vacuum state @xmath8 , respectively , taking then the difference , one has @xmath31",
    "since we are considering a system with uniformly distributed particles , or in other words , the density @xmath10 has nothing to do with the space coordinates , we can write @xmath32 this equality is especially obvious if we consider it in terms of quantum mechanics : @xmath29 is a wave function with arguments @xmath10 and coordinates , the expectation value is nothing but an integration with respect to the coordinates . therefore , if @xmath10 does not depend on coordinates , the function @xmath33 is also a coordinate - independent c - number , and can naturally be taken out of the integration . however ,",
