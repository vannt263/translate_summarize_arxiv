    "a large population of obscured powerful quasars called type-2 quasars has long been predicted by the widely accepted unified model for active galactic nuclei ( agns ; antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "they are believed to be intrinsically the same as type-1 quasars but with strong obscuration in both optical and x - ray band due to the presumable torus . most of such type-2 quasars , which might dominate the black hole growth ( e.g. , martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2005 ) , have been missed by optical surveys for quasars .",
    "doubt has been expressed at times on the existence of type-2 quasars ( e.g. halpern , turner & george 1999 ) , mainly due to their rareness and the fact that they are easily mimicked by other types of agns .",
    "the hard x - ray emission is less affected by the photon - electric absorption , making hard x - ray surveys good approach to search for type-2 quasars .",
    "another advantage of x - day data is that x - ray spectral fitting can yield intrinsic luminosity and absorption simultaneously , which are both required to study the population of obscured quasars .",
    "a number of obscured quasars have been successfully revealed by recent deep and wide - area x - ray surveys performed by @xmath4 and xmm ( norman et al .",
    "2002 ; stern et al .",
    "2002 ; mainieri et al .",
    "2002 ; fiore et al .",
    "2003 ; caccianiga et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "however , many studies have claimed that the fraction of obscured quasars is much smaller than expected from the simplified agn unified model .",
    "ueda et al . ( 2003 ) computed the x - ray luminosity function for 2  10 kev selected agn samples , and found that the fraction of x - ray absorbed agns ( with @xmath3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) drops from @xmath8 0.6 at intrinsic @xmath2 around 10@xmath9 ergs s@xmath10 to around 0.3 at @xmath2 above 10@xmath11 ergs s@xmath10 .",
    "several other studies based on hard x - ray surveys also support the scheme that the fraction of type ii agns ( or x - ray absorbed agns ) decreases with intrinsic luminosity ( steffen et al .",
    "2003 ; barger et al . 2005",
    "; la franca et al . 2005 ; shinozaki et al .",
    "however , contrary results are also reported .",
    "perola et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the fraction of obscured agns in hellas2xmm does not change with x - ray luminosity , although the fraction ( 40% ) appears smaller than expected .",
    "eckart et al . ( 2006 ) found that half of the agns identified by the sexsi program are x - ray obscured with @xmath3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , and the fraction of obscured agns is independent of the unobscured luminosity .",
    "the discrepancy can be attributed to the redshift evolution in the fraction of obscured quasars ( la franca et al .",
    "2005 ; wang et al .",
    "2006 ) : while shallow and wide surveys are probing quasars in the local universe where probably only a small fraction of quasars are obscured , deep surveys are detecting quasars at much higher redshift where more than half of them are obscured ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) .    soft gamma - ray selected agn samples ( markwardt et al .",
    "2005 , hereafter m06 ; bassani et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter b06 ; beckmann , gehrels & shrader 2006 ) obtained by @xmath0 and @xmath1 provide the best opportunity to study the fraction of obscured agn in the local universe in the least biased way . note that for compton - thick cases ( n@xmath12 @xmath5 10@xmath13 @xmath7 ) , even soft gamma - ray emission could be significantly attenuated , thus soft gamma - ray selected samples are not complete to compton - thick sources .",
    "claims have been made based on the soft gamma - ray selected samples , that the fraction of obscured agns in the local universe significantly decrease with increasing luminosity . in this letter",
    "we point out that two correction have to be made to the samples to study of the fraction of obscured quasars .",
    "the corrections are : a ) radio loud agns have to be excluded since their x - ray emission might be dominated by the jet component thus the measured luminosity and the obscuration does not reflect the intrinsic values in the nuclei ; b ) compton thick sources have to be excluded too since their soft gamma ray emission are also strongly attenuated by compton scattering and their intrinsic luminosities are hard to estimate .",
    "after the corrections , we find only marginal decrease in the fraction of obscured agn with luminosity in the local universe .",
    "larger samples are required to reach a more robust conclusion .",
    "bassani et al . ( 2006 ) provides an agn sample selected in the 20  100 kev band with the ibis on @xmath1 .",
    "the sample contains 62 active galactic nuclei ( 14 of them are unclassified ) above a flux limit of @xmath14 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath10 . b06",
    "listed the available column densities ( obtained from archival x - ray spectra ) for 35 sources with redshifts . in this letter",
    "we provide an updated list of @xmath3 ( and references ) with more recent measurements available in literature ( mostly from @xmath4 or @xmath15 observations , table 1 ) . in b06 does not significantly affect out main results in this paper . ] within this subsample , 10 are radio loud ( including five blazars ) , five are compton - thick ( n@xmath16 @xmath7 ) , the rest 20 are radio quiet and compton - thin . the luminosities in the 20  100 kev band were calculated by assuming a crab - like spectrum .      the first 3 months of the @xmath0 burst alert telescope ( bat ) high galactic latitude survey provide a sample of 14  195 kev band selected sources ( m05 ) with a flux limit of @xmath8 10@xmath17 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath10 and @xmath18 ( 90% confidence ) positional uncertainties for the faintest sources .",
    "86% of the 66 high - latitude sources were identified .",
    "twelve are galactic - type sources , and 44 are identified with known agns .",
    "the luminosities in the 14  195 kev band were calculated by assuming a typical power - law spectrum ( @xmath19 ) . m05 listed the absorption column density derived from literature or archive x - ray spectra for 39 agns .",
    "we also provide an updated list of @xmath3 ( and references ) with more recent measurements available in literature ( table 1 ) .",
    "the major changes are that two more compton - thick sources ( ngc 1365 and ngc 7582 ) are classified . within the 39 sources , there are 7 radio loud sources ( including three blazars ) , 4 compton - thick sources and 28 radio quiet compton - thin seyfert galaxies .      in order to increase the number of soft gamma ray selected agns , we combine the @xmath1 sample and the @xmath0 sample . note that there are 10 objects which were detected by both of them ( see table 1 ) . using these 10 objects",
    ", we obtained a linear scaling factor from the @xmath0 luminosity to the @xmath1 one ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . with the scaling factor",
    ", we translate all the @xmath0 luminosity in 14  195 kev to the the @xmath1 luminosity in 20  100 kev .",
    "the combined sample contains 42 radio quiet compton - thin objects , 14 radio loud sources ( including 6 blazars ) and eight compton - thick objects .",
    "in fig . [ swift ] we plot the x - ray absorption column density versus the swift luminosity for the 39 agns in the swift sample .",
    "consistent with m05 , we find a clear drop of @xmath3 with increasing luminosity .",
    "since soft gamma - ray selected samples are not biased to obscuration ( except for compton thick sources ) , the sample selection is identical for both obscured and unobscured sources .",
    "we can simply study the correlation between @xmath3 and l@xmath20 ( or the luminosity distribution for obscured / unobscured sources ) in the samples without calculating the luminosity function or folding luminosity function model with the sample selection .",
    "we performed the spearman rank ( sr ) statistic to give the correlation between @xmath3 and l@xmath20 .",
    "we found a significant anti - correlation between @xmath3 and l@xmath20 at 99.99% level .",
    "we note that while a flux - limited sample would introduce spurious correlation between luminosity and redshift ( or between luminosities in different bands ) , such an effect will not affect our study since the measurement of @xmath3 is independent of redshift for the local samples . with the radio loud and compton thick sources excluded ,",
    "the confidence level of the anti - correlation significantly drops to 98% .",
    "18 out of 28 radio quiet compton - thin objects show @xmath3 @xmath21 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , yielding a fraction of 64% .    in fig .",
    "[ integral ] we plot @xmath3 versus integral luminosity for the 35 agns in the integral sample . as b06 has claimed , the fraction of absorbed agns in the whole sample significantly decreases with the 20  100 kev luminosity .",
    "we found an obvious anti - correlation between @xmath3 and l@xmath20 with a confidence level of 99.7% .",
    "however , the anti - correlation is obviously dominated by the radio loud and compton - thick objects . excluding radio loud and compton - thick objects , we found no more evidence of anti - correlation ( the null hypothesis gives a probability of 0.92 ) .",
    "14 out of 20 radio quiet compton - thin objects show @xmath3 @xmath21 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , yielding a fraction of 70% .",
    "we perform the same statistical analysis to the combined sample described in  2 ( see fig .",
    "[ combine ] ) .",
    "similarly , we find strong anti - correlation ( with confidence level @xmath5 99.99% ) between @xmath3 and l@xmath20 in the whole sample , but the anti - correlation is mainly due to the radio loud and compton - thick objects",
    ". with them excluded , the confidence level of the anti - correlation drops to 94% .",
    "a ks test also gives similar results that the luminosity distribution of obscured sources ( with @xmath3 @xmath21 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) differs from that of unobscured ones at confidence level of @xmath599.99% and 95% respectively before and after excluding the radio loud and compton thick sources . in the combined sample , 29 out of 42 radio",
    "quite compton - thin objects show @xmath3 @xmath21 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , yielding a fraction of 66.7% . for 8 luminous objects with l@xmath22 @xmath5 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath10 , 3 show @xmath3 above 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , yielding a fraction of 38% .",
    "the drop of the fraction is marginal with a confidence level of 91% , consistent with those from the correlation test and ks test .",
    "note that assuming a powerlaw spectrum with photon index of @xmath8 2.0 , l@xmath22 is directly comparable to l@xmath23 .    a recent study by shinozaki et al . ( 2006 ) built a complete flux - limited sample of bright agns from heao-1 all - sky catalogs , with a maximum redshift in the sample of 0.329 .",
    "such a sample is ideal to study the population of obscured quasars in the local universe .",
    "shinozaki et al .",
    "found no agn in the high luminosity high - intrinsic absorption regime ( log l@xmath24 $ ] @xmath5 44.5 , log @xmath25 $ ] @xmath5 21.5 ) in their sample , where @xmath8 5 agns are expected if assuming a constant fraction of obscured agns with luminosity . considering that there are 8 agns with log l@xmath24 $ ] @xmath5 44.5 and log @xmath25 $ ] @xmath26 21.5 in their sample ,",
    "the difference is at a confidence level of 98% .",
    "we note that 3 out of 8 sources are obviously radio - loud ( 3c 273 , iii zw2 and pg 1425 + 267 ) . removing the radio - loud sources , the confidence level of the difference drops to 90% .",
    "this indicates that although the sample presents a trend of decreasing fraction of obscured agns with luminosity , the decrease is not statistically solid .    we conclude that the significant decrease with luminosity in the fraction of obscured agns in the local universe might be mainly due to the radio loud and compton - thick objects in the samples . with these objects",
    "excluded , we find only marginal evidence of decrease in the swift and shinozaki sample , but no evidence of decrease in the integral sample which has a similar sample size .",
    "much larger samples are required to reach a more robust result on the fraction of obscured quasars in the local universe .",
