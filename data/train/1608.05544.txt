    "a number field , @xmath0 , is a finite extension of @xmath1 .",
    "elements of @xmath0 which are roots of monic polynomials with integral coefficients form a subring of @xmath0 called the _ ring of integers _ of @xmath0 and denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "being an extension of @xmath3 , @xmath2 shares many properties with @xmath3 . yet , determining for which @xmath0 , @xmath2 is a unique factorization domain ( which is in this case equivalent to being a principal ideal domain ) is one of the most fundamental open questions of algebraic number theory .",
    "a measure for this property is the class number of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath4 , that is the order of the ideal class group @xmath5 , which is the multiplicative group of ideals of @xmath2 modulo the subgroup of principal ideals .",
    "the class number @xmath6 if and only if @xmath2 is a unique factorization domain .",
    "as @xmath2 is a dedekind domain , every fractional ideal of @xmath0 , can be generated by at most two elements .",
    "hence one has a map from projectivized ordered pairs of elements of @xmath2 , which is a group under ideal multiplication denoted by @xmath7 , to @xmath8 .",
    "this map is bijective exactly when @xmath2 admits a unit of norm @xmath9 .",
    "else , this map becomes a 2-to-1 map and the group @xmath7 is called the _ narrow class group_. analogously , the order of @xmath7 , denoted @xmath10 is called the _ narrow class number_.    let us now restrict the extension degree to @xmath11 , i.e. consider the quadratic case .",
    "any such number field @xmath0 is equal to @xmath12 for some square - free integer @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the both narrow class group and the class group is computed using the corresponding binary quadratic forms of gau , @xcite . whenever @xmath14 , @xmath0 is called real quadratic and whenever @xmath15 , @xmath0 is called imaginary .",
    "in fact , for the imaginary quadratic case gau has determined `` almost '' all such number fields with class number one .",
    "it turns out that @xmath2 is a principal ideal domain if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "however , the question of determining real quadratic number fields of class number one is still open and is referred to as class number one problem of gau .",
    "it must be noted that the number of such number fields is expected to be infinite .    in this paper , we introduce four families of multivariate polynomials named as @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this work is focused to study the family @xmath19 , though we point out properties of the remaining three polynomial families , too .",
    "for instance , we will see that the polynomial family @xmath20 is closely related to fibonacci polynomials .",
    "the family @xmath19 will be called multivariate lucas polynomials . naming stems from the fact that if one reduces these polynomials to one variable , then the classical lucas polynomials are obtained .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for the family @xmath20 , that is they restrict to classical fibonacci polynomials .",
    "our main motivation for introducing such a family of polynomials is that given any real quadratic number field @xmath0 we use multivariate lucas polynomials to define an affine surface , called _ ark surface _ of @xmath0 , whose integral points are in one - to - one correspondence with narrow ideal classes in @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to access the more than 200 years old class number problems of gau from a completely different point of view .",
    "indeed , ark surfaces produce high degree projective surfaces which are conjecturally kobayashi hyperbolic . by a conjecture of lang they have finitely many @xmath1-rational points .",
    "reader is suggested to consult @xcite and references therein for further details on this point of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section is devoted to defining and establishing basic properties of the aforementioned polynomial sequences . in particular ,",
    "multivariate lucas and fibonacci polynomials are defined . in the last section after a quick review of narrow ideal classes and the narrow ideal class group of a quadratic number field , we define the automorphism group of a narrow ideal class . in the real quadratic case ,",
    "this group is isomorphic to @xmath3 generated by a hyperbolic element of @xmath21 . using this we attach an infinite bipartite ribbon graph , called ark in @xcite , to a narrow ideal class and show how they give rise to integral points of an appropriate affine surface .",
    "in this section , we will introduce four families of polynomials , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , indexed over positive integers .",
    "these polynomials have either rational or imaginary rational coefficients .",
    "the second part is devoted to listing certain properties which will be required in upcoming sections .",
    "pauli matrices , which have proven themselves to be useful tools in the context of quantum mechanics , are defined as @xmath23    they are of order two and satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "they are traceless and their determinant is @xmath9 , hence their eigenvalues are @xmath25 .",
    "together with the identity matrix pauli matrices form a basis for the vector space of matrices of size @xmath26 with complex entries .",
    "in particular , for the matrix @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being complex variables , the coefficients of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 become @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "more generally , for a sequence of even number of complex numbers @xmath38 we define @xmath39 then there should exist polynomials , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath40 so that    @xmath41 for instance , for @xmath42 , one finds immediately that @xmath43    the four families of polynomials satisfy the following recursive relations :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 stands for @xmath46 .",
    "these set of relations can be obtained directly from the relations among pauli matrices .",
    "it must be pointed out that these are not the only set of equations that defines the families @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , if we let @xmath47 denote the number of partitions of the positive integer @xmath48 , then there are @xmath49-many different such formulations .",

    "using the correspondence between automorphisms and solutions of the pell equation @xmath283 , see section  [ sec : automorphisms ] , we obtain @xmath284 and satisfies @xmath285 .              one way of this correspondence can be obtained by using theorem  [ thm : affine / equation ] and noting the fact that the action of @xmath292 does not change the conjugacy class of the fundamental automorphism of narrow ideal classes .",
    "conversely , if we start with an integral point on @xmath294 , say @xmath295 , one can construct the element @xmath296 and look at the narrow ideal class that arises from the binary quadratic form whose fundamental automorphism is @xmath206 , namely if @xmath297 then the corresponding indefinite primitive binary quadratic form is @xmath298 ; where @xmath299 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 . since this point is a solution of equation  [ eq : cark / hypersurface ] ; where by definition @xmath303 is minimal , the discriminant of this form must be square - free .",
