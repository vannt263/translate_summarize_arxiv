    "a _ cellular game _ is a dynamical system ; that is , the variables it is composed of are regarded as changing over time . these variables or cells , arranged in a discrete structure such as a ring ,",
    "are thought of as repeatedly playing a game with their neighbors .",
    "most of this paper is concerned with one - dimensional cellular games , defined more formally as follows :    [ chapter ]    [ cgame ] a * one - dimensional cellular game * consists of :    1 .   a one - dimensional discrete structure , uniform from the viewpoint of each site ; that is , a ring or doubly infinite path .",
    "2 .   a variable , or * cell * , at each site .",
    "the components of this variable may change at each discrete unit of time , or * round*. they consist of , at least : 1 .",
    "a * move * component , which can take on a finite number @xmath2 of values .",
    "a * strategy * component , which determines what move a cell makes in a given round .",
    "the strategy of a cell is based on past moves of it and its @xmath3 nearest neighbors on each side .",
    "the number of past rounds considered is called the * depth * @xmath4 of the strategy .",
    "this @xmath3 , as used above , is the * radius * of the game .",
    "3 .   a fitness criterion , which does not change and is the same for each cell .",
    "this fitness criterion is usually local ; that is , the fitness of a cell in each round is based on its move , and those of nearest neighbors within the radius of the game .",
    "4 .   a mechanism for strategy selection , under which more fit strategies survive and spread .",
    "strategy selection is usually nonlocal ; that is , a more fit strategy may spread arbitrarily far in a fixed number of time units .",
    "an interval between strategy changes , which may be one or more rounds , is called a * generation*.    thus , a cellular game can be considered a process in which cells make moves each round , based on their strategies , and strategies are updated in each generation , based on their fitness in preceding rounds .",
    "note that cellular game strategies and fitness criteria are usually stored in the form of a table .",
    "also note that @xmath5-dimensional cellular automata , with one cell for each @xmath5-tuple of integers or integers mod @xmath2 , can be similarly defined .",
    "one - dimensional cellular games are studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "similar systems are discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; and games on a two - dimensional lattice in @xcite .",
    "cellular games satisfy a criterion for `` artificial life '' as discussed by christopher langton @xcite .",
    "that is , `` there are _ no _ rules in the system that dictate global behavior .",
    "any behavior at levels higher than the ( individual cells ) is , therefore , emergent . ''",
    "cellular games are a generalization and extension of another , more well - known , discrete dynamical system ; that is , of _ cellular automata_. they were created largely because of questions arising from the observation of cellular automata .",
    "one - dimensional cellular automata are defined as follows :    [ ca ]    a * one - dimensional cellular automaton * consists of :    * a one - dimensional discrete structure , uniform from the viewpoint of each site ; that is , a ring or doubly infinite path . * a variable , or * cell * , at each site , that can take on finitely many values or * states*. the initial states of a cell may be specified as desired . * a function which decides how each cell changes state from one * generation * , or discrete unit of time , to the next .",
    "this function , or * cellular automaton rule * , is always the same for each cell , and depends entirely on the state of a cell and that of its @xmath3 neighbors on each side in the past @xmath6 generations .",
    "this @xmath3 is referred to as the * radius * of the cellular automaton , and @xmath6 as its * order*. cellular automaton rules are usually stored and described in the form of a table .",
    "it can be shown that a @xmath6th - order cellular automaton is equivalent to a first - order cellular automaton with more states .",
    "this proof @xcite , however , is dependent on the locality of cellular automata  that is , on the fact that cells are directly affected only by their neighbors . for similar mathematical objects , such as cellular games , that are",
    "not _ local , this proof can not be used .",
    "thus , if a cellular automaton , of radius @xmath3 , operates on cells that can take @xmath2 possible states , there are @xmath7 possible circumstances that need to be considered .",
    "the rule table , therefore , has @xmath7 entries ; and there are @xmath8 possible @xmath3-radius , @xmath2-state cellular automaton rules .",
    "an example of a cellular automaton rule is the two - state , radius one rule whose evolution is illustrated below . in this rule , a cell can be in either state @xmath0 or state @xmath1 .",
    "any cell that , in generation @xmath9 is in state @xmath1 , and has both of its neighbors in state @xmath1 , stays in state @xmath1 in generation @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , a cell is in state @xmath0 in generation @xmath10 .",
    "this rule is rule 128 according to wolfram s @xcite classification system of the @xmath11 @xmath12-state , radius one rules .    generation 1:xx= 1 xx0 xx= 1 xx= 1 xx= 1 xx= 1 xx= 0 xx= 1 xx= 0xx= 1 xxgeneration 1 : 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 + generation 2 : 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 + generation 3 : 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 +    [ defn ] table    the action of rule 128 on a circular ring of ten cells , for three generations .",
    "a * stochastic cellular automaton * is as above , except that neighborhood states do not determine the move made in the next generation , but the probability that a particular move will be made .",
    "computer experiments on one - dimensional cellular automata are usually conducted with cells arranged in a ring .",
    "cell states are indicated by colors ; thus , @xmath2-state cellular automaton rules are often referred to as @xmath2-color rules .",
    "initial conditions are displayed in a line on top of the screen , with each generation being displayed below the previous generation . in such experiments , initial conditions , and rule table entries , are often chosen with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "descriptions of computer experiments with cellular automata and other discrete dynamical systems often make reference , informally , to `` random '' initial conditions .",
    "this concept actually applies to mathematical models containing infinitely many variables , such as a one - dimensional cellular automaton with one cell for each integer . in such a case ,",
    "`` random , '' `` almost all , '' or `` normal '' initial conditions refer to conditions such that all @xmath13 of the @xmath5-tuples of @xmath2 cell states are equally likely , for all @xmath5 . or , in other words , if the states of the cells are construed as decimal places of two real numbers , both numbers are normal to base @xmath2",
    ".    such conditions can not be exactly duplicated in the finite case , no matter how large the number of cells .",
    "however , conditions can be created which appear disordered and satisfy certain statistical tests of disorder .",
    "this is done with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator .",
    "such initial conditions are often loosely referred to as `` random . ''",
    "computer simulations of discrete dynamical systems often use such initial conditions as the most feasible indicator of likely behavior .    in such experiments , there are , roughly , three types of asymptotic behavior .",
    "first of all , all cells may become and remain one color , or change color periodically , with a small and easily observable period .",
    "second , cells may display `` chaotic '' behavior ; that is , cell color choice may appear to be disordered , or to result from some other simple stochastic algorithm .",
    "third , cell color choice may be neither periodic nor chaotic , but appear to display organized complexity .",
    "that is , the cell evolution diagrams may look like biological structures , such as plants , or social structures , such as city maps . as a matter of fact ,",
    "such diagrams are often quite esthetically pleasing .",
    "these rule types are discussed in @xcite ; for more on the concept of `` complexity , '' as it applies to cellular automaton rules , see @xcite .    on a finite ring of cells , of course , all such evolution is eventually periodic .",
    "but , if cells can be in @xmath12 states , and there are @xmath14 cells , there are @xmath15 possible ring states . therefore the period of ring states could , conceivably , be quite high ; and `` chaotic '' or `` complex '' rules do indeed seem to have very high periods .",
    "visual representations of cellular automata can exhibit a sophistication reminiscent of living structures .",
    "however , the number of @xmath2-state , @xmath3-radius cellular automaton rules is very large ( @xmath8 ) for all but the smallest @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; and `` interesting '' rules are not common and difficult to find .",
    "this leads to the question , therefore , of whether there is some way of `` evolving '' cellular automaton rules in a desired direction .",
    "there are two possible avenues of approach to this question .",
    "one is to select rules based on their global properties .",
    "that is , some computable measure of the desired characteristics is devised , and rules are chosen by their ability to meet this measure .",
    "such selections are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the other way is to select rules based on their local properties .",
    "that is , each cell uses a different rule ; and there is some universal and unchanging criterion for rule success .",
    "this approach is more like the way living systems evolve , for the evolution of a planetary ecology is not due to constraints placed directly on the ecology .",
    "it is an emergent property of constraints placed on the individual organisms .",
    "for this reason , such models may potentially reveal not only the nature of `` complex '' rules , but also how their global properties emerge from local interactions .",
    "an evolutionary model of this sort is equivalent to a cellular game ; the only difference is the terminology .",
    "that is , the strategy of a cell can be regarded as the individual rule used by each cell ; the depth of the strategy as the order of the rule ; cell moves as states ; and instead of referring to the smallest unit of time as a round , and a possibly larger unit as a generation , the smallest unit can , as with cellular automata , be referred to as a generation .",
    "the fitness criteria and evolutionary process stay the same .",
    "a cellular game differs from a cellular automaton not only in the precise definition used , but also in the philosophy under which this definition was constructed .",
    "that is :    * cellular automata are often regarded as a physical models ; for example , each cell may be seen as an individual atom .",
    "thus , the rules by which each cell operates are the same . cellular games , on the other hand , are seen as an evolutionary models .",
    "each cell uses an individual rule , or strategy , which can be thought of as the `` genetic code '' of the cell . * cellular automata",
    "are usually thought of as deterministic , beyond the initial generation , though stochastic cellular automata have also been studied .",
    "cellular games operate stochastically ; that is , the evolutionary process under which strategies are modified is stochastic , and , often , the strategies themselves are stochastic . *",
    "cellular automata are local ; that is , the state of a cell is affected only by the states of its @xmath3 nearest neighbors on each side in the previous generation .",
    "in other words , cell information can not travel more than @xmath3 units per generation .",
    "this speed is often called `` the speed of light . ''",
    "cellular games , on the other hand , typically use nonlocal strategy selection criteria .",
    "that is , a more fit strategy may propagate arbitrarily far in one generation .",
    "( there is more discussion of the nonlocality of cellular games in section [ zdm ] . ) * in @xcite , it is shown that @xmath6th - order cellular automata are behaviorally equivalent to first - order cellular automata with larger radius and more states . however , this proof does not work for cellular games with nonlocal selection criteria .",
    "moreover , cellular games are often constructed with strategies looking more than one generation back .",
    "now , it can be shown that if a cellular game has a local fitness criterion and local rule selection process , it is actually equivalent to a cellular automaton with a large number of states .",
    "this automaton , of course , will be stochastic if the game is stochastic .",
    "[ defn ] theorem    let @xmath16 be a cellular game with a local fitness criterion and local rule selection process , which operates every @xmath17 rounds .",
    "let all fitness measurements start over again after this process .",
    "then @xmath16 is equivalent to a cellular automaton @xmath18 with a much larger number of states .",
    "_ let @xmath18 be constructed as follows : let the state of a cell @xmath19 in @xmath18 be a vector with the following components :    1 .   the state of @xmath19 in @xmath16 .",
    "the individual rule used by @xmath19 , in @xmath16 .",
    "3 .   a @xmath17-valued counting variable , which starts out as @xmath1 in the first generation , and thereafter corresponds to the current generation mod @xmath17 .",
    "4 .   a fitness variable , which corresponds to the accumulated fitness of a cell over @xmath17 rounds .    since",
    "these components enable @xmath18 to simulate the action of @xmath16 , it suffices to show that @xmath18 is a cellular automaton .",
    "that is , each component must have only finitely many possible values , and be locally determined .",
    "this is shown to be true for each component , as follows :    1 .   by definition of @xmath16 ,",
    "the first component has only finitely many values .",
    "it is determined by the rule of a cell , and the states of it and its neighbors in preceding rounds .",
    "2 .   by definition [ cgame ] ,",
    "even if stochastic rules are used only finitely many are considered . whether or not a cell keeps its rule , after @xmath17 rounds , is based on its own fitness , and the process of selecting new rules is assumed to be local .",
    "3 .   the counting component can be in any one of @xmath17 different states .",
    "the rule for its change is simple : if it is in state @xmath20 in round @xmath4 , it is in state @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath9 in round @xmath23 .",
    "note that to run @xmath18 as a simulation of @xmath16 , this counting component must be initially set at the same value for all cells .",
    "the fitness component is set to zero after every @xmath17 rounds ; and can be incremented or decremented in only finitely many different ways .",
    "how it changes in each generation , for a given cell @xmath19 , depends on the first components of cells @xmath24 through @xmath25 .    ' '' ''    given this equivalence , why , then , is a cellular game so different from a cellular automaton ?",
    "for one thing , cellular games often do use a nonlocal strategy selection process ; it may be considered an approximation to a selection process that can operate over very large distances . for another , cellular automaton rule spaces , especially those with high radius , typically contain very large numbers of rules .",
    "therefore , even if only systems with a local selection process are considered , the evolutionary paradigm of cellular games may still be valuable .",
    "it may be a practical method of selecting members of these spaces with interesting properties .    in this paper ,",
    "two different models of cellular games are defined .",
    "the original arthur - packard - rogers model is discussed first in section [ apr ] .",
    "this model is quite extensive and uses many different parameters .",
    "the second , simplified , model is more amenable to mathematical analysis . this model is discussed in section [ zdm ] .",
    "computer simulations of both models are presented .",
    "these simulations are similar to those of cellular automata , both in the way they are conducted and in the way they are displayed .",
    "that is , cell moves are indicated by colors .",
    "strategies are usually not pictured , due to the large size of strategy spaces .",
    "thus , the move of a cell may also be referred to as its color .",
    "initial moves of a finite ring of cells are displayed in a line on top of the screen , and each generation is displayed below the previous generation .",
    "initial moves and strategies , as well as other stochastic choices during the course of the game , are implemented with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator .",
    "computer simulations of the first model display sophisticated behavior reminiscent of living systems , or `` complicated '' cellular automata .",
    "these behaviors , which include such phenomena as zone growth and `` punctuated equilibria , '' are discussed and extensively illustrated in section [ comp1 ] .",
    "the second model admits only deterministic strategies of depth zero ; that is , strategies of the form , `` do move @xmath6 , without regard to previous rounds . ''",
    "thus , in this model , moves and strategies can be considered equivalent . though this model is simpler , there are still counterintuitive results associated with it . even if only two strategies are allowed under this model , it is extremely difficult to predict which , if either , will be stable under invasion by the other .",
    "there are no simple algorithms for determining this .",
    "for example , consider ring viability , discussed in section [ rvsec ] .",
    "for finite rings this concept , definition [ ringviability ] , refers to the average success of all cells in the ring . in this chapter",
    ", it is shown that under any local fitness criterion @xmath16 , rings in which the cells have made periodic move sequences have the highest possible viability .",
    "it is also shown that a similar result is false in the two - dimensional case .",
    "now , if cellular games did indeed always evolve towards highest ring viability , this would make their course relatively easy to predict .",
    "however , in section [ stabsec ] , a two - strategy cellular game is presented , in which the best strategy for the ring as a whole  that is , the strategy that , if every cell follows it , maximizes ring viability  is not stable under invasion .",
    "this instability is illustrated by computer simulations , and is also proved .",
    "this is done by showing that if a small number of cells using the invading strategy are surrounded by large numbers that are not , the invading strategy tends to spread in the next generation .",
    "the reason for this is that the first strategy , though it does well against itself , does poorly against the second one .    on the other hand ,",
    "a winning strategy may not necessarily be stable either .",
    "that is , strategy a may defeat strategy b , but still be unable to resist invasion by it .",
    "the reason , in this case , is that strategy b does so much better against itself .",
    "this result can also be demonstrated by computer simulations and proved , using the same method .",
    "these results are also in section [ stabsec ] .",
    "finally , consider a situation in which , if its neighbors use strategy a , a cell has greatest success if it uses strategy a too .",
    "it seems logical that , in this case , strategy a would indeed be stable . as a matter of fact",
    ", such a situation is called , in game theory , a _",
    "symmetric nash equilibrium_.    however , it can be demonstrated by computer simulations , and also proved , that some symmetric nash equilibrium strategies are _ not _ stable under invasion .",
    "the reason , in such cases , is that strategy b has somewhat less probability of surviving in a strategy a environment , but is very good at causing strategy a not to survive .",
    "therefore strategy b is somewhat less likely to persist , but is a lot more likely to spread .",
    "this result is also considered in section [ stabsec ] .",
    "thus , the three theorems in section [ stabsec ] show how difficult it is to predict the course of cellular games , even under a very simple model .",
    "the counterintuitive nature of the results obtained suggests the potential mathematical interest of this paradigm .",
    "the second part of this thesis presents results applicable to particular examples of the zero - depth model , called _ simple cellular games_. these games have two distinguishing characteristics :    * there are only two possible strategies ; these two strategies are referred to as white , and black .",
    "* each cell has , at all times , positive probability of either living or not living .",
    "the theorems discussed in the second part apply to simple cellular games which are left / right symmetric .",
    "the double glider theorem , [ main ] , applies to the evolution of such games under initial conditions under which there are only finitely many black cells .",
    "the _ zone of uncertainty _ is defined as the zone between the leftmost and rightmost black cell .",
    "it is shown that the probability this zone will expand arbitrarily far in one direction only is @xmath0 .",
    "that is , with probability @xmath1 , it will either expand in both directions or disappear .",
    "section [ stanrec ] , which follows , discusses simple game evolution in a slightly different context ; that is , under conditions such that there is a leftmost white cell and a rightmost black cell , or _",
    "standard restricted initial conditions_. simple cellular games with both left / right and black / white symmetry are classified according to their asymptotic behavior under these circumstances .",
    "that is , they are divided into _ mixing processes _ and _ clumping processes_. the behavior of clumping processes is further explored , and a conjecture is made that applies to both kinds of processes .    in section [ examples ] , the last chapter , specific examples of simple cellular games are presented .",
    "computer simulations suggest that one of these examples , the join or die process , is a clumping process ; and the other , the mixing process , is , as named , a mixing process .",
    "success criteria in tabular form , or score tables , are extensively used in game theory .",
    "they describe the course of any game which can be exactly modelled , for which strategy success can be numerically described , and in which all strategies are based on finite , exact information . for example , consider the game of scissors , paper , stone ; that is , scissors beats paper , paper beats stone , and stone beats scissors .",
    "suppose this game is played for one round , and the only possible strategies are deterministic .",
    "then the table for this game is ( if a win scores 1 , tie at .5 and loss at 0 ) :    opponent xxxx= sxxcissors= xxpaper= xxstoneopponent scissors paper stone +   + player + scissors .5 1 0 + paper 0 .5 1 + stone 1 0 .5 +    the following definition is used in game theory :    a * mixed strategy * is a stochastic strategy ; that is , one under which , in some specified circumstances , more than one move has positive probability .    a table can also be devised for mixed strategies , and for games of more than one round . for mixed strategies the table entry describes the expected success .    for example , suppose the game of scissors , paper stone is played for two rounds , and there are three possible strategies .",
    "strategy a is to choose each move with probability @xmath26 , strategy b is to choose stone for the first move , and the move chosen by the other player for the second , and strategy c is always to choose paper .",
    "then the table for this game is :    strategy aaac= strategy ca= strategy ca= strategy acopponent strategy a strategy b strategy c +   + player + strategy a 1 1 1 + strategy b 1 1 .5 + strategy c 1 1.5 1 +    a table depicting strategy success as described above is called the * normal form * of a game .",
    "normal form can be used , at least theoretically , to describe extremely sophisticated games .",
    "for example , if only a fixed finite number of moves are allowed , and strategies consider only the history of the current game , then there are only finitely many deterministic strategies for the game of chess . hence normal form could , at least theoretically , be used to describe this game .",
    "of course , there are so many possible chess strategies that this form can not be used for practical purposes . for more on normal form ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that this form is ambiguous if mixed strategies are allowed .",
    "for example , consider the above table .",
    "does it indicate the actual success levels of deterministic strategies , or the expected success levels of stochastic ones ?",
    "it is not possible to tell without further information .",
    "such a normal form can also be used to describe three - player games .",
    "for example , this table describes a game in which there are two moves , you score .85 if you make the same move as both other players and .15 otherwise .",
    "this game is called the join or die game .",
    "your move : xx= b xx = xx w exextra= your move : xx= xx b= xx wyour move : b your move : w +   + player 1 : b w player 1 : b w +   + player 2 : player 2 : + b .85 .15 b .15 .15 + w .15 .15 w .15 .85 +    now , consider cellular games .",
    "if the success criterion , or score , is local ; that is , if it is based entirely on the state of a cell and those of its neighbors , it can also be encoded as a table . as a matter of fact",
    ", any game table for @xmath27 players can be used as the score table for a cellular game of radius @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the join or die process is a cellular game of radius @xmath1 , in which each cell plays the join or die game with its two nearest neighbors .",
    "the following table is used for this process :    right neighbor : xx= b xx = xx w exextra= right neighbor : xx= xx b= xx wcell s move : b cell s move : w +   + right neighbor : b w right neighbor : b w +   + left neighbor : left neighbor : + b .85 .15 b .15 .15 + w .15 .15 w .15 .85 +    however , cellular games differ from the situations most analyzed by game theorists , or the vernacular notion of a game , in the following ways :    * each cell interacts with different neighbors , as determined by the discrete structure on which the cellular game is run .",
    "that is , the score of cell @xmath0 is based on its move , and those of cells @xmath1 and @xmath28 .",
    "the score of cell @xmath1 is based on the moves of cells @xmath0 and @xmath12 , not cells @xmath0 and @xmath28 . *",
    "the `` game '' is considered to be played repeatedly , for many rounds .",
    "thus , the main focus is on optimal move behavior in the long run , not for one round only .",
    "* there is an explicit mechanism for determining how successful strategies thrive and spread .",
    "the cellular game is not completely described without this mechanism ; no assumptions about asymptotic behavior can be made just on the basis of the score table .",
    "the idea of cellular games was first developed by norman packard and brian arthur at the santa fe institute @xcite ; and first written up by k. c. rogers , in a master s thesis at the university of illinois under the direction of dr .",
    "packard @xcite . in this model ,",
    "cells arranged in a ring play a game , such as the well - known prisoner s dilemma , with each of their nearest neighbors .",
    "they play for a fixed number of rounds . at the end of these rounds , or of a generation , strategies may change .",
    "successful strategies are most likely to spread and persist .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is discussed in @xcite , @xcite and appendix [ appris ] .    for details of this model ,",
    "see appendix [ rogers ] .",
    "the terms used are described in definition [ cgame ] .",
    "the arthur - packard - rogers model can be summarized as follows : cells , arranged in a one - dimensional structure , play a game , such as the prisoner s dilemma , with their neighbors , for a predetermined number of rounds .",
    "the criteria for success in each round do not change , and are the same for each cell .",
    "since the degree of success is based only on the moves of a cell and those of its @xmath3 nearest neighbors on each side , this criterion can be encoded in the form of a table .",
    "the strategies that govern cell move choices may be different for each cell , may be deterministic or stochastic , are based on past move history , and are stored in the form of a table .",
    "strategies may have depth zero , one , or more .    at the end of these rounds  that is , at the end of a generation ",
    "the probability that a cell keeps its strategy in the next generation is proportional to the size of its reward variable , which measures its success in the game .",
    "* cell death * : a cell is said to die if its strategy is deemed replaceable ; that is , it is thought of as unsuccessful .",
    "the replacing strategy is usually derived from the strategies of other cells .    finally , if a cell dies at the end of a generation , the strategy chosen is some combination of the strategies of its nearest living neighbors .",
    "if it contains elements of both neighbors , crossover is said to occur .",
    "[ crossover ] * crossover * is the existence , in a new strategy , of behavior similar to more than one `` parent '' strategy .",
    "[ parents ] those cells whose strategies contribute to the new strategy of a cell are called its * parents*.    there may also be a small probability of strategy table mutation .",
    "[ mutation ] a * mutation * is said to occur when , after a strategy table entry has been chosen from a parent cell , it is arbitrarily changed .    in computer simulations ,",
    "this is often done with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator .",
    "this model is not quite the same as the original one used in @xcite . in that construction , strategy replacement",
    "was not governed by locality ; that is , parent cells were the most successful in the ring .",
    "thus , the progenitor of the strategy of a cell was not particularly likely to be nearby",
    ".    in this model , however , parent cells are not necessarily the most successful cells in the ring .",
    "instead , they are the nearest living neighbors of a cell .",
    "such a model is more comparable with living systems , because it bases system evolution more completely on local properties .",
    "it is also more easily generalizable to the infinite case , in which there is one cell for each integer .",
    "and it is only under such a model that one can see the evolution of zones of different strategies .",
    "the arthur - packard - rogers model has been simulated in computer experiments , with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator .",
    "cell moves are displayed onscreen , in a form similar to the display of cellular automaton states .",
    "that is , initial moves , for each generation , are shown in a line on top of the screen ; and moves for each round are shown below the preceding round . in experiments simulating the prisoner s",
    "dilemma , or variations , lighter areas indicate cooperative moves ; dark areas , defecting moves . in particular , in the games illustrated in the accompanying figures , all strategies are mixed , or stochastic .",
    "that is , there is always at least a small probability that a move is made other than the one called for by the strategy .",
    "the experiment illustrated in figures 1 through 14 simulates a variation of the prisoner s dilemma , the stag hunt .",
    "the stag hunt is modeled on the dilemma of a member of a pack of hunting animals , such as wolves or coyotes .",
    "if the whole pack hunts together , they can bring down a stag , which is the highest reward .",
    "if a member defects , it will be able to get a rabbit alone .",
    "if the other animals do not defect , they will have a smaller chance of bringing down a stag , but it may still be possible ; but it is very unlikely that one animal can bring down a stag all by itself .",
    "thus , the highest expected reward is for mutual cooperation ; next highest , for defecting while the other members of the pack cooperate ; next , for mutual defection , and fourth , for cooperating while the other members of the pack defect . see @xcite for more information on the stag hunt ; and appendix [ appendix1 ] for a more technical discussion of the experiments .",
    "these computer experiments fully suggest the mathematical interest of the subject .",
    "they reveal thought - provoking behavior , such as :    * _ zone growth .",
    "_ strategies may not evolve in the same manner in all areas of the ring .",
    "zones of cooperative , defecting or other consistent behavior may arise and persist for generations . *",
    "_ periodic structures .",
    "_ cells may alternate between cooperation and defection , or waves of cooperation may spread through some or all zones of the ring . * _ `` complexity . '' _ move patterns may display a sophistication reminiscent of living structures , or the patterns found in `` complex '' cellular automata . * _ long transients . _",
    "strategies predominant for hundreds of generations may ultimately disappear , and be replaced by completely different behavior . * _ `` punctuated equilibria . ''",
    "_ move behavior that appears to be stable for many generations may , suddenly , change very quickly  and then become stable again , for a long time .",
    "note that cellular games can not be construed to represent any particular living systems , social or biological .",
    "for one thing , their behavior changes very easily as parameters are modified ; it is difficult to tell which features are essential , or appropriate to any particular model . however , the existence of the above characteristics suggests that cellular games are evocative of biological evolution .",
    "it seems possible that the two will turn out to have some features in common .",
    "now , these experiments well suggest the richness of behavior cellular games offer .",
    "the sophistication of patterns displayed provides ample justification for further study of this paradigm .",
    "but the arthur - packard - rogers model does not lend itself well to mathematical analysis .",
    "its computer implementation is lengthy and contains many modifiable parameters .",
    "it is difficult to decide if any behavior exhibited is general , or just an artifact of the specific algorithms used .    to facilitate mathematical discussion of cellular game behavior",
    ", it is hence appropriate to simplify the model .",
    "extensive study has been performed on such a model , exhibiting the following simplifications :    * _ elimination of crossover . _",
    "the arthur - packard - rogers model allows crossover .",
    "( definition [ crossover ] . )",
    "+ in the simplified model , crossover is eliminated , and each new strategy is an exact copy of one that already exists .",
    "a rationale for this simplification , in terms of living systems , is that one is considering the evolution of a specific gene , which spreads on an either - or basis .",
    "however , a particular gene may be significant only in the context of other factors .",
    "it may thus not be appropriate to consider this gene on its own .",
    "note that computer experiments using genetic algorithms reinforce the significance of crossover ( see @xcite ) . *",
    "_ elimination of mutation .",
    "_ another simplification is the elimination of mutation ( definition [ mutation ] ) .",
    "that is , after the initial round , any strategy is new for a specific cell only , and is a copy of the strategy used by an existing cell . particularly without crossover , this elimination is actually likely to change the long - term behavior of the system .",
    "for example , suppose strategy a is successful against all other strategies , including itself .",
    "if a ring of cells is originally free of strategy a , but mutation is allowed , strategy a will eventually take over the ring .",
    "if there is no mutation , the ring will stay free of it .",
    "however , the behavior of a cellular game that allows mutation may best be understood in terms of , and in comparison to , the behavior of the simpler system . *",
    "_ one round per generation .",
    "_ that is , cell strategy may change after each round of play . * _ elimination of mixed strategies .",
    "_ strategies are deterministic , not stochastic . * _ elimination of depth . _",
    "the final simplification is the elimination of depth .",
    "that is , all strategies are executed without regard to past moves . since there are no mixed strategies , the strategy , then ,",
    "just becomes `` do move @xmath6 , '' and the move variable can thus be eliminated from the description of the game .",
    "the question of how depth and round restrictions affect cellular game behavior is a subject for future research ; however , these restrictions are not as severe as they seem . from game theory , we learn that all information about games with extremely sophisticated strategies can be conveyed in table form ; that is , the `` normal '' form of a game .",
    "the only restriction is that strategies must take into account only a finite amount of information ; e.g. , the course of the game , but not anything before or beyond .",
    "as previously discussed , such tables can be used as the score table for a cellular game ; in particular , for a zero - depth , one round per generation cellular game .    as a matter of fact",
    ", cellular games of many rounds per generation , and with high - depth strategies , can be rewritten as zero - depth one round games  if all strategies take into account the current generation only .",
    "note that the arthur - packard - rogers model , discussed above , does take into account moves in the previous generation .",
    "however , it could easily be modified not to do so , by providing table entries to use when there is limited information about previous rounds .",
    "for example , there could be an entry for the move used if nothing is known about previous moves .",
    "let @xmath16 be a cellular game of radius @xmath3 , with @xmath17 rounds per generation , and strategies of depth @xmath4  except that all strategies take into account only moves in the current generation .",
    "then the action of @xmath16 can be exactly simulated by a cellular game @xmath18 of zero depth and one round per generation .",
    "_ it suffices to show that for every such game @xmath16 there is a zero - depth , one round cellular game @xmath18 , and a mapping @xmath29 from strategies in @xmath16 to strategies in @xmath18 , such that life probabilities correspond .",
    "actions made after cell survival is decided can be the same in each case .",
    "that is , suppose there are two rings of @xmath2 cells each , @xmath30 .",
    "let the first ring run @xmath16 in generation @xmath9 , and let each cell @xmath19 use strategy @xmath31 .",
    "let the second ring run @xmath18 in that generation , and let each cell @xmath32 use strategy @xmath33 .",
    "then the probability , at the beginning of @xmath9 , that @xmath19 survives into the next generation should be the same as the probability that @xmath32 does .    to show that such an @xmath29 can be constructed",
    ", it suffices to show that the probability that , under @xmath16 , at the beginning of a generation , that a cell will live through to the next generation is entirely dependent on its strategy , and those of its @xmath34 nearest neighbors on each side . for",
    "if this is true , a table can be constructed , giving the life probability for cell @xmath19 if it and its neighbors follow strategies @xmath35 @xmath36 ; and this table can be used to create a zero - depth , one round cellular game with corresponding life probabilities .",
    "now life probabilities in @xmath16 , at the end of a generation , are entirely dependent on the move histories of that generation .",
    "therefore , to show such strategy dependence , it is only necessary to show that the probability , at the beginning of @xmath9 , that cell @xmath19 will make move @xmath6 in generation @xmath37 , is entirely dependent on the strategies of @xmath19 and those of its @xmath38 neighbors on each side .",
    "this is trivially true in the first round of a generation .",
    "since a cell has no information about past moves , the probability it makes move @xmath6 is entirely dependent on its own strategy .    now , suppose this is true for the first @xmath39 rounds . in round @xmath37 ,",
    "the probability a cell makes move @xmath6 is entirely dependent on its strategy , and the moves made by it and its @xmath3 neighbors on each side , in preceding rounds of this generation .",
    "therefore , by the induction hypothesis , this probability at the beginning of a generation is entirely dependent on the strategies of the @xmath40 neighbors of _ these _ cells  cells @xmath41 through @xmath42 .    ' '' ''    we are thus left with the following model , in which , associated with each cell @xmath19 , in each generation @xmath9 , are :    * a move / strategy variable @xmath43 from some finite alphabet @xmath44 of @xmath2 characters . * a binary - valued life variable @xmath45 .",
    "this variable can be set to either living , or not living .    in each generation , cell strategies change , as follows :    * the probability that the life variable of a cell is set to 1 , so that it `` lives '' into the next generation , is determined by a universal and unchanging game matrix @xmath16 .",
    "that probability is based on the move / strategies of a cell and those of its @xmath3 nearest neighbors on each side , in that generation . *",
    "a live cell keeps its strategy in the next generation .",
    "* a cell that does not live is given a new strategy in the next generation .",
    "this strategy is either that of its living nearest neighbor to the left , or to the right , with a 50% probability of each . if there are no living neighbors to either side , all possible strategies are equally likely .",
    "note that , in this model , exactly two decisions are made in a generation ; first , decisions about cell life or death ; and second , decisions , for dead cells , of color in the next generation .",
    "this model lends itself easily to computer simulation , with the different strategies represented by different colors .",
    "thus , in descriptions of this model , `` move , '' `` strategy , '' and `` color '' are equivalent",
    ". such a simulation is presented at the end of this paper , in figure [ cl ] . in this simulation ,",
    "a cell has probability @xmath46 of living if it is the same color as both of its neighbors and @xmath47 otherwise .",
    "due to the shapes of the space - time zones produced , this process is called the cloud process .",
    "the cloud process is an example of a join / mix cellular game , as discussed in section [ examples ] .",
    "we now discuss a theorem pertinent to this model ; that is , a simple characterization of identity games .",
    "an identity game is a game in which , outside of certain pathological cases , no cell can change color . to avoid complications arising from these cases , the identity game is formally defined as follows :",
    "the * identity game * is a game in which , under at least some circumstances , cells have positive probability of living ; and in which no cell can change strategy , unless there are no living cells either to the left or right of it .",
    "the characterization is :    under the zero - depth model , a cellular game is the identity game if and only if the probability that a cell stays alive , if its strategy is different from at least one of its neighbors , is 1 .    _",
    "_ suppose a @xmath16 is a zero - depth cellular game of radius @xmath3 , with life probabilities fitting the above description .",
    "suppose a cell has living neighbors on each side .",
    "then either :    1 .",
    "a cell is not the same color / strategy as both of its neighbors .",
    "then it will stay alive .",
    "a cell @xmath19 is the same color as both of its neighbors , but has neighbors on both sides of different colors , the nearest ones being cells @xmath48 on the left and @xmath49 on the right",
    ". then cells @xmath50 and @xmath51 are alive .",
    "therefore , if @xmath19 dies , the left parent of @xmath19 will be cell @xmath50 , or a cell closer to @xmath19 ; and the right parent of @xmath19 will be cell @xmath51 , or a cell closer to @xmath19 .",
    "thus if @xmath19 dies , both parents will be the same color as @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose @xmath16 is such that there is positive probability a cell @xmath52 of color @xmath53 , next to a cell @xmath54 of color @xmath55 , may not live .",
    "let there be a configuration of cells giving positive life probability to the center cell .",
    "thus , since life probabilities are determined locally , it is possible that there may be living cells on either side of @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath52 die , and let it have living neighbors on each side .",
    "if either of these neighbors is not the same color as @xmath52 , then @xmath52 may change color ; if both are , @xmath54 will change color .    ' '' ''    finally , if cellular games , as described above , are intended to model living systems , two questions arise .",
    "first , why is a new strategy a symmetric function of the strategies of both parents , instead of , for example , being more influenced by the strategy of the nearest parent ?",
    "one answer is that this process is intended to model sexual reproduction , in which a gene has an equal possibility of coming from each parent .",
    "another is that if there is _ positive _ probability that each gene comes from each parent , the model may actually not behave very differently .",
    "future research may settle this question .",
    "the second question is , why nonlocality ?",
    "that is , why not say that if a cell has no living neighbors near enough , it just stays dead in the succeeding generation ?",
    "in this case , comparison with living ecosystems does suggest that locality is more appropriate , but with a very large radius .",
    "that is , suppose there is a large die - off of organisms in one particular area .",
    "then organisms from surrounding areas will rush in very fast , to fill the vacant area  but they can not rush in infinitely far in one generation . once again , future research may settle whether the simplified assumption , that is , nonlocality , actually creates different long - term behavior .",
    "the following theorem describes move behavior which results in optimal cell viability , for a whole ring of cells .",
    "it applies to all cellular games with a local life probability matrix ; that is , all games in which the probability a cell `` lives '' into the next generation is determined by its moves , and those of its neighbors less than a given number @xmath3 of units away .",
    "it thus applies to the arthur - packard - rogers model .",
    "however , it is here described in terms of the one - round model given in the previous chapter .",
    "[ ringviability ] the * ring viability * of a finite ring of cells @xmath56 running a one - round game @xmath16 , in generation @xmath9 , is the average life probability of these cells in that generation after moves are made , but before the life variables of the cells are actually set .",
    "since @xmath56 has finitely many cells , whose moves are from a specific finite alphabet , there is some combination of moves which will maximize this viability . for example , in a one - round version of the stag hunt game , ring viability will be maximized if all cells cooperate ; and , in some versions of the prisoner s dilemma , ring viability will be maximized if cells alternate between cooperation and defection .",
    "the result obtained is that this optimal arrangement is periodic .",
    "the following lemma is used in proving this :    [ defn ] lemma    [ l1 ] let @xmath16 be a one - round cellular game of radius @xmath3 , in which there are @xmath2 possible moves from some finite alphabet @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath57 be any string in @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 be the average life probability of all cells in a ring of @xmath60 cells , such that the move of the @xmath61th cell is the @xmath61th character of @xmath57 .",

    "cells making moves from @xmath62 are more than @xmath3 units away from cells making moves from @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , these cells can not influence each other s life probabilities . in the same way",
    ", @xmath55 is large enough so the life probabilities of cells making moves in either copy of @xmath55 can be influenced by cells making moves in @xmath62 , or in @xmath63 , but not by both .",
    "therefore the average life probability of all cells is the same as if they were considered to be in two different rings .    ' '' ''",
    "the main result follows :    [ rv ] let @xmath16 be a one - round cellular game as above .",

' '' ''    in the two - dimensional case , however , a result similar to theorem [ rv ] is false .",
    "that is , there are two - dimensional cellular games , for which no finite torus can achieve maximal torus viability .",
    "this is not shown directly , but is a corollary of results about wang tiles .",
    "a wang tile is a square tile with a specific color on each side .",
    "a set of wang tiles is a finite number of such tiles , along with rules for which colors can match .",
    "for example , a red edge may be put next to a blue edge , but not a white edge .",
    "such a set is said to tile the plane , if the entire plane can be covered by copies of tiles in the set , so that all edge matchings follow the rules .",
    "robert berger @xcite showed that there is a set of wang tiles that can tile the plane , but permit no periodic tiling .",
    "raphael robinson @xcite subsequently discovered another , smaller and simpler set of tiles that does the same thing .",
    "note that the set of tiles described by robinson admits an `` almost periodic '' tiling .",
    "that is , for any positive integer @xmath89 , the plane can be covered with these tiles periodically so that , under the given rules , the proportion of tiles having unmatching edges is less than @xmath90 .",
    "a two - dimensional cellular game can be made from a @xmath2- colored set of wang tiles as follows : let a cell be considered a tile ; let there be @xmath91 possible moves , and let these moves be considered direct products of the colors of the wang tiles . let the life probability of a cell be increased by @xmath92 for every match of a component of its move , with the corresponding component of the move of its neighbor .",
    "for example , @xmath92 would be added to the life probability of a cell , if the left component of its move were compatible to the right component of the move of its left neighbor .",
    "suppose a cellular game were made , in this manner , from the set of tiles described by robinson .",
    "then no torus could have viability one , because otherwise there would be a periodic tiling of the plane using these tiles . however , there are periodic tilings of the plane for which only an arbitrarily small proportion of the tiles have unmatching edges . therefore , since a periodic tiling of the plane can be considered a tiling of a torus , there are torus tilings having viability @xmath93 , for any @xmath94 .",
    "the comparison of cellular games and wang tilings suggests other possibilities for future research on tilings .",
    "for example , instead of a wang tiling in which two colors either match or not , one could consider a tiling in which two colors can partially match .",
    "this would correspond to a cellular game in which more than two different levels of success were possible .      in the preceding chapter",
    ", the concept of ring viability was discussed .",
    "that is , for each cellular game , there is some periodic combination of moves which maximizes average cell viability .",
    "one might assume that all cellular games would stabilize with cells exhibiting , or mostly exhibiting , such a combination of moves .",
    "if this assumption were true , questions about the long - term evolution of cellular games could be trivially resolved .    however , computer experiments suggest that this is not necessarily the case",
    ". that is , a one - round cellular game is simulated in which each cell plays the prisoner s dilemma with each of its neighbors .",

    "yet , computer experiments simulating this game do _ not _ show the mostly cooperative state to be stable . in the simulation depicted in figure [ fpris ] , a small number of defecting cells are put in the middle of a large ring of cooperators .",
    "the defecting strategy quickly takes over the ring .",
    "the reason for this is that , although defectors do badly against each other , they do extremely well against cooperators .",
    "thus , if a small zone of defecting cells is placed in a large ring of cooperating cells , the area between the leftmost and rightmost defecting cells tends to expand .    to address such questions more formally",
    ", we use the concept of a domain :    [ domain ] a * domain * is a contiguous row of same - colored cells .",
    "we would like to examine what happens when a small defecting domain is placed between two very large cooperating domains .",
    "is the number of defecting cells in the vicinity of that domain likely to go up , or down ?",
    "if it is more likely to go up , we can reasonably say that cooperative behavior is not stable under invasion .    of course",
    ", conceivably , each strategy could be unstable under invasion by the other ; that is , there could be a tendency for large domains of each color to break up into smaller ones .",

    "first , we use theorem [ mix00 ] , presented below , a result which applies both to cellular games and other stochastic processes .",
    "this theorem implies that if a simple cellular game evolves as above , and if , under any conditions , the probability this zone will `` glide '' arbitrarily far to the left is positive , there are initial conditions under which this probability can be made as high as desired ; that is , greater than @xmath166 , for any @xmath94 .",

    "since the negative black cells are themselves acting as a glider , it can be shown that they will not interfere with the behavior of cells in the positive area .",
    "it is in this part of the proof that the left / right symmetry comes in ; it is used to show that gliders can move in both directions .    since this right - traveling glider continues to contain two or more cells , we are able again to avoid counting cases twice .",
    "that is , each case is assigned to the last generation in which there is exactly one nonnegative black cell .",

    "note that if this conjecture is true , it can be shown that under both finite and standard restricted initial conditions , no finite domain @xmath112 ( with probability @xmath1 ) will grow arbitrarily large .",

    "since @xmath112 will grow arbitrarily large , each of these gliders could be shown not to be affected by what happens on the other side of @xmath112 .",
    "they could thus be considered to be `` gliding '' arbitrarily far in one direction , between two infinite domains . by theorem [ main ] ( the double glider theorem )",
    ", this is not possible if the two domains are the same color ; and , if the above conjecture is true , this would not be possible if the two domains are different colors .      at this point",
    ", one may ask if either mixing processes or clumping processes exist .",
    "computer simulations suggest that both kinds of behavior are indeed possible .",

    "the life probability of a cell is one value , @xmath441 , if it is the same color as both of its neighbors , and a different value , @xmath442 , otherwise .",
    "these games are thus both left / right and black / white symmetric .",
    "let such games be called `` join / mix '' processes .    using the definition of simple cellular game , these processes can be specified more formally as follows :    * there is one cell for each integer , or each integer mod @xmath2 . * in each generation , each cell is either white or black . *",
    "if a cell is the same color as both of its neighbors , its probability of living in that generation is @xmath443 .",

    "if , in generation @xmath9 , a cell has no living neighbors on each side , it has a @xmath237 probability of assuming either color in generation @xmath10 .    in computer experiments ,",
    "games of this type are run on a circular lattice of cells .",
    "initially , two black domains are placed in a mostly white area .",
    "figure [ square ] shows how results vary as @xmath441 and @xmath442 vary .",
    "that is , if @xmath441 is high , there seems to be little noise at the borders between domains . in such cases",
    ", @xmath442 determines the rate of domain movement .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath441 is low and @xmath442 high , the noise between domains seems to grow so fast it quickly takes over the ring .",
    "if @xmath441 and @xmath442 are both low , the asymptotic behavior of the process is not readily apparent .",
    "however , the resemblance to natural structures is noticeable .",
    "the join / mix game such that @xmath445 and @xmath446 is called the the * join or die process*.    the process is given this name because a cell must join ; that is , be the same color as both of its neighbors , or else it is very likely to die .",
    "computer simulations suggest that the join or die process is , in fact , a clumping process .",
    "that is , the area of `` noise '' between two large domains appears to stay , quite small most of the time .",
    "we thus conjecture :    the join or die process is a clumping process .",
    "that is , if it evolves under standard restricted initial conditions , the zone of uncertainty will almost always become empty infinitely many times .    now , consider what happens , under the join or die or other clumping processes , to `` normal '' or `` almost all '' initial conditions .",
    "let us suppose that average domain size will , almost always , grow arbitrarily large . thus , after many generations , most cells in any given section of the lattice would , most likely , be in extremely large domains ; and a visual depiction of this section would show large domains , with a noisy boundary between them ( consisting of small domains , many containing no living cells ) .",
    "the noisy boundary between two such large domains would , therefore , move in some sort of symmetric random walk ; and it might be unlikely that the noise in the boundary would grow to significant size , compared to the domains it bordered .    thus , the evolution of such a process might be very similar to that of a process in which the size of the `` noise '' between domains stayed bounded . let us suppose , without loss of generality , that the size of the `` noise '' stayed at one cell .",
    "let us describe such a model ( which is _ not _ a cellular game )",
    "as follows :    * there is one cell for each integer .",
    "* each cell , at each time , is in either a black , white , or gray state .",
    "* gray domains , which may be no more than one cell wide , are called `` particles .",
    "'' particles separate black and white domains , which alternate .",
    "* particles move either to the right or left , in accordance with some symmetric random walk . *",
    "if two particles meet or cross , then two white domains have absorbed a black domain ( or two black domains a white one ) .",
    "thus , these two particles , which represent the boundaries between two domains , disappear .",
    "this is , exactly , a stochastic process discovered by erds and ney @xcite and called the _ annihilating particle model_. and , computer simulations do , indeed , show apparent similarities of behavior .",
    "these similarities suggest that study of one subject may shed light on the other .",
    "another join / mix game is the mixing process .    the join / mix game such that @xmath447 and @xmath448 is called the the * mixing process*.    that is , the probabilities are exactly reversed from those used for the join or die process . as this process evolves , computer experiments suggest that the `` noise '' between two large domains is likely to grow with time .",
    "[ cmix ] the mixing process is a mixing process .",
    "that is , if it evolves under standard restricted initial conditions , the zone of uncertainty will almost always grow arbitrarily large .",
    "all computer experiments were done in turbo pascal , version 4.0 , using the built - in pseudorandom number generator .",
    "source code is available from levine@symcom.math.uiuc.edu .",
    "the program simulating the modified arthur - packard - rogers model , with stag hunt parameters , is cg2.pas .",
    "note that in this program all strategies are mixed ; that is , there is a small probability of actions other than those called for by the pure strategy .",
    "the simulations of zero - depth , one - round models are as follows : in section [ cgm ] : the cloud process , cloud.pas , the prisoner s dilemma , prisoner.pas , the stag hunt ( first version ) , stag.pas , and the stag hunt ( second version ) , stag2.pas . in section [ tss ] : the square of different join / mix processes , square.pas , the join or die process , jd.pas , the annihilating particle model , apm.pas , and the mixing process , mix.pas .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma is a two - person game in which two types of moves are possible : cooperate , and defect .",
    "this game models the options of two prisoners held in separate cells for the same crime , who are being pressured to confess to that crime .",
    "if both prisoners keep silent  that is , they cooperate with each other  they will both get a small sentence for a lesser crime . if they both talk  that is , they both defect  they both get the standard sentence .",
    "if one talks and the other does not , the one that kept silent gets a very severe sentence and the other goes free .",
    "thus , prisoner s dilemma is a game in which a player s reward for defecting , while the other player cooperates , is highest .",
    "next highest is the reward for mutual cooperation ; then , the reward for mutual defection .",
    "lowest of all is the reward for cooperating while the other player defects .",
    "the prisoner s dilemma can also be generalized to three - person games . for more information on the prisoner s",
    "dilemma , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the computer experiments presented in [ apr ] use a model very similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "that is , there exists a circular ring , or doubly infinite lattice , of cells @xmath56 .",
    "associated with each cell @xmath19 , in each round @xmath61 of each generation @xmath9 , are :    * a move variable @xmath449 from some finite alphabet @xmath44 of @xmath2 characters .",

    "there are hence @xmath452 possible strategies .",
    "note that strategies do not change in a generation , but they do take into account rounds in previous generations . in computer experiments , move and strategy variables are initialized with the aid of a pseudorandom number generator . + a finite number of _ mixed _ , that is , stochastic , strategies may also be implemented ; that is , strategies in which , given at least one game history , there is positive probability of a cell making two different moves . for example",
    ", a mixed strategy for prisoner s dilemma would be to cooperate @xmath453 of the time , and defect the other @xmath454 .",
    "if a given game allows @xmath2 moves , and @xmath315 mixed courses of action , there are @xmath455 possible strategies . again , mixed strategies , and all other stochastic actions , are implemented with the aid of a generator . *",
    "a reward , or payoff , variable @xmath456 .",
    "this variable starts out at @xmath0 in the first round of each generation , and its change in each round measures the success of a cell in that round .",
    "changes to the reward variable are determined by a matrix @xmath16 .",
    "this matrix defines the game and does not change during its course .",

    ", a fixed number of rounds @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xmath468 rounds ) , is regarded as constituting a generation .",
    "after each generation , cell strategies change , as follows :    * the probability of a cell `` living '' into the next generation , is an increasing function of the size of its reward variable .",
    "usually the reward matrix contains only positive entries , and life probability is proportional to the size of the reward variable of a cell . *",
    "a live cell keeps its strategy in the next generation .",
    "* a cell that does not live is given a new strategy in the next generation .",
    "this strategy is chosen as follows :    * new entries in the strategy table are taken from corresponding entries in either one of the two _ parent _ cells ( the nearest living neighbors of a cell on each side ) .",
