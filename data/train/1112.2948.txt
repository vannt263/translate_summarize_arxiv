    "unlike blazars and the galactic sources ( e.g. snrs ) , which composite the most population of tev sources , m87 is the first discovered radio galaxy with tev radiation .",
    "recently three other radio galaxies centaurus a , 3c66b and ic310 were also identified as tev sources @xcite . comparing to blazars",
    ", m87 has much milder variations in both optical and x - ray band ; most importantly , the prominent kpc - scale jet of m87 has a very large viewing angle @xmath3 with respect to the line of sight @xcite . in 2005 , rapid tev variation ( @xmath4days ) was discovered with flat spectrum for the first time , but without correlated x - ray variation from the nuclear core @xcite . while in 2008 , the radio , x - ray , tev joint observation discovered that tev flares lasts 2 weeks accompanied with an x - ray flare and a radio flare inside the unresolved nuclear core ( @xmath5 ) as well as with a radio blob moving out of the unresolved core @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 used in the vlba observations are based on the black hole ( bh ) mass of m87 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , a tev flare in 2010 which is very similar to the previous tev flares in 2005 and 2008 was reported .",
    "further observations at x - rays and radio find the correlated x - ray flare , but no enhanced radio flux from the core @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath8 @xcite to be consistent with the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models and the mini - jet models in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "although m87 has a large viewing angle , it is very near to the earth with a distance of @xmath9mpc . owing to its proximity",
    ", it is proposed that m87 might be a misaligned blazar @xcite . whereas blazars are believed to have jets beaming towards us ,",
    "tev sources in m87 could be shocks with relativistic bulk velocity inside the jets .",
    "recent observed minute - scale variation from galaxies like mrk 421 ( fossati et al .",
    "2008 ) and pks 2155 - 304 @xcite indicates that tev sources should be compact and very close to the bh . comparing to the tev flares of blazars , the slower variation ( @xmath4 day ) detected in m87 could be the results of too few observed tev photons ( each data point requires integration of photons for the whole night ) or the much lower doppler factor of the bulk velocity of the tev sources due to the large inclination .",
    "furthermore , unlike the steeper tev spectrum of blazars , the much flatter tev spectrum of m87 could be mainly due to the lack of @xmath0 absorption",
    ". the large viewing angle may play an important role in avoiding @xmath0 absorption within the jet ; thanks to its proximity and the dimness of its host galaxy , the absorption to tev photon from m87 caused by the galactic and the intergalactic background soft photons , as well as the cosmic background photons is rather weak @xcite .    to explain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the nucleus of m87 , the one zone synchrotron self - compton(ssc ) models , which have been applied to the tev flares in blazars , face difficulties in fitting the two peaks in the sed",
    ", however , in the multi - zone ssc models , the tev source is separated from the soft ones , therefore the whole sed could be easily fitted as long as there are enough ssc blobs with specific locations , electron distributions and bulk velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the multi - zone ssc models could also provide better explanation for the rapid variation , and the orphan tev flares ( the variations in the soft band can not connect with the tev variation ) .",
    "furthermore , considering the very flat power - law sed of m87 in the tev band with index @xmath10 , the @xmath0 absorption provides crucial constrains on the ssc models .",
    "so far , most of the ssc models still have problems in explaining the very flat tev spectrum due to the certain @xmath0 absorption , therefore the external inverse compton ( eic ) process could be more likely responsible for the tev flare @xcite . in the eic models ,",
    "the tev source is far away from the soft one , or has the relativistic bulk velocity with respect to the soft one , thus the @xmath0 absorption can be reduced .    in those models mentioned above ,",
    "how the very high energy ( vhe ) particles are produced is still an open question .",
    "it is generally believed that vhe particles are accelerated by the shocks in jets .",
    "there are some other possibilities include the mini - jets powered via the magnetic reconnection in the main jet ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; the magnetic centrifugal acceleration in the vicinity of bh @xcite , and so on . in the mini - jets model @xcite , magnetic reconnection within the main jet produces two oppositely directed ( in the rest frame of the main jet ) mini - jets , in the laboratory frame",
    ", one of them always points within the angle of the main jet and is observable in blazars because their jets point at us .",
    "the other mini - jet ( its counterpart ) points outside the opening angle of the main jet and is potentially observable to off - axis observers in case of the misaligned jets , such as those of m87 and centaurus a. in a word , the great advantage of the mini - jets model is that even at large inclination , mini - jets with a high bulk speed can still be detected , which is helpful for explanation of the fast tev variation from m87 .",
    "after all , in order to avoid the @xmath0 absorption , the energy density of the soft synchrotron photons in the tev source must be limited , therefore , the minimal lorentz factor of the vhe particles is generally assumed to be @xmath11 and the strength of the magnetic field in the tev source below several gauss @xcite . beside the direct inverse compton process of the vhe electrons , there are also some alternative models to produce the sed of the tev flares , such as the hadronic models including , among which , the interaction between the vhe protons and soft photons and the proton - proton collision process when a red giant was passing the base of the jet @xcite .    in this paper , we develop a fully general relativity eic model for explaining the tev emission from m87 , in which the soft photons emanate from the adaf around the bh . in  2 , we investigate the safe zone of tev photons ( the @xmath0 optical depth is below unity ) .",
    "the technical details of our fully general relativity eic model can be found in  3 .",
    "the numerical results and the discussions are given in  4 and  5 , respectively .     or",
    "@xmath12 in the @xmath13 plane . where @xmath14 represents the distance to the bh in the boyer - lindquist frame .",
    "the viewing angle is taken to be @xmath15 .",
    "the blank region in the lower panels is the region with @xmath16 .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "the rapid tev variation of m87 ( @xmath17 days ) found both in 2005 , 2008 and 2010 indicates that the tev photons should come from a compact source very close to the black hole ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the doppler factor of the source ) .",
    "especially the tev flare in 2008 , which is accompanied with a radio flare , lies inside the unresolved region and there is a radio blob moving outwards .",
    "again , this indicates that the tev source might be near to the bh and its distance might be less than @xmath20 @xcite .    as mentioned above , beside the constrains from the vlba radio image and the variation time scale of the tev emission",
    ", the background soft photons could also lay strong constrains on the location of the tev sources , in consideration of the @xmath0 absorption . both the tev flares in 2005 , 2008 and 2010 had shown very flat power - law spectrum ( @xmath21 tev ) strongly suggesting quite weak @xmath0 absorption .",
    "therefore , the eic process seems to be a more plausible mechanism to produce the flat tev spectrum , while the ssc models suffer from certain @xmath0 absorption @xcite . even in the eic models ,",
    "if the source of soft photons is from a homogeneously isotropic blob whose size is about @xmath22 and infrared luminosity is about @xmath23erg / s , the location of the tev sources could be still limited to be no deeper than @xmath24 inside that blob .",
    "the observed soft photons from m87 could be mainly either from the disk or from the outflow / jet . according to the vlbi observations of m87",
    ", its jet is well known with a large inclination",
    ". however , the base of the jet seems to have a large opening angle ( @xmath25 inside the region @xmath26 , @xcite ) , therefore the jet might contribute to the observed soft emission .",
    "due to the slight variation of the observed flux of soft photons ( from radio to x - ray ) from m87 nucleus , here we suggest that the observed soft photons are mainly from the accretion disk around the central black hole as in li et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    by applying the adaf model to the nuclear emission of m87 , li et al .",
    "( 2009 ) obtained the accretion rate of adaf in m87 , generally consistent with the previous estimate of the bondi accretion rate from the chandra x - ray observation ( di matteo et al .",
    "they then calculated optical depth of the radiation fields from the adaf to tev photons due to @xmath27 absorption .",
    "the resultant optical depth suggests that the location of tev sources should be larger than @xmath28 , in order to avoid the significant @xmath27 absorption to a 10 tev photon @xcite .",
    "here we try to map a more detailed safe zone ( @xmath29 ) for tev photons in the vicinity of bh . as in @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the optical depth ( @xmath30 ) to 10 tev photons emanating from vicinity of the central bh in the kerr spacetime .",
    "the tev photons move outwards along their geodesic trajectories and reach the observer s sky at points described by the impact parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively represent the displacement of the image perpendicular to the projection of the rotation of the black hole on the sky and the displacement parallel to the projection of the axis ( see e.g. fig",
    ". 1 of li et al .",
    "the resultant contour of @xmath30 as a function of the location of the tev sources for @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the @xmath35 plane can be obtained ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is obvious that the larger the spin @xmath36 , the deeper the safe zone .",
    "for instance , for @xmath37 , the safe zone can reach even to @xmath38 along some trajectories of 10tev photons , the reason is that for larger bh spin , the infrared - uv radiation is concentrated in the inner disk .",
    "therefore , the colliding angle between the soft photons and the tev photons in the mini - jets is smaller , significantly reducing the @xmath0 absorption . besides , in the panels of @xmath39 , the asymmetricity is caused by the rotation of the disk and the viewing angle(@xmath15 ) of the observer . while in the panels of @xmath37",
    ", since the disk become a more compact source of soft photons , the asymmetricity caused by the disk become weaker .",
    "in our eic model , following @xcite , the mini - jets powered by magnetic energy in the jet correspond to be the tev sources . for a clarity , we present the details of the model in what follows .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the main jet is estimated as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the magnetic strength , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 erg / s ) is the observed isotropic power of the jet of m87 @xcite , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the cross sectional area of the jet , @xmath46 is the ratio of the magnetization energy to the kinetic energy of the main jet , @xmath47 is the lorentz factor of the main jet , and @xmath48 is the light speed .",
    "although the inclination of the jet is about @xmath49 , the mini - jets ( blobs of plasma with characteristic lorentz factor @xmath50 at angle @xmath51 with respect to the jet in the jet rest frame ) are capable of beaming towards us with a high bulk velocity @xmath52 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the mini - jets in the jet rest frame is about @xmath53 , which corresponds to the alfvn speed of the plasma in the jet .",
    "the characteristic thermal lorenz factor of the electrons in the mini - jets rest frame is about @xmath54 .",
    "the energy distribution of the high energy electrons is assumed to be @xmath55 where @xmath56 . in our canonical model , @xmath47 is taken to be 5 , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , if the mini - jets are beaming toward us ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the original mini - jets model of @xcite .      in our eic model , we assume that the soft photons are from the accretion disk and the tev source ( mini - jets ) is located along the major axis of jet with a height @xmath59 above the central black hole . to investigate the eic process",

    ", we investigate the compton scattering of the soft photons from the disk by the vhe electrons in the mini - jets ( as shown in fig .",

    "should be determined first ; then the local emergent spectra @xmath60 at the radius @xmath61 in the rest frame of the fluid can be calculated .",
    "using the ray - tracing technique , the observed sed can be obtained to fit the multi - wavelength observations of m87 .",

    "after determining the radiation energy density of the soft photons @xmath89 at the colliding points , the direction of motion of the vhe electrons which produce the observed tev photons is needed to calculate the tev spectra .",

    "unfortunately , during the 2005 tev flares , there is no accompanied hst observation of m87 . with the better sensitivity of cta ( it is about @xmath17410 times better than those of the present cerenkov telescopes ) , we will be able to detect the fainter flares and obtain the minimal variation time scale of the tev flares , which increases the opportunity of finding the correlated variation between ir - uv and tev emission .    in our models , with little @xmath0 absorption , all the eic spectra at the observational band",
    "have inherited the original power - law index of the vhe electrons .",
    "after fitting those spectra , we calculate the cooling time of the vhe electrons in the mini - jets ( see section 4 ) to make sure that they would not travel longer than @xmath175 .",
    "it turns out when tev source is located at @xmath176 , the ic cooling time is very much shorter than the upper - limits of the observed tev variation of 1 - 2 days .",
    "therefore , if possibly , the tev source is located further away from the disk ( @xmath177 ) , the cooling efficiency of the vhe electrons in the mini - jets is much lower , the mini - jets could move out of the main jet . as a result",
    ", the variation of the soft radiation background at the different locations above the disk should be considered .",
    "we also discuss the probability that the direct synchrotron radiation from the mini - jets may cause the correlated x - ray flare in 2008 . as expected , according to our model , if the magnetic field is about several gauss , the direct synchrotron flux from these mini - jets which lies at the x - ray band can explain the x - ray flare very well but has no influence on the observed radiation at the gev - tev band",
    ". however , the magnetic field @xmath178 can not be constrained by any direct observation , as discussed above , and we only have a rough estimate of the strength of the magnetic field supposed to be consistent with the mini - jets model . considering that the synchrotron flux is roughly about @xmath179 ,",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath164 and @xmath178 are degenerated .",
    "if the tev source is confined inside the region @xmath180 , the corresponding strength of the magnetic field is required to be about @xmath181 , in order to produce the x - ray flare in 2008 .",
    "dealing with the two weeks data of the 2008 flare from magic , albert et al .",
    "( 2008 ) had separated the high state data ( @xmath182 1 day time scale ) from the low state data and they found that during the high states , the spectra are harder : the spectrum index of the high state is about 2.2 , while that of the low state is about 2.6 . because the ic cooling time and the synchrotron cooling time of vhe particles is short , the observed fastest variation should be dominated by the time of the acceleration , or even the shifting of the beaming angle of the mini - jets . if there is no continuous acceleration of the relativistic electrons , the spectra of the tev flares will become steeper . in the year of 2008 , veritas captured the tev flare ( feb 9 - 13 , 2008 ) which is close to the date of the x - ray flare ( feb 16 , 2008 ) .",
    "veritas observation shows that the spectrum index of the tev flare is about 2.4 , which is softer than the earlier flares captured by magic @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the tev flare captured by veritas is happening during the rapid synchrotron cooling of the relativistic electrons in the mini - jet , and the x - ray flare could be a byproduct of that tev flare , as the x - ray flares in 2008 .",
    "our suggestion could naturally explain the x - ray excess and the softer spectrum of tev emission .",
    "there are two ways to check above suggestion : first , the flux of the x - ray via synchrotron radiation should be anti - correlated with the tev flux via eic , which could be tested by the future observations with the higher time resolution ( less than 1 day ) ; second , and the tev flare should share the similar spectrum index with that of the x - ray flare . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the pile up effect of x - ray observation @xcite , we can not obtain the correct spectrum index of the x - ray flare .",
