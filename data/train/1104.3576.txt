    "a detailed understanding of the milky way , from its formation and subsequent evolution , to its present - day structural characteristics , remains key to understanding the cosmic processes that shape galaxies .",
    "to achieve such a goal , one needs access to multi - dimensional phase space information , rather than restricted ( projected ) properties - for example , the three components of the positions and the three components of the velocity vectors for a given sample of stars .",
    "until a decade ago , only the position on the sky and the proper motion vector was known for most of the local stars .",
    "thanks to esa s hipparcos satellite @xcite , the distance to more than @xmath3 stars within a few hundred parsecs has been measured , allowing one to recover precise positions in the local volume ( a sphere roughly 100  pc in radius centered on the sun ) .",
    "however , the @xmath4 dimension of the phase space was still missing until recently , when @xcite and @xcite released radial velocities for subsamples of respectively @xmath5 dwarfs and @xmath6 giants from the hipparcos catalog .    in recent years , with the availability of multi - object spectrometers mounted on large field - of - view telescopes , two projects aiming at measuring the missing dimension have been initiated : rave and segue , the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration .",
    "segue uses the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) instrumentation and acquired spectra for @xmath7 faint stars , @xmath8 , in 212 regions sampling three quarters of the sky .",
    "the moderate resolution spectrograph ( r@xmath9 ) combined with coverage of a large spectral domain ( @xmath10   ) allows one to reach a radial velocity accuracy of @xmath11 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 at @xmath14 as well as an estimate of stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the segue catalog was released as part of the sdss - dr7 and is described in @xcite .",
    "altogether , the sdss - i and ii projects provide spectra for about @xmath15 stars in the milky way . as of january 2011 , the sdss data release 8 marks the first release of the sdss - iii survey @xcite .",
    "this release @xcite provides @xmath16 more spectra from the segue-2 survey targeting stars in the milky way .",
    "rave commenced observations in 2003 and has thus far released two catalogs : dr1 in 2006 and dr2 in 2008 @xcite , hereafter papers i and ii , respectively .",
    "the survey targets bright stars compared to segue , @xmath17 , in the southern celestial hemisphere , making the two surveys complementary .",
    "the rave catalogs contain respectively @xmath18 and @xmath19 measurements of radial velocities plus stellar parameter estimates for about half the catalog for dr2 .",
    "rave uses the 6df facility on the anglo - australian observatory s schmidt telescope in siding spring , australia .",
    "this instrument allows one to collect up to 150 spectra simultaneously at an effective resolution of @xmath20 in a 385   wide spectral interval around the near - infrared calcium triplet ( @xmath21   ) .",
    "the caii triplet being a strong feature , rave can measure radial velocities with a median precision of about @xmath22 .",
    "rave is designed to study the signatures of hierarchical galaxy formation in the milky way and more specifically the origin of phase space structures in the disk and inner galactic halo . within this framework",
    ", @xcite discovered the aquarius stream , while @xcite studied the net vertical flux of stars at the solar radius and showed that no dense streams with an orbit perpendicular to the galactic plane exist in the solar neighborhood , supporting the revised orbit of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite looked directly at stellar streams in dr1 within 500  pc of the sun and identified a stream candidate on an extreme radial orbit ( the kfr08 stream ) , in addition to three previously known phase space structures ( see also * ? ? ? * for an analysis of known moving groups ) .",
    "a later analysis of the dr2 catalog by the same authors , using the newly available stellar atmospheric parameters in the catalog , revised their detection of the kfr08 stream , the stream being now only marginally detected @xcite .    if rave is designed to look at cosmological signatures in the milky way , it is also well - suited to address more general questions .",
    "for example , @xcite used the high velocity stars in the rave catalog to revise the local escape speed , refining the estimate of the total mass of the milky way .",
    "@xcite used rave to revise the motion of the sun with respect to the lsr , while @xcite measured the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid at 1  kpc below the galactic plane . @xcite",
    "combined rave , ucac2 , and 2mass data towards the galactic poles to revisit the thin - thick disk decomposition and @xcite used rave spectra to confirm the existence of the @xmath23 diffuse interstellar band and its correlation with extinction .",
    "rave , being a randomly - selected , magnitude - limited survey , possesses content representative of the milky way for the specific magnitude interval , in addition to peculiar and rare objects within the same interval .",
    "together , this makes rave a particularly useful catalog to study the origin of the milky way s stellar populations .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the elemental abundances of a sample of metal - poor stars from rave to show that direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies probably did not play a major role in the formation of the thick disk , a finding corroborated by the study of the eccentricity distribution of a thick disc sample from rave @xcite . also , @xcite used rave to study double lined binaries using rave spectra while @xcite used rave to detect very metal poor stars in the milky way",
    ". it also happens that bright objects from nearby local group galaxies are observed ; @xcite , for example , identified eight luminous blue variables from the large magellanic cloud in the rave sample .",
    "so far rave has released only radial velocities and stellar atmospheric parameters . to really gain access to the full 6d phase space ,",
    "the distance to the stars remains a missing , yet important , parameter , unless one focuses on a particular class of stars , such as red clump stars ( see for examples * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "combining the photometric magnitude from 2mass and rave stellar atmospheric parameters , @xcite derived the 6d coordinates for 16,000 stars from the rave dr2 , allowing a detailed investigation of the structure of the milky way .",
    "this effort of providing distances for rave targets was later improved by @xcite , taking advantage of stellar evolution constraints , and by @xcite , by using the bayesian approach described in @xcite .",
    "the distance estimates have been used by @xcite to detect non - axisymmetric motions in the galactic disk .",
    "these works will be extended to dr3 , distributed in a separate catalog , and will provide a unique sample to study the details of the formation of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , for the bright part of the rave sample , the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel allows one to estimate fairly accurate elemental abundances from the rave spectra .",
    "this catalog containing of order 10@xmath24 stars ( boeche et al .",
    ", in prep ) will provide a unique opportunity to combine dynamical and chemical analyses to understand our galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present the 3@xmath25 data release of the rave project , releasing the radial velocity data and stellar atmospheric parameters of the pilot survey program that were collected during the first three years of operation , therefore dr3 includes the data collected for dr1 and dr2 .",
    "the spectra are not part of this release .",
    "these data were processed using a new version of the processing pipeline .",
    "this paper follows the first and second data releases described in papers i and ii .",
    "the pilot survey release is the last release relying on the original input catalog , based on the tycho-2 and supercosmos surveys .",
    "subsequent rave releases will be based on targets selected from the denis survey i - band .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ s : pipeline ] presents the new version of the processing pipeline which calculates the radial velocities and estimates the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "section  [ s : validation ] presents the validation of the new data , as well as the updated calibration relation for metallicity , while section  [ s : catalog ] describes the dr3 catalog .",
    "in papers i and ii we described in detail the processing pipeline used to compute the radial velocities and the stellar atmospheric parameters , making use of a best - matched template to measure the radial velocities and set the atmospheric parameters reported in the catalog .",
    "this pipeline performs adequately for well - behaved spectra , permitting the measurement of precise radial velocities , and we showed in paper ii that the stellar atmospheric parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 can be estimated .",
    "however , to compare the rave @xmath28 to high resolution measurements @xmath29 refers to the metallicity obtained using the rave pipeline while @xmath29 refers to metallicity obtained using detailed analyses of high resolution echelle spectra .",
    "] , a calibration relation must be used .",
    "also , in the case where a rave spectrum suffers from ( small ) defects , the stellar atmospheric parameters are less well - constrained .",
    "we therefore set out to improve the pipeline , while still maintaining its underlying computational techniques .",
    "this section reviews the modifications of the rave pipeline , which is otherwise fully described in paper ii .      the rave pipeline for dr1 and dr2 relied on the @xcite synthetic spectra library based on atlas  9 model atmospheres .",
    "this library contains spectra with three different values for the micro - turbulence @xmath30 of 1 , 2 , and @xmath31 .",
    "however , the library is well - populated only for the @xmath32 value , about @xmath33 spectra having @xmath34 or @xmath31 , compared to @xmath35 having @xmath32 .    for this new data release ( dr3 ) ,",
    "new synthetic spectra for intermediate metallicities were added in order to provide a more realistic spacing towards the densest region of the observed parameter space and so remove biases towards low metallicity .",
    "the new grid has @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47dex .",
    "we also restricted the library to @xmath32 , discarding all other micro - turbulence values .",
    "this does not impact the quality of the measured stellar parameters as , at our  level and resolution , we are unable to constrain the micro - turbulence , and the pipeline usually converges on the most common micro - turbulence value in the library ( @xmath32 ) .    furthermore , since the nominal resolution of the 6df instrument does not allow us to measure precisely the rotational velocity of the star , we chose to restrict the @xmath48 dimension , removing six of the lower @xmath49 values ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) , retaining only the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and higher , velocities .    removing one dimension of the parameter space and reducing the rotational velocity dimension helps to stabilize the solution and allows us to lower the number of neighboring spectra used for the fit .",
    "we lower this number from 300 to 150 . as for paper ii",
    ", the laplace multipliers for the penalisation terms were set using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we increased the laplace multiplier handling the penalisation on the sum of the weights , which constrains the level of the continuum to unity for continuum normalized spectra , as a @xmath59% offset was not uncommon in the previous pipeline .      to date , the processing pipeline used  estimates as described in paper i. however , this  estimate tends to underestimate the true  and is less dependent on the true noise than it is on the weather conditions or spectrum defects , such as fringing ( see paper ii ) . in paper ii , a new estimate , s2n , was presented based on the best fit template but was not used by the pipeline as it was an _ a posteriori _ estimate .",
    "we showed that s2n is closer to the true .",
    "because of the new continuum correction procedure ( see section  [ s : normalisation ] ) , the   must be computed correctly before the continuum correction is applied .",
    "therefore , it must be known prior to the processing .",
    "we thus developed an algorithm to measure the  of a spectrum in which no flux information is used .",
    "this new  estimate , stn , is obtained using the observed spectrum ( no continuum normalization applied ) as follows :    * smooth the observed spectrum @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the pixel index , to produce a smoothed spectrum @xmath62 .",
    "this smoothing is done with a smoothing box three pixels long . *",
    "compute the residual vector @xmath63 and its rms @xmath64 . *",
    "remove from @xmath65 pixels that diverge from @xmath66 by more than @xmath67 .",
    "* smooth the clipped spectrum as above to form a new smoothed spectrum @xmath66 and repeat the clipping process until convergence . *",
    "compute the local standard deviation @xmath68 using pixels @xmath69 and @xmath70 . *",
    "compute stn@xmath71 .",
    "the factor of 1.62 is set using numerical realizations of a poisson noise .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure  [ f : snr ] ,  and stn are on a 1:1 relation .",
    "however , in a real spectrum , instrument noise also contributes to the residuals and we expect an additional normalization factor .",
    "the s2n value as computed in paper ii follows closely the true . hence , to assess the validity of the stn measurement",
    ", we compared it to the s2n in paper ii ( figure  [ f : snr ] right panel ) . a correction factor of 0.58 for s2n is found to produce a 1:1 relation between the two measurements , a correction that we apply in the pipeline .          in the low   regime ( @xmath72 ) , the metallic lines are no longer visible . in this case ,",
    "@xmath28 measurements converge to the highest allowed value ( @xmath73  dex ) which gives the lowest possible @xmath74 value , i.e. the algorithm fits the noise . in this regime ,",
    "the stellar parameters are not reliable and are therefore not published . in the intermediate regime @xmath75 , a correlation between @xmath28 and  is observed in the rave data .",
    "while some of the above correlation is understood and arises from the change of the underlying stellar content as one moves further away from the plane and the  simultaneously decreases , some part of this correlation arises from to the continuum normalization failing to recover the proper continuum level .",
    "the former pipeline uses the iraf continuum task with asymmetric rejection parameters ( @xmath76 for the low rejection level and @xmath77 for the high rejection level ) .",
    "while these parameters are well - suited for the high   regime ( @xmath78 ) , at low  they tend to produce an estimated continuum that is too high .",
    "this is due to the routine considering the spikes below the continuum as spectral lines when , in fact , they are mainly due to noise .",
    "we ameliorate this problem by using a low rejection value that is a function of",
    ". this rejection level must be close to @xmath79 for high  spectra and larger for low s / n .",
    "numerical tests indicate that using the following formula    @xmath80    with @xmath81 , from the top left panel of figure  [ f : continuum ] , reduces significantly the continuum normalization problem .",
    "the top panels in figure  [ f : continuum ] show the mean residual between the observed continuum - normalized spectra and best fit template as a function of , before and after the change in the low rejection level , while the bottom panels present the resulting distributions of @xmath28 as a function of .",
    "the new continuum normalization reduces significantly the correlation between metallicity and , while no trend in the residual as a function of  remains .",
    "this indicates that the new continuum normalization algorithm performs adequately , although a weak correlation is still seen in the metallicity versus  ( @xmath82dex per 100 in )",
    ".    observed spectra for 4,684 rave spectra as a function of .",
    "bottom panels : @xmath28 distributions as a function of .",
    "the left columns are for the previous version of the continuum normalization algorithm while the right column includes the low rejection level being a function of .",
    "the gain from the new continuum normalization is clear from these figures : the correlation between metallicity and  is strongly reduced , while the residuals do not show any correlation with .",
    "the thick black line represents the stn limit below which atmospheric parameters are not published in the rave catalog.,width=566 ]      approximately 20% of rave spectra suffer from defects such as fringing or residual cosmic rays , which can not be removed by the automatic procedure we use to reduce our data . while residual cosmic rays do not affect the determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters ( these are similar to emission lines , which are not taken into account in the template library ) , fringing results in poor local continuum normalization , leading to inaccurate parameter recovery .",
    "regions strongly affected by fringing are difficult to detect prior to the processing , but we can make use of the best fit template to estimate whether a spectrum suffers from such a continuum distortion and therefore whether the atmospheric parameter determination is likely to be in error .    to estimate the fraction of a spectrum contaminated by continuum distortions , we compute the reduced @xmath83 along the spectrum in a box 21 pixels wide centered on the pixel @xmath61 .",
    "we then also compute the mean difference @xmath84 between the best - fit template and the observed spectrum in the same box . if @xmath85 and @xmath86 , a systematic difference between the template and the observed spectrum exists .",
    "the corresponding region of the spectrum is then flagged as a defect .",
    "the fraction of good pixels in each spectrum is then recorded and given in the rave catalog ( see maskflag in table  [ t : a1 ] ) . from visual inspection , we find that when the number of bad pixels is larger than 30% then the spectrum is problematic and the stellar parameters should be treated with caution .",
    "figure  [ f : badcontinuum ] shows different examples of real rave spectra where a significant fraction of the spectrum is marked as defect .",
    "as explained in previous papers ( e.g. , paper  i ) , thermal instabilities in the spectrograph room induce zero point shifts of the wavelength solution that depend on the position along the ccd ( e.g. , fiber number ) .",
    "this results in instabilities of the radial velocity zero - point .    to correct the final radial velocities for this effect , the processing pipeline uses available sky lines in the rave window and fits a low - order polynomial ( @xmath87 order ) to the relation between sky radial velocity and fiber number .",
    "this @xmath88 order polynomial defines the mean trend of zero point offsets and provides the zero point correction as a function of fiber number order polynomial provides in most cases the best solution ( see paper i ) . ] .",
    "however , in some cases , a low - order polynomial is not the best solution and a constant shift should be used instead . in former releases ,",
    "these cases were corrected by hand in the catalog . in this release",
    ", we introduced a new zero - point correction routine to the processing pipeline that is able to select which correction should be applied , automatically .",
    "the zero - point correction now computes both the cubic correction , using the @xmath87 order polynomial , and the constant correction .",
    "it then computes the mean and standard deviation between the measured sky radial velocities and the corrections for the entire field and for three regions in fiber number that are contiguous on the ccd ( fibers 1@xmath8950 , 51@xmath89100 , 101@xmath89150 ) . for each region ,",
    "the cubic fit is used unless any of these four conditions apply :    * there are less than two sky fibers in that region , to avoid under - constrained fits , * the mean in that region for the constant correction is better than the corresponding mean for the cubic fit , * the standard deviation for the cubic correction is greater than @xmath90 , which is the case for noisy data , * the maximum difference between the constant correction and the cubic correction is larger than @xmath91 .",
    "we tested the new procedure , together with other options , against pairs of repeat observations .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ t : zeropoint ] .",
    "they show clearly that the new procedure performs better than the previous version in terms of dispersion , while the mean difference is unchanged . while the constant term correction appears better in this table , the left panel in fig .",
    "[ f : zeropoint ] shows that the distribution of the residuals is less peaked than for the cubic correction .",
    "in addition , the mean - square - error , defined as @xmath92 $ ] , shows a net decrease with the new fitting procedure compared to a constant shift .",
    "this indicates that for the general case , a constant correction for the entire field will result in a larger dispersion and hence a larger zero - point offset residual .",
    "this gives us confidence in the use of the new procedure .",
    ".radial velocity difference between pairs of repeat observations using different zero - point correction solutions .",
    "the old correction is a combination of cubic fit and corrections applied by hand .",
    "the number of pairs used is 25,172 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from figure  [ f : calib_mh ] , it is clear that applying the dr2 calibration to the dr3 pipeline outputs is not satisfactory and produces a bias at low metallicity .",
    "this behavior is expected as the pipeline has been modified to produce a better agreement to the metallicity distribution which , for dr2 showed a reduced tail at the low metallicity end . as the correlation between the parameters is significant ( see   [ s : correl ] ) and because the calibration relation is built upon the output parameters ( with a large contribution from @xmath28 which is modified compared to the dr2 pipeline ) , one therefore expects the dr2 calibration relation not to hold for the dr3 parameters . ideally , the dr3 parameters would not need a calibration relation .",
    "however the raw output of the dr3 pipeline still suffers from a small systematic effect , underestimating the true metallicity by @xmath930.1  dex with some systematic dependency on @xmath26 .    applying the calibration relations proposed , the rave metallicties agree with the echelle values ( see table  [ t : calib_stat ] ) .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f : calib_mh ] , a systematic trend is observed for dwarfs at high metallicity , where the difference between rave and the echelle value reaches 0.4  dex for the highest metallicity stars . at low metallicity ,",
    "the dispersion is significantly reduced and when applying any of the calibration relations , the two determinations agree well . adding @xmath27 or @xmath94 to the calibration relation",
    "does not improve the residuals significantly .",
    "for @xmath27 this is understood as it is the atmospheric parameter with the largest uncertainty .",
    "hence its dispersion prevents it from having significant weight in the calibration relation , even though we know the error on this parameter is strongly correlated to errors in @xmath29 ( see section  [ s : correl ] ) . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the situation is less clear but part of its low weight in the calibration relation is linked to the fact that , in order to observe rave targets at high resolution , we selected targets in the bright part of the catalog to ensure enough @xmath94 in the spectra to allow precise measurements of the atmospheric parameters . hence , the region of the @xmath94 space where this parameter plays an important role ( @xmath95 ) is not properly sampled , lowering its weight on the calibration relation whereas above this threshold , no correlation with @xmath94 is observed .",
    "finally , to improve on the situation for the dwarfs , we split the sample between dwarfs and giants ( see fig .",
    "[ f : calib_hr ] for the criterion used ) and applied the same procedure to each sub - population .",
    "the result of these calibration relations is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : calib_mh_split ] , the basic statistics being reported in table  [ t : calib_stat ] for each calibration relation .    using separate calibration relations for dwarfs and giants does help improve the dispersion for dwarfs , but , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ f : calib_mh_split ] , the calibration relation is unable to remove the bias at high @xmath29 , the most discrepant stars being rejected by the fit . only a mild improvement is obtained .",
    "separating the dwarfs from the giants changes the calibrated metallicity for these stars by only 0.02  dex , or 0.05  dex if one also uses @xmath27 in the calibration .",
    "the dr3 release of the rave catalog contains @xmath0 radial velocity measurements for @xmath1 individual stars .",
