    "a supersymmetric model with conserved @xmath6-parity provides a candidate for dark matter particle , i.e. the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and can sustain the time from the big bang to the current time . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", all fermion and gauge fields of the standard model are given supersymmetric partners and there are two higgs multiplets .",
    "furthermore , supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken and the breaking is represented by soft breaking terms . assuming the most general mssm , however , one has too many free parameters to deal with .",
    "the number of free parameters is reduced significantly when one assumes some kind of susy breaking mechanism .",
    "one such model is the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , or also known as the minimal supergravity model ( msugra )  @xcite , where some universalities are imposed in the soft breaking terms , such that we have only five free parameters in this model : @xmath5 ( the universal scalar mass at the gut scale ) , @xmath7 ( the universal gaugino mass at the gut scale ) , @xmath8 ( the universal trilinear couplings at the gut scale ) , @xmath9 ( the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values ) , and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the higgs mixing parameter .    the best candidate for dark matter in the cmssm is the lightest neutralino @xmath1 . in our analysis , we take its relic density to be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the hubble constant in the unit of 100  km  mpc@xmath15  s@xmath15 .",
    "the upper limit is imposed by the measurement of the age of the universe , while the lower limit is suggested by astrophysical observations .",
    "one can relax the lower limit if there are other sources of dark matter .",
    "the cosmologically favored regions in the cmssm have been studied intensively for more than a decade .",
    "this includes the bulk  @xcite , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 pole rapid annihilation  @xcite , the neutralino - stau ( @xmath18 ) coannihilation  @xcite and the focus point  @xcite regions .",
    "it has also been realized that stop @xmath0 can be degenerate with @xmath1 when @xmath19 is large  @xcite .",
    "therefore we should also consider the neutralino - stop coannihilation  @xcite to complete our study on the cmssm parameter space  @xcite .",

    "the ( red ) dotted line is the contribution from @xmath30 .",
    "the pale ( blue ) solid line is the @xmath31 annihilation cross section if we neglect the coannihilation effect . ]",
    "neutralino relic density is calculated  @xcite by assuming that in the early universe neutralino was in thermal equilibrium with other particles .",
    "when the expansion rate of the universe was greater than the scattering rate that keeps the neutralino in equilibrium , the neutralino froze out .",
    "the relic density is obtained by evolving the boltzmann equation from the freeze out to the current time .",
    "although , within @xmath6-parity conservation , the neutralino can not decay , it can pair annihilate or coannihilate with other supersymmetric particles into standard model particles .",
    "coannihilation effect is exponentially suppressed by boltzmann factor , so it is only important when the mass difference between the particles involved is small  @xcite .    to understand how the neutralino - stop degeneracy can occur ,",
    "let us look at the mass spectrum .",
    "the lightest neutralino in this model is mostly bino with mass @xmath32 .",
    "the stop square - mass matrix is    @xmath33    although @xmath34 is generally heavier than @xmath35 , the off - diagonal terms can be very large due to the large top mass @xmath36 , and this suppresses one of the eigenvalues , @xmath37 . for a large @xmath38 with @xmath39 , we get a light @xmath0 .    processes involved in the neutralino - stop coannihilation are listed in table 1 .",
    "the most dominant contribution comes from @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are also dominant when the final states are kinematically available .",
    "processes that have only electroweak couplings , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , contribute only @xmath46 and therefore can be neglected .    to see the significant of this coannihilation",
    ", we plot the separate contribution to the annihilation cross section @xmath26 versus @xmath47 . fig .",
    "1 shows such a plot with @xmath23 , @xmath48  gev and @xmath25  gev . for small @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath26 is dominated by stop - stop ( @xmath27 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) annihilation .",
    "notice that , had we neglected the coannihilation effect , we would get a @xmath26 up to four order of magnitude less . passing over the @xmath52 production threshold at @xmath53 ,",
    "the @xmath29 coannihilation becomes dominant .",
    "the coannihilation effect is suppressed when @xmath49 is large and , in this case , can be neglected for @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 the stop mass is much heavier than the neutralino mass .",
    "we start seeing the neutralino - stop coannihilation tail at @xmath56  gev for @xmath23 . here",
    "we show an example of cmssm region with neutralino - stop coannihilation tail .",
    "2 is a contour plot on the @xmath57 plane with @xmath23 , @xmath58  gev and @xmath24 .",
    "the red shaded region is excluded because it has charged lsp , either stau for small @xmath5 or stop for small @xmath7 .",
    "the light ( turquoise ) shaded region is the one that has @xmath59 .",
    "we still see the neutralino - stau coannihilation tail extending to larger @xmath7 .",
    "the bulk region , common in the cmssm , is hidden inside the red shading on the left - bottom corner . extending to higher",

    "plane for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath60  gev .",
    "the very dark ( red ) shaded regions are excluded because the lsp is the @xmath61 or the @xmath62 .",
    "the light ( turquoise ) shaded regions are those favored by cosmology , with after the inclusion of coannihilation effects . ]    around @xmath63  gev there is top production threshold , and there the region favored by cosmology is broader .",
    "this can be understood as the following . beyond the threshold",
    ", neutralino can pair annihilates into @xmath64 through channels shown in fig .",
    "because of the large @xmath36 , a small content in the neutralino is enough to make this channels significant .",
    "furthermore , near the neutralino - stop degeneracy line , @xmath0 is relatively light , and this enhances the cross section to the level needed to bring the relic density into the preferred range .",

    "thus a complete proposal for the future accelerator search for supersymmetry should also consider the neutralino - stop coannihilation region .    higher @xmath5 supresses the neutralino - proton cross section .",
    "thus the neutralino - stop coannihilation predicts the possibility of a lower neutralino direct detection rate .",
    "however this reduction should be less than about one order of magnitude , as the tail extending not to a very high @xmath5 .",
