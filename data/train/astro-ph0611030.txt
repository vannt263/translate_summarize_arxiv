    "based on observation by 4 large imaging air cherenkov telescopes in namibia , the hess group recently reported the discovery of 14 new gamma - ray sources in the tev region , among which 8 sources are unidentified ( unid ) or supernova remnant ( snr)-like @xcite .",
    "many of the 14 sources have a harder energy spectrum ( indices : @xmath21.8 to @xmath22.8 ) at tev energies than the standard candle crab ( index : @xmath22.6 ) .",
    "these energy spectra were measured from 200  gev and turned out to extend up to 10  tev approximately .",
    "cosmic rays are supposed to be accelerated up to the knee energy region at snrs in our galaxy .",
    "therefore , we naturally expect gamma rays in the 100  tev region ( 10 - 1000  tev ) which originate in @xmath3 decays produced by the accelerated charged cosmic rays interacting with matter surrounding the snrs .    here , we will demonstrate our excellent sensitivity of the tibet air shower array plus muon detector array ( tibet as+md array ) to gamma rays in the 100  tev region calculated by the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and give some speculation on 100  tev gamma - ray source candidates .",
    "the tibet air shower experiment has been successfully operated at yangbajing ( 90.522@xmath4  e , 30.102@xmath4  n , 4,300  m above sea level ) in tibet , china since 1990 . at present , the tibet as array consists of 789 plastic scintillation counters of 0.5  m@xmath5 each viewed by the 2 inch - in - diameter photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) , placed on a 7.5  m square grid with an enclosed area of 37,000  m@xmath5 to detect high - energy ( @xmath6 a few tev ) cosmic - ray air showers as shown by open squares and circles in figure  [ fig:1 ] @xcite .",
    "we are planning to build a water - cherenkov - type muon detector array ( tibet md array ) around the tibet as array .",
    "each muon detector is a waterproof concrete pool , 6  m wide @xmath1 6  m long @xmath1 1.5  m deep in size , equipped with a 20 inch - in - diameter ( 20@xmath7 ) pmt ( hamamatsu r3600 ) .",
    "the inside of the concrete pool is painted with white epoxy resin to waterproof and to efficiently gather catoptric water cherenkov lights by a downward facing pmt .",
    "the tibet md array consists of 240 muon detectors set up 2.5  m underground ( 2.0  m soil + 0.5  m concrete ceiling : @xmath819 radiation length ) as shown by gray areas in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "its total effective area amounts to be 8,640  m@xmath0 for muon detection with an energy threshold of 1  gev .",
    "this configuration of the tibet md array is simply one example for easy installation under the existing tibet as array .",
    "advantages of the underground water cherenkov detector are high cost performance and high sensitivity to muons rather than the electromagnetic component caused by the environmental background radioactivity and the air shower cascade , because it is easy to design its pool depth (= path length of a muon ) deeper , compared with a scintillation detector",
    ".    the dark pulse rate of 20@xmath7 pmt measured in laboratory is typically 100  hz above 10 photoelectrons ( pes ) at 10@xmath9 gain at 1500  v supplied voltage . in this case ,",
    "relativistic muons made by primary cosmic rays near the top of atmosphere dominate the accidental background at approximately 10  khz per 36  m@xmath0 muon detector .",
    "our daq system will enable us to set the time window for muons to 200  ns by the offline analysis , therefore , the accidental event rate will be 0.5 ( @xmath10 ) events per air shower trigger .",
    "the water for the tibet md array ( @xmath813  kton ) will be supplied from abundant underground water pumped up at a village adjacent to our site . according to an examination of this water",
    ", the light attenuation length is longer than several tens of meters .",
    "the water in the pools will be continuously circulated through 0.1 @xmath11 m mesh filter and uv sterilizer to keep the light attenuation length .",
    "the water never freezes and bacteria do not proliferate easily , since the temperature at 2.5  m underground remains stable and cold between 3@xmath4c and 12@xmath4c through the year .",
    "the air shower events induced by cosmic rays and gamma rays are generated by the corsika ver.6.204 code @xcite with qgsjet01c for the hadronic interaction model .",
    "primary cosmic rays are thrown along crab s orbit around the earth , and the relative chemical composition model @xcite of primary cosmic rays is adopted based mainly on direct observational data in the energy range from 0.3  tev to 10000  tev .",
    "primary gamma rays are also thrown along crab s orbit around the earth assuming a differential power - law spectrum of @xmath12 in the energy range from 0.3  tev to 10000  tev .",
    "air shower events are uniformly thrown within a circle radius 300  m centered at the array center .",
    "this radius is sufficient to collect all air shower events which are actually triggered in our array .",
    "the simulation of the tibet as array including the scintillation detector response was already established based on the epics uv8.00 code @xcite .",
    "finally , we get the estimated / true air shower direction , core position , the sum of particle density for all detectors ( @xmath13 ) related to true energy , and so on for each air shower event . distributions of the mc events , such as parameters mentioned above , etc , are consistent with experimental data .",
    "the trigger condition is imposed by the tibet as array , i.e. , each shower event should fire four or more of the scintillation detectors recording 1.25 particles or more .",
    "the energies at 100% trigger efficiency are estimated to be approximately 10  tev for gamma rays and 30  tev for cosmic rays , respectively .",
    "after the air shower reconstruction and some event selections , the angular resolution and energy resolution are also estimated to be approximately 0.2@xmath4 and 40% at 100  tev , respectively .",
    "the response of the water cherenkov muon detector and the soil as an absorber are simulated based on geant4  8.0 code @xcite , considering the detailed structure of the tibet md array .",
    "first , we trace the secondary particles of air showers triggered by the tibet as array in the underground soil ( 2.0  g/@xmath14 : 70% sio@xmath15 , 20% al@xmath15o@xmath16 , 10% cao ) .",
    "all surviving particles under the soil with energies exceeding the cherenkov threshold are subsequently fed into the simulation of the tibet md array including 0.5  m thick concrete ( 2.3 g/@xmath14 : 100% sio@xmath15 ) ceilings and walls .",
    "the reflectance at the surface of walls is assumed to be 70% with isotropic reflection .",
    "after we simulate cherenkov radiation , propagation of cherenkov photons in water , and the response of 20@xmath7 pmt , the number of photoelectrons ( @xmath17 ) is counted up for each muon detector .",
    "the quantum efficiency of 20@xmath7 pmt for wavelengths of 340 - 400  nm is approximately 20% .",
    "the peak of @xmath17 is estimated to be 26  pes with width @xmath18 + 130%@xmath230% approximately for one muon detector when a vertical muon passes through a muon detector .",
    "for the tibet md array as a function of @xmath19 for the tibet as array . blue and green points indicate gamma - induced and hadron - induced air showers , respectively . closed circles and error bars show median , 80% and 20% values , respectively .",
    "the cut to suppress hadron - induced air showers is shown as a solid line .",
    "air showers with no recorded pe by the tibet md array are plotted as @xmath20 = 1.2 .",
    "upper right : @xmath21 distribution in typical energy band 10 tev ( 100@xmath22@xmath13@xmath23215 ) .",
    "lower right : 100 tev ( 1000@xmath22@xmath13@xmath232154 ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]        figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of @xmath20 for the tibet md array as a function of @xmath19 for the tibet as array by the mc simulation , where @xmath21 denotes the sum of @xmath17 for muon detectors fired with a threshold @xmath24 and @xmath19 is the sum of particle density for all scintillation detectors , @xmath19 = 1000 corresponds approximately to 100  tev primary cosmic - ray energy .",
    "@xmath21 also takes the accidental muons into account by poisson distribution with an average 0.5 muons / event as described in @xmath25[sec:1 ] . to select muon - poor air showers ,",
    "we optimize the cut condition on @xmath21-@xmath19 plot as shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the survival efficiency after the cuts by the mc simulation .",
    "hadron - induced air showers are suppressed by 99% around @xmath19 = 1000 , while gamma ray - induced air showers remain by more than 95% .",
    "finally , we calculate the integral flux sensitivity of the tibet as+md array to gamma rays as shown by the thick solid curve in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that our sensitivity above 200  tev is defined as a flux corresponding to 15 gamma - ray events , since the background events are fully suppressed to less than one event .",
    "then , how many known / unknown sources do we expect to detect by the tibet as+md array , assuming the energy spectra of the gamma - ray sources extended up to the 100 tev region ?",
    "the diffuse gamma rays from the cygnus region reported by the milagro group @xcite , tev  j2032 + 4130 @xcite , hess  j1837 - 069 @xcite , crab , mrk421 are clearly detectable .",
    "cas  a @xcite , hess  j1834 - 087 @xcite , and m87 @xcite are marginal .",
    "in addition to these existent / established sources , we can expect unknown sources in the northern sky .",
    "most of the hess 14 sources would be detected by the tibet as+md array , as is shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] , if it were located at the hess site .",
    "there exist approximately 80 snrs within the scanned area by the hess telescopes , while the tibet as+md array also observes 80 snrs within its field - of - view .",
    "this in turn means that we can expect to discover a dozen new sources , half of which will be unid or snr - like , in the northern sky where no extensive search has been done by an apparatus with sensitivity comparable to hess .",
    "the magic and veritas experiments in the northern hemisphere , together with the tibet as+md array will contribute to a deeper understanding of the origin and acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays .     for 50 hours ( magic , veritas and hess from the upper curve ) .",
    "the thick solid curve demonstrates the sensitivity of the tibet as+md array at 5 @xmath26 for 3 calendar years .",
    "closed circles show the integral fluxes converted from observed differential fluxes of `` hess j '' sources point by point assuming their spectral indices @xcite .",
    "thin lines show fittings and extrapolations to hess data points .",
