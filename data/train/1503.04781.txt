    "modern semiconductor nanodevices have reached critical device dimensions in the sub-10 nanometer range .",
    "these devices consist of complicated two or three dimensional geometries and are composed of multiple materials .",
    "confined geometries such as ultra thin body ( utb)@xcite , finfets@xcite and nanowires@xcite structures are usually adopted in nanometer scale device designs to obtain desired performance characteristics.most of the electrically conducting devices are not arranged in infinite periodic arrays , but are of finite extent with contacts controlling the current injections and potential modulation . typically , there are about 10000 to 10 million atoms in the active device region with contacts controlling the current injection .",
    "these finite sized structures suggest an atomistic , local and orbital - based electronic structure representation for device level simulation .",
    "quantitative device design requires the reliable prediction of the materials band gaps and band offsets within a few mev and important effective masses within a few percent in the geometrically confined active device regions .",
    "etb model is usually fitted to bulk dispersions without any definition of the spatial wave function details .",
    "however , recent _ ab - initio _ study of utbs  @xcite showed that the surface carrier distribution in confined systems is strongly geometry and material dependent .",
    "this suggests that the charge distribution for realistic predictions of nanodevice performances should be resolved with subatomic resolution .",
    "_ ab - initio _ methods offer atomistic representations with subatomic resolution for a variety of materials .",
    "however , accurate _ ab - initio _ methods , such as hybrid functionals  @xcite , gw  @xcite and bse approximations  @xcite are in general computationally too expensive to be applied to systems containing millions of atoms .",
    "furthermore , those methods assume equilibrium and can not truly model out - of - equilibrium device conditions where e.g. a large voltage might have been applied to drive carriers .",
    "the etb methods are numerically much more efficient than _ ab - initio _ methods .",
    "etb has established itself as the standard state - of - the - art basis for realistic device simulations .",
    "it has been successfully applied to electronic structures of millions of atoms  @xcite as well as on non - equilibrium transport problems that even involve inelastic scattering .",
    "@xcitethe accuracy of the etb methods depend critically on the careful calibration of the empirical parameters . the traditional way to determine the etb parameters is to fit etb band structures to experimental data of bulk materials .",
    "@xcite    the etb basis functions remain implicitly defined during traditional fitting processes .",
    "the lack of explicit basis functions makes it difficult to predict wave function dependent quantities like optical matrix elements with high precision .",
    "more importantly , etb models parameterized by traditional fitting processes suffer from potential ambiguity when applied to ultra small structures such as utbs , nanowires and more complicated geometries .",
    "for instance , the existing etb parameters of gaas  @xcite applied to a as terminated gaas utb with an implicit hydrogen passivation model  @xcite results in unphysical top valence band states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unphysical_tb_states ] : the real space probability amplitudes of _ ab - initio _ topmost valence bands correspond to confined states with the probability amplitude peaking in the center of the utb rather than the surface of the utb as in etb.in fig .",
    "[ fig : unphysical_tb_states ] , the hybrid functional calculations include hydrogen atoms explicitly whereas the etb calculations include only their impact implicitly .",
    "@xcite the mismatch between the envelopes of etb and _ ab - initio _ wavefunctions suggests a calibration of wave functions in the etb parameterization process is necessary .",
    "it is also found that the method of passivation ( i.e. implicit or explicit inclusion of hydrogen atoms ) has an effect on the nature of the valence band states .    .",
    "therefore , a more fundamental fitting process that relates both the band structure and the wave functions of etb models with _ ab - initio _ calculations is desirable .",
    "existing approaches to construct localized basis functions and tightbinding - like hamiltonians from _ ab - initio _ results include maximally localized wannier functions(mlwf ) ,  @xcite quasi - atomic orbitals ,  @xcite or dft - tb analysis .",
    "@xcitethe mlwfs are constructed using bloch states of either isolated bands  @xcite or entangled bands .",
    "@xcitethese methods typically include interatomic interactions beyond first nearest neighbors",
    ". however , these methods do not eliminate the above discussed ambiguity of the commonly used orthogonal sp3d5s * etb models .",
    "furthermore , these approaches usually disregard excited orbitals which are often needed to correctly parameterize semiconductors conduction bands . in previous work ,",
    "it was already suggested how to generate etb parameters that are compatible with typical etb models and still reproduce _ ab - initio _ results .",
    "@xcitethis previous method was already applied to several materials such as gaas , mgo  @xcite and smse  @xcite and yielded a good agreement between bulk etb and _ ab - initio _ band structures .",
    "however , the resulting wave functions did not satisfactorily agree with the _ ab - initio _ wave functions .    in this paper , an improved algorithm of ref .",
    "is presented that `` maps '' _ ab - initio _ results ( i.e. eigenenergies and eigenfunctions ) to tight binding models .",
    "compared with the previous work@xcite , the presented method allows much better agreement of the etb and _ ab - initio _ wave functions . in this present mapping algorithm ,",
    "rigorous , wavefunction - derived etb parameters for the hamiltonian , for highly localized basis functions , and for explicit surface passivation are obtained .",
    "it is important to mention that the etb hamiltonian of this method can be limited to first nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the mapping process is applied to both bulk si and gaas to generate etb parameters and explicit basis functions from corresponding hybrid functional calculations .",
    "it is demonstrated in this work , that the wave - function derived etb hamiltonian does not yield the ambiguity discussed with fig .",
    "[ fig : unphysical_tb_states ] . in the same way , the transferability of the etb model to nanostructures is improved .",
    "this is demonstrated by a comparison of etb and hybrid functional results in gaas and si utbs .",

    "the cations and anions in gaas utbs form different envelopes for all of the presented states .",
    "the lowest conduction and highest valence states turn out to be well confined states in si utbs in all of the calculations . while , in gaas utbs , the lowest conduction states has significant contribution from the surface atoms . in si",

    "it is clear that , for a given set of bulk parameters , the implicit passivation model leads to wavefunctions that are less - confined than those of the explicit passivation model . on the other hand , with the same passivation model , the etb parameters by this works shows more confined top valence states than the existing etb parameters .",
    "thus the un - confined etb state using the existing parameter set and implicit passivation model appears to be due to both the bulk gaas parameters and the passivation model .",

    "remarkably , in both cases the topmost valence - band state became much more confined .",
    "bulk valence band wave functions in modified and original parameter sets tell the story : the general trend is that bulk sets which generate more @xmath60-like top of vb states give better confinement under passivation ( and especially implicit passivation ) than do those with higher d - content .",
    "the reduction of @xmath272 and @xmath273 lead to more @xmath60-like top vb states .",

    "the band gap change in si utbs thicker than 3 nm can be model by effective mass model ( assuming parabolic e - k relation ) .",
