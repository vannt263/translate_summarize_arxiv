    "a rigorous theoretical framework within which quarkonium production can be studied is provided by the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism developed by bodwin , braaten , and lepage  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on nrqcd  @xcite , an effective field theory that can be made equivalent to full qcd to any desired order in heavy - quark relative velocity .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formalism is not a model , but rather a rigorous derivation within nrqcd of a factorized form for quarkonium production and decay rates .",
    "a central result of the nrqcd factorization formalism is that inclusive quarkonium production cross sections must have the form of a sum of products of short - distance coefficients and nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the short - distance coefficients are associated with the production of a heavy quark - antiquark pair in a specific color and angular - momentum state .",
    "they can be calculated using ordinary perturbative techniques . as to the nrqcd matrix elements , they parameterize the effect of long - distance physics such as the hadronization of the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "these can be determined phenomenologically .",
    "the power of the nrqcd formalism stems from the fact that factorization formulas for observables are essentially expansions in the small parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average relative velocity of the heavy quark and anti - quark in the quarkonium bound state .",
    "@xmath5 for charmonium , and 0.1 for bottomonium .",
    "nrqcd @xmath4-scaling rules  @xcite allow us to estimate the relative sizes of various nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "this information , along with the dependence of the short - distance coefficients on coupling constants , permits us to decide which terms must be retained in expressions for observables so as to reach a given level of accuracy . generally , to leading order , factorization formulas involve only a few matrix elements , so several observables can be related by a small number of parameters .",
    "nrqcd predictions therefore presuppose qcd , factorization , and a reasonably convergent @xmath3 expansion .",
    "if the quantitative predictions of nrqcd fail , one of these three assumptions is failing , most likely the validity of the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "in many instances of @xmath0 production , the most important nrqcd matrix elements are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "these four quantities parametrize the hadronization into a @xmath0 boundstate of a @xmath10 pair produced initially with the stated quantum numbers ( angular momentum @xmath11 , color quantum number 1 or 8) . previous to the development of the factorization formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , most @xmath0 production calculations took into account only the hadronization of @xmath10 pairs initially produced in the color - singlet @xmath12 state , as parameterized by @xmath6 .",
    "recently , in regard to the three most important color - octet matrix elements involved in @xmath0 production , it has been noticed that there prevails a certain inconsistency between the values measured at cdf @xcite and those measured in other processes @xcite .",
    "we propose here that inclusive @xmath0 production from @xmath13-decay can be of avail in unravelling this difficulty by serving as a supplementary arena for measuring the contentious matrix elements .",
    "inclusive production of @xmath0 from @xmath13-decay provides two measurable combinations of the matrix elements .",
    "the first one is the helicity - summed rate @xmath14 . the second combination concerns the polarization parameter @xmath2 appearing in the electromagnetic decay rate of @xmath0 to lepton pairs : @xmath15 where the polar angle @xmath16 is defined in the @xmath0 rest frame for which the @xmath17-axis is aligned with the direction of motion of the @xmath0 in the lab .",
    "the short - distance physics for the process @xmath18 is described by the four - quark fermi interactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , at the @xmath21 scale .",
    "the feynman diagram is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "let us define @xmath22 to be the total four - momentum of the @xmath10 system .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks are assumed massless .",
    "we first calculate the factorization formula for the spin - summed @xmath0 production rate .",
    "let us define @xmath25 as the relative momentum of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks evaluated in the rest frame of the @xmath10 pair .",
    "the nrqcd matching formalism requires only that we know the algebraic form of the amplitude for small values of @xmath25 .",
    "this is because the hadronization of the heavy quark pair into quarkonium occurs with nonnegligible probability only when @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , this is the regime in which the nrqcd effective lagrangian is valid .",
    "therefore , we expand the feynman amplitude in powers of @xmath25 and keep only pieces up to linear order .",

    "the factors involving @xmath36 and @xmath37 are wilson coefficients which govern the scale - evolution of the four - quark fermi interaction .",

    "we have taken the inital @xmath13-quark to be unpolarized . here",
    "@xmath43 are nrqcd @xmath0 production matrix elements .",
    "we consider only the leading color - singlet piece and the leading color - octet pieces in the relativistic @xmath3-expansion .",
    "our calculation of the coefficients in the above spin - summed factorization formula concurs with the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to the nrqcd @xmath4-scaling rules , the color - octet matrix elements in eq .",
    "[ totalfacform ] are all expected to be suppressed by @xmath44 with respect to the basic color - singlet matrix element @xmath6 .",
    "thus , at the outset , one would not expect the octet contributions to play a major role in the production of @xmath0 articles .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the color - singlet coefficient @xmath45 decreases significantly as it is evolved down from its value of 1 at the scale @xmath46 to its value of roughly 0.40 at the scale @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "the color - octet coefficient @xmath47 increases slightly from 1 at the scale @xmath46 to roughly 1.10 at the scale @xmath21 . for this reason ,",
    "the octet contributions are actually as important as , or more important than , the basic singlet contribution .",
    "in fact , the short - distance coefficients in the color - octet terms are some 50 times larger than those in the singlet term !",
    "in the previous section , we discussed how the serendipitous wilson - coefficient enhancement of the octet contributions enables us to measure the color - octet matrix elements contributing to the helicity - summed rate @xmath48 .",
    "this enhancement can be further exploited to determine the color - octet matrix elements by considering the polarization of the produced @xmath0 s , as measured by the parameter @xmath2 in eq .",
    "[ thetadefined ] .",
    "it can be calculated via the formula @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the production rate of @xmath0 with helicity @xmath51 .    since @xmath2 is a ratio , we need only calculate the relative sizes of the various contributions to the helicity rates .",
    "thus , we need only calculate the effective feynman amplitude squared , evaluated in the @xmath13 rest frame , with the @xmath0 momentum @xmath52 oriented in the positive @xmath17-direction . in this case , the angular momentum of the @xmath0 in the canonical @xmath17-direction corresponds simply to the particle s helicity .",

[ rlambda ] , we have adopted the standard practice of rewriting the matrix element @xmath54 using the relation @xmath55 this latter relation is due to heavy - quark spin symmetry , and is valid up to relative order @xmath3 .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that @xmath13-decay does not actually produce @xmath10 states in the @xmath56 configuration at leading order in the coupling constants .",

    "thick arrows denote intrinsic angular momenta , with @xmath58 denoting the helicity of the @xmath10 system prior to hadronization .",
    "since the charged - current fermi interaction couples only the left - handed parts of the fermion fields , the masslessness of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks ensures that they are emitted with negative helicity .",
    "therefore , due to angular momentum conservation , the helicity outcome @xmath59 is not allowed .",
    "this has certain obvious consequences for the @xmath0 helicity production rates : the basic color - singlet contribution ( parametrized by @xmath6 and involving the direct hadronization of a color - singlet @xmath12 state into a @xmath0 ) is zero for @xmath60 , at lowest order in the relativistic expansion . the same is also true of the @xmath7 contribution , which involves the hadronization of a color - octet @xmath12 state into a @xmath0 via the heavy - quark - spin - preserving @xmath61 emission or absorption of two soft gluons  @xcite .",

    "[ alphasig ] and [ rlambda ] , we can express @xmath2 in terms of the nrqcd matrix elements . before proceding ,",

    "no similar constraint need to be applied to the matrix element @xmath98 .",

    "the bare matrix element ( which is of course positive definite ) contains a power ultraviolet divergence .",
    "such a power ultraviolet divergence must be proportional to a matrix element of an operator of lower dimension . in the case of @xmath99 ,",
    "the divergence is proportional to @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "this divergence must be subtracted to obtain the renormalized matrix element .",
    "since the piece subtracted is comparable in magnitude to the bare matrix element , the difference can be negative .",
    "on the other hand , since the operator @xmath101 belongs to the set of lowest dimension nrqcd four - fermion operators , the bare matrix element @xmath8 can not have power divergences .",
    "thus the subtractions involved in renormalization can not transform the positive definite bare matrix element into a negative quantity  @xcite . due to these considerations",
