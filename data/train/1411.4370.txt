    "recent experimental observations of the two fragment yields in coincidences by the two fobos - detectors  @xcite placed at 180@xmath12 , using the missing mass approach , have established the phenomenon of _ collinear cluster tripartition _ ( cct ) of the massive nuclei . this new decay mode has been observed for the spontaneous decay of @xmath0cf(sf , fff ) and for neutron induced fission in @xmath3u(n@xmath4,fff ) , see refs .",
