    "minimal surfaces are classical objects of geometry , defined by the condition that their mean curvature is zero everywhere .",
    "equivalently , minimal surfaces represent critical values for surface area , among the space of all surfaces embedded in a given 3-manifold . the word _",
    "minimal _ is a bit of a misnomer , since such critical values are not necessarily local minima .",
    "recently , the author introduced _ topologically minimal _ surfaces @xcite . although their definition is quite different ,",
    "these surfaces possess many of the same properties as the geometrically minimal surfaces described above .",
    "for example , it is well known that a geometrically minimal surface and an incompressible surface can be isotoped so that their intersection curves are essential on both .",
    "this has also been shown to be true of topologically minimal surfaces @xcite .    in recent work , colding and minicozzi @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    "have classified the possible local pictures of a geometrically minimal surface .",
    "for example , given a ball @xmath1 and a geometrically minimal surface @xmath2 , colding and minicozzi showed that if @xmath3 is simply connected , then it is either the graph of a function , or a helicoid . in @xcite ,",
    "the author conjectured that every topologically minimal surface can be isotoped to be geometrically minimal .",
    "an immediate consequence would be that every topologically minimal surface can be isotoped so that its possible local pictures are described by the results of colding and minicozzi .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers where we study the way in which a topologically minimal surface @xmath2 can be isotoped with respect to the tetrahedra of a triangulation .",
    "our goal is to show that @xmath2 can be isotoped so that it meets each tetrahedron in precisely the same way that a geometrically minimal surface can meet a ball , as described by colding and minicozzi .",
    "in such a position , for example , if @xmath4 is a tetrahedron and @xmath5 is simply connected , then we show that @xmath5 is contained in either a plane or a helicoid .",
    "the present work can be viewed from two different perspectives .",
    "as described above , it can be thought of as further strengthening the tie between geometrically and topologically minimal surfaces .",
    "alternately , this work can be seen as a natural extension of results of kneser , haken , rubinstein and stocking on normal and almost normal surfaces .",
    "just as in the case of geometrically minimal surfaces , topologically minimal surfaces have a well defined _ index_. index 0 surfaces are precisely the incompressible surfaces of haken @xcite , and index 1 surfaces are the strongly irreducible surfaces of casson and gordon @xcite .    in 1929 , kneser @xcite showed that an essential sphere @xmath6 can be isotoped to a normal form with respect to an arbitrary triangulation . in this position",
    ", @xmath6 meets each tetrahedron @xmath4 in the same way a plane might .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 is a collection of triangles and quadrilaterals , called _",
    "normal disks_. in later work , haken showed that incompressible ( i.e.  index 0 ) surfaces can be isotoped into the same normal form @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite , rubinstein and stocking independently showed that strongly irreducible ( i.e.  index 1 ) surfaces can be isotoped to meet each tetrahedron of a given triangulation in a collection of normal disks , with at most one possible exception in one tetrahedron .",
    "this exceptional piece is either a saddle - shaped octagon , or two normal disks connected by an unknotted tube ( similar to a _ catenoid _ , a classical geometrically minimal surface ) .    in @xcite , the author introduced",
    "_ critical surfaces _ , which are now recognized as the topologically minimal surfaces with index 2 @xcite .",
    "in unpublished work , both the author @xcite and johnson @xcite claimed that critical surfaces can be isotoped to meet the tetrahedra of a triangulation in a collection of planar pieces , with at most two exceptions .",
    "if there are exactly two exceptional pieces , then each is either a tube or an octagon , as described above .",
    "if there is a single exceptional piece then it may be a tube or an octagon as well , or something a bit more complicated .",
    "the possibilities are a helical shaped 12-gon , three normal disks connected by two unknotted tubes , an octagon tubed to a normal disk , or an octagon tubed to itself .",
    "in this paper we give a local definition of the index of a surface .",
    "this is an index that is computed separately in each tetrahedron .",
    "it follows from this definition that the surfaces in a tetrahedron that have index 0 are the normal disks , and the surfaces with index 1 are tubes and octagons . in @xcite",
    "we show that the surfaces in a tetrahedron with index 2 are the other types of exceptional pieces mentioned above . using this language",
    ", we can concisely summarize all of the results mentioned above as follows :    @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite [ t : classical ] a closed , topologically minimal surface @xmath2 whose index is @xmath8 in a triangulated 3-manifold can be isotoped so that the sum , taken over all tetrahedra @xmath4 , of the indices of @xmath5 is at most @xmath0 .",
    "the main result of this paper is a generalization of theorem [ t : classical ] to arbitrary values of the index @xmath0 , and to surfaces with possibly non - empty boundary .",
    "in particular , we show :    [ t : main_paraphrase ] a properly embedded , topologically minimal surface @xmath2 whose index is @xmath0 in a triangulated 3-manifold can be compressed , @xmath9-compressed and isotoped to a surface @xmath10 so that the sum , taken over all tetrahedra @xmath4 , of the indices of @xmath11 is at most @xmath0 .",
    "the compressions in the above theorem are very restricted , and only happen when the initial index @xmath0 is at least three .",
    "in particular , when @xmath2 is closed and @xmath8 , then we recover theorem [ t : classical ] .    theorem [ t : main_paraphrase ]",
    "is the first step in producing a normal form for any index @xmath0 topologically minimal surface , with respect to an arbitrary triangulation . to complete the picture of such a normal form",
    ", one would have to classify all possible surfaces _ in a single tetrahedron _ whose index is @xmath0 . in the first sequel to this paper @xcite",
    ", we begin such a classification .",
    "we show there that if a topologically minimal surface ( with index at least 1 ) in a tetrahedron is simply connected then it is a helicoid .",
    "furthermore , the number of  turns \" of such a helicoid is directly proportional to its index .",
    "this , combined with theorem [ t : main_paraphrase ] , gives us the desired topological version of the colding - minicozzi result mentioned above : any topologically minimal surface in a triangulated 3-manifold can be transformed so that if the intersection with a given tetrahedron is simply connected , then it is either contained in a plane or a helicoid .    in the second sequel to this paper",
    "@xcite we classify all index 2 , non - simply connected surfaces in a tetrahedron .",
    "this result , combined with theorem [ t : main_paraphrase ] and the results from @xcite , gives a normal form for all index 2 topologically minimal surfaces in a 3-manifold , with respect to an arbitrary triangulation .",
    "having such a normal form has several known and potential applications .",
    "for example , in @xcite we combine this normalization result with corollary 11.2 of @xcite to show that there exists a single 3-manifold with infinitely many heegaard splittings with hempel distance ( see @xcite ) exactly one , a fact that was not previously known . in joint work with ryan derby - talbot and eric sedgwick",
    ", we use the normalization of index 2 surfaces to show that the set of heegaard surfaces of 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary does not change after  generic \" dehn filling @xcite .",
    "a potential application is an algorithm to determine if two arbitrary heegaard surfaces are isotopic , and if they are not , the number of stabilizations required to make them isotopic . a second potential application is an algorithm to determine if a given heegaard surface is strongly irreducible .",
    "the author thanks ryan derby - talbot and eric sedgwick for countless helpful conversations about the present work .",
    "much of the difficulty in working in this area is in finding good notation for the myriad of types of disks and complexes that arise .",
    "most of the notation used here was developed jointly with derby - talbot and sedgwick for the paper @xcite , where we present a new proof of the normalization of index 1 surfaces .",
    "many similar ideas are used in both that proof and the present paper .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath2 will represent a connected , orientable surface that is properly embedded in a compact , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold @xmath12 with incompressible boundary and triangulation @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we will assume @xmath2 separates @xmath12 and is not contained in a ball .",
    "in this section we give basic definitions and facts regarding compressing disks and associated disk complexes .",
