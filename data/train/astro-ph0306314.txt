    "one of the major results from _ chandra _ observations of low and intermediate redshift galaxy clusters is the identification of bubble - like structures in the x - ray images @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was first seen with _",
    "rosat _ in the perseus and cygnus - a clusters  @xcite .",
    "these cavities are apparently associated with energy injection due to nuclear activity from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "it appears that powerful radio jets are particularly effective mechanisms for inputting mechanical energy to the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this activity may influence the structure and energetics of gas in the highest density regions in the clusters .",
    "the redistribution of gas produced by this injection of energy may have particularly profound consequences for the rate of cooling of gas in these regions .",
    "this would have an impact on a variety of fields , including theoretical modeling of galaxy formation  as large - scale cooling of gas is a critical route for building the baryonic mass of galaxies @xcite .",
    "studying the influence of agn on their surroundings is therefore important for determining the capacity of this form of feed - back to delay the on - set of gas accretion and star - formation in massive galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the scaling properties of the icm are also best explained by an absence of large amounts of very low entropy gas in cluster cores @xcite . finding a workable mechanism for accomplishing this is at the forefront of cluster formation studies , e.g.  @xcite , and likely candidates are heating and cooling of the icm .",
    "investigating the possibility that radio sources influence the thermodynamics of dense gas in their environments is further motivated by observations which demonstrate that individual , luminous , radio galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath5 ) reside in apparently overdense regions : as traced through excesses of lyman - break galaxies , lyman-@xmath4 emitters , extremely red objects , x - ray detected agn or luminous submillimeter galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus the feedback from agn ( and star formation ) in bright radio sources may have had ample opportunity to influence the formation and evolution of galaxies in regions which are believed to evolve into the cores of clusters at the present - day .",
    "studying luminous radio galaxies in high - density environments at high redshifts therefore provides an important route to track the changing effects of feedback during the formation of a massive cluster of galaxies .",
    "early studies of the x - ray environments of powerful radio galaxies were limited by the modest spatial resolution of the x - ray observations @xcite . however , with arcsecond resolution , high sensitivity and good spectral resolution from _ chandra _ there have been two published searches for hot gas in the vicinity of radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one study detects extended emission at @xmath7 with a mildly favored non - thermal origin and a remarkable morphology ( 3c294 , @xcite ) and the other , with a detection of extended emission at @xmath8 , has been argued to be thermal in origin , although the data is somewhat lower signal - to - noise ( pks 1138 - 262 , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a deep _ chandra _ observation of one of the most distant and powerful high - redshift radio galaxies ; 4c41.17 at @xmath0 .",
    "recent submillimeter observations of this galaxy using the scuba camera have detected intense , and apparently spatially - resolved , submm emission from the radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "this emission is thermal radiation coming from dust grains within the galaxy which are heated by uv photons from young stars or an agn ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity of the galaxy is in excess of 10@xmath9l@xmath10 and the inferred mass of dust is around @xmath11m@xmath10 @xcite , both of which suggest intense star formation is occuring within 4c41.17 .",
    "further evidence for extreme activity occuring in the vicinity of the radio galaxy includes the presence of an extended lyman-@xmath4 halo reaching to @xmath12100kpc ( @xcite ; figure 5 ) as well as spatially - extended [ oii ] and [ oiii ] emission on similar scales @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also shown from spectropolametric observations that the dominant contribution to the restframe uv emission in 4c41.17 must be due to young stars , with a formation rate of 140@xmath13h@xmath14 m@xmath15 , possibly triggered by the expansion of the radio source ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "strong evidence exists for the immediate environment of 4c41.17 being overdense and consistent with a `` proto - cluster '' region .",
    "in particular , in parallel to detecting the resolved submm emission from the radio galaxy , @xcite also tentatively identified an overdensity of bright scuba galaxies in a 1-mpc region around the radio source .",
    "they interpreted this as evidence for vigorous dust - obscured star formation and agn activity during the formation of other massive galaxies clustered around the radio galaxy .",
    "in addition to this highly obscured , massive galaxy population , @xcite have suggested that there is a modest excess of lyman - break galaxies in this region , having found six candidate @xmath16 galaxies in a 1.5-arcmin@xmath17 field , roughly centered on 4c41.17 .",
    "they show that this density is slightly higher than that expected in blank fields , although this comparison is uncertain , and issues of cosmic variance also make it difficult to assess this over - density @xcite .",
    "we also note that spectroscopy of candidate lyman-@xmath4 emission line objects in this field has so far confirmed three sources at the redshift of the radio galaxy in a 3.5-arcmin@xmath17 field , showing an apparent over - density of lyman-@xmath4 emitters in this field  @xcite .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath18 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , consistent with the wmap parameters @xcite . in this cosmology at @xmath0 ,",
    "1@xmath3 corresponds to 7.1kpc , the universe is 1.6gyrs old and the lookback time is 88% of the age of the universe .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of 4c41.17 was made during sept 2526 2002 .",
    "150ks of exposure was obtained using the back - illuminated s3 chip in vfaint mode with two consecutive exposures of @xmath21 ksec .",
    "after good - time filtering , 135 ksec of usable exposure remained .",
    "the data were re - processed using the standard ciao tools to exploit the additional background discrimination of the vfaint mode telemetry . a processed image of 4c41.17 is presented in figure 1 .",
    "appropriate rmf s and arf s were generated for the primary 4c41.17 source location on the s3 chip .",
    "since the s3 chip is currently cti - uncalibrated no cti correction was made to the data .",
    "this observation detects two components of emission associated with 4c41.17 .",
    "the first of these is a bright point - source at 06 50 52.07 + 41 30 31.17 ( j2000 ) and has been corrected to the radio coordinate frame using the position of a hard x - ray source 40@xmath3 south of 4c41.17 which is well detected at 1.4ghz , the offset between the nominal x - ray and radio coordinates for this source was : @xmath22s , @xmath23 . ] .",
    "this x - ray source lies within 0.5@xmath3 of the position of the radio core ( which itself lies @xmath24 east of b1 in figure 2 , @xcite ) and hence is positionally coincident with this component to the limit of our astrometric precision .",
    "the second x - ray component is a region of diffuse emission surrounding this point source ( figures 1 , 2 & 3 ) .",
    "this emission drops away as @xmath25 to the north - east , but is significantly more extended along the direction of the radio jet to the south - west . to measure fluxes for the point - source and extended components",
    "we define an aperture for the point source as a 1@xmath3 square region which fully encompasses the 90% flux - enclosed psf at the on - axis s3 position .",
    "in contrast , fluxes for the diffuse component were measured using an elliptical aperture orientated along the major axis of the 4c41.17 emission ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "background regions were accumulated from ( a ) 10 blank sky regions in this s3 data , selected to be close to the aimpoint and therefore less subject to chip - wide variations , and totaling approximately 4 arcmin@xmath26 ( b ) blank sky regions from the available blank - sky files .",
    "the effect of utilizing ( a ) versus ( b ) in the following analyses was negligible given our other uncertainties .",
    "total count rates were measured for both components in the 0.310 kev bandpass ( restframe 1.4448kev ) . for the diffuse component of 4c41.17",
    "a total count of 200 photons was obtained .",
    "the estimated background from the unresolved x - ray background ( xrb ) was @xmath27 counts , with an effective exposure time of 135.113ks , yielding a background subtracted count rate of @xmath28cts@xmath2 ( see below for estimated luminosities ) .",
    "for the point source , 51 photons were measured in the @xmath29 aperture . by interpolating the surrounding diffuse component",
    "we have estimated a maximum contribution to the point emission of @xmath30 photons , the contribution of the unresolved xrb is negligible for this small region .",
    "the background subtracted point source emission therefore has a count rate @xmath31cts@xmath2 .",
    "owing to its smaller photon count we restrict our spectral analysis of the point source to simply evaluating its hardness ratio ( defined as @xmath32 with the energy ranges of the soft band ( @xmath33 ) of 0.52kev and for the hard band ( @xmath34 ) 210kev , both in the observed frame ) .",
    "we estimate a hardness ratio of @xmath35 and based on previous surveys we conclude that this is consistent with the expected characteristics of a high-@xmath36 type ii agn @xcite , although type i ( with hardness ratios @xmath37 ) can not be ruled out . in estimating the intrinsic luminosity we have therefore adopted the mean photon index @xmath38 , ( @xmath39 ) , and large intrinsic absorption , n(h i)@xmath40 @xmath41 determined by @xcite for @xmath6 type - ii sources with similar hardness ratios .",
    "changing these properties by 1020% ( and ignoring absorption ) has negligible impact on our results .",
    "we determine a flux for the point source ( unabsorbed by galactic n(hi ) ) of @xmath42ergs@xmath2@xmath41 ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) and a luminosity of @xmath43ergs@xmath2 ( 0.3 - 10 kev rest frame ) , or @xmath44ergs@xmath2 ( 1.44 - 48 kev rest frame , corresponding to the 0.3 - 10 kev observed band and therefore the least extrapolation ) .",
    "there are sufficient photons detected in the extended component for us to attempt a slightly more sophisticated analysis .",
    "we begin by constructing a 20 ct per bin , 10 bin spectrum on which conventional spectral analysis can be performed .",
    "we find that this spectrum is inconsistent with thermal bremmstrahlung but an excellent fit is obtained with a single index power law ( using xspec & background subtraction ) .",
    "the best fit photon index ( @xmath45 kev ) was @xmath46 ( 90% confidence limits ) with n(hi ) fixed at the galactic value of @xmath47 @xmath41 ( see figure 4 ) , and reduced @xmath48 . for comparison ,",
    "the measured hardness ratio is @xmath49 , also consistent with a hard spectrum .",
    "no satisfactory fit could be obtained with a thermal mekal model , @xmath50 was constrained as @xmath51 kev in the restframe at @xmath0 .",
    "this is not surprising since even a 10 kev raymond - smith spectrum exhibits relatively little photon count above 4 kev , corresponding to an observed energy ( given @xmath0 ) of 0.83 kev , while we clearly detect the bulk of flux at higher energies ( figure 4 ) .",
    "fitting an intrinsically absorbed power law ( at @xmath0 ) gave a best fit of @xmath52 and n(hi)@xmath53 @xmath41 .",
    "we do not consider this model further as it is difficult to credit such strong absorption being distributed over such a large volume .",
    "a comparison of the extended x - ray emission to the north - east and south - west of the point source shows no significant difference in the spectral properties of these two regions ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we also test the spectrum using the preliminary acisabs model designed to model the modified acis soft response due to molecular contamination and fitting for energies @xmath54 kev  @xcite . with n(hi ) fixed at the galactic value",
    "we obtain a best fit power law of @xmath55 ( 90% ) and reduced @xmath56 . a thermal spectrum fit with the acisabs response yields a best fit of @xmath57 kev ( reduced @xmath58 ) .    using our total count rate for the diffuse emission",
    "associated with 4c41.17 and assuming the measured photon index of @xmath55 obtained with the acisabs response and the galactic n(hi ) column density we estimate an unabsorbed flux of @xmath59ergs@xmath41 ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the errors correspond to the uncertainty in the photon index and the poisson uncertainty in photon counts respectively and are presented in this form to allow for the systematic nature of the error propagated from the power law index .",
    "for our adopted cosmology we therefore estimate an x - ray luminosity of @xmath60ergs@xmath2 ( 1.44 - 48 kev rest frame , corresponding to the 0.3 - 10 kev observed frame ) or @xmath61ergs@xmath2 ( 0.3 - 10 kev rest frame ) .",
    "we have performed several tests to evaluate the limits on a possible thermal component in the diffuse emission around 4c41.17 . as described above , an unsatisfactory fit to a thermal spectrum ( mekal model )",
    "was obtained for the full spectrum .",
    "subdividing the spectrum between 0.32kev ( 1.449.6kev rest frame ) and 210kev ( 9.6 - 48 kev rest frame ) , each with 5 spectral bins , also yielded best power - law fits , consistent to within 90% errors with each other and with the @xmath62 or @xmath63 ( acisabs applied ) overall fit and normalization . fitting a joint thermal and power law spectrum to the full dataset again resulted in an essentially unconstrained thermal component .",
    "finally , we fit a power law to the @xmath64kev data , fixed @xmath65 to the best slope ( @xmath66 ) and then fit for the spectral normalization at @xmath67kev .",
    "again , the best - fit normalization was entirely consistent between these two bands",
    ". very conservatively , the upper limit to any thermal emission must therefore be equal to , or less than , the poisson fluctuation in photon counts in the band 0.30.83",
    "( i.e.  rest frame 1.44kev , assuming negligible thermal emission from @xmath68kev ) .",
    "this yields a count rate limit of @xmath69cts@xmath2(0.30.83kev ) or an unabsorbed bolometric flux ( assuming a generic 4kev plasma ) of @xmath70ergs@xmath2@xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to a bolometric luminosity limit for a thermal spectrum of @xmath71ergs@xmath2 ( i.e.  @xmath72% of the 1.44 - 48 kev rest frame luminosity ) .",
    "thus , while we can only rule out the presence of an x - ray emiting cluster with a luminosity some 40% of that of the virgo cluster , it is clear that the dominant source of the extended x - ray emission is non - thermal .    in summary :",
    "the unresolved x - ray source within 4c41.17 has a luminosity and spectral properties consistent with a heavily obscured , luminous agn ( type - ii ) . while the diffuse x - ray component around 4c41.17 is most likely non - thermal in origin , with a power - law spectrum and significant luminosity .",
    "we limit the contribution from any thermal component to less than @xmath73ergs@xmath2 .",
    "in addition to 4c41.17 , extended x - ray emission has been detected around a number of moderate and high - redshift radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars and these exhibit a variety of strength of correlation between the morphologies in the x - ray and radio bands @xcite .",
    "however , the precise origin of the x - ray emission is still a matter of debate @xcite",
    ". where there is a strong spatial correlation between the emission in the radio and x - ray bands the prefered mechanism could either be synchrotron emission or inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering by the relativistic electrons in the jet plasma of photons from the source itself or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "where there is less apparent spatial correlation between the two wavebands ( possibly due to weaker detections ) , there is more ambiguity . in some cases",
    "it has been suggested that the x - ray emission may be thermal in origin and arise from hot gas in a group or cluster - like structure  @xcite . in the case of 3c 294  @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray emission is very clearly much more extended than the radio structure and exhibits remarkably sharp edge features .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is consistent with ic emission from an older population of relativistic electrons generated by previous episodes of nuclear activity and with confinement by a hot , unseen , icm .",
    "further , tentative support for an ic mechanism operating in some high - redshift radio galaxies studied in the x - ray and radio bands comes from the apparent evolution of the @xmath74 ratios .",
    "ic scattering from the cmb implies that the ratio of x - ray to radio luminosities should scale as @xmath75 ( see equation 1 below ) . using published x - ray luminosities ( see references above ) and radio powers  @xcite we find @xmath76 ( 4c41.17 , @xmath77 ) , 0.21 ( pks1138@xmath78262 , @xmath79 ) , 0.11 ( 3c9 , @xmath80 ) , and 0.08 ( 3c219 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "these ratios are clearly subject to large uncertainties , such as the modeling of the x - ray emission , magnetic fields , and the presence of local far - infrared ( fir ) photon sources .",
    "however , a general trend for increasing @xmath74 with redshift appears to be present , although a poor fit to the expected @xmath75 scaling .    in the case of 4c41.17 , several pieces of evidence also point to a non - thermal ic origin of the diffuse emission .",
    "first , the restframe surface brightness of the emission is @xmath82ergs@xmath2@xmath41arcmin@xmath83 .",
    "this is a factor @xmath84 higher than icm thermal emission in the brightest local galaxy clusters .",
    "ic scattering of cmb photons on the other hand has almost no redshift dependence owing to the cancellation of surface brightness dimming by the corresponding increase in energy density of the cmb with redshift ( although variations in magnetic field strength come into play ) .",
    "second , the measured spectrum of the x - ray emission is a power law , with an energy spectral index @xmath85 . as discussed by  @xcite the integrated radio spectrum of 4c41.17 has a low frequency index of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 mhz rest frame ) , where synchrotron losses have a longer timescale , and an index of @xmath88 for higher frequencies ( 200mhz-48ghz rest frame ) .",
    "if the x - ray emission is ic scattering then a large fraction of the flux must arise from electrons with synchrotron frequencies @xmath89mhz ( see equation 2 below ) and should exhibit the same spectral slope  @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties in both the x - ray and radio spectral fits it appears that the energy spectral indices are indeed consistent  as would be expected if the x - ray and radio photons originated from the same particle population .",
    "thirdly , the overall morphology of the x - ray emission is indeed correlated with the radio maps ( figure 2 ) , especially if one notes that the observed radio emission is at @xmath90 ghz rest frame .",
    "since the radio spectrum is steep in this range ( @xmath91 ) only the highest surface brightness features are seen in the maps . moreover , since the radio source spectra steepen away from the hotspot towards the agn , the radio morphology at low frequencies is somewhat different from that at higher frequencies , with relatively bright ` bridges ' and fainter hotspots ( e.g. cygnus - a ) .",
    "a large abundance of low energy electrons in the bridges would result in increased ic losses and thus brighter x - ray emission from these structures as compared to the hotspots ( modulo the photon field distribution , see below ) .",
    "the primary electron population for ic scattering of the cmb photons must have @xmath92 , or if we are seeing ic scattering of local fir photons then the electrons will have @xmath93 .",
    "by contrast , the electrons responsible for the bulk of the observed radio synchrotron emission ( 5 - 25 ghz rest frame ) have @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the general , but not point - by - point , correlation of radio and x - ray emission ( figures 2 & 5 ) is therefore not unexpected and offers clues to the electron distribution and agn activity .",
    "we discuss this in more detail below .",
    "finally , although our x - ray data are currently too noisy for a definitive measurement , the surface brightness distribution appears to be relatively flat but with quite well delineated edges ( e.g. figure 1 ) .",
    "as discussed by  @xcite for the case of 3c294 , this suggests confinement of an electron population by an external , hot , medium  such as that already posited for 4c41.17 (  @xcite and see  4 ) .",
    "while other , non - ic , non - thermal sources of x - ray emission can not be entirely ruled out , all such sources will be dimmed by @xmath75 , a factor of 530 at @xmath0 , putting serious constraints on possible emission mechanisms .",
    "we suggest therefore that the most likely source for the diffuse x - ray emission around 4c41.17 is ic scattering of cmb / fir photons .",
    "we now discuss this mechanism in more detail , as well as the probable origin of the photons : either the cmb alone or with a contribution from the known luminous fir source .",
    "the relative luminosity of the radio synchrotron and ic x - ray emission from scattering off a photon field is given by :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the magnetic field strength in the plasma and @xmath97 is the energy density of the scattering photons . for the cmb , at a redshift @xmath36 , @xmath98erg@xmath99 @xcite . at @xmath0 with @xmath100k @xcite @xmath101erg@xmath99 .",
    "the relationship between ic scattered energies , @xmath102 , and the synchrotron frequencies emitted by electrons of a given energy is :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the characteristic photon temperature and @xmath105 is the synchrotron radio frequency  @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity of 4c41.17 integrated over all components is @xmath106ergs@xmath2 ( from @xcite and converted to our adopted cosmology ) . in the following calculations we adopt a constant spectral index from 10 - 10,000 mhz of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this is conservative in the sense that it will slightly over - predict the low frequency luminosity and therefore slightly over - predict the expected ic x - ray emission . in figure 5",
    "we plot the ic x - ray luminosity predicted from the known radio spectrum of 4c41.17 and equations 1 and 2 ( in a 1.44 - 48 kev rest frame energy band corresponding to the observed 0.3 - 10 counts and therefore requiring minimal extrapolation ) . the predicted @xmath109 is shown for both cmb photons alone and for 3 cases in which the local mean fir energy density over the emitting volume is 1 , 2 , and 3 times the cmb energy density .",
    "@xcite determine an equipartition field of @xmath1105080@xmath111 g ( their appendix a , adjusted to our assumed cosmology ) in the low surface brightness regions away from the radio hotspots .",
    "figure 5 demonstrates that a significant contribution from the local fir photons is necessary to produce the observed @xmath109 if the equipartition @xmath96 field is correct .",
    "as discussed in  1 , 4c41.17 is one of the most luminous sub - mm sources known .",
    "the galaxy is detected at both 450@xmath111 m and 850@xmath111 m with fluxes of 35.3mjy and 11.0mjy respectively @xcite , implying a graybody temperature of @xmath112 k and @xmath113l@xmath15 ( @xmath114ergs@xmath2 ) for our assumed cosmology .",
    "we note that this exceeds the integrated radio - synchrotron luminosity by a factor @xmath115 , showing that the sub - mm emission arises in a separate component of dust - reprocessed radiation from vigorous star formation or an agn @xcite .",
    "if the local fir emission is point - like and isotropic then the energy density at a distance @xmath116 from the source is @xmath117 . for",
    "the observed @xmath118 then the local photon energy density would exceed that of the cmb , @xmath119 , out to a distance of 13kpc from the source .",
    "clearly then the local fir photons can play a significant role in the observed ic emission and may provide the necessary boost in @xmath109 required by figure 5 .",
    "there is also evidence that the fir source in 4c41.17 is spatially extended .",
    "@xcite claim that the thermal dust emission from 4c41.17 is partially resolved on a scale of 50kpc ( 7@xmath3 , fwhm ) , after correcting for the scuba beam ( figure 2 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this implies a physical extent of the submm emitting region of @xmath120kpc .",
    "we adopt a very crude model for the dust cloud of a sphere of uniform emissivity and diameter @xmath121 , this yields a mean fir energy density of @xmath122 within its volume . in this case the mean local fir energy density in the cloud exceeds that of the cmb if @xmath121 is _ smaller _ than @xmath123kpc ( errors from uncertainties in @xmath118 ) .",
    "a slightly more realistic model has the relativistic plasma modeled as a cylindrical volume of length @xmath124kpc , embedded in the cloud , this would then require that @xmath121 must be _ smaller _ than @xmath125kpc for the volume averaged energy density to be equal to or greater than that of the cmb over the entire emitting region , @xmath126 .",
    "since this is comparable to the claimed size of the dust emission in this system from @xcite it indicates that local fir emission could plausibly make up the apparent shortfall in photons seen in figure 5 , although these estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and are designed to be illustrative rather than definitive .",
    "we note that the relatively flat x - ray emission profile in 4c41.17 also suggests that the dominant source of local fir photons arises in an extended component .",
    "however , the tentative evidence on the north - eastern side for a @xmath127 drop - off (  2 ) suggests that the local fir emission in that direction could have a more compact configuration .",
    "we conclude that it appears necessary and likely inevitable that local fir photons play a role in the ic x - ray emission ( figure 5 )",
    ". however , the inherent difficulties in constraining magnetic field strengths and the unknown true distribution of the electron population make more detailed estimates very difficult .",
    "early indications of the presence of a high - density gas environment around 4c41.17 came from the detection of a strong and spatially variable rotation measure in polarimetry mapping of the various radio structures in the source @xcite .",
    "these rotation measures indicate the presence of large column densities of magnetized , hot gas .",
    "@xcite estimate a total gas mass of @xmath128m@xmath10 ( in our cosmology ) and suggest that this material arises from an x - ray type `` cooling flow '' in a dense cluster environment around 4c41.17 . the results presented here do not rule out this scenario .",
    "our limit of @xmath73 erg s@xmath2 on thermal emission is still compatible with a much more spatially extended thermal component which may be accreting into the central potential and which would be surface brightness dimmed by @xmath129 .    in an effort to further understand the distribution of matter in 4c41.17 we make use here of a very deep lyman-@xmath4 image produced with",
    "a custom - built , high throughput interference filter with a 65    bandpass centered at the redshifted lyman-@xmath4 line at 5839    ( for @xmath130 ) with the echellette spectrograph and imager  @xcite at the cassegrain focus of the keck ii 10 m telescope ( these data have been previously discussed in  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the data were obtained during photometric conditions and good seeing ( fwhm = 0.57@xmath3 ) . with a total exposure time of 27.6ks",
    "this lyman-@xmath4 image is the most sensitive obtained to date and reaches a surface brightness of @xmath131erg@xmath132@xmath41arcsec@xmath83 ( 3@xmath133 limit in a 2.0@xmath3 diameter aperture ) .",
    "a broad - band @xmath116 image , obtained as part of a multi - band spectral energy distribution study of the 4c41.17 field @xcite was scaled and subtracted from the lyman-@xmath4 image to construct the pure emission - line image shown in figure 6 .",
    "in addition , extended [ oii]@xmath1343727 and [ oiii]@xmath1345007 emission has been detected , confirming that the lyman-@xmath4 arises from an ionized medium and not from scattering off a neutral gas . with a linear dimension of @xmath135kpc at the detection limit ,",
    "the 4c41.17 nebula is the largest presently known @xcite .",
    "the lyman-@xmath4 halo shows distinct correlation features with the x - ray and radio maps , including several spur - like lyman-@xmath4 features , which also appear on slightly larger scales in the x - ray emission .",
    "the ic x - ray model as described in  3 might suggest that the x - ray emission would tend to be anti - correlated with lyman-@xmath4 emitting regions owing to the propensity of radio jets to evacuate gas from their volume . indeed this would appear to match reasonably well the situation seen around the south - western jet , a , in figure 6 .",
    "the lyman-@xmath4 spurs to the north and east are are then anomalous , unless we consider an additional mechanism for producing a population of relativistic electrons correlated with the ionized lyman-@xmath4 gas .",
    "the halo of a massive proto - galaxy is likely to consist of a multiphase medium of cool , @xmath136k , clouds or filaments embedded in a virialized medium at @xmath137@xmath138k ( rees 1989 ) .",
    "in such a multi - phase medium the passage of a bow shock driven by an expanding radio source , or by starburst activity , may stimulate a range of behaviour .",
    "the densest patches are likely to be relatively unaffected by the passage of the shock , although they may collapse due to the increased pressure of the gas surrounding them .",
    "in contrast , the intermediate - density clouds will be shocked and ionized , cooling back via lyman-@xmath4 emission .",
    "these shocks may also re - accelerate any older , cooler relativistic electrons caught in the magnetic fields around the radio galaxy . in this picture , there is a direct physical correspondance between regions of lyman-@xmath4 emission , relativistic electrons and x - ray emission as the electrons cool via ic scattering off cmb and local fir photons .",
    "the need for a more localized electron `` re - heating '' is also suggested by comparing the @xmath124myr crossing time of the 4c41.17 system to the ic cooling time of the electrons ( assuming cmb photons only ) : @xmath139$]yr @xcite , which is @xmath140myr for @xmath141 at @xmath0 .",
    "further support comes from the detection of high - velocity outflowing gas around 4c41.17 .",
    "both the [ oii ] and lyman-@xmath4 emission lines exhibit large blue - shifted velocities ( @xmath142900 km s@xmath2 ) along the direction of the principle radio axis and south - western lyman-@xmath4 filament , together with lyman-@xmath4 velocity widths in this filament as high as @xmath1431600 km s @xmath2  @xcite . along this axis",
    "it seems likely therefore that shock heating of the gas will play a major role in powering the lyman@xmath144 emission , and potentially contributing to the accelerated electron population responsible for the ic x - ray emission .",
    "away from this axis however the situation is less clear , since there is still widely distributed ic x - ray emission with correlated and quite uniform , lyman-@xmath4 emission .",
    "finally , and most excitingly , it may be possible for the x - ray emission to produce lyman-@xmath4 emission through local photo - ionization of gas .",
    "the ionization parameter can be estimated to order of magnitude as : @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the mean gas density ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath147 is the physical scale of the gas distribution . taking @xmath148 kpc then @xmath149 .",
    "we know that [ o ii ] and [ o iii ] species exist in the halo gas @xcite , consequently @xmath150 must be in the range 110 @xcite , and probably towards the lower end in order for the recombination lyman-@xmath4 emission to be seen . very crudely then ,",
    "if the typical halo gas density is _ less _ than @xmath151 @xmath99 ( as suggested from the rotation measure , @xcite ) the observed x - ray emission would photoionize the gas to much higher species than observed .",
    "however , in the denser regions it would appear that direct photoionization by the ic x - ray emission is another viable , if not inescapable , mechanism for creating the ionized lyman-@xmath4 halo",
    ". this mechanism could operate either in addition to , or independently of the shock driven ionization , depending on the location relative to the principle jet / out - flow axis as discussed above . at the present moment it is impossible to differentiate between these scenarios , but future optical and near - ir ifu observations of the spatial distribution of a range of emission lines in the halo of 4c41.17 will be a powerful technique to investigate the internal physics of this galaxy .    if it can be demonstrated that it operates , this new ic x - ray photoionization mechanism presents the agn within 4c41.17 with another route to exert feedback on the surrounding gas halo on a larger scale than could be directly surmised from the properties of the radio jets .",
    "moreover , this feedback mechanism may continue to operate after the radio activity has ceased to be directly detectable .",
    "combined with the mechanical energy input of the relativistic electrons , which is likely responsible for the x - ray cavities seen in low - z clusters  @xcite , these represent two major pathways for supermassive black holes to exert significant feedback on scales extending beyond their host galaxies .",
    "perhaps the most important feature of this mechanism is that it is expected to be most effective in the most massive halos at the highest redshifts : those which have been able to build a supermassive black hole large enough to power powerful radio jets .",
    "the mass - specific nature and redshift dependency of this feedback mechanism may provide a new avenue for theoretical attempts to model the formation and growth of the most massive galaxies and clusters seen in the local universe @xcite .",
    "we have detected extended x - ray emission around the luminous radio galaxy 4c41.17 at @xmath0 .",
    "the spectral properties of the diffuse x - ray emission are best described by a power - law model , with a spectral index which is consistent with that seen in the radio waveband . moreover",
    ", the morphology of the x - ray emission correlates well with the general distribution of radio emission .",
    "we propose that inverse compton scattering is the mostly likely origin of the x - ray emission and we limit any contribution from thermal emission by hot gas to less than @xmath152ergs@xmath2 .",
    "we quantify our discussion of ic scattering around 4c41.17 and conclude that if the equipartition estimates of magnetic field strength are valid then the observed x - ray emission is due to the scattering of both cmb and local fir photons .",
    "the detection of the galaxy as a very bright submm source supports this hypothesis .",
    "we compare two simple geometrical models for the thermal dust emission around 4c41.17 .",
    "the x - ray requirements for the mean fir energy density in the plasma volume are that @xmath153 .",
    "the constraints that this imposes on the volume of the fir emitting region are consistent with the crude , direct measurements of the size of the galaxy in the submm waveband , which imply that the dust emission is extended over @xmath120kpc scales ( although subject to considerable uncertainty ) .",
    "we demonstrate that ic x - ray emission , enabled by the enhanced cmb at high redshift and the local fir luminosity of this highly - obscured , active system , can readily ionize the gas in the halo of this galaxy .",
    "while it is unlikely that this is the sole mechanism by which the lyman-@xmath4 halo is produced , it seems inevitable that it plays a significant role , especially away from the large out - flow velocities seen along the principle radio axis .",
    "it could also be very efficient at ionizing the less dense , outer halo .",
    "importantly , if the observed lyman-@xmath4 emission is recombination following photo - ionization then this gas could also have a significantly lower temperature , and shorter cooling time .",
    "ic x - ray emission from high-@xmath36 supernovae has been suggested as a reionization mechanism in the early universe  @xcite , with profound implications for the formation of stars and galaxies . on the basis of our results presented here",
    "we are compelled to add that ic x - ray emission from early agn activity should also be an important feedback mechanism  especially given that the diffuse ic emission from the cmb can easily exceed that directly due to accretion onto the central black hole , and that its diffuse nature permeates the halo volume more thoroughly . moreover",
    ", this form of feedback will operate preferentially in the most massive halos , those which are able to host powerful radio galaxies .",
    "this mechanism , together with the mechanical energy injected by the agn via relativistic electrons may therefore address the fundamental problem of overcooling in models of the formation of massive galaxies and clusters in the local universe @xcite .",
    "as we have shown , 4c41.17 exhibits three of the main features currently expected to regulate star formation in massive galaxies @xcite : an ordered magnetic field ( detected as a strong rotation measure ) to allow conduction of heat from the outskirts of the halo into the centre and so suppress the cooling of gas ; agn - driven feedback in the form of the mechanical input from the radio jets and lobes ; and outflows associated with visible and obscured massive star formation .",
    "however , it is intriguing that even this combination of three mechanisms apparently hasnt _ yet _ been able to suppress the star formation in this massive galaxy ( dey et al .",
    "1997 ; ivison et al.2001 ) .",
    "finally , we suggest that the combination of intense , but obscured , activity in 4c41.17 , coupled with its high redshift , and hence the strong increase in the energy density of the cmb , has aided in our identification of the x - ray halo around this galaxy . if correct this would imply that large halos , containing large populations of low energy electrons ( tracers of past radio activity ) , ordered magnetic fields and significant quantities of ionized gas , may be common around all massive galaxies at high redshifts , @xmath154 . if the ic x - ray emission plays an important photo - ionization role this would also provide an additional mechanism for switching on lyman-@xmath4 halos at high-@xmath36 by radio activity and the cmb / fir photons alone . clearly the rapid decline in the energy density in the cmb , coupled with a similar strong decline in the typical fir luminosities of active galaxies at @xmath155 @xcite",
    "mean that ic scattered x - ray halos should rapidly decrease in intensity at lower redshifts .",
    "together with existing data from other wavebands these _ chandra _ results point towards an extraordinary environment in systems like 4c41.17 .",
    "the central agn is periodically injecting high energy electrons and energy through the length of the medium in which it is embedded .",
    "this medium is truly multi - phase , consisting of @xmath120k dust distributed over 1020% of the",
    "100150 kpc wide system volume , co - existing with the largest lyman-@xmath4 halo known along with cooler dust , magnetic fields , intense uv flux from massive star formation , and flooded by x - ray photons .    as the construction site of a massive galaxy , and",
    "almost certainly what will become the core of a massive cluster of galaxies , this system directly illustrates the extent to which astrophysics helps mold the nature of the relatively quiet cluster environments we see today .",
    "the radio observations of 4c41.17 suggest that it is surrounded by a large mass of gas , which would be a significant component in the icm of any present - day cluster , although it has yet to be heated or compressed sufficiently at @xmath0 to be visible in the x - ray waveband .",
    "the coincidence of this phase of growth with the wide range of energetic phenomenae we observe in 4c41.17 suggest that these phenomenae may play a role in setting the final physical characteristics of the icm  such as establishing a minimum entropy for gas in clusters at the present - day .",
    "future x - ray observations of other high - z radio galaxies will lead to a more unified picture of energetics and feedback mechanisms in these systems .",
