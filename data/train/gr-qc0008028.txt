    "<S> it is shown that the interaction of helicity-1 waves of gravity and matter in a thin slab configuration produces new types of instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a spin-2 helicity-1 mode interacts strongly with the shear motion of matter . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is unstable above a critical wavelength , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with jeans wavelength , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the sound speed . </S>",
    "<S> the two instabilities are of course different . for the case analyzed , a plane parallel configuration , jeans instability appears through a density wave perturbation , the material collapsing into a set of plane - parallel slabs . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the helicity-1 wave instability induces a transverse motion in the fluid that tends to shear in the material along the node of the perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 4.30.-w , 4.30.nk    acoustic waves are affected by gravitational forces . </S>",
    "<S> one of the consequences is jeans instability @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) produced above a certain critical wavelength . there is an electromagnetic counterpart in plasma density waves . in the limit of large wavelengths </S>",
    "<S> their frequency square tends to a finite positive value , and the plasma acquires the plasma frequency , whereas in the jeans case the frequency square turns negative . </S>",
    "<S> this is noted by weinberg @xcite but he does not go further . </S>",
    "<S> plasma density waves can be seen as longitudinal electromagnetic waves which are not possible in vacuum but are present in media with the plasma frequency having the role of a photon mass . by the same token acoustic waves </S>",
    "<S> can be identified with longitudinal waves of the gravity field but now , instead , they possess an imaginary mass . </S>",
    "<S> transverse electromagnetic waves , in addition to longitudinal waves , are also modified in a plasma and acquire a mass equal to the plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the questions posed in this paper concern waves of the gravity field , or wave metric perturbations , propagating in matter . more specifically , we are interested in the following question : are there waves which get a finite real mass or do they get an imaginary mass leading to instabilities other than jeans ?    waves of the gravity field can be classified according to their spin and helicity . here </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in spin 2 waves which can have helicities 2 , 1 and 0 . </S>",
    "<S> helicity-2 waves represent radiative gravitational waves and are simply called gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> helicity-1 waves , as well as helicity-0 , do not exist in vacuum but can propagate in matter . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of waves of the gravity field through matter has been studied in two main contexts , namely , cosmological and astrophysical . within the cosmological context </S>",
    "<S> these waves appear as perturbations of the background universe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and there is now a growing interest in the primordial gravitational wave background since it seems possible to detect it in the future @xcite . within the astrophysical context </S>",
    "<S> they have been studied mainly in relation to stars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> usually one considers these stars as either spherically or axisymmetric . the waves in the star , i.e. , perturbed quadrupolar or higher polar modes , appear as convective velocity perturbations and density perturbations which through the stellar boundary match with gravitational waves propagating in vacuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still within the astrophysical context , there has been another line of research , which is the one that most concerns us here , analyzing non - dissipative @xcite and dissipative propagation of waves through matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained so far confine themselves either to the short wavelength limit or to transverse helicity-2 gravitational wave modes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in either case </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of wave and matter is minute , and usually the wave propagates undisturbed .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we want to go a step further , and reach the level where the wavelength , @xmath3 , is of the order of or larger than the background curvature , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is not possible to achieve for spherical or quasi - spherical geometries , since it implies systems with a size of the order of their schwarzschild radius . </S>",
    "<S> however , extended finite thin plates either disk - like or parallelepiped - like are amenable to the large @xmath3 regime . in order to progress </S>",
    "<S> we will study a specific case , namely a wave propagating through a plane parallel slab . </S>",
    "<S> we are then able to find some modes which propagate and truly interact with matter . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse helicity-2 gravitational wave mode propagates freely without interaction as has been observed in several papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a transverse helicity-1 shear wave mode interacts strongly with the shear motion of matter . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , above a certain critical wavelength this mode is unstable , as we will now show .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a fluid with proper energy density @xmath5 , pressure @xmath6 and with a given equation of state @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> consider then it has suffered a small departure from a state where it is at rest in a minkowski space with homogeneous density , @xmath8 , and pressure , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid energy - momentum tensor is ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the 4-velocity vector . </S>",
    "<S> greek indices @xmath13 , etc . , </S>",
    "<S> take values @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the metric @xmath19 is denoted in the minkowski limit as @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid and the gravitational field form a coupled system . the change of @xmath21 due to a fluctuation in the metric is determined by the conservation laws of energy and momentum , @xmath22 and in turn , the gravitational field is determined by the einstein equations @xmath23 one has to distinguish between a static gravitational field , @xmath24 , caused if not for anything else by the fluid at rest , from the wave modes @xmath25 defined as @xmath26 the field @xmath27 is related through einstein equations , @xmath28=8\\pi g ( \\bar{t}_{\\mu\\nu}-\\tfrac{1}{2 } \\bar{g}_{\\mu\\nu }   \\bar{t } ) \\ ; , \\label{quatro}\\ ] ] to the  energy - momentum tensor , @xmath29 , of the fluid in static equilibrium under the external field @xmath27 itself . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is characterized by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which in turn deviate slightly from @xmath8 and @xmath9 , see below .    </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the de donder gauge ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath33 for both @xmath25 and @xmath27 . here and in the following the minkowski metric @xmath34 is used to raise and lower indices of @xmath35 , @xmath27  and @xmath36 . in this gauge </S>",
    "<S> the equations of energy - momentum conservation are in leading order in the gravitational field @xmath37 the limit @xmath38 gives the conservation equations of @xmath39 . after subtracting that static contribution one obtains the equations governing the variations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 induced by the fluctuations @xmath35 . in first order @xmath41 where @xmath42  replaces @xmath29 , an approximation that will be made whenever @xmath30  is multiplied by the field @xmath43 because @xmath44 is already suppressed by @xmath45 . equations ( [ sete ] ) </S>",
    "<S> give the linearized equations ( where , @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 which yield @xmath48  as linear functions of @xmath49 when considering periodic waves . </S>",
    "<S> this system is completed by einstein equations ( [ dois ] ) and ( [ quatro ] ) resulting in the approximate equality , @xmath50-r_{\\mu \\nu } [ \\bar{h}]=8\\pi g\\left ( \\tau _ { \\mu \\nu } - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\eta _ { \\mu \\nu } ( \\tau -t_{\\alpha \\beta } ^{(0)}\\,h^{\\alpha \\beta } ) -\\tfrac{1}{2}t^{(0)}h_{\\mu \\nu } \\right ) \\ ; , \\label{nove}\\ ] ] where the traces are defined as @xmath51and @xmath52 . in the right - hand side </S>",
    "<S> we neglect terms that go as , omiting the indices , @xmath53 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , because they are suppressed by extra factors of @xmath56 and henceforth only appear at @xmath57 order .    in the weak field limit the left - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nove ] ) is approximated by @xmath58 whereas in the right hand side the explicit dependence of the matter terms in @xmath59 is neglected . in the study of the propagation of gravitational waves through matter one usually considers the high frequency regime , where the wavenumber @xmath60 is much greater than the background curvature , i.e. , @xmath61 , enabling one to neglect in the equations the matter density @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , matter effects become important when @xmath62 approaches the background curvature , i.e. , @xmath63 . for such small @xmath60 higher order terms of the ricci tensor , such as @xmath64 , are of the same order as @xmath65 and still linear in @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a higher order expansion of the ricci tensor in equation ( [ nove ] ) up to terms linear in both @xmath59 and background field @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> such an expansion includes products of @xmath56 derivatives and @xmath59 derivatives and products of @xmath56 times second derivatives of @xmath59 so that translational invariance is lost and monochromatic waves cease to be in general solutions of einstein equations . </S>",
    "<S> this may be circumvented in some cases , such as in the solutions presented below .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a thin wall of fluid lying over the plane @xmath67 with translational symmetry along the @xmath68 plane . </S>",
    "<S> if the pressure is everywhere much smaller than the density the einstein equations ( [ quatro ] ) admit in first order a newtonian solution @xmath69 with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> consider in addition that the fluid is in a nearly incompressible state , i.e. , with a practically uniform density @xmath71 . a solution with reflection symmetry about the plane @xmath67 possess an acceleration @xmath72 and pressure @xmath73 , @xmath74 vanishing at the boundary planes @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the density variation is negligible across the wall if @xmath76 for a given speed of sound @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> that is true if the wall thickness @xmath77 obeys @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the jeans wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> note that the non - relativistic condition @xmath80 is a weaker condition since it implies @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the potential @xmath82 at the wall depends upon the longitudinal dimension of the wall , @xmath83 , because at distances larger than @xmath83 it decays with the inverse distance to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath84 at the wall . therefore the newtonian condition @xmath85 yields @xmath86 . to summarize , the background we are assuming consists of a fluid with uniform density and small pressure associated with a newtonian gravity potential . </S>",
    "<S> other details , such as the precise fall off of the pressure at the rim of the wall , are no needed here .    to obtain from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nove ] ) an accurate system of linear equations in @xmath35 up to order of @xmath87 it is sufficient to have @xmath88 in leading order of @xmath87 in the left - hand side of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nove ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are terms proportional to @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> we consider waves propagating along the @xmath92 axis , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath25 varying as @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that for large enough wavelengths the terms proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 are much smaller than the terms with @xmath97 so that solutions of that type may be found by neglecting the @xmath98 and @xmath96 terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is not enough however that @xmath99 and @xmath100 be much smaller than @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the three kinds of terms mix in the bianchi identities and therefore one should not expect that the einstein equations remain always consistent with each other if some terms are neglected . nevertheless two modes were found that provide consistent solutions of einstein equations with definite wavelength along the @xmath92 axis . </S>",
    "<S> they are @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    after neglecting the @xmath104 and @xmath82 terms ( and pressure ) eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nove ] ) give for the @xmath102 mode @xmath105 while the fluid equations of motion ( [ oitoa ] ) and ( [ oitob ] ) yield @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath102 mode satisfies @xmath107 and propagates at the vacuum speed of light without disturbing the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> this absence of dispersion is in agreement with various previous results regarding the propagation of transverse gravitational waves in media ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath108 and @xmath109 mode ( @xmath110 in the gauge ( [ cinco ] ) ) eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nove ] ) give , after neglecting the @xmath98 and @xmath96 terms as before : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the momentum density along the @xmath113 direction and the fluid velocity is @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> the terms proportional to @xmath115 and @xmath116 are due to the background curvature @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid equations of motion ( [ oitoa ] ) and ( [ oitob ] ) yield @xmath118 hence , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dispersion relation is @xmath121 in contrast to the @xmath102 , this @xmath122 mode exhibits an instability at very large wavelengths , @xmath123 , that is induced by matter . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , the polarization carries the helicity states @xmath124 and not @xmath125 , in contrast to the gravitational waves that propagate in vacuum . in vacuum , of course , this mode can be gauged away through a coordinate transformation but that is no longer true in matter as can be seen by the following argument : @xmath109 can be eliminated with a transformation of the type @xmath126 but @xmath108 transforms into @xmath127 , which is not zero , because the phase velocity @xmath128 is different from unit in matter . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one may gauge away @xmath129and @xmath108 but not @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to prove that no coordinate transformation can bring simultaneously all the components @xmath25 and @xmath131 into zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the fluid can be characterized in a gauge independent way by the covariant derivative of the velocity , @xmath132 ( see @xcite ) . in leading order , </S>",
    "<S> the important non - zero covariant derivatives are @xmath133 it means that this is a shear motion , @xmath134 , with the square of the shear magnitude defined as the gauge invariant quantity @xmath135 . in the gauge we use , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath136 which shows again the crucial role played by matter . </S>",
    "<S> these helicity-1 waves can then be called shear waves . </S>",
    "<S> the components @xmath137 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 correspond to what are called vector perturbations in cosmological perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are interpreted as a relativistic generalization of purely rotational fluid flow . here , </S>",
    "<S> they appear exclusively associated to pure shear motion . </S>",
    "<S> the vorticity for this mode is zero , since its relevant covariant velocity component @xmath138 ( indeed , from euler equations : @xmath139 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now discuss the two main aspects of this problem : the first aspect concerns the physics of the instability , and the second the generation and propagation of stable waves .    </S>",
    "<S> starting with the first aspect , one notices from equation ( [ quinze ] ) , that the instability sets in through an @xmath140 mode , with a critical wave number @xmath141 , where the speed of light @xmath142 has been restored . in terms of wavelength , above the critical value @xmath143 , i.e. , for @xmath144 the system is unstable , @xmath145 being the marginal case . </S>",
    "<S> this instability tends to shear in the material along the node of the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , under the effect of the wave the particles of the fluid get an acceleration @xmath146 that produces the velocity @xmath119 . as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , one sees that part of the material moves to one side , part to the other , whereas it stays at rest at the node where the velocity in the @xmath113direction , @xmath147 , is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> a very important point which should be made explicitly clear is that at such critical wavelengths there are equilibrium configurations which are not at all dynamically unstable . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in a previous paragraph we have put the following limits on the equilibrium configuration , @xmath148 and @xmath149 . to have @xmath150 while the above conditions are still satisfied </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath77 has to satisfy both limits @xmath151 and @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for sufficiently small thickness @xmath77 , there are well defined equilibria .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    in order to better understand such an instability it is advisable to rearrange equation ( [ dezasseis ] ) above and write it as @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the mass per unit length in the @xmath113direction and @xmath155 is the reference relativistic mass associated with the thickness length @xmath77 . thus @xmath156 can be seen as the relativistic reference mass per unit length in the @xmath157direction . </S>",
    "<S> the instability criterion ( [ dezasseis ] ) says that when the mass per unit length in the @xmath113direction of the perturbation is about greater than the reference mass per unit length in the @xmath157direction then the momentum in the @xmath113direction is enough to overcome the pull back from the mass along @xmath92 and the material breaks apart .    </S>",
    "<S> this instability is of course different from jeans instability but not quite in what regards the gravitational field dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ catorzea ] ) can be written as @xmath158 , because @xmath159 , and if one performs a lorentz boost along the @xmath113direction , it is equivalent to @xmath160 in the new frame , which is comparable to the equation governing the response of the gravitational field to density fluctuations . what is different is that they are not accompanied by perturbations in the fluid proper density and pressure as in the jeans , acoustic case , but rather by transverse displacements of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> for such a plane layer and density wave perturbations of the form @xmath161 , jeans instability sets in when @xmath162 with @xmath163 , or @xmath164 with @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> the material collapses into a set of plane - parallel slabs distributed perpendicularly to the @xmath157direction and uniformly along the @xmath157 direction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the instability we have found here sets in through the interaction of shear waves and matter . a helicity-1 shear wave travelling through the plane parallel layer in the @xmath157direction with @xmath166 will induce an instability in the matter and in the gravitational field itself . for </S>",
    "<S> a planar slab characterized by a surface density @xmath167 and height @xmath168 one can write the critical wavelength as @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that @xmath170 can be relatively small for high enough surface densities or very thin systems . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if such instabilities are not detectable within the system , one can put a lower limit on the ratio @xmath171 ; for a slab with size @xmath83 these instabilities do not show up if @xmath172 , i.e. , @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of @xmath170 for our galaxy yields @xmath174kpc showing that it is not thin enough to present such instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> however , for extended and very thin systems this instability is applicable and could set in .    within plane parallel symmetric configurations , </S>",
    "<S> other unstable modes should occur , although we have been able to solve the system consistently only for the @xmath122 mode because we have restricted this study to plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to find a consistent solution for the mode involving @xmath175 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered here plane parallel symmetry but other type of configurations , such as disk - like , should also possess such instabilities . for disk - like configurations some other features and new global instabilities could set in . </S>",
    "<S> jeans instabilities show surprises in the disk - like case , since for high enough values of the sound speed a disk is stable to all axisymmetric perturbations @xcite , a feature that does not appear in the spherical and planar cases . </S>",
    "<S> domain walls and cosmic strings should be considered . in a preliminary calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that domain walls also present this type of instability to wave perturbations of the gravity and scalar field @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the spherical case is less interesting since here @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the schwarzschild radius of an object of radius @xmath178 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the instability sets in when @xmath179 , and other stronger dynamical instabilities must already be present .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the second aspect , i.e. , the generation and propagation of stable waves of helicity-1 . in order to estimate the energy flux of these waves we use the expression for the effective stress - energy @xmath180 tensor given in @xcite and apply to our case . </S>",
    "<S> it yields @xmath181 where the symbol @xmath182 denotes an average over one wave period . defining @xmath183 , with @xmath184 being the amplitude of the velocity in the @xmath113direction </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the velocity of propagation of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> it is now difficult to estimate at this point a realistic energy flux , given one has to deal with the propagation as well as the generation of such a wave . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to have a source of mass @xmath187 in an oscillatory ( orbital ) movement of radius @xmath188 , inducing tidal motions on particles at a distance @xmath189 . </S>",
    "<S> this induces a tidal velocity to the particles which we identify with @xmath184 , given then by @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192g/@xmath193 we obtain @xmath194 and , for @xmath195 , an energy flux @xmath196erg/(s@xmath197@xmath198 ) . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps , the most important point is to notice that this tidal perturbation propagates away through the matter at typically the speed of light according to the dispersion relation ( [ quinze ] ) and properties we have derived for this helicity-1 wave . </S>",
    "<S> one can then think that randomly distributed waves of the type considered , should induce thermal motions in the matter , which would be detected as velocity dispersions in the stars or particles of the system . </S>",
    "<S> these velocities , in turn , would give the impression of the existence of an extra newtonian gravitational potential which , for instance , could be interpreted as coming from dark matter , or from modifications of the gravitational potential itself .    the propagation of these helicity-1 shear waves and the instabilities themselves we have been studying here can be considered wave detectors in potential and deserve close attention . </S>"
