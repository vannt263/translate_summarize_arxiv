    "recent measurements by the taps collaboration @xcite at the mami accelerator of the @xmath0-meson photoproduction on deuterium and helium indicate an enhancement of the total inclusive cross section at photon energies close to the reaction threshold .",
    "the data were specifically collected with high statistical accuracy in order to clarify the first observation  @xcite of the rather large total cross section in that energy regime .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite that such a threshold enhancement could result either from the formation of the quasi bound @xmath0-nucleus state or from the interaction between the final nucleons .",
    "indeed , a strong influence of the final state interaction ( fsi ) on the cross sections of @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath5-meson production in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) collisions was observed in experiments at the iucf , cosy and celsius accelerator facilities  @xcite . with the exception of the @xmath0 channel ,",
    "those experiments producing mesons in @xmath6 collisions can be described almost perfectly by theoretical calculations accounting only for the final state interactions between the nucleons  @xcite . in case of @xmath0 production",
    "there is evidence that the @xmath2 fsi could play a role as well  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the taps data can be understood in terms of the strong neutron - proton ( @xmath7 ) fsi and possibly an @xmath2 fsi .    however , recent calculations  @xcite which include the @xmath7 as well as the @xmath8 final state interactions underestimate the cross section for the reaction @xmath9 at photon energies close to the threshold . within a different approach , three body calculations  @xcite of the reaction @xmath9 performed by the same authors reproduce the main features of the experimental data , but again do not explain the rather large total cross section near the reaction threshold . on the other hand , an older calculation of the reaction @xmath9 performed by ueda  @xcite , which considers the formation of a quasi bound @xmath10 state , leads to a much too strong enhancement of the production cross section close to threshold , and is ruled out by the taps data .",
    "therefore , the explanation of the taps data is still open and needs further investigations .    here",
    "we evaluate the reaction @xmath9 within the impulse approximation .",
    "in addition we account for the fsi between the neutron and proton by employing the most recent cd - bonn potential  @xcite . in sect .",
    "2 we specify the elementary @xmath11 amplitude which serves as input for our calculation of the reaction @xmath9 . specifically , we assume that the elementary @xmath0-production proceeds via the excitation of the @xmath12 @xmath13 resonance",
    ". the free parameters of our model are fixed by a fit to available data for the reaction @xmath14 . in sect .",
    "3 we provide some details about the evaluation of the reaction amplitude for @xmath9 and present results for the impulse approximation as well as for the inclusion of the fsi in the @xmath7 system .",
    "possible effects from the @xmath2 fsi are discussed in sect .",
    "in addition we provide predictions for the angular spectrum and for the momentum spectrum of the produced @xmath0 meson for selected incident photon energies in the vicinity of the @xmath0-production threshold .",
    "the section ends with a brief summary of our results .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath0-meson photoproduction from a nucleon is given by the @xmath12 isobar excitation  @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the nucleon s - channel pole term nor @xmath16-channel vector meson exchanges , since their contributions were found to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "the square of the invariant collision energy of the reaction @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the nucleon mass and the photon energy , respectively .",

    "@xcite .",
    "following the analysis of pion photoproduction , we account for the energy dependence of the hadronic widths  @xcite in order to satisfy the threshold dependence  @xcite of the multipole amplitudes of the outgoing meson momentum @xmath36 .",
    "the energy dependence of the partial width for each final meson @xmath37 is given as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 partial resonance width at the resonance pole , while @xmath41 is given by  @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the blatt - weisskopf function for the orbital angular momentum @xmath29 .",

    "in addition , the total energy - dependent resonance width is given by the sum over the partial widths of all available final states .    in principle",
    ", one may consider the contributions from the resonances @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath13 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and higher mass resonances to the photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons @xcite and evaluate the resonance parameters from the available differential cross section data and recoil nucleon polarization data @xcite .",
    "contributions from @xmath52-wave resonances provide an isotropic angular spectrum @xmath53 of @xmath0-mesons , with @xmath54 denoting the @xmath0-meson emission angle in the c.m . system .",
    "the @xmath55-wave resonances contribute proportionally to @xmath56 , while the @xmath57-wave resonances result in a @xmath58 dependence .",
    "although contributions from higher partial waves to the total photoproduction cross section of @xmath0-mesons can be very small , they can be evaluated from the differential @xmath53 cross section with the help of interference terms .",
    "however , most recent data  @xcite for differential cross sections of the reaction @xmath59 at photon energies from 716 to 788  mev indicate that , within the experimental errors , the angular spectrum is dominated almost entirely by the @xmath52-wave distribution . estimated contributions from @xmath55 and @xmath57-wave resonances can be given only at very low confidence level  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , data on the nucleon recoil polarization , which in principle must be sensitive to the resonant contribution  @xcite , have large uncertainties and are thus not significant .    since there is no strong experimental evidence  @xcite for contributions to the @xmath0-meson photoproduction from resonances other than the @xmath13 resonance in the near - threshold region",
    ", we will consider in the following only this resonance .",
    "the partial decay widths , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are related to the relevant coupling constant @xmath62 , @xmath63 , by @xmath64 here the momentum @xmath36 and the nucleon energy @xmath65 are evaluated in the rest frame of the resonance at the pole position of @xmath13 .",
    "considering only the contribution of the @xmath13 resonance , the data for @xmath0-meson photoproduction off protons can be well fitted with the following resonance parameters at the @xmath13 pole : @xmath66 for the electromagnetic helicity amplitudes in eq .",
    "[ helicities ] we use the values @xmath67 = 0.124 @xmath68 and @xmath69 = -0.1 @xmath68 .",
    "the result of this fit for the total cross section for the reaction @xmath59 is displayed in fig .",
    "using the impulse approximation ( ia ) the amplitude @xmath71 of the reaction @xmath9 for given spin @xmath52 and isospin @xmath72 of the final nucleons can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for the deuteron wave function and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the momentum of the proton or neutron in the deuteron rest frame .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 denotes the isoscalar or isovector photoproduction amplitude at the squared invariant energy @xmath78 given by @xmath79 our calculation within the framework of the ia is shown in fig .",
    "[ mainz2 ] and corresponds to the dashed line .",
    "it describes the data  @xcite at photon energies above @xmath80680  mev reasonably well .",
    "close to the reaction threshold , however , the ia result substantially underestimates the data .",
    "we take this as an indication that effects from the ( @xmath6 and/or @xmath2 ) final state interaction play an important role here . indeed , as already mentioned in the introduction , it is well known from meson production in @xmath6 collisions that close to threshold fsi effects lead to a significant modification of the cross section .    in meson production in @xmath6 collisions",
    "fsi effects result predominantly from strong @xmath52-wave interactions in the outgoing @xmath6 system .",
    "therefore , we will take into account this contribution for the reaction @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is given by @xmath81 here @xmath22 is the nucleon momentum in the final @xmath7 system and @xmath82 is the half - shell @xmath7 scattering matrix in the @xmath83 and @xmath84 partial waves . in the calculations presented here ,",
    "the half - shell t - matrix is obtained at corresponding on - shell momenta @xmath22 from the latest cd - bonn potential @xcite , which describes the @xmath6 data base with a @xmath85/datum of about 1 . in order to find out if a high precision description of the @xmath6 data , in our specific case the @xmath6 s - waves , is crucial , we carried out the calculations with an older one - boson - exchange model , obepq @xcite , also describing the s - waves reasonably well .",
    "we found the difference of those two calculations being negligible .",
    "the total cross section @xmath9 including the @xmath7 fsi in @xmath52-waves is displayed in fig .",
    "[ mainz2 ] as solid line .",
    "now the model calculation describes the data  @xcite reasonably well and lies , in fact , within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "as expected , the fsi interaction gives rise to a significant increase of the production cross section close to threshold as is required for getting agreement with the data .",
    "in @xmath0-production experiments in @xmath86 as well as in @xmath7 collisions one has observed that there is an even stronger enhancement of the production cross section close to threshold , which can not be explained by fsi effects from the @xmath6 interaction alone  @xcite .",
    "this additional enhancement is , in general , seen as an indication of fsi effects due to the @xmath2 interaction  @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be suggested that similar effects are seen in the reaction @xmath9 . in order to expose a possible influence from the @xmath2 fsi we again show the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fsio ] , but now divide them by our model calculation , which includes the enhancement from the fsi between the nucleons . any effects from the @xmath2 fsi present in the data would then reveal themselves as additional enhancement .",
    "indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fsio ] , there is a deviation from our calculation for energies very close to threshold , which may be interpreted as being caused by an @xmath2 fsi , though the error bars are large .",
    "it is interesting to mention , that the magnitude and also the energy range of this deviation are comparable to the effects seen in @xmath0-production via hadronic probes . in the reactions",
    "@xmath87 as well as in @xmath88 the observed additional enhancement very close to threshold was a factor of 2 to 3 , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , and the enhancement was limited to excess energies below roughly 15 mev for the former and roughly 10 mev for the latter reaction . in any case",
    ", it would be very useful to have data with higher statistics available at those energies very close to threshold in order to chart the possible enhancement due to the @xmath2 fsi more accurately @xcite .",
    "angular spectra of @xmath0-mesons in the photon - deuteron rest frame are shown for different photon energies in fig .",
    "[ mainz5a ] .",
    "the ia calculation underestimates the data at @xmath20=627 - 665  mev , but already reasonably reproduces experimental results at 665 - 705  mev .",
    "momentum spectra of the @xmath0-mesons in the @xmath89 rest frame at different photon energies are displayed in fig .",
    "[ mainz5b ] . at the lower photon energy , 627 - 665  mev ,",
    "the ia calculation differs considerably from the full calculation including fsi .",
    "the latter leads to a significant enhancement of the yield for larger @xmath0 momenta .",
    "this is not surprising because in this case the @xmath0-meson carries away much of the available kinetic energy and the @xmath6 system emerges with a small relative momentum , and the interaction is particularly strong .",
    "this enhancement at large @xmath0 momentum is clearly seen in the new still preliminary data of the taps collaboration @xcite . as the photon energy increases , the difference between the ia and the calculation including the @xmath6 fsi becomes smaller . at a photon energy of 665 - 705  mev ,",
    "the effect of the fsi has basically vanished , consistent with the observations in fig .  2 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the theoretical results displayed in figs .",
    "[ mainz5a],[mainz5b ] represent an average over a finite energy interval .",
    "this is done in order to make the predictions comparable to the experiments where likewise an averaging over energy bins is made @xcite .",
    "specifically for the momentum distribution of the @xmath0 meson this averaging has a significant influence on the results .",
    "the maximal @xmath0-momentum available at a given fixed photon energy for the reaction @xmath9 is defined by @xmath90 ^ 2,m_\\eta^2)}{2\\sqrt{s}},\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is defined in eq .",
    "averaging over the photon energy leads to a smearing of @xmath92 .",
    "since the @xmath6 fsi is most strongly felt for @xmath0 momenta close to @xmath92 its effect is also smeared out by averaging over @xmath20 as is the case with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ mainz5b ] .",
    "predictions for a sharp incident photon energy show a much stronger structure due to fsi as is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ mainz6 ] .",
    "clearly , this suggests that a high enery resolution in the experiments is very desirable if one wants to see and study effects from the fsi .",
    "we calculated the reaction @xmath93 including the dominant @xmath13 resonance and the neutron - proton final state interaction .",
    "we find that the impulse approximation reproduces the cross section for inclusive photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons and the @xmath0-meson angular spectrum quite well for energies around 680  mev and higher . at lower energies",
    "the consideration of the fsi between the outgoing nucleons is necessary to describe the relative enhancement of the cross - section data with respect to the impulse approximation .",
    "though the @xmath6 fsi accounts for a large part of the observed enhancement , our analysis suggests that there is still a remaining discrepancy with regard to the data for very small excess energies .",
    "this discrepancy is of similar size as found in the @xmath0-production in @xmath6 collisions and may be taken as signature of the @xmath2 final state interaction very close to threshold .",
