    "the appearance of reflection asymmetric shapes in atomic nuclei is associated in the geometric model framework with the manifestation of octupole degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the specific physical characteristics of systems with reflection asymmetry are related to the violation of the @xmath5- symmetry ( @xmath5 is the operator of a rotation by @xmath6 about an axis rectangular to a symmetry axis of the system ) and the @xmath7- symmetry [ @xmath7 is the space inversion ( parity ) operator ] .",
    "it is known that while these symmetries are violated separately , the system can be still invariant with respect to the product operator @xmath8@xmath9 @xcite",
    ". then the spectrum of the system is characterized with the presence of energy bands in which the parity changes alternatively with the angular momentum .",
    "the best examples of such alternating parity bands , called also octupole bands , are known in the region of light actinide nuclei rn , ra and th @xcite .",
    "although the general structure of the observed spectra unambiguously indicates the presence of reflection asymmetry , the detailed analysis of experimental data suggests the manifestation of a more complicated collective dynamics .",
    "thus , a strong parity shift effect is observed in the region of low angular momenta @xmath10 .",
    "the negative parity levels appear above the neighboring even levels with energy @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and so on . near @xmath13",
    "the shift effect rapidly decreases and further at higher angular momenta ( up to @xmath14 ) a single collective octupole band with normally ordered levels is formed . in such a way the data suggest a specific evolution of collectivity with angular momentum .",
    "the properties of nuclei with octupole degrees of freedom have been extensively studied within various geometric , algebraic and microscopic model approaches in nuclear structure ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the alternating parity bands have been described in several recent works , most of them covering the low and medium angular momenta @xmath15 @xcite and some of them reaching the higher region of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these works provide specific model explanations of the properties of octupole deformed nuclei .",
    "however , the dynamical mechanism which governs the complete angular momentum evolution of octupole collectivity remains to be understood .",
    "still , the considerable change in the structure of the spectrum from the low - spin region ( @xmath16 ) to the medium ( @xmath17 ) and higher ( @xmath18 ) angular momenta needs an explanation .",
    "this is quite clear in view of the `` beat '' odd - even ( @xmath19 ) staggering patterns observed in the octupole bands of light actinide nuclei @xcite .",
    "they correspond to a zigzagging behavior of the odd - even energy difference as a discrete function of @xmath20 with changing amplitude and presence of one or more zero - amplitude points .",
    "another important circumstance that should be taken into account is that the octupole deformation appears as a superposition on the top of the quadrupole deformation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should consider a system with a complicated quadrupole - octupole shape .",
    "a prescription for the most general hamiltonian of the quadrupole - octupole deformed system is given in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the pauli quantization procedure applied to a generalized bohr hamiltonian , including the octupole degrees of freedom , with a subsequent transformation to the body fixed frame .",
    "having in mind the above remarks , we suggest that the _ complete structure _ of alternating parity bands can be interpreted within the following general framework . in the low - energy region",
    "the system can be characterized by oscillations of the octupole shape between two opposite orientations , which we call _ soft octupole mode _ , and by simultaneous rotations of the entire quadrupole  octupole shape .",
    "the parity shift is then the result of the tunnelling between the two reflection asymmetric shape orientations separated by an angular momentum dependent potential barrier @xcite . with the increase of the angular momentum the energy barrier increases and suppresses respectively the tunnelling effect and the shape oscillations .",
    "in such a way a _ stable _ quadrupole  octupole shape is formed . at the high angular momenta , the parity effect is completely reduced , and there the properties of collective motion can be associated with the rotation of a stable quadrupole ",
    "octupole shape @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide a model formalism capable to describe the strong parity shift in the low - lying spectra together with the fine rotational band structure developed at higher angular momenta .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a double - well potential with an angular momentum dependent energy barrier induced by a centrifugal term and by using the hamiltonian of the point - symmetry based quadrupole - octupole rotation model ( qorm ) @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", the formalism of the soft octupole mode is developed and in section 3 the formalism of qorm is discussed . in section 4 ,",
    "results of the application of both schemes , soft octupole mode and qorm , to spectra of several light actinide nuclei are presented . in section 5 , concluding remarks are given .",
    "the model frame for the description of the parity shift effect in nuclei with octupole deformations can be defined through the following main assumptions :    \\i ) the parity shift in octupole bands is determined by the oscillation of the system with respect to a deformation variable @xmath21 in a symmetric double - well potential centered at @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 is related to the axial octupole deformation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "\\ii ) the potential barrier increases with the increase of the angular momentum @xmath20 as the result of a centrifugal interaction with a deformation dependent moment of inertia .",
    "\\iii ) the octupole deformation @xmath24 in the minimum of the potential does not change with the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , with increasing @xmath20 the octupole shape `` stabilizes '' to a fixed octupole deformation .",
    "\\iv ) the parity shift can be extracted from the potential energy by excluding the contribution of the rotation mode .",
    "the rotation degrees of freedom can be considered separately without double counting in the potential energy .",
    "\\v ) for given @xmath20 the intrinsic state is determined by the lowest level in the potential whose parity @xmath6 together with the @xmath5- symmetry of the rotation wave function , @xmath25 , conserves the total @xmath8@xmath9-symmetry , @xmath26 .",
    "thus for @xmath27even the intrinsic state of the system is determined by the first level @xmath28 in the potential with @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath27odd it is determined by the second level @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian for oscillations in the octupole shape ( the soft octupole mode ) can be taken in the general form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an effective octupole mass parameter .",
    "the potential @xmath34 is determined as follows .",
    "we consider the angular momentum dependent potential @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 can be associated to the moment of inertia of the system taken in the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are constants .",
    "such a dependence can be explained through the moment of inertia of an axial symmetric quadrupole - octupole shape , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the quadrupole and octupole deformation parameters , respectively @xcite . for a stable quadrupole deformation , @xmath42",
    ", @xmath43 reduces to the above form of @xmath36 , and the potential ( [ ubetai ] ) reads @xmath44 with @xmath45 . for @xmath46 , the shape of the potential ( [ ubeta ] ) represents a double well with a potential barrier centered at @xmath22 .",
    "the term quadratic in @xmath21 generates oscillations of the reflection asymmetric ( octupole ) shape between two opposite orientations of the system , providing a parity shift effect in the collective energy .",
    "the second term in ( [ ubeta ] ) corresponds to a centrifugal interaction generating a potential barrier .",
    "the height of the barrier increases with increasing @xmath20 and suppresses respectively the parity shift .",
    "we remark that double - well potentials without angular momentum dependence of the potential barrier have been considered in earlier works @xcite .",
    "some general properties of angular momentum dependent double - well potentials have been discussed in references @xcite . a spin - dependent potential with a centrifugal term similar to that in ( [ ubeta ] ) has been applied in @xcite in reference to the phase transitions in nuclei with octupole degrees of freedom .",
    "following the assumption iii ) , we consider that the potential @xmath47 has a minimum at some fixed value of @xmath48 .",
    "the extremum condition @xmath49 gives @xmath50 thus , the requirement for a fixed potential minimum in the octupole deformation imposes an angular momentum dependence of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the substitution of equation  ( [ cl ] ) into ( [ ubeta ] ) , leads to the following form of the octupole potential @xmath52\\ . \\label{octfixl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to eliminate ( according to assumption iv ) the angular momentum ( rotation ) dependence of the origin of the energy scale we determine the potential as @xmath53 , @xmath54 the evolution of the potential ( [ octfix ] ) with the angular momentum is demonstrated in figure  1 .",
    "it is seen that , the increase in the potential barrier with @xmath20 is associated with a respective decrease in the width of the potential well .",
    "this corresponds to an increasing stiffness of the system , and therefore , to a rapid stabilization of the shape in the higher angular momenta .",
    "we determine the energy levels @xmath28 and @xmath30 [ according to the assumption v ) ] in the potential @xmath55 [ equation  ( [ octfix ] ) ] by solving numerically the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ schro ] ) .",
    "these energies still carry a rotation input due to the narrowing of the potential minima .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , the both levels increase with @xmath20 .",
    "to estimate analytically this dependence we approximate the shapes of the potential minima by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "the lowest energy level in this potential is @xmath58 it approximates the overall increase of the levels @xmath28 and @xmath30 as demonstrated in figure 2 .",
    "thus , to _ keep only the parity dependence in the intrinsic energy _ according to assumption iv ) , and _ not the part nearly linearly increasing with @xmath20 _",
    "one should set the energy of the octupole shape oscillations in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "thus the intrinsic energy related to octupole degrees of freedom is separated in a part independent of the angular momentum , and an `` alternating '' part , which takes into account the shift down ( for @xmath27even ) and the shift up ( for @xmath27odd ) of the intrinsic `` octupole '' energy with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "so , equation  ( [ elowvib ] ) approximates the _ non - rotational _ part of the energy in the alternating parity bands .",
    "the angular momentum dependence of @xmath62 is demonstrated in figure  3(a ) .",
    "we see that in the low spin region it exhibits a strongly oscillating behavior . with increasing @xmath20",
    "the oscillations rapidly vanish and @xmath63 is reduced to the constant @xmath61 . in figure  3(b ) we illustrate the contribution of @xmath62 to the higher order staggering quantity @xmath64 where @xmath65 . as it is seen from figure  3(b ) , for @xmath66 , this quantity shows a well developed staggering pattern with a rapidly decreasing magnitude similar to what is observed in the low spin region of alternating parity bands in light actinide nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , while the solutions of the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( [ schro ] ) suggest a complete disappearance of the parity shift and the respective staggering after some point , the experimental data show @xcite more complicated `` beat '' patterns with the presence of further staggering regions at higher angular momenta .",
    "this additional staggering regions can not be explained by the octupole oscillation mode .",
    "their presence can be attributed to the properties of a rotating system with a stable quadrupole - octupole deformation which will be considered in the next section .",

    "the following comments on the obtained results have to be made .",
    "\\i ) the model description reproduces correctly the points with near zero staggering amplitude , which separate the different beat regions in the staggering patterns . in this way",
    "the model formalism clearly identifies the angular momentum region where the two _ separate sequences _ of negative and positive parity levels merge into a _",
    "octupole rotational band .",
    "we note that both modes , the soft octupole and the stable quadrupole ",
    "octupole , fit to each other quite consistently .",
    "\\ii ) as a consequence of i ) , our results show that the complicated odd - even staggering structure of alternating parity bands can be explained as the result of two consistently manifesting dynamical effects in the nucleus .",
    "the one is the parity splitting effect due to oscillations in the orientation ( tunnelling effect ) of the octupole shape and the other is the  beat ",
    "staggering effect due to the angular momentum properties ( with the specific sequences of @xmath84-values described in the end of section 3 ) of the rotating quadrupole  octupole shape .",
    "so , our model description suggests that in the low angular momentum region of the spectrum the staggering effect is mainly due to the parity effect , while in the higher spin region the beat staggering structure of the band is due to the rotating complex shape . in this aspect the first `` zero '' in the staggering amplitude",
    "can be attributed to a transition angular momentum region where the nuclear collectivity changes from the soft octupole to the stable rotation behavior .",
    "\\iii ) the successful reproduction of the second and the third beat regions in the staggering patterns of @xmath108ra and @xmath109ra provides a useful theoretical tool for the analysis and prediction of collective band structure at high angular momenta .",
    "this is a result of the model mechanism presented in the end of section 3 .",
    "according to the explanation given there , the presence of second , third and further `` zeros '' in the staggering amplitude can be interpreted as the result of respective irregularities in the yrast @xmath84-sequences .",
    "our calculations predict that the third staggering region in @xmath108ra ( figure 4 ) could be completed near @xmath110 and a fourth region could be expected if further experimental data are obtained . in @xmath109ra",
    "( figure 5 ) , again an additional third beat is expected near @xmath110 . in @xmath108th ( figure 6 ) the prediction suggests that the second staggering region could be continued in the region @xmath111 , while in @xmath109th ( figure 7 ) the expectation is that a second staggering region can take place for @xmath112 .",
    "so , any further experimental data in these spectra will be of great interest to test the model predictions .",

    "the other considered nuclei @xmath105 obtains zero values .",
    "the appearance of a non - zero value of @xmath105 can be related to the recently suggested shape phase transition between the regions of octupole deformations and octupole vibrations @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the nuclei @xmath109ra and @xmath109th are closely placed to the transition point . in this",
    "meaning the presence of triaxiality could be interpreted as the sign of the transition from octupole deformation to octupole vibration .",
    "the following comments on the applied model approach and its further development should take a place here .",
    "\\i ) although the total number of used model parameters looks large , their numerical values in the different nuclei vary in quite narrow limits ( see the values shown in figures 4 - 7 ) .",
    "we could keep some of them ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) as overall constants similarly to the mass parameter @xmath33 , without essential loss of accuracy .",
    "however , at the current stage of study we prefer to consider them as the output of the fitting procedure because of their clear physical meaning .",
    "this consideration holds especially for the parameter @xmath24 which provides a direct model prediction for the octupole deformations of nuclei .",
    "actually it could be related to the qorm hamiltonian parameter @xmath104 through the nuclear moment of inertia . as a consequence a possible change in @xmath24 with increasing angular momentum could be allowed .",
    "such a consideration would be a step towards constructing a single model hamiltonian where the same degrees of freedom are incorporated and which possesses two different limiting cases for low and high angular momenta .",
    "\\ii ) we note that further refinements of the considered approach are possible .",
    "for example , it is known that the experimentally observed parity shift in the light actinide nuclei decreases with the angular momentum almost exponentially @xcite .",
    "we see in figure 3(a ) that in the first few levels with @xmath114 the theoretical splitting does not decrease enough rapidly to fit this exponential behavior , while for @xmath115 the fast decrease is already reached .",
    "we notice that the behavior of the theoretical splitting for @xmath116 is due to the change of the potential shape from a parabola at @xmath117 to the double ",
    "well for @xmath118 , which affects most strongly the energy shift in @xmath119 and @xmath120 . as a result relatively large discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental energy values are observed at these angular momenta ( see table  1 ) , with the related @xmath121 ratios ( characteristics of collectivity ) being also affected .",
    "this problem can be fixed if the potential ( [ ubeta ] ) is modified so as to obtain a double  well shape at @xmath117",
    ". the modification can be achieved by applying in equation ( [ ubeta ] ) the term @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a constant .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that the behavior of the theoretical parity splitting and the respective values of the low energy levels can be better reproduced by means of the additional parameter @xmath124 .",
    "so we suggest that such efforts should be done in a further work after the electromagnetic transition probabilities being considered ( see below ) .",
    "\\iii ) the present formalism is capable of providing model predictions on @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 reduced transition probabilities between levels of alternating parity bands .",
    "their specific model behavior is related to the changing values of @xmath84 in the collective angular momentum states @xmath83 .",
    "our preliminary analysis indicates that specific staggering effects in the transition probabilities could be expected on this basis .",
    "on the other hand the presence of @xmath84- mixing amplitudes coming from the non - diagonal terms in the qorm hamiltonian would restrict such a staggering behavior .",
    "therefore , the involvement of electromagnetic transition probabilities in the study would make the model more sensitive to the presence of non - axial octupole deformations .",
    "in addition , the involvement of the `` intrinsic '' wave function determined in the solution of the schrdinger equation is of importance in the model analysis of electromagnetic transition probabilities .",
    "this study is the subject of further work .",
    "in conclusion , we propose a collective model formalism incorporating the characteristics of the soft ( oscillating ) octupole mode and the properties of the stable quadrupole ",
    "octupole shapes in nuclei .",
    "this formalism is capable to reproduce the entire structure of nuclear alternating parity bands .",
    "we showed that it provides a successful description of the octupole bands and their staggering structure in several light actinide nuclei .",
    "the complicated `` beat '' staggering patterns are explained as the result of the interplay between octupole shape oscillations in a spin - dependent double - well potential and rotations of the quadrupole ",
    "octupole shape .",
    "the model analysis clearly indicates the transition between these two collective modes .",
    "so , the implemented study suggests a specific dynamical mechanism for the evolution of quadrupole ",
    "octupole collectivity .",
    "the model predictions outline a possible way for development of collectivity in the higher angular momenta with a presence of further staggering regions .",
    "the considered dynamical mechanism can govern a wide range of properties of nuclei with complex shapes ."
