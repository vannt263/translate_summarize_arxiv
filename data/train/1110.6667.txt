    "there has long been an interest in the possibility of superconductivity with the paired electrons having an order parameter consisting of a triplet spin configuration and the corresponding odd orbital symmetry [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "the simplest odd orbital symmetry has the _ p_-wave form . in a crystal with a non - cubic structure",
    ", there can be a variety of different _",
    "p_-wave states [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] . depending upon the temperature _ t _ , magnetic field * _ h _ * , and pressure _ p _ , there can be phases corresponding to different triplet states [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "one of the easiest ways to characterize the _ p_-wave states is by measurements of the _ t _ dependence of the upper critical field @xmath0 [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "however , when multiple phases are present in the same crystal , as in upt@xmath1 , a proper analysis requires a variety of experimental results [ 6 , 7 ] .",
    "recently , a new class of ferromagnetic superconductors has been of great interest .",
    "presently this class consists of uge@xmath2[9 ] , uir [ 10 ] , urhge [ 11 ] , ucoge [ 12 ] , which except for uir have orthorhombic crystal structures . for urhge ,",
    "the superconductivity arises within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "that is also true for ucoge at ambient pressure , but when sufficient pressure is applied , the ferromagnetic phase disappears , leaving the superconducting phase without any obvious additional ferromagnetism [ 13 , 14 ] . in the cases of uge@xmath2 and uir",
    ", applying pressure within the ferromagnetic phase induces the superconductivity [ 9 , 10 ] .",
    "in addition , polarized neutron experiments have been interpreted as providing evidence for a field induced ferrimagnetic state in ucoge , with local moments of different magnitudes in opposite directions on the u and co sites [ 15 ] . for a ferromagnetic superconductor with orthorhombic symmetry ,",
    "the possible order parameter symmetries were given by mineev [ 16 ] .",
    "hardy and huxley measured @xmath3 of urhge at ambient pressure in all three crystal axis directions [ 17 ] . using only the slope at @xmath4 in each crystal direction as a fitting parameter",
    ", they found that the scharnberg - klemm theory fit their data quantitatively [ 17 ] , assuming the crystal - aligned polar state with completely broken symmetry ( cbs ) [ 2 ] .",
    "for this state , @xmath3 has a distinctly different @xmath5 dependence for @xmath6 , along the polar axis , than for @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , in the axial plane . by fitting only the slopes at @xmath9 in these three crystal axis directions , which eliminated the effective mass anisotropy for the closed orbits of the paired electrons in the three crystal directions , as in landau diamagnetism and in the de haas - van alphen effect",
    ", the results implied that the @xmath10-wave state @xmath11 for all applied field directions .",
    "this remarkable fit for the low field regime of the superconducting state in urhge did not require the inclusion of the ferromagnetism into the theory , as the only apparent effect of the magnetization was to give rise to a demagnetization jump in @xmath0 at the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath4 , beyond which the slopes of @xmath12 were fit .",
    "in addition , @xmath13 exceeded the pauli limit for all three crystal axis directions , providing compelling evidence for parallel - spin state cooper pairing .    upon the discovery of magnetic - field induced reentrant superconductivity in urhge [ 18 ]",
    ", much interest turned to the possible source of the high field superconducting phase .",
    "then , superconductivity was discovered in ucoge [ 12 ] , and @xmath12 was measured for all three crystal axis directions [ 19 ] , and all of the curves exhibited upward curvature [ 20 ] .",
    "subsequently , a highly anomalous _ s_-shaped @xmath12 curve was observed for @xmath14 with @xmath15 . since @xmath16 at low fields , this change in the @xmath17 direction only occurred in very pure , well aligned samples . this behavior may also have something to do with a reentrant phase , one that is close in field strength to the low - field phase [ 21,22 ] .",
    "the first attempts to describe upward curvature in @xmath12 in all three crystal directions were based either upon ferromagnetic fluctuations [ 23 ] , or upon a crossover from one parallel - spin state to another [ 24 ] .",
    "meanwhile , a mean - field theory of the complementary effects of itinerant ferromagnetism and parallel - spin superconductivity was developed [ 25 , 26 ] . to date",
    ", the field dependence of this mutual enhancement has not been investigated . here",
    ", we study the case in which the _ p_-wave pairing interaction strength is anisotropic , but finite in all crystal directions . since @xmath12 is essentially isotropic in the @xmath18 plane for samples of ucoge with medium purity [ 19 ] , we studied the partially broken symmetry ( pbs ) state as a function of the pairing interaction anisotropy .",
    "this can give rise to a kink in @xmath12 in at least one crystal axis direction [ 27 ] .",
    "our calculation of @xmath12 assumes weak coupling for a homogeneous clean type - ii material .",
    "@xmath0 is therefore found by solving the linearized gorkov gap equation [ 2 ]    @xmath19    in our present case the interaction is of _ p_-wave form @xmath20 which can be written in terms of the relevant spherical harmonics .",

    "we expand the order parameter in the harmonic oscillator states and the spherical harmonics @xmath25 and insert eq ( 4 ) into the gorkov gap equation .",
    "the details are presented in the appendix .",

    "this will be treated in a future calculation , along with the inclusion of the spontaneous and field - induced magnetization . however , as a first approximation , we shall neglect the effects of the magnetization , as in the case of urhge , in which the magnetization affects @xmath61 by introducing a sharp demagnetization effect near @xmath4 .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we plotted the reduced field @xmath62 versus the reduced temperature @xmath63 for the polar state and for a variety of pbss with @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "note that these pbs states all have an inherent upward curvature , but since @xmath66 , the polar state dominates near @xmath67 .",

    "_ we have not included the spontaneous or field - induced magnetization into our calculations at this point .",

    "the experimental data diverges from the theoretical values for larger fields .",
    "the inclusion of the spontaneous magnetization might alter the fit , but a more plausible explanation for this discrepancy is a field - dependent hopping term related to the effective electron mass . as is discussed in aoki _ et al .",
    "_ , this increase in effective mass may explain the _",
    "s_-shaped curvature of ucoge s upper critical field in the anomalous high field regime [ 21 ]",

    "2(b ) , the best fit to the data for @xmath77 , which shows a distinct field - induced crossover from the cbs to the pbs state .    using extremely clean single crystal samples , aoki _",
    "_ has shown that the field alignment affects the upward curvature in ucoge quite substantially , especially at high fields , which is likely due to the field - induced ferrimagnetic state .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to calculate the angle dependence of the slope of the upper critical field , at least close to @xmath4 .",
    "though the angle dependence of the polar state was analytically shown to be proportional to @xmath78^{-1/2}$ ] by scharnberg and klemm [ 2 ] , the angle dependence of the axial state has not yet been calculated analytically .",
    "this angle dependence may prove useful in identifying the @xmath10-wave superconducting state present in certain materials , and possibly suggest new experiments on the well known _",

    "we found that it is possible to fit the upward curvature of the @xmath12 data from medium - purity ucoge using a crossover from the polar / cbs state to a pbs state .",
    "however , without taking account of the spontaneous magnetization , the fitting parameter @xmath53 was different for the field in the @xmath79-axis direction than it was for the field in either the @xmath80 or @xmath81 directions . at the very least ,",
    "the spontaneous and field - dependent magnetization should be included in future fits , using an anisotropic itinerant ferromagnetic superconductor model similar to that previously studied .",

    "we note that the expression for the polar state separates from that for the two axial states , which comprise the pbs state for @xmath98 . in order to obtain the recursion relations for the pbs state , we begin by adding and subtracting both equations in eq .",
