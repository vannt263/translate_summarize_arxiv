    "in 1996 , heath - brown @xcite showed that for sufficiently large prime numbers @xmath0 , the heilbronn sum @xmath1 is bounded above by @xmath2 when @xmath3 is not divisible by @xmath0 , so that weyl s criterion implies the uniform distribution of the sequence @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 denotes an absolute constant ) .",
    "the novelty of his approach was to reduce the problem ( after an application of cauchy - schwarz and a suitable change of variables ) to counting the number of solutions to a polynomial congruence modulo @xmath0 and then to achieve a non - trivial count by a modification of stepanov s method appearing in the proof of the riemann hypothesis for a curve over a finite field @xcite . coincidentally , in 1992 , mitkin @xcite had considered just this counting question for two polynomials ( one of which happened to be the one used in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , he used the same methods and obtained the same bound of @xcite .",
    "our focus is to consider generalisations of this counting problem .    for a prime number @xmath6 , we consider polynomials @xmath7 having rational coefficients with denominators coprime to @xmath0 and with degree @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the number of solutions to the congruence @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in bounds for @xmath9 with @xmath0 sufficiently large when the degree @xmath8 has size proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that in this generality one can not say better than the trivial bound @xmath11 . indeed",
    "if @xmath12 , then @xmath13 and moreover for any @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "a much deeper example can be found in the theory of elliptic curves .",
    "consider the legendre elliptic curve over @xmath16 for @xmath17 , given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 with @xmath21 , be the hasse - deuring invariant .",
    "finally let @xmath22 where @xmath23 counts the number of @xmath16-rational points on the curve .",
    "then it is known ( igusa @xcite , dwork @xcite ) that @xmath24 .",
    "it therefore follows that the number of solutions to the polynomial congruence @xmath25 , for any fixed a is essentially the same as the number of isomorphism classes of such elliptic curves satisfying the condition @xmath26 .",
    "the hasse estimates imply that there are no solutions if @xmath27 . on the other hand , if @xmath28 , deuring showed that the number of such classes is essentially the kronecker class number @xmath29 of an imaginary quadratic field .",
    "it can then be shown that for @xmath30 , ( see for example @xcite for details ) @xmath31 there is also a lower bound of the form @xmath32 for @xmath33 with a bounded number of possible exceptions .",
    "returning to methods from transcendence theory , mitkin @xcite and heath - brown @xcite constructed two polynomials @xmath34 with @xmath35 such that for all @xmath36 the corresponding @xmath37 is bounded above by @xmath38 with estimates uniform in @xmath3 .",
    "the polynomial considered by both authors was the truncated logarithm @xmath39 the truncated logarithm is not special in this regard and mitkin established the same asymptotic bound for the truncated exponential @xmath40 for the proof , one constructs an auxiliary polynomial @xmath41 ( not vanishing identically ) in several variables with relatively low degree in each variable , but with a high order of vanishing at each root of @xmath7 in the prime field .",
    "then , @xmath9 is bounded by the degree of @xmath41 divided by the order of vanishing .    to create @xmath41 with high order of vanishing at the selected points , leibniz rule",
    "is used so that the higher derivatives of @xmath41 are forced to vanish at most of the roots of the original polynomial . in the case of the truncated logarithm and exponential ,",
    "this is achieved using the fact that each satisfies a differential equation of the form @xmath42 for each @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote polynomials , of low degree relative to @xmath47 , with integer coefficients ( for the moment , we will be intentionally imprecise about what is meant by  low degree \" ) .",
    "then since @xmath48 is constant at our points of interest ( and obviously as is @xmath49 ) , the values taken by these ( weighted ) higher derivatives of @xmath48 are those taken by certain polynomials of low degree .",
    "it is then not difficult to determine that construction of @xmath41 amounts to finding a nontrivial solution to a system of linear equations .",
    "after this construction , one has to verify that when the variables in @xmath41 are specialised for the problem under consideration , the resulting new polynomial , which is now of one variable , does not vanish identically ( see section 2 for some details ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath50 is obtained by truncating a @xmath51-function , while @xmath52 is a truncation of an @xmath52-function ( both types of functions were introduced by siegel @xcite ; see the notes by beukers @xcite for recent results ) .",
    "also the hasse invariant @xmath53 above is a truncation of the hypergeometric function @xmath54 .",
    "it is then a natural question to ask if perhaps there is a much larger class of such polynomials @xmath34 for which there is a non - trivial estimate for @xmath9 . to this end",
    ", one could consider either @xmath52- or @xmath51-functions with rational taylor coefficients but it is not clear how one should truncate these in a natural way .",
    "we illustrate this with the following example : let @xmath55 and let @xmath56 be the polynomial obtained by truncating @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "this polynomial satisfies a differential equation similar to and we can show that @xmath59 ( we omit the details ) . now consider instead the series @xmath60 the polynomial associated with it should still be naturally truncated at @xmath61 ( determined by the vanishing of the denominators of the coefficients ) but now the highest power of @xmath62 is too small so that we lack a formula of the type involving @xmath63 .",
    "our purpose in this note is extending the class of polynomials with high degree that have @xmath64 roots as @xmath0 grows without bound , but which are obtained by truncating suitable functions that satisfy a higher order differential equation .",
    "we observe that the methods of @xcite and @xcite can be modified to accomplish this for truncations of polylogarithms and polyexponentials , for which we obtain an upper bound much weaker than a power saving in @xmath0 .",
    "in general , the difficulty is twofold : the higher order derivatives depend on lower order derivatives ( which are obviously non - constant at the roots of the polynomial ) and the non - vanishing property requires , in essence , an algebraic independence involving the polynomial and its derivatives .",
    "our result , when applied to truncations of polylogarithms , may be stated as follows :    let @xmath65 , and let @xmath66 denote the truncated polylogarithm @xmath67 then for @xmath68 @xmath69    our analogous result for polyexponentials is similar :    let @xmath70 , and let @xmath71 denote the truncated polyexponential @xmath72 then for @xmath73 @xmath74    the weakness in the results above are primarily due to the fact that we use an inductive method for @xmath66 and @xmath71 . in employing a modification of the methods in @xcite and @xcite , we are unable to control sufficiently the degrees of some polynomials that appear as coefficients involving @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively so that some of the degrees grow exponentially .    finally , we consider the analogous question for the bessel function @xmath77 for which we are able to save a power of @xmath0 .",
    "here we were unable to adapt the methods used above involving algebraic independence and so appeal to siegel s original argument @xcite showing the algebraic independence of @xmath78 and @xmath79 over the complex numbers .",
    "the argument can be applied with suitable modifications provided that the degree of the auxiliary polynomial in each variable is sufficiently small relative to @xmath0 ; this is a consequence of tame ramification , i.e. , the ramification index at a point is relatively prime to @xmath0 , which allows expansion of algebraic elements as a puiseux series .",
    "this technique is not possible in general , as noted by chevalley @xcite , as puiseux series do not account for artin - schreier extensions .    for the truncation of the bessel function ,",
    "we assume that @xmath6 and let @xmath80 our result for the truncated bessel function may then be stated as follows :    for the bessel function @xmath81 , one has @xmath82 .",
    "the proof of theorem 3 works equally well for the truncation of bessel functions of higher order @xmath83 provided that @xmath84 is small relative to @xmath0 .    0.2 in * acknowledgments . *",

    "this would guarantee that @xmath92 and thus yield a bound on @xmath93 . by differentiating @xmath94 with use of and observing that all terms of the form @xmath95 may be discarded , one finds that it is enough to require @xmath96 to guarantee the vanishing of @xmath94 at the zeros of @xmath85 while maintaining that @xmath97 not vanish identically .",
    "the left - hand side of simply reflects that we are arranging @xmath98 to vanish for @xmath99 at the roots of @xmath85 : the multiplier @xmath91 occurs because @xmath100 yields @xmath91 polynomials with coefficients that are linear forms in the coefficients of @xmath41 , and the term @xmath101 represents a bound on the degree of the polynomials appearing in each higher derivative of @xmath94 , which was obtained by use of . on the right - hand side , the term @xmath102 is a consequence of the number of coefficients appearing in @xmath41 .    the second part of the argument is deeper and reflects the transcendental nature of the power series giving rise to the polynomial .",
    "one has to show that @xmath94 itself is not identically zero , and the arguments in @xcite and @xcite are essentially the same on this , using the observation that @xmath94 will not vanish identically if it does not also vanish modulo @xmath103 .",
    "this has the effect of putting restrictions on the parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath5 above , namely that they can not be chosen too small . writing @xmath106 it is enough to show that the smallest @xmath107 in this sum for which @xmath108 is nonzero satisfies @xmath109 .",
    "this is lemma 3 in @xcite , and is established using leibniz rule , the binomial theorem , and an inductive argument .",

    "this will motivate our definition of the auxiliary polynomial .",
    "let @xmath142 be nonnegative integers .",
    "the derivative @xmath143 if not identically zero , is equal to a sum of polynomials of the form @xmath144 modulo @xmath95 with integer coefficients , where @xmath145 @xmath146 and @xmath147 are polynomials where @xmath148 and @xmath149    in the proof of theorem 1 , we will need to use the fact that the auxiliary polynomial we define does not vanish identically , and this is precisely why the sum @xmath150 appears . in the case of @xmath151 , this is unimportant , as powers of @xmath152 simply decrease . for general @xmath115 ,",
    "the same is not necessarily true : as in lemma 1 , powers of @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) are exchanged for powers of @xmath155 .",

    "let @xmath367 be a solution to the equation @xmath368 as @xmath369 , it follows that the extension @xmath370 is tamely ramified .",
    "thus ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath371 admits an expression at @xmath372 of the form @xmath373 with @xmath374 rational exponents .",
    "therefore the expression @xmath375 is a well - defined puiseux series .",
    "furthermore with @xmath376 the roots of @xmath377 , we have @xmath378 from which we conclude that for some @xmath379 , @xmath380 it follows from that @xmath381 as @xmath365 and the ramification index of any point is bounded by the degree of the extension , it follows that the degree of @xmath371 at any point , whether as a pole or zero , can not be greater than @xmath382 .",
    "thus we may write an expression for @xmath371 at a branch of infinity as @xmath383 with @xmath384 rational exponents , @xmath385 , and @xmath386 . as @xmath387 ,",
    "application of yields that @xmath388 , a contradiction .",
    "the first step proceeds as in the proofs of theorems 1 and 2 , with the construction of an auxiliary polynomial , which in this case is a function of four variables . with @xmath366",
    ", we set @xmath389 where in this case we require that the total degree of @xmath41 as a function of its third and fourth variables be at most @xmath5 . as the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the inequality @xmath390 is simply @xmath391 ,",
    "we obtain a now familiar bound : @xmath392    for the second step of the proof , we suppose that there exists a nonzero polynomial @xmath393 with coefficients in @xmath394 $ ] of degree at most @xmath395 and total degree in @xmath396 and @xmath397 at most @xmath398 that satisfies @xmath399 also , let @xmath400 by the differential equation for @xmath401 , we have by that @xmath402 from which it follows that @xmath403 let @xmath404 denote the resultant of @xmath405 and @xmath406 as polynomials in the second variable . by and",
    ", we have for suitable polynomials @xmath407 and @xmath408 ( in @xmath397 and the coefficients of @xmath405 and @xmath406 ) that @xmath409 the resultant @xmath404 is a polynomial in @xmath401 with coefficients in @xmath394 $ ] ; as the total degree of each of @xmath405 and @xmath406 is at most @xmath398 , it follows by definition of the resultant that @xmath410 similarly , the degree in @xmath62 of each coefficient in @xmath404 is bounded from above by @xmath411 .",
    "therefore if @xmath47 is chosen with @xmath412 and @xmath387 , the conditions of lemma 7 will be satisfied .",

    "suppose without loss of generality that @xmath421 . by setting the coefficient of @xmath417 in @xmath183 equal to zero ,",
    "we again obtain , as the degree @xmath395 of @xmath393 in @xmath62 satisfies @xmath422 , and thus the term @xmath417 did not contribute to any nonzero term in @xmath393",

    "as the elements of @xmath425 of a particular total degree in @xmath396 and @xmath397 derive from precisely those of the same total degree in @xmath424 , it follows that @xmath429 has zero total degree in @xmath396 and @xmath397 , and that @xmath430 is an element of the rational function field @xmath428 .",
