    "the ideas behind the construction of solitons and instantons can be to a certain extent extended to noncommutative geometries , at least to some of them . within",
    "the present context the word soliton refers to a finite - energy smooth solution with no reference to conserved quantities ; an instanton is a smooth finite - action solution with euclidean signature , generally involving yang - mills fields whose field equations reduce to self - duality conditions . in ordinary geometry",
    "they are both stable because of a topological obstruction to their decay . to a certain extent topology",
    "now becomes ill - defined and propagators regular .",
    "soliton solutions thus loose somewhat their specificity .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to study their structure on a fuzzy space .",
    "it was sometime after dirac presented his magnetic monopole  @xcite solution that it was shown  @xcite to be a singular limit of a soliton solution .",
    "since the monopole charge is the first chern number of a line bundle over the 2-sphere , to obtain a regular solution this bundle has to be combined with another of equal and opposite monopole charge .",
    "the gauge group has to be enlarged to @xmath4 and a higgs field added so that the topological twist can be encoded as the winding number of a map of the sphere at infinity in configuration space into the unit sphere of the @xmath4 lie algebra .",
    "the integer in turn can be identified as an element of the second homotopy of the homogeneous space @xmath5 .",
    "we recall this history because the monopole suggests one path from simple electromagnetism to the yang - mills - higgs - kibble action with an @xmath4 gauge group and a higgs field with values in the adjoint representation .    another way  @xcite is the study of electromagnetism on a noncommutative kaluza - klein - type extension of space - time with  @xcite the matrix algebra @xmath6 as additional internal structure .",
    "if we consider maxwell theory on this algebra then the extra matrix factor transforms the maxwell potential into a @xmath7-gauge multiplet and a triplet of higgs scalars .",
    "the t  hooft - polyakov solution can be considered then as a ` maxwell ' solution on the extended algebra @xmath8 and in this sense one can say that with the extra noncommutative factor the core region of the dirac monopole has been regularized . to define a smooth structure",
    "we must introduce a calculus or algebra of forms , a graded differential algebra @xmath9 over @xmath8 .    the theory which we call maxwell s on space - time can acquire quite a different aspect when applied  @xcite to more exotic spaces .",
    "we have just seen that the inclusion of a simple matrix factor in the algebra can radically change the singularity structure of the original theory .",
    "there are further examples of this , all of which are constructed by a procedure which resembles the blowing up of singularities in algebraic geometry except that in the present case a singular point is regularized not by expanding it into a higher dimensional variety but rather by surrounding it with a finite ` fuzzy ' structure .",
    "an enlightening comparison is with the description  @xcite of the core regions of planar nematic liquid crystals .",
    "the order - parameter of such a region can ` escape into the third dimension ' thereby resolving itself into a smooth configuration or it can remain , ill - defined , in the plane .    by definition the local ` electromagnetic ' gauge group of a geometry with structure algebra @xmath8",
    "is the set of unitary elements of the algebra . if @xmath10 then this yields @xmath11 as ` local ' gauge group .",
    "a simple example is afforded by the quantum approximations to a classical spin for large quantum numbers .",
    "if @xmath12 is the spin then the spin operators lie in @xmath13 with @xmath14 . in a way which can be made precise",
    "the algebra @xmath13 tends to the algebra of smooth functions on the sphere and the group @xmath11 tends to the group @xmath15 of local @xmath16 transformations .",
    "we shall refer to a manifold possessing a filtering of its calculus by a sequence of differential algebras over algebras of matrices as being fuzzy . as a fuzzy version of the space @xmath17 in which a monopole lives one can choose the simplest : the direct sum of all matrix algebras .    in section  2 we shall very briefly compare electromagnetism on ordinary flat @xmath17 with the same theory on the slightly more structured ` space ' which is a kaluza - klein extension  @xcite thereof by the algebra @xmath6 of @xmath18 matrices over the complex numbers .",
    "although it is necessary to introduce the complex numbers to describe it , the geometry of this latter ` 2-point ' space is real .",
    "we examine also the analogous case of a time - dependent fuzzy - sphere  @xcite .",
    "the ` abelian ' gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere has several ground states which have been called  @xcite ` instantons ' but which in the present context should rather be dubbed ` solitons ' . in section",
    "3 we find instanton - like solutions which tunnel between two of these solitons .",
    "the formalism of the following section could be said to describe ` fuzzy ' spherical @xmath19-branes  @xcite , in which case the instanton would be said to tunnel between two such configurations , one in which the branes coincide and the other in which they are completely separated . in the spherical case the separation is quantized and the instanton can have a topological interpretation .",
    "an summary of some results on projectors used is given in the appendix .",
    "we stress here the role of instantons as mediators between different stable vacuum sectors of a matrix geometry .",
    "several other aspects of instantons have also been carried over  @xcite into various noncommutative geometries including the fuzzy sphere  @xcite .",
    "similar calculations have been carried out  @xcite on the torus .",
    "in this section we recall very briefly some formulae which will be useful in studying product structures .",
    "let @xmath20 be smoothly embedded in @xmath17 .",
    "a dirac monipole will refer to a principle @xmath16 bundle over @xmath21 or to an associated complex line bundle @xmath22 over @xmath23 or to an extension of the former to a @xmath16 bundle over @xmath17 , either of which can be completely classified by a single integer @xmath24 .",
    "expressed algebraically a dirac monopole is an irreducible module over the algebra @xmath25 ; a t  hooft - polyakov monopole or soliton is exactly the same object over the algebra @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , if one consider ` maxwell s ' theory on the two algebras and look for a solution which tends in the asymptotic region to the monopole , then if @xmath27 one obtains the dirac monopole and if @xmath28 the t  hooft - polyakov soliton .",
    "this is an obvious remark which follows directly from the definition of a differential calculus over a product structure which is given in the appendix .",
    "it is perhaps the simplest example of the regularizing capabilities of noncommutative extensions of manifolds with singularities .",
    "there are many noncommutative versions of @xmath17 , all of which necessarily break the inhomogeneous invariance group @xmath29 of @xmath17 .",
    "we mention in particular the @xmath30-deformed version of faddeev  @xcite which has an interesting quantum group as invariance ` group ' .",
    "otherwise one can for example split the space into the product @xmath31 of the complex line times the real line  @xcite , a procedure which respects the subgroup @xmath32 .",
    "we shall choose to split space into the product @xmath33 which respects the subgroup @xmath34 .",
    "although we consider here exclusively the case of the canonical flat @xmath35 the same reasoning will apply to a curved manifold provided the soliton in question is of dimension @xmath36 and placed in a region of typical gaussian curvature @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",

    "if we introduce a length scale @xmath42 then the possible values of @xmath36 are given , for large @xmath43 , by the sequence of solutions to the equation @xmath44 this is to be interpreted as meaning that the ` 2-sphere ' of radius @xmath36 describes a ` space ' consisting of @xmath43 cells of area @xmath45 .",
    "the interpretation is taken from quantum mechanics .",
    "it parallels also that of a spin or of the landau - orbit structure of an electron gas in a constant normal magnetic field .",

    "the modes around the classical vacua , the ` momentum ' modes , interact with a gas of tunneling modes , the instantons ; otherwise the gas is free .",
    "the hopf fibration has chern number @xmath213 and for @xmath43 large the fuzzy sphere is a good approximation .",
    "one can say then that the instanton tunnels between a good and very bad approximation to the sphere but not between two distinct topological sectors .",
    "if one take the time variable together with the circle of the fibration then by compactifying one obtains a second sphere .",
    "the space becomes the euclidean schwarzschild solution , whose instanton number is the product  @xcite of an electric monopole charge and a magnetic monopole charge equal to @xmath53 .",
    "the electric charge must be identified as a topological invariant of the matrix factor .",
    "this is _ strictu sensu _ neither possible nor desirable .",
    "but the infinite potential barrier associated with a topological obstruction can be replaced by a very large barrier which would tend to infinity with the integer @xmath43 .",
    "we imagine the action of the partition @xmath169 $ ] as a quantum of energy for a state of the bosonic fock space described above and that the action of the element of the instanton which tunnels to the classical manifold appears as the associated free energy . we refrained from speculating about possible relations between the limit of the tunneling modes and winding modes .",
    "one of the authors ( j.m . ) would like to thank l.  dabrowski for his hospitality at s.i.s.s.a . where this work initiated and b.  schmidt for his hospitality an the a.  einstein institut , golm where it terminated .",
    "he also thanks p.  tod and d.  robinson for enlightening comments .",
    "h.s . would like to thank j.  pawelczyk for discussions on chern - simons terms .",
    "all benefited from discussion from g.  landi .",
    "if we consider a manifold @xmath79 of dimension @xmath62 as a subset of some higher - dimensional euclidean space @xmath214 then the algebra of functions @xmath215 can be defined as a formal algebra in terms of generators and relations .",
    "the coordinates @xmath216 of @xmath214 are the generators of an algebra @xmath217 which satisfy only the commutation relations @xmath218= 0 $ ] . within @xmath217",
    "there is an ideal defined by constraint relations @xmath219 which define @xmath79 as a submanifold .",
    "if @xmath217 is noncommutative then we suppose it to be still characterized by commutation relations but we shall no longer suppose that the constraint relations necessarily generate a non - trivial 2-sided ideal",
    ". the projection of @xmath217 onto @xmath8 which describes the embedding in the commutative limit will be a vector space map which to a certain approximation only can be considered an algebra epimorphism .",
    "if one introduce the moving frame @xmath220 on @xmath214 then the latter acquires the structure of a flat differential manifold .",
    "this defines by the embedding , that is , by the relations , a moving frame @xmath221 on @xmath79 and a splitting of the module of sections @xmath222 of @xmath223 into a direct sum @xmath224 of the module of 1-forms and a complement .",
    "the metric and the frame on @xmath79 are determined by the embedding relations .",
    "the construction is most elegantly described in terms of projectors .",
    "similar constructions on ordinary and graded spheres have been reviewed in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "the noncommutative generalization seems to be folklore .",
    "there are two cases of particular interest .",
    "the simplest case is when all the constraints could be referred to as commutation relations in the sense that they all vanish in the commutative limit .",
    "the dimension of @xmath79 is equal to @xmath43 and the projection of @xmath222 onto @xmath225 is an invertible element of @xmath226 , a projector of maximal rank .",
    "let @xmath227 be a basis of @xmath228 .",
    "then @xmath57 is defined by a projector @xmath229 of rank @xmath43 with @xmath230 a set of generators of @xmath57 . the projection @xmath231 has an extension to all of @xmath9 and we can identify @xmath111 as a left inverse of @xmath231 .",
    "we shall suppose that there exist @xmath43 matrices @xmath232 which satisfy the relations @xmath233 this is a slight generalization of a proposal by pusz and woronowicz@xcite .",
    "the @xmath234 determines  @xcite the structure of the algebra of forms .",
    "the algebra generated by the @xmath235 is the generalized clifford algebra and it bears the same relation to the exterior algebra as its classical counterpart .",
    "the correspondence between the clifford and exterior algebras is only transparent at the level of 1-forms .",
    "it is given by the module map generated by @xmath236 .",
    "the extension to the entire clifford algebra is given , for example , by the map @xmath237 and consists in dropping the ` symmetric ' part .",
    "for this to be well defined the @xmath234 would have to satisfy the braid equation .    to every element @xmath238 we associate an element @xmath111 defined as @xmath239",
    "then @xmath111 is hermitian if and only if @xmath240 is hermitian and @xmath111 is an idempotent if and only if @xmath240 is an involution .",
    "in particular we consider @xmath241 the product here is a tensor product and @xmath242 .",
    "the @xmath240 will be hermitian if @xmath243 the differential calculus is real if and only if the @xmath68 are antihermitian . using  ( [ clif ] ) we can write the square of @xmath240 as @xmath244 it is an involution if the conditions @xmath245 are satisfied . this is the case  @xcite for the sequence of algebras @xmath246 for example . in these cases",
    "the condition on the norm of @xmath247 is automatically satisfied and so @xmath111 is a projector if and only if the commutation relations are satisfied .",
    "this can be stated as the proposition that the element @xmath248 defined in ( [ e - i ] ) is an hermitian idempotent if and only if all the relations which define @xmath246 are satisfied .",
    "one notes that in these examples the ` holonomic ' basis does not commute with the algebra but the basis @xmath58 does .",
    "sone could more properly state that the holonomic basis @xmath67-commutes and the basis @xmath58 does not @xmath67-commute . in the commutative limit",
    "@xmath111 tends to the identity , the unit element that is of the @xmath249 group . from  ( [ defdiff ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath250 = - \\frac 12 [ \\imath , f ] = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho^{-1 } \\gamma^a e_a f.\\ ] ] this formula is to be compared with the formula  ( [ extra ] ) for the differential .",
    "the @xmath251-matrices are so defined that @xmath252 one concludes then that @xmath253 and that one can choose the normalization so that @xmath254    the paradigms are the ` quantum ' deformation @xmath246 of euclidean space introduced  @xcite by faddeev the center is generated by a single element @xmath36 which one can think of as a radius .",
    "the quotient @xmath255 of @xmath246 by the ideal generated by the central element is known as a quantum sphere .",
    "an element of @xmath256 has been found  @xcite which is an hermitian idempotent if and only if all the relations which define @xmath257 are satisfied .",
