    "this paper is the first in a series dealing with a comparison of the optical and radio properties of a sample of 3cr radio galaxies with @xmath0 .",
    "the sample was taken from the revised 3c catalog of radio sources of smith , spinrad & smith ( 1976 ) as updated by @xcite and @xcite . in total , there are 66 objects in the sample and good quality radio maps showing the large - scale radio structure were found in the literature for 51 of these objects .",
    "we observed the remaining 15 objects with the vla . in future papers ,",
    "results of the radio - optical comparison will be presented . here",
    "we discuss the new vla images that were obtained .",
    "listed in table [ sample ] are the observed sources along with their optical positions , redshifts , 178 mhz flux densities on the scale of @xcite , and spectral indices between 178 and 750 mhz .",
    "( the spectral index @xmath1 is defined throughout in the sense @xmath2 . ) the optical positions and redshifts are taken from @xcite .",
    "the 178 mhz flux densities are from kellermann , pauliny - toth & williams ( 1969 ) except for 3c268.2 and 3c306.1 which are taken from @xcite and gower , scott & wills ( 1967 ) ( both taken from @xcite ) , respectively , because their values in @xcite are likely contaminated with confusing flux .",
    "all fluxes were adjusted to the scale of @xcite using the corrections given in @xcite .",
    "the spectral indices are also consistent with the scale of @xcite .",
    "they were taken from laing , riley & longair ( 1983 ) if available ( 3c16 , 3c220.1 , 3c401 ) , or computed using the 178 mhz flux densities given here and 750 mhz flux densities from @xcite adjusted to the scale of @xcite using the corrections given in @xcite .",
    "also included in table [ sample ] are the rest frame luminosity at 178 mhz , the scale , the largest angular size ( measured from the best available maps ) , and the linear size of the source . a friedmann cosmology with h@xmath3 = 50 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath3 = 0 was used in the calculation of these quantities and is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "table [ radio - opt ] contains the position of the radio core for each source , the frequency of the map used to determine the core position , the reference for the core position , other radio map references , the optical spectral type of the object ( i.e. the `` optical class '' ) and the reference for this type . the optical type was taken directly from @xcite who use slightly different notation than that used here .",
    "their `` quasar / weak quasar '' ( q / wq ) classification is equivalent to our broad - line ( b ) type .",
    "similarly , their `` high - excitation galaxy '' ( heg ) corresponds to our narrow line ( n ) type and their `` low - excitation galaxy '' ( leg ) is our low - excitation ( e ) type .",
    "the references for the optical spectra on which these classifications are based can be found in @xcite .",
    "references giving additional spectral information that are not found in @xcite are included in the optical reference column .",
    "the data presented in this paper are from six separate sets of observations which are summarized in table [ obs ] .",
    "most observations were made at l - band in order to map the steep - spectrum extended structure of the sources .",
    "the c- and x - band observations aid in the detection and study of the flatter spectrum cores , jets and hot spots .",
    "all observations were made at two observing frequencies which were later averaged to give a map at a single effective frequency . at l - band these were 1.365 and 1.435 ghz , at c - band these were 4.835 and 4.885 ghz , and at x - band they were 8.415 and 8.465 ghz .",
    "a bandwidth of 50 mhz was used for all observations .",
    "all data were reduced using the aips software package in the standard manner . 3c48 and",
    "3c286 were used as primary flux and polarization position angle calibrators .",
    "bad scans were removed from the calibrator data until acceptable amplitude and phase solutions were obtained using nearby point sources as phase calibrators .",
    "these solutions were then applied to the program sources . for the l - band data , a small first - order correction for ionospheric faraday rotation ( corresponding to at most a few degrees at the frequencies used )",
    "was applied using the aips task farad .",
    "this correction was based on mean monthly sunspot data as ionospheric measurements were not available .",
    "finally , a series of self - calibrations was performed to further improve the maps .",
    "typically we applied 2 to 3 phase - only self - calibrations followed by 1 to 2 phase and amplitude self - calibrations .",
    "the self - calibration procedure was stopped when no significant improvement in the map was seen .",
    "most maps were made using the aips task imagr , with robustness between zero and one ( intermediate between uniform and natural weighting ) to improve the noise properties of the maps . for a very few sources",
    "the flux difference between the two observing frequencies contributed significantly to the off - source noise at 1.4-ghz ; in these cases the two frequencies were mapped separately , a spectral index was determined , and the visibility amplitudes were corrected to the average frequency with imagr before mapping .",
    "the 4.86-ghz map of 3c357 was made with aips task apcln .",
    "the 4.86-ghz map of 3c456 was made with aips task mx .",
    "both 4.86-ghz maps were provided courtesy of j.  stocke .",
    "polarization maps as well as total intensity maps are presented for most sources .",
    "however , we have no polarization information for the objects observed at 1.4-ghz in the a - configuration or for the 4.86-ghz observations because no suitable polarization calibration data were available .",
    "polarization vectors are only plotted where both the total and polarized intensities exceed three times the appropriate r.m.s .",
    "the lengths of the vectors on the polarization maps indicate the degree of polarization ; their directions indicate the directions of the electric field .",
    "if the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) along the line of sight is sufficiently low , lines perpendicular to these vectors would be parallel to the emission - weighted mean projected direction of the magnetic field vector in the radio source .",
    "the integrated rotation measures towards these sources , where known , are low ( simard - normandin , kronberg & button 1981 ) ; however , the rotation measures towards particular regions of the sources are not known , and so the vector directions must be interpreted with caution .    for two sources , maps of spectral index between 1.4 and 8.44-ghz are presented .",
    "these were made with matching longest and shortest baselines , and appropriate weighting , to minimize systematic errors induced by different _",
    "uv _ coverages .",
    "only regions where the signal exceeded three times the r.m.s .",
    "noise on both maps are plotted .",
    "information concerning the maps presented here is summarized in table [ maps ] .",
    "the dynamic ranges listed in the second to last column are defined as the peak map flux divided by the r.m.s .",
    "noise in the map ; the noise approaches the expected thermal value in many cases in total - intensity maps and in almost all maps in stokes q and u. the beam size in the last column is the fwhm along the major and minor axes of the restoring elliptical gaussian , obtained by fitting to the dirty beam .",
    "this beam is shown in one of the corners of each map .",
    "the contour levels and the location of the peak flux are given in the figure captions .",
    "since 3c348 was observed at two different epochs , a check on the systematic difference of the 1.4-ghz polarization maps is possible .",
    "a comparison of the position angles of the polarization maps made at these two different epochs shows the systematic difference ( reflecting systematics in , among other things , the polarization angle calibration and the correction for ionospheric faraday rotation ) to be @xmath5 1@xmath6 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "is of the order of a few degrees , which is about what we expect .",
    "thus the polarization calibration appears to have worked well .",
    "total fluxes are given in column 4 of table [ fluxes ] .",
    "in general , the error in the total flux is @xmath7 5% .",
    "this includes both the calibration error and the on - source error .",
    "column 3 of table [ fluxes ] lists the ratio of the largest angular size of the source to the largest scale structure visible to the vla configuration and frequency with which the source was observed .",
    "if this ratio is @xmath8 1 then the source may be undersampled ; that is , large scale structure ( i.e. structure with angular size @xmath8 @xmath9 ) will be missing from the map and the total flux presented in table [ fluxes ] will be lower than the true value .",
    "fluxes from individual structures smaller than @xmath9 , such as point sources , are not affected by this undersampling .",
    "a ratio @xmath10 1 does not necessarily mean that the source is undersampled , however .",
    "for example , a source could be composed of several components that are all visible to the array but the combined angular size of all these components is larger than the largest scale structure visible to the array . in this case , no structure or flux would be missing from the map . for this work ,",
    "the severity of the undersampling is determined by comparing the total fluxes from our maps with single - dish total fluxes from the literature ( listed in column 7 ) and with fully sampled maps at the same frequency , if available .",
    "total fluxes in table [ fluxes ] marked with a dagger indicate probable undersampling and are discussed in the comments on individual sources . either these fluxes are too low to agree ( within the errors ) with the values in the literature or , in the case of the 8.44-ghz fluxes , las/@xmath9 @xmath10 1 and no reliable comparison fluxes are available .",
    "single - dish fluxes from the literature are presented in column 7 .",
    "if published values agreed , an average value with an appropriate error is listed .",
    "( if no error was given in the literature , a value of 5% was assumed . )",
    "if published values were not in agreement , a range of values is listed .",
    "this disagreement may be an indication of source variability .",
    "@xcite provided an 8.4-ghz comparison flux for 3c63 although no error was given .",
    "other 8.4-ghz comparison fluxes were estimated using @xmath11 and @xmath125-ghz fluxes .",
    "the @xmath11 values used were those of @xcite adjusted to the flux scale of @xcite using the corrections given in @xcite .",
    "core flux densities or upper limits are given in column 5 of table [ fluxes ] .",
    "these flux values were determined by one of four methods . if the core was visible and relatively isolated , a point source with characteristics matching those of the beam given in table [ maps ] was fit to the core using the aips task imfit . the integrated flux from this point - source fit is taken to be the core flux .",
    "if the core was visible but surrounded by confusing flux , a two - component fit using a point source and an additional sloping background was performed and the integrated flux from the point - source fit is quoted in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "if the core was not visible , the lobes of the source were removed by subtracting gaussian fits , again using imfit .",
    "if the core then became apparent at the appropriate position ( a previously identified radio core position or the optical position if no core position was available ) , imfit was used to fit a gaussian point source to it as above .",
    "core fluxes obtained in this manner are marked with an asterisk and an estimate of the uncertainty of these core fluxes is given below . if the core still was not visible , a value of 3 @xmath13 the on - source r.m.s .",
    "is listed as an upper limit for the core flux .",
    "the error for the core flux given in column 6 of table [ fluxes ] is the value returned by imfit .",
    "this is the flux error due to the uncertainty of the fit only and does not include the @xmath14% calibration and on - source error . for most cases ,",
    "the error returned by imfit is much larger than 5% and so this additional error may be neglected .",
    "however , when the error from imfit is @xmath5 10% of the core flux ( 3c63 , 3c277 , 3c287.1 , 3c357 and 3c456 ) , the additional 5% error should be included to obtain a more realistic value .    to estimate the uncertainty of core fluxes measured from lobe - subtracted maps , the procedure was performed on a 4.86-ghz b - configuration map of 3c456 from @xcite .",
    "( this map is not presented in this paper because the structure is nearly identical to that in the 1.4-ghz map presented here . ) when compared to the core flux from the a - configuration map of the same frequency given in table [ fluxes ] , the core flux obtained from the lobe - subtracted map was low by 30% .",
    "this gives a rough estimate of the uncertainty of the fluxes determined by this method and indicates that the error returned by imfit may be a substantial underestimate of the true error in these cases .",
    "however , this source is more complicated and required the removal of 3 components ( see discussion in section [ 456 ] ) rather than 2 components like the other sources ( 3c320 , 3c434 and 3c459 ) and so this uncertainty may be an overestimate for these other sources .",
    "the position of the core obtained from the lobe - subtracted map was only 0.22@xmath15 different from that obtained from the point source fit to the a - configuration map .",
    "this indicates that the structure remaining after the lobes were subtracted was indeed the core .",
    "radio core positions , taken either from our maps or from the literature , are given in table [ radio - opt ] .",
    "those marked with an asterisk denote probable cores detected only after the removal of the radio lobes .",
    "no radio core position is given for 3c16 since no core detection is known .",
    "core positions taken from maps presented in this paper typically have errors of 0.35@xmath15 in each direction .",
    "an examination of the optical positions in table [ sample ] shows that they are within 1@xmath15 of the radio core positions for most sources . since errors in the optical position are assumed to be a minimum of 1@xmath15 in each direction , positions within 1@xmath15 of each other are in agreement .",
    "differences between radio core and optical positions that are @xmath10 1@xmath15 are discussed in the comments on individual sources .",
    "comparisons of different radio core positions for the same source ( i.e. core positions at different frequencies , core positions from different fits , core positions from the literature ) are also discussed .",
    "1 ) . this source may be undersampled , though the total 8-ghz flux density is consistent with values predicted from the spectral index and 5-ghz fluxes .",
    "no point - like core is detected in our 8.44-ghz map and no core detections were found in the literature .",
    "two extended knots of emission bracket the position of the optical identification , which lies on the ne edge of the southern knot . due to the proximity of the optical position to this knot ,",
    "the upper limit for the core flux given in table [ fluxes ] is a point source fit to this southern knot , rather than 3 @xmath13 the on - source r.m.s . like the upper limits for the other non - detections .",
    "neither of these knots is a likely core candidate due to their extended nature and their steep 1.48.4 ghz spectrum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the two knots may be pieces of an inner twin jet structure , but their steep spectrum and the fact that they were transversely resolved by @xcite make this unlikely as well .",
    "an alternative possibility is that they constitute lobes of a restarting radio source .",
    "( figs . 2 - 4 ) .",
    "this source is probably undersampled at 1.4-ghz , and the total flux density is lower than some found in the literature .",
    "the 8.44-ghz map is well sampled and the total flux agrees ( within the errors ) with the value given in @xcite .",
    "the similar core fluxes at 1.4 and 8.44-ghz indicate a flat or slightly inverted spectrum that is typical of a radio core .",
    "the core positions from our two maps agree to within 0.5@xmath15 .",
    "this source was previously observed by @xcite but the faint emission regions transverse to the radio axis , particularly the western region , are more prominent in both our maps .",
    "these regions constitute a new example of ` wings ' ( cf .  leahy & perley 1991 ) .",
    "they are strongly polarized ( mean fractional polarization of @xmath12 50% at x - band ) and the apparent magnetic field is directed along the wings , transverse to the radio axis , as is typical in such features .",
    "the spectral index map also shows some interesting structure .",
    "the hotspots and core have the flattest spectra as expected , but the steep spectrum of the material around the hot spots at the sides of the source , particularly in the southern lobe , is unusual , since aged material is usually found only in the parts of the lobe nearest the core .",
    "this , together with the wings , suggests that the backflow velocities are very significant compared to hotspot advance speeds in this source .",
    "this source is probably undersampled at 8.44-ghz and the total flux density is somewhat lower than the values predicted from the spectral index and 5-ghz fluxes .",
    "the 1.4-ghz observation is well sampled and our total flux agrees with published values .",
    "an unresolved radio core is detected in the 8.44-ghz map .",
    "this core position lies 2.5@xmath15 nw of the optical position given in table [ sample ] .",
    "the errors in this core position are 0.5@xmath15 in r.a . and 0.2@xmath15 in dec . and the errors in the optical position are given in kristian , sandage & katem ( 1978 ) as @xmath12 1@xmath15 in each direction .",
    "the combined errors are not large enough to account for the difference in the two positions .",
    "this is probably due to an underestimate of the optical position errors .",
    "however , our optical images show another galaxy closer to the radio core position .",
    "preliminary measurements from these images show it to be within 1@xmath15 .",
    "the position for this second galaxy given in @xcite ( although they refer to it as `` starlike '' ) puts it 1.3@xmath15 from the radio core .",
    "this second galaxy is dimmer ( m@xmath17 = 21.2 vs. 20.6 ) and bluer ( g - r = 0.5 vs. 0.9 ) than the galaxy found at the optical position and , according to @xcite , is blueshifted relative to the galaxy found at the optical position by 1000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the 8.44-ghz map shows what appears to be a jet connecting the core to the northern lobe .",
    "the 1.4-ghz map shows a bulge of emission to the west , near the center of the source .",
    "the spectral index map shows the expected steepening back towards the core .",
    "the apparent jet in the northern lobe has a flatter spectrum than the material around it , which supports the idea that it actually is a jet rather than an extension of the lobe .",

    "[ fluxes ] agrees well with values found in the literature .",
    "the radio core position was measured from a higher resolution c - band map ( burns  1984 ) and is accurate to 0.5@xmath15 in each direction .",
    "this core lies 1.9@xmath15 se of the optical position listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "the errors in the optical position are unknown but , assuming they are 1@xmath15 in each direction , the combined radio and optical positional errors account for the difference between the two positions .",
    "optical images show no objects closer to the radio core .",
    "the 1.4-ghz map presented here shows no unusual features in this source .",
    "the degree of polarization at this frequency is unusually low ( averaging @xmath18% ) ; this may be evidence for intrinsic faraday rotation from the x - ray halo found around 3c220.1 by @xcite .",
    "( fig . 9 ) .",
    "although the las of this source is 0.94 @xmath13 @xmath9 of the configuration used to observe it at 1.4-ghz , this source may be undersampled as flux densities in the literature are larger than the total flux density measured from our map .",

    "this core lies 2.9@xmath15 ne of the optical position given in table [ sample ] .",
    "no errors are given for the core coordinates in @xcite but the errors in the optical position are listed as 7@xmath15 in @xcite and these are obviously sufficient to account for the positional difference .",
    "measurements from optical images show no objects closer to the radio core and put the core in the host galaxy ( although far from the center ) .",
    "the lobes in the 1.4-ghz map presented here seem to curve away from the radio axis near the center of the source .",
    "this behavior is seen in a number of other sources ( e.g. leahy & williams 1984 ) .",
    "the heads of the lobes seem to have a `` pinch '' in the emission located about one - third of the distance from the leading edge back towards the center of the source .",
    "this effect is also observed in other radio galaxies such as 3c349 ( hardcastle _ et al . _  1997",
    "; leahy & perley 1991 ) .",
    "a higher resolution l - band map in @xcite shows this pinching in the lobe shape more clearly , as well as some details of the hotspots .",
    "although our map of this giant source may be undersampled , the total flux density measured from our map is consistent with others in the literature .",
    "the core and a probable jet in the eastern lobe are visible in our 1.4-ghz map .",
    "both lobes appear to have double hot spots .",
    "the radio map of this broad - line radio galaxy is almost certainly undersampled , and the flux density measured from our map is lower than those found elsewhere .",
    "the core flux for this object is quite large and is a substantial portion ( 13% ) of the total flux .",
    "the core and a bright , knotty and slightly curved jet in the western lobe are clearly visible in the 1.4-ghz map .",
    "c - band maps can be found in @xcite and @xcite but ours is the first map to show details of the jet . the low axial ratio ( length to width ) of the source , the prominent core , the one - sided nature of the jet and the broad - line spectrum ( e.g.  eracleous & halpern 1994 ) are all consistent with the object being aligned close to the line of sight .",
    "hardcastle  ( 1998a ) suggest that low - power broad - line radio galaxies of this sort are a low - redshift equivalent of the high - redshift lobe - dominated quasars , and the radio structure of this object is certainly consistent with that picture .",
    "if the jet s one - sidedness is caused by relativistic beaming alone , then the jet - counterjet ratio of @xmath19 in the inner 30@xmath15 , corresponding to the straight part of the jet , implies an angle to the line of sight of @xmath20 and beaming velocities @xmath21 .",

    "the core flux in this case is only 23 mjy , substantially smaller than that measured directly from fig .",
    "the 1.4-ghz map shows a small , unusually asymmetrical source .",
    "the faint extension to the east and west of the bright northern lobe is probably a deconvolution artifact .",
    "the 4.86-ghz map shows a core with a strong northern lobe or hot spot with a probable bright backflow feature ( the inner northern component ) and a much weaker southern lobe or hot spot .",
    "a possible alternative interpretation is that the inner northern component is actually a foreground or background source .",
    "however , optical images show no evidence of another object near this position .",
    "the extension to the east of the northern lobe / hotspot in the 4.86-ghz map is probably a deconvolution artifact as well .",

    "a point source fit to this structure yields the core flux in table [ fluxes ] .",
    "this flux is not consistent with the fluxes measured by @xcite if his suggestion that the core is steep - spectrum holds at these lower frequencies ; however , the position of the core obtained from this fit lies less than 0.4@xmath15 from the core position of @xcite given in table [ radio - opt ] which was taken from his high resolution u - band ( 2 cm ) map .",
    "the c - band map of @xcite appears to be contaminated by imaging artifacts .",
