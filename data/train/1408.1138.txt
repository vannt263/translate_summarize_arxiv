    "* proposition  5.3 ) ) .",

    "it is natural to ask how these proper holomorphic maps behave at the boundary , and this question is especially interesting since the boundaries of @xmath7 and @xmath15 are non - lipschitz .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath6 and @xmath14 have @xmath16-smooth boundaries , then a proper holomorphic map from @xmath7 to @xmath15 extends to a @xmath16 map of the closures . in this paper",

    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - proper ] can be reduced to the study of the regularity in hlder spaces of certain integral operators closely related to the classical cauchy operator .",

    "note that @xmath58 , the cauchy transform , and we may call @xmath55 the _ symmetrized cauchy transform in @xmath4 variables . _ we prove the following regularity result for the map @xmath55 :    [ thm - an ] let @xmath59 be integers and let the boundary @xmath32 of @xmath6 be of class @xmath60 .",

    "our second example corresponds to the choice @xmath66 , where @xmath67 assuming that @xmath50 has @xmath51 components , the space @xmath68 has @xmath69 components , and one of these components is the @xmath4-fold cartesian product @xmath70 .",

    "then , for @xmath61 , the cauchy - nrlund transform @xmath71 is a continuous linear map from @xmath85 to @xmath75 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after reviewing some elementary properties of the operators @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath55 introduced above in section  [ sec - remarks ] , in section  [ sec - bnconvex ] we introduce the key observation ( proposition  [ prop - difference ] ) , that @xmath71 can be represented in terms of _ divided differences _ , discrete analogs of derivatives which occur in newton s interpolation formula .",
    "this , along with a representation of the divided difference allow us to prove theorem  [ thm - main ] for convex domains @xmath6 , and the general case follows in section  [ sec - thmmainproof ] by conformal mapping and a covering argument using the fact that bounded locally hlder functions are hlder . in section  [ sec - proofthman ] theorem  [ thm - an ] is deduced from theorem  [ thm - main ] and a distortion estimate for the map @xmath9 , which we obtain using the results of @xcite . finally , in section  [ sec - proper ] , a representation of proper holomorphic maps between symmetric products as an integral from @xcite is used along with theorem  [ thm - an ] to obtain theorem  [ thm - proper ] .",
    "we note here that the statements of theorem  [ thm - an ] and theorem  [ thm - proper ] can probably be improved , and slightly better regularity results may be obtained by more work .",
    "the non - optimality is because of possible loss of information in the course of the proof",

    "the integral defining @xmath36 makes sense at @xmath86 , provided @xmath87 does not vanish for any @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 . by differentiation under the integral sign , @xmath38 is a holomorphic function on @xmath39 , and by writing @xmath90 we see that @xmath39 , being the intersection of complements of complex hypersurfaces is pseudoconvex . in general , @xmath91 is not connected , and therefore , each of its components is pseudoconvex .",
    "suppose that @xmath50 consists of @xmath51 components , @xmath92 , where we can assume that @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 is unbounded and the other @xmath96 components are bounded .",
    "when @xmath97 , with @xmath49 as in , we can associate with any @xmath51-tuple of non - negative integers @xmath98 with @xmath99 , the subset of @xmath100 given by @xmath101 where for a fixed @xmath102 , we think of @xmath103 as a polynomial in the variable @xmath104 .",
    "an argument using continuity of roots as functions of coefficients shows that each of @xmath105 is connected .",
    "since @xmath52 is the disjoint union of the sets @xmath106 as the @xmath51-tuple @xmath98 ranges over all combinations such that @xmath99 , it follows that the connected components of the set @xmath107 are precisely the @xmath106 , of which , therefore , there are a total of @xmath108 we are particularly interested in the component @xmath109 , which is described by @xmath110 we claim that @xmath111 . indeed , let @xmath112 , and let @xmath113 be the roots of the polynomial @xmath114 .",
    "then , by the definition of @xmath109 , each @xmath115 belongs to @xmath6 .",
    "consider the point @xmath116 given by @xmath117 then , by the relationship between the roots and coefficients of a polynomial , we see that @xmath118 so that @xmath119 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath119 , let @xmath120 be such that @xmath118 . then clearly @xmath121 are the roots of the equation @xmath122 , so that @xmath112 .",
    "note that the above argument also proves the following fact , which will be used later . if @xmath123 are such that @xmath124 , then there is a permutation @xmath125 such that @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is as in .",
    "analogously , note that when @xmath66 , @xmath128 therefore , when @xmath50 has @xmath51 components , @xmath129 has @xmath69 components . in defining the operator @xmath130 , we restrict our attention to the component @xmath70 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath130 to @xmath131 and of @xmath55 to @xmath7 is motivated by the application to proper maps of symmetric products as in theorem  [ thm - proper ] .",
    "it is interesting to ask what happens in the other components , and whether there is a non - trivial analog of the sokhotski - plemelj jump formula for these transforms .",
    "preliminary investigations show that we should not expect boundedness in hlder topologies of the maps @xmath130 and @xmath55 when restricted to unbounded components of @xmath132 .",
    "further , along @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the @xmath135 and @xmath136 can not be defined as cauchy principal values for hlder continuous @xmath137 on @xmath32 , and in fact the integral defining the cauchy principal value blows up at some points of the boundary , depending on the geometry near that point .",
    "if we define for @xmath138 the set @xmath139 by @xmath140 where @xmath141 the disc centered at @xmath142 and radius @xmath143 , a computation shows that if @xmath144 for some @xmath61 , then @xmath145 where for a point @xmath138 , we denote by @xmath146 the largest integer @xmath20 such that we can find @xmath20 numbers in the @xmath4-tuple @xmath147 which are equal to each other .",
    "in particular , this shows that there is no hope for a simple generalization of the jump formula to the operator @xmath130 .",
