    "the damping of small - scale modes in the power spectrum of density fluctuations has been proposed to overcome potential observational difficulties at small scales of the hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario for structure formation (  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the damping in the power spectrum may be produced either during its primordial generation ( in the biased scalar inflationary models , for example ) or due to landau and free - streaming damping , which erase galactic or sub - galactic density fluctuations when the dark matter particles are warm ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; although the free - streaming damping could also be present in cdm models if cdm particles are non - thermally produced ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we study warm dark matter ( wdm ) models ; however , it is important to remark that our results are also valid for other models where the power spectrum is damped at small scales .",
    "a potential shortcoming of the cdm scenario , is the large amount of substructure ( satellites ) that is predicted for milky - way like halos with respect to observations under the assumption that at each small halo a dwarf galaxy is formed ( @xcite ; klypin et al . 1999 ; @xcite ; but see e.g. , @xcite for an alternative solution ) .",
    "the cosmological n - body experiments of coln et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter ) have shown that the observed satellite circular velocity function of milky way and andromeda can be reproduced if the power spectrum is exponentially damped ( filtered ) at scales @xmath6 mpc ( a flat cosmological model with @xmath7 and @xmath8 was used ) .",
    "a free - streaming scale  of @xmath9 is attained for particle masses  of @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite derived a lower limit for  of 750 ev from the restriction that the predicted power spectrum should reproduce the observed properties of the lyman@xmath11 forest in quasar spectra .    in  it",
    "was also found that the concentrations of satellite wdm halos decrease as  increases , being these concentrations lower than those of the corresponding cdm halos .",
    "unfortunately , these small halos were poorly resolved and we could not explore in detail the inner density profiles of halos with masses below . studying the density profiles of wdm halos with high resolution",
    "is necessary , in particular because another potential problem of the cdm scenario is related namely to the inner density profile and concentration of small halos .",
    "it seems to be a discrepancy between numerical simulation results and observations of dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies (  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) although other observational studies have challenged this result ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ; swaters , madore & trewhella 2000 ; van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) .    in the present paper the density profiles of wdm halos with masses close to or up to @xmath12 times smaller than  are studied with a mass resolution @xmath13 orders of magnitude larger than in .",
    "our conclusions will be based partly on simulations with a power spectrum corresponding to @xmath14 kev .",
    "however , in order to study with high resolution the halos with masses below , we need to increase .",
    "thus , we will also use simulations for @xmath15 kev ( @xmath16 ) and assume that the structure of halos should depend on the halo mass - to-  ratio rather than on the specific value of .",
    "the cosmogony of halos with masses @xmath17 is not hierarchical .",
    "halos with masses close to or larger than  by factors of @xmath18 assemble a large fraction of their present - day mass by a coherent and nearly monolithic collapse , whereas halos with masses smaller than  form from the gravitational fragmentation of larger pancake - like structures , as in the top - down scenario ( zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "firmani et al .",
    "( 2000b ) emphasized that the density profiles of dark halos formed through a monolithic collapse depend significantly on the velocity dispersion of the collapsing particles ( see also aguilar & merrit 1990 ) ; this velocity dispersion may be primordial ( thermal relict ) or can be acquired during an inhomogeneous gravitational collapse ( dynamical ) .",
    "the non - zero thermal velocities of warm particles ( warmons ) should produce minimal shallow halo cores because of the phase packing limit (  gunn & tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "however , this thermal velocity dispersion , , for warmons with masses of @xmath19 seems to be too small to produce a noticeable core ( hogan & dalcanton 2000 ) . in  this velocity",
    "was neglected , leaving uncertain the effect it could have on the structure of simulated halos ( sellwood 2000 ) . here",
    "we will include different thermal velocity values in the simulations in order to explore their influence on the halo density profile .",
    "an analytical ( dynamical ) approach will be also used to study the `` hot '' monolithic collapse and clarify the conditions required to form shallow cores .    after the completion of this paper , a similar paper by bode , ostriker , & turok ( 2000 ) appeared in the preprint list of los alamos national laboratory .",
    "bode et al .",
    "study the cosmogony and structure of halos for models with damped power spectra in a cosmological box .",
    "they also find that halos with masses below the filtering mass are less concentrated and that these halos form later , relative to cdm .",
    "in addition to this , they also describe the spatial distribution and the mass function of these small halos ; in this sense , their study complement ours .    in section ",
    "2 we present the wdm models to be explored in this paper . in ",
    "3 we briefly describe the numerical simulations . in",
    " 4 we present the results from our experiments aimed to study the density profiles and concentrations of halos with masses below the mass corresponding to the filtering scale .",
    "the influence of the velocity dispersion over the inner density profile of halos formed by monolithic collapse is explored in  5.1 . in ",
    "5.2 we present results from our wdm cosmological simulations including the thermal velocity dispersion of warmons . in  6.1 we describe and discuss how structure formation proceeds in simulations with a power spectrum suppressed at small scales .",
    "the viability of the wdm scenario is disscused in  6.2 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "as in , here we also use the currently favored flat low - density universe with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath20 , and instead of cdm we introduce wdm . two characteristics distinguish wdm from cdm : the damping of the small - scale density fluctuations and the fact that thermal velocity dispersion might not be negligible at the time of structure formation . the free - streaming length  is related to the mass of the warmon through the following equation (  @xcite ) : @xmath21 where  is the contribution to the energy density of the universe from wdm .",
    "modifications to eq .",
    "( 1 ) exist ; for example , a larger coefficient of proportionality is given by pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . using their coefficient , for a given",
    ",  should be roughly two times larger than the values used here .",
    "we follow sommer - larsen & dolgov and define a characteristic free - streaming wavenumber @xmath22 as the @xmath23 for which the wdm transfer function ( eq . [ 4 ] ) is one half ; that is , @xmath24 .",
    "once  has been fixed ( this is the `` true '' input parameter in our simulations ) , a characteristic filtering mass  can be defined conditionally .",
    "unfortunately , this has not been done in an unique way in the literature , introducing some confusion ; its value can vary by about three orders of magnitude from one definition to another .",
    "for instance , defining  simply as @xmath25 gives a value 318 times smaller than the value obtained with the definition given by sommer - larsen & dolgov ( 2000 ) , which we use in this paper : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "this definition of @xmath28 is justified by the numerical experiments of @xcite .",
    "they found that the initial density distribution produced by a sharp cut in the power spectrum at @xmath29 ( the exponential drop in the power spectrum in our case is at @xmath30 ) is similar to that one produced when the initial density field is convolved with a top - hat window of smoothing radius @xmath31 .",
    "the analysis of the halo properties below shows that the mass at which the wdm halos begin to diverge from the cdm ones is just around the mass given by eq .",
    "we use the wdm power spectrum given in bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) : @xmath32 where the wdm transfer function is approximated by @xmath33\\ ] ] and @xmath34 is the cdm power spectrum given by @xcite ( see ) .",
    "the simulations were performed using the multiple - mass scheme variant of the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) n - body code ( @xcite ) .",
    "the art code achieves high spatial resolution by refining the base uniform grid in all high - density regions with an automated refinement algorithm . the multiple - mass scheme , described in detail elsewhere ( klypin et al . 2000 ; see also ) , is used to increase the mass and spatial resolution in few _ selected _ halos , which hereafter we will call hosts as in . however , while in the host halos were structures much larger than  and selected to be relatively isolated , here , in simulations with large , they are smaller than  and can be embedded within filaments and can belong to groups at the intersection of filaments . on the other hand , in both cdm and wdm , we call guest halos the bound structures surviving within the virial radii of the host halos . these definitions are more technical than conceptual ; note that in the simulations just mentioned above , the host halos contain guest halos , but on their own they may be `` guests '' of other larger systems .",
    "we start our simulations by making a low mass resolution run with @xmath35 or @xmath36 particles in a grid with @xmath37 cells in which all particles have the same mass .",
    "we use these runs to select ( host ) halos to be re - simulated with higher mass and force resolution .",
    "we then identify all particles within @xmath38 virial radii and trace them back to get their lagrangian positions at @xmath39 .",
    "for the cosmology used in this paper , the virial radius  is defined as the radius within which the average halo density is 334 times the background density , according to the spherical collapse model .",
    "next , the initial distribution with particles with different masses is generated and the models are evolved to the present time with the multiple - mass variant of art . models with @xmath40 have four mass levels ( particles with masses 1 , 8 , 64 , 256 @xmath41 ) whereas models with @xmath42 have three levels .",
    "the mass resolution on the finest mass level corresponds to a box of @xmath37 particles in both series of simulations .    as in , the bound density maxima ( bdm )",
    "group finding algorithm was used to locate the host halos in the low mass resolution run .",
    "the bdm algorithm finds the positions of local maxima in the density field smoothed at the scale of interest and applies physically motivated criteria to test whether a group of particles is a gravitationally bound system .",
    "the bdm is also used to find the host and the guest halos in the multiple - mass high resolution simulations .    in table 1",
    "we present an overview of all the simulations used in this paper .",
    "the formal force resolution shown in column 6 is the size of a cell in the finest refinement grid , and the mass per particle ( column 4 ) is the mass for those particles which belong to the finest level of mass resolution .",
    "the halo density profile can be studied with high confidence only for radii larger than @xmath43 times the formal force resolution ( klypin et al .",
    "2000 ) and containing within them more than 50 - 100 particles .",
    "the first set of runs in table 1 was aimed at studying in detail the density profiles and concentrations of halos with virial masses close to or below the corresponding filtering mass .",
    "model  is the same simulation presented in  for @xmath44  but run in a smaller box , @xmath45 , in order to attain more mass resolution .",
    "the host halo studied in this run is @xmath46 times less massive than the same halo in the run with @xmath47 .",
    "is reduced .",
    "however , this mass reduction is not dramatic , and we do not expect it will change our conclusions about concentrations and density profiles of the halos , because they both are not typically very dependent on mass . ] unfortunately , in the simulation with the box size reduced , the most massive guest halos turned out to be small , containing less than 1000 particles .    since it is not easy to know the masses of the guest halos _ a priori _ , and since our aim is just to explore the density profiles of halos with masses smaller than , a better strategy is to study halos in simulations where we select them _ a priori _ ( hosts ) , with the desired masses below .",
    "although from the technical point of view of our approach these halos are hosts , they may be well embedded within larger halos , i.e. , they could be satellites ( guests ) .",
    "we set @xmath42 which corresponds to @xmath48 , and re - simulate with high resolution smaller and smaller host halos in runs with decreasing box sizes .",
    "for this model ( = 125 ev ) , the structure formation process is close to the hot dark matter regime .",
    "nevertheless , in the assumption that the formation and structure of halos depend on @xmath49 rather than the specific value of , this model will give guidance to the physics on smaller scales in a model with a more realistic warmon mass .",
    "we think this assumption is plausible . in any case ,",
    "general trends can be compared with the ( low resolution ) results from simulations with = 605 ev .",
    "runs , , , and  ( table 1 ) , are for @xmath50 and 60 , respectively for comparison , we also run a cdm simulation ( @xmath51 ) with the same initial condition as  ( run ) . in model  we re - simulated four host halos with masses @xmath52 times smaller than .",
    "they were resolved with @xmath53 particles . in order to obtain halos with masses even @xmath54 times smaller but with the same mass resolution",
    ", we reduced the box size by a factor of two .",
    "this is run , where four halos with masses @xmath55 times smaller than  were re - simulated . in run ,",
    "the only host halo re - simulated is already 45 times smaller than  and has @xmath56 particles .",
    "the guest halos ( those contained within the virial radii of hosts ) in all of these simulations have masses smaller than @xmath0  and are resolved with @xmath57 particles .",
    "finally , in run  the selected halo is 300 times less massive than  and it is resolved with @xmath58 particles .    at this point , it is important to note the effect that a reduction of the box size has on the results from wdm simulations . in cdm simulations",
    "we do not expect that a reduction in the box size affects the internal structure of halos with radii much smaller than @xmath59 ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "however , in wdm simulations the loss of long wavelengths may critically affect the formation and the structure of halos if the fundamental wavelength ( @xmath60 ) is close to or smaller than the characteristic filtering wavelength @xmath61 .",
    "when dealing with wdm power spectra , one should keep in mind that structures of scales smaller than @xmath62 arise from a transfer of power from large to small scales ( see  6.1 ) . hence ,",
    "if the large scale modes are omitted , especially those around the peak , then the formation of small structures becomes affected . for cdm",
    "this is not a problem because small scales have ever more power than the large ones and the structure formation process is dominated by the smallest scales .",
    "since the filtering wavelength for @xmath42 is @xmath63 ( see  2 ) , run  is at the limit of confidence while for run , the mode corresponding to the peak of the wdm power spectrum is absent ( the fundamental mode lies beyond the peak ) .",
    "the density profile of the halo re - simulated in this peculiar model ( a narrow and exponentially damped power spectrum ) indeed strongly deviates from profiles of halos obtained in other wdm simulations with larger box sizes as will be seen in  4 .",
    "the second set of simulations shown in table 1 was aimed at studying the effect that a warmon non - zero thermal velocity , , has on the internal structure of simulated halos . from this study we conclude that  does not affect the inner density profile of wdm halos , at least down to the scale at which we are confident of the resolution of our simulations ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "run  is the same as  ( @xmath44 mpc ) but introducing a thermal velocity component twice larger than .",
    "runs , , and , are the same as  ( @xmath64 ) but introducing thermal velocities with amplitudes 2 , 4 and 16 times larger than the corresponding .    in order to attain a visual impression of how structure formation does proceed for models with a damped power spectrum , we present in fig .",
    "1a snapshots at diferent epochs of the run .",
    "the figure snapshots show the distribution of particles inside a cube of 40   comoving on a side .",
    "the center of each cube is the center of mass of the particles that were traced back to the selected epoch from a sphere of radius 1.5  centered in one of the host halos at @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "1c , see below ) . in figure",
    "1b we show the same as in fig . 1a , but for the corresponding cdm model , run .",
    "the different formation histories of halos with masses @xmath66 or below in models with and without damped power spectra are highlighted in these two panels ; in particular , we notice that these halos ( i ) form later in model than in  ( the amount of substructure at @xmath67 in model  is reduced to a solitary sharp filament ) and ( ii ) that they are only located within filaments in the wdm case while in the cdm one , they can also be found outside the filaments ( see also bode et al .",
    "2001 ) . in fig .",
    "1c we show a zoom of the central region of plot 1a at two times , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in the right panel all particles inside a sphere of 1.5  centered on a host halo at @xmath69 are plotted .",
    "the mass of this halo is about half the filtering mass ( @xmath70 ) and it was one of the first structures to collapse in the simulation . in the left panel , the particles plotted in the right panel were traced back to @xmath68 .",
    "note that the virialized halos seem to emerge from the filamentation and fragmentation of panckakes . in any case , the detailed study of halo formation in wdm - like models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an effect that is becoming typical of cosmological high - resolution simulations with damped power spectra is the finding of relatively small halos regularly spaced in filaments .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "1a at @xmath71 ; see those knots that lie inside the filament which points from right to left to the center of the cube .",
    "several of these knots were indeed selected by our halo finding algorithm as self - gravitating structures .",
    "the space regularity , also seen in other of our simulations , make us to suspect that the origin of these very small halos with respect to  may be a numerical artifact attributed perhaps to finite grid effects .",
    "a detailed study of this effect is highly desirable since it might produce an steepening of the circular velocity function distribution of satellites at the small velocity end .",
    "in  host halos of a few @xmath72 were re - simulated using the multiple - mass scheme in a box size of 15  for a @xmath73cdm model with @xmath44 .",
    "the mass per particle in the finest level of resolution corresponded to @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the guest halos reported in  ( with scales below the filtering scale ) were poorly resolved ; they only had a few @xmath75 particles , a number not high enough to study in detail their inner density profiles .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath76 , we also run the same simulation of   but with the box size reduced by a factor of two ( run ) .",
    "we find that the most massive guest halos are smaller than the most massive ones from the 15  run , in such a way that they were resolved with not much more particles than in .",
    "figure 2 ( upper panel ) shows the density profiles of the host and guest halos with more than 1000 particles ( the latter were shifted vertically in order to avoid too much overlapping ) .",
    "the radius of the innermost point is at least four times the formal force resolution and contains more than 50 particles within it ( see  3 ; this criteria applies for all density profiles shown in this paper ) . for the host halo ,",
    "the innermost radius is @xmath77 , and for the guest halos is @xmath78 .",
    "as one sees from figure 2 , the density profiles of guest halos  whose masses are @xmath0 times smaller than the filtering mass @xmath79  are well described by the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 , nfw ) profile ( dashed lines ) , from @xmath80 to 1 .    as described in  3 , for a series of @xmath73wdm simulations with @xmath81 and different box sizes , we re - simulated with high resolution selected halos ( hosts ) with masses smaller than the corresponding @xmath82 , obtaining in this way halos with a large number particles .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the density profiles of the host halos with masses @xmath52 times smaller than  from run  ( filled circles ) and those obtained in the same simulation but with cdm instead of wdm ( run , empty circles ) .",
    "although both simulations started with identical phases ( seeds ) and large scale normalization , the cdm halos are slightly more massive than the corresponding wdm ones ( by factors @xmath83 ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the nfw fit to the plotted profiles .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the nfw shape describes rather well the density profiles of both the wdm and cdm halos , for radius ranging from @xmath0 to 1 , although in the innermost parts , the slope tends to be steeper than @xmath84 , in particular for the cdm halos ( moore et al .",
    "the accuracy of the fit can be estimated with the parameter @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ^ 2 $ ] ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the measured and analytical values of the density , respectively ) is the quantity used for minimization of the fitting , and @xmath89 is the number of radial bins ( points to fit ) .",
    "for the host halos in runs  and , on average @xmath90% and 5.5% , respectively .    in order to explore the structure of halos with masses much smaller than",
    ", we have run simulations with the same = 1.7  but with box sizes of 30 , 15 and 7.5  ( runs , , and , respectively ) ; in these simulations we re - simulate host halos with masses of @xmath91 .",
    "note that these halos may be embedded within larger halos , i.e. they could be satellites ( see  3 for the technical definitions of host and guest halos ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the density profiles of the four host halos obtained in the run  ( upper panel ) , and of the two host halos obtained in runs  and  ( lower panel ) . for comparison , the density profile of a cdm halo of @xmath92 presented in",
    "is also plotted ( empty circles ) .",
    "though now the masses of the halos are up to @xmath9350 times smaller than , the nfw fit ( dashed lines ) continues to be a good description for the density profiles of wdm halos explored with accuracy down to @xmath0 .",
    "the deviation parameter @xmath94 is on average @xmath95% for host halos from run  and @xmath933.5% for the only host halo from run . nonetheless , the wdm halos are less concentrated and shallower in the center than their cdm counterparts .",
    "the density profile of the host halo from simulation shows a prominent shallow core and a disturbed outer density profile . as this run has a box size already smaller than the filtering wavelength @xmath61 , it samples only the high - frequency drop of the wdm power spectrum ; we thus expect the inner structure of the formed halo to be significantly affected ( see  3 ) .",
    "the results obtained here confirm our previous result : the wdm halos with masses near or below the filtering mass are _ less concentrated _ than the corresponding cdm halos ( ) . in figure 5a we plot the c@xmath96 concentration parameter is defined as the ratio between the virial radius and the radius where 1/5 of the total halo mass is contained ( avila - reese et al .",

    "1999 and fig . 8 below )",

    "there are two relevant conditions for the problem of halo formation , namely the initial fluctuation density profile which determines the kind of collapse the halo suffers and the amplitude of the ( tangential ) velocity dispersion   of the collapsing particles .",

    "the first structures to collapse are those with masses close to ; they assemble the mass  almost synchronously followed by some mass accretion ( quasi - monolithic collapse ) .",
    "it is possible that structures formed by fragmentation also suffer a quasi - monolithic collapse . as the collapse of halos less massive than  is delayed and the amount of substructure is small ( compared to halos formed hierarchically )",

    "one should take into account that in the cosmological simulations , the studied halos do not suffer a perfect monolithic collapse , and that some velocity dispersion can be acquired during the collapse of the pancakes and filaments .",
    "in conclusion , the introduction of a warmon relict thermal velocity has no any important effect on the density profiles and concentrations of wdm halos .",
    "this velocity would have to be much larger in order to produce noticeable soft cores , as eq .",

    "we should note that simulations with and without a thermal velocity are not similar at all .",
    "the identity of the guest halos is not the same for all of them and their spatial distribution is different in both simulations .",
    "however , in a statistical sense , neither the concentrations nor the satellite circular velocity function change .",
    "when the power spectrum of fluctuations is damped above some wavenumber @xmath22 , `` pancakes '' of size @xmath172 are the first structures to collapse and smaller objects are expected to form later by fragmentation ( e.g. , zeldovich 1970 ; doroshkevich et al .",

    "although our numerical experiments were not aimed at studying the structure formation process in a statistical sense ( for this see bode et al .",
    "2000 ) , we noticed that indeed the first structures to collapse are those with scales close to the filtering scale length @xmath61 .",
    "these structures form smooth coherent filaments when they enter the non - linear regime ( fig . 1a ; see also melott & shandarin 1990 ; little et al .",

    "nonetheless , matter flows towards the center of the filament and some spherical symmetry is established there ( see the virialized halo at @xmath65 ) . within the shrinking filament , substructure probably forms by fragmentation .",

    ", the power transfer from larger to smaller scales is very efficient .",
    "it also seems that the collapse epoch of the fragmented halos is independent of their masses .",
    "nevertheless , all these halos collapse on average later than in a cdm simulation .",
    "this might explain why the small wdm halos are less concentrated and why their concentrations , though with a large scatter , do not depend on mass ( see fig .",
    "because halos are less concentrated than in the cdm simulations , they are more easily disrupted . as was shown in ,",
    "the reduction of the number of small halos due to this effect is comparable to the effect that the power spectrum suppression has on this number , and both work together to deliver a very small number of satellites at @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , our results suggest that on average and in a first approximation , the density profiles of dark matter halos are indeed universal , no matter how they form , either by hierarchical clustering or by a monolithic collapse or by fragmentation ( see also moore et al .",
    "the difference seen in their concentrations can be explained just as an _ effect of the formation epoch , which for small wdm halos is delayed compared to the formation epoch of their cdm counterparts_. as we have shown in  5 , a way to affect significantly the inner density profile of halos in the case of a monolithic collapse is by including a high ( tangential ) velocity dispersion .",
    "the thermal velocities of warmons of mass @xmath19 are much smaller than this required velocity dispersion .      because of the increasing evidence that the predictions of the nowadays standard @xmath73cdm model at small scales are in conflict with observations , modifications to this scenario , _ able to retain their successful predictions at large scales , _",
    "have been recently analyzed .",
    "as the nature of dark matter particles is still a mystery , it is tempting to exchange cdm particles for wdm particles as the most simple modification to the standard scenario . at least from the point of view of the particle physics",

    "@xmath176 , and @xmath177 , the observed maximum circular velocity function of milky way and andromeda satellites is roughly reproduced ( ) .",
    "although in the wdm scenario the halos with masses close to or below  do not have a noticeable constant density core , they are less concentrated and have a density profile shallower in the center than their cdm counterparts (   4 and 5 ) .",
    "recent observational studies have shown that with the current data is not possible to accurately constrain the halo inner density profiles of dwarf and lsb galaxies ; these profiles are probably not steeper than @xmath84 and , if anything , the concentrations of these halos are lower than those predicted in the cdm scenario ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 ; swaters , madore & trewhella 2000 ; van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) . in fig .",
    "9 we compare the c@xmath96 concentration of guest wdm halos from runs  and  with the c@xmath96 concentration of dwarf and lsb galaxies , inferred from observational data ( see details in the figure caption ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is not an overlap between the theoretical and observational data ; nonetheless , it can already be appreciated that the guest wdm halos are in better agreement with observations .",
    "the formation of disks within wdm halos ( @xmath178 ) in n - body+hydrodynamic simulations does not seem to suffer from the disk angular momentum problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "this problem is also at the basis of other difficulty reported by steinmetz & navarro ( 1998 ) : the predicted infrared tully - fisher ( tf ) relation in their simulations is much brighter than the observed one .",
    "the maximum circular velocity @xmath179 of the system increases after disk formation . in the numerical simulations of steinmetz & navarro this increase is about a factor of two larger than for models where detailed angular momentum conservation is assumed for the infalling gas ( e.g. , mo , mao , & white 1998 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "1998 ; avila - reese & firmani 2000 ; firmani & avila - reese 2000 ) .",
    "a factor of two in the velocity translates into a factor of @xmath180 in mass or luminosity explaining why steinmetz & navarro obtain a brighter tf relation .",
    "if the angular momentum problem is alleviated as in the wdm scenario , then one expects that the zero - point of the tf relation predicted in numerical simulations will be in agreement with observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "several authors have shown that the tf relation of normal disk galaxies in the infrared band is an imprint of the mass - velocity ( @xmath181 ) relation of cdm halos ( firmani & avila - reese 2000 and more references therein ) .",
    "for masses larger than @xmath182 , there are not major differences between the cdm and the wdm halos (; see also avila - reese et al .",

    "10 we have plotted @xmath183 versus @xmath179 for our wdm models with @xmath40 .",
    "we also show in this figure the @xmath184 relation of guest halos obtained for a @xmath73cdm simulation , its scatter and a linear fit to this relation ( avila - reese et al .",
    "as expected , the wdm halos move towards the lower @xmath179 side .",
    "the formation of dwarf galaxies may be strongly affected by feedback and reionization ; these galaxies could lose some of their initial baryon matter through galactic winds (  mac low & ferrara 1999 ) or through photo - evaporation ( shapiro & raga 2000 ) and thus see their luminosities diminished . in the tf plot",
    "this means that for a given luminosity , @xmath179 shifts to larger values .",
    "observations show that dwarf and normal galaxies have roughly the same infrared tf relation ; if anything , dwarf galaxies lie more on the low - velocity side and present more scatter ( pierini & tuffs 1999 ; de jong & lacey 2000 , quoted by @xcite , see their fig .",
    "therefore , the fact that for wdm the small halos are shifted in the @xmath184 relation as it is shown in fig .",
    "10 might resolve a potential problem of the cdm scenario .",
    "therefore , it seems that the _ wdm scenario could reproduce the infrared tf relation of dwarf galaxies better than the cdm scenarios does_.    \\5 . unlike in the cdm scenario , for wdm one",
    "expects that the satellite dwarf galaxies form later than the host large galaxies .",

    "the scale factor normalized to one at present is given in the first column while the number of halos with maximum circular velocity @xmath179 greater than 100  is presented in column 2 .",
    "columns 4 , 5 , and 6 give the coordinates of the center of mass of the system composed by these halos .",
    "the total number of halos with @xmath185 that contain more than 200 particles and the mass of the most massive halo are given in columns 3 and 7 , respectively .",
    "we see that the first structure starts to assemble at @xmath186 ; this seed has a mass of @xmath187 .",
    "later , at @xmath188 , when the mass of the most massive halo has grown to @xmath189 , the first substructures appear by fragmentation .",
    "thus , the building blocks for large galactic and supra - galactic structures are those with masses near to ; smaller structures ( guest halos ) form slightly later by fragmentation .",
    "we may say thus that the formation redshift of guest halos is approximately equal or less than @xmath190 .",
    "for the @xmath73wdm model with the power spectrum normalized to cobe used here and according to the spherical top - hat model , the typical formation redshift of @xmath191 halos is @xmath192 and 3.7 for @xmath193 and @xmath194 peaks , respectively .",

    "<S> using high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations , we study how the density profiles of dark matter halos are affected by the filtering of the density power spectrum below a given scale length and by the introduction of a thermal velocity dispersion . in the warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenario , both the free - streaming scale , , and the velocity dispersion , , are determined by the mass  of the wdm particle . </S>",
    "<S> we found that  is too small to affect the density profiles of wdm halos . </S>",
    "<S> down to the resolution attained in our simulations ( @xmath0 virial radii ) , there is not any significant difference in the density profiles and concentrations of halos obtained in simulations with and without the inclusion of . resolved soft cores appear only when we increase artificially the thermal velocity dispersion to a value which is much higher than . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the size of soft cores in a monolithic collapse is related to the tangential velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the density profiles of the studied halos with masses down to @xmath0 the filtering mass  can be described by the navarro - frenk - white shape ; soft cores are not formed . nevertheless , the concentrations of these halos are lower than those of the cdm counterparts and are approximately independent of mass . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmogony of halos with masses @xmath1 is not hierarchical : they form through monolithic collapse and by fragmentation of larger structures . </S>",
    "<S> the formation epoch of these halos is slightly later than that of halos with masses @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower concentrations of wdm halos with respect to their cdm counterparts can be accounted for their late formation epoch .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , our results point to a series of advantages of a wdm model over the cdm one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to solving the substructure problem , a wdm model with @xmath3 mpc ( @xmath4 ; flat cosmology with @xmath5 ) also predicts concentrations , a tully - fisher relation , and formation epochs for small halos which seems to be in better agreement with observations relative to cdm predictions .    </S>",
