    "recent years have witnessed a substantial growth of interest in developing nonlinear - optical techniques for the control of the state of polarization ( sop ) of light beams .",
    "the motivation behind such research activities is twofold .",
    "first of all , nonlinear optical techniques may permit replacing the inefficient and lossy method of polarizing a light beam by conventional passive linear polarizers with a the lossless polarization attraction of an arbitrary initial sop towards the desired sop at the output of a nonlinear medium .",
    "a key advantage of using lossless polarization attraction is that , in contrast with passive linear polarizers , input signal sop changes do not lead to output signal intensity fluctuations or relative intensity noise ( rin ) .",
    "the second goal is to find efficient ways to excercise all - optical control over the sop of a signal beam by exploiting its nonlinear interaction with a pump beam with a well - determined sop .",
    "here we analyse a novel method for achieving the all - optical control of the sop of a signal beam , namely exploiting the four - wave - mixing - mediated process of parametric amplification in a standard telecom optical fiber .    in short , nonlinear - optical methods",
    "allow for designing novel types of polarizers with much greater functionality than conventional passive linear polarizers .",
    "so far , two distinctly different types of nonlinear - optical polarizers were proposed .",
    "the first class comprises the so - called nonlinear lossless polarizers ( nlps ) , which are based on the cross - polarization modulation ( xpolm ) of two intense beams in a kerr medium . to the second class",
    "belong the so - called raman polarizers , which are based on the polarization - sensitive raman amplification of a signal beam in a raman - active medium .",
    "these two types of polarizers exploit the two complementary manifestations of the cubic nonlinearity of fibers ",
    "conservative for inducing xpolm effect , and dissipative which is responsible for the raman effect . here",
    ", we exploit the same cubic nonlinearity , more precisely its conservative part , for initiating the process of polarization - sensitive four - wave mixing ( fwm ) between three beams .",
    "the first nlp was proposed and experimentally demonstrated by heebner _",
    "et al _ in ref .",
    "it was based not on the kerr nonlinearity , but on a photorefractive effect .",
    "this polarizer was capable of transforming , in a lossless manner , a light beam with an arbitrary initial sop into a beam with one and the same sop towards its output .",
    "the principle of operation of this device was the conversion of energy from one polarization component of the beam into its orthogonal polarization component .",
    "photorefractive materials are characterized by a nonlinear response which is far too slow to be useful in contemporary ultrafast optics .",
    "in contrast , the kerr nonlinearity of silica is virtually instantaneous , which makes optical fibers a promising medium for implementing lossless polarizers within high - bit - rate telecom networks .",
    "the progress in developing fiber - based nlps started from impractical isotropic fibers @xcite and evolved towards cheap and reliable telecom fibers @xcite or specialty fibers such as highly - birefringent and spun fibers @xcite .",
    "the mathematical aspects of the problem were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and allowed to get further insight into the physics of fiber - based nlps , whose principle of operation is different from that of photorefractive lossless polarizers . instead of the self - interaction of a single beam in a photorefractive material , a two - beam cross - interaction ( namely , xpolm )",
    "is used in the kerr medium .",
    "namely , an auxiliary pump beam with a well - defined sop is employed , serving as a polarization reference for the signal beam with arbitrary initial sop . as previously outlined , when using lossless polarizers input signal sop fluctuations do not lead to output rin @xcite .",
    "another type of nonlinear - optical polarizer is the raman polarizer .",
    "it is different from conventional raman amplifiers by its sensitivity to the sop of the pump beam .",
    "the signal which experiences raman amplification acquires an sop which is dictated by the sop of the pump . in this way we may exercise an all - optical control over the polarization of the signal beam .",
    "note that conventional fiber - optic raman amplifiers operate in the regime where the output sop of the signal is independent on the pump sop .",
    "the first raman polarizer was demonstrated by martinelli _ et .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , followed by a number of theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "similar polarization - sensitive amplification was predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite for the brillouin amplification of a signal beam in standard optical fibers .",
    "these devices can be similarly called brillouin polarizers .",
    "since they are based on a gain mechanism , which is maximum whenever the signal and pump sops are aligned and zero when they are orthogonal , in general both raman and brillouin - based polarizers suffer from severe output rin in the presence of input signal sop fluctuations .",
    "a common feature uniting all of these nonlinear fiber - optic polarizers is that they can operate efficiently only in the limit of vanishing polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) .",
    "pmd is the effect which is caused by random variations of the magnitude and/or orientation of the birefringence along the fiber length , and it is acquired as a result of inevitable technical imperfectnesses in the process of drawing a fiber from a preform .",
    "recent progress in fiber manufacturing brought to the market fibers with much lower values of pmd than it was previously available .",
    "it is this technological breakthrough that made it possible the observation of the previously discussed polarization - sensitive effects in optical fibers .",
    "theoretical estimates show that the smaller the pmd coefficient , the shorter the total fiber length and the smaller the frequency separation of the signal and the pump beams , the better the performance of all of the above described polarizers .",
    "it is one of the main goals of a theory to be able to predict the degradation rate of useful polarization attraction effects which is caused by pmd .",
    "such degradation rates for nlps and raman polarizers have been calculated analytically in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the concept of all of these smart polarizers is not limited to fiber - optics applications only . indeed",
    ", nonlinear polarizers can be implemented with any optical waveguide exhibiting kerr and/or raman nonlinearity .",
    "using integrated optics waveguides may lift the problems which are associated with fiber pmd , and even make nonlinear polarizers less bulky and more compact , providing that the waveguide material exhibits nonlinear coefficients which are much larger than silica .",
    "for example , the silicon - based raman polarizer proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is free of the pmd - induced degradation and has a cm - long size as compared to the km - long fibers , thanks to three - four orders of magnitude raman gain enhancement in silicon with respect to silica .",
    "the present theoretical study extends the concept of nonlinear polarizers to the fwm process in telecom fibers .",
    "the goal here is to find the conditions upon which the process of parametric amplification is sensitive to the sop of the pump beam .",
    "in this way we arrive to the notion of a fwm - polarizer , meaning that the sop of the amplified signal beam is determined by the sop of the fully polarized pump beam .",
    "we derive here the coupled wave equations for the pump , idler , and signal beams . in the limit of zero pmd ,",
    "these equations reduce to the equations which were previously derived by mckinstrie _ et .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite for describing degenerate fwm in standard fibers",
    ". the major advantage of our theory is its applicability ( slightly ) beyond the zero - pmd limit , in the sense that it is capable of predicting the degradation rate of the efficiency of the fwm - polarizer for low - pmd fibers as well . knowing this degradation rate allows one to properly design practical fiber based nonlinear polarizers .",
    "the present work substantially extends to the case of random birefringence telecom fibers a previous study of polarization attraction in deterministic , high - birefringence optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "note that the polarization - sensitive parametric amplification in optical fibers was studied theoretically by lin and agrawal @xcite , and also theoretically and experimentally by freitas _ et .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite and resulted in a proposal of a fiber - based polarization switch .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , fwm - based polarizers are based on the polarization sensitivity of parametric gain .",
    "such gain is maximum for a signal sop which is aligned with that of the pump , and zero for a signal sop orthogonal to the pump .",
    "thus fwm - polarizers are not immune from output rin resulting from input signal polarization fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , since parametric gain is generally larger than raman gain in silica fibers , fwm - polarizers may employ shorter fibers or lower pump powers than raman polarizers .",
    "in addition , since the repolarization capability of fwm polarizers is based on parametric gain , these devices provide a more flexible control over the gain and repolarization bandwidth .",
    "indeed , such bandwidth may be extended up to 70 nm and even include the normal dispersion regime by properly engineering the wavelength dependence of the fiber dispersion and by adjusting the pump power  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the process of degenerate four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) .",
    "this process involves three waves with frequencies that satisfy the matching condition @xmath0 .",
    "pump , signal , and idler waves are labeled correspondingly as @xmath1 .",
    "all three waves are co - propagating along the @xmath2 direction in a telecommunication ( i.e. randomly birefringent ) fiber .",

    "this limit corresponds to vanishing pmd , and it is quite natural to call it as manakov limit . in this limit",
    "the conversion of the pump energy into the signal is maximally efficient , and therefore parametric amplifiers should be designed in such a way that the fwm diffusion length @xmath51^{-1}$ ] is much longer than the fiber length @xmath52 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our theory for the first time analytically predicts the length scale ( @xmath53 ) of degradation of the process of parameteric amplification in telecom fibers .",
    "strictly speaking , our theory is valid in two limits : @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the opposite limit ( the limit of large pmd , which we call diffusion limit ) where @xmath55 , the fwm process is totally suppressed .",
    "therefore this regime is not interesting from the viewpoint of frequency conversion .",
    "most likely , the intermediate case of @xmath56 can be adequately treated only numerically , however we believe that the exponential decay of the nonlinear coefficients provides a qualitatively correct description of the rate of degradation .",
    "another length scale ( @xmath57^{-1}$ ] ) appears in eqs.([3]-[5 ] ) , which is called the pmd diffusion length .",
    "this length is a characteristic which also enters the theory of two - beam nonlinear interactions .",
    "this length scale was introduced by lin and agrawal in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of fiber - optic raman amplifiers , and it was identified as the typical length at which the mutual orientation of the states of polarization of the pump and signal beams is scrambled as a result of pmd .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this very same length scale not only characterizes the  polarization memory \" of raman interactions , but it also characterizes the degradation of cross - polarization modulation ( xpolm ) mediated kerr - interactions of the two beams , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two length scales , @xmath53 and @xmath58 , shows that polarization sensitive frequency conversion is a more demanding process than polarization sensitive raman amplification and xpolm - induced polarization attraction in telecom fibers , in the sense that its degradation is characterized by an eight times faster spatial degradation rate . in order to overcome this detrimental degradation process",
    "an experimentalist needs to select an ultra - low pmd highly nonlinear fiber . as the degradation rate depends quadratically on the frequency difference between signal and pump",
    ", the effect of pmd can be also viewed as setting an upper limit to the bandwidth of the simultaneous parametric amplification and repolarization process .",
    "in this section we shall apply eqs.([3]-[5 ] ) to describe the effect of polarization attraction of a signal or idler wave towards the sop of a copropagating pump beam by means of fwm in a randomly birefringent telecom fiber .",
    "we will limit our analysis here to the small signal case , i.e. , we make the undepleted pump approximation .",
    "as we shall see , this approximation permits us to obtain relatively simple analytical results for the effective bandwidth and gain of the polarization attraction process . from eq.([3 ] ) one obtains the two polarization components of the pump amplitude as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the input pump amplitudes in the fiber and @xmath64 is the conserved total pump power .",
    "labels @xmath65 in eqs.([3]-[5 ] ) indicate the four different fwm processes leading to sideband gain through the conversion of two pump photons in two sidebands photons .",
    "for vanishing pmd ( manakov limit ) @xmath66 , @xmath67 : peak sideband gain is obtained at a frequency detuning @xmath68 such that the dispersive mismatch is compensated by the pump - induced nonlinear phase shift , i.e. , @xmath69 . in the absence of higher - order dispersion",

    "one has @xmath71 , so that the fwm terms are effectively suppressed . yet , approaching the diffusion limit is equivalent to reducing the effective pump power to zero , which correspondingly leads to a peak gain for @xmath72 .",

    "let us briefly discuss the role of the different physical parameters in determining the sideband gain and its bandwidth .",
    "first of all , increasing the birefringence strength @xmath104 or the fiber length @xmath52 reduces the peak gain coefficient as well as the optimal sideband detuning . in order to study the polarization properties of the sidebands we need to consider the eigenvectors of @xmath97 . for any frequency detuning @xmath95 within the gain band ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath105 the eigenvector of @xmath97 which grows as @xmath106 .",
    "after a relatively short distance into the fiber , we may well approximate the sideband fields as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the projection or scalar product ( which we suppose nonzero for simplicity ) of the input sidebands polarization vector @xmath109 on @xmath105 .",

    "+ in practice , since for a given sideband frequency detuning the effective gain coefficient @xmath98 decreases as the fiber length @xmath52 grows larger , the corresponding strength of polarization attraction will be reduced whenever the fiber length approaches @xmath53 . as a matter of fact , in the diffusion limit",
    "@xmath117 and fwm - induced polarization attraction is no longer observed . in the next section",
