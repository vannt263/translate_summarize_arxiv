    "a number of recent perspectives @xcite have highlighted new experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works exploring the interplay between the multiple order parameters which characterize the ground state of some of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "good evidence was obtained for a strong coupling between the superconducting order and density wave order in spin / charge / bond correlations ( described more precisely below ) . in particular , by tuning the superconducting order by an applied magnetic field at very low temperatures ( @xmath0 ) , a strong field - dependent variation was observed in the latter correlations .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of observing related connections in the finite temperature ` pseudogap ' region above the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath1 . here , the superconducting order has strong @xmath0 dependent fluctuations ; we will compute these fluctuations in the framework of a two - dimensional ginzburg - landau theory , including a precise characterization of strong fluctuations obtained from numerical studies .",
    "we will show that the model of ref .",
    "predicts that such fluctuations lead to a corresponding sympathetic variation in the autocorrelations of the other orders .",
    "working to linear order in the coupling between superconductivity and these orders , we provide a computation of certain universal characteristics of the @xmath0 dependence of the latter fluctuations .",
    "our results will also be formally extended to @xmath2 for completeness , but it must be noted that we neglect the inter - layer coupling and quantum effects , which become important at lower @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we begin by defining the order parameters under consideration .",
    "the primary order is the complex superconducting order @xmath3 which describes the spatial variation in the order associated with condensation of cooper pairs .",
    "this is expected to undergo strong ` phase ' fluctuations @xcite for @xmath0 near @xmath1 . using the proximity of the underdoped cuprates to a superfluid - insulator quantum transition , refs .",
    "argued that ` amplitude ' fluctuations should be treated at an equal footing @xcite , and proposed that such thermal fluctuations could be described by a classical partition function of a suitable universal continuum limit of the ginzburg - landau free energy : this will be reviewed here in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "such an approach describes the crossover from gaussian superconducting fluctuations at temperatures well above @xmath1 , to the vortex physics of the kosterlitz - thouless transition near @xmath1 . a dynamic theory with a similar static component ( although with a lattice cutoff ) was recently used @xcite to describe the notable measurements @xcite of the nernst effect .",
    "this fluctuating superconductor is also expected to have appreciable correlations in other order parameters .",
    "the spin - density - wave order is described by the complex 3-component vectors @xmath4 , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 extends over the 3 spin directions , and the spin operator on site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",

    "we can define bond order parameters @xmath16 by examining the modulations in the exchange energy of a pair of spins separated by a distance @xmath17 : @xmath18 . \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the special case @xmath19 of @xmath20 is a measure of the charge density wave order .",
    "comparison between ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq1 ] ) suggests that the ordering wavevectors are related by @xmath21 , and this is observed experimentally .    a number of other order parameters which are invariant under spin rotations , like @xmath20 , can also be defined @xcite .",
    "these include the site charge density , the average electron kinetic energy in a bond , or modulations in the pairing amplitude . by symmetry",
    ", all such quantities will have modulations at the wavevectors @xmath22 , and we can therefore expect that their order parameter fluctuations will track those of @xmath20 .",
    "differences in microscopic physics can , of course , make some of these modulations much larger than others .",
    "we will not explicitly consider all such possibilities here , and the reader should view @xmath20 as a suitable representative of the order parameters characterizing modulations at the wavevectors @xmath22 in observables invariant under spin rotations .",
    "we will subsequently refer to the order represented by @xmath23 simply as charge order .",
    "while the focus of this paper is on the interplay between the superconducting fluctuations and the orders mentioned above , it should be clear to the reader that our considerations are quite general .",
    "simple extensions lead to similar effects in the interplay of superconductivity with most of the other orders in the zoo of possibilities considered in the theory of the cuprates .    in considering correlations of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 in the fluctuation region ,",
    "it is important to consider the influence of random static impurities which are invariably present in the cuprates . as almost all impurities",
    "preserve electron number and spin rotation invariance , their influence on @xmath24 and @xmath25 will consist of perturbations in the _ random exchange _ class ( this is discussed more explicitly in section  [ sec : corr ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the order @xmath23 breaks only lattice symmetries , and is consequently subject to the far more disruptive _ random field _",
    "perturbations @xcite .",
    "in two spatial dimensions , this implies that true long - range order can not develop as @xmath26 , and that the @xmath23 correlation length saturates at a finite value .",
    "we will assume here that there is a local onset of @xmath23 , @xmath25 , and @xmath24 orders at temperatures where the pseudogap develops , but at lower temperatures @xmath23 correlations are predominantly controlled by the random - field disorder , and have only a weak , intrinsic @xmath0 dependence .",
    "this is also consonant with the result that thermal fluctuations are irrelevant at the random - field transition in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fluctuations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are strongly @xmath0 dependent , and can have an infinite correlation length as @xmath27 . the @xmath24 order becomes quasi - long - ranged at @xmath28 and has the strongly @xmath0-dependent gaussian - to - vortex crossover noted above at @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath25 order can also have the exponential rapid @xmath0 dependence associated with the breaking of o(3 ) spin rotation symmetry as @xmath26 .",
    "this paper will consider the regime above @xmath1 where @xmath30 the non - zero value @xmath31 is due to the presence of random - field perturbations which explicitly break lattice symmetries , and so allow @xmath23 to locally have a non - zero mean value which will fluctuate randomly as a function of @xmath7 . as noted above , we assume that @xmath31 only has a weak intrinsic @xmath0 dependence . however , the fluctuations of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 orders are not independent , and so the strong @xmath0 dependence associated with the gaussian - to - vortex crossover in @xmath24 will induce a corresponding @xmath0-dependent variation in @xmath31 .",
    "this paper will compute this variation and suggest associated experimental tests . strictly speaking , because there is only quasi - long - range order in @xmath24 below @xmath1 , the expectation values ( [ eq3 ] ) apply also for @xmath32 : indeed , our methods and results extend also to @xmath32 .",
    "however , as noted earlier , we neglect the effects of inter - layer couplings and of quantum fluctuations , and so our low @xmath0 results should be treated with caution .",
    "our theory for the fluctuating orders and their interplay is summarized in section  [ sec : corr ] , which also contains are main results .",
    "details of the continuum theory of the superconducting fluctuations and its gaussian - to - vortex crossover appear in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] discusses experimental tests and possible extensions of our theory .",
    "this section will introduce the free energies which control the fluctuations of the order parameters , and state our main results on the @xmath0 dependence of the @xmath23 order at @xmath29 .",
    "we describe the fluctuations of the superconducting order @xmath33 by a classical continuum partition function over the ginzburg - landau free energy @xcite",
    "@xmath34 \\label{gl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use here the notation of refs  : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are parameters which can be computed , in principle , from the microscopic physics of the underlying electrons .",
    "the co - efficient of @xmath38 , @xmath36 , vanishes at a mean - field transition temperature , @xmath39 , which will be distinct from the temperature @xmath1 at which there is a kosterlitz - thouless transition _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath40 . the purely two - dimensional , and classical theory ( [ gl ] )",
    "is expected to apply to the cuprates only for @xmath29 : below @xmath1 we have to also account for three - dimensional effects arising from inter - layer couplings , and for quantum effects at low enough @xmath0 .",
    "all such effects will be neglected here , but for completeness , we will nevertheless discuss properties of the theory ( [ gl ] ) over the full range of @xmath0 values .",
    "an important point is that the functional integral in ( [ gl ] ) is not defined on its own , and needs an ultraviolet regulator . in the physical system",
    "this is provided by the underlying electron physics on the lattice , but this is very difficult to characterize explicitly . here , we shall follow the procedure proposed in ref .  : the ultraviolet dependence can be accounted for by a suitable renormalization in the value of @xmath36 . however , because we do not know the explicit form of the ultraviolet cutoff , we can not _ a priori _ compute the needed shift in @xmath36 . this lack of knowledge",
    "can be circumvented by using the experimental value of @xmath1 as an input into our calculation .",
    "the knowledge of the actual @xmath1 , combined with the parameters in ( [ gl ] ) then allows a quantitative computation of the gaussian - to - vortex crossover with no free parameters .",
    "we re - iterate that ( [ gl ] ) can not be regarded as a fully predictive theory on its own , and so can not , even in principle , predict the actual value of @xmath1 : once @xmath1 is determined by other means , precise quantitative predictions for other observables become possible .    the gaussian - to - vortex crossover can be expressed in terms of the following dimensionless parameter @xmath41 . \\label{defg}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath42 should be a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 . for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , at @xmath28 , we have @xmath45 , and above @xmath1 , @xmath42 takes positive values .",
    "we will see later that the present continuum theory eventually breaks down at large @xmath0 , when @xmath42 begins to acquire a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath46 is a measure of the strength of corrections to the mean field theory of @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath36 in ( [ gl ] ) and ( [ defg ] ) is non - universal , and this will lead to some non - universality in the @xmath0 dependence of all our predictions .",
    "however , one of our main points is that there is a universal dependence on the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , once we assume a linear @xmath0 dependence of @xmath36 near @xmath1 ( as is commonly done , and we will do in ( [ mh ] ) ) , the @xmath0 dependence of our predictions becomes specific .",
    "aided by the results of ref .",
    "we will show that it is possible to obtain precise predictions for a variety of correlators of @xmath47 .",
    "we quote a result which will be useful in our analysis here of multiple order parameters : @xmath48 = \\mathcal{d}(g , t / t_c ) \\label{asymp1}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a universal function .",
    "the averages on the left - hand - side are evaluated under the partition function @xmath47 at the indicated temperature .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : sim ] that it is possible to re - express the two argument function @xmath50 in terms of a single argument function @xmath51 as in ( [ final ] ) , where @xmath52 depends upon @xmath42 and @xmath53 as in ( [ defgg ] ) . here",

    "these constants , and the constants appearing in the arguments of all subsequent logarithms , depend on only two universal numbers that have to be determined by computer simulations : the latter numbers are the constant @xmath56 computed first in ref .  , and the constant @xmath57 computed in refs .",
    ". additional higher order terms in ( [ asymp2 ] ) have also been computed and these will be presented in section  [ sec : sim ] : we show there that it is possible to account for _ all _ logarithmic terms that appear at higher orders in @xmath42 .",
    "numerical results for the full range of values of @xmath42 appear in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "the expression ( [ asymp1 ] ) has ignored the possible @xmath0-dependencies of @xmath35 and @xmath37 for simplicity : it is possible to account for these in a similar manner , as will become clear from the discussion in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "it is worth noting here that vortices are already present in the gaussian theory , associated with zeros of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the result ( [ asymp2 ] ) accounts for the initial correlations between these vortices , but does not include the vortex - binding physics of the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the latter is only accounted for by the numerical results in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "finally , as promised , let us consider the influence of the @xmath24 fluctuations described by @xmath47 on the charge order correlations .",
    "the simplest coupling between the orders is a @xmath64 term , and , as in ref .",

    "this theory maps onto ( [ gl ] ) with the following correspondences : @xmath74    it was argued @xcite that the continuum limit of @xmath75 required only the single renormalization of @xmath76 to @xmath77 : @xmath78 here we have introduced an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath79 which is needed to regulate the theory @xmath75 .",
    "the renormalization in ( [ defr ] ) is associated with logarithmic ultraviolet divergence of the one - loop ` tadpole ' diagram ; the renormalized @xmath77 in the propagator on the right - hand - side accounts for tadpoles - on - tadpoles etc .",
    "all other diagrams are ultraviolet convergent , and hence the simple structure of the renormalization theory .",
    "it is important to note that ( [ defr ] ) is the exact definition of @xmath77 , and consequently @xmath77 is _ not _ the fully ` self - energy ' of the @xmath73 field at zero external momentum ; @xmath77 only accounts for the resummation of tadpole graphs . in practice , the relationship ( [ defr ] ) implies that , when we perform a feynman graph expansion of any observable , we can ignore all tadpole graphs , and replace @xmath76 by @xmath77 in all propagators .",
    "notice also that as the bare coupling @xmath76 extends from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , the renormalized coupling @xmath77 extends from 0 to @xmath81 .",
    "after the renormalization of @xmath76 to @xmath77 , all subsequent correlators of @xmath75 are ultra - violet convergent , and so we can safely take @xmath82 in them .",
    "this implies that all these correlators are universal functions of the single dimensionless quantity that can be obtained from the parameters in ( [ fphi ] ) : this is the analog of the ` ginzburg ratio ' , defined here as @xmath83 for @xmath43 , where @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 .",

    "we conclude this paper by discussing some of the experimental and broader implications of our work .    our primary result ( [ eq10 ] ) for the coherence length of the charge order can be tested against neutron scattering and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments .",
    "however , the strong random field disorder may make @xmath63 inaccessible to a neutron probe which averages over the entire sample .",
    "in contrast , sts provides a local probe , and so may be more sensitive to the effects discussed here .",
    "consider an sts experiment with a field of view of area @xmath136 , such as those performed in refs .  .",
    "quasiparticle interference contributions , such as those computed in ref .  , appear at low temperatures , but we can expect that these will significantly broaden at temperartures above @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore focus here only on the contribution of the @xmath23 fluctuations , which also lead to modulations in the local density of the states measured in sts , as shown in ref .  .",
    "we know that the sts measurements are in the linear response regime .",

    "in this situation we have a seemingly counterintuitive effect : as @xmath0 is increased through @xmath1 , the amplitude of the charge order is enhanced .",
    "the physical origin of this is not difficult to understand : the increase in phase coherence as @xmath0 is lowered is associated with an enhanced coherent motion of the cooper pairs , and this leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the spatial modulations @xcite .",
    "an alternative statement of the same physics can be made in terms of the vortices . as we argued in ref .  , vortices nucleate static charge order , and this was proposed as an explanation of the experiments of ref .",
    "( other approaches@xcite have proposed static spin order in the vortices  in our theory , static spin order is not nucleated by vortices and appears only in phases with global magnetic order @xcite ) . increasing @xmath0 above @xmath1 causes a proliferation of vortices , and hence an enhancement of charge order .",
    "while our discussion in this paper has been entirely at the level of the landau theory of multiple order parameters , it is important to keep in mind that such a theory is an effective model , and does not preclude other interpretations which focus directly on the electronic quasiparticles . in particular we can view the competition between charge order and superconductivity as the competition for the ordering of low energy quasiparticles near the fermi surface .",
    "so as the superconducting pairing of these quasiparticles is reduced above @xmath1 , they are more susceptible to charge ordering .    an interesting direction for future work is to combine the continuum theory of the ginzburg - landau functional presented here with the theory of time - dependent superconducting fluctuations presented in refs .",
    ": this has the prospect of placing more precise quantitative constraints on the analysis of the nernst effect experiments .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of either the small @xmath52 or large @xmath52 expansions suggests that useful analytic results may be possible .",
    "results for the fluctuation conductivity in such an approach , including corrections to the aslamazov - larkin fluctuation conductivity , have appeared recently @xcite .",
    "a similar dynamic approach can also be applied to computing the linewidths of the electronic quasiparticles in the pseudogap regime : the strong amplitude fluctuations in @xmath24 should lead to significant broadening in the electronic spectral functions measured in photoemission experiments .",

    "this appendix discusses the connection between the analysis of the dilute bose gas in refs .   and the results of ref .   and the present paper .",
    "let us make it clear at the outset that we are not advocating a dilute bose gas description of the underdoped cuprates ; rather , the finite temperature properties of the dilute bose gas are characterized by some universal numbers which appear also in the models of interest in the present paper .      for large @xmath52 , the method described in appendix c of ref .",
    "was used . to one loop order ,",
    "the result @xmath168 is easily obtained , where , as in ref .  , @xmath169 .",
    "in obtaining ( [ frd ] ) , we have to explicitly account for all tadpole graphs , and the relationship in ( 2.4 ) of ref .   between @xmath76 and @xmath170 .",
    "the large momentum behavior of the expansion about @xmath171 and @xmath98 saddle points should be the same , and this ensures that the ultraviolet divergences cancel . at two loop order , 35 feynman graphs appear ; these were evaluated as in appendix c of ref .  , and their sum was found to vanish .",
    "consequently , there is no order @xmath99 term in @xmath103 , and the result ( [ largeg ] ) follows .",
    "three - dimensional effects are also important in a narrow window of temperatures above @xmath1 , where the transition crosses over to the @xmath172 xy universality class . such effects will be neglected here .",

    "it is important to distinguish ` amplitude fluctuations ' in the superconducting order from the ` pairing gap ' of the electrons .",
    "the former measures the strength of the superconducting correlations , while the latter is an energy gap associated with the fermionic spectrum at high energies .",
    "in particular , at low @xmath0 near a superconductor - insulator transition it was argued in refs   that the amplitude fluctuations become very strong .",
    "in contrast , the gap in the electron spectrum remains finite across such a transition .",

    "however , it should be noted that the bare coherence length @xmath66 is likely to have a @xmath0 dependence which acts in the opposite direction : _",
