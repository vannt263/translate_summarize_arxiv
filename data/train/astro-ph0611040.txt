    "however , known galactic black hole xrbs have never been observed to enter a spectral state in which they simultaneously have an x - ray luminosity that is at least eddington and a power - law spectrum that is harder than @xmath3 .",
    "the xrb spectral state that perhaps most closely resembles ulxs is the short - lived steep power - law ( or very high ) state , in which @xmath4 , but @xmath5 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "ulxs therefore appear to be in a persistently high / hard state .",
    "it is unclear whether existing models for xrbs can explain a high / hard spectral state .",
    "ulxs appear to require a model with both a high @xmath6 and strong corona and/or jet .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that most of the accretion power in ulxs is not being dissipated in a standard accretion disk .",
    "this implies that we can not use the standard multi - colour disk ( mcd ) model to fit any soft spectral component that might be present .",
    "we summarize the main results of the model proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* freeland  ( 2006 ) ) and we examine further the implications of a strong , accretion - powered jet for spectral fitting of accretion disk models to soft components evident in some ulx spectra .",

    "it is based on the generalized theoretical framework of @xcite , which specifically addresses vertical angular momentum transport by a magnetic torque on the the accretion disk surface .",
    "this magnetic torque is identified as the mechanism responsible for jet / corona formation .",
    "it results in a modified radial structure of the accretion disk and hence , a modified disk spectrum , which we refer to as an outflow modified multi - colour disk ( ommcd ) .",
    "let us assume here that the total power extracted by the torque is injected into a relativistic jet and partitioned into magnetic and kinetic energies .",
    "the radiative energy flux of an accretion disk modified by a magnetized jet is @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the small-@xmath9 correction factor for a standard disk and where the jet correction factor is directly related to the magnetic torque acting on the disk surface : @xmath10 thus , the jet drains energy from the disk and modifies the radial temperature profile . as a result ,",
    "the total disk spectrum is modified in the soft x - ray bandpass for stellar - mass black holes ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* soria , kuncic & gonalves 2006 ) , this volume ) .",
    "this means that unusually soft spectral components seen in some bright ulxs may be interpreted as an accretion disk spectrum modified by a jet that is responsible for the dominant power - law spectral component .",
    "figure  [ fig : x1 ] shows the _ xmm - newton_/epic spectrum of ulx x-7 in ngc4559 .",
    "the spectrum of this bright ulx can not adequately be fitted with a single power - law model .",
    "a broken power - law plus mcd model provides an acceptable fit .",
    "the low inner disk temperature required by the mcd fit to the soft component implies a black hole mass @xmath11 .",
    "we also show in fig .  1 an almost identical spectral fit to the data using a similar broken power - law plus an ommcd model .",
    "the best fit model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : x1 ] .",
    "the ommcd parameters correspond to a @xmath12 black hole accreting at @xmath13 , but with only @xmath14 being emitted by the disk . according to this model , the bulk of the accretion power",
    "is removed from the disk and injected into a jet , which is responsible for the hard power - law spectral component .",
    "however , only a small fraction of the jet power is dissipated in the form of radiation , since jets are highly inefficient emitters .",
    "relativistic beaming is then responsible for boosting the x - ray emission to the high observed levels .",
    "we calculated the jet spectral energy distribution for two different relativistic beaming scenarios ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krding , falcke & markoff 2002 ) ) : 1 .",
    "the microblazar scenario , where the jet is pointing close to our line - of - sight and the observed emission is thus strongly beamed ; and 2 .",
    "the microquasar scenario , where the jet is directed at larger angles and hence , there is less contribution from relativistic beaming to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "we used a simple radiative transfer model to take into account the synchrotron optical depth .",
