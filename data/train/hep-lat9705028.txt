    "qcdsp ( quantum chromodynamics on digital signal processors ) is the name of the single precision , digital signal processor ( dsp ) based computer being built at columbia .",
    "dsp s are essentially general purpose microprocessors , whose design has been optimized for inexpensive floating point power .",
    "the project was begun in april , 1993 as an inexpensive way to obtain a machine that would give almost teraflop scale performance for three million dollars . in particular , for this price a machine with 16,384 processing nodes , connected as a @xmath0 four - dimensional hypercubic array with a nearest neighbor communications network , would have a peak speed of 0.8 teraflops .",
    "each processing node of qcdsp contains a 50 mflop texas instruments tms320c31 dsp , 2 mbytes of dram and a custom application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) , called the node gate array ( nga ) .",
    "the nga was designed at columbia and provides three major functionalities .",
    "first , it contains a programmable fetch - ahead memory buffer to increase the effective bandwidth of the dram for regular patterns of memory access .",
    "second , it handles dram refresh and single bit error detection and correction . its third major function is to provide a 25 or 50 mhz ( the speed is programmable ) , bit serial communication link to each of the eight nearest neighbor processoring nodes .",
    "this functionality of the nga is handled by the serial communications unit ( scu ) .",
    "a fully assembled daughter board costs about $ 120 in quantity .",
    "the initial design for qcdsp was described at lattice 93 @xcite , details of the processing nodes , nga design and features at lattice 94 @xcite and final nga design issues , the networks in qcdsp and some details of the global architecture at lattice 95 @xcite .",
    "since lattice 95 , the design for our processing nodes , motherboards , backplanes and crates has been completed and the design translated into working hardware , demonstrated at lattice 96 in the form of a working 64 processor machine . in this paper , we will describe some of the milestones in this process , give more details about the hardware architecture of the full machine and discuss our evolving software environment .",
    "most of the processing nodes described in the introduction are realized on a roughly @xmath1 `` by @xmath2 '' printed circuit board .",
    "we refer to these as daughter boards .",
    "our motherboards are roughly 14.5 `` by 20.5 '' , 10 layer printed circuit boards .",
    "a motherboard holds 63 daughter boards attached to it through simm connectors .",
    "( these daughter boards can be replaced in under a minute if one fails . )",
    "a 64th processing node , referred to as node 0 , is soldered directly to the motherboard .",
    "a motherboard contains a @xmath3 configuration of processors , with the first dimension periodic on the motherboard .",
    "eight motherboards are included in a crate and four crates are stacked into a rack .    in any numerical calculation ,",
    "all the processing nodes behave similarly .",
    "node 0 on each motherboard has capabilities that the daughter boards do not .",
    "while the daughter boards have 2 mbytes of local dram , node 0 has 8 mbytes .",
    "node 0 also has special functionality that is most apparent at boot time , during hardware testing and while doing i / o .",
    "it controls the two independent scsi buses that can be attached to a motherboard , the connections of the dsp serial network described below , access to the single prom on the motherboard and the electronics driving the off - board physics network connections .",
    "in addition to the four - dimensional nearest neighbor network described in the introduction , each motherboard has a dsp serial network @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : networks ] shows these two networks , plus an example of a scsi tree connection which links motherboards to each other and the host workstation . the scsi network allows the host workstation to communicate with node 0 on any motherboard .",
    "the dsp serial network allows node 0 on a motherboard to broadcast to all 63 daughter boards or read and write to one daughter board at a time .",
    "the scsi tree plus dsp serial network provide a reliable , relatively slow network for boot - time i / o and hardware verification .",
    "there are seven surface mounted integrated circuit chips on a daughter board ; one dsp , one nga and 5 dram chips .",
    "the nga can drive two different types of physical chips ( either 512k by 8 bit drams or 256k by 16 bit drams ) to help insulate us from changes in the available configurations of memory . from a programmer s perspective",
    ", the type of physical memory used is irrelevant .",
    "we took delivery of the first 10 samples of the gate array in late july 1995 . within a week",
    ", we had assembled 4 working daughter boards . by far",
    "the largest problem we encountered was doing the surface mount soldering on the fine pitch ( pin spacing of 0.020 \" ) nga . in march 1996",
    ", we had 131 daughter boards commercially assembled . using test software we developed ,",
    "the 10 daughter boards which had assembly problems were fixed in about 45 minutes by the assemblers .",
    "this example lends credence to the idea of having thousands of daughter boards commercially assembled with few failures .",
    "the initial sketch of a motherboard in @xcite is surprisingly similar to the final result ; surface mounting node 0 directly to the board is the one major change . during the last year",
    ", the motherboard circuitry was finalized and the resulting 10 layer printed circuit board was laid out at columbia .",
    "the first two motherboards arrived in december and were hand assembled by us . by mid - january , all the peripheral systems associated with node zero were working .",
    "the remainder of the systems were debugged by mid - march , after the arrival of enough daughter boards to fully populate the motherboard .",
    "the motherboard displayed at lattice 96 was the first one completely assembled .      during the spring and summer of 1995 ,",
    "the specification of the backplane electronics was finalized .",
    "the backplane design includes an equal - time , 50 mhz clock fanout to all the crates in the machine .",
    "this is important since nearest neighbors in the four dimensional network will generally be in different crates .",
    "an equal time reset signal is also distributed . even though the machine is self - synchronizing on nearest neighbor links , it can be useful for debugging purposes to have all processors come up from reset synchronously .",
    "another vital reason for a synchronous reset is so all nodes will agree on the correct phase for a 25 mhz signal derived from the 50 mhz clock . when the scus are running at 25 mhz , all nodes must agree on this signal .",
    "the backplane also handles the distribution of three global interrupts linking all nodes .",
    "one interrupt gives a global synchronization signal , the second a non - recoverable error signal and the third as a recoverable error signal .",
    "the backplane circuit boards were laid out and assembled by bustronics .",
    "the crates were designed and built by elma corporation , with the first single crate arriving in december 1995 .",
    "the racks of four crates are under development currently .",
    "each crate requires a separate 20 amp , 220 volt circuit and a single crate is cooled by a tray of muffin fans .",
    "the four crates that are stacked into a rack will have water - cooled heat exchangers between each crate .    for a given physical configuration of the crates , the four dimensional configuration of qcdsp",
    "is determined by external cables connected to the backplane .",
    "in particular , the cabling can produce a machine of dimension @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are integers .",
    "two and three dimensional arrays are also possible by only altering the external cabling .",
    "a rudimentary operating system was written for a 2 node machine , connected to a host sun computer through a commercial sbus dsp board .",
    "this operating system provides read , write and execute access to the prototype .",
    "it has proved very useful for code development and testing .",
    "the members of the collaboration from scri have ported much of their macro - based qcd code to this 2 node prototype , providing additional testing of the hardware .",
    "a quenched update code has been written at columbia and tested on the prototype .",
    "substantial effort has gone into this area . after assembling the first daughter boards , they were subjected to a variety of tests for reliability , correct numerical results and power consumption .",
    "concurrent with the assembly of the first two motherboards , software was written to test each system as it was completed .",
    "this software will become part of the standard boot - time hardware checking done on qcdsp .",
    "we have already mentioned the automated testing software used to check the commercial daughter board assembly .",
    "this was so successful that we are currently packaging our motherboard hardware test software into a series of diagnostic and functional tests to be run at the assemblers .",
    "after daughter boards are assembled and tested , they will be inserted into a motherboard and the entire assembly tested .",
    "we expect this will result in fully populated and competely functional boards being shipped to columbia .",
    "we have completed the most basic level of the qcdsp operating system , called the boot kernels .",
    "the boot kernels are running after machine reset and provide a robust i / o path to all nodes in qcdsp .",
    "these kernels fit into the 2k words of dsp internal memory and utilize only the dsp serial network and the scsi tree .",
    "this reliance on a minimal amount of working hardware allows us to do much hardware debugging through software .",
    "the boot kernel on node 0 includes a fully functional scsi driver as well as control features to switch data to various daughter boards .",
    "we have standardized a recursive routing protocol which can handle an arbitrary number of layers in the scsi tree .",
    "we have used the boot kernels to communicate with a second motherboard and a disk from the first motherboard .    on our host sun , we have an x - windows interface to the machine , which calls a custom scsi driver to handle i / o to qcdsp .",
    "c programs compiled with the standard texas instruments tools can be loaded and run and the contents of memory on any node of qcdsp returned to the screen .",
    "the boot kernels , coupled with the interface , provide full read , write and execute capability on any node or collection of nodes . at scri , a command line interface has also been written .",
    "the run kernels are currently being developed .",
    "they will include all the features of the boot kernels , but will be larger since dram will be available when they are started .",
    "they will allow for i / o ( such as printf ) to the host , access to the disk system , interrupt handlers for machine errors and simple access to various hardware components .",
    "the optimized versions of the staggered and wilson conjugate gradient codes written when we were designing the nga have run on single node , 2 node and 64 node physical machines . in the last year , a quenched evolution has been written at columbia .",
    "a dynamical fermion update code and gauge fixing code are under current development . in addition",
    ", the macro - based qcd code used by collaborators at scri has been ported to qcdsp .",
    "we have purchased a commercial c++ compiler specifically for the texas instruments dsp from tartan , inc .",
    "this compiler includes double precision arithmetic libraries .",
    "these will run quite slowly since the hardware is single precision , but will allow us to easily check code for stability under increased precision .",
    "we hope to develop c++ classes which will hide the parallel nature of the machine from the user",
    ". these should be useful in the parts of programs that are not floating - point intensive .",
    "in the last year we have built , or had built , a few of each hardware component of qcdsp .",
    "shortly after lattice 96 , we successfully ran physics programs on a 2 motherboard , 128 node machine . a fully populated 512 node , 25 gflop machine should be finished by the end of september .",
    "all the parts are on hand for a 2048 node , 100 gflop machine , which should be completed by the end of november . at that time",
    "we expect to begin to purchase components and have them assembled for a 400 gflop machine ( 8192 nodes ) to be completed by the spring of 1997 .",
