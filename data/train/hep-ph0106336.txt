    "the possibility that the gauge bosons of the standard model(sm ) may be sensitive to the existence of extra dimensions near the tev scale has been known for some time@xcite .",
    "however , one finds that the phenomenology of these models is particularly sensitive to the manner in which the sm fermions ( and higgs bosons ) are treated .    in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the fermions remain on the wall located at the fixed point @xmath4 and are not free to experience the extra dimensions .",
    "( here , lower - case roman indices label the co - ordinates of the additional dimensions while greek indices label our usual 4-d space - time . )",
    "however , since 5-d translational invariance is broken by the wall , the sm fermions interact with the kaluza - klein(kk ) tower excitations of the sm gauge fields in the usual trilinear manner , , @xmath5 , with the @xmath6 being some geometric factor and @xmath7 labelling the kk tower state with which the fermion is interacting .",
    "current low - energy constraints arising from , , @xmath8-pole data , the @xmath9 boson mass and @xmath10-decay generally require the mass of the lightest kk gauge boson to be rather heavy , @xmath11 tev in the case of the 5-d sm@xcite independent of whether or not the higgs fields are on the wall under the assumption that the @xmath6 are @xmath7-independent for @xmath12 .    a second possibility occurs when the sm fermions experience extra dimensions by being ` stuck ' , , localized or trapped at different specific points in a thick brane@xcite away from the conventional fixed points .",
    "it has been shown that such a scenario can explain the absence of a number of rare processes , such as proton decay , by geometrically suppressing the size of the yukawa couplings associated with the relevant higher dimensional operators without resorting to the existence of additional symmetries of any kind .",
    "in addition such a scenario may be able to explain the fermion mass hierarchy and the observed ckm mixing structure thus addressing important issues in flavor physics@xcite .",
    "the couplings of the sm fermions to the gauge kk towers are in this case dependent upon their location in the extra dimension(s ) .    a last possibility , perhaps the most democratic , requires all of the sm fields to propagate in the @xmath13 tev@xmath14 bulk@xcite , , universal extra dimensions(ued ) .",
    "in this case , there being no matter on the walls , the conservation of momentum in the extra dimensions is restored and one now obtains interactions in the 4-d lagrangian of the form @xmath15 , which for flat space metrics vanishes unless @xmath16 , as a result of the afore mentioned momentum conservation .",
    "although this momentum conservation is actually broken by orbifolding , one finds , at tree level , that kk number remains a conserved quantity .",
    "( as we will discuss below this conservation law is itself further broken at one loop order . )",
    "this implies that pairs of zero - mode fermions , which we identify with those of the sm , can not directly interact singly with any of the excited modes in the gauge boson kk towers .",
    "such a situation clearly limits any constraints arising from precision measurements since zero mode fermion fields can only interact with pairs of tower gauge boson fields . in addition , at colliders it now follows that kk states must be pair produced , thus significantly reducing the possible direct search reaches for these states .",
    "in fact , employing constraints from current experimental data , appelquist , cheng and dobrescu(acd)@xcite find that the kk states in this scenario can be as light as @xmath0 gev , much closer to current energies than the kk modes in the first case discussed above .",
    "if these states are , in fact , nearby , they will be copiously produced at the lhc , and possibly also at the tevatron , in a variety of different channels .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to estimate the production rates for pairs of these particles in various channels and to discuss their possible production signatures .",
    "this is made somewhat difficult by the apparent conservation of kk number which appears to forbid the decay of heavier excitations into lighter ones and is a point we will return to in detail below .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii we briefly discuss the particle spectrum in the ued model and the breaking of kk number to ` kk parity ' at one loop . in section iii , in an attempt to get a further handle on the compactification scale of the ued scenario , we discuss the shift in the value of @xmath1 predicted in this model . unfortunately , as we will see , no new constraints are obtained . in section",
    "iv we discuss the production mechanisms and cross sections for pairs of kk excitations of the sm fields at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "similar production mechanisms and @xmath17 and @xmath18 colliders are also briefly considered .",
    "section v discusses the possible signatures for kk pair production addressing the issue of their possible stability in light of our earlier discussions in section ii .",
    "three particular decay scenarios are considered .",
    "a discussion and our conclusions can be found in section vi .",
    "in this section we very briefly review the basic nature of the ued model .",
    "the essential idea is that all of the fields of the sm are put in the bulk and thus have kk excitations . for simplicity in what follows",
    "we will limit our discussion to the case of one extra dimension with the extension to more than one dimension being reasonably straightforward . due to @xmath19 orbifolding , which is necessary to obtain chiral zero mode fermions ,",
    "the fields can be classified as either @xmath20 even or odd : all higgs boson and 4-d gauge fields are taken as @xmath20 even whereas the 5-d components of the gauge fields ( which are not present in the unitary gauge ) must then be @xmath20 odd .",
    "taking the compactification radius to be @xmath21 the corresponding eigenfunctions are simply @xmath22 for the @xmath20 even(odd ) fields .",
    "the gluon and photon excitations have the usual kk masses , @xmath23 , while the @xmath9 and @xmath8 towers have shifted masses @xmath24^{1/2}$ ] after spontaneous symmetry breaking(ssb ) by the zero mode higgs field .",
    "although the zero mode goldstone bosons are eaten as part of the ssb mechanism , their tower states remain physical , level by level degenerate with the gauge bosons and are also @xmath20 even . in the fermion sector",
    "there is a well - known doubling of states ; every @xmath25 doublet @xmath26 or singlet @xmath27 field has a vector - like tower of states above the chiral zero mode .",
    "@xmath19 only allows for the existence of the left - handed ( right - handed ) zero mode for the @xmath26(@xmath27 ) .",
    "note that while one of the fermion kk towers , the one matching the chirality of the zero mode , is constrained to be @xmath20 even , the other must be @xmath20 odd . )",
    "note that in performing calculations one must be careful not to confuse the @xmath28 and @xmath29 fields and their corresponding right - handed partners .",
    "as will be discussed below , the zero mode higgs vev links the @xmath27 and @xmath26 states level by level and simultaneously generates the zero mode fermion masses as usual .",
    "the yukawa coupling of this interaction is completely fixed by the sm fermion mass .",
    "this cross linking of the the two towers @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be necessary in order to generate the @xmath1 of the muon in this model .    now",
    "although the kk number is conserved at the tree level it becomes apparent that it is no longer so at loop order@xcite .",
    "consider a self - energy diagram with a field that has kk number of @xmath30 entering and a zero(@xmath31 ) mode leaving the graph ; kk number conservation clearly does not forbid such an amplitude and constrains the 2 particles in the intermediate state to both have kk number @xmath7(@xmath7 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the existence of such amplitudes implies that all even and odd kk states mix separately so that the even kk excitations can clearly decay to zero modes while odd kk states can now decay down to the kk number=1 state .",
    "thus it is kk _ parity _ , @xmath33 , which remains conserved while kk number itself is broken at one loop . since the lightest kk excited states with @xmath31 have odd kk parity they remain stable unless new physics is introduced .",
    "as we are only concerned with the production of pairs of the lightest kk particles in our discussion below , we are faced with the possibility of producing heavy stable states at colliders .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail further below .",
    "the bound on @xmath34 obtained by acd in this model is quite low and is not improved by the consideration of other processes such as @xmath35 as discussed by agashe , deshpande and wu@xcite . to see",
    "if we can improve this bound on @xmath34 , we briefly discuss the contribution to @xmath1 in the ued model ; we follow the analysis as given in@xcite . to this end",
    "we consider the specific situation where we have two fermions in the bulk , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , corresponding to the 5-dimensional muon fields , having the quantum numbers of an @xmath25 doublet and singlet with weak hypercharges @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "( we will drop the @xmath10 index on these fields in what follows as it is clearly understood what fields we are discussing . ) the interactions of these fermions with the gauge fields can be described by the action , @xmath40 , \\label{sfv}\\ ] ] where , @xmath41 is the vielbein , which is trivial for the flat space case we are considering , @xmath42 is a covariant derivative and @xmath43 denotes the hermitian conjugate term . note that gauge interactions do not mix the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields also interact with the bulk higgs isodoublet field , @xmath44 , , @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the compactification radius as described above and @xmath47 being a dimensionless yukawa coupling . due to the kk mechanism the fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 form separate 4-d towers of dirac fermions which , as discussed above , are degenerate level by level .",
    "these kk expansions can be written as @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the @xmath52 fields are @xmath20 even(odd ) .",
    "note that the @xmath20 orbifold symmetry and orthonormality only allows ` level - diagonal ' couplings of both types : @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 is fixed by requiring the zero mode fermion obtain a mass @xmath55 after the higgs zero mode obtains a vev , @xmath56 , and tells us the level by level coupling between the tower members .    in terms of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields ,",
    "the operator which generates the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath10 can be written as @xmath57 .",
    "this reminds us that this operator and the muon mass generating term have the same isospin and helicity structure such that a higgs interaction is required in the form of a mass insertion to connect the two otherwise decoupled zero modes .",
    "we can think of this mass insertion as the interaction of a fermion with an external higgs field that has been replaced by its vev .",
    "helicity flips play an important role in evaluating the contributions to @xmath58 since muon kk excitations are now propagating inside the loop . as is well - known , for non - chiral couplings",
    "the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a light fermion can be enhanced when a heavy fermion of mass @xmath59 participates inside the loop@xcite .",
    "there are a number of diagrams that can contribute to @xmath58 at one loop of which two are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the diagram on the left corresponds to the exchange of a tower of the 4-d neutral gauge bosons , @xmath60 and/or @xmath61 , which we will now discuss in detail . due to gauge invariance",
    "we are free to choose a particular gauge in order to simplify the calculation . here",
    ", we make use of the @xmath62 unitary gauge where the numerator of the 4-d propagator is just the negative of the flat space metric tensor@xcite . hence , in this gauge , the loops with the 4-d components of the gauge fields and the ones with the fifth component need to be considered separately .",
    "in this example , the mass insertion takes place inside the loop before the photon is emitted .",
    "clearly there are three other diagrams of this class : two with the mass insertion on an external leg and the third with the mass insertion inside the loop but after the photon is emitted .",
    "the amplitude arising from this vector exchange graph is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the corresponding couplings of the sm gauge boson to the @xmath10 in units of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here ( in the limit that we can neglect the muon mass ) @xmath67 are the masses of the @xmath26 or @xmath27 muonic kk states and @xmath68 are the corresponding masses of the kk gauge tower states , @xmath69^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath34 being the compactification scale .",
    "note that the mass insertion , @xmath55 , comes with a chirality factor that can be determined from the action @xmath70 .",
    "the amplitude where the mass insertion comes after the photon emission can be easily obtained by interchanging the ordering in the resulting final amplitude expression .",
    "what happens when the mass insertion occurs on the external legs ? with some algebra",
    "it is straightforward to show that the corresponding amplitudes obtained in these two cases are suppressed in comparison to the case of internal insertion by at least a factor of order @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a typical large kk mass . in the case of the @xmath9",
    "gauge boson tower graphs , since the @xmath9 couples only to the @xmath26 s , the mass insertion must occur on the incoming leg of the graph and the photon is then emitted from the @xmath9 ; this graph can also be shown to produce a sub - leading contribution by at least a factor of order @xmath71 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 tower graphs can be safely ignored in comparison to those arising from the @xmath8 and @xmath73 towers .",
    "( note that the suppressions that we obtain here in the case of heavy internal kk states are _ absent _ in the sm calculation of @xmath1 since the muon or its neutrino are now the internal loop fermion ) .",
    "in a similar fashion it is clear that the graphs containing goldstone bosons will also be suppressed since their couplings are of order @xmath74 .",
    "the next class of graphs is similar to the 4-d vector exchange , but in the @xmath62 gauge , now involves the fifth component of the original 5-d field . here",
    "it is important to recall that these fifth components are @xmath20 odd fields thus connecting @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "let us first consider the case where the neutral 4-d vector field is replaced by the 5-d scalar field ; in analogy with fig.1 we obtain : @xmath77 as before , the amplitude where the mass insertion comes after the photon emission can be easily obtained by interchanging the ordering in the resulting final amplitude expression .",
    "also , as before , a short analysis shows that graphs with external insertions or those involving a @xmath78 or a higgs field lead to terms which are subleading in @xmath79 or @xmath74 .",
    "we thus obtain the total contribution to @xmath1 from a given kk level of a neutral gauge boson by adding the two expressions above and performing the momentum integrations ; we find @xmath80 where we have defined @xmath81 ; note that @xmath82 in the case of photons . to go further we must sum over both the the photon and z towers ; using @xmath83 and @xmath84 we obtain the final numerical result @xmath85\\,\\ ] ] where we have neglected higher order terms in the ratio @xmath86 . for @xmath87 gev , the smallest possible value ,",
    "this gives @xmath88 which is only one quarter as large as the sm electroweak contribution .",
    "this is too small to make much of an impact on the potential difference between the experimental data and the sm prediction@xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath1 does not yet provide any useful constraint on the ued scenario@xcite .",
    "due to the conservation of kk number at tree - level , kk excitations of the sm fields must be pair - produced at colliders . at @xmath18 and",
    "lepton colliders the production cross sections for all the kinematically accessible kk states will very roughly be of order 100 fb @xmath89 which yields respectable event rates for luminosities in the @xmath90 range .",
    "a sample of relevant cross sections at both @xmath91 and @xmath17 colliders are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the case of @xmath18 collisions",
    "we have chosen the process @xmath92 as it the process which has the largest cross section for the production of the first kk state .",
    "similarly , gauge boson pair production in @xmath17 collisions naturally leads to a large cross section .",
    "clearly , such states once produced would not be easily missed for masses up to close the kinematic limit of the machine independently of how they decayed or if they were stable . to directly probe heavier masses",
    "we must turn to hadron colliders .    since both qcd and electroweak exchanges can lead to kk pair production at hadron colliders",
    "there are three classes of basic processes to consider .",
    "clearly the states with color quantum numbers will have the largest cross sections at hadron machines and there are a number of processes which can contribute to their production at order @xmath93@xcite several of which we list below : @xmath94 where the primes are present to denote flavor differences .",
    "3 shows the cross sections for these five processes at both the @xmath95 tev tevatron and the lhc summed over flavors .",
    "it is clear that the during the tevatron run ii we should expect a reasonable yield of these kk particles for masses below @xmath96 gev if integrated luminosities in the range of 10 - 20 @xmath97 are obtained .",
    "other processes that we have not considered may be able to slightly increase this reach . for larger masses we must turn to the lhc where we see that significant event rates should be obtainable for kk masses up to @xmath98 tev or so for an integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath97 . as one might expect we see that the most important qcd processes for the production of kk states are different at the two colliders .",
    "the real signature of the ued scenario is that _ all _ of the sm fields have kk excitations .",
    "thus we will also want to observe the production of the sm color singlet states .",
    "of course color singlet states can also be produced with the largest cross sections being for associated production with a colored state at order @xmath99 ; these rates are of course smaller than for pairs of colored particles as can be seen in fig .  4 . here",
    "we see reasonable rates are obtained for kk masses in excess of @xmath100 tev or so .",
    "lastly , it is possible to pair produce color singlets via electroweak interactions which thus lead to cross sections of order @xmath101 . due to the large center of mass energy of the lhc",
    "these cross sections can also lead to respectable production rates for kk masses as great as @xmath102 tev as can be seen from fig .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that the lhc will have a significant search reach for both colored and non - colored kk states provided that the production signatures are reasonably distinct .",
    "this is the subject for the next section .",
    "when examining collider signatures for kk pair production in the ued there are two important questions to ask : ( @xmath103 ) are the lightest kk modes stable and ( @xmath104 ) if they are unstable what are their decay modes ? from the discussion above it is clear that without introducing any new physics the @xmath31 kk states _ are _ stable so we must consider this possibility when looking at production signatures .    in their paper",
    "acd@xcite argue that cosmological constraints possibly suggest that kk states in the tev mass range must be unstable on cosmological time scales .",
    "( of course this does not mean that they would appear unstable on the time scale of a collider experiment in which case our discussion is the same as that above . )",
    "this would require the introduction of new physics beyond that contained in the original ued model .",
    "there are several possible scenarios for such new physics . here",
    "we will discuss three possibilities in what follows , the first two of which were briefly mentioned by acd@xcite .",
    "scenario i : the tev@xmath14-scale ued model is embedded inside a thick brane in a higher @xmath105-dimensional space , with a compactification scale @xmath106 , in which gravity is allowed to propagate in a manner similar to the model of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali@xcite . since the graviton wave functions are normalized on a torus of volume @xmath107 while the kk states are normalized over @xmath108 the overlap of a kk zero mode with any even or odd kk tower state @xmath7 and a graviton will be non - zero .",
    "in a sense , the brane develops a transition form - factor analogous to that described in @xcite .",
    "this induces transitions of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 represents the graviton field and appears as missing energy in the collider detector .",
    "this means that production of a pair of kk excitations of , , quarks or gluons would appear as two jets plus missing energy in the detector ; the corresponding production of a kk excited pair of gauge bosons would appear as the pair production of the corresponding zero modes together with missing energy .",
    "we can express this form - factor simply as @xmath111 for even and odd kk states , respectively , where @xmath112 is the graviton mass .",
    "here we have assumed that the thick brane resides at @xmath4 for all @xmath113 .",
    "these integrals can be performed directly and we obtain the following expressions for the transition form - factors in the case where @xmath31 : @xmath114 with @xmath115 where @xmath116 . given these form - factors we can calculate the actual decay rate for @xmath109 , where we now must sum up the graviton towers by following the analyses in ref.@xcite ; this result should be relatively independent of the spin of the original kk state .",
    "we find the total with to be given by @xmath117 ^ 2(n=1 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the width for the decay into a graviton of mass @xmath112 , @xmath119 is the @xmath120-dimensional planck scale , @xmath121 is the conventional 4-d reduced planck scale , and @xmath72 is the mass of the relevant decaying kk state . performing the integration numerically we obtain the results shown in fig.6 .",
    "this figure shows that this mechanism provides for a very rapid decay over almost all of the parameter space . for light kk states with both @xmath122 and @xmath119 large the decay rate",
    "is suppressed and may lead to finite length charged tracks in the detector .",
    "( in particular the production of a charged kk state with a long lifetime would yield a kink - like track structure due to the decay to the graviton tower . )",
    "although not a true two - body decay , fig.6 also shows that the typical missing energy in the gravitational decay of a kk state will be close to half its mass , which is quite significant for such heavy objects .",
    "it is clear that events with such a large fraction of missing energy should be observable above background given sufficient event rates .",
    "these events will not be confused with susy signals since they occur in every possible channel .",
    "scenario ii :",
    "kk decays can be induced in the ued model by adding a ` benign ' brane at some @xmath123 which induces new interactions . by",
    "` benign ' we mean that these new interactions only do what we need them to do and do not alter the basic properties of the ued model .",
    "the simplest form of such interactions are just the four dimensional variants of the terms in the the 5-d ued action .",
    "for example , one might add a term such as @xmath124 where @xmath47 is some yukawa - like coupling and @xmath125 is some large scale .",
    "note that the brane is placed at some arbitrary position @xmath123 and _ not _ at the fixed points where only even kk modes would be effected .",
    "these new interactions result in a mixing of all kk states both even and odd and , in particular , with the zero mode .",
    "thus we end up inducing decays of the form kk@xmath126",
    "kk@xmath127 kk@xmath127 . for kk fermions the decay into a fermion plus gauge boson zero mode",
    "is found to be given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the induced mixing angle , @xmath130 is a color factor , @xmath131 , the relevant gauge coupling and ps is the phase space for the decay .",
    "it is assumed that the mixing angle is sufficiently small that single production of kk states at colliders remains highly suppressed but is large enough for the kk state to decay in the detector . for @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    "a few @xmath34 this level of suppression is quite natural .",
    "( numerically , it is clear that the kk state will decay inside the detector unless the mixing angle is very highly suppressed . )",
    "the resulting branching fractions can be found in table 1 where we see numbers that are not too different than those for excited fermions in composite models with similar decay signatures .",
    "however , unlike excited sm fields , single production modes are highly suppressed . for",
    "kk excitations of the gauge bosons , their branching fractions into zero mode fermions will be identical to those of the corresponding sm fields apart from corrections due to phase space , , the first excited @xmath8 kk state can decay to @xmath134 while the sm @xmath8 can not .",
    ".individual branching fractions in per cent for the first excited fermion kk modes when kk level mixing occurs as in scenario ii . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     scenario iii : we can add a common bulk mass term to the fermion action , , a term of the form @xmath135 ; we chose a common mass for both simplicity and to avoid potentially dangerous flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "the largest influence of this new term is to modify the zero mode fermion wavefunction which is now no longer flat and takes the form @xmath136 and thus remains @xmath20-even .",
    "clearly there is now a significant overlap in the 5-d wavefunctions between pairs of fermion zero modes and any @xmath20-even gauge kk mode which can be represented as another form - factor :    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath7 is the kk mode number .",
    "this form factor then describes the decay @xmath139 where @xmath110 represents a generic kk gauge field .",
    "similarly we can obtain a form - factor that describes the corresponding decay @xmath140 given by    @xmath141    where @xmath142 is as above .",
    "it is clear that the decays of kk states in this scenario will be essentially identical to scenario ii above although they are generated by a completely different kind of physics .",
    "7 shows the shape of these two form - factors as a function of the parameter @xmath142 .",
    "the natural question to ask at this point is ` what is the value of @xmath143 relative to @xmath34 ? ' .",
    "it seems natural to imagine that the bulk mass would be of order the compactification scale , the only natural scale in the action , which would imply that @xmath144 so that large form - factors would be obtained . while this scenario works extremely well for the decay of @xmath20-even states it does not work at all for the case of @xmath20-odd states .",
    "in this paper we have begun a detailed examination of the predictions of the universal extra dimensions model for future colliders . since it is known from the detailed analysis of appelquist , cheng and dobrescu and the subsequent work by agashe , deshpande and wu that the compactification scale , @xmath34 in this model can be as low as 350 gev , we first examined the contribution to @xmath1 in this model arising from loops of kk states .",
    "although this contribution , of order @xmath145 , may eventually be probed by the brookhaven @xmath1 experiment , no new bounds on @xmath34 are at present obtainable .",
    "next we turned to the production of the lightest kk states at lepton , @xmath18 and hadron colliders .",
    "here it was necessary to be reminded that due to tree - level conservation of kk number in the ued model it is necessary to pair - produce kk states .",
    "since indirect searches for such states give rather poor reaches direct searches are of greater importance in this model than in the other cases discussed in the introduction .",
    "thus to obtain interesting search reaches requires a hadron collider such as the tevatron or lhc . based on counting events",
    "we expect the reach st the tevatron run ii ( lhc ) for kk states to be @xmath146 gev . within the ued model itself these lightest kk states are stable even when loop corrections are included unless new interactions are introduced from elsewhere",
    ". if these states are indeed stable , the production of a large number of heavy stable charged particles would not be missed at either collider .",
    "it is more likely , however , that new physics does indeed enter rendering the kk modes unstable . in this paper",
    "we have examined three new physics scenarios that induce finite kk lifetimes and compared their decay signatures .    in the first case",
    "the ued model was embedded in a thick brane in a larger n - dimensional space in which gravity was free to propagate . due to the difference in sizes over which the various fields are normalized , excited kk states can now decay to zero mode sm fields through the emission of gravitons whose rate is controlled by a geometric form - factor like function . at colliders this would appear as the production of pairs of sm states in association with a large amount of missing energy from the two towers of gravitons . in a second scenario ,",
    "a ` benign ' brane is introduced somewhere between the fixed points on which a set of non - renormalizable interactions occur .",
    "these interactions then induce mixing amongst the various kk levels violating kk number conservation and allowing excited kk modes to decay to sm fields .",
    "the branching fractions of all of the fermionic kk states were calculated while those of the gauge kk states are found to be essentially the same as the corresponding sm fields apart from phase space effects . in the last scenario we consider the possibility that the 5-dimensional fermion fields obtain a common bulk mass ;",
    "a common bulk mass was assumed both on the basis of simplicity and to avoid any potentially dangerous fcnc .",
    "this modifies the wave - function of the zero modes so that a finite overlap exists with higher modes .",
    "this then allows the decay of kk states through another set of form - factors that arise from these wave function overlaps .",
    "unfortunately these form - factors vanish for @xmath20-odd kk excited states due to @xmath20 parity conservation and thus these states will remain stable . in this scenario",
    "the decay signatures are found to be similar to those of the previous case .",

    "<S> in the universal extra dimensions model of appelquist , cheng and dobrescu , all of the standard model fields are placed in the bulk and thus have kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations . </S>",

    "<S> after calculating the contribution to @xmath1 in this model we investigate the production cross sections and signatures for these particles at both hadron and lepton colliders . </S>",
