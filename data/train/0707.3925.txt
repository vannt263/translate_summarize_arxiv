    "schemes @xcite , also called _ modified concatenation _ schemes by fan @xcite , place a modulation encoder and decoder as outer parenthesis and a systematic ecc encoder and decoder as inner parenthesis around the storage channel .",
    "this way , the modulation decoder follows the ecc decoder , rather than precedes it , thus , avoiding error propagation by the modulation decoder at the input of the ecc decoder as in the _ standard concatenation _",
    "scheme @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bliss ] , the parity bits generated from the sequence of modulation encoded channel bits are encoded with a second modulation encoder , where both modulation encoders are of the _ run length limited _ ( rll ) type @xcite .",
    "the so called _ @xmath4-precoder _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : bliss ] performs an integration modulo-2 in order to convert _ differential bits _ , also called _",
    "@xmath5-bits _ within the context of rll coding , to so called _ unipolar bits , _ that are indicative of the type of run on the storage medium .",
    "the channel siso detector is shared between the systematic and the parity part of the ldpc codeword and produces soft - decision values for the unipolar bits .",
    "the equalizer filter shortens the channel impulse response .",
    "the siso rll decoder operates on these soft - decision unipolar bits produced by the channel siso detectors .",
    "hence , the number of states of the rll siso decoder is twice the number expected if differential bits were used , as the state incorporates an additional _ _ polarity bit _ _ gives a moderate bit error performance improvement over a channel siso that outputs soft differential bits and an rll siso that with half the number of states .",
    "even better bit error performance is possible by combining the channel siso and the rll siso in one _ joint siso _ with the product space of the state space of the channel siso and rll siso . ] .",
    "bliss schemes have pros and cons in comparison with a standard concatenation scheme :    * _ pro : _ in the bliss scheme , the bit error rate ( ber ) at the input of the ldpc decoder , at least for the dominating systematic part , is the bare ber after bit - detection , which has not been multiplied by the error propagation factor of the rll siso decoder . * _ con : _ the error correction capability of the ldpc code is characterized by its code rate @xmath6 ( and secondarily by its block length @xmath7 ) .",
    "the rll encoding of the systematic part increases the number of bits into the ecc parity generator .",
    "for instance , for the same ldpc code rate @xmath6 with a rate 2/3 rll code , as applies for the @xmath0 case , the parity generator produces 1.5 times more parity bits , due to the rll encoding of the systematic bit sequence .",
    "this additional amount of parity lowers the net rate of the bliss scheme .    in order to mitigate the rate loss of bliss schemes due to the parity generation over redundant data as mentioned above",
    ", immink @xcite introduced a compression codec in bliss scheme . for storage channels with jitter noise on the transitions between run lengths , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite reduced the error propagation of the compression decoder for a @xmath8 rll code by the use of gray labeling . in this contribution , we take a different approach .",
    "we accept the redundancy of the systematic channel bit sequence , and modify the ldpc decoder to exploit this redundancy during its decoding iterations , in order to improve its error correction performance .",
    "our interest is in the use of the same rll codes by both modulation encoders and _ low density parity check _ ( ldpc ) codes @xcite as ecc codes with a high code rate ( e.g. @xmath9 ) . especially , in near - field",
    "optical storage as envisaged for the fourth generation of optical recording , rll constraints with a minimum run length constraint of @xmath0 are still quite popular as evidenced by the recent rll code design of coene et al .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we discussed a _ stitching technique _ to connect a systematic part of a codeword to its adjacent parity part .",
    "the _ min - sum _ ldpc decoding algorithm @xcite is a simplification of the sum - product algorithm that uses _ minimum and summation _ operations instead of multiplication and summation operations .",
    "both algorithms are a special case of the message passing algorithm @xcite that passes messages along the edges of a so called factor graph .",
    "these messages convey soft - decision information , e.g. in the form of _ log - likelihood ratios _",
    "the min - sum algorithm always uses a _",
    "log - likelihood _ representation of the messages . for a binary random variable with probability @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) of taking on the value 0 ( 1 ) ,",
    "the log - likelihood equals @xmath12 . with a properly chosen scaling factor after the minimum operation , the performance loss of the min - sum algorithm w.r.t .",

    "the choice of the _ codeword bit node _ or _",
    "`` variable node '' _ degrees in the _ factor graph _ @xcite of the ldpc code seems to have only a minor influence for high ldpc code rate .",
    "let @xmath7 be the ldpc codeword length and @xmath13 be the number of parity check equations .",

    "a constant number of iterations can be used .",
    "the decoder output messages need not be evaluated for all iterations , but only for the final iteration .",

    "the output message along a certain arc from a certain node is only allowed to depend on the ( most recently ) received input messages via all _ other _ arcs into that node .",
    "hence , for @xmath0-constraint node with index @xmath21 , and most recently received log - likelihood messages @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we need to specify three output functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 in order to generate as many log - likelihood output messages @xmath71 , such that @xmath72    observe that , if one of the input log - likelihood values @xmath73 of a @xmath0-constraint node is zero , there is no indication that the @xmath0-constraint is violated , as it is not possible to conclude to a violation from the knowledge of fewer than @xmath74 hard - decision estimates .",
    "then , the output log - likelihood messages are to be zero . the output messages do not need to exert a force on the solution of the ldpc decoder in that case . on the contrary",
    ", if the input log - likelihoods have large absolute values , and their hard - decision values indicate a violation of the @xmath3-constraint , the output values , also should have large absolute values .",
    "if the hard - decision values indicate compliance with the @xmath3-constraint , the output log - likelihoods should be zero .",
    "hence , in the spirit of the min - sum algorithm we choose to let @xmath75 similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : check_node ] ) , one can use a scaling factor to post - multiply the above minimum values .",
    "also the _ sign of _",
    "@xmath76 is not allowed to depend on @xmath77 , etc .",
    "the signs are chosen such that they enforce the disappearance of violations of the @xmath0 constraint in the decoded ldpc codeword , see tables [ tab : co_0 ] , [ tab : co_1 ] and [ tab : co_2 ] . as stated before ,",
    "a zero entry in these tables applies when there is no violation of the @xmath3-constraint .",
    "with reference to the above definitions of log - likelihood messages , one iteration of the extension of the min - sum ldpc decoding algorithm with @xmath0-constraint nodes in the factor graph is given by the following equations .",
    "we experimented with two pseudo - random regular ldpc codes .",
