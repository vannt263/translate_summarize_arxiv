    "the existence of a significant component of nonbaryonic dark matter ( dm ) in the universe has been well confirmed by astrophysical observations @xcite in recent years , however the nature of this substance remains unclear .",
    "since there is no candidate for dm in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , it implies the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "probe of the microscopic identity and properties of dm has become one of the key problems in particle physics and cosmology ( for reviews of dm , see , for instance , @xcite ) .    among a large amount of theoretical models , a well - motivated candidate for dm",
    "is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "this wimp must be stable , nonrelativistic , electrically neutral , and colorless .",
    "if the mass of wimp is from a few gev to tev and the interaction strength is of the weak scale , they can naturally yield the observed relic density of dm , which is often referred to as the wimp miracle @xcite .",
    "a huge variety of new physics models trying to solve the problems of the sm at the weak scale can naturally contain wimp candidates , such as the supersymmetric models @xcite , extra dimensional models @xcite , little higgs models @xcite , left - right symmetric models @xcite , and many other theoretical scenarios .",
    "the above mentioned specific models are well - motivated , however they still lack experimental support",
    ". we do not know whether nature really behaves like one of them or some other yet unconsidered theories .",
    "moreover , in case the dm particle is the only new particle within the reach of lhc and other new particle species are much heavier than dm , it will be very difficult to tell which model the dm particle belongs to . additionally , it is possible that the dm may be first observed by direct or indirect detection experiments .",
    "these early observations may only provide information about some general properties of the dm particle , and may not be able to distinguish the underlying theories .",
    "therefore , the model - independent studies of the dm phenomenology are particularly important for they may avoid theoretical bias @xcite .",
    "recently there have been quite a few papers following such consideration and adopting a model - independent way to study various phenomenologies related with dm @xcite . especially the relic density measured by wmap @xcite , direct detection from cdms @xcite , xenon @xcite and possible collider signals from lhc are considered in these studies .    in this work ,",
    "we first construct the general effective 4-fermion interaction operators between dm particles and the sm particles , which extend the effective fermionic wimp interactions given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we focus on dirac fermionic dm .",
    "discussions on scalar and vector dm will be presented in companion papers .",
    "we then give updated constraints from the dm relic density within the 7-year wmap data @xcite and the spin - independent wimp - nucleus elastic scattering searches by cdms ii @xcite and xenon100 @xcite , and compare our results with those in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , we present new phenomenological constraints on these effective models from the spin - dependent wimp - nucleus elastic scattering searches by cdms @xcite and xenon @xcite and the cosmic - ray antiproton - to - proton ratio by pamela @xcite . we find that the constraints from different kinds of experiments are rather comparable . combination of these constraints provides more information of the effective models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] we briefly describe the effective dm models of various 4-fermion interaction operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec - relic ] , [ sec - direct ] and [ sec - indirect ] we explore the constraints on these models from the dm relic density , direct and indirect detection searches , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec - combine ] we discuss the validity region of effective theory and present the combined constraints on the effective coupling constants of these models .",
    "[ sec - con ] is the conclusion .",
    "we start with the case that dm is a single dirac fermionic wimp ( @xmath2 ) . instead of considering a wimp candidate from a specific theoretical model ,",
    "we study the phenomenologies in a model - independent way by constructing effective interaction operators between @xmath2 and the sm particles .",
    "these interaction operators are constrained only by the requirements of hermiticity , lorentz invariance and cpt invariance .    to proceed",
    ", we make the following assumptions similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) the wimp is the only new particle at the electroweak scale , and any new particle species other than the wimp has a mass much larger than the wimp .",
    "this implies that the wimp s thermal relic density is not affected by resonances or coannihilations , and this makes it possible to describe the interaction between the wimps and the standard model particles in terms of an effective field theory .",
    "( 2 ) the wimp only interacts with the standard model fermions through a 4-fermion effective interaction , but not with other particles like gauge or higgs bosons .",
    "this 4-fermion effective interaction is assumed to be dominated by only one form ( scalar , vector , etc . ) of the set of 4-fermion operators for simplicity .",
    "( 3 ) the wimp annihilation channels to the standard model fermion - antifermion pairs dominate over other possible channels .",
    "in other words , the possible channels to final states that include gauge or higgs bosons are assumed to be negligible for simplicity .",
    "however , it should be noted that the supersymmetric dm model actually can not satisfy the three assumptions above simultaneously in order to give the correct relic density .",
    "even so these assumptions are still useful for a general research .",
    "the effective lagrangian between two fermionic wimps ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and two standard model fermions ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) is given by only one of the following expressions : @xmath6 where the sum of @xmath4 is over all the standard model fermions , and the effective coupling constants @xmath7 are real numbers which have mass dimension of @xmath8 .",
    "the 4 chiral interaction operators , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are just the combinations of the other operators mentioned above . here",
    "we do not include the interaction operators involving derivative @xmath13 insertions into fermion bilinears , for they have higher momentum dimensions and may be safely ignored in the small momentum limit .",
    "note that the alternative tensor interaction term in has two other equivalent forms , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "each form of the interaction operators listed above represents an effective model of the wimp coupled to the standard model fermions . for each case",
    ", we can calculate the corresponding annihilation and scattering cross sections , which depend on the wimp mass @xmath15 and the coupling constants @xmath16 .",
    "associated with the recent results of the dm relic density , direct and indirect detection experiments , we can obtain the phenomenological constraints on @xmath16 . it would be interesting and meaningful to compare the constraints derived from different experiments .",
    "it is worthwhile to note the symmetry properties of these operators under discrete c , p , and t transformations .",
    "the first 5 forms of the operators , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are separately invariant under c , p , and t , while the transformation properties of the other operators are summarized in table [ table - trans - cpt ] .",
    "the transformation properties of the operators under cp are the same as those under t , given that the coupling constants @xmath7 are real - valued numbers .",
    "thus , all the operators are actually cpt invariant .",
    "if the future experiments indicate that there were some of the c , p , and t symmetries in the dm sector , we may use this table to concentrate on or exclude some interaction operators .",
    ".the transformation properties of the 4-fermion operators under c , p , and t. since @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are separately invariant under c , p , and t , they are not listed below .",
    "the plus @xmath22 means being invariant under the transformation , while the minus @xmath23 means sign reversal .",

    "this comes from the fact that @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are of order @xmath75 ; although the leading term of @xmath101 is of order @xmath76 , it is smaller by a factor of @xmath102 than the @xmath76 terms for other types of interactions . * in the case of @xmath103 , there is an obvious downward bend in the curve of @xmath16 vs. @xmath15 at about @xmath104  gev in each effective model .",

    "@xcite , we observe that the curves in the first 6 frames of fig .  [",

    "in this section we discuss the direct detection constraints on the effective models of eqs.. direct detection experiments are designed to measure the recoil energy of the atomic nuclei when the wimps elastically scatter off them .",
    "the wimp - quark interactions in the effective models naturally induce the wimp - nucleon interactions , and the latter further induce the wimp - nucleus interactions .",
    "such interactions may lead to the elastic scattering of the wimps with the nuclei , which may be detected at the direct detection experiments .",
    "the velocity of the wimp near the earth is thought to be of the same order as the orbital velocity of the sun , @xmath114 .",
    "because of this small velocity , the momentum transfer in the wimp - nucleus scattering is considerably small compared to the masses of the wimp and the nuclei .",

    "this is because in the zero momentum transfer limit some fermion bilinear operators become zero , for example , the operator @xmath120 vanishes , and the time component of @xmath121 and the space components of @xmath122 vanish as well . for more details on this issue ,",
    "@xcite .    among the remaining operators relevant to direct detection , the scalar and vector interaction operators , @xmath17 and @xmath19 ,",
    "are referred to as spin - independent ( si ) interactions , while the axialvector and tensor interaction , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , belong to spin - dependent ( sd ) interactions . and the chiral interaction operators are the combinations of si and sd interactions .",
    "the si interactions of all the nucleons add coherently in the target nucleus , and the corresponding wimp - nucleus cross section is proportional to the square of the atomic mass number of the nucleus .",
    "on the other hand , since the spins of nucleons in a nucleus tend to cancel in pairs , the sd interactions rely mainly on the spin content of one unpaired nucleon and the corresponding cross section is not enhanced for heavy nuclei .",

    "the difference of the curves for a and av is somewhat like the difference of the cases of universal couplings and yukawa - like couplings ( @xmath103 ) for the same effective interaction .",

    "<S> in this work we study the constraints on the dark matter interaction with the standard model particles , from the observations of dark matter relic density , the direct detection experiments of cdms and xenon , and the indirect detection of the @xmath0 ratio by pamela . a model independent way is adopted in the study by constructing the effective interaction operators between dark matter and standard model particles . </S>",
    "<S> the most general 4-fermion operators are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the constraints from different observations are complementary with each other . </S>",
    "<S> especially the spin independent scattering gives very strong constraints for corresponding operators . in some cases the indirect detection of @xmath0 data </S>",
    "<S> can actually be more sensitive than the direct detection or relic density for light dark matter ( @xmath1 gev ) . </S>"
