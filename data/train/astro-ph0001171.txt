    "recent high - resolution near - infrared imaging reveals a tight cluster of at least a dozen stellar sources projected within 05 of the putative massive black hole in the galactic center ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ; ghez et al .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest that this cluster contains early - type stars with initial masses @xmath815 to 20 . while their low - resolution spectra ( r @xmath0 35 ) and photometry can be fit by early - type stars , they can also be fit by much lower mass k giants of a few .",
    "the implications for star formation near a massive black hole are heavily dependent on whether the stars are of early or late type . in the former case ,",
    "the stars are a few  old and probably formed very near to the central black hole . in the latter case , they are on the order of a  old and represent a central concentration of the general old population seen throughout the galactic center ( alexander 1999 ) . if stars have formed near the central black hole , then it is important to know the physical properties of the gas there .",
    "the intensity of recombination line emission can be used to constrain the gas density and ionizing environment near the center , and the line width might be used to probe the central mass to smaller size scales than the stellar velocity dispersions .    with these issues in mind , we obtained high resolution ( r @xmath8 22,400 ) and moderate resolution ( r @xmath8 2,700 ) long - slit spectra of the central few arcseconds of the galaxy in the 2.0@xmath12.4  region ( _ k_-band ) .",
    "we present spectra of the combined light from the central stellar sources ( hereafter the `` s sources '' ; genzel et al .",
    "1997 ) , nearby stars , and ionized gas .",
    "the observations were obtained with nirspec , the facility near - infrared spectrometer , on the keck ii telescope ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "a log of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the plate scale was measured by comparing the locations of the spectra of irs7 , irs16nw , irs33e , and irs33w to the positions in eckart & genzel ( 1997 ) , giving 014@xmath9020 per pixel in the spectral@xmath9spatial directions of the high - resolution mode , and 020@xmath9014 per pixel in the spectral@xmath9spatial directions of the low - resolution mode ( note that the axes are flipped with respect to the camera in the two modes ) .",
    "the slit viewing camera ( scam ) was used to obtain images simultaneously with the spectra .",
    "we measured a plate scale for the scam of 018 per pixel by comparing the locations of irs16nw , irs16ne , irs33e , and irs33w to those given by eckart & genzel ( 1997 ) . from scam images",
    ", we estimate seeing ( fwhm ) of 0@xmath105 on 28 april 1999 and 0@xmath103 on 3 june 1999 . we chose to use the 3-pixel - wide slit ( 043 ) in high - resolution mode and the 2-pixel - wide slit ( 039 ) in low - resolution mode in order to match the seeing .",
    "quintuplet star # 3 , which is featureless in this spectral region ( see figure 1 in figer et al .",
    "1998 ) , was observed as a telluric standard ( nomenclature from moneti , glass , & moorwood 1994 ) .",
    "arc lamps containing ar , ne , kr , and xe , were observed to set the wavelength scale .",
    "a field relatively devoid of stars ( ra  17@xmath11  44@xmath12  49@xmath138 , dec  @xmath128@xmath14  54@xmath15  6@xmath108  ,",
    "j2000 ) was observed to provide a dark current plus bias plus background image .",
    "a quartz tungsten halogen lamp was observed to provide a `` flat '' image .",
    "all data reduction was accomplished using iraf routines .",
    "bad pixel removal , flat - fielding , and coadding of object - sky frame pairs were performed to produce the final spectral images .",
    "the spectra were extracted and then divided by a similarly extracted spectrum of the telluric standard corrected for its apparent spectral energy distribution ( figer et al .",
    "we have compared the flux in the spectrum to that expected from the stars in the slit ( wizinowich et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the detected flux in the low - resolution spectrum confirms our pointing . the total background - subtracted flux from the combined low - resolution spectrum is  = 12.8 , in good agreement with the sum of the previously reported fluxes for the sources , reported as  = 12.6 ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the low resolution spectra for the s sources , irs7 , and irs16nw .",
    "the spectra demonstrate the very deep co absorption in the spectrum of a cool star ( irs7 ) and the total lack of any similar feature in that of a hot star ( irs16nw ) .",
    "the spectra for the s sources were extracted from synthetic apertures centered 138 south of irs16nw and 075 wide to give w@xmath2  @xmath0  6@xmath162   .",
    "figure 2 shows that the co bandhead strength gradually increases in apertures to the south of sgr  a@xmath6 , and to the north of irs16nw .",
    "for instance , w@xmath2  @xmath0  11@xmath162    for an aperture centered 078 to the south of sgr  a@xmath6 . a similar measurement for @xmath17 cep ( k0iii )",
    ", whose spectrum was taken from the kleinmann & hall atlas ( 1986 ) , gives w@xmath2  =  11.5  ; note that later red giants would have deeper co absorption .",
    "it appears , then , that the off - source spectrum is similar to that of a k giant .",
    "the total on - source continuum flux level ( with background ) is about 1.8 times the off - source flux level .",
    "so , if the collective spectrum for the s sources is truly featureless , and the spectrum of the background mimics that of a k giant , then we would expect to measure an equivalent width of 6    in the combined spectrum , in good agreement with our measurements .",
    "we find that no more than 30% of the light in the composite spectrum can come from k giants or later types .",
    "note that this limit is conservatively determined by using the upper error limit of w@xmath2  =  8   , for the combined light spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the light from all sources in the central 039 @xmath9 085 ( ew @xmath9 ns ) suggests at least some population of stars earlier than k0 , and we find that the nearest blue supergiant , irs16nw , does not contribute significantly to the light falling in the aperture .",
    "the peak of the s sources is 143 south of irs16nw , and the point spread function ( measured from irs7 ) suggests that the light from irs16nw should contribute @xmath3 1% of the total flux in the synthetic aperture .",
    "we are also interested in detecting possible emission - line flux from the stellar sources , in order to constrain their nature , and from any gas associated with the black hole , in order to constrain the physical properties of material near the black hole .",
    "the high resolution data are particularly useful for this purpose ( see table 1 and figure 3 ) .",
    "we find three distinct components to the br-@xmath7 emission : 1 ) a faint `` zero - velocity '' component which is distributed throughout the low - resolution slit region , and is not easily identified in figure 3 , 2 ) a very bright , high - velocity , component associated with the `` mini - spiral , '' and 3 ) a near - zero - velocity component near the position of sgr  a@xmath6 and extending 15 to the north and 7  to the south .",
    "the first component can also be seen in the h@xmath18 ( 2.122 ) and ( 2.058 ) lines , suggesting that and gas are distributed in projection over the whole region , and are being ionized by the ambient radiation field .",
    "the third component varies considerably along the north - south direction in peak location , 0 @xmath19 v@xmath20 @xmath19 + 55 , and line width , 25  @xmath19  v@xmath5  @xmath19  110  , gradually increasing from south to north . at the position of sgr",
    "a@xmath6 , the emission is centered at v@xmath20  =  + 15  , and v@xmath5  =  80  at the peak emission .",
    "within 2  of sgr  a@xmath6 , the line center has a linear gradient of @xmath2118  arcsec@xmath22 ( south - to - north ) , and the line width has a peak value of + 90  at @xmath106 south of sgr  a@xmath6 .",
    "the only distinguishing characteristic of the emission at the location of sgr  a@xmath6 with respect to surrounding regions is the local maximum in the line width which is 50% greater than the value @xmath0  1  in either direction .",
    "the otherwise nondescript appearance of the line emission near sgr  a@xmath6 suggests that it has little to do with the black hole .",
    "forbidden iron - line emission can also be seen throughout the spectroscopic field .",
    "there appears to be a broad [ ] emission line near 2.2178   with v@xmath5 @xmath0 1,000 , peaking near the center of the spectroscopic field shown in figure 2 ; a similar broad feature is not seen in the br-@xmath7 line .",
    "there is also a velocity component of the [ ] emission lines at 2.1451 , 2.2178 , 2.2420 , and 2.3479  which is narrow and follows the pattern of the mini - cavity , the spatial distribution of which agrees well that described in lutz , krabbe , & genzel ( 1993 ) .",
    "the s sources span a range of brightness of 14.0  @xmath23  @xmath23  16.0 , implying a range of absolute magnitudes of @xmath13.2  @xmath23  m@xmath24  @xmath23  @xmath11.1 , assuming d=8000 pc ( reid 1993 ) and  @xmath0 2.7 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes match those of o9v to b1v stars having 25  @xmath25  @xmath25  10  , and 6  @xmath3  @xmath4  @xmath3  20   ( assuming the geneva models , twice mass loss rate , twice solar metallicity , and @xmath4  @xmath81  old ; meynet et al .",
    "the absolute magnitudes can also be fit by red giants of type k0iii to k3iii with ages @xmath0  1  .",
    "the early - type stars are most easily distinguished from the red giants by the presence of co absorption in the -band spectra of the latter .",
    "for instance , the deepest co bandhead in the -band ( 2.2935 ) for an early k giant has w@xmath2  @xmath0  11   .",
    "the data suggest that the majority of the s sources in our synthetic aperture are hot stars formed within 0.1 pc of the black hole .",
    "this is in agreement with genzel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and eckart , ott , & genzel ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the observed stars are actually red giants minus their outer envelopes , such as might be produced via stellar collisions ( lacy , townes , & hollenbach 1982 ; bailey & davies 1999 ) .",
    "even a particularly luminous red giant ( _ l _  @xmath0  10@xmath26  ) with its envelope stripped to an extent consistent with the lack of strong br-@xmath7 absorption would have  @xmath25  16 , far too faint to be a likely candidate for the s sources .",
    "it is also unlikely that they have formed outside of the center and have been transported inward via dynamical friction . using figure 1 and equation 1 in morris ( 1993 )",
    ", we find that it would take longer than the lifetime of an o- or b - star to transport them into the center if they were formed more than 0.1 pc from the center .    the requirements for star formation so near the supermassive black hole are extreme .",
    "consider a protostellar clump of sufficient density to form an o - star near the black hole .",
    "such a clump would need to be very dense to be bound against tidal disruption : @xmath27 where _",
    "r@xmath28 _ is the distance between the clump and the galactic center , and _",
    "m _ is the enclosed mass within the orbit of the clump .",
    "let s assume that the clump is as far away from the center as possible while still allowing for dynamical friction to operate as described above , i.e. , _ r@xmath28 _",
    "@xmath0  0.1  pc . with m",
    "=  2.6(10@xmath29 )  , we find , n@xmath30  @xmath31  4(10@xmath32 )  @xmath33 . since gas near",
    "the gc is presently at least 5 orders of magnitude less dense than this , one must appeal to a much denser environment during the formation epoch , or to an event which was exceptionally strongly compressive , or to both .",
    "as discussed by morris , ghez & becklin ( 1999 ) , the formation of stars this close to the supermassive black hole would inevitably be accompanied by the violent release of accretion energy with a total luminosity near the eddington limit of the black hole , since the black hole would then be immersed in a relatively dense medium .",
    "indeed , this outpouring of energy may be required to compress the gas to densities sufficient to overcome the tidal forces . given the challenge of forming stars in this tidally extreme environment , other possibilities might be considered .",
    "for example , have the masses of these stars been built up by stellar coalescence or by continuous accretion , making them much older than we infer ?",
    "the calculations of lee ( 1996 ) suggest that this is unlikely , although bonnell , bate , & zinnecker ( 1998 ) argue that all stars with  @xmath25  10  form by coalescence in very young dense clusters ; it remains to be seen if the steady - state conditions in the central parsec can mimic those in the formation epoch of a young cluster . or are these `` stars '' really more exotic objects such as compact stars with atmospheres acquired by passage through a dense medium or by collisions with red giant stars ( morris 1993 ) ?",
    "perhaps they are stars powered by dark matter annihilation in their interiors ( salati & silk 1989 ) , in which case they would be much longer - lived than a star of comparable mass .    in any of these cases ,",
    "the explanation for the presence of these stars would be exceedingly interesting , and continued investigation well worthwhile .",
    "we find that about half a dozen of the stars projected within a few thousand au of sgr  a@xmath6 have little , if any , co absorption in their _",
    "k_-band spectra , indicating that the stars are hot .",
    "coupled with their brightnesses , we suggest that the stars are obv types , and therefore @xmath3  20  old . given the lifetimes of such stars , it is improbable that they formed beyond 0.1 pc of the galactic center , forcing us to consider the possibility that gas clumps having n  @xmath31  10@xmath32  @xmath33 can exist within a few thousand au of a supermassive black hole .",
