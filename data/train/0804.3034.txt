    "the initial - final mass relationship of white dwarfs links the mass of a white dwarf with that of its progenitor in the main - sequence .",
    "this function is of paramount importance for several aspects of modern astrophysiscs such as the determination of the ages of globular clusters and their distances , the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies , and also to understand the properties of the galactic population of white dwarfs .",
    "however , we still do not have an accurate measurement of this relationship and , consequently , more efforts are needed from both the theoretical and the observational perspectives to improve it .    @xcite carried out the first attempt to empirically map this relationship , and provided also a recent revision @xcite .",
    "although many improvements have been achieved in these 30 years , there are still some pieces missing in the puzzle . for instance , the dependence of this function on different parameters is still not clear ( e.g.  metallicity , magnetic field , angular momentum ) . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous works have dealt with the calculation of a theoretical initial - final mass relationship @xcite , but the differences in their evolutionary codes , such as the treatment of convection , the value of the assumed critical mass , which is the maximum mass of a white dwarf progenitor , or the mass loss prescriptions used lead to very different results .",
    "the main differences between the different theoretical approaches to the initial - final mass relationship have been extensively discussed in @xcite .    from an observational perspective",
    ", most efforts up to now have focused on the observation of white dwarfs in open clusters , since this allows to infer the total age and the original metallicity of white dwarfs belonging to the cluster @xcite .",
    "open clusters have made possible the derivation of a semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship using more than 50 white dwarfs , although only covering the initial mass range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 because stellar clusters are relatively young and , hence , the white dwarf progenitors in these clusters are generally massive .",
    "the recent study of @xcite based in old open clusters ( ngc 7789 , ngc 6819 and ngc6791 ) has extended this mass range to smaller masses . a parallel attempt to cover the low - mass range of the initial - final mass relationship has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "this was the first study of this relationship based in common proper motion pairs .",
    "the stars studied in @xcite are at shorter distances in comparison with star clusters and this allows a better spectroscopic study of both members of the pair , obtaining their stellar parameters with accuracy . at the same time",
    ", the study of these pairs enables a wide age and metallicity coverage of the initial - final mass relationship .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform a revision of the initial - final mass relationship taking into account our recent results from studying white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs @xcite and the available data that are currently being used to define the initial - final mass relationship .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the analysis of the data that we will use to define the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the detailed analysis of the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship derived in this paper and to give some clues on its dependence on some parameters , such as metallicity . in  4 and  5",
    "we compute the luminosity function and the mass distribution of white dwarfs considering different initial - final mass relationships and compare our results with the available observational data .",
    "finally in  6 we summarize our main results and we draw our conclusions .",
    "[ tab : mif ]    [ tab : mif2 ]      we have carried out a re - analysis of the available data currently used to define the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship , which is mainly based on white dwarfs in open clusters .",
    "we have used the white dwarf atmospheric parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) derived by other authors , as well as the ages and metallicities of the clusters reported in the literature . to obtain the final and initial masses we followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this procedure consists in deriving the final mass ( @xmath5 ) and the cooling time of each white dwarf from the atmospheric parameters and the cooling sequences of @xcite .",
    "these cooling tracks consider a carbon - oxygen ( co ) core white dwarf ( with a larger abundance of o at the centre of the core ) with a h thick envelope ontop of a he buffer , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as it will be shown in the next section , the thicknesses of these envelops are very important in the cooling of white dwarfs .",
    "these improved cooling sequences include an accurate treatment of the crystallization process of the co core , including phase separation upon crystallization , together with up - to - date input physics suitable for computing white dwarf evolution . since we know the total ages of these white dwarfs ( from the age of the cluster ) we derived the main - sequence lifetimes of the progenitors , and from these , their initial masses using the stellar tracks of @xcite . at present",
    ", the atmospheric parameters of white dwarfs can be determined with accuracy if they correspond to the da type , that is , if their spectra shows uniquely the hydrogen absorption lines . for this reason , and in order to keep consistency in the cooling sequences used we only consider da white dwarfs in our study . in table [",
    "tab : mif ] we give the initial and final masses that we have recalculated for white dwarfs in open clusters .",
    "other information such as the atmospheric parameters , cooling times , main - sequence lifetimes of the progenitors and metallicities are also given .",
    "those white dwarfs for which we have obtained a cooling time longer than its total age have not been included in our study , since this is a good indication that the star does not belong to the cluster , or it has not a co core . to compute the errors of the final masses we have taken into account the errors of the atmospheric parameters . in the case of the initial masses",
    "we have taken into account the errors of the cooling times , which come from the atmospheric parameters , and the errors of the total ages of the white dwarfs . when no error for the total age was given in the literature ,",
    "a value of 10 per cent was adopted . finally , as reported in @xcite , to derive the initial masses of white dwarfs belonging to common proper motion pairs , the error of the metallicity",
    "was also taken into account .",
    "@xcite performed spectroscopic observations of 30 white dwarfs belonging to ngc 2099 ( m37 ) . @xcite",
    "determined the age and metallicity of m37 , @xmath8 myr and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we assume an error of 10 per cent in the age of m37 .",
    "we use the atmospheric parameters reported by williams , bolte & koester ( 2004 ) . @xcite",
    "estimated the metallicity of this cluster , [ fe / h]@xmath10 .",
    "thus , we use the stellar tracks corresponding to @xmath11 . as in @xcite",

    "the atmospheric parameters of lawds1 and lawds27 correspond to new data from @xcite .",
    "the cluster data are from @xcite , although we have used the latest results of @xcite reported in @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite the age of this cluster is 300@xmath13150 , and the metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath14 ( twarog , ashman & anthony - twarog , 1997 ) or [ fe / h]@xmath15 ( chen , hou & hang , 2003 ) , so we have used the tracks corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "we have also included the data for three white dwarfs reported in @xcite , although the resolution is a bit lower .",
    "we have used the data of @xcite for the hyades and part of the praesepe sample .",
    "we have included also two stars studied by @xcite and some recent results on six new stars @xcite . according to @xcite , the hyades cluster has an age of 625@xmath1350 myr .",
    "we assume the same value for praesepe , since both belong to the same hyades supercluster .",
    "the metallicity is [ fe / h]@xmath17 according to @xcite , so we used the stellar tracks corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "we consider the atmospheric parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "the age of the cluster is that determined by meynet , mermilliod & maeder ( 1993 ) , 141@xmath132 myr .",
    "this cluster has a solar metallicity according to jeffries , james & thurston ( 1998 ) .",
    "we include the recent results obtained by @xcite based on spectroscopic observations of white dwarfs in different old clusters .",
    "these results , as well as the ones obtained by @xcite are somewhat relevant , since constitute the first constraints on the low - mass end of the initial - final mass relationship .",
    "ngc 6791 is one of the oldest and most metal - rich open clusters .",
    "according to @xcite , ngc 6791 has an age of 8.5 gyr and [ fe / h]@xmath19 .",
    "we have used the stellar tracks corresponding to @xmath20 .",
    "the white dwarfs of this cluster have relatively low masses ( @xmath21 ) , so the majority of white dwarfs belonging to this cluster could have a he core @xcite .",
    "although it has been suggested that he - core white dwarfs could be formed also by single - evolution ( kilic , stanek & pinsonneault , 2007 ) , we prefer not to take these white dwarfs into account , and only consider the two confirmed cluster members with masses above this value . in this case , we assume an error of 10 per cent in the age of ngc 6791 .    the white dwarf population of ngc 7789 and ngc 6819 were also studied recently by @xcite . according to their results , ngc 7789",
    "has an age of 1.4@xmath130.14 gyr and a metallicity of @xmath22 , while ngc 6819 has an age of 2.5@xmath130.25 gyr and @xmath23 .",
    "wd0349@xmath24247 is the only known pleiades white dwarf .",
    "we have used the atmospheric parameters derived by @xcite .",
    "the age of the pleiades is 125@xmath138 myr according to rebolo , martin & magazzu ( 1992 ) and it has a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we use the stellar tracks corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "sirius b is a very well - known da white dwarf that belongs to a visual binary system .",
    "since the separation between the members of this system is @xmath26 au it can be assumed that there has not been any significant interaction between them during the agb phase of the progenitor of the white dwarf member @xcite .",
    "thus , it can be considered that sirius b has evolved as a single star , and therefore it is a good candidate for studying the initial - final mass relationship . in this work ,",
    "we use the atmospheric parameters determined by @xcite , an age of 237@xmath1312 myr and solar metallicity .      in principle",
    ", globular clusters could also be used for improving the initial - final mass relationship since they have some characteristics which are similar to those of open clusters , but we have decided not to include them since the study of white dwarfs in globular clusters still suffers from large uncertainties .",
    "globular clusters contain thousands to millions of stars .",
    "however , white dwarfs belonging to them are usually very faint due to their large distances , which difficults obtaining high signal - to - noise spectra . moreover , since globular clusters usually have crowded fields it is also difficult to isolate each star properly when performing spectroscopic observations .",
    "therefore , the reduction procedure , mainly the background substraction , is also more complicated . up to now",
    ", the white dwarf population of globular clusters has been mainly used to determine their distances and ages @xcite . an important attempt to derive the masses of white dwarfs in globular clusters",
    "( ngc 6397 and ngc 6752 ) was carried out by @xcite . however , due to the low signal - to - noise and resolution of the spectra , they were not able to derive their spectroscopic masses independently and had to use a combination of spectra with photometry .",
    "although they calculated an average mass for the white dwarfs in ngc 6752 we have decided not to include this value in our work . instead , we prefer to use data of individual white dwarfs rather than a binned value for a cluster , contrary to that done in other works @xcite .      in the case of the common proper motion pairs , the procedure that we followed to derive the final and initial masses of the white dwarfs",
    "is explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "it mainly consisted in performing independent spectroscopic observations of the components of several common proper motion pairs composed of a da white dwarf and a fgk star . from the fit of the white dwarf spectra to synthetic models we derived their atmospheric parameters , and from these their masses and cooling times using the cooling sequences of @xcite . in order to derive the initial masses of the white dwarfs we performed independent high - resolution spectroscopic observations of their companions ( fgk stars ) .",
    "since it can be assumed that the members of a common proper motion pair were born simultaneously and with the same chemical composition @xcite , the ages and metallicities of both members of the pair should be the same . from a detailed analysis of the spectra of the companions we derived their metallicites .",
    "then , we obtained their ages using either stellar isochrones , if the star was moderatly evolved , or the x - ray luminosity if the star was very close to the zams ( ribas et al . in preparation ) .",
    "once we had the total age of the white dwarfs and the metallicity of their progenitors we derived their initial masses using the stellar tracks of @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : mif2 ] we give the initial and final masses resulting from this study .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : mif ] we present the final versus the initial masses obtained for white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs and open clusters . the observational data that can be used to define the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship contains now 62 white dwarfs .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all the values below @xmath27 correspond to our data obtained from common proper motion pairs ( cpmps ) and the recent data obtained by @xcite  k08 .",
    "before these studies no data for these small masses were available , since white dwarfs in stellar clusters are usually more massive , especially if the clusters are young .",
    "the coverage of the low - mass end of the initial - final mass relationship is specially important since it guarantees , according to the theory of stellar evolution , the study of white dwarfs with masses near the typical values , @xmath28 , which represent about 90 per cent of the white dwarf population @xcite .",
    "thus , these new data increase the statistical significance of the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship .    a first inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] reveals that there is a clear dependence of the white dwarf masses on the masses of their progenitors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] , we have also plotted the theoretical initial - final mass relationships of @xcite for different metallicities to be consistent with the stellar tracks used to derive the initial masses .",
    "although the distribution presents a large dispersion , a comparison of the observational data with these theoretical relationships shows that they share the same trend .",
    "however , it should be noted that for each cluster the data presents an intrinsic spread in mass .",
    "the dispersion varies from cluster to cluster , but it is particularly noticeable for the case of m37 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be taken into account as well that the observations of m37 were of poorer quality than the rest of the data @xcite .",
    "the results obtained are dependent on different assumptions and approaches that we have considered during the procedure followed to derive the final and initial masses , we discuss them separately .",
    "the fact that the observed white dwarf masses in clusters scatter considerably in the same region of initial masses , as pointed out by other authors  see , for instance , @xcite  may indicate that mass loss could depend more on individual stellar properties than on a global mechanism , and that it could be a stochastic phenomenon , especially on the agb phase .",
    "mass loss has a large impact on the final composition of the outer layers of white dwarfs , since it defines the thicknesses of the outer he and h ( if present ) layers . in fact , another reason that may explain why white dwarfs with different final masses could have progenitors with very similar initial masses is the assumption of a given internal composition and outer layer stratification of the white dwarfs under study .",
    "the thicknesses of the h and he layers is a key factor in the evolution of white dwarfs , since they control the rate at which white dwarfs cool down . in this work we have used cooling sequences with fixed thicknesses of these envelopes , which might be more appropriate in some cases than in others .",
    "in fact , the exact masses that the layers of h and he may have is currently a matter of debate being the subject of several studies .",
    "for instance , @xcite computed models reducing the thickness of the h envelope to @xmath29 , obtaining cooling times shorter than those obtained in this work assuming a thick envelope ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is natural since h has a larger opacity than he , and h is the major insulating component of the star . in the case of an even thinner h envelope ( @xmath31 ) the cooling age",
    "could be reduced in 10 per cent ( 1 gyr ) at @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the uncertainty in the cooling times could be relevant in some cases , which would affect the estimates of the progenitor lifetimes and in turn , the initial masses derived .    in order to estimate the effect that the thicknesses of h and he envelopes may have in the initial masses derived here",
    ", we have repeated the calculations of section 2 but using the cooling sequences of fontaine , brassard & bergeron ( 2001 ) for a 50/50 co core white dwarf with a standard he envelope , @xmath33 , and two different thicknesses for the h envelope , a thick one ( @xmath34 ) and a thin one ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we have verified that the initial masses are indeed sensitive to the cooling sequences used , as expected .",
    "we have obtained larger initial masses when considering a thin envelope , due to the longer cooling times obtained in this case .",
    "as previously pointed out , in principle it can be expected that the cooling time scale should be smaller for a thin h envelope model , but this assumption is only true at low enough luminosities @xcite .",
    "in fact , at intermediate luminosities a white dwarf with a thinner h envelope evolves slower than the thicker counterpart because it has an excess of energy to irradiate ( tassoul , fontaine & winget , 1990 ) .",
    "the maximum difference in the initial masses ( @xmath35 ) has been found to occur for high - mass progenitors ( @xmath36 ) , while this value is one order of magnitude smaller for smaller masses ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that many other combinations are possible , for instance , with different thicknesses of the he envelope , which in this case has been kept fixed .",
    "however , since it is impossible to know which is the real chemical stratification of the outer layers of each individual white dwarf we have not formally introduced this error in the calculations , since in some cases we would be overestimating the error of the initial masses derived in this work .      it should be taken into account that besides a co core , white dwarfs can have other internal compositions .",
    "those white dwarfs more massive than @xmath38 are thought to have a core made of one ( garca - berro , ritossa & iben , 1997 ; ritossa , garca - berro & iben , 1996 ) , while those with masses below @xmath39 have an he - core .",
    "one white dwarfs cool faster than co or he white dwarfs because the heat capacity of o and ne is smaller than that of c or he @xcite . on the contrary , he white dwarfs are the ones that cool slower @xcite .",
    "thus , those white dwarfs studied here with masses near the limits between different populations would be introducing an uncertainty in the cooling times obtained , since their cooling timescales are completely different from one composition to another .",
    "for example , a @xmath40 one white dwarf cools 1.5 times faster than a co white dwarf with the same mass @xcite .",
    "thus , if an observed white dwarf has indeed a one core instead of the typical co one , its progenitor lifetime would be underestimated in our analysis , and as a consequence , the initial mass derived would be more massive than the real one . however , the exact impact of this depends also on the total age of the white dwarf .",
    "the smaller the total age , the higher the effect of considering a wrong internal composition .",
    "the errors reported in our study for the final masses only take into account the errors in the determination of the atmospheric parameters , which can be derived with accuracy if high signal - to - noise spectra are acquired .",
    "however , it should be noted that this accuracy decreases considerably at low effective temperatures . according to bergeron , wesemael & fontaine ( 1992 ) , the atmospheres of da stars below @xmath42",
    "k could be enriched in he while preserving their da spectral type .",
    "this he is thought to be brought to the surface as a consequence of the developement of a h convection zone .",
    "depending on the efficiency of convection the star could still show balmer lines , instead of being converted into a non - da white dwarf .",
    "thus , the assumption of an unrealistic chemical composition could have a large impact on the cooling times estimated , but mainly at low effective temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , a very large fraction of the stars in our sample ( @xmath4395 per cent ) have temperatures well above this limit .",
    "as already pointed out , the derived initial masses depend on the cooling times , the total ages , the metallicity and finally , on the stellar tracks used . among these parameters",
    "the largest source of error is due to the uncertainty in the total ages of the white dwarfs . for white dwarfs in open clusters",
    ", the age can be usually derived with high accuracy from model fits to the turn - off location in a colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "the uncertainty on the age of a cluster is a systematic effect for stars belonging to the same cluster , since all the initial masses will be shifted together to larger or smaller masses in the final versus initial masses diagram @xcite . on the contrary , in the case of white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs ,",
    "the accuracy in the total age depends on the evolutionary stage of the companion .",
    "the accuracy of the age using isochrone fitting could be high if the star is relatively evolved and located far away from the zams .",
    "using the x - ray luminosity method , described in @xcite , the ages derived could also be quite precise ( from 8 to 20 per cent ) if the star is relatively young ( @xmath44  gyr ) .",
    "following closely recent works on this subject @xcite , we assume that the initial - final mass relationship can be described as a linear function .",
    "we have performed a weighted least - squares linear fit of the data , obtaining that the best solution is    @xmath45    where the errors are the standard deviation of the coefficients .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif2 ] we represent all the data that we have re - calculated and this linear fit ( dotted line ) . in past works , since there was not available data in the region of low - mass white dwarfs , a least - squares linear fit led to an unconstrained result @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a ficticious anchor point at low masses was used to represent the typical white dwarf mass of @xmath46 @xcite . in our case , this is not necessary since we are now reproducing this well - established peak of the field white dwarf mass distribution thanks to the new data in the low - mass region @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif2 ] the theoretical initial - final mass relationship can be divided in two different linear functions , each one above and below 2.7  @xmath47 , with a shallower slope for small masses probably due to the smaller efficiency of mass loss . taking this into account",
    "we have performed a weighted least - squares linear fit for each region , obtaining    @xmath48    for @xmath49 , whereas for @xmath50 we obtain :    @xmath51    in these expressions the errors are the standard deviation of the coefficients .",
    "these two independent fits , which are represented as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif2 ] , seem to reproduce better the observational data than a unique linear fit ( dotted line ) . taking into account the scatter of the data and the values of the reduced @xmath52 of these fits ( 7.1 and 4.4 , respectively ) we consider that the errors associated to the coefficients are underestimated .",
    "a more realistic error can be obtained computing the dispersion of the derived final masses , which is of @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "these are the errors that should be associated to the final mass when using the expressions derived here  eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mf_mi2 ] ) and ( [ eq : mf_mi3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , there are other parameters besides the mass of the progenitor that may have an impact on the final masses of white dwarfs ( e.g.  metallicity or rotation ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the results that we have obtained so far allows us to give some clues on the dependence of the initial - final mass relationship on these parameters .",
    "we discuss them below .",
    "the sample of white dwarfs studied here covers a range of metallicities from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is well established that progenitors with large metallicity produce less massive white dwarfs  see the relations of @xcite plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] .",
    "thus , one should expect to see a dependence of the semi - empirical data on metallicity .",
    "our purpose in this section is to compare data with the same and different metallicity and evaluate if the differences in the derived masses are smaller or greater in this two cases .",
    "open clusters are appropriate for carrying out such comparison , since all the stars belonging to a particular cluster have the same metallicity .",
    "for instance , in the case of the two stars from praesepe ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] ) with initial masses around @xmath57 , the white dwarfs differ in @xmath58 .",
    "however , for the rest of stars in this cluster , the dispersion is significantly smaller ( a factor of 2 ) .",
    "thus , the large spread could be explained by considering that may be these objects are field stars .",
    "however , the sample of white dwarfs in the praesepe cluster has been well studied @xcite and it is unlikely that these stars do not belong to the cluster .",
    "the hyades also contain a large number of white dwarfs , for which the initial and final masses have been derived with accuracy . in this case , all the data points fall in the region limited by the theoretical relations of @xcite , and the scatter is @xmath59 , which is the same as the difference between the theoretical relations corresponding to @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this is the minimum scatter found in the observational data , since the points corresponding to the hyades , together with those of praesepe , are the ones with smaller error bars . in any case , this scatter , although smaller than in other cases , is still larger than the uncertainties , which prevents to derive any clear dependence on metallicity . as previously pointed out , the data of m37 present the largest scatter in the sample ( @xmath62 ) , but it should be noticed that the errors in the final masses are considerably larger than for the rest of the clusters .",
    "it is important to evaluate if the dispersion increases when data with different metallicities is considered . comparing points with the same initial mass but different metallicities , it can be noted that @xmath63 is of the same order as in the case of equal metallicities .",
    "for example , comparing the data of m37 and the data of the hyades  which have metallicities @xmath9 and @xmath18 , respectively  for an initial mass around @xmath64 , @xmath63 is @xmath65 , but this scatter is the same when we compare data from m37 only .",
    "however , the scatter decreases when we analyse larger initial masses .",
    "if the data of m35 and m37 are compared ( metallicites @xmath9 ) with the data of ngc3532 and one of the common proper motion pairs located at @xmath66 ( with @xmath61 ) , it can be seen that the maximum @xmath63 is @xmath67 , although this is also what we obtain when we compare only the data of m35 located in this region . in the region of small masses",
    "we have data ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath20 , but the maximum scatter is the same regardless of the metallicity of the stars ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "finally , at the high - mass end we find the same dispersion , although in this case the data have the same metallicity .",
    "thus , considering the current accuracy of the available observational data we do not find any clear dependence of the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship on metallicity .",
    "it is interesting to perform a more quantitative study of the correlation between the final masses and metallicity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_cor ] we plot the differences between the observed final masses and the final masses obtained using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mf_mi2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : mf_mi3 ] ) as a function of metallicity",
    ". the dashed line corresponds to the hypothetical case in which there is no difference between the observational and the values predicted by these relations . in order to quantify the correlation in the sample of points presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_cor ] , we have calculated the spearman rank correlation coefficient .",
    "the value obtained is 0.036 , which is very close to zero , indicating that there is an extremely weak positive correlation between the difference in the final masses and metallicity . since the spearman correlation does not take into account the errors of the values considered , we have carried out a bootstrapping in order to evaluate the actual uncertainty on the correlation coefficient without any assumption on the error bars .",
    "this consists on choosing at random @xmath68 objects from our sample ( which has also @xmath68 objects ) allowing repetition , and then calculating the new correlation coefficient for each of these new samples .",
    "we have performed this a large number of times ( 5000 ) obtaining a mean correlation coefficient of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the final masses and metallicity of this sample does not present any correlation , and that the scatter in the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] is not due to the effect of metallicity .",
    "of course , it should be taken into account that the observed final masses have been derived using the atmospheric parameters reported by different authors who have considered also different white dwarf models , although the prescriptions used in the fits are usually those of @xcite in all the cases .",
    "it is worth comparing our results with other works .",
    "for instance , @xcite claimed that they had found the first evidence of a metallicity dependence on the initial - final mass relationship .",
    "they noticed that half of their data of m37 ( also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mif ] ) were in agreement with the theoretical relationship of @xcite , and considered this result as an indication of dependence on metallicity .",
    "on the other hand , in a recent revision of the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship , @xcite analyzed part of the cluster data discussed here by deriving a binned semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship .",
    "this consisted in associating an initial and a final mass for each cluster by calculating the mean of the initial and final masses of the individual white dwarfs belonging to that cluster .",
    "then , they compared these values as function of metallicity and , as in our case , they did not find a clear dependence of the semi - empirical data on metallicity .",
    "in fact , their conclusion was that metallicity should affect the final mass only in @xmath53 , considering an initial mass of @xmath64 , which is in good accord with our results .",
    "according to @xcite , fast rotating stars produce more massive white dwarfs than slow rotating stars .",
    "the models calculated by @xcite including rotation predict that for a fast rotating star with an initial mass of @xmath0 the white dwarf produced has a mass in the range @xmath70 to @xmath71 , which is considerably larger than when rotation is disregarded @xcite . among our sample of white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs",
    "there are two stars ( wd1659@xmath72531 and wd1620@xmath72391 ) that might exemplify the effect that rotation may have in stellar evolution .",
    "the companion of wd1659@xmath72531 , hd153580 , is a fast rotating star according to @xcite , with a tangential velocity @xmath73 km s@xmath74 .",
    "thus , we can hypotetically assume that the progenitor of wd1659@xmath72531 was also a fast rotator .",
    "if we compare the masses derived for these stars ( table [ tab : mif2 ] ) we can note that starting from an initial mass of @xmath75 , which is more than two times smaller than the progenitor of wd1620@xmath72391 ( @xmath76 ) , it ends up as a white dwarf with approximately the same mass , @xmath77 .",
    "this indicates that the progenitor of wd1659@xmath72531 lost less mass during the agb phase than the progenitor of wd1620@xmath72391 .",
    "these differences may not be related to metallicity , since both progenitors had solar composition .",
    "thus , we think that this could be the first evidence showing that rotation may have a strong impact in the evolution of a star , leading to more massive white dwarfs , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "one way to detect the presence of magnetic fields in white dwarfs is by performing spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "some of the white dwarfs belonging to this sample have been the subject of studies to investigate their magnetic nature .",
    "in particular , wd 0837@xmath24199 ( also known as eg61 ) , which belongs to praesepe , is the only known magnetic white dwarf in an open cluster .",
    "the magnetic field of this star is of 3 mg according to the study of @xcite .",
    "the mass that we have obtained for this star is @xmath78 ( see table [ tab : mif2 ] ) , rather large , although a bit smaller than the typical mass of magnetic white dwarfs , which is around @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "regarding white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs , @xcite also obtained circularly polarized spectra of wd0413@xmath72017 , wd1544@xmath72377 , wd1620@xmath72391 and wd1659@xmath72531 , finding evidence of magnetism only for the first of these stars .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the findings of other authors @xcite . in the case of wd0413@xmath72017 ,",
    "more commonly known as 40 eri b , the magnetic field is rather weak , 2.3 kg , and the mass that we have derived is @xmath80 .",
    "although the mass of this star is well below the typical mass of magnetic white dwarfs , it is in good agreement with the rest of white dwarfs studied by @xcite at the kg level . if we do not consider wd 0837@xmath24199 and wd0413@xmath72017 in the fit carried out in the last section we obtain negligible changes on the expressions derived .",
    "spectropolarimetric surveys of white dwarfs have suggested that there is a decline in the incidence of magnetism of stars with fields @xmath81 g , although this incidence seems to rise again when the field is much lower , @xmath82 kg @xcite .",
    "the sample of white dwarfs that we have considered in this work contains two magnetic white dwarfs , one with a strong magnetic field and the other with a rather weak magnetic field . although the influence of the magnetic field in stellar evolution has not been yet established , we find that the final masses obtained in these two cases are very different , being larger when the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "so , it is reasonable to think that the magnetic field could play a key role on the evolution of the progenitor star .",
    "however , with the current data on the magnetic white dwarfs belonging to the sample of white dwarfs used in this work it is not possible to favor one of the two main hypothesis regarding this issue : whether magnetic white dwarfs are more massive because the progenitors were also more massive ( without any dependence on the magnetic field ) , or on the contrary , magnetic white dwarfs are more massive because the magnetic field had an influence during its evolution , favoring the growth of the core .    according to @xcite , 16 per cent of the white dwarf population",
    "should be comprised by magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "so , among the sample of stars considered in this work , we could expect 9 - 10 white dwarfs to be magnetic .",
    "thus , spectropolarimetric observations of the current sample of white dwarfs used to define the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship would be very useful to shed some light upon this subject .",
    "the white dwarf luminosity function is defined as the number of white dwarfs per unit volume and per bolometric magnitude  see , for instance , @xcite :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the mass of the progenitor of the white dwarf , @xmath85 is its characteristic cooling time , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the minimum and maximum mass of the progenitor star able to produce a white dwarf with a bolometric magnitude @xmath88 at time @xmath89 , @xmath90 is the time necessary to cool down to bolometric magnitude @xmath88  for which we adopt the results of @xcite and @xcite for co and one white dwarfs , respectively  @xmath91 is the lifetime of the progenitor , @xmath89 is the age of the population under study , @xmath92 is the star formation rate  which we assume to be constant  and @xmath93 is the initial mass function , for which we adopt the expression of @xcite .          to compute the white dwarf luminosity function it is also necessary to provide a relationship between the mass of the progenitor and the mass of the resulting white dwarf , that is , the initial - final mass relationship . additionally , the influence of the progenitors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdlf ] ) appears through the age assigned to the progenitor , which determines the star formation rate , and through the cooling time , @xmath90 and the characteristic cooling time , @xmath94 , which depend on the mass of the white dwarf . in order to evaluate the influence of these inputs ,",
    "we have computed a series of theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions using several initial - final mass relationships ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ifmr ] ) and evolutive tracks for the progenitor stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mslife ] ) . whenever possible we have adopted the same set of stellar evolutionary inputs , that is , the initial - final mass relationship and the main - sequence lifetime corresponding to the same set of calculations .",
    "we compare the resulting theoretical luminosity functions with the data obtained by averaging the different observational determinations of the white dwarf luminosity function ( knox , hawkins & hambly , 1999 ; leggett , ruiz & bergeron , 1998 ; oswalt et al . 1996",
    "; liebert , dahn & monet , 1988 ) .",
    "the theoretical white dwarf luminosity functions were also normalized to the observational value with the smallest error bars in number density of white dwarfs , that is @xmath95 , @xmath96 , avoiding in this way the region in which the cooling is dominated by neutrinos ( at large luminosities ) and the region in which crystallization is the dominant physical process  at luminosities between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "[ fig : lum - var ] shows the resulting white dwarf luminosity functions when different stellar evolutionary inputs are used . at low luminosities",
    "it can be noticed the characteristic sharp down - turn in the density of white dwarfs .",
    "this cut - off in the number counts has been interpreted by different authors @xcite as the consequence of the finite age of the galactic disc .",
    "thus , a comparison between the theoretical luminosity functions and the observational data can provide information about the age of the galactic disc . in this figure",
    "the cut - off of the observational white dwarf luminosity function has been fitted using an age of the disc of @xmath99 gyr for all the cases except for the case in which the expressions of @xcite were used . in this last case",
    "the best - fitting is obtained using @xmath100 gyr .",
    "this can be understood by comparing the different stellar evolutionary inputs considered in this work . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifmr ] , the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite is the one that produces less massive white dwarfs .",
    "the semi - empirical relationship that we have derived in this work is similar to that of hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) .",
    "@xcite predicts more massive white dwarfs at the intermediate mass domain , whereas the results of @xcite produce more massive remnants for the low - mass end and less massive white dwarfs for the high mass end , but always substantially larger than those obtained with the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite .",
    "these differences mainly arise from the procedure used to calculate each theoretical initial - final mass relationship .",
    "the relations derived by @xcite and @xcite are obtained using fully evolutive models but using different treatments of convective boundaries , mixing and mass - loss rates on the agb phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the relations of @xcite were obtained from a fitting of the observational data from eclipsing binaries and open clusters , obtaining analytic formulae for different metallicities . finally , the relation of @xcite is an exponential expression derived from a fit to the pnn mass distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslife ] we show the different main - sequence lifetimes as a function of the main - sequence mass . in those cases",
    "in which there was a dependence on metallicity we have adopted @xmath101 . as it can be seen there , the behaviour of the different main - sequence lifetimes is very similar , although for the case of @xcite , stars spend more time in the main - sequence than in the rest of cases , especially for those stars with large masses . considering this",
    ", one should expect that the fit of the cut - off of the white dwarf luminosity function would correspond to a longer galactic disc age when using the expressions of @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , we have obtained a younger galactic disc .",
    "the longer progenitors lifetimes of @xcite are in part compensated by the fact that its corresponding initial - final mass relationship favors the production of low - mass white dwarfs , which cool down faster at high luminosities .",
    "a simple test can be done by using , for example , the stellar tracks of @xcite , which give shorter progenitor lifetimes , and the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite . in this case",
    "we obtain a galactic disc age of 10 gyr , 1 gyr younger than if we consider any of the other initial - final mass relationships shown in fig .  [ fig : ifmr ] .",
    "thus , the behaviour of the relation of @xcite is clearly different from others in the literature , and this has important implications on the resulting white dwarf luminosity functions .    comparing the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : lum - var ] it can be noticed that for the hot end of the white dwarf luminosity function there are not differences whatsoever .",
    "in fact , all the theoretical luminosity functions are remarkably coincident . the only visible differences ,",
    "although not very relevant , occur just after the crystallization phase has started , at @xmath102 .",
    "two essential physical processes are associated with crystallization , namely , a release of latent heat and a modification of the chemical concentrations in the solid phase .",
    "both provide extra energy sources and lengthen the cooling time of the star .",
    "this is the reason why all the theoretical calculations predict a larger number of white dwarfs for these luminosity bins . beyond the cut - off",
    ", we find that the density of white dwarfs is smaller in the case of @xcite , and this is because this region is dominated by massive white dwarfs , since the progenitors of these stars were also massive , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslife ] spent less time at the main - sequence .",
    "thus , massive white dwarfs have had enough time to cool down to such low luminosities . in any case",
    ", it is worth mentioning that low - mass white dwarfs cool faster at high luminosities , but for small luminosities it occurs just the opposite , since massive white dwarfs crystallize at larger luminosities , and this implies smaller time delays .         and",
    "@xmath103 . circles , triangles and squares correspond to the observational data of @xcite . ]",
    "the influence of the initial - final mass relationship on the white dwarf luminosity function should be more evident when it is constrained to massive white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "recently , liebert , bergeron & holberg ( 2005b ) performed high signal - to - noise spectroscopic observations of more than 300 white dwarfs belonging to the palomar green ( pg ) survey .",
    "the analysis of this set of data has provided us with a sample of white dwarfs with well determined masses that allows for the first time the study of the white dwarf luminosity function of massive white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , according to @xcite the completeness of the sample decreases severely near @xmath104  k , where white dwarfs with small masses ( @xmath105 ) are brighter ( @xmath106 ) than massive white dwarfs with @xmath107 ( which have visual magnitudes around @xmath108 ) .",

    "this is obviously due to the fact that the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite favors the production of low - mass white dwarfs .",

    "the star formation rate considered in our calculations has also an important influence on the number of massive white dwarfs produced . in our previous calculations",
    "we have considered a constant star formation rate , which has led us to obtain more massive white dwarfs than those detected in the pg survey . to evaluate the effect of the star formation rate on the white dwarf luminosity function we have repeated the calculations considering the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship derived in this work and an exponentially decreasing star formation rate @xmath113 , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 gyr , respectively . as it can be noted from fig .",

    "the agreement is better if we consider a variable star formation rate .",
    "however , for such massive stars there is only data for one magnitude bin .",
    "more observations corresponding to massive white dwarfs are needed to confirm this behaviour of the luminosity function .    for the sake of comparison",
    "we have carried out the same calculations but considering the expressions of @xcite .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lum - sfrmag2 ] . in this case",
    ", the observational data for stars with masses larger than @xmath111 is not fitted regardless of the star formation rate assumed . on the contrary ,",
    "the fit is better when considering stars with masses above @xmath103 .",
    "since there are more observational data for the range of masses above @xmath111 , we find more reliable the conclusions that can be obtained from a comparison of these data than those obtained from only one magnitude bin , as is the case of more massive white dwarfs .",
    "thus , it seems clear that observations rule out the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite , and that the other initial - final mass relationships used in this work seem to be more reliable , although the present status of the observational data does not allow to draw a definite conclusion about which initial - final mass relationship is more adequate .",
    "the understanding of the precise shape of the mass distribution of white dwarfs offers a sorely needed insight about the total amount of mass lost during the course of the last phases of stellar evolution .",
    "thus , a detailed study of this function , from both the theoretical and the observational perspectives can give us clues on the initial - final mass relationship @xcite . for that purpose , we have computed a series of theoretical mass distributions using different evolutive stellar models and their corresponding initial - final mass relationships , if available . as in the case of the white dwarf luminosity function we have adopted an age of 11 gyr for the galactic disc , a constant star formation rate and the initial mass function of salpeter .",

    "we have computed the observational mass distribution considering the @xmath118 values reported by @xcite taking into account the errors in the masses assuming a gaussian distribution .",

    "all the white dwarf distributions have been normalized to the total density obtained in each case .",
    "as it can be noted , there is a well defined peak in all the mass distributions , the location of which is defined mainly by the initial - final mass relationship considered . on the contrary , the height of the peak depends also on the lifetime of the progenitors .",
    "this can be understood with the help of fig .",
    "[ fig : ifmr ] .",
    "the most abundant stars are those with small masses ( @xmath35 ) . in the case of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the white dwarfs corresponding to these progenitors have masses well below @xmath119 , and this is the reason why the central peak is located at smaller masses in fig .  [",
    "fig : mass ] .",
    "this peak is then shifted to larger masses when the initial - final mass relationship considered favors the production of more massive white dwarfs for the low mass progenitors .",
    "this is the case of the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship of @xcite , our relationship or the theoretical relation of @xcite .",
    "note that in the latter case , the production of massive white dwarfs is not favored , opposite to what occurs to our semi - empirical relationship , but the peak is located at the same mass since low - mass progenitors are the ones that dominate .    if we compare the theoretical mass functions with the observational data of @xcite from the pg survey ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) and the recent data obtained by @xcite from the sdss ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) it can be noted how in both cases the location of the central peak is well fitted by the predictions corresponding to our semi - empirical relationship and the theoretical relation of @xcite .",
    "the height of the peak is better fitted when considering our semi - empirical relationship , although a bit lower in comparison with the sdss data .",
    "the sample of white dwarfs corresponding to the sdss is very complete since it includes the 1733 stars with @xmath120 and @xmath121 k present in the sdss dr4 , which is seven times the population covered by the pg survey .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have not included the he white dwarf population in our calculations .",
    "this is the reason why there are no white dwarfs below a certain mass threshold ( @xmath122 in the case of our semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship ) .",
    "the observational data ( both from the pg survey or the sdss ) do indeed present a certain number of white dwarfs in this low - mass region . on the other hand ,",
    "we have included the one white dwarf population which is thought to be dominant for masses larger than @xmath38 . one - core white dwarfs cool faster than co - core white dwarfs due to the large heat capacity of c in comparison with that of o and ne . for this reason",
    "a bump located at @xmath38 in the mass distribution that corresponds to the change of the cooling rate is clearly visible .",
    "since the cooling rate is larger for the one white dwarf population , there is an increase of the number of white dwarfs produced in this region . as it can be noted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] the density of massive white dwarfs is remarkably lower when considering the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite since it predicts less massive white dwarfs . in the rest of cases",
    "the white dwarf mass distributions are approximately coincident in this region .",
    "in this work we have revisited the initial - final mass relationship and discussed it in a comprehensive manner . with this purpose",
    ", we have re - evaluated the available data in the literature , mainly based on open clusters , that are currently being used to define the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship .",
    "we have used the atmospheric parameters , total ages and metallicities reported in the literature and followed the procedure described in @xcite to derive the initial and final masses of these white dwarfs .",
    "thanks to these data and our own work based on common proper motion pairs we have been able to collect a very heterogeneous sample of white dwarfs , covering a wide range of ages and metallicites .",
    "most importantly , with this study we have covered the range of initial masses from @xmath123 to @xmath0 , which was poorly covered until recently @xcite .",
    "the extension of the initial - final mass relationship to the low - mass end is important since we are now studying the most populated region of initial masses according to the initial mass function of salpeter , and this means that we are also reproducing the well - established peak of the field white dwarf mass distribution @xcite .",
    "as discussed previously , for each cluster the results present an intrinsic mass spread , which may indicate that mass loss could depend more on individual stellar properties than on a global mechanism .",
    "thus , mass - loss processes could even be a stochastic phenomenon @xcite , being thus impossible to reproduce with models .",
    "another explanation for the spread of masses found for each cluster could lie on the fact that we do not know the internal composition of the white dwarfs in our sample , and we are using cooling sequences that have fixed values for the c / o ratio at the core and most importantly , fixed thicknesses of the h and he envelopes which may not be appropriate to describe the cooling of individual white dwarfs in some cases .",
    "this fact could affect the cooling times derived in approximately 10 per cent at very low luminosities @xcite .",
    "since there is no compelling reason to justify the use of a more sophisticated relationship , we have performed a weighted least - squares linear fit of these data , and from a detailed analysis we have found that there is no correlation in this sample between the final masses and metallicity .",
    "we have also given some clues on the dependence of the initial - final mass relationship on other parameters , such as rotation and magnetism .",
    "in the case of rotation , we have probably found the first evidence that rotation may have in stellar evolution , corroborating that when the progenitor is a fast rotating star , the resulting white dwarf is more massive , in agreement with the study of @xcite . among our sample",
    "there are two magnetic white dwarfs with rather different magnetic fields .",
    "the masses derived in both cases are also clearly different , being more massive the one with stronger magnetic field .",
    "this indicates that the intensity of the magnetic field might be related to the mass of the white dwarf produced .",
    "however , given the lack of information on other possible magnetic white dwarfs belonging to this sample , our results are not conclusive enough to assess the impact that magnetic fields may have in the structure of white dwarfs .",
    "in the second part of this work we have tested the initial - final mass relationship by studying its effect on the luminosity function and mass distribution of white dwarfs . for this purpose",
    "we have used different stellar evolutionary inputs ( stellar tracks and initial - final mass relationships ) .",
    "we have also computed the luminosity function of massive white dwarfs in order to evaluate the impact of the initial - final mass relationship . we have noted some differences between the theoretical luminosity functions , obtaining a clear dependence on the considered initial - final mass relationship , as expected . from a comparison of our results with the observational data from the palomar green survey we have always obtained a reasonable fit when the range of masses was constrained to @xmath124 , except when using the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed assuming a constant star formation rate , but we have also computed the luminosity functions considering an exponentially decreasing star formation rate . we have shown that the production of massive white dwarfs is dependent on the assumed star formation rate , since in the latter case the density of massive white dwarfs drops considerably . given the presently available observational data , any attempt to discern which initial - final mass relationship better fits the data is not feasible . however , our results favor an initial - final mass relationship that produces more massive white dwarfs than the relation of @xcite .",
    "this is an important finding , since the initial - final mass relationship of @xcite is the most commonly used relationship for computing the theoretical white dwarf luminosity function .    in the case of the white dwarf mass distribution",
    "we have obtained more conclusive results . from a comparison of our results with the observational data available from both the pg survey @xcite and the sdss @xcite we have noted that the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship derived in this work is the one that better fits the central peak of the mass distribution , being in this way very representative of the white dwarf population . on the contrary , the agreement with the observational data is rather poor when the relations of @xcite and @xcite are considered .",
    "the study carried out in this work evidences the necessity of increasing the number of high quality observations of white dwarfs belonging to stellar clusters , or common proper motion pairs , or to any system that may allow the determination of their total ages and original metallicities with accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , this increase in the observational data should be accompanied by refined theoretical studies of the initial - final mass relationship .",

    "<S> the initial - final mass relationship connects the mass of a white dwarf with the mass of its progenitor in the main - sequence . </S>",
    "<S> although this function is of fundamental importance to several fields in modern astrophysics , it is not well constrained either from the theoretical or the observational points of view . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we revise the present semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship by re - evaluating the available data . the distribution obtained from grouping all our results </S>",
    "<S> presents a considerable dispersion , which is larger than the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out a weighted least - squares linear fit of these data and a careful analysis to give some clues on the dependence of this relationship on some parameters such as metallicity or rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship arising from our study covers the range of initial masses from 1.0 to @xmath0 , including in this way the low - mass domain , poorly studied until recently . finally , we have also performed a test of the initial - final mass relationship by studying its effect on the luminosity function and on the mass distribution of white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by using different initial - final mass relationships from the literature , including the expression derived in this work , and comparing the results obtained with the observational data from the palomar green survey and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the semi - empirical initial - final mass relationship derived here gives results in good agreement with the observational data , especially in the case of the white dwarf mass distribution .    </S>",
