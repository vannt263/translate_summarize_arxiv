    "the symmetric ( homogeneous ) jack polynomials are relevant in the study of the quantum many - body wave functions . in particular , fractional quantum hall states of particles in the lowest landau levels are described by such polynomials @xcite .",
    "pioneered by laughlin @xcite , the theoretical study of the fractional quantum hall states use multi - variable polynomials @xcite describing the full many - body state of the interacting electrons on a plane or on a sphere ( in the case of the sphere , the polynomials appear after stereographic projection ) . the special polynomials that are relevant in this context are not general solutions of the true eigenvalue problem involving the coulomb interaction but they are constructed to be adiabatically related to the true eigenstates .",
    "the most famous example is the laughlin wave function which is the cube of the vandermonde determinant @xmath1 in the variables representing the particles .",
    "it is known to be a good approximation of the true state of electrons for the lowest landau level with filling factor @xmath2 .",
    "another interesting and celebrated example is the moore - read pfaffian @xcite @xmath3 which is one of the candidates to approximate the system for the filling factor @xmath4 and is the polynomial of smallest degree belonging to the kernel of the operator which forbids three particles to be in the same place @xmath5 this operator can be naturally generalized to operators which forbid @xmath6 particles in the same place , the lowest degree polynomials in its kernel provide other examples of wave - functions called read - rezayi @xcite states : @xmath7 this family of wave functions is composed with multivariate symmetric polynomials with some additional vanishing conditions , namely wheel conditions .",
    "these polynomials , whose study was pioneered by feigin , jimbo , miwa and mukhin , are proved to belong to a family of jack polynomials with negative rational parameter @xcite .",
    "following the notations of bernevig and haldane @xcite , these polynomials depend upon a parameter @xmath8 and a configuration of occupation numbers @xmath9 $ ] . to recover the standard notation of symmetric functions @xcite ,",
    "the set of occupations defines a decreasing partition @xmath10 $ ] of the number @xmath11 of particles .",
    "the partition @xmath12 corresponding to the vector @xmath9 $ ] is such that @xmath13 is the multiplicity of the number @xmath14 in @xmath12 .",
    "the relevant wave functions belong to the kernel of the differential operators @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the number of flux quanta . in the case of the sphere , through the stereographic projection , the natural action of the @xmath17 rotations on the quantum states is translated in an action of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "one of the authors ( j .- g.l . ) with th .",
    "jolicur@xcite described a family of jack polynomials belonging in the kernel of @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , they investigate a @xmath0-deformation of the problem involving macdonald polynomials @xcite .",
    "+ bernevig and haldane @xcite identified @xmath21-clustering properties of some wave functions which relate the functions with @xmath22 variables with those with @xmath23 by a factorization formula of the kind : @xmath24 in particular , this is the case for the read - rezayi states : @xmath25 furthermore , bernevig and haldane @xcite showed the connection between the read - rezayi states and staircase jack polynomials @xmath26 : @xmath27}(x).\\ ] ] the link between jack polynomials and quantum hall states was proven by b. estienne _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "recently , baratta and forrester @xcite proved that staircase jack polynomials for some negative rational parameter satisfy the clustering conditions .",
    "more specifically , they stated the result in terms of macdonald polynomials and recovered the property as a limit case .",
    "in the same paper , they conjectured very interesting identities for rectangular partitions ( the initial case of staircase with only one step ) : @xmath28 where @xmath8 is a certain negative rational number .",
    "the aim of our paper is to prove this conjecture by using some other families of macdonald polynomials .",
    "indeed , we will use four families of jack / macdonald polynomials : symmetric homogeneous , nonsymmetric homogeneous , shifted symmetric , shifted nonsymmetric .",
    "the macdonald polynomials are a two - parameter deformation of the jack polynomials which can be used to finely understand equalities involving jack polynomials .",
    "this is due to the fact that they appear in the representation theory of the double affine hecke algebra ( the jack polynomials are a degenerated version which involves the algebra of the symmetric group ) . furthermore they admit a physical interpretation as the eigenfunctions of the macdonald - ruijsenaars operator @xmath29 which is a relativistic version of quantum calogero - moser system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related to the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "one approach to developing a theory of orthogonal polynomials of several variables of classical type led to symmetric and nonsymmetric jack polynomials .",
    "the associated mechanism involves the symmetric group and young tableaux . just as the theory of hypergeometric series",
    "is extended to basic hypergeometric series , the theory of jack polynomials is extended by the macdonald polynomials . here",
    "the symmetric group is replaced by its hecke algebra .",
    "the orthogonality of the polynomials comes from their realization as eigenfunctions of a certain set of commuting operators .",
    "generally these polynomials have coefficients which are rational functions of the parameters @xmath36 , assumed not to be roots of unity .",
    "later a further generalization was developed , namely the theory of shifted macdonald polynomials , which are nonhomogeneous polynomials defined by the property of vanishing on certain points , corresponding to so - called spectral vectors .",
    "this vanishing property leads to expressions of the polynomials as products of linear factors in various special cases .",
    "it turns out that for special values of the form @xmath37 for positive integers @xmath38 , a shifted macdonald polynomial collapses to its highest degree term , in which case , it agrees with an ordinary homogeneous macdonald polynomial .",
    "the label of the polynomial has to satisfy certain restrictions for this to be possible .",
    "these parameter values result in the polynomials being of singular  type . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the rectangular polynomials , meaning those whose leading term is of the form @xmath39 .",
    "our results provide factorizations which are interpreted as clustering properties .",
    "the paper itself starts with an overview of the four different types of macdonald polynomials ( shifted , ordinary , symmetric , nonsymmetric ) and the algebraic structure of the associated operations .",
    "the technical machinery comprises tableaux , adjacent transpositions , raising operators , and the yang - baxter graph .",
    "then there is a presentation of the binomial formulae of knop and sahi which show how to expand nonhomogeneous macdonald polynomials in terms of homogeneous ones .",
    "these series are then specialized to the rectangular versions and this leads to the proofs of our main results .",
    "these all concern the case of @xmath11 variables with @xmath40 and the parameters satisfying @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 for the symmetric type and @xmath43 for the nonsymmetric type ) but no such relation with smaller exponents . in closing",
    "there is a discussion of future research in the direction of polynomials of staircase type ; this phrase refers to the pictorial representation of the label of the polynomial , for example @xmath44 .",
    "macdonald polynomials are special functions which are involved in the representation theory of the affine hecke algebra .",
    "this paper is devoted to the case of the symmetric group ( type @xmath45 ) . up",
    "to normalization macdonald polynomials are defined to be the simultaneous eigenfunctions of some operators which are a @xmath0-deformation of the cherednik operators .",
    "we study four variants of these polynomials : symmetric , nonsymmetric , shifted symmetric and shifted nonsymmetric .",
    "symmetric macdonald polynomials are indexed by decreasing partitions @xmath12 whilst the nonsymmetric ones are indexed by vectors @xmath46 . in the aim to simplify the expression arising in the computation ,",
