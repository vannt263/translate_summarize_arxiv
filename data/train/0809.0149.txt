    "in the field of atom interferometry , the improving sensitivity of inertial sensors  @xcite is paving the way for many new applications in geophysics , navigation and tests of fundamental physics . most of these experiments are based on raman transitions  @xcite to realize beamsplitters and mirrors , which manipulate the atomic wave - packets . among others ,",
    "this technique has the advantage of an internal state labelling of the exit ports of the interferometer  @xcite , enable an efficient detection methods .",
    "moreover , the atoms spend most of the time in free fall , with very small and calculable interactions with the environment .",
    "the inertial forces are then determined by the relative displacement of the atomic sample with respect to the equiphases of the laser beams , which realise a very accurate and stable ruler .",
    "this makes this technique suitable for high precision measurements , as required for instance for inertial sensors and for the determination of fundamental constants  @xcite .    a limit to the accuracy and",
    "the long term stability of these sensors comes from wave - front distortions of the laser beams .",
    "this wave - front distortion shift appears directly on the signal of an interferometer when the atoms experience different wave - fronts at each raman pulse .",
    "this effect thus depends on the actual trajectories of the atoms , so that a precise control of the initial position , velocity and temperature of the atomic clouds is required  @xcite .",
    "a convenient technique to reduce this bias is to minimize the number of optical components in the shaping of the two raman laser beams and by implementing them in a retro - reflected geometry  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "as long as the two beams travel together , wave - front aberrations are identical for the two beams and thus have no influence on their phase difference .",
    "this geometry also provides an efficient way to use the * k * reversal technique , which allows to diffract the atomic wavepackets in one or the opposite direction and thus to separate effects of many major systematic errors such as gradients of magnetic fields or light shifts  @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this geometry arises from the presence of off - resonant raman transitions , which induce a light shift on the resonant raman transition and thus a phase shift of the atom interferometer .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate this effect called two photon light shift ( tpls )  @xcite .",
    "we first show that the tpls arises from several off - resonant transitions and evaluate each contribution .",
    "we then derive the impact onto the phase of an atom interferometer and use our gravimeter and gyroscope - accelerometer for quantitative comparisons .",
    "in particular we measure the systematic shifts and we investigate the influence on the long term stability .",
    "the study demonstrates that the precise control of experimental parameters , in particular the raman laser intensities and polarisations , is needed to reduce the influence of this effect for such interferometers .",
    ") , cross the experiment and are reflected by a mirror , crossing twice a second quater - wave plate .",
    "the wave - plates are set in such a way that counter - propagating raman transitions are allowed but co - propagating raman transitions are forbidden.,width=321 ]    the two experiments are using different alkali - metal atoms : @xmath0rb in the case of the gravimeter and @xmath1cs in the case of the gyroscope . as hyperfine structures , transition selection rules and raman laser setups are similar ( see figure  [ schema ] ) , their results can be compared easily .",
    "the raman transitions couple the two hyperfine ground states of the alkaline atom ( labelled @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) via an intermediate state ( labelled @xmath4 ) and two lasers with frequencies ( labelled @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) detuned by @xmath7 on the red of the @xmath8 line . during the interferometer sequence",
    ", a bias magnetic field is applied along the direction of propagation of the raman laser beam to lift the degeneracy of the magnetic sublevel manifold .",
    "the two raman lasers are overlapped with orthogonal linear polarisations and delivered within the same polarisation maintaining optical fiber to the vacuum chamber .",
    "after the fiber , the raman beams pass through a quarter - wave plate to convert the initial linear polarisations into circular polarisations , noted @xmath9 for the raman laser at the frequency @xmath5 and @xmath10 for the orthogonal polarisation at @xmath6 .",
    "these beams are then retro - reflected through a quarter - wave plate to rotate the polarisation of each beam into its orthogonal polarisation ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .    for @xmath13 to @xmath13 transitions ,",
    "there are two pairs of beams ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , which can drive counter - propagating raman transitions with effective wave - vectors @xmath16 .",
    "then , the ground state @xmath17 is coupled with the excited state @xmath18 by the pair of raman laser ( @xmath19 ) and to the excited state @xmath20 with the pair of raman laser ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we use the doppler effect to lift the degeneracy between the two resonance conditions . indeed , if the atoms have a velocity in the direction of propagation of the raman lasers , the doppler shifts are of opposite sign for the two counter - propagating transitions .",
    "the resonance condition for each of these couplings is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the hyperfine transition frequency , @xmath24 is the recoil energy and @xmath25 the doppler shift due to the atomic velocity @xmath26 in the reference frame of the apparatus .",
    "consequently , the detuning between the two resonances is @xmath27 , therefore we can discriminate between the two transitions when the doppler shift is large enough compared to the linewidth of the raman transition .",
    "this linewidth is characterised by the effective rabi frequency @xmath28 , which depends on the product of the two raman lasers intensities and inversely to the raman detuning @xmath7  @xcite .    in this first part",
    ", we use the gyroscope - accelerometer experiment described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the experiment has been performed with a cloud of cold caesium atoms ( 1.2 @xmath29 ) prepared initially in the @xmath30 state .",
    "the atoms are launched at 2.4 m.s@xmath31 with an angle of @xmath32 with respect to the vertical direction .",
    "the raman lasers are implemented in the horizontal plane with a @xmath33 angle with the normal of the atomic flight direction .",
    "thus , to select only one raman transition for the interferometer , the frequency difference between the two raman lasers can be tuned to be resonant with either the @xmath34 or the @xmath35 transition .    ) .",
    "the data have been recorded with laser parameters corresponding to a @xmath36 pulse of 135 @xmath37s duration .",
    "lines ( 1,1 ) correspond to the two counter - propagating transitions , line 2 to the copropagating transition between the two @xmath13 states and lines 3 to the copropagating magnetic sensitive transitions.,width=302 ]    figure [ spectre ] shows the transition probability as a function of the detuning of the raman transition with respect to the hyperfine transition frequency .",
    "one can identify the two velocity selective counter - propagation transitions ( labelled 1 and 1 ) , whose widths reflect the velocity distribution of the atomic cloud .",
    "in addition to the counter - propagating transitions , we observe transitions due to residual co - propagating raman coupling , also detuned from resonance by a doppler shift ( lines 2 , 3 and 3 ) . when the frequency difference of the raman lasers is tuned to be resonant with one of the counter - propagating transitions , the second counter - propagating transition and the co - propagating ones induce a light shift ( tpls ) on the selected raman transition used for the interferometer .",
    "the tpls is the differential shift between the two atomic levels corresponding to the atomic states @xmath17 and @xmath38 involved in the atomic interferometer .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath17 is shifted of @xmath39 by the off - resonant @xmath40 transition detuned by @xmath41 ( eq .  [ epg ] ) , while the energy of the state @xmath38 is shifted of @xmath42 by the off - resonant @xmath43 transition detuned by @xmath44 ( eq .  [ epe ] ) .",
    "the two levels are shifted in opposite directions as illustrated in figure  [ couplages ] , here for the case of a raman transition resonant with @xmath45 .     and",
    "@xmath46 involved in the atomic interferometer .",
    "the two states are coupled together through the selected raman transition ( + * * k * * in this particular case ) . but each state is also coupled to an other one , through an off - resonant raman transition of opposite wave - vector.,width=321 ]    tpls corrections are calculated from fourth order perturbation theory . in the case of our system , the level shifts @xmath39 and @xmath42 for a @xmath47 interferometer are given by : @xmath48 where @xmath28 is the effective rabi frequency corresponding to counter - propagating raman transitions .",
    "thus , the shift of the resonance condition depends on the sign of direction of the selected raman laser pair ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , quadratically on the rabi frequency and inversely to the doppler detuning :    @xmath49 & =   \\frac{\\omega_\\mathrm{eff}^2}{\\pm 8 \\omega_\\mathrm{d}}+\\frac{\\omega_\\mathrm{eff}^2}{4 ( \\pm 2 \\omega_\\mathrm{d}+4 \\omega_\\mathrm{r } ) } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the frequency shift is measured from fits of the spectrum lines , as displayed in figure [ spectre ] , with different raman intensities ( @xmath50 is proportional to the product of the intensity of the two lasers ) .",
    "note that we discriminate it from the shifts independent of @xmath51 , like quadratic zeeman effect or ac stark shift , by alternating measurements @xmath34 and @xmath35 , leading to a differential determination of the effect .",
    "the difference in the resonance condition @xmath52 depends only on the tpls and the doppler effect .",
    "the doppler effect does not depend on the rabi frequency and can be determined by extrapolating @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "the results of these measurements are displayed in figure [ tpls ] as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the curve clearly shows the quadratic dependence of the frequency shift with @xmath28 . for this experimental configuration",
    "the doppler shift was 85 khz , and the value of @xmath55 for the largest @xmath28 ( @xmath56 khz at the center of the beam ) is 2.1 khz in good agreement with the expected 2.4 khz .",
    "the laser beams have a gaussian shape , with a 15 mm waist ( radius at @xmath57 in intensity ) . in order to evaluate the phase shift ,",
    "we first measure the tpls for different atomic positions by scanning the resonance along their trajectory .",
    "as the raman beam are horizontal , the doppler shift is constant for the three pulses and the tpls varies only with the raman laser intensity .",
    "figure  [ tplsposition ] displays the measured tpls , proportional to the laser intensity , which follows exactly the gaussian profile of the laser beams .          in an ideal experiment , with perfect circular polarization and a raman detuning @xmath7 large compared to the hyperfine structure of the intermediate state ( 201 mhz in the case of the caesium atom ) , co -",
    "propagating transitions are forbidden . in a real experiment , with imperfect polarization and/or finite raman detuning , co - propagating transitions are slightly allowed , and will lead to additional tpls .",
    "imperfect polarization leads to a residual combination of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the co - propagating beams and allows coupling between @xmath60 states .",
    "as the momentum exchanged @xmath61 , the doppler and recoil effect are negligible and the resonance condition is @xmath62 ( line 2 of figure [ spectre ] ) . the rabi frequency corresponding to the transition @xmath63 is determined experimentally using the residual co - propagating transition probability , @xmath64 at full raman laser power .",
    "it gives @xmath65 , which can be explained by an error of linear polarization of one of the raman laser of 2% in power .",
    "the detuning of this transition , compared to the two counter - propagating transitions , depends on the doppler and recoil shift : @xmath66 for @xmath67 khz and @xmath68 khz we find an effect due to this coupling smaller than 100 hz .      the second source of residual co - propagating transitions stems from the coupling of @xmath70 by the co - propagating raman laser pairs ( @xmath71,@xmath72 ) and ( @xmath73,@xmath74 ) .",
    "because of the hyperfine splitting in the intermediate state , there are two paths for the raman transition .",
    "both transitions interfere destructively when the detuning compared to the intermediate state @xmath7 is larger than the hyperfine splitting of the intermediate state , and so in this case the transition strength is zero .",
    "however , in our experimental set up , with @xmath75 mhz and the @xmath76 mhz the ratio between the rabi frequency of counter - propagating transitions @xmath28 and the rabi frequency of the co - propagating @xmath77 transition @xmath78 is 6.1 , leading to a transition probability of 6.4 @xmath79 in good agreement with the experimental value ( see figure  [ spectre ] ) .",
    "these transition resonance conditions depend on the magnetic field amplitude as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 khz / g for caesium . with a calculation similar to the one used to obtain eq.[nuls2cp ] ,",
    "we deduce the two photon light shifts @xmath82 induced by the magnetically sensitive transitions for the @xmath47 case to be :    @xmath83    the first term in eq .",
    "[ nuls2b ] is due to the coupling with @xmath84 whereas the second term is induced by the coupling with @xmath85 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "[ nuls2b ] that a residual magnetic contribution appears in the half difference and creates a magnetic sensitivity in addition to the standard quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "this contribution to the two photon light shift is measured by changing the bias field in the raman interaction zone .",
    "using the differential method previously described , we show in figure [ tpls_b ] the variation of the total tpls with the bias field .",
    "the resonance around @xmath86 mg corresponds to the case where a magnetic co - propagating transition and the counter - propagating transition are resonant simultaneously .",
    "previous measurements have been performed with a 31 mg magnetic field bias .",
    "in the following we will consider interferometers constituted of three raman pulses in a @xmath87 sequence . if the tpls is constant during the interferometer it is equivalent to a fixed frequency shift of the raman transition . in that case",
    ", it is well known that no phase shift is introduced in the interferometer . on the contrary",
    ", a fluctuation of the tpls during the interferometer sequence leads to a phase shift given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the sensitivity function of the atom interferometer , defined in @xcite .      in the case where the interaction pulses are short enough that one can neglect the variation of the tpls during the pulses , and that the area of first and last pulse fulfils the @xmath90 condition ,",
    "the two - photon interferometer phase shift can be approximated by :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the tpls and the rabi frequencies of the i - th pulse , respectively .",
    "one might notice that the frequency shift during the @xmath36 pulse does not contribute to the interferometer phase shift .",
    "moreover , as all components of the tpls , counter - propagating and co - propagating terms , increase as the square of the rabi frequencies , the interferometer phase shift scales linearly with the raman laser power .    in the limit where the co - propagating transitions",
    "are negligible ( perfect polarization and very large raman detuning ) and the dominant source of tpls is due to the counter - propagating transition , the phase shift of the interferometer can be simplified as :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the doppler shift for the i - th pulse .",
    "more generally , the interferometer phase shift can be calculated when the @xmath97 pulse condition is no longer fulfilled .",
    "this appears when the rabi frequency drifts due to changes in power or polarization of the raman lasers .",
    "generalising the formalism of the sensitivity function to the case where @xmath96 allows deriving the interferometer phase shift : @xmath98                           & & -\\frac{\\delta\\omega^{(3)}_\\mathrm{tpls}}{\\omega^{(3)}_\\mathrm{eff}}\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\omega^{(3)}_\\mathrm{eff}\\tau^{(3)}}{2}\\right ) \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] usually , the rabi frequencies and pulse durations can be taken equal for the first and the last pulses ; the expression of the interferometer shift is then : @xmath99 as before , for a dominant counter - propagating transition , the previous expression can be simplified to : @xmath100    an other aspect of the influence of the tpls on the atomic phase shift concerns the stability of the experiment versus the experimental parameters fluctuations , in particular the raman laser power . as",
    "rabi frequency fluctuations are small in relative values ( typically smaller than 10 % ) , we can develop eq .",
    "[ tppsgeneral3 ] to first order in @xmath101 close to the usual conditions @xmath90 and find :    @xmath102    similar calculations may be derived to extract the dependance on the duration of the pulse or the doppler detuning .",
    "as the stability of the latter parameters is much better controlled in cold atom interferometers , no measurable influence on the short term stability of the interferometer is expected .",
    "we first consider the case of the gravimeter developed at syrte and described in detail in  @xcite . in this compact experimental set - up ,",
    "cold @xmath103 atoms are trapped in a 3d mot in 60 ms and further cooled during a brief optical molasses phase before being released by switching off the cooling lasers . during their free fall over a few centimetres ,",
    "the interferometer is created by driving the raman laser in the vertical direction , with pulses separated by free evolution times of @xmath104 ms .",
    "the first raman pulse occurs 17 ms after releasing the atoms .",
    "the doppler shift at the first pulse is thus relatively small , about 400 khz , and gets large , about 3 mhz , for the last pulse . with a rabi frequency of 40 khz",
    ", this leads to a tpls of about 22 mrad for counter - propagating transition . following the method of paragraph [ copro ]",
    ", we find a 11 mrad for co - propagating ones .",
    "this corresponds to a large shift for the gravity measurement of about @xmath105 .        to measure the bias on the atomic interferometer phase due to tpls",
    ", we exploit its dependence with the rabi frequency .",
    "the principle of this measurement is based on a differential method , where one performs an alternating sequence of measurements of the interferometer phase with two different rabi frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath106 , but keeping the areas of the pulses constant by changing the duration of the pulses @xmath107 .",
    "the rabi frequency is modulated with the power of the raman lasers . in practice ,",
    "the differential measurement is performed by alternating sequences of measurements with four different configurations : ( @xmath108 ) , ( @xmath109 ) , ( @xmath110 ) and ( @xmath111 ) . after averaging for 5 minutes ,",
    "we extract the difference of the tpls between the two rabi frequencies with an uncertainty below 1 mrad .",
    "this measurement was repeated for various @xmath106 , keeping @xmath28 fixed .",
    "the phase differences are displayed in figure  [ shiftgravi ] in according to the ratio of the rabi frequency @xmath112 .",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the linear dependence of the phase shift with the rabi frequency .",
    "the fit of the data allows to extract a 32 mrad shift , in very good agreement with the expected value ( 33 mrad ) , deduced from eq .",
    "deviations from the linear behavior and discrepancies ( up to @xmath113 ) between different measurements that correspond to the same ratio can not be explained by uncontrolled fluctuations in the rabi frequencies , as the simultaneous monitoring of the laser intensities showed stability at the per cent level during the course of the measurements .",
    "we demonstrated that these fluctuations were correlated with changes of the polarization of the raman beams , which modulate the contribution to the phase shift of the undesired co - propagating transitions .",
    "the line corresponds to the calculated shift.,width=321 ]    we perform a complementary measurement by changing the duration of the first and last pulse simultaneously , while keeping @xmath28 constant .",
    "the acquisition is performed with a similar differential method than previously , but now alternating between different pulse durations and a pulse duration of 6 @xmath114 , when the @xmath97 pulse condition is fulfilled .",
    "the data are then shifted by the bias deduced from previous measurements with @xmath115 @xmath114 ( result of figure  [ shiftgravi ] ) and displayed in figure  [ shiftvstau ] .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ tppsgeneral2 ] , the fit of the data gives a rabi frequency of 39 khz , in very good agreement with the expected value ( 42 khz ) .",
    "a small deviation appears for long pulse durations when the areas of each of the two pulses is close to @xmath36 .    in the case of our gravimeter , where cold atoms are dropped from rest",
    ", the tpls is very large , almost two orders of magnitude above the pursued accuracy . in principle",
    ", this effect can be measured accurately by alternating measurements with different rabi frequencies .",
    "but , it seems desirable to decrease the effect by operating with lower rabi frequencies , the drawback being an increased velocity selectivity of the raman pulses . a more stringent velocity selection , or smaller temperatures ,",
    "are then required in order to preserve a good fringe contrast . in the case of a fountain gravimeter , where the atoms are launched upwards at a few m / s ,",
    "the doppler shift at the first and last pulse is much larger , considerably reducing this effect . for the parameters of the stanford gravimeter @xcite ( long pulse duration of 80 @xmath37s and time between pulses of 160 ms )",
    ", we find a phase shift of 0.8 mrad , which corresponds to @xmath116 .      in the case of the gyro - accelerometer , the mean velocity of the wave - packet is not collinear with the effective raman wave vector .",
    "consequently , the atomic phase shift measured with the interferometer is sensitive to the rotation rate * @xmath117 * in addition to the acceleration * a*. as in the case of the gravimeter , the atomic phase is shifted by the tpls and by other systematics ( labelled @xmath118 ) , for instance the phase shift induced by the laser wave - front distortions  @xcite .",
    "the total phase shift is expressed by :    @xmath119    our gyroscope - accelerometer uses a double interferometer with two atomic clouds following the same trajectory but with opposite directions to discriminate between acceleration and rotation phase shifts . moreover ,",
    "our experiment is designed to measure different axis of rotation and acceleration according to direction of propagation of the raman laser beams .",
    "we will illustrate the impact of the tpls on the interferometer in the configuration where the raman lasers are directed along the vertical direction .",
    "acquisitions have been recorded for a total interaction time between the first and the last pulse of 40 ms . to remove drifts from other sources ,",
    "the phase shift is measured in a differential way with respect to the maximum rabi frequency available at the location of the @xmath36/2 pulses ( 33 khz ) .",
    "the line shows the calculated shift for acceleration signal.,width=321 ]    the measurement is realized in the same way than for the gravimeter experiment by comparing atomic phases with high and low rabi frequency , changing the raman laser power but keeping the pulse duration constant to 7.6  @xmath37s . in order to enhance the tpls signal",
    "we decrease the time between pulses to 20 ms .",
    "indeed , the doppler effect is reduced and the available laser power on the side of the gaussian laser profile is increased .",
    "the first pulse occurs 15 ms before the apogee and the third 25 ms after the apogee , corresponding respectively to a doppler shift of about @xmath120344  khz and @xmath121574  khz .",
    "the rabi frequency for each pulse is approximately 33  khz , then the tpls expected from eq.[tpps ] is about 38 mrad for each interferometer .",
    "as this shift is similar for the two interferometers when the two atomic clouds perfectly overlap and experiment the same tpls , it bias the acceleration signal only . figure  [ shiftgyro40 ] displays the variation of the acceleration and rotation signals with the rabi frequency . acceleration shift ( squares )",
    "varies in a good agreement with expected shift ( continuous curve ) calculated from eq .",
    "[ tppsgeneral ] .",
    "rotation shift ( circles ) shows no dependance on the rabi frequency and illustrates that the rejection from the acceleration signal is efficient .",
    "nevertheless , fluctuations from expected behaviour are clearly resolved and repeatable .",
    "we attribute these deviations to wave - front distortions of the raman laser beams . indeed ,",
    "when the atomic trajectories do no perfectly overlap , a residual bias appears on the rotation due to unperfected cancellation .",
    "this bias depends on the details of the wave - front distortions weighted by the actual atomic cloud distributions , and is modified when the rabi frequency is changed . in the usual conditions , with interrogation time of 80  ms , the acceleration shift is reduced to about 12 mrad thanks to the increase of the doppler shift and reduction of the rabi frequency on the side of the gaussian raman beams .",
    "we finally estimate the impact of the raman laser power fluctuations on the stability of the rotation signal in usual conditions ( interrogation time of 80 ms ) .",
    "we performed a complementary measurement by recording the interferometer signal and the raman laser power in the same time when applying a modulation of the laser powers of 10@xmath79 .",
    "the modulation is applied by attenuating the radio - frequency signal sends to the acousto - optic modulator used to generate the raman pulses .",
    "the power of the lasers was recorded during the third pulse thanks to a photodiode measuring the intensity on the edge of the laser beams .",
    "we found a small dependance of the rotation signal on the power fluctuation of @xmath122 rad.s@xmath31/@xmath79 , which can limit the long term stability of the gyroscope .",
    "as no dependance was expected , we attribute it again to non perfect superimposition of the two atomic clouds trajectories , leading to a different rabi frequencies experienced by the two clouds .",
    "we have shown that the use of retro - reflected raman lasers in atom interferometers induces off - resonant raman transitions , which have to be taken into account in order to achieve best accuracy and stability of interferometers .",
    "we have first quantitatively evaluated the effect on the resonance condition for each off - resonant line : the other counter - propagating transition , which can not be avoided in the retro - reflected design , and co - propagating transitions arising mainly from imperfections in the polarisation .",
    "then , we have measured the impact of this two photon light shift on the phase of two atom interferometers : a gravimeter and a gyroscope .",
    "in particular , we show that this shift is an important source of systematic errors for acceleration measurements .",
    "nevertheless , it can be measured accurately by modulating the raman laser power and/or the pulse durations .",
    "our study has also shown that it can impact the stability of the two sensors if the polarization and/or the power of the raman lasers fluctuate .",
    "the tpls appears as a drawback of using retro - reflected raman laser beams .",
    "but , as it can be well controlled , it does not reduce the benefit from this geometry , whose key advantage is to drastically limit the bias due to wave - front aberrations , which is larger and more difficult to extrapolate to zero .",
    "this study can be extended to other two photon transitions ( like bragg transitions ) and to other possible polarization configurations ( when using linear instead of circular polarizations ) , when using the doppler effect to select the transition .",
    "if the signal is generated from the subtraction of the phase shifts of two independent atomic clouds , e.g. gradiometers or gyroscopes , perfect common mode rejection , is required to suppress this effect . in our case this means a perfect overlap of atomic trajectories .",
    "finally , the two photon light shift can be drastically reduced by increasing the doppler effect and/or using colder atoms , allowing to reduce the rabi frequency during the raman pulses . by contrast , for set - up with intrinsic small doppler effect , as for space applications  @xcite",

    "<S> we study the influence of off - resonant two photon transitions on high precision measurements with atom interferometers based on stimulated raman transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these resonances induce a two photon light shift on the resonant raman condition . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of this effect is investigated in two highly sensitive experiments : a gravimeter and a gyroscope - accelerometer . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it can lead to significant systematic phase shifts , which have to be taken into account in order to achieve best performances in term of accuracy and stability . </S>"
