    "there is presently a growing body of circumstantial evidence linking some long - duration gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) with afterglows to the explosions of massive stars .",
    "supernovae ( sn ) or supernova - like features have been identified in seven afterglows although some of these could be light echoes from dust clouds @xcite .",
    "the afterglows of six other grbs have been interpreted in terms of a wind - like ambient medium as expected around a massive star at the end of its life .",
    "however these are often equally well explained by a collimated flow in a uniform medium .",
    "x - ray lines have been detected with moderate confidence in about half the afterglows for which they were investigated @xcite ; however , the data analysis has been questioned ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if real , these are most easily explained by dense material surrounding the burst engine , suggesting a stellar origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have recently derived beaming angles for a number of grbs from observations of their afterglows .",
    "these authors derive gamma - ray energies reminiscent of supernovae : roughly @xmath0 erg for the observed lobes of grbs .",
    "similar results were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "clear evidence that grbs occur very close to massive star formation would be almost as conclusive as a sn signature in an individual grb .",
    "several grb afterglows show evidence for high column densities ( 980703 and 980329 ; @xcite ) or high local gas densities ( 000926 and 980519 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , both of which connote star - forming regions .",
    "likewise , the intrinsic extinction of grb 000926 is characteristic of a galaxy disk @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the observed locations within hosts imply a tight correlation between grbs and stellar populations , considered too tight @xcite to be matched by merging neutron stars .",
    "note however that the locations of merging neutron star pairs depends on their uncertain distribution of natal kicks .",
    "if grbs are a rare byproduct of star formation , rapidly star - forming galaxies should be over - represented as grb hosts . in optical light host galaxies",
    "tend to look ordinary compared to contemporaries in the hubble deep field , but [ ne iii ] and [ o ii ] and infrared observations often indicate elevated star formation rates @xcite .",
    "at least eight afterglows have been associated with starburst or interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the association between long - duration grbs and sne is tentative ( and applies only to the long - duration bursts for which afterglows are observed ) , the above evidence warrants a careful evaluation .",
    "there are two ways a sn can create a grb .",
    "@xcite predicted that gamma rays might be produced in the very fastest , outermost ejecta of an ordinary supernova explosion .",
    "this proposal was recently revived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the grb ( 980425 ) most compellingly associated with a sn ( 1998bw ) is likely to be the result of trans - relativistic sn ejecta colliding with a stellar wind ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their model ,",
    "as conjectured by @xcite , sn 1998bw was spherically symmetric or mildly asymmetric , and produced the grb in an external shock .",
    "scaled - up versions of this model could produce external shock grbs , at the expense of vast amounts ( @xmath1 erg ) of energy in nonrelativistic ejecta .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have argued that most grbs require internal emission ( e.g. , by internal shocks ) within unsteady ultrarelativistic winds or jets , as originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "the arguments for internal emission are strongest for rapidly - fluctuating cosmological bursts with hard spectra , those least resembling grb 980425 ; also , see @xcite for arguments in support of external shocks .",
    "i shall assume for the purposes of this investigation that cosmological grbs involve internal emission within optically thin , ultrarelativistic outflows .",
    "for this to result from a sn , a jet must emanate from a star s core and pierce its envelope  shedding the baryons in its path  prior to producing the gamma rays observed at earth",
    ". such a jetlike explosion is the conventional model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) for a supernova origin of cosmological grbs .",
    "the goal of this paper will be to develop analytical models for the phase of this latter model in which a jet , already created by the stellar core , must traverse the envelope and shove aside material in its path .",
    "these models , which are complementary to numerical simulations @xcite , are meant to elucidate under what conditions the hypothesis of a stellar origin is viable for the observed grbs . in   [ inside star ] and [ envelopeconstraints ] i assume that jets travel ballistically within their stars ; this allows one to place strict constraints on stellar envelopes . in  [ widening ] this assumption is reconsidered .",
    "it is shown that a phase in which the jet is hot , pressure confined , and mixing with its environs would have interesting consequences .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] sketches the typical masses and radii of the stellar grb progenitor candidates considered in this paper . in general , those that retain an outer envelope ( e.g. , supergiants ) have quite large radii ( @xmath2 ) at the time of core collapse , whereas those depleted in hydrogen due to winds or binary interaction ( e.g. , those that have been through a wolf - rayet phase ) are quite compact ( @xmath3 ) . among post - wolf - rayet stars , those containing helium ( `` he wolf - rayets '' on the plot ) are less compact than their he - depleted peers ( `` c / o wolf - rayets '' ) .    very massive objects ( vmos )",
    "might have formed at high redshift due to the difficulty of cooling in the absence of metals and thus the large jeans mass in primordial gas .",
    "vmos may also form today in rare conditions .",
    "those initially more massive than @xmath4 die when their cores collapse to black holes , and are candidates for producing grbs ; @xcite discuss their evolution .",
    "again , the pre - collapse radii of these stars depend on their mass loss .",
    "if present , their h envelope is quite diffuse ( see * ? ? ?",
    "otherwise the remaining convective core is very compact at the point of collapse .",
    "in addition to winds and binary mass transfer , vmos may shed their envelopes in a super - eddington phase during helium core contraction .",
    "lone vmos are thought to retain h envelopes if they are formed from sufficiently low - metallicity gas ( although this is uncertain ; * ? ? ?",
    "the `` supranova '' model of @xcite posits that a sn explosion produces a rapidly spinning neutron star massive enough to collapse after shedding its angular momentum @xcite along with @xmath5 erg of rotational energy .",
    "the object collapses to a black hole with an accretion torus , firing a jet through the pulsar s wind nebula and its sheath of stellar ejecta .",
    "because of the short viscous times of such tori , this model is most appropriate for short grbs rather than the long bursts for which there is evidence of a sn connection .",
    "also , we will see in  [ envelopeconstraints ] that the expanding stellar ejecta would prevent the production of a grb entirely , unless it has either become thompson optically thin or has been cleared aside by the breakout of the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the latter is possible in this model , because the pulsar spindown energy exceeds the typical kinetic energy of sn ejecta .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss a scenario in which the stellar core collapse leading to a grb results from the coalescence of a helium wolf - rayet star with a compact companion .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue that binary mergers are likely to dominate the production stars whose cores collapse to black holes accreting through a disk .",
    "progenitors created in this fashion will typically be stripped of their outer envelopes , hence compact .",
    "however the stripped envelope poses a potential barrier to jet propagation , as in the supranova model , unless it is strictly confined to the equator of the system or has expanded to the point of being optically thin .    in sections [ s : freefalltimes ] and [ s :",
    "pressureconf ] i examine the properties of stellar cores at the point of collapse .",
    "for this i shall assume that collapse sets in at the oxygen ignition temperature , @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consider the progress of a relativistic jet outward from a star s core through the stellar envelope .",
    "schematically , three distinct regions develop : the propagating jet ; the _ head _ of the jet , where jet material impacts the stellar envelope , and a _ cocoon _ consisting of shocked jet and shocked ambient material .",
    "these are familiar components from the theory of radio galaxies @xcite ; see figure [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "stellar envelopes pose a problem for the propagation of grb jets only if they have not collapsed prior to the launching of the jet .",
    "the stellar envelope s collapse timescale is greater ( probably by a factor of at least a few ) than its free - fall time @xmath7 . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "i compare stellar free - fall times with the intrinsic durations of grbs for several possible redshifts . only the very densest progenitors",
    ", the cores of very massive objects ( @xmath8)^{1/4}$ ] s at oxygen ignition ) and helium depleted post - wolf - rayet stars ( @xmath9 s ) could plausibly collapse entirely in the durations of the longest grbs , and then only at low redshift . in all other cases a stellar envelope remains to impede grb jets .      for stellar core collapse to successfully produce a cosmological grb",
    ", it must emit a jet that clears the stellar envelope from the observer s line of sight to the core .",
    "this is required if the jet is to achieve high lorentz factors and if its internal shocks are to be unobscured by overlying material .",
    "this can not occur if the lorentz factor of the jet head , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the head s velocity ) , exceeds the inverse beaming angle @xmath12 .",
    "if it did , then the jet head would be causally disconnected from its edges and would behave like a spherical blastwave @xcite . in this case",
    "essentially no material would escape sideways to form the cocoon .",
    "if instead @xmath13 then there is ample opportunity for shocked jet and envelope material to flow sideways and inflate the cocoon , so a successful grb requires @xmath14 observers of grb afterglows often identify an achromatic break in the light curve with the deceleration of the swept up shell from @xmath15 to @xmath13 @xcite . in order for this to be possible ,",
    "the head must have satisfied @xmath16 while it was still being driven forward by the jet ( prior to its deceleration ) . condition ( [ gamthetawind ] ) only applies to grbs whose afterglows exhibit such a break in their afterglows .",
    "the expansion velocity of the jet head is given to a very good approximation by the balance of jet and ambient ram pressures ( momentum fluxes ) in the frame of the jet head .",
    "this approximation is most accurate when ambient material is cast aside into the cocoon , as is the case if equation ( [ gamthetaenv ] ) is satisfied .",
    "ram pressure balance means @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relative four - velocity between the jet and its head , @xmath19 is the four - velocity of the head into the ambient medium , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are density , pressure , and enthalpy ( @xmath23 is total comoving energy density ) , and the subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to jet and ambient material . as @xmath26 in a stellar envelope @xmath27 to a good approximation and @xmath28 can be ignored on the right - hand side . to leading order in @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be ignored on the left . for a stationary ambient medium ,",
    "these approximations give @xmath31 where @xmath32 the second equality , which holds to leading order in @xmath29 , is derived by noting that the kinetic plus internal energy density of the jet , evaluated in the lab frame , is @xmath33 ; its isotropic luminosity @xmath34 is this quantity times @xmath35 ; and the mass per unit length of the ambient medium is @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the radius and the true jet luminosity is @xmath38 .",
    "the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 implied by equation ( [ vhead ] ) takes simple limits in two regimes . if @xmath41 , then the reverse shock into the jet is nonrelativistic @xcite and @xmath42 .",
    "this case is physically unattainable within a star and is achieved outside only if the ambient density is extremely low . in the opposite limit of a relativistic reverse shock , @xmath43 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , @xmath44 is useful in determining the observer s time @xmath45 for the jet head to expand to radius @xmath37 if viewed at redshift @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath47 , @xmath48 for both non - relativistic and relativistic jet heads , so long as @xmath49 . in presupernova envelopes and stellar winds",
    "@xmath50 is relatively constant , and since @xmath34 is likely to vary slowly @xmath44 can be approximated with its average value .",
    "more generally , one might know how @xmath34 varies as a function of @xmath51 ( which is also @xmath52 at the origin , @xmath53 ) .",
    "if one also knows @xmath54 ( e.g , from a model of the star and its collapse ) , then equation ( [ tobs ] ) integrates to @xmath55 giving @xmath56 implicitly .",
    "the jet cocoon is the region containing spent jet material and shocked ambient material .",
    "its extent is equal to that of the jet , but its width is determined either by pressure balance with the surrounding gas , if there is time for this to be achieved , or else by the expansion of a lateral shock into the envelope .",
    "the latter case holds so long as it predicts a cocoon pressure @xmath57 in excess of the hydrostatic pressure or collapse ram pressure @xmath28 in its environment .",
    "let us first consider the case of an adiabatic cocoon whose pressure exceeds that of its surroundings , and check this assumption in ",
    "[ s : pressureconf ] .",
    "let us also restrict attention to the case where the head velocity is subrelativistic ( @xmath58 , eq . [ [ limitsofgammah ] ] ) , in which case the cocoon pressure @xmath57 is roughly constant away from the jet head .",
    "the cocoon created by a jet of constant opening angle expands self - similarly so long as its width @xmath59 expands in proportion to its extent @xmath37 , and so long as no other size scales affect its structure . under these conditions",
    ", numerical simulations can determine cocoon structures exactly .",
    "however , analytical estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while not as accurate , elucidate how cocoon properties scale with @xmath44 and @xmath60 .",
    "the cocoon expands nonrelativistically in a direction normal to its surface at the velocity @xmath61 given by @xmath62 if @xmath63 is evaluated at the point where the cocoon is widest , the normal direction is sideways and thus @xmath64 .",
    "the pressure @xmath57 is related to the energy @xmath65 deposited in the cocoon and the cocoon volume @xmath66 through @xmath67 ( an overestimate , as part of @xmath65 is kinetic ) . if a cocoon of length @xmath37 and width @xmath59 is idealized as a cone , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in equation ( [ betacprelim ] ) .",
    "but , since @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "now , @xmath65 is the energy emitted in time to catch up with the jet head at radius @xmath37 .",
    "( after breakout , @xmath65 is available to drive an observable outflow and possibly a precursor : see @xcite and  [ breakout ] . )",

[ [ limitsofgammah ] ] ) , and @xmath79 for a collimated jet .      equation ( [ betacsoln ] ) assumes that the length of the cocoon is set by the advance of the jet head ; this requires @xmath80 .",
    "if this condition is violated , the cocoon expands around the jet and develops into a roughly spherical blastwave ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "i assumed a nonrelativistic head in deriving equation ( [ l : no - bw : l<1 ] ) ; however there is nothing to suggest that relativistic jet heads can be swallowed by their cocoons .",
    "a successful grb requires that stellar envelope material be cleared from the path of the jet so it can sustain @xmath91 at @xmath92 1 au where internal shocks are thought to form .",
    "a jet - cocoon structure is required for this : a spherical blastwave would not accomplish it . for this reason grbs must satisfy @xmath93 within the stellar envelope ( eqs . [ [ gamthetaenv ] ] ,  [ [ limitsofgammah ] ] , and [ [ l : no - bw : l<1 ] ] ) so that a cocoon forms but does not overcome the jet . of these limits on @xmath44 ,",
    "only the lower need be considered because @xmath94 for any reasonable combination of opening angle and stellar model .",
    "one can use equation ( [ l : no - bw : l<1 ] ) in equation ( [ ein - from - l - tobs ] ) to eliminate either @xmath95 , which gives a lower limit on @xmath75 , or to eliminate @xmath96 , which gives an upper limit on @xmath75 . in terms of the total energy per lobe @xmath97 deposited in the stellar envelope ,",
    "the formation of a cocoon rather than a spherical blastwave implies @xmath98 a spherical blastwave is not sensitive to the site of energy injection , whether at a jet head or near the collapsing core , and for this reason the upper bound applies to energy from _ any _ source that is entrained in the stellar envelope before the jet breaks out of the star .",
    "note that the lower bound implies that @xmath97 must be at least a fraction @xmath99 of the rest energy of the envelope in the jet s path , @xmath100 .",
    "one further and very important constraint derives from the durations of grbs . in the internal - shock model , fluctuating gamma - ray emission reflects variability in the central engine and persists only while this engine is running @xcite .",
    "define @xmath101 as the observed duration of a grb , including any precursor but excluding its afterglow . in the collapsar model ,",
    "this must be preceded by the cocoon phase during which the jet crosses the stellar envelope .",
    "the central engine must therefore be active for at least @xmath102 in the observer s frame .",
    "it is unlikely  though not impossible  for @xmath101 to be much shorter than @xmath103 , for this would require the central engine to shut off just as its effects become observable .",
    "so @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the efficiency with which the jet s kinetic luminosity is converted into gamma rays in the observed band .",
    "the second inequality derives from the first as long as the jet s luminosity is relatively constant .",
    "i have assumed a constant luminosity jet up to this point , but grbs are often observed to fluctuate significantly in intensity on very short timescales .",
    "how should the above results be adjusted for jet variability ?",
    "first , note that the process producing gamma rays ( e.g. , internal shocks ) is likely to accentuate the intrinsic variability of the source .",
    "second , the observed propagation speed of the jet head , @xmath106 , is equal to @xmath107 ( eq . [ [ tobs ] ] ) .",
    "a fluctuating jet thus progresses more slowly than a steady jet of the same mean luminosity .",
    "if one uses the average value of @xmath44 to constrain a star s mass and radius by requiring that @xmath103 is not long compared to the observed burst ( eqs .",
    "[ [ tobs - tgamma - rstar ] ] above and [ [ r - m - l - tobs ] ] below ) , then this constraint is only tightened if one accounts for variability .",
    "similarly , a variable jet deposits more energy per radius than a steady jet of the same mean luminosity ; this only tightens the constraints derived by requiring a jet - cocoon structure ( eq .",
    "[ [ l : no - bw : l<1 ] ] ) .",
    "to apply the above constraints to stellar progenitors for grbs , observed quantities must be related to the the parameters of equations ( [ l : no - bw : l<1 ] ) , ( [ einconstraint ] ) , and ( [ tobs - tgamma - rstar ] ) .",
    "this is possible for cases where , in addition to @xmath101 , the redshift @xmath46 and jet opening angle @xmath60 have been derived from afterglow observations . to construct @xmath44",
    "one requires the isotropic ( equivalent ) kinetic luminosity @xmath34 and the mass per unit radius @xmath50 in the environment .",
    "i adopt for grbs energy , luminosity , and duration the following definitions : @xmath108 ; and @xmath109 . here",
    "the isotropic gamma ray energy is @xmath110 , and @xmath105 is the average efficiency factor relating the gamma - ray energy to the total ( kinetic , poynting , and photon ) luminosity of the jet .",
    "the net energy @xmath111 and luminosity @xmath112 represent only the approaching jet , which presumably has a counterjet .",
    "a key assumption employed throughout this section is that the @xmath113-ray half opening angle @xmath60 is equal to the jet s half opening angle while it crosses the outer stellar envelope .",
    "this is essentially the same as the assumption that the jet is ballistic ( rather than hot and pressure - confined ) at that point ; this assumption is revisited in  [ widening ] .",
    "i assume the value of @xmath60 derived from afterglow observations @xcite can be used to characterize the jet as it crosses the outer stellar envelope and emerges from the star .",
    "the above definitions identify @xmath114 as the mean value ( energy @xmath115 in source - frame duration @xmath116 ) .",
    "this is somewhat arbitrary , since grbs are highly variable ; see  [ s : variability ] for justification .    for numerical evaluations",
    "i use either @xmath117 erg / s , or @xmath118 erg .",
    "the former is a characteristic value for grbs and can be observed without determining @xmath60 .",
    "the latter is motivated by @xcite s result that @xmath119 for ten grbs whose @xmath60 could be determined .    in a stellar envelope",
    "the radial average value of @xmath50 is @xmath120 , the ratio of envelope mass to stellar radius . indeed , many presupernova envelopes have density profiles close to @xmath121 ( @xcite ) , for which @xmath50 is constant at its average value .",

    "a progenitor model passes the timing constraint if it lies to the left of its burst .",
    "most of the bursts plotted are consistent with @xmath133 ; for none of them does this limit exceed @xmath134 .",

    "these results appear broadly compatible with the work of @xcite , and indicate the potential importance of this route to pressure confinement .",
    "second , consider the mixing of ambient material into the jet during a pressure - confined phase .",
    "nonadiabatic mixing can be described by imagining relativistically hot jet material flowing though a uniform channel of fixed cross - sectional area @xmath289 . at some initial time",

    "first , the heuristic argument that @xmath270 would be forgotten is correct : the effective value of @xmath296 increases monotonically in non - adiabatic jet expansion , because @xmath262 increases whereas @xmath40 decreases ( or if @xmath297 , stays constant ) .",
    "this in turn implies that pressure confinement is extended somewhat by mixing .",
    "secondly , mixing forces the nondimensional jet parameters to trace a characteristic trajectory that whose implications would be observable .",
    "recall that the final opening angle @xmath233 is the inverse of @xmath40 if the jet is confined .",
    "also , final lorentz factor @xmath185 is equal to the ratio of the jet s luminosity to its mass flux , @xmath298 in terms of these dimensionless parameters , equation ( [ mixing1 ] ) can be restated @xmath299 where @xmath300 represents the fractional mass per unit length mixed in .",

    "as shown in figure [ figmix ] , mixing trajectories do cross through reasonable values of @xmath185 and @xmath233 .",
    "does this mean that these jet parameters arise from mixing ?",

    "if @xmath307 , adiabatic expansion and mixing both act to bring @xmath308 .",
    "if @xmath309 , the adiabatic tendency for @xmath40 to increase is counterbalanced by the nonadiabatic decrease in @xmath40 . this makes the mixing attractor solution a probable one for the end state of jets that are pressure - confined at some stage .",

    "why would a jet change from pressure - confined to ballistic ?",
    "this could occur in a couple ways .",

    "however this appears to require the ambient density to drop to a near vacuum , implying it would not occur spontaneously within a star .",
    "alternatively , the jet could become internally nonrelativistic ( @xmath319 ) . as we have seen",
    ", adiabatic evolution works in this direction whereas crossing shocks and non - adiabatic mixing oppose it .",
    "the transition would then depend on the specifics of jet propagation and mixing .",
    "finally , the jet could be confined by internal magnetic stresses , a possibility highlighted by the @xmath113-ray polarization discovered by @xcite , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "jet pressure confinement would naturally lead to time - dependent jet properties , since the confining pressure evolves during the cocoon phase and after breakout .",
    "crossing shocks and mixing with ambient material are also unlikely to be steady processes .",
    "one would expect evolution during grbs as a result ; however , no trends are discernible except for changes in pulse asymmetry @xcite .    apart from this contraindication , it is difficult to judge whether pressure confinement persists across entire stellar radii .",
    "if so , then the constraints on stellar envelopes in   [ inside star ] and [ envelopeconstraints ] are relaxed .",
    "numerical simulations can potentially solve detailed questions such as this one .",
    "however , caution should be used in interpreting them , because of the many decades separating the launching radius from the stellar radius .",
    "this paper constrains possible stellar progenitors for grbs by requiring that jets of grb - like luminosities and durations can clear a path for themselves in the star s envelope prior to producing gamma rays .",
    "of all the possible progenitors , only the compact carbon - oxygen post - wolf - rayet stars ( sn ic progenitors ) and the bare cores of very massive objects can plausibly collapse in the durations of long grbs at low redshift (  [ s : freefalltimes ] , figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . in more extended stars , the outer stellar envelope remains to impede the progress of the jet , and it is likely to violate observational constraint .",
    "therefore , i conclude that grbs with sn progentiors come primarily from type ic or vmo - core events .",
    "type ib is not thoroughly ruled out by this work , but type ii ( supergiant stars ) are .",
    "the most stringent constraint on a stellar envelope arises from the requirement that the jet can traverse it in an observed time not much longer than the duration of the grb . under the assumption of a ballistic rather than a pressure - confined jet ,",
    "this constraint is independent of the inferred opening angle of the burst , and ( given an observed fluence and duration ) depends on its inferred comoving distance rather than its luminosity distance .",
    "this makes it insensitive to an uncertainty in redshift .",
    "given the luminosities and durations of grbs ( regardless of their redshift ; fig .",
    "[ figtiming ] ) , only post - wolf - rayet stars and vmo cores are compact enough to satisfy this criterion .",
    "the variability - luminosity correlation discussed by @xcite and @xcite allows this constraint to be applied to a large number of bursts in the batse catalog ( figure [ figtiming ] ) .",
    "only a few are compatible with blue supergiant progenitors ; red supergiants and vmos with envelopes are ruled out .",
    "also ruled out is the `` supranova '' model of @xcite ( a supernova followed by a grb ) , unless the sn ejecta are optically thin by the time of the grb , or unless the pulsar nebula is energetic enough to clear them aside .",
    "post - wolf - rayet stars have been favored among stellar grb progenitors since the work of @xcite , on the basis that their compact envelopes delay the grb jet breakout the least .",
    "the above constraint quantifies and strengthens this conclusion , and relates it to the observed properties of grbs rather than those of a specific model for the central engine .    for ballistic jets ,",
    "an additional constraint arises from the requirement that the grb jet cocoon should not overtake its driving jet and produce a spherical explosion .",
    "this is generally not as restrictive as the constraint from burst durations discussed above , but it does become important for jets with opening angles exceeding @xmath320 ( figure [ figcocoon ] ) .",
    "vmo cores , being the most compact , are the progenitors most likely to be ruled out this way if they have not collapsed prior to the grb .",
    "the requirement of a jet - cocoon structure also gives interesting upper and lower bounds on the energy entrained in the stellar envelope during the phase of jet propagation ( eq . [ [ einconstraint ] ] ) .",
    "this energy is stored in the jet cocoon and is available to drive a `` dirty '' fireball @xcite of expanding cocoon material after the jet breaks out .",
    "the breakout phenomenon is itself a candidate for producing a transient , as may have happened in sn 1998bw to produce grb 980425 . in section [ breakout ] it",
    "is calculated how much kinetic energy is channeled into relativistic envelope ejecta during a jet s breakout , by matching the propagation law for the jet s terminal shock onto the relativistic shock and post - shock acceleration behavior described by @xcite .",
    "i find the energy of this ejecta to be small compared to that of the burst .",
    "@xcite have recently discussed how the upscattering of photons from the shocked envelope by the jet may produce a precursor of hard gamma rays ; however , note that this is reduced in importance for the compact stellar progenitors favored by the timing constraints . @xcite have suggested breakout ejecta as the origin of short , hard bursts ; however their estimate of the energy is at odds with that calculated here .",
    "if the gamma - ray photons are not able to clear away a stellar wind in the region around the star in the manner described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , then the presence of this wind places an upper limit on the jet lorentz factor .",
    "this limit arises in the internal shock model for grb emission because the presence of the external shock limits the distance within which internal shocks can form .",
    "the equivalent limit has been presented previously for uniform ambient media @xcite ; however , for a sufficiently dense stellar wind it can conflict with the lower limits on jet lorentz factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig418 ] illustrates the above criteria for the specific case of grb 000418 , assuming a ballistic jet with @xmath321 .",
    "its seven - second duration is briefer even than the free - fall times of vmo cores .",
    "because of its large opening angle ( @xmath322 ; * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , a jet of its inferred luminosity could cross nothing more extended than the most compact of wolf - rayet stars in the grb duration .",
    "i conclude from this that it came either from a compact carbon - oxygen wolf - rayet star , or from a vmo core that managed to produce a grb of briefer duration than its free - fall time , or that it did not have a supernova origin .",

    "pressure confinement of jets provides a way for grb hosts to evade the constraints on stellar envelopes listed above for ballistic jets .",
    "this occurs because , for a given @xmath113-ray opening angle , confined jets are narrower and more intense than their ballistic counterparts .",
    "the computational results of @xcite and @xcite correspond to pressure - confined jets . in ",
    "[ adiabatics ] it was shown that jets that do not mix with their environs can not remain pressure - confined ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "simulations that do not resolve the jets launching scale may not observe this effect , however .",
    "mixing of jet and envelope (  [ ss : mixing ] ) is capable of sustaining a pressure - confined state .",
    "intriguingly , mixing of jet and envelope imprints on the jet a tight correlation ( the `` mixing attractor '' of eq . [ [ mixingattractor ] ] and figure [ figmix ] ) between its lorentz factor and energy per unit mass .",
    "this leads to a correlation between final opening angle and lorentz factor , which in turn may be related to the lag - luminosity and variability - luminosity correlations observed in burst catalogs .",
    "excessive mixing , however , has the effect of filtering rapid fluctuations from jets .",

    "<S> i constrain a possible supernova origin for gamma - ray bursts by modeling the dynamical interaction between a relativistic jet and a stellar envelope surrounding it . the delay in observer s time introduced by the jet traversing the envelope should not be long compared to the duration of gamma - ray emission ; also , the jet should not be swallowed by a spherical explosion it powers . </S>",
    "<S> the only stellar progenitors that comfortably satisfy these constraints , if one assumes that jets move ballistically within their host stars , are compact carbon - oxygen or helium post - wolf - rayet stars ( type ic or ib supernovae ) ; type ii supernovae are ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> notably , very massive stars do not appear capable of producing the observed bursts at any redshift unless the stellar envelope is stripped prior to collapse . </S>",

    "<S> these envelope constraints could conceivably be circumvented if jets are laterally pressure - confined while traversing the outer stellar envelope . </S>",
    "<S> if so , jets responsible for observed grbs must either have been launched from a region several hundred kilometers wide , or have mixed with envelope material as they travel </S>",
