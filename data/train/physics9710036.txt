    "the field of a charged particle at rest in an inertial frame is a static coulomb field which falls as @xmath0 in the standard spherical coordinate system .",
    "the field of a charge , moving with uniform velocity , can be obtained by lorentz transforming the coulomb field ; this field also falls as inverse square of the distance .",
    "the situation changes dramatically for a charged particle which is moving with non zero acceleration .",
    "the field now has a piece which falls only as @xmath1 , usually called the radiation field . for a field which decreases as @xmath1 ,",
    "the energy flux varies as @xmath0 implying that the same amount of energy flows through spheres of different radii at sufficiently large distances from the charge .",
    "because of this reason , the radiation fields acquire a life of their own and the entire phenomena of electromagnetic radiation hinges on this feature . due to the continuous transfer of energy from the charged particle to large distances",
    ", there will be a damping force acting on the charged particle which is usually called the radiation reaction force .",
    "the derivation of radiation reaction force is conceptually and operationally quite complicated and the expression  obtained originally by dirac ( see [ 4]) has no simple intuitive description .",
    "we analyse these issues from a novel point of view in this paper which throws light on the conceptual and mathematical issues involved in this problem .",
    "the analysis is motivated by the following issue : maxwell s equations are not only lorentz invariant but can also be written in a generally covariant manner . given a charged particle moving in some arbitrary trajectory ,",
    "it is always possible to construct a proper coordinate system for such a charged particle .",
    "in such a coordinate system , the charge will be at rest for all times but the background metric will be non minkowskian and  in general ",
    "time dependent .",
    "the maxwell s equations in this coordinate system will correspond to that of a _ stationary _ charge located in a non trivial ( and in general time dependent ) metric .",
    "the solution to maxwell s equation in this frame receives time dependent contributions _ not _ because of the motion of charged particles but because of the non trivial nature of the _ background _ metric .",
    "but we know that , for internal consistency , these solutions should transform to the standard solutions describing the field of an arbitrarily moving charged particle when we go over to the inertial frame ! this is remarkable since the time dependence and nontriviality of the _ background metric _ have to translate to the correct spatial and time dependence of the _",
    "radiation field_. further , the charged particle has to feel the radiation reaction force in the non inertial frame , even though it is at rest , due to the non triviality of the background metric .",
    "it is not intuitively obvious how these features come about and it is important to understand how the physics in the non inertial frame of the charged particle operates .",
    "we shall explore in this paper both the issues raised in the above paragraph . the key feature which emerges from our analysis",
    "is the following .",
    "the structure of the maxwell s equations dictate that the static field of a _ uniformly accelerated _ charged particle in its rest frame can be related to the field of an _ arbitrarily moving _ charged particle in the inertial frame .",
    "this connection also carries over to the computation of the self - force .",
    "it turns out that the radiation reaction force has a simple geometrical origin in the uniformly accelerating frame in which the charged particle is instantaneously at rest .",
    "the force arises due to the deviation of the trajectory of the charged particle from that of uniform acceleration and hence is proportional to the derivative of the acceleration .",
    "we shall now spell out the details of the approach we plan to follow in this paper .",
    "consider the electromagnetic field of a charge moving with a uniform velocity in an inertial frame @xmath2 .",
    "since maxwell s equations are lorentz covariant , the most natural way to calculate the field in @xmath2 is to find the field in the charge s rest frame @xmath3 and transform back to @xmath2 .",
    "let us next consider the problem of calculating the electromagnetic field of a charge which is moving _",
    "arbitrarily_. the conventional method ( see e.g. @xcite ) is to calculate the leinard - weichert potential and to differentiate it to obtain the field .",
    "however , we will show that it is possible to approach the problem differently along the following lines :    consider a charge moving with an arbitrary velocity and acceleration in an inertial frame @xmath2 . in the lorentz gauge",
    ", maxwell s equations can be written in terms of the vector potential @xmath4 and the current @xmath5 as : @xmath6 where  @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath8 because of the characteristics of the @xmath9 operator , the fields at an event @xmath10 can only depend on the trajectory of the charge at the retarded event @xmath11 , which is the point of intersection of the backward light cone drawn from @xmath10 , and the worldline of the charge @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath5 is linear in four velocity , the quantity @xmath13 , in the the right hand side of ( [ eqn : two ] ) can at most depend on @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the fields at @xmath10 can at most depend on the second derivatives at the retarted position of the charge at @xmath11 - i.e. , at most on the retarded acceleration of the charge .",
    "suppose we now change the trajectory of the charge to that of a uniformly accelerated one without changing the values of the velocity and acceleration at the retarded event @xmath11 .",
    "the field at @xmath10 , since it depends only on the velocity and acceleration at @xmath11 will still remain the same .",
    "it follows that , if we know the field at @xmath10 due to a uniformly accelerated charge with a given acceleration and velocity at @xmath11 , then we can obtain the field due to a general trajectory .",
    "thus the problem reduces to that of calculating the field of a uniformly accelerated charged particle .",
    "this is most easily done by using the fact that maxwell s equations can be written in a generally covariant manner . solving the maxwell s equations in the noninertial , rest frame of charge and transforming the field to the inertial frame ,",
    "we can obtain the field of a uniformly accelerated particle . using the argument outlined above",
    ", we can then find the field of a charged particle moving in an arbitrary trajectory .",
    "to illustrate the power of this technique , we shall directly calculate the field for arbitrary , _ rectilinear _ motion .",
    "( the general case is a straightforward extension , and is treated in appendix c ) .",
    "the real power of this formalism , however , lies in calculating the field in the _ infinitesimal neighbourhood _ of the accelerating charge .",
    "the general expression for the field in the neighbourhood of an accelerating charge , found by dirac , is a fairly involved expression , and good deal of labour is required to compute it .",
    "our formalism involves computing it in the instantaneous coaccelerating frame of the charge , in which the first and second derivatives of the position of the charge vanish .",
    "the only dynamical contribution to the near field comes from the the third derivative , which  as we shall see  leads to the radiation reaction term .",
    "this , along with the static terms , neatly transforms into expression obtained by dirac in the inertial frame .",
    "in addition , a novel interpretation for radiation reaction emerges in the accelerated frame .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section 3 , we obtain the electromagnetic field of a uniformly accelerated charge .",
    "this is done by solving maxwell s equations in the rest frame of the charged particle ( which is a noninertial frame ) and transforming to the inertial frame . in section 4",
    ", we use this result to obtain the field of an arbitrarily moving charged particle .",
    "this result is obtained by the procedure outlined above .",
    "section 5 uses the same formalism to obtain the field in the neighbourhood of the charged particle , thereby obtaining the radiation reaction term .",
    "the last section summarises the results of the paper .",
    "since the key idea involves working with a uniformly accelerated frame , we shall review the coordinate transformation connecting the minkowski frame to the rindler frame and collect together the necessary formulas .",
    "consider a charge moving with uniform acceleration along the z - axis of an inertial frame @xmath2 with the coordinate system @xmath15 .",
    "the trajectory of the charge is given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the proper acceleration of the charge , and @xmath18 is its proper time . the world line ,    @xmath19    is a hyperbola .",
    "referring to figure 1 , one can see that this charge can influence regions @xmath20 and @xmath21 of spacetime , which lie along the forward light cone of the charge s trajectory but not the regions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "let us now fix a proper , fermi - walker transported coordinate system @xmath24 to the accelerating charge and call it frame @xmath25 .",
    "separate transformations are defined from @xmath2 to @xmath25 for regions @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in region",
    "@xmath20 , we take @xmath26 and in region @xmath21 we take @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 are mapped to themselves . the spacetime interval ,",
    "both in regions @xmath20 and @xmath21 is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the range @xmath32 $ ] covers region @xmath20 , and @xmath33 $ ] covers region @xmath21 . in these coordinates",
    ", the charge is at rest , at @xmath34 .",
    "since the metric is same for the transformations defined by equations ( [ eqn : five ] ) and ( [ eqn : six ] ) , we can solve maxwell s equations in the background metric of ( [ eqn : seven ] ) and transform separately in regions @xmath20 and @xmath21 to get the fields in the frame @xmath2 .",
    "let us next obtain the solutions to the maxwell s equations in the noninertial rindler frame .",
    "the generally covariant form of maxwell s equations are : @xmath35 with @xmath36 the current is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is coordinate of the charged particle in the accelerated frame and the dirac delta function is defined to be @xmath39 for a point charge at @xmath40 . since the charge is at rest , @xmath41 .",
    "correspondingly , we can take @xmath42=0 with all time derivatives vanishing .",
    "hence the only relevant components of the field tensor are @xmath43 expressing the field tensor in terms of the potential , we get the equation satisfied by @xmath44 : @xmath45 this equation has a simple , closed form solution which can be obtained by direct integration of ( [ eqn : sixteen ] ) for @xmath46 and matching the boundary condition at @xmath47 @xmath48 ( an alternative derivation of this solution is given in appendix a. ) also , as mentioned earlier , @xmath49=0 implying that there are no magnetic fields .",
    "let us next compute the electric field corresponding to this potential . in an inertial frame , @xmath50 , can all be interpreted as defining the electric field ( apart from difference in signs ) .",
    "however , in the metric defined by equation ( [ eqn : seven ] ) , these components have different spatial dependence due to raising and lowering by @xmath51 , which is not constant .",
    "so , in order to define the _ physical _ electric field , we go back to the basic definition of electric field as the `` electromagnetic force per unit charge , experienced by a charge at rest '' .",
    "the contravariant electromagnetic force vector is : @xmath52 which for a charge at rest gives the electric field @xmath53 using this in equations ( [ eqn : fifteen ] ) , we get the electric field components : @xmath54)}{{\\xi}^3 } ; \\quad   e^{\\rho}=\\frac{(2ge{\\zeta}_0){\\rho}{\\sqrt{2g{\\zeta}}}}{{\\xi}^3 } ; \\quad e^{\\phi}=0 \\label{eqn : nineteen}\\ ] ] where @xmath55    there are some interesting features which are worth noting about this field . to simplify the analysis",
    "let us transform from the coordinates @xmath56 to @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",

    "the electric field is along @xmath62 axis and has the value @xmath63 this is finite and is equivalent to having a charge density @xmath64 at the apparent horizon ( this point was earlier noted in reference [ 2 ] ) . _",
    "note that this result is coordinate dependent_. the field @xmath65 , in the coordinates @xmath56 , _ vanishes _ at the horizon . in these coordinates , there is no charge density on the horizon .",
    "if we shift the origin of z - axis by introducing the coordinate @xmath66 , then the metric becomes @xmath67 and the electric field becomes @xmath68 @xmath69 with @xmath70 . in this form , it is clear that field is the usual coulomb field for @xmath71 .",
    "the behaviour of the field near the charge , compared to its form near the apparent horizon clearly shows the distorting effect of the background line element .",
    "we shall now use this result to obtain the fields of an arbitrarily moving change .",
    "we shall calculate the field due to a rectilinearly moving charge using the approach described in section 2 .",
    "let this charge move along the @xmath72-axis of the inertial frame @xmath2 .",

    "so , at @xmath11 , in the frame @xmath79 , the charge is instantaneously at rest without acceleration . with this construction ,",

    "this deviation , which essentially modifies the expression @xmath188 , has a purely geometrical origin in the locally co - accelerating frame .",
    "since the lowest order deviation will be proportional to the rate of change of acceleration , it is clear that the radiation reaction force should be proportional to the same ; that is , it should be proportional to the third derivative of the trajectory .    it will be of interest to see whether these results allow us to tackle the question of self - force in curved space time and to generalize the various expressions to an arbitrary curved background .",
    "we hope to address these questions in a future publication .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath189 due to a charge at rest in a uniformly accelerating frame satisfies the following equation [ see equation ( [ eqn : sixteen ] ) ] : @xmath190 we shall find a solution to this equation by studying a different , but related problem .",

    "coordinates @xmath191 , the charge is placed at @xmath192 .",
    "the metric is given by : @xmath193 maxwell s equations are seperable in these coordinates .",

    "mathematically , if we introduce a coordinate @xmath197 by : @xmath198 then we can write @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the effective surface gravity of the horizon . if we fix our origin at @xmath201 and restrict all observations perpendicular to the z - axis to a very small region , then @xmath202 . in this limit , @xmath203 giving , @xmath204 which is identical to the metric given by equation ( [ eqn : seven ] ) .    in this approximation",
    ", we are neglecting curvature of spacetime such that the horizon appears like a plane @xmath205 as in a uniformly accelerating frame .",
    "more importantly , it gives us an ansatz to find a solution to equation ( [ eqn : sixteen ] ) , by using this approximation in the expression for @xmath189 given by equation ( [ eqn : eightyfive ] ) .",
    "straightforward algebra gives : @xmath206 which is , an exact solution to equation ( [ eqn : eightytwo ] ) .",
    "consider a charge moving in an arbitrary trajectory in an inertial frame @xmath2 .",
    "as before , we construct a comoving , uniformly accelerating frame @xmath79 , in which the expression for the self - force is given by ( [ eqn : seventyfour ] ) .",
    "consider now the expression ( [ eqn : seventyfive ] ) in a frame in which @xmath207 the expression reduces to @xmath208\\ ] ] so that @xmath209 ( it is assumed that @xmath210 limit is considered ; also note that @xmath211 in this limit . )",
    "this is identical to ( [ eqn : seventyfour ] ) when we use ( [ eqn : seventyeight ] ) with @xmath212 .",
    "if one wants the expression for @xmath177 in the frame @xmath2 , all one has to do is find the expression in @xmath79 ( which is a simpler task compared to directly calculating it in the frame @xmath2 , as is normally done ) , given by equation ( [ eqn : seventyfour ] ) , transform it to the inertial frame ( to get expression ( [ eqn : eightyfive ] ) ) , and finally to transform it to @xmath2 by making a lorentz transformation .",
    "this leads to the lorentz - dirac expression , given by equation ( [ eqn : seventyfive ] ) .",
    "it is possible to express the field tensor @xmath213 produced by an arbitrarily moving charge ,",
