    "the effective acoustic properties ( speed , impedance ) depend on the material of the shell and , in particular , on its thickness @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the effective compressibility to shell thickness is a consequence of hoop stress in thin shells , which combined with the dependence of the effective density , results in the fact that thin shells have effective sound speed that is independent of thickness @xcite .",

    "the cylinders are clamped between 2 cm thick acrylonitrile - butadiene - styrene ( abs ) plates using tensioned monofilament .",
    "the plates were machined to precisely locate the top and bottom of the cylinders in the positions dictated by the design .",
    "note that an added benefit of the urethane end - caps is that they provide some level of vibration isolation between the end plates and the cylinders",
    ". one key challenge to accurately measure the performance predicted in section [ sec3 ] was to minimize the effects of the finite height of the lens and thus observe its 2d response .",
    "the associated practical difficulty encountered was in the selection and placement of the appropriate acoustic source .",
    "validation of the lens design implies the need for an axis - symmetric source pressure along the vertical axis in the 3d lens , but no such source was available to the authors nor could one be easily constructed .",
    "acoustic reciprocity , described below , was invoked to resolve this difficulty .",
    "reciprocity is a fundamental principal of quiescent acoustic media , first fully described for acoustics by rayleigh @xcite ; it states that the interchange of source and receiver will lead to the same measured acoustic field if the environment is un - perturbed . specifically , if one excites acoustic waves at some point , _ a _ , then `` the resulting velocity potential at a second point , _ b _ , is the same both in magnitude and in phase , as it would have been at _ a _ had _ b _ been the source of sound@xcite . ''",
    "applying this principal to the problem at hand , it is possible to replace the axis - symmetric source at the center of the cylindrical - to - plane wave lens with a point receiver and then measure the acoustic field at the center of the lens due to a plane wave incident from a specified radial angle . by varying the angle incidence of the plane wave , it is thus possible to construct the far - field radiation pattern expected from an axis - symmetric source placed at the center of the lens .",
    "the only remaining problem is the generation of plane waves at a specified angle of incidence .",
    "this is achieved using a spherical wave source located sufficiently far away from the lens such that the phase of the pressure field impinging on the lens aperture has variations less than 1@xmath50 across the entire frequency band of interest . for the lens geometry and frequencies considered ,",
    "this can be achieved by at least 10 m separation between the spherical source and the lens .    .",

    "the source and lens with internal hydrophone were submerged to a depth of 5.5 m with a separation distance of 10 m. the lens was attached to a column capable of angular rotation through 360@xmath50 .",
    "the source is then driven with 2 ms tone bursts from 1540 khz at 2.5 khz intervals and the time - series voltage output from the hydrophone was collected from 0 - 360@xmath50 at approximately 0.5@xmath50 intervals using a sampling frequency of 512 khz .",
    "this process was then repeated for the hydrophone without the lens as a reference and referred to as the bare hydrophone case .",

    "the results were obtained by performing post - processing of the time - series data output from the hydrophone , described next .",
    "for each angle and frequency , the steady - state portion of the tone - burst is identified through inspection of the time - domain voltage signal and a time gate is set so that only the steady state portion is considered .",
    "the magnitude of the signal at each frequency and angle combination is then found by averaging the magnitude of the complex envelope of the received voltage signal during its steady - state response .",
