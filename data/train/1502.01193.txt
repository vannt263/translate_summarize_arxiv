    "for a nonlinear partial differential equation , possessing infinitely many conservation laws indicates the equation is integrable . in the fully discrete case , multi - dimensional consistency@xcite provides a kind of strong integrability , under which and extra conditions lattice equations defined on quadrilateral were classified@xcite and discrete boussinesq(dbsq)-type equations were found@xcite as multi - component models . for these multi - dimensional consistent equations , infinitely many conservation laws were already constructed in several different ways@xcite .",
    "however , these known conservation laws are only formal ones  the nonzero boundary condition at infinity ( asymptotic behavior ) of the solutions of the considered lattice equations was neglected .    how does asymptotic behavior play roles ?",
    "a discrete conservation law is defined in the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are shift operators defined as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we request @xmath8 and @xmath9 tend to zero fast enough when @xmath10 so that @xmath11=0 $ ] and the sumation @xmath12 makes sense . as a result , @xmath12 is indenpendent of @xmath13 and represents a conserved quantity with respect to @xmath13 .    to explain more , as an example ,",
    "let us look at the lattice potential korteweg - de vries ( lpkdv ) equation@xcite , also known as h1 equation in the adler - bobenko - suris ( abs ) list@xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and lattice parameters @xmath19 for direction @xmath20 and @xmath21 for direction @xmath13 are arbitrary constants . unlike most of continuous integrable systems , @xmath22 is not a solution to the lpkdv equation .",
    "it has a simplest solution @xmath23 with a constant @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25-soliton solution has the form@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 solution is usually called a _ background _ of solitons .",
    "it has been known that most of members in the abs list and dbsq - type equations have either linear or exponential backgrounds ( cf .",
    "the nonzero background will bring difficulties in finding convergent conserved quantities . for the lpkdv equation , due to the background",
    ", the equation itself is not in a conserved form and the discrete integral of function of @xmath28 , for example , @xmath29 , does not make sense because with the background the summation is not convergent at all . with regard to discrete conservation laws , as an example ,",
    "let us take a look at the second conservation law of the lpkdv equation derived from its lax pair ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which is in the form with @xmath30 obviously , for @xmath28 defined in with the background , neither @xmath8 nor @xmath9 is asymptotic to zero when @xmath31 or @xmath32 . although one can artificially add constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 to the above @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively so that they get zero asymptotic behaviors , these constants can not be derived naturally .",
    "this is the drawback . in this letter , for the lpkdv equation , we derive its infinitely many conserved quantities of which each corresponding conserved density @xmath35 when @xmath10 and the conserved quantity @xmath36 is convergent .",
    "our approach is a by - product of the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) . in the ist",
    ", the scattering data @xmath37 ( connected with the transmission coefficient @xmath38 by @xmath39 ) is time - independent and it is asymptotically related to wave functions ( jost solutions ) in a certain way . @xmath37 can be expanded in the complex plane and coefficient of each term provides a conserved quantity ( functional ) .",
    "such an approach was first proposed by zakharov and shabat in @xcite where they derived conserved quantities for the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "later , it was applied to the ablowitz - ladik hierarchy@xcite .",
    "the approach was also used to obtain conserved quantities for the kdv equation ( see @xcite ) . however , for the fully discrete multi - dimensionally consistent lpkdv equation , particularly , @xmath28 having non - zero background , we need to reconstruct a new discrete riccati equation by using a conformal map which transforms the upper complex plane to the inside of unit circle .",
    "series solution to the riccati equation is constructed based on the analytic and asymptotic properties of jost solutions .",
    "the letter is organized as follows . in sec.[sec-2 ] we recall some necessary results in the direct scattering problem of the lpkdv equation given in @xcite . then in sec.[sec-3 ] we derive infinitely many conserved quantities for the lpkdv equation .",
    "finally , sec.[sec-4 ] is for conclusions . besides",
    ", we will revisit solutions to the riccati equation in appendix .",
    "in this section we recall some results in the ist procedure of the lpkdv equation described in @xcite .",
    "these results are necessary in our approach . throughout the paper",
    "we suppose the spacing parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the lpkdv equation has the following lax pair    [ lax - h1 ] @xmath42    one can rewrite into a scalar discrete schrdinger problem@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and we have replaced the wave function @xmath45 with @xmath46 and the spectral parameter @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "it then follows from the structure that @xmath49 this is the boundary condition for @xmath50 or @xmath28 , and we request @xmath50 falls in the space ( cf.@xcite ) @xmath51 we note that in direct scattering problem @xmath13 is treated as a constant or zero .    under the boundary condition ,",

    ".    for these conserved quantities or conserved densities , we have further results .    [ p:3 ] under the criteria given in @xcite , the conserved densities are non - trivial and not equivalent to each other .",
    "this can be proved as done in @xcite by making use of @xmath117-polynomials to calculate orders of conserved densities .    at the end of the section",
    "we note that it is not necessary to compare the conserved densities with @xmath125 which were derived in @xcite based on the series solution @xmath87 given in . here",
    "in fact , on one hand , @xmath127 are functions of @xmath128 while @xmath129 are functions of @xmath130 where @xmath131",
    ". they can not be unified . on the other hand , any series solutions to the riccati equation",
    "should agree with known analytic properties . in this sense ,",
    "the expansion is _",
    "wild_.    a further discussion on the series solutions to the riccati equation is given in appendix [ a:2 ] .",
    "we have derived infinitely many conserved quantities for the lpkdv equation . different from those known ones , these conserved quantities are convergent thanks to the zero asymptotic behaviors of conserved densities .",

    "the conformal map is employed to convert the upper @xmath94-plane to the inside unite circle of @xmath100-plane .",
    "such a spectral transformation enables us to have a new series solution of the riccati equation with respect to @xmath100 and the solution agrees with the analytic and asymptotic properties of jost solution @xmath55 .",
    "this new solution leads to desired infinitely many conserved quantities , which presented in proposition [ p:2 ] .",
    "another set of conserved quantities with respect to @xmath132 can be obtained by replacing @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "it has been seen that the derivation of conserved quantities or conservation laws for discrete systems is more complicated than continuous case .",
    "one reason is due to the obstacle of non - zero background of soliton solutions in discrete case .",
    "it is specially important to construct conserved densities which are asymptotic to zero when solutions have non - zero background .",
    "another point is riccati equation and its solutions . for the lpkdv equation",

    "we hope by the discussion of the letter we can emphasize the importance of asymptotic property and analytic property of discrete wave functions in the research of discrete systems .",
