    "low - rank matrices occur in many applications , e.g. , in signal theory , machine learning and collaborative filtering .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases it is only possible to get incomplete or indirect information of matrices . since applications usually require complete matrices in order to process data , it is necessary to recover matrices from available data . in general",
    "this is not possible .",
    "however , when matrices are of low - rank , there are efficient algorithms to accomplish this task .",
    "so far , _ low - rank matrix recovery ( lrmr ) _ is described by a minimization problem which can be solved by convex optimization programs . in this work",
    "we show how gabidulin codes can be used in order to solve the lrmr problem .",
    "_ low - rank matrix recovery ( lrmr ) _ was first defined in @xcite and can be seen as matrix - analogue of compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "the goal of lrmr is to reconstruct a matrix from incomplete or indirect observations .",
    "the problem is stated as follows : we want to recover an unknown matrix @xmath0 of lowest possible rank , where in applications @xmath1 usually is the real or complex field .",
    "therefore , we use observed measurements @xmath2 , which we obtain by applying a linear measurement operator @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "finding a solution to this problem can be specified in terms of the minimization problem @xmath6 often , in literature ( [ eqminimization ] ) is also called rank minimization problem . since this problem is np - hard ,",
    "convex relaxations are considered .",
    "most commonly used algorithms are nuclear norm minimization @xcite and iterative hard thresholding @xcite .",
    "an overview of these and other methods , theoretical guarantees and applications is given in @xcite .",
    "gabidulin codes over finite fields were introduced in @xcite , a comprehensive overview is given in @xcite . since we deal with numbers from infinite alphabets in lrmr , there is a need for gabidulin codes in characteristic zero , which we introduce according to @xcite .",
    "decoding in rank metric can be described by @xmath7 , which has a similar form as equation  .",
    "this observation suggests that it might be possible to use a rank metric decoder in order to recover a low - rank matrix and in section  [ sec : newapproach ] we will show how this can be done .",

    "this condition is always fulfilled if @xmath12 is a _",

    "we can ensure this by choosing @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath1 is a cyclotomic extension of @xmath85 of degree @xmath74 .",
