    "single domain globular proteins are mesoscopic systems that self - assemble , under folding conditions , to a compact state with definite topology . given that the folded states of proteins are only on the order of tens of angstroms ( the radius of gyration @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite where @xmath0 is the number of amino acids ) it is surprising that they undergo highly cooperative transitions from an ensemble of unfolded states to the native state @xcite . similarly , there is a wide spread in the folding times as well @xcite .",
    "the rates of folding vary by nearly nine orders of magnitude . sometime ago it was shown theoretically that the folding time , @xmath17 , should depend on @xmath0 @xcite but only recently has experimental data confirmed this prediction @xcite .",

    "careful examination @xcite . for large enough @xmath0",
    "it is likely that the folding or melting temperature itself may not be unique @xcite .",
    "although substantial variations in @xmath22 are unlikely it has already been shown that the there is a range of temperatures over which individual residues in a protein achieve their native state ordering @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the global cooperativity , as measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 ( see below for definition ) has been shown to scale as @xcite @xmath24 the surprising finding in eq .",

    "first , the exponent @xmath25 , where @xmath6 is the exponent that describes the divergence of susceptibility at the critical point for a n - component @xmath26-model with n = 0 .",
    "it follows that for proteins @xmath27 is universal .",

    "( 1 ) is only valid near the folding temperature @xmath28 . at or above @xmath28 the global conformations of the polypeptide chains as measured by @xmath29 obey the flory law , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , the unfolded character of the polypeptide chains are reflected in the thermodynamic cooperativity of the folding transition at @xmath28 .",
    "in this paper we use lattice models with side chains ( lmsc ) , off - lattice go models for 23 proteins and experimental results for a number of proteins to further confirm the theoretical predictions .",

    "there is a latent heat release at @xmath28 , at which @xmath80 can be approximated by a delta - function . in this case",
    "@xmath81 which implies that @xmath79 and the calorimetric enthalpy @xmath82 ( obtained by integrating the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath80 ) would coincide .",
    "it is logical to infer that as @xmath23 increases the ratio @xmath83 should approach unity .",
    "( 2 ) even for moderate sized proteins that undergo a two - state transition @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "it is known that the extent of cooperativity depends on external conditions as has been demonstrated for thermal denaturation of ci2 at several values of ph @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath85 for all ph values are @xmath86 .",
    "however , the variation in cooperativity of ci2 as ph varies are reflected in the changes in @xmath1 @xcite . therefore , we believe that @xmath1 , that varies in the range @xmath2 , is a better descriptor of the extent of cooperativity than @xmath85 .",
    "the latter merely tests the applicability of the two - state approximation .",
    "for the 23 go proteins listed in table i , we calculated @xmath23 from the temperature dependence of @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ hairpin_cspb_fig ] we compare the temperature dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89-hairpin ( @xmath90 ) and _ bacillus subtilis _",
    "( cpsb , @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is clear that the transition width and the amplitudes of @xmath77 obtained using go models , compare only qualitatively well with experiments . as pointed out by kaya and chan @xcite ,",
    "the simple go - like models consistently underestimate the extent of cooperativity .",
    "nevertheless , both the models and experiments show that @xmath23 increases dramatically as @xmath0 increases ( fig .",
    "[ hairpin_cspb_fig ] ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath23 with @xmath0 for the 23 proteins obtained from the simulations of go models is given in fig .",
    "[ scal_omega_fig ] . from the ln@xmath23-ln@xmath0 plot",
    "we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 for off - lattice models and lmsc , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath4 deviate from the theoretical prediction @xmath32 .",
    "we suspect that this is due to large fluctuations in the native state of polypeptide chains that are represented using minimal models",
    ". nevertheless , the results for the minimal models rule out the value of @xmath94 that is predicted for systems that undergo first order transition .",
    "the near coincidence of @xmath4 for both models show that the details of interactions are not relevant .    for the thirty four proteins ( table ii ) for which we could find thermal denaturation data",
    ", we calculated @xmath23 using the @xmath95 , and @xmath28 ( referred to as the melting temperature @xmath22 in the experimental literature ) . from the plot of ln@xmath23 versus ln@xmath0 we find that @xmath96 .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath4 , which also deviates from @xmath94 , is in much better agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the analysis of experimental data requires care because the compiled results were obtained from a number of different laboratories around the world .",
    "each laboratory uses different methods to analyze the raw experimental data which invariably lead to varying methods to estimate errors in @xmath95 and @xmath22 . to estimate the error bar for @xmath4",
    "it is important to consider the errors in the computation of @xmath23 . using the reported experimental errors in @xmath22 and @xmath95 we calculated the variance @xmath97 using the standard expression for the error propagation @xcite .",
    "the upper bound in the error in @xmath23 for the thirty four proteins is given in table ii .",
    "to provide an accurate evaluation of the errors in the exponent @xmath4 we used a weighted linear fit , in which each value of ln@xmath23 contributes to the fit with the weight proportional to its standard deviation @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous presence of stabilizing ( between hydrophobic residues ) and destabilizing interactions involving polar and charged residues in polypeptide chain renders the native state only marginally stable @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic residues enable the formation of compact structures while polar and charged residues , for whom water is a good solvent , are better accommodated by extended conformations .",
    "thus , in the folded state the average energy gain per residue ( compared to expanded states ) is @xmath98 kcal / mol ) whereas due to chain connectivity and surface area burial the loss in free energy of exposed residues is @xmath99 . because there is a large number of solvent - mediated interactions that stabilize the native state , even when @xmath0 is small , it follows from the central limit theorem that the barrier height @xmath100 , whose lower bound is the stabilizing free energy should scale as @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "a different physical picture has been used to argue that @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "both the scenarios show that the barrier to folding rates scales sublinearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of ln@xmath7 ( @xmath103 ) on @xmath0 using experimental data for 69 proteins @xcite and the simulation results for the 23 proteins is consistent with the predicted behavior that @xmath104 with @xmath14 .",
    "the correlation between the experimental results and the theoretical fit is 0.74 which is similar to the previous analysis using a set of 57 proteins @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the data can also be fit using @xmath102 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath20 using the @xmath105 fit is over an order of magnitude larger than for the @xmath106 behavior . in the absence of accurate measurements for a larger data set of proteins",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the two power laws for @xmath107 .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that there is a correlation between folding rates and @xmath108-score which can be defined as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the free energy of the native state , @xmath111 is the average free energy of the unfolded states and @xmath112 is the dispersion in the free energy of the unfolded states . from the fluctuation formula",
    "it follows that @xmath113 so that @xmath114 since @xmath115 and @xmath80 are extensive it follows that @xmath116 .",
    "this observation establishes an intrinsic connection between the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding that involves formation and rearrangement of non - covalent interactions . in an interesting recent note",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the finding @xmath101 can be interpreted in terms of @xmath117 in which @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ zscore1_eq ] ) is replaced by @xmath95 . in either case",
    ", there appears to be a thermodynamic rationale for the sublinear scaling of the folding free energy barrier .",
    "we have reexamined the dependence of the extent of cooperativity as a function of @xmath0 using lattice models with side chains , off - lattice models and experimental data on thermal denaturation .",
    "the finding that @xmath118 at @xmath119 with @xmath120 provides additional support for the earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the present work also shows that the theoretical value for @xmath4 is independent of the precise model used which implies that @xmath4 is universal .",
    "it is surprising to find such general characteristics for proteins for which specificity is often an important property . we should note that accurate value of @xmath4 and @xmath1 can only be obtained using more refined models that perhaps include desolvation penalty @xcite    in accord with a number of theoretical predictions @xcite we found that the folding free energy barrier scales only sublinearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the relatively small barrier is in accord with the marginal stability of proteins .",
    "since the barriers to global unfolding is relatively small it follows that there must be large conformational fluctuations even when the protein is in the nba .",
    "indeed , recent experiments show that such dynamical fluctuations that are localized in various regions of a monomeric protein might play an important functional role .",
    "these observations suggest that small barriers in proteins and rna @xcite might be an evolved characteristics of all natural sequences .",
