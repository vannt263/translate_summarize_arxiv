    "<S> we calculate the electric quadrupole to magnetic dipole transition ratio @xmath0 for the reaction @xmath1 in the chiral quark soliton model . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated @xmath0 ratio is in a good agreement with the very new experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain non - zero negative value for the electric quadrupole @xmath2 transition moment , which suggests an oblate deformed charge structure of the nucleon or / and the delta isobar . </S>",

    "<S> # 1#1 # 1 # 1    the ratio of electric quadrupole to magnetic dipole amplitude ( @xmath0 ) for the reaction @xmath3 is a quantity sensitive to a presence of charge deformations in the baryon structure . </S>",
    "<S> the most reliable phenomenological estimate @xmath4 so far comes from detailed analysis  @xcite of the available photoproduction data , assuming the most general @xmath5 gauge coupling and taking into account the unitary condition via watson theorem . very recently a very precise @xmath6-photoproduction experiment  @xcite has been performed at mami , mainz , which allows for a direct model - independent estimate of the ratio @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary result @xmath7  @xcite confirms the negative sign suggested from the analysis  @xcite and shows a larger @xmath0-asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this non - zero negative value is a clear indication for the presence of an oblate charge deformation in the nucleon or / and delta and as such it imposes strong constraints for the effective models of baryon structure . </S>",
    "<S> wirzba and weise have investigated the @xmath0 ratio in a modified skyrme model which includes stabilizing fourth- and sixth - order terms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they obtained values between @xmath8 and @xmath9 depending on the coupling parameters of stabilizing terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , the other related observables , namely the @xmath2 mass difference , charge radii , and the isovector magnetic moment , are not properly described .    in the present work we study @xmath0 ratio for the process @xmath10 in the chiral quark soliton model ( for review see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the simplest su(2)-version of the model with up and down quark degenerated in mass , which is based on the semibosonized nambu jona - lasinio lagrangean  @xcite : @xmath11 with auxiliary meson fields @xmath12 constrained on the chiral circle . </S>",
    "<S> the model is non - renormalizable and a finite cutoff is needed . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is treated as a parameter of the model and together with the current quark mass @xmath13 is fixed in the mesonic sector to reproduce the physical pion mass @xmath14 and the pion decay constant @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the last model parameter , the constituent quark mass @xmath16 , can be related to the empirical value of the quark condensate but actually it still leaves a broad range for @xmath16 . has to be chosen around @xmath17 mev ( see review  @xcite ) . ]    in the model the baryons appear as a bound state of @xmath18 ( number of colors ) valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea . </S>",
    "<S> since the model lacks confinement the proper way to describe the nucleon is to consider  @xcite a correlation function of two @xmath18-quark currents with nucleon quantum numbers @xmath19 at large euclidean time - separation : @xmath20 where current @xmath21 is a composite quark operator  @xcite : @xmath22 in the above path integral the quark fields are integrated out . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action includes the dirac operator @xmath23 with one - particle hamiltonian given by @xmath24    in the model the nucleonic solution is obtained in two steps . in the first step , in leading order in @xmath18 the integral over the meson fields @xmath25 in eq.([correlator ] ) is done in a saddle point approximation . to that end </S>",
    "<S> we look for a stationary localized meson configuration ( soliton ) of hedgehog structure @xmath26 which minimizes the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the soliton solution is found by solving the corresponding equations of motion in an iterative self - consistent procedure  @xcite . since the hedgehog soliton @xmath27 does not preserve the spin and isospin , as a next step we make use of the rotational zero modes to quantize it . </S>",
    "<S> it is done assuming a rotating meson hedgehog fields of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a time - dependent rotation su(2 ) matrix in the isospin space . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that for such an ansatz one can transform the effective action @xmath30 in order to separate the angular velocity matrix : @xmath31 since the angular velocity is quantized according to the canonical quantization rule , it appears as @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to consider @xmath33 as perturbation and to evaluate any observable as a perturbation series in @xmath33 which is actually an expansion in @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the path integral over @xmath29 , which appears due to the ansatz ( [ rothedg ] ) , determines the spin - flavor structure of the nucleonic solution . for </S>",
    "<S> given spin @xmath35 and isospin @xmath36 this structure can be expressed through the wigner @xmath37 function @xmath38    very recently , the nucleon electromagnetic form factors have been calculated  @xcite in this semiclassical quantization scheme up to the next to leading order in angular velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the constituent quark mass @xmath39 mev are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also noted that the @xmath40 rotational corrections improve considerably the theoretical value for the isovector magnetic moment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously it is worthily to consider in this model also the ratio @xmath0 for the process @xmath41 whose value is well settled by the recent experiment in mainz  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined  @xcite as a ratio @xmath42 of electric quadrupole amplitude @xmath43 to magnetic dipole one @xmath44 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is the momentum of a photon of helicity @xmath46 in the @xmath47 rest frame : @xmath48 both amplitudes are related to the corresponding matrix element of the isovector current : @xmath49 for the electric quadrupole amplitude @xmath43 , according to the siegert s theorem  ( see for instance  @xcite ) , one can use the zero component @xmath50 as well the space component  @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we decide to express the amplitude @xmath43 via the @xmath2 transition matrix element of @xmath52 ( charge density ) of the current @xmath53 : @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in the present model this quantity can be calculated  @xcite directly in terms of quark matrix elements whereas the for @xmath51 one should use supplementary the classical equations of motion ( saddle point ) , for which the ansatz ( [ rothedg ] ) is apparently not a solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath44 is directly related to the @xmath2 transition matrix element of the space components @xmath55 : @xmath56 in the case of @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .    for the matrix element of the isovector current @xmath62 </S>",

    "<S> we will only sketch the derivation . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the expectation value of the quark bilinear operators , @xmath63 , represented by the euclidean functional integral  @xcite with lagrangean ( [ lagrangean ] ) : @xmath64 integrating out the quarks in ( [ form - factor - integral ] ) it is easy to see that the result is naturally split in valence and sea parts . </S>",
    "<S> after that we follow the same steps as for correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) . first , we integrate over the meson fields in saddle point approximation ( large @xmath18 limit ) . as a second step , </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the rotational zero modes using the ansatz ( [ rothedg ] ) . due to the collective path integral over @xmath29 </S>",
