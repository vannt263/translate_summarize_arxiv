    "cooper  schrieffer theory of superconductivity . for detailed physical description and mathematical modeling of the superconductivity phenomena",
    ", we refer to the review articles @xcite . theoretical analysis for the tdgl equations can be found in literature @xcite .",
    "the global existence and uniqueness of the strong solution were established in @xcite for the tdgl equations with the lorentz gauge .",
    "numerical methods for solving the tdgl equations have also been studied extensively , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "a semi - implicit euler scheme with a finite element approximation was first proposed by chen and hoffmann @xcite for the tdgl equations with the lorentz gauge .",
    "a suboptimal @xmath21 error estimate was obtained for the equations in two dimensional space .",
    "later , a decoupled alternating crank  nicolson galerkin method was proposed by mu and huang @xcite .",
    "an optimal error estimate was presented under the time step restrictive conditions @xmath22 for the two - dimensional model and @xmath23 for the three - dimensional model , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mesh size in the spatial direction and the time direction , respectively .",
    "all these schemes in @xcite are nonlinear . at each time step",
    ", one has to solve a nonlinear system . clearly , more commonly - used discretizations for nonlinear parabolic equations are linearized schemes , which only require the solution of a linear system at each time step . a linearized crank ",
    "nicolson type scheme was proposed in @xcite for slightly different tdgl equations and a systematic numerical investigation was made there .",
    "an optimal error estimate of a linearized crank  nicolson galerkin fe scheme for the tdgl equations was provided unconditionally in a recent work @xcite .",
    "all these methods mentioned above were introduced to solve the tdgl equations - for the order parameter @xmath4 and the magnetic potential @xmath5 by galerkin fems ( or finite difference methods ) and then , to calculate the magnetic field @xmath26 by certain numerical differentiation .",
    "there are several drawbacks for such approaches .",
    "one of important issues in the study of the vortex motion in superconductors is the influence of geometric defects , which is of high interest in physics and can be considered as a problem in polygons .",
    "previous numerical results @xcite by conventional lagrange fems showed the singularity and inaccuracy of the numerical solution around corners of polygons . moreover , for the problem in a nonconvex polygon , conventional lagrange fems for the tdgl equations may converge to a spurious solution , see the numerical experiments reported in @xcite for the problem on an @xmath27-shape domain .",
    "another issue in the superconductivity model is its coupled boundary conditions in , which may bring some extra difficulties in implementation to conventional lagrange fems on a general domain , see section 5 of @xcite for more detailed description .",
    "it is natural that a mixed finite element method with the physical quantity @xmath0 being the new variable may offer many advantages .",
    "it has been noted that mixed methods for second order elliptic problems , such as the scalar poisson equation @xmath28 with simple boundary conditions , dirichlet or neumann , have been well studied with the extra variable @xmath29 in the last several decades , e.g. , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , mixed finite element methods for the vector poisson equation @xmath30 with the coupled boundary conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 seems much more complicated than for a scalar equation . theoretical analysis was established quite recently @xcite in terms of finite element exterior calculus . for the tdgl equations - in two dimensional space , chen @xcite proposed a semi - implicit and weakly nonlinear scheme with a mixed finite element method , in which both @xmath33 and @xmath34 were introduced to be",
    "extra unknowns , and the corresponding finite element spaces for @xmath33 and @xmath34 were constructed with certain bubble functions and some special treatments in elements adjacent to the boundary of the domain were also needed . a suboptimal @xmath21 error estimate was provided and no numerical example was given in @xcite .",
    "recently , a linearized backward euler galerkin - mixed finite element method was proposed in @xcite for the tdgl equations in both two and three dimensional spaces with only one extra physical quantity @xmath0 ( @xmath35 in two dimensional space ) .",
    "no analysis was provided in @xcite . the scheme is decoupled and at each time step ,",
    "one only needs to solve two linear systems for @xmath4 and @xmath36 , which can be done simultaneously .",
    "this paper focuses on theoretical analysis on a linearized galerkin - mixed fem for the tdgl equations to establish optimal error estimates .",
    "more important is that our analysis is given without any time - step restrictions and under more general assumptions for the regularity of the solution of the tdgl equations , which includes the problem in nonconvex polygons and certain convex polyhedrons .",
    "usually , conventional fems for a scalar parabolic equation require the regularity of the solution in @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xcite , while for the tdgl equations in a nonconvex polygon , @xmath39 and @xmath33 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 in general @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show clearly that the mixed method converges to a true solution for problems in a nonconvex polygon and conventional lagrange type fems do not in this case .",
    "in addition , in the mixed fem , the coupled boundary condition @xmath42 reduces to a dirichlet type boundary condition @xmath43 .",
    "implementation of dirichlet boundary conditions for vector - valued elements ( such as ndlec and raviart  thomas elements ) becomes much simpler . in a recent work by li and zhang , an approach based on hodge decomposition",
    "was proposed and analyzed with optimal error estimates .",
    "however , the approach is applicable only for the problem in two - dimensional space due to the restriction of the hodge decomposition .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ femmethod ] , we introduce the linearized backward euler scheme with galerkin - mixed finite element approximations for the tdgl equations and we present our main results on unconditionally optimal error estimates . in section [ preparation ] , we recall some results for an auxiliary elliptic problem of the vector poisson equation with the coupled boundary conditions . in section [ proofmainresult ] , we prove that an optimal @xmath21 error estimate holds almost unconditionally ( @xmath44 , without any mesh ratio restriction ) . in section [ numericalresults ] ,",
