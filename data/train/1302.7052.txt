    "error fields ( efs ) @xcite are known to lower confinement in toroidal plasmas and , in general , to lower their rotation .",
    "an exception is the neoclassical toroidal viscosity induced `` offset rotation '' @xcite . additionally , efs can seed magnetic islands by ef penetration or cause locking of pre - existing islands @xcite , often resulting in disruptions @xcite .",
    "correction techniques were developed to minimize efs and their effects @xcite .",
    "the most widespread technique consists in reducing the density until a locked mode forms , with the achievement of lower densities indicating better ef correction : performing the ramp in presence of different , deliberately applied static magnetic perturbations ( mps ) , allows to indirectly infer the ef and its best correction .",
    "this , however , is the best correction at low density and thus at low beta , but experimental evidence @xcite and recent iter modeling @xcite suggest that the best correction at high beta can be significantly different due to plasma response @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the technique described above needs several discharges , each terminating with a locked mode and , often , a disruption .    here",
    "we present an ef correction ( efc ) technique not based on the appearance of low - density locked modes , not restricted to low beta , non destructive , and requiring only a fraction of a discharge .",
    "in fact , it could be deployed multiple times within the same discharge , to dynamically assess and correct the ef in real time as it evolves .",
    "the technique was inspired by diii - d experiments in which rotating mps were used to rotate and reposition locked tearing modes of poloidal / toroidal mode number @xmath1=2/1 and bring them in view of gyrotron launchers , for their stabilization @xcite . in spite of the mps rotating uniformly , the experiments showed non - uniformities in the mode rotation .",
    "these observations were explained with the fact that rotation was taking place in the presence of efs , and the mode was in fact locked to the resultant of the static ef and the applied rotating mp .",
    "such resultant does not rotate uniformly , neither is it constant in amplitude .",
    "in fact , if the mp is weaker than the ef , the resultant does nt even describe complete revolutions and , for short periods of time , it can even rotate opposite to the mp @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the present work is that ( 1 ) the applied mp is known , ( 2 ) the ef+mp resultant can be measured from the dynamics of a mode ( not necessarily a tearing mode ) locked to it and therefore ( 3 ) the ef can be deduced from the difference .",
    "specifically , we applied uniformly rotating mps and analyzed the non - uniform mode rotation and the variations of mode amplitude to precisely infer the amplitude and approximately estimate the toroidal phase of the ef . a subsequent scan permitted to optimize the toroidal phase .",
    "the experiments were carried out at the extrap - t2r reversed field pinch @xcite and were made possible by the coil control system briefly described in sec .  2 .",
    "for simplicity , and unlike the earlier diii - d experiments with @xmath2=2 , @xmath0=1 locked tearing modes , the modes used here were external kink modes of @xmath2=1 and high toroidal numbers , @xmath0=8 and 10 .",
    "the rationale for this decision , explained in sec .  3 ,",
    "is that at extrap - t2r these modes are stable , which made the experiment easier .",
    "sec .  4 contains numerical predictions of the time evolution of the amplitude and toroidal phase of a stable kink mode rotating in the presence of a resistive wall , static efs and a rotating mp .",
    "the predicitions are based on a time - dependent cylindrical mhd model for thin - wall boundary conditions @xcite and are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental results presented in sec .",
    "the transition from incomplete to complete mode rotation allowed to quantify the strength of the @xmath0=8 and 10 efs .",
    "corrections of equal strength and varying toroidal phase were applied by means of static mps until the toroidal phase was optimized . in this optimization",
    "we used two indicators of good efc : the extended discharge duration and a more uniform mode rotation in response to a uniformly rotating perturbation .",
    "extrap - t2r @xcite is a reversed field pinch ( rfp ) of major radius @xmath3=1.24 m and plasma minor radius @xmath4=0.183 m .",
    "external to the vessel is a double - layer copper shell of thickness @xmath5=2@xmath60.5 mm . a magnetic field of poloidal mode number @xmath2 and toroidal mode number @xmath0 penetrates across this resistive shell ( or wall ) in a time @xmath7 which is a fraction of the `` long '' resistive wall time @xmath8 .",
    "theoretically , in the cylindrical limit , this evaluates @xmath9=13.6ms , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the conductivity and radius of the wall .",
    "experimentally , @xmath8 was measured to evaluate approximately @xmath8=11.2ms , slightly larger than earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "earlier works @xcite provided evidence of efs at various @xmath0 .",
    "efs at @xmath0=+8 and @xmath0=+10 , which the present paper focuses on , might be due to the vacuum vessel being made of bellows sections joined with short flat sections ( 15 in total , placed at irregular toroidal angles ) .",
    "extrap - t2r is equipped with a system for the active control of resistive wall modes ( rwms ) and efs .",
    "external to the vessel , and just inside the shell , is an array of 4 ( poloidal ) @xmath6 32 ( toroidal ) saddle loops used to sense the radial field , depicted in fig.[fig_extrap ] .",
    "located outside the shell is an array of 4@xmath632 control coils or actuators , powered by suitably modified audio amplifiers , used to apply radial field perturbations .",
    "various control algorithms were developed and tested with success @xcite , but of particular relevance here is a feedback algorithm presented in @xcite , capable of simultaneously sustaining preset finite amplitudes for all modes of @xmath2=1 and @xmath12 .",
    "these amplitudes are typically set to 0 , to suppress rwms and efs .",
    "the algorithm was modified for the sake of the experiments presented here : the capability was added to suppress all modes except 1 - 4 modes of up to 4 different @xmath0 .",
    "those unsuppressed modes were not controlled in feedback . for the corresponding values of @xmath0 , it was possible to apply static mps of given amplitude and toroidal phase and/or rotating mps of given amplitude , frequency and phase .",
    "in particular , rotating mps were used to excite stable external kink modes and drive their rotation . on occasions ,",
    "static mp were used to deliberately apply `` proxy '' efs , stronger than the intrinsic machine efs , thus easier to detect and optimal to test the method validity .",
    "the rfp equilibrium used for this experiment is defined by the reversal parameter @xcite @xmath13 and the pinch parameter @xmath14=1.66 , where @xmath15 is the poloidal field and @xmath16 is the toroidal field @xmath17 averaged over the plasma cross - section .",
    "[ fig_gamma]a summarizes the stability ( growth rate @xmath180 ) and instability ( @xmath190 ) of @xmath2=1 modes of various toroidal numbers @xmath0 .",
    "the diagram was computed for the equilibrium used .",
    "however , small changes of equilibrium can have significant effects , thus the value of the diagram is mostly illustrative .",
    "modes of @xmath201 are typically stable for the rfp equilibrium used ( low @xmath21 ) and will not be considered here .",
    "the convention on the sign of @xmath0 is as follows : modes with a handedness corresponding to the pitch of field lines inside the reversal surface have @xmath22 0 and modes outside the reversal surface have @xmath230 .",
    "the reversal surface is defined as the surface where @xmath17 changes sign , located at approximately @xmath24=0.82 .",
    "stable modes can only exist in presence of finite perturbations of the same @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "they form ( disappear ) on a timescale @xmath25 as soon as those perturbations are applied ( removed ) .",
    "note that `` modes '' here can refer to tearing or kink modes , depending whether the corresponding rational surface ( resonance ) is internal to the plasma and an island can form , or not . if external to the plasma , the perturbation can only kink the plasma itself .",
    "very high positive @xmath0 , though , can resonate at a surface external to the reversal surface , but inside the plasma .    from left to right in fig.[fig_gamma",
    "] we have :    1 .   rapidly rotating ( tens of khz ) tearing modes ( tms ) of @xmath2612 .",
    "these modes are internal , resonant ( @xmath27 in the plasma ) and stable @xcite .",
    "2 .   unstable and marginally unstable kink modes ( @xmath28 , except @xmath29 , which calculations suggest being marginally stable ) growing on a time scale of the order of @xmath8 or slower . these are basically rwms @xcite .",
    "stable kink modes ( @xmath30 ) only exisiting in presence of an mp of the same @xmath0 .",
    "these mode grow ( decay ) on timescales of order @xmath8 or slower as soon as the mp is turned on ( off ) .",
    "however , they do not grow indefinitely in time : they only grow up to a saturated value proportional to the mp strength .",
    "the proportionality factor , or gain , is dictated by the plasma response .",
    "these modes can also be referred to as stable rwms @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the following considerations can be made with regard to suitability to ef assessment by driven rotation :    1 .",
    "shielding by the shell makes it impossible to couple rotating mps to fast - rotating modes like the tms mentioned above . besides , previous work showed that , at extrap - t2r , the main effect of static mps and efs on tms is their magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "mps rotating at few tens of hz are expected to have the same effect .",
    "unstable and marginally unstable rwms can in principle be used , but their growth would be in competition with other effects on their amplitude , making it difficult to extract the effect of the ef .",
    "these modes will be the subject of future work .",
    "3 .   rwms of @xmath31 , however , are stable .",
    "this simplifies the extraction of ef and mp effects on the rwm amplitude , compared with unstable rwms of lower @xmath0 mentioned above .",
    "also , being stable , they decay as soon as their mp+ef drive is zeroed , which is also an indication of good efc . more generally , as soon as the drive is reduced or steered ,",
    "so is the rwm .",
    "finally , stable rwms amplify efs , making it easier to measure them with sensor coils .",
    "it should also be mentioned that a suitable mode for the technique proposed does _ not _ need to be preexistent : it can be generated when necessary , for instance by a @xmath32 ramp at low rotation , like ntms in the diii - d experiments cited above @xcite . it does not need to be rotating either .",
    "for example , it can be a non - rotating locked tearing mode not preceded by a rotating precursor , but rather seeded by ef or mp penetration .",
    "on the other hand , it does not need to be exactly locked either : a slowly rotating quasi - stationay mode will still be affected by efs in its rotation .    rather , the mode of choice needs to interact with the ef .",
    "the ef and , as a result , the mode , needs to depend on the toroidal angle @xmath33 , and it must be possible to define a @xmath33-dependent potential energy , reaching a minimum for a certain value of @xmath33 . for this , it is not necessary for the mode and the dominant ef to have the same @xmath2 and @xmath0 : the interaction of modes and efs of different mode numbers will still depend on @xmath33 .",
    "let us expand the radial field @xmath34 measured at the wall in poloidal and toroidal components @xmath35 in the cylindrical ( large aspect ratio ) limit :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath33 are the radial , poloidal and toroidal coordinate respectively",

    "the jump in the radial derivative across the shell on the right hand side of the equation is due to eddy currents induced in the conductive thin shell itself .",
    "these eddy currents can be due to modes in the plasma and/or currents in the control coils .",

    "is due to the applied external perturbation ( eq.[eq_bext ] ) but is modified by the plasma response .",

    "this transient typically lasts few ms ( see plots of @xmath61 in fig.[fig_gamma]a , for various modes ) . after the transient , eq.[eq_bsim ] for stable modes ( @xmath620 )",
    "simplifies as follows :    @xmath63    where    @xmath64    eq.[eq_bsim ] is used to simulate the experimental results with @xmath65ms and @xmath39 and @xmath47 from fig.[fig_gamma ] .",
    "fig.[fig_mod ] shows simulation results for @xmath0=10 , a static field @xmath52=0.4mt and four values of the probing field @xmath53 , rotating at 50hz .",
    "note that in the experiment @xmath53 is known , while @xmath52 is the unknown total static ef , which can be determined as follows .",
    "a small rotating field @xmath66 does not drive a complete rotation of the mode , but only an oscillation around the phase of @xmath52 ( here assumed 0 ) , accompanied by large amplitude variations ( blue curves in fig.[fig_mod ] ) . under the effect of a large rotating field @xmath67 , instead",
    ", the sensors register a complete , uniform rotation and smaller relative changes of amplitude ( green curves ) . finally , when the rotationally shielded probing - field magnitude @xmath68 ( eq.[eq_b1 ] ) is slightly smaller or larger than the ef @xmath52 , the result is a large oscillation in the first case ( red ) , and a complete , although highly non - uniform rotation in the second ( black ) .",
    "correspondingly the angular velocity has negative or positive peaks , respectively ( fig.[fig_mod]c ) .",
    "the transition from one behavior ( oscillations ) to the other ( complete rotations ) occurs for @xmath69 .",
    "experimentally identifying this transition allows to indirectly measure the ef amplitude @xmath52 .",
    "also , @xmath52 has toroidal phase @xmath33=0 in the example of fig.[fig_mod ] , but this can be easily generalized : if its phase is @xmath33 , the measured field will oscillate around @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 can also be measured when @xmath34 reaches its minimum , i.e.  as the mid - point of the large phase oscillation recorded before the mode describes a complete rotation .",
    "however , that is a large oscillation occurring in a short time , hence this measurement of @xmath33 suffers from errors .",
    "in fact , the closer one gets to the transition , the preciser is the measurement of @xmath70 , but the higher is @xmath71 , thus the more rapid the variation of @xmath33 and the less precise its measurement , as if the two quantities @xmath70 and @xmath33 were related by an indetermination principle .",
    "fig.[fig_mod ] displays curves for four values of the rotating field @xmath53 , but the calculations were repeated for several other values .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.[fig_sum ] , as a function of @xmath53 . in particular , fig.[fig_sum]a shows the minimum the minimum sensor measurement @xmath72 that can be reached at some time ( i.e. , for some toroidal orientation of the applied mp ) for a given amplitude @xmath53 of the rotating probing field .",
    "fig.[fig_sum]b presents the modeled phase velocity of the measured perturbation , @xmath73 , reached at that same time .",
    "as already seen in fig.[fig_mod ] , when @xmath72 reaches a minimum , the angular velocity reaches an extreme ( either a negative minimum , if the rotation is incomplete , or a positive maximum , if the rotation is complete ) .",
    "perfect error field cancellation is obtained when the modeled measured @xmath72 is suppressed to zero ( @xmath740.6mt in fig.[fig_sum]a ) . at that time , the angular speed @xmath73 transitions from strongly negative to strongly positive ( fig.[fig_sum](b ) ) .",
    "note that observing a transition for a certain value of @xmath53 in figs.[fig_mod]-[fig_sum ] does not imply that the ef @xmath52 takes that same value .",
    "this would only be true in the limit of very slow rotation , @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise , the amplitude @xmath53 of the rotating perturbation ( as applied outside the shell ) undergoes some screening , and a stronger @xmath53 needs to be applied to cancel a given @xmath52 . from eq.[eq_b1 ] , we can estimate the screening factor to evaluate @xmath76 for @xmath77=50hz .",
    "thus , observing a transition at @xmath780.6mt in figs.[fig_mod]-[fig_sum ] agrees with the fact that the ef assumed above for this example evaluates @xmath52=0.4mt .",
    "here we present the proof of principle of the proposed ef assessment technique based on driven rotation of modes . for the reasons discussed in sec.3 ,",
    "it was decided to use stable external kinks and characterize efs of the same mode numbers : @xmath2=1 , @xmath0=8 and @xmath79 , @xmath0=10 .",
    "we started with @xmath0=10 kinks ( more stable ) and progressed to @xmath0=8 , which was found to be the lowest stable @xmath0 and to have a smaller , thus , more difficult detect , intrinsic ef associated with it .",
    "for the first test , static mps were used to apply `` proxy '' efs of @xmath0=10 , i.e.  fictitious efs , stronger than usual and thus easier to detect .",
    "the @xmath0=10 ef was suppressed by automatic feedback as usual @xcite in the first 10ms of the discharges illustrated in fig.[fig_n10lproxyraw ] . at @xmath8010ms ,",
    "though , the intrinsic @xmath0=10 ef was left uncontrolled and an mp was applied , to simulate an @xmath0=10 ef of 0.92mt . in order for such ef to be constant ,",
    "the actual programmed mp applied was increasing slightly on a timescale comparable with the discharge duration .",
    "this timescale is unrelated to @xmath81 , @xmath60 , @xmath8 or @xmath47 , but rather due to subtleties in the control hardware @xcite .    in the same time - interval ( @xmath8010ms )",
    "an @xmath0=10 rotating mp was also applied .",
    "its rotation frequency , 50hz , enables the observation of at least two rotation periods within a typical extrap - t2r discharge .",
    "the resultant of the static mp , rotating mps , and of the much smaller uncorrected ef , excites a rwm of @xmath0=10 and thus of negative growth rate ( fig.[fig_gamma]a ) , that is , stable .",
    "the time - evolution of its amplitude , toroidal phase and angular velocity is regulated by eq.[eq_bsim ] or , after a transient of few ms , by its approximation , eq.[eq_bsimplif ] .",
    "indeed we obtained sensor coil measurements ( figs.[fig_n10lproxyraw]-[fig_n10lproxyan ] ) very similar to the calculations in figs.[fig_mod]-[fig_sum ] , including the hyperbolic behavior of @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the transition from incomplete to complete mode rotation occurs between @xmath53=0.35mt and @xmath53=0.55mt ( fig.[fig_n10lproxyraw]b ) , at @xmath82mt ( fig.[fig_n10lproxyan]b ) . for consistency and comparison with eq.[eq_bsim ] , we retained in the sensor measurements the direct contribution of the applied mps ( both static and rotating ) .",
    "in other types of analysis , e.g.  to extract the field @xmath34 associated with a mode , the contribution of the mps could have been removed by `` vacuum subtraction '' , i.e.  by taking separate measurements in presence of mps but in absence of plasma , and subtracting them from the actual plasma measurements .",
    "this was not the case here , because @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined above include the applied static and rotating mps .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of the vertical ( vf ) and toroidal field ( tf ) coils on the sensor measurements was vacuum - subtracted .",
    "the reason is that those coils introduce a high background in the @xmath34 measurements , but such background is nearly perfectly axisymmetric , i.e.  the vf and tf are not significant sources of @xmath0=10 ef .    with the screening factor",
    "@xmath83 taken into account , it is `` estimated '' that the proxy ef ( which is actually known , but is treated as an unknown for this test ) amounts to @xmath84mt .",
    "the error results from the propagation of the uncertainties in the measured screening factor ( circa @xmath85 ) and in the rotating mp amplitude ( while the programmed amplitude was constant , the actual amplitude was observed to fluctuate by approximately @xmath86 ) .",
    "the @xmath84mt measurement agrees with the applied field evaluating @xmath52=0.92mt although , rigorously , it needs to be compared with the ef+mp resultant , which is done below .",
    "the toroidal phase can be estimated from fig.[fig_n10lproxyraw]a to be @xmath87 , as this is the value around which signals oscillate .",
    "again , this is in agreeement with the applied proxy having @xmath33=0 .",
    "alternatively , the ef phase could be inferred from the measurement of @xmath33 at the time when @xmath34 reaches its minimum i.e.  when the ef ( the proxy ef ) is best corrected by the efc ( the rotating mp ) .",
    "however , care should be exerted because @xmath33 varies rapidly in the vicinity of that optimal value ( except of course if the rotating mp is strong enough to dominate the kink dynamics and make it rotate uniformly ) .",
    "the screening factor is @xmath83 , and in sec.[sec_numpredict ] it was calculated to evaluate approximately 0.7 , on the basis of the prescribed @xmath55 , calculated @xmath61 ( fig.[fig_gamma]a ) and calculated @xmath88 ( fig.[fig_gamma]b ) . in the experiment , however , rather than calculating it , we estimated the screening factor experimentally by comparing sensor measurements in two plasma discharges with , respectively , large static and large rotating mps .",
    "the mps were large in order for the intrinsic ef to be negligible .",
    "comparing the two discharges showed that , for @xmath2=1 and @xmath0=10 , rotating mps of @xmath77=50hz generate , in presence of plasma , weaker signals ( by a factor 0.54@xmath890.05 ) than static mps of the same intensity .    for a precise determination of @xmath33 , as well as to confirm the good quality of the efc ,",
    "corrections were applied , of amplitude 0.89mt and various @xmath33 , in two sets of discharges , and two indicators of good efc were monitored .",
    "the first indicator is the duration of the discharge : it is well - known that an improved efc leads to better confinement and thus longer discharges , as indeed shown in fig.[fig_n10_phiscan]a .",
    "the broad maximum at @xmath90 agrees with the expected best efc having @xmath91 .    in another set of discharges ,",
    "the efc phase @xmath33 was scanned from one discharge to the other , a small , uniformly rotating mp was applied , and the uniformity of the measured mode rotation was studied : for perfect efc , the mode was expected to rotate uniformly as well .",
    "fig.[fig_n10_phiscan]b confirms that the smaller variation of angular velocity during a rotation period is obtained for @xmath92 , in agreement with expectations .",
    "to further illustrate the good efc , fig.[fig_cartoon_n10_mode ] shows a reconstruction of the plasma edge and radial field based on actual sensor data .",
    "two features can be clearly recognized : the strong @xmath2=1 , @xmath0=10 perturbation at a time when the rotating mp has the same @xmath33 as the proxy ef , and its minimization half a rotation - period later ( when the mp and proxy ef nearly cancel each other ) .",
    "after additional tests with a smaller proxy ef ( 0.23mt , not shown for brevity ) , proxy efs were eventually removed and the the technique was applied to the assessment of the intrinsic @xmath2=1 , @xmath0=10 ef .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig_n10intrinsraw ] and analyzed in fig.[fig_n10intrinsan ] .",
    "the best correction is obtained for a rotating perturbation @xmath53=0.11mt , corresponding to a static ( unshielded ) @xmath93mt , in agreement with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig_n10intrinsraw]b indicates that its toroidal phase is approximately @xmath33=0 .",
    "in retrospect the total static field error ef+mp in the proxy experiment presented above amounted to @xmath94mt and had phase @xmath87 , agreeing within two standard deviations with the measurements , @xmath95mt and @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath0=10 results presented above are easily extended to @xmath9610 at extrap - t2r , as the corresponding rwms are even more stable .",
    "for this reason , it is more interesting to extend the technique to lower @xmath0 .",
    "the extension to unstable @xmath0 will be the subject of a future work . in the present section , we concentrate on marginally stable modes .",
    "it was experimentally determined that the lowest positive stable @xmath0 is @xmath0=8 ( fig.[fig_n78910 ] ) , in rough agreement with the prediction in fig.[fig_gamma]a , that modes of @xmath97 are stable .",
    "similar to the @xmath0=10 experiments , a probing @xmath0=8 mp rotating at 50hz was applied , and its amplitude was varied from one discharge to the other . in a first set of discharges ( figs.[fig_n8lproxyraw]-[fig_n8lproxyan ] ) , an @xmath0=8 ,",
    "@xmath33=0 proxy ef of 0.41 mt was applied .",
    "the screening factor was @xmath98 and the transition to complete rotations occurred at @xmath53=0.44mt .",
    "this implies a @xmath99mt estimate which should not be compared with the static mp , but with the ef+mp resultant ( see below ) .",
    "the toroidal phase is @xmath100 .",
    "ultimately the technique was applied in the absence of proxy efs , to assess the intrinsic @xmath2=1 , @xmath0=8 ef ( figs.[fig_n8intrinsraw]-[fig_n8intrinsan ] ) .",
    "it was established that it has a toroidal phase @xmath101 and an amplitude of 0.15@xmath890.02 mt , in agreement with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "a @xmath33 scan of the discharge duration confirms that the best efc is obtained for a phase @xmath102 ( fig.[fig_n8_phiscan ] ) , which is opposite to the ef phase @xmath103 , as expected .    with this information taken into account",

    "in summary a new non - disruptive error field ( ef ) assessment technique not restricted to low density and thus low beta was demonstrated at the extrap - t2r reversed field pinch .",
    "stable resistive wall modes ( rwms ) of toroidal mode number @xmath0=8 and 10 were generated and their rotation sustained by rotating magnetic perturbations .",
    "due to finite efs , and in spite of the applied perturbations rotating uniformly and having constant amplitude , the rwms were observed to rotate non - uniformly and be modulated in amplitude ( figs.[fig_n10lproxyraw ] , [ fig_n10lproxyan ] , [ fig_n10intrinsraw ] , [ fig_n10intrinsan ] , [ fig_n8lproxyraw ] , [ fig_n8lproxyan ] , [ fig_n8intrinsraw ] , [ fig_n8intrinsan ] , ) .",
    "this behavior was interpreted with a simple theoretical model ( eq.[eq_bsim ] ) and used to characterize and correct intrinsic @xmath0=8 and 10 efs , leading to longer discharges and more uniform mode rotation ( figs.[fig_n10_phiscan ] , [ fig_n8_phiscan ] ) .",
    "the probing perturbation was rotated ( i.e. , its phase was scanned ) during the discharge , while its amplitude was scanned from shot to shot .",
    "it is conceivable that in another device with sufficiently long discharges , such as iter , both parameters ( amplitude and phase ) can be scanned within a single discharge or even a fraction of it , e.g.  by deploying a rotating , growing ( `` spiraling '' ) probing field . while fast relative to the discharge duration ( to guarantee several rotation periods and a thorough scan ) , for ease of interpretation the mp rotation and growth should be slow compared with the rwm growth , the resistive wall time and current diffusion time .",
    "the technique works best with non - growing modes driven by or sensitive to efs ( or , more precisely , to the ef+mp resultant ) .",
    "the principle is that when the drive is reduced or rotated , the mode shrinks or rotates accordingly . at extrap - t2r",
    "we used stable resistive wall modes ( rwms ) of @xmath0=8 and 10 for the reason that these modes , indeed , do not grow .",
    "there was no fundamental reason behind the high @xmath0 .",
    "the technique is easily extended to classical or neoclassical tearing modes in other devices , e.g.  @xmath0=1 locked modes at diii - d , due to ef penetration or not , provided they naturally saturate , as it is often the case for periods of several hundreds of ms , or are kept small by stabilizing electron cyclotron ( ec ) heating . ec current drive is even more stabilizing but its effect depends on its toroidal phase relative to the island o - point and , in fact , can become destabilizing if deposited in the x - point .",
    "this can be used to the advantage of the technique presented , as it enhances the variations of the measured field , but attention has to be paid to separate the effects of the ef and of the current drive .",
    "the extension to unstable modes such as @xmath29 rwms at extrap - t2r is left as future work .",
