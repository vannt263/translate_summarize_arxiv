    "classical t  tauri stars ( cttss ) are young , low - mass stars and often show signs of a strong magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field plays a crucial role in disc accretion by disrupting the inner regions of the disc and channeling the disk matter onto the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "zeeman measurements of the surface magnetic fields of cttss show that the field is strongly non - dipole in many stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field of the ctts v2129 oph has been recently measured with the espadons and narval spectropolarimeters ( d07 ) .",
    "decomposition of the observed field into multipolar components has shown that the field of v2129 is predominantly octupolar ( @xmath6 kg ) , with a smaller dipole component ( @xmath7 kg ) and a much smaller contribution from the higher multipole components .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field geometry has been calculated by extrapolating the surface magnetic field to larger distances by suggesting that the field is potential ( vacuum approximation ) .",
    "the data presented in d07 correspond to the june 2005 observations .",
    "more recent measurements ( july 2009 ) have shown that the field of v2129 oph is larger : @xmath8 kg and @xmath9 kg ( @xcite , hereafter d10 ) .",
    "those authors suggest that the field of v2129 oph varies in time due to the dynamo process . in this paper",
    "we assume that the field is fixed and corresponds to that given by d07 . however , we do perform test experimental runs at larger values of the dipole field .",
    "analysis of the chromospheric spot distribution in v2129 oph have shown that the polar , high - latitude spot dominates ( d07 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "d07 developed an approximate model where they investigated possible paths of matter flow in the potential field along closed field lines ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they concluded that the disk should be disrupted by the dipole component far away from the star , at @xmath10 . in this case matter",
    "flows mainly along the field lines of the dipole component and hits the star at high latitudes which corresponds to observations .",
    "these estimates are useful first - order approximations to the processes in v2129 oph . as a next step it is important to investigate matter accretion onto v2129 oph in global mhd simulations , where the assumption that the field is potential can be dropped , and the interaction of the disk with the complex field of the star can be investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we developed a model star with parameters of v2129 oph and with magnetic field distribution close to that observed in v2129 oph ( as described in d07 ) .",
    "we approximated the field with superposition of the main ( dipole and octupole ) moments , and performed global 3d mhd simulations of matter flow around such a star . in the past",
    ", we were able to model accretion onto stars with quadrupole ( @xcite ) , and octupole @xcite magnetic field components . in this paper",
    "we investigate for the first time accretion onto a star with realistic magnetic field and parameters corresponding to ctts v2129 oph . in the accompanying paper",
    ", we investigate numerically accretion onto a model star with parameters close to bp tau @xcite .",
    "the goals of this paper are the following : ( 1 )   to investigate magnetospheric accretion onto this model star in global 3d mhd simulations , ( 2 )   to investigate numerically the magnetic field structure around the star and to compare it with the initial , potential field , ( 3 )   to compare the simulated and observed accretion spots , ( 4 )  to compare the results with results for a purely dipolar field , ( 5 )  to obtain the accretion rate from simulations and compare it with that obtained from observations , ( 6 ) to investigate the torque on the star .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the numerical model we use in our simulations .",
    "section  3 compares the observed and modeled magnetic fields of v2129 oph .",
    "section  4 discusses the results of the simulations .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  5 .",
    "we solve the 3d mhd equations with a godunov - type code in a reference frame rotating with the star using the  cubed sphere \" grid .",
    "the model has been described earlier in a series of previous papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we describe it only briefly here .    _ initial conditions . _",
    "a rotating magnetic star is surrounded by an accretion disc and a corona .",
    "the disc is cold and dense , while the corona is hot and rarefied , and at the reference point ( the inner edge of the disc in the disc plane ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where the subscripts ` d ' and ` c ' denote the disc and the corona .",
    "the disc and corona are initially in rotational hydrodynamic equilibrium ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an @xmath13-type viscosity is incorporated into the code and helps regulate the accretion rate .",
    "the viscosity is nonzero only in the disc , that is , above a certain threshold density ( which is @xmath14 in the dimensionless units discussed below ) .",
    "we use @xmath15 in this work .",
    "_ boundary conditions .",
    "_ at both the inner and outer boundaries , most of the variables @xmath16 are set to have free boundary conditions , @xmath17 . on the star ( the inner boundary )",
    "the magnetic field is frozen into the surface of the star , that is , the normal component of the field , @xmath18 , is fixed , though all three magnetic field components may vary . at the outer boundary",
    ", matter is not permitted to flow back into the region .",
    "the free boundary condition on the hydrodynamic variables at the stellar surface means that accreting gas can cross the surface of the star without creating a disturbance in the star or the flow .",
    "this neglects the complex physics of the interaction of the accreting gas with the star , which is expected to produce a shock wave in the stellar atmosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    _",
    "a  cubed sphere \" grid _ is used in the simulations .",
    "the grid consists of @xmath19 concentric spheres , where each sphere represents an inflated cube .",
    "each of the six sides of the inflated cube has an @xmath20 curvilinear cartesian grid .",
    "the whole grid consists of @xmath21 cells . in our dipole+octupole model of v2129 oph ,",
    "the octupole component dominates and a high radial grid resolution is needed near the star .",
    "we achieve this by choosing the radial size of the grid cells to be 2.5 times smaller than the angular size in the region @xmath22 , while it is equal to the angular size in the outer region as in all our previous work . the typical grid used in simulations",

    "these reference values include : mass @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass of the star ; distance @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius of the star ; velocity @xmath31 .",
    "the time scale is period of rotation at @xmath32 : @xmath33 .    to derive the reference values for the magnetic field , we take into account that the tilts of the dipole and octupole moments relative to the rotational axis are small , and hence we use the formulae for the axisymmetric case : @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we take one of the above relationships ; for example , the one for the dipole ; to obtain    @xmath43    hence , the reference magnetic field depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 and the dipole magnetic field , @xmath45 .",
    "the reference density @xmath46 and the reference mass accretion rate @xmath47 also depend on these parameters : @xmath48 @xmath49    we find the other reference values in a similar way : the torque @xmath50 ; energy flux , @xmath51 ; energy flux per unit area , @xmath52 ; temperature @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gas constant ; and the effective blackbody temperature @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . tab .",

    "to find the ratio between the dimensionless moments , we use the approximate formulae for aligned moments : and obtain the ratio @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 ) . in a few test cases , we increased the relative strength of the dipole field ( models 4 - 5 ) .",
    ".the reference values which are fixed in all models . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we also calculate the torque on the star from the disk - magnetosphere interaction .",
    "matter coming from the disk in funnel streams can move faster or slower than the star and hence it creates either a positive or negative azimuthal field on the star , and correspondingly a positive ( spin - up ) or negative ( spin - down ) magnetic torque , @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , matter brings some positive angular momentum which spins the star up , @xmath63 .",
    "we calculated both the magnetic , @xmath62 , and matter , @xmath63 , torques , and found that the torque associated with the magnetic field is about 100 times larger than that associated with matter .",
    "this is typical in accretion through the funnel streams ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated the torque for models 1 - 6 and the results are presented in table [ tab : torque ] .",
    "we observed from the simulations that the torque is small and it wanders around zero taking both positive and negative values in models 1 , 5 and 6 ( see tab . [ tab : torque ] ) . in models 2 - 4 , the torque is slightly positive and the star spins up .",
    "we calculated the dimensional torque @xmath64 using corresponding reference values @xmath65 from tab .",
    "[ tab : refval-2 ] .",
    "now , we can estimate the time - scale of spin evolution .",
    "the angular velocity of v2129 oph is ( at its period of @xmath66 days ) @xmath67 , its angular momentum is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 . taking @xmath70 and different values of @xmath62 for different models from tab .",
    "[ tab : torque ] , we obtain the characteristic time - scale as @xmath71 ( see tab . [",
    "tab : torque ] ) .",
    "one can see that the time - scale in all models is longer than the age of v2129 oph which is estimated to be @xmath5 years ( see d07 ) .",
    "hence , the torque observed in simulations is not sufficient to spin down the star to its present slow rotation .",
    "if the star has lost it spin in the past due to disk - magnetosphere interaction , then we should suggest that in the past the accretion rate was higher ( to ensure rapid spin - down ) , and the star s magnetic field was stronger ( to ensure disk truncation at a large distance from the star ) .",
    "in fact it is expected that in the past , v2129 oph has been fully convective and its magnetic field has been amplified due to the dynamo mechanism .",
    "the  propeller \" mechanism can be responsible for the efficient spinning down at this stage ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar winds can also carry angular momentum out at different stages of star s evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the july 2009 observations by d10 did show that the magnetic field of the star is stronger than in 2005 observations , and maybe the field of v2129 oph is higher on an average than in the june 2005 observations .",
    "note , however , that the torque is still somewhat small , even when the dipole field is three times stronger ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : torque ] for model 5 ) .",
    "note that if a torque at the present epoch is small , and a star is not in the rotational equilibrium , then the truncation radius can be at any place ( not at the corotation radius ) .",
    "in such a case one of the main condition which should be satisfied in comparisons of models with observations is the similarity of the spot shapes and positions .",
    "we performed global 3d simulations of disk accretion onto a star with parameters close those of t tauri star v2129 oph .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field of v2129 oph is approximated by slightly tilted dipole and octupole magnetic moments with polar fields of 0.35 kg and 1.2 kg respectively .",
    "test simulations for the case of a pure dipole field , smaller magnetospheres and a larger dipolar field component were performed for comparison .",
    "below , we summarize our findings and compare our results with the d07 observations / model :    * 1 . * the field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate and form magnetic towers above and below the disk .",
    "the potential ( vacuum ) approximation is still valid inside the alfvn ( magnetospheric ) radius , @xmath72 , where the magnetic stress dominates over the matter stress . at larger distances , the magnetic field distribution strongly departs from the potential one ( see fig .",
    "[ blinesv ] ) .",
    "* simulations show that the disk is disrupted by the dipole component of the field and matter flows towards the star in two funnel streams .",
    "the flow in the stream is redirected by the octupole component with part of matter flowing towards the high - latitude pole , and another part into the low - latitude octupolar belt .",
    "the polar spots are located at high latitudes even if the disk is truncated close to the star ( say , at @xmath73 ) .",
    "* 3 . * in the dipole case the spots are latitudinally - elongated , they have a typical crescent shapes and are located at lower co - latitudes @xmath74 ( see also r04 ) . the polar chromospheric spot observed in v2129 oph ( d07 )",
    "is much closer in shape and position to the round , high - latitude polar spot obtained in the dipole+octupole model than the crescent - shaped spot obtained in the pure dipole model .",
    "if the disk is disrupted at @xmath75 , like in our main case ( model 1 ) , then the accretion rate obtained from the simulations is about an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained from observations .",
    "if the disk is disrupted at @xmath76 ( model 3 ) , then the accretion rate has a good match , but the low - latitude octupolar belt spots strongly dominate , which is in contrast with observations . however , if the disk is disrupted at a somewhat larger distance from the star , @xmath77 ( model 2 ) , then the brightest part of the spot is located in the polar region , while the octupolar ring spots are much weaker . in this case",
    "the accretion rate is smaller than the observed accretion rate , but it is within the error bar given by d10 ( see tab . [",
    "tab : mdot ] ) .",
    "hence , model 2 can possibly explain observations of v2129 oph . in that case , future",
    ", more sensitive observations should reveal the arcs of the octupolar belt spots .",
    "both simulations and theoretical estimations point to the fact that a weak dipole field of @xmath78 g can not disrupt the disk at large distances from the star , unless the accretion rate is very low . in a test simulation with a dipole field",
    "twice as strong ( @xmath79 g , model 4 ) , the accretion rate matches the observed accretion rate and the polar spots dominate .",
    "this model explains observations better than the other models .    *",
    "we observed that the main ( polar ) accretion spot is shifted relative to the main ( octupolar ) magnetic pole ( at the phase of 0.15 ) towards the dipole magnetic pole ( see fig .",
    "[ spot - b ] ) .",
    "such a shift may be connected with the fact that matter flows toward the dipole magnetic pole and is only partially redirected towards the octupolar pole .",
    "the dipole and octupole poles differ in phases , and this may lead to the observed phase difference .",
    "on the other hand , the funnel stream can be shifted forward / backward relative to the stellar surface and the phase of the accretion spot may differ from that of the magnetic pole @xcite .",
    "* 7 . * the torque on the star is small and corresponds to a small accretion rate .",
    "the time - scale of spin evolution ( @xmath80 years ) is longer than the estimated age of v2129 oph of @xmath81 years .",
    "hence , disk - magnetosphere interaction can not be responsible for the star s spin evolution at present epoch .",
    "hence , we conclude that the star probably lost most of its angular momentum during the early stages of its evolution , for example , at the stage when a star has been fully convective and had a stronger , dynamo - generated magnetic field .",
    "the  propeller \" mechanism could be responsible for the rapid spin - down @xcite .",
    "in addition , at all stages of evolution angular momentum flows into stellar winds ( e.g. @xcite ) .    among the different simulation runs presented here we prefer those runs where the disk is disrupted at a large distance from the star , within @xmath82 , in which the star is expected to be in the rotational equilibrium state ( zero torque on average ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a state is probable in slowly rotating cttss @xcite .",
    "however , the low values of torque obtained in our simulations raise the question of whether v2129 oph is in the rotational equilibrium state , and hence the position of the inner disk is less important for the analysis .",
    "a new set of observations of v2129 oph done in july 2009 have shown that the octupole and dipole components are about 1.5 and 3 times larger compared with the june 2005 observations discussed in this paper ( d10 ) .",
    "if the field of v2129 oph varies due to the dynamo mechanism , then ( at a steady accretion rate ) the disk will move closer to the star during periods when the field is weaker , and further away when it is stronger . then",
    ", model 2 may explain the june 2005 observations , and models 4 or 5 ( with dipole moments twice and thrice as large ) the july 2009 observations .",
    "if the dipole component is large on an average , say , about ( 0.7 - 1)kg , then the accretion is sufficiently high to explain observations .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of the funnel streams in v2129 oph for a fixed magnetic field geometry .",
    "they chose a much higher accretion rate in their model @xmath83m@xmath84/yr , which is a typical accretion rate for mildly accreting cttss ( see also d07 , @xcite ) .",
    "the density they obtained in the funnel streams was about a hundred times higher compared with our model . at this accretion rate , however , the disk will be truncated very close to the star unless the dipole magnetic field is even higher than discussed above .",
    "there is an interesting possibility that most of the disk matter may accrete directly through the equatorial plane due to magnetic interchange instabilities @xcite , while a smaller amount of matter climbs the magnetosphere and forms accretion spots .",
    "this model can possibly explain the difference between the low accretion rates obtained by d10 from spectral lines , and the much higher accretion rates derived from the disk measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we performed similar 3d mhd simulations of accretion onto another t tauri star , bp tau @xcite where the dipole and octupole components of 1.2 kg and 1.6 kg strongly dominate over other multipoles @xcite . in that case",
    "the dipole component is much stronger than in v2129 oph , and there is a better match between the simulated and observed accretion rates . both v2129 oph and bp tau are examples of stars with complex fields where the dipole component determines the disk - magnetosphere interaction , while octupolar component shapes the spots",
    ".    in some t tauri stars the magnetic field is more complex than in v2129 oph , like in cttss cvcha and crcha @xcite . modeling of such stars requires incorporation of even higher order multipoles , which can be done in future research .",

    "<S> the magnetic field of the classical t tauri star v2129 oph can be modeled approximately by superposing slightly tilted dipole and octupole moments , with polar magnetic field strengths of 0.35  kg and 1.2  kg respectively ( @xcite , hereafter d07 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we construct a numerical model of v2129  oph incorporating this result and simulate accretion onto the star using a three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that the disk is truncated by the dipole component and matter flows towards the star in two funnel streams . </S>",
    "<S> closer to the star , the flow is redirected by the octupolar component , with some of the matter flowing towards the high - latitude poles , and the rest into the octupolar belts . </S>",
    "<S> the shape and position of the spots differ from those in a pure dipole case , where crescent - shaped spots are observed at the intermediate latitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that if the disk is truncated at the distance of @xmath0 which is comparable with the co - rotation radius , @xmath1 , then the high - latitude polar spot dominates , but the accretion rate obtained from the simulations ( and from the accompanying theoretical calculations ) is about an order of magnitude lower than the observed one . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate matches the observed one if the disk is disrupted much closer to the star , at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in that case the octupolar belt spots strongly dominate . in the intermediate case of @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the polar spots are sufficiently bright , and the accretion rate is within the error bar of the observed accretion rate , and this model can explain the observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , an even better match has been obtained in experiments with a dipole field twice as strong compared with one suggested by d07 .    </S>",
    "<S> the torque on the star from the disk - magnetosphere interaction is small , and the time - scale of spin evolution , @xmath4 years is longer than the @xmath5 years age of v2129 oph . </S>",
    "<S> this means that v2129 oph probably lost most of its angular momentum in the early stages of its evolution , possibly , during the stage when it was fully convective , and had a stronger magnetic field .    the external magnetic flux of the star is strongly influenced by the disk : the field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate and form magnetic towers above and below the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the potential ( vacuum ) approximation is still valid inside the alfvn ( magnetospheric ) surface where the magnetic stress dominates over the matter stress .    </S>",
    "<S> accretion , accretion discs - magnetic fields - mhd - stars : magnetic fields . </S>"
