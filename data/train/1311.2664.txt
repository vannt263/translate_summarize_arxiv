    "despite the fact that the standard model of particle physics has various predictions that are in accordance with experimental data , it is generally viewed as an effective realization of an underlying theory to be discovered yet . interestingly to understand the hierarchy problem of the higgs mass , neutrino masses , and the cp asymmetry , one is often allured to resort to the new physics ( np ) beyond sm .",
    "if existing , the np degree of freedom may manifest itself either directly at the hadron collider or indirectly at low energy via its effects to observables that have been precisely constrained . over the past years",
    ", processes induced by flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) have been under sharper scrutiny , as these processes are forbidden at the tree level and thus arise only at the loop level within sm .",
    "many np models have different patterns with sm and enhance the fcnc transition at the tree or loop level , which are likely to affect some physical observables sizably compared to sm .",
    "the rare decay @xmath4 is of this type and proceeds via a fcnc process @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , since all quarks in the final states are different from those in the initial @xmath6 meson , this decay involves only the pure annihilation topology . as a consequence of the power counting rules derived from the heavy quark effective theory , its branching ratio is expected to be very tiny .",
    "meanwhile , on the experimental side , the signature of this decay is very clean .",
    "due to these advantages , the @xmath4 has thus received considerable attentions in both theoretical @xcite and experimental sides @xcite in the past few years .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "an annihilation amplitude involving two light mesons suffers from the endpoint divergence , and many approaches have been advocated for dealing with it . in @xcite , by introducing the effective gluon mass @xmath7 , the authors predicted @xmath8 in sm . while in the r - parity violating supersymmetric model , the branching fraction of this decay could be enhanced to @xmath9 . in the qcd factorization approach",
    ", the endpoint singularity has been usually parameterized by two free parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a phenomenology way , which are mode - dependent and can not be calculated directly . as a result ,",
    "only the upper limit of this decay @xmath12 has been presented in @xcite . by keeping the intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath13 of the valence quarks in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach ,",
    "the annihilation topologies could be calculated directly , as the divergence can be eliminated by the sudakov form factor and the threshold resummation . within the pqcd approach",
    ", its branching ratio has been predicted to be @xmath14 in @xcite , in which the longitudinal polarization fraction was estimated to be about @xmath15 .",
    "however , as discussion the decay modes @xmath16 @xcite , it has been known that the longitudinal polarization fraction about @xmath17 was measured in experiments . in the pqcd framework ,",
    "the annihilation contribution from the @xmath2 operators enhances the amplitudes remarkably due to the helicity flip , so the so - called `` polarization anomaly '' could be well understood .",
    "however , because the @xmath2 operator vanishes in this mode , it is hard for us to understand the large transverse polarization @xmath18 predicted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to re - analyse this decay in sm within the pqcd approach .    as stated above , in sm , the decay @xmath4 is expected to have a small branching ratio , which allows us to search for possible np effects .",
    "hence , another purpose of this work is to explore the effects of an extra @xmath1 boson on this decay , which is allowed in a few well motivated extensions of sm due to an additional @xmath19 gauge symmetry . among many @xmath1 models ,",
    "the most general one is the family non - universal @xmath1 model , which can be realized in various grand unified theories , string - inspired models , dynamical symmetry breaking models , and the little higgs models , just to name a few @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 boson in different representative models has been directly searched at colliders as well as indirectly probed via a variety of precision data @xcite , which put limits on its gauge coupling and/or mass . in such a model ,",
    "the nonuniversal @xmath1 couplings to fermions could lead to fcnc at the tree level , which may enhance the branching ratios of some rare @xmath6 decays dominated by penguin operators . in recent years , the effects of the @xmath1 boson have been studied extensively in the low energy flavor physics phenomenology , such as in @xmath6 physics , top physics , and lepton decays @xcite .    in this work , we will first reanalyze @xmath4 in sm within the pqcd approach in sec.[sec:2 ] , and find that the results for branching ratios are larger than the predictions in @xcite .",
    "we then in sec.[sec:3 ] consider the contribution of the non - universal @xmath1 boson , which could change the branching ratio in the suitable parameters space . at",
    "last , we summarize this work in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in sm , the relevant effective weak hamiltonian related to @xmath4 is given by : @xmath20 @xmath21 are the four - quark operators and @xmath22 are the corresponding wilson coefficients , whose explicit expressions are refereed to @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements . then , the decay width for this decay is written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the momentum of the outgoing mesons and @xmath27 comes from the identical final state particles .",
    "the decay amplitude @xmath28 will be calculated later , where the subscript @xmath29 denotes the helicity states of the two vector mesons with @xmath30 standing for the longitudinal ( transverse ) component .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude @xmath28 can be decomposed into : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the polarization vector and the four - momentum of the final state vector meson , respectively .",
    "conventionally , the longitudinal @xmath34 helicity amplitudes and the transverse helicity amplitudes @xmath35 are defined by @xmath36 with the helicity summation , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "another equivalent set of definitions of helicity amplitudes is also used , @xmath39 with the normalization factor @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 where the notations @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 denote the longitudinal ( @xmath45 ) , parallel ( @xmath46 ) , and perpendicular ( @xmath47 ) polarization fractions , respectively .",
    "decay in the pqcd approach .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now , we will evaluate the hadronic matrix elements @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 using the pqcd approach . according to the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiton ] ) , we draw the lowest order diagrams of @xmath4 as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] . in pqcd , the decay amplitude is factorized into the soft part @xmath51 , the hard part @xmath52 , and the harder one @xmath22 characterized by different scales .",
    "it is conceptually written as , @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 denotes the momentum fraction of a light quark in each meson , and @xmath55 is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath56 means the trace over dirac and color indices , and @xmath57 is the wilson coefficient evaluated at scale @xmath58 .",
    "the universal wave function @xmath59 describes hadronization of a quark and an anti - quark into the meson @xmath60 , whose structure can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 is the six - quark hard scattering kernel , which consists of the effective four quark operators and a hard gluon attaching to the spectator quark in the decay , so it can be perturbatively calculated .",
    "the function @xmath61 describes the threshold resummation which smears the end - point singularities .",
    "the last term @xmath62 , coming from the resummation of the double logarithm @xmath63 , is the sudakov form factor which suppresses soft dynamics effectively .    as shown in fig.[fig:1 ] , there are four kinds of feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath64 decay at leading order .",
    "they involve two types : factorizable diagrams ( @xmath65 ) and ( @xmath66 ) , and non - factorizable diagrams ( @xmath67 ) and ( @xmath68 ) . after calculating these diagrams",
    ", we can get the amplitudes as follows : @xmath69+m_{ann}^{ll , i}\\left[c_{4}-\\frac{1}{2}c_{10}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\&+ & f_{b } f_{ann}^{lr , i}\\left[c_5+\\frac{1}{3}c_{6}-\\frac{1}{2}c_7-\\frac{1}{6}c_{8 } \\right ]    + m_{ann}^{sp , i } \\left[c_6-\\frac{1}{2}c_{8}\\right]\\bigg\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 stands for the longitudinal polarization and the two transverse polarizations .",
    "@xmath71 comes from the contribution of the factorizable diagrams with the operators @xmath72 or @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the decay constant of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "@xmath75 is the non - factorizable amplitude with the operator @xmath72 or @xmath2 , and the latter operator is from the fierz transformation of the operator @xmath73 . in @xcite",
    ", the authors had listed all formulae of @xmath76 and @xmath75 at leading order in detail , thus it is not necessary to duplicate them in the current work .    due to the current conservation , for the longitudinal and parallel polarization parts ,",
    "the contributions from the factorizable diagrams @xmath77 and @xmath78 are canceled exactly by each other , leading to @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , there is only @xmath80 left for the factorizable diagrams , but it is suppressed by @xmath81 . for the non - factorizable diagrams @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the longitudinal parts give the leading and dominant contribution , and other terms are suppressed by @xmath81 . that is to say , the contribution of the longitudinal and parallel polarization is only from the non - factorizable diagrams , but the latter one is suppressed by @xmath84 . although the perpendicular part receives another effect from the diagrams @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but their contribution is negligible .",
    "thus , the transverse parts can be dropped safely in sm .",
    "in the numerical calculation , we must input the @xmath6 and @xmath85 meson distribution amplitudes , which are nonperturbative parameters . for the @xmath6 meson",
    ", we employ the function @xmath86\\label{bw } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the shape parameter @xmath87 gev has been adopted in all previous analysis of exclusive @xmath6 meson decays .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath88 gev is related to the decay constant @xmath89 mev .",
    "since the @xmath85 meson is a vector particle , there are six distribution amplitudes up to twist 3 , and all of them have been calculated in qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the formulae have been also given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "honestly speaking , there are many theoretical uncertainties in our calculation . for the penguin - dominated decays ,",
    "one of the important uncertainties is from the hard scales @xmath58 , which are defined as the invariant masses of internal particles and are required to be higher than the factorization scale @xmath90 , @xmath66 being the transverse extents of the mesons .",
    "another large uncertainty comes from the distribution amplitude of @xmath6 meson , since it can not be calculated directly from the first principle .",
    "varying the hard scales @xmath58 between @xmath91 times the center values and the shape parameter @xmath92 , we then obtain the @xmath64 branching ratio @xmath93 the uncertainties from the @xmath85 meson distribution amplitudes are less than @xmath94 , so we will not discuss them here .",
    "the above branching ratio can be measured at the large hadron collider beauty ( lhcb ) experiments or the super-@xmath6 factory in future , which helps test sm . for the longitudinal polarization fraction",
    ", it is given by @xmath95 compared with the results of @xcite , our branching ratio is about twice larger than theirs . for the polarization , it does not agree with theirs either .",
    "furthermore , the large longitudinal polarization fraction in the annihilation decay mode @xmath96 has been also confirmed in @xcite . with the formulae and parameters given in @xcite",
    ", we get the branching ratio @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which agree with present results considering the difference of wilson coefficients and other parameters .",
    "now we are in position to analyze this process with an extra gauge boson @xmath1 . in the gauge basis , ignoring the mixing between @xmath99 and @xmath1 , we write the @xmath1 term of the neutral - current lagrangian as @xmath100 \\psi^i_j ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the family index and labels the fermions .",

    "the superscript @xmath105 refers to the gauge interaction eigenstate , and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) denotes the left - handed ( right - handed ) chiral coupling . after rotating to the physical basis ,",
    "the fermion yukawa coupling matrices @xmath108 in the weak basis can be diagonalized as @xmath109 using the unitary matrices @xmath110 in @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the mass eigenstate fields .",
    "the ckm matrix is usually given by @xmath114 so , the chiral @xmath1 coupling matrices in the mass basis of down - type quarks could be written as @xmath115 if @xmath116 are not proportional to the identity matrix , @xmath117 will have nonzero off - diagonal elements that induce fcnc interactions . in the current work",
    ", we will assume that the right - handed couplings are flavor - diagonal for simplicity .    with nonzero flavor - diagonal matrix elements",
    ", the @xmath1 boson contributes to fcnc at the tree level , and its contribution will interfere with sm contributions . in particular , the flavor - changing couplings of the @xmath1 boson with the left - handed fermions will contribute to the @xmath118 and @xmath119 operators for the left ( right)-handed couplings at the flavor - conserving vertex , i.e. , @xmath120 receive contributions from the new @xmath1 boson .",
    "then , the @xmath121 part of the effective hamiltonian for @xmath122 transitions has the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the mass of the new gauge boson .",
    "@xmath126 are the effective operators in sm . due to the hermiticity of the effective hamiltonian",
    ", we always assume that the diagonal elements of the effective coupling matrices @xmath127 are real .",
    "however , there is still a new weak phase @xmath85 in the off - diagonal one of @xmath128 . compared with eq.([hamiton ] ) , the resultant @xmath1 contributions to the wilson coefficients are @xmath129 with @xmath130 since the heavy degrees of freedom in the theory have already been integrated out at the scale @xmath103 , the rg evolution of the wilson coefficients after including the new contributions from @xmath1 is exactly the same as in sm @xcite .    generally , we always suppose @xmath131 if both the @xmath132 and @xmath133 gauge groups have the same origin from some grand unified theories .",
    "though the @xmath1 boson has not been detected in large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments , we always expect the mass @xmath134 to be at the tev scale , which would lead to @xmath135 . in order to explain the mass differences of @xmath136 and the @xmath137 asymmetry anomalies in @xmath138 , @xmath139 should be of @xmath140 .",
    "more about constraints on these parameters are refereed to @xcite .",
    "to quantify the effects of the @xmath1 boson , we consider @xmath141 $ ] in the following discussion .",
    "moreover , for the new weak phase @xmath85 , we treat it as a free parameter .",
    "our analyses are divided into the following three scenarios with different simplifications , namely ,    * s1 : ignoring the right - hand couplings , i.e. , @xmath142 . * s2 : supposing that the left - hand couplings share the same values a thse right - hand values , i.e. , @xmath143 .",
    "* s3 : allowing arbitrary values for @xmath144 without any simplifications .    with the possible parameter space",
    ", we evaluate the @xmath64 branching ratios under the different scenarios together with the sm contribution as @xmath145 where the first two errors are from uncertainties of pqcd , i.e. the shape parameter @xmath146 and the hard scale @xmath58 . for the @xmath1 contribution",
    ", we scan all possible parameter space ( @xmath144 and the new weak phase @xmath85 ) , and get the third uncertainties . as for the center values , we take @xmath147 and @xmath148 . under s1 ,",
    "it is clear that the @xmath1 boson plays a destructive role for the branching ratio , while the branching ratio will be enhanced after adding the contribution from the right - hand couplings under s2 and s3 . since only one strong phase exists",
    ", there is no @xmath137 asymmetry in this decay .",
    "the polarizations are almost unchanged , though the new @xmath1 particle could change the transverse parts of the amplitudes .     under s1(left panel ) and s2 ( right panel ) , where the dashed ( red ) , solid ( black ) and dot - dashed ( blue ) lines correspond to @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",

    "the range with horizontal lines shows the prediction in sm after adding the two errors in quadrature.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to study the effect of the @xmath1 boson clearly , we plot the variation of the branching ratio as a function of the new weak phase @xmath85 with different values of @xmath152 under s1 ( left panel ) and s2 ( right panel ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . according to these plots",
    ", we note that if @xmath153 , i.e. a heavy @xmath1 boson , the new physics effect is too small to be detected . even for @xmath154 under both scenarios ,",
    "its effect is also hard to measure in experiments , because it will be buried by the uncertainties of pqcd in sm . while @xmath155 , the @xmath1 boson will change the branching ratio remarkably , but the trends are different for different scenarios . under s1 ,",
    "the branching ratio becomes larger and exceeds the predicted range in sm with a large phase , while it becomes smaller with a small weak phase , which can be seen from the left panel of fig.[fig:2 ] . for s2 ,",
    "as seen from the right panel , it has an opposite situation . as for s3 , by varying @xmath156 and @xmath157 independently , we present the maximal and minimal curves of the branching ratio as functions of @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is found that the range of the branching ratio is much larger than the sm predictions , which is also shown in eq .",
    "( [ results ] ) . when @xmath148 , the maximal value is about @xmath158 , which is about twice of prediction of sm . on the contrary , by setting @xmath159 , it will be decreased to half of the center value of the sm prediction .",
    "all the above results can be tested in the current lhcb experiments or at the super-@xmath6 factory in future . moreover ,",
    "if the @xmath1 boson would be detected in future , the observation of this mode will in turn help us constrain the @xmath1 mass and its couplings to fermions .",
    "in this work , we have re - calculated the branching ratio and the polarization fractions of the pure annihilation decay @xmath160 within the perturbative qcd approach in both sm and the non - universal @xmath1 model .",
    "we found that this mode is longitudinal part dominated and its longitudinal polarization fraction is about 1 because of absence of contributions from the operator @xmath2 .",
    "the branching ratio is estimated to be @xmath161 , which may be measured in the ongoing lhcb experiments or at the super-@xmath6 factory in future .",
    "considering the effect of an additional @xmath1 boson , we found that the branching ratio may be enhanced by a factor of 2 , or reduced to half in the allowed parameter space , as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "thus , if this mode could be measured in the lhcb experiments and/or at the super-@xmath6 factory , it will provide a test of sm and the non - universal @xmath1 model .",
