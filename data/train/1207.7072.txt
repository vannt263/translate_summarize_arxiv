    "the sensitivity of deep2 allows the k07 sample to probe a large range in galaxy stellar mass and color ( figure  [ colormass ] ) .",
    "in addition to broad morphological selection criteria and a large range in stellar mass , in order to study the evolution of disk galaxy kinematics over a significant look - back time , medium resolution spectra of a _ sizable _ sample of galaxies ( @xmath13 ) which span a wide range in redshift are required .",
    "a sizable sample is needed because emission - line galaxies have significant intrinsic scatter in their kinematic properties ( @xcite ; k07 ) .",

    "we show rest - frame color - magnitude diagrams for galaxies in field 1 of deep2 and highlight the k07 sample .",
    "the k07 sample provides good coverage over galaxy mass .",
    "although it is moderately biased toward blue galaxies at a fixed mass , the effect is not severe .    in the following we",
    "detail how galaxies were selected from field 1 of the deep2 survey to be in the k07 sample .",
    "first , although deep2 reaches a redshift of @xmath30 , k07 chose to be conservative and limit their sample to @xmath6 , leaving 8787 galaxies .",
    "this helps to avoid the high - redshift end of the survey where the selection is in the rest - ultraviolet and becomes dependent on color @xcite .",
    "it also ensures that galaxy axis ratios , which are used to correct rotation velocities for inclinations of galaxies to the line - of - sight , are measured from @xmath2 imaging which has not yet shifted into the ultraviolet since these wavelengths may not trace the bulk of the stellar mass of galaxies .",
    "next , galaxies were chosen to have _ hubble space telescope_/acs imaging at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which further reduces the sample to 3523 galaxies .",
    "this is because there are portions of field 1 which are not imaged by @xmath2 .",
    "aside from removing galaxies which did not have @xmath2 imaging , this requirement did not further affect our sample selection because the @xmath2 images are deeper than the spectral survey .",
    "for our most important selection , galaxies with bright enough emission lines to measure kinematics ( @xmath33 erg s@xmath34 @xmath35 ) were chosen , leaving 1692 galaxies .",
    "galaxies were further selected by k07 to have inclinations measured from @xmath2 images between @xmath36 , and spectrographic slits with position angles aligned to within @xmath37 of their major axes .",
    "these cuts leave a sample of 755 galaxies .",
    "inclinations are measured from @xmath38-band @xmath2 images using the sextractor software package @xcite , as described in @xcite , and have an uncertainty of @xmath39 .",
    "the inclination requirement avoids nearly face - on galaxies for which inclination measurements are very uncertain , and minimizes the effects of dust in the determination of stellar mass for highly inclined systems .",
    "however , if the morphology of a galaxy was deemed by eye to be disturbed enough such that its inclination could not be reliably determined , it was included in the sample but not corrected for inclination",
    ". there are only 24 of these galaxies and they are flagged in most of the following analysis . removing them from the sample does not significantly affect the results of this paper .",
    "for the slit position angles , due to the large slit width ( @xmath40 ) compared to the apparent sizes of galaxies in our sample ( @xmath41 ) and the effects of seeing , accurate kinematics can be measured if slit position angles are offset by up to 40  from galaxy major axes ( figure 13 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , if an emission line was affected by a sky line or an instrumental artifact , the corresponding galaxy was removed from the sample , leaving a total of 544 galaxies in the k07 sample .",
    "no constraints on morphology were applied .    to study the evolution of galaxy kinematics for a sample of blue galaxies which is mass - limited at all redshifts , in  5.1 we limit the k07 sample to galaxies with stellar masses over @xmath42 , as demarcated in figures  [ colormass]  [ velsig_mst ] .",
    "since the stellar mass function of blue galaxies does not evolve significantly since @xmath9 @xcite , we do not change this stellar mass range with redshift .",
    "this cut removes 274 galaxies from the k07 sample , leaving 270 . throughout the paper we will refer to this as the  mass - limited sample . \"",
    "it demonstrates that the average stellar mass of the sample is not the same at all redshifts : it is lower at lower redshift .",
    "this is likely because higher mass galaxies are leaving the sample to become early types .",
    "this phenomenon works in the opposite direction to our results , making them lower limits to the intrinsic evolution , as explained in  5.2 .",

    "further details on how these measurements were made are given in @xcite for a similar survey with a lower spectral resolution : @xmath45 compared with @xmath46 for the k07 sample .",

    "in addition , it has been demonstrated using deeper data with the same telescope / instrument which observe a turn - over in the rotation curve for 90% of galaxies that spectra of our depth do not show a bias in @xmath15 ( figure 6 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "benefits of the deeper data ( as used in * ? ? ?",

    "the results of this paper do not change significantly if these 24 galaxies are removed from the sample .      _",
    "the integrated gas velocity dispersion we measure ( @xmath3 ) is unlike the typical pressure - supported velocity dispersion measured for early type galaxies or galaxy bulges .",
    "_ this is the case for two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath3 is measured from emission lines which trace the gas in galaxies , as opposed to absorption lines which trace stars .",
    "gas , unlike the collisionless stars in an early type galaxy , can dissipate energy and therefore can not remain in a high dispersion equilibrium state with crossing orbits . secondly , because the spectral slits used in the deep2 survey are wide compared to the apparent sizes of the galaxies observed ( @xmath56 slit vs. @xmath57 galaxies ) , @xmath3 effectively integrates velocity gradients on scales at and below the seeing limit @xcite . for values of @xmath3 less than @xmath58 km s@xmath34 , which is the upper limit for well - ordered disk galaxies in the local universe ( figure 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath3 measures the relative motions of individual star - forming regions in galaxy disks .",
    "however , for values of @xmath3 greater than @xmath58 km s@xmath34 , @xmath3 integrates over velocity gradients which can correspond to non - ordered gas kinematics such as small - scale velocity gradients , gas motions due to star - formation , or superimposed clumps along the line of sight . _ in this paper , we collectively refer to these velocity gradients as  disordered motions . \" _    to test for interference from @xmath15 in measurements of @xmath3 , in  5 we compare @xmath3 measured for galaxies in our mass - limited sample with galaxies from deep2 in the same stellar mass range which are face - on in @xmath2 images ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) .",
    "we find no significant difference in the trends of @xmath3 with redshift between these two samples , making it unlikely that the rotation velocity of a galaxy interferes with a measurement of its @xmath3 .    to further investigate what @xmath3 and @xmath15 measure , in @xcite we performed mock observations of a suite of simulations of major mergers of disk galaxies .",
    "these simulations provided model galaxies in various stages of disorder , ranging the gamut from well - ordered disks to merger remnants .",

    "it is apparent that on average low mass galaxies have higher @xmath3 and lower @xmath15 than more massive galaxies at any redshift ( we will investigate this further in  6 ) . therefore , our findings that for galaxies in the mass - limited sample the average @xmath3 and @xmath15 are lower and higher , respectively , at lower redshift than at higher redshift are interpreted as lower limits to the intrinsic evolution .",
    "in addition to ratios with @xmath21 , we look at @xmath64 , a ratio of ordered to disordered motions@xmath84 . this is not an ideal quantity since neither @xmath15 nor @xmath3 is constant with redshift .",
    "nevertheless , due to the significant trends of @xmath3 and @xmath15 with redshift , the median @xmath64 also shows strong evolution ( @xmath85 ; figure  [ ratios ] ) : @xmath86 with @xmath87 .    to determine whether the @xmath15 of a galaxy influences the measurement of @xmath3 , in figure  [ faceon ] we examine the evolution of @xmath3 with redshift for galaxies which are face - on in @xmath2 images ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) and in the same stellar mass range as the mass - limited sample",
    "this is a subset of galaxies for which @xmath3 should be completely secure .",
    "we find the same evolution in the median @xmath3 to within uncertainties for face - on galaxies : @xmath89 , demonstrating that @xmath15 does not influence the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that much of the scatter in the relations of @xmath80 and @xmath79 with redshift is attributable to galaxy properties such as stellar mass and size , and find that trends with stellar mass and size are of similar strengths .",
    "we also demonstrate that there is a threshold in stellar mass and size acting at all redshifts which separates galaxies with high @xmath80 and low @xmath79 from those with low @xmath80 and high @xmath79 .",
    "first we consider stellar mass . in figure",
    "[ mass ] , as in figure  [ ratios ] , we show @xmath80 and @xmath79 as a function of redshift for the mass - limited sample .",
    "however , in figure  [ mass ] galaxies are divided into three stellar mass bins : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "similar trends to those found for the entire mass - limited sample are also found separately for the three mass bins .",
    "interestingly , it is also evident that at all redshifts examined higher mass galaxies are the most kinematically settled ( i.e. , higher @xmath79 and lower @xmath80 ) , intermediate mass galaxies the next most settled , and low mass galaxies the least settled .",
    "this is consistent with downsizing trends in which more massive galaxies attain final structure and star - formation rates sooner ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we refer to this phenomenon as  kinematic downsizing . \"",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a threshold at log @xmath93 which separates galaxies with high @xmath80 and low @xmath79 from those with log @xmath80 and high @xmath79 .",
    "this is most evident in the median points in figure  [ mass ] : those for the lower and intermediate mass bins are very similar , while those for the higher mass bin differ significantly from the other mass bins .",
    "next we examine trends with size .",
    "we consider two size measurements : @xmath2 continuum sizes and emission line extents , as described in  3 .",
    "@xmath2 sizes are unaffected by seeing , and emission line extents are affected by seeing and are _ not _ corrected for it .",
    "figure  [ size ] is similar to figure  [ mass ] except galaxies are color - coded according to size instead of stellar mass . for both size measurements ,",
    "three size bins are shown : @xmath94 kpc , 46 kpc , and @xmath95 kpc .",
    "figure  [ size ] shows that on average at all redshifts examined the largest galaxies are the most kinematically well - ordered , the smallest the most disordered , and intermediate - sized galaxies have properties in between the two .",
    "this is the case for both size measurements .",
    "it demonstrates that emission lines , which we use to measure galaxy kinematics , are likely good tracers of the spatial distribution of the galaxy continua observed in @xmath2 images .",
    "it also demonstrates that we are able to measure reliable rotation velocities for even the small galaxies in our sample .",
    "similar to the stellar mass bins , there is also a size threshold .",
    "it is at 4.0 kpc , which corresponds to the threshold in stellar mass ( log @xmath93 ) in the size versus stellar mass relation for the mass - limited sample .",
    "figures  [ mass ] and [ size ] also demonstrate that the evolution in figures  [ indiv ] and [ ratios ] is not due to a special population of high - redshift galaxies with high values of @xmath3 and low values of @xmath15 .",
    "it occurs even if only massive / large galaxies are considered .",
    "to better quantify how blue galaxies evolve in @xmath3 and @xmath15 , we use these parameters to define a kinematically settled disk galaxy and then study the fraction of settled disk galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "we return again to the full k07 galaxy sample . for the definition of a settled disk ,",
    "we first look to the distribution of @xmath64 in figure  [ velsig_mst ] and then to @xmath2 morphologies .",
    "since we regard higher - mass blue galaxies to be on average kinematically settled disks at low redshift , we look to their values of @xmath64 in figure  [ velsig_mst ] .",
    "a typical value for galaxies with log @xmath96 is @xmath41 ( i.e. , log @xmath97 ) .",
    "we now consider @xmath2 morphologies .",
    "k07 and s. kassin et al.(in preparation ) show that for the full k07 sample , @xmath2 morphologies are correlated with @xmath64 such that galaxies with normal disk - like morphologies via eyeball inspection have higher values than galaxies which appear more disturbed .",
    "we find that @xmath98 indeed provides a reasonable division between normal disk - like and disturbed morphologies , as demonstrated by @xmath2 images of 6 galaxies from the k07 sample in figure  [ morphs ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath98 provides a good separation between the  rotating disks \" and  perturbed rotators \" in the images survey at @xmath19 ( * ? ? ? * figure 6 ) .",
    "the median @xmath64 for galaxies in the local ghasp survey @xcite is 6.3 with an rms scatter of 3.3 , indicating that disk galaxies in the local universe are even more kinematically quiet than those which pass our  settled \" criterion .",
    "this quantitative definition of a settled disk galaxy ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) can be used to measure the fraction of blue galaxies which are settled , @xmath100 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath100 with redshift for the full k07 sample divided into in four stellar mass bins is shown in figure  [ settle ] .",
    "all bins show increasing @xmath100 with decreasing redshift ( i.e. , increasing @xmath100 with time ) .",
    "for example , @xmath100 increases over @xmath1 from 40% to 89% for @xmath101 and from 31% to 65% for @xmath102 . for the less massive bins , we probe smaller ranges in redshift . these are lower limits to the intrinsic evolution , as discussed in  5.2 .",
    "furthermore , at all redshifts the higher the stellar mass of the galaxy population , the higher its value of @xmath100 . the same qualitative behavior is found for settled galaxies defined as @xmath103 , except for the lowest mass bin .        ) , @xmath100 , is shown as a function of redshift for four bins in stellar mass .",

    "these qualitative findings do not change if a settled disk galaxy is defined with @xmath103 .",

    "the frequency of mergers may be decreasing with time .",
    "merging , major but more frequently minor , as is expected in a @xmath26cdm universe , will stir galaxies up ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of mass accreted onto galaxies may be decreasing with time .",
    "mass accretion , although smoother than mergers , might still disturb pre - existing disks ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a simple analytic treatment ) .",
    "galaxies likely have larger molecular gas reservoirs at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "higher gas fractions should result in more star - formation , and feedback from star - formation may also stir up the gas in galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "( 4 . ) finally , higher gas fractions can also lead to violent disk instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) which increase random motions , and may also be a step in the direction of more star - formation .    at bottom , the primary causative factors of disk settling are likely two - fold : more merging / accretion and higher gas fractions at early times .",
    "faster star - formation rates are likely byproducts of these two factors , and increasing potential well depths a byproduct of merging / accretion .",
    "since both factors decline with time , a general kinematic settling with time is expected .",

    "our data are augmented with a compilation of measurements of the kinematics of emission - line galaxies from the literature over @xmath124 .",
    "observations of local massive disk galaxies reveal few examples where disordered motions ( as quantified by @xmath3 ) play as an important role as in similar - mass emission - line galaxies at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of galaxy kinematics at @xmath125 show few clear trends with redshift , likely primarily due to sample selection since only the most highly star - forming systems at these redshifts can currently be studied , but also due to instrumental artifacts and observational conditions .",
    "however , it is clear that higher redshift galaxies have a significant amount of disordered motions , whether or not they show evidence of rotation .    in summary , galaxies seem to have a life cycle : early in their lives they are accreting baryons rapidly , undergoing mergers , and possess a large amount of gas .",

    "<S> we present evidence from a sample of 544 galaxies from the deep2 survey for evolution of the internal kinematics of blue galaxies with stellar masses ranging @xmath0 over @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> deep2 provides galaxy spectra and @xmath2 imaging from which we measure emission - line kinematics and galaxy inclinations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our large sample allows us to overcome scatter intrinsic to galaxy properties in order to examine trends in kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at a fixed stellar mass galaxies systematically decrease in disordered motions and increase in rotation velocity and potential well depth with time . </S>",
    "<S> massive galaxies are the most well - ordered at all times examined , with higher rotation velocities and less disordered motions than less massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify disordered motions with an integrated gas velocity dispersion corrected for beam smearing ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is unlike the typical pressure - supported velocity dispersion measured for early type galaxies and galaxy bulges . </S>",
    "<S> because both seeing and the width of our spectral slits comprise a significant fraction of the galaxy sizes , @xmath3 integrates over velocity gradients on large scales which can correspond to non - ordered gas kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> we compile measurements of galaxy kinematics from the literature over @xmath4 and do not find any trends with redshift , likely for the most part because these datasets are biased toward the most highly star - forming systems . in summary , over the last @xmath5 billion years since @xmath6 , blue galaxies evolve from disordered to ordered systems as they settle to become the rotation - dominated disk galaxies observed in the universe today , with the most massive galaxies being the most evolved at any time . </S>"
