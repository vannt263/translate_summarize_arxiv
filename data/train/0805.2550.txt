    "shocks from protostellar outflows heat and compress the surrounding medium thereby triggering different processes ( e.g. , grain disruption , ice gain mantle sublimation , etc . ) that can release molecules trapped in the grains into the gas phase . in this way , outflows contribute to the chemical enrichment of the gaseous environment surrounding young stars .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by multi - molecular line observations reflecting enhanced molecular abundances either in shocks associated with the outflows or in the outflow cavity walls in the protostellar envelopes ( e.g. , garay et al .  1998 ; bachiller et al .",
    "2001 ; arce & sargent 2006 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "2007 ) . in most cases",
    "these molecules have similar velocity and structure as the co lines that trace the outflows , and it is clear that the outflow is responsible for their overabundance .",
    "the limited outflow chemistry studies show shock - triggered overabundance of parent ( or `` first generation '' ) species molecules that are released directly into the gas phase from the icy dust mantles , like h@xmath1co and ch@xmath0oh as well as other simple molecules presumably formed in the warm gas ( e.g. , so , hco@xmath4 ) .",
    "chemical models indicate that larger organic molecules ( made of 7 atoms or more ) can form on grain surfaces ( e.g. , garrod & herbst 2006 ) and should be present in the gas phase along with the other simpler molecules observed near outflow shocks as suggested by chandler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and remijan & hollis ( 2006 ) . yet ,",
    "up to date , conclusive evidence for shock - triggered overabundances in molecular outflows from low - mass stars ( @xmath5 ) exists only for species with six atoms or less .",
    "here we report the first detection of hcooh , ch@xmath0cn , hcooch@xmath0 , c@xmath1h@xmath2oh in the the l1157 molecular outflow .    the l1157 dark cloud ( at a distance of about 440 pc ) harbors an embedded low - mass stellar object , l1157-mm ( iras 20386 + 6751 ) , that powers a young molecular outflow ( umemoto et al .",
    "the powerful l1157 outflow is comprised of several shocks seen as bright knots in near and mid infrared images ( davis & eisloeffel 1995 ; cabrit et al .",
    "1998 ; looney et al .",
    "millimeter observations of many molecular emission lines show that l1157 is a chemically rich outflow exhibiting an overabundance of sio , ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath1co , cn , hcn , so , and a number of other species by a factor of a few tens to more than @xmath6 , depending on the molecule ( bachiller & prez guitirrez 1997 , hereafter bp97 ) . in the blue ( southern ) lobe ,",
    "the emission from these species is brightest towards two to three clumps ( bachiller et al .",
    "2001 ) , and high - resolution interferometer observations reveal the clumps are associated with shell - like structures created by two jet - driven bow shocks ( zhang et al .  1995 ; gueth et al .",
    "these results indicate that the observed chemical enhancements are induced by the outflow shocks .",
    "observations of the lines shown in table 1 were obtained using the iram 30  m telescope in pico veleta , spain , in june 2007 .",
    "our observations concentrated in the brightest co clump in the blue lobe of the l1157 outflow ( i.e. , the b1 clump ) , located at an offset of @xmath7 , @xmath8 from the l1157-mm protostar at @xmath9(j2000 ) = @xmath10 , @xmath11(j2000 ) = @xmath12 ( bachiller et al .",
    "the b1 clump is far enough from the source and the telescope beam is sufficiently small ( see below ) that any molecular line emission associated with the gas immediately surrounding l1157-mm ( i.e. , within @xmath13 au ) does not contaminate our observations .",
    "two different spectral configurations were used in order to include as many line transitions as possible of hcooh , c@xmath1h@xmath2cn , ch@xmath0cn , and hcooch@xmath0 ( a and e ) complex molecules that have been detected in the immediate surroundings of deeply embedded low - mass protostars ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ; bottinelli et al .",
    "both spectral configurations included four receivers , each simultaneously connected to a 256 channel filter bank with a spectral resolution of 1 mhz and a unit of an autocorrelator , that provided simultaneous observations at four different frequencies ranging from 90.1 to 257.6 ghz .",
    "the autocorrelator was set to provide spectral resolutions of 40 and 320 khz and bandwidths between 40 and 320 mhz .",
    "all observations were obtained in wobbler switching mode with a @xmath14 throw large enough to avoid any possible `` contaminating '' emission from the rest of the blueshifted lobe or the immediate surroundings of l1157-mm .",
    "verification of the telescope pointing approximately every two hours , indicated that the pointing accuracy was between 2 and @xmath15 .",
    "a total integration time of four to ten hours , and average system temperatures between 120 k and 830 k , depending on the frequency , resulted in spectra with rms of 0.002 to 0.01 k. the telescope beamwidth ( fwhm ) at 90.2 , 98.6 , 135.7 , 226.7 , and 257.5 ghz is @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "spectral data presented here are in units of main beam brightness temperature , @xmath21 ( see rohlfs & wilson 2000 ) .",
    "we detect , at a 3 @xmath22 level or higher , five hcooch@xmath0-a transitions , four hcooch@xmath0-e transitions , three ch@xmath0cn transitions , two hcooh transitions and one c@xmath1h@xmath2oh transition ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these were identified using the cdms and jpl catalogs ( mller et al .",
    "2001 ; pickett et al .",
    "we are confident that the emission arises from the l1157 outflow s blue lobe as all lines are blueshifted by 1.5 to 4.0 km  s@xmath23 with respect to the l1157 cloud central velocity ( @xmath24 km  s@xmath23 ) and have a velocity width between 2 and 7  km  s@xmath23 as expected from the velocity distribution of other species associated with the l1157 outflow , observed towards b1 by bp97 .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of our detect lines .",
    "we used the rotational diagram method to estimate the rotational temperature ( @xmath25 ) and column densities of the species for which we detect two or more transitions ( see , e.g. , bisschop et al .",
    "we only detect one transition of c@xmath1h@xmath2oh , so we estimate its column density assuming @xmath26  k ( similar to that of hcooch@xmath0 ) and follow requena - torres et al .",
    "for all lines we assume the emission is optically thin and the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium . in table 2",
    "we show our results with a correction for beam dilution , assuming a source size of 10.5 .",
    "we base our assumption of the source size on the high - resolution interferometer ch@xmath0oh observations of the l1157 blueshfited lobe by benedettini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) which show that b1 is mostly made of two subclumps . taken together",
    ", the emission from these two subclumps extends about 10.5 ( estimated from the geometric mean of the minor and major axis of the emission , see figure 2 of benedettini et al .",
    "2007 ) . whether the complex molecules are formed as a by product of methanol in the warm gas or are ejected from the grain mantle with the methanol ( see below ) ,",
    "we expect the emission from the observed complex molecules to be coincident with that of ch@xmath0oh ( see also , liu et al .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn emission is not corrected for source size as the beam size for all three transitions of this molecule is smaller than 10.5 .",
    "our estimates indicate that most of the detected molecules have @xmath25 between 10 and 30  k. this is lower than the estimated gas temperature of b1 ( @xmath27 k , see below ) , as well as significantly lower than the temperature needed to evaporate off most of the species present in icy grain mantles ( e.g. , van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) .",
    "even so , similar low temperatures have also been derived for the same complex molecules in the gas immediately surrounding low - mass protostars ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ; bottinelli et al . 2004 ; 2007 ) .",
    "it is possible that the low estimates of @xmath25 are due to our poorly constrained rotational diagrams , as we only detect two to four transitions ( mostly at low energies ) for each molecule .",
    "in addition , non - lte effects may influence the derived temperature from the rotational diagram ( goldsmith & langer 1999 ) .",
    "shock - heated molecular gas takes only a few hundred years to cool from 100 k to 20 k ( bergin et al .",
    "1998 ) , and it is plausible that some of the detected molecules come from gas that has cooled down to the estimated low temperatures .",
    "further observations are needed to distinguish with certainty which of the scenarios suggested above affect our estimates .",
    "we calculate the abundance of each molecule ( @xmath28 ) using our estimate of the molecule s column density ( @xmath29 ) and the estimate of h@xmath1 column density ( @xmath30 ) towards b1 obtained by bp97 .",
    "the latter was obtained from single - dish observations of high - velocity co outflow emission and assuming a standard co / h@xmath1 ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "uncertainties on the size of b1 , the co / h@xmath1 ratio and the opacity of the co line introduce uncertainties on our estimate of the absolute value of the abundance . however , these uncertainties are less important when comparing the relative abundance between the different molecules .",
    "our results clearly indicate that complex organic molecules can be found in outflows from low - mass stars .",
    "the interesting question that follows is , how are these complex molecules formed ?",
    "the two main competing scenarios propose that complex organic molecules mainly form either in the warm gas phase or on grain surfaces .",
    "the gas phase models were originally conceived to explain the chemical richness of hot cores . in these objects the radiation from a massive protostar",
    "is believed to heat the dense ( @xmath32  @xmath33 ) inner core to temperatures higher than 100  k where the icy grain mantles evaporate injecting molecules like h@xmath1o , h@xmath1co , ch@xmath0oh into the gas - phase ( e.g. , kurtz et al .",
    "the gas phase models indicate that subsequent chemical ion - molecule reactions in the warm gas can result in the formation of other , more complex , molecules , such as hcooch@xmath0 and c@xmath1h@xmath2oh ( the so called daughter or `` second generation '' species ) ( charnley et al .",
    "1992 ; caselli et al .",
    "1993 ) . alternatively , in the grain surface model",
    ", the observed complex organic molecules are formed on the grain surface and are later released into the gas phase ( with h@xmath1co and ch@xmath0oh ) when the grain mantles evaporate ( e.g. , hasegawa et al .",
    "1992 ; hasegawa & herbst 1993 ) .    in both models ,",
    "a heat source is necessary to evaporate the icy grain mantle . at the position of b1 , the outflow shock is the only source that can trigger the ejection of molecules from the grain surface . using the known characteristics of the l1157 outflow shocks , we can deduce which of the two mechanisms is most likely responsible for the formation of the detected complex molecules .",
    "multi - transition millimeter observations of nh@xmath0 , co and sio indicate that the gas associated with b1 has a temperature between 80 and 300 k and a density of about @xmath34 @xmath33 ( tafalla & bachiller 1995 ; umemoto et al .",
    "1999 ; hirano & taniguchi 2001 ; nisini et al .",
    "the shocked region associated with b1 extends no more than 20 along the outflow axis ( see h@xmath1 image in zhang et al .",
    "2000 ) , and nisini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) indicate that shocks in l1157 have velocities larger than @xmath35  km  s@xmath23 .",
    "we , therefore , estimate the time it took the shock to transverse the area associated with b1 to be no more than about 1400 yrs . molecular gas heated by a shock with a velocity of about 30  km",
    "s@xmath23 takes a few hundred years to cool down below 100 k ( bergin et al .",
    "1998 ) . hence",
    ", the gas in the b1 region has been above 100  k for no more than 2000 yrs .",
    "the b1 region is hot enough for grain mantles to evaporate and it is dense enough for gas - phase chemical reactions that result in complex molecules to occur ( e.g. , millar et al .",
    "1991 ) . however , gas - phase models predict the maximum abundance of complex molecules in the gas to occur between a few @xmath13 yrs and a few @xmath6 yrs after the parent molecules are released into the gas phase ( see millar et al .",
    "1991 ) considerably longer than the timescale estimated above and the maximum abundance of hcooch@xmath0 predicted by these models is a factor of ten less than our observed abundance .",
    "moreover , recent results by horn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicate that gas - phase production of hcooch@xmath0 is much less efficient than previously considered by gas - phase models .",
    "it is highly improbable that most of the observed complex molecules in the l1157 outflow are produced in the gas phase .",
    "we therefore conclude that the relatively high abundance of complex molecules in the l1157 outflow is better explained by the formation of these species on the grain surface and their subsequent release into the gas phase caused by the outflow shock .",
    "we note that our results do not discard the possibility of small differences in the formation mechanism of these molecules , and that a small fraction of some of the species may exist in the gas phase independent of outflow shocks .",
    "for example , hcooh has been observed in a quiescent dark cloud , yet hcooch@xmath0 has only been observed in active regions ( turner et al .  1999 ; requena - torres et al .",
    "the derived hcooh abundance in these studies is about @xmath36 , two orders of magnitude smaller than our abundance estimates in l1157 .",
    "hence , only a negligible fraction of the complex species observed in l1157 could be due to processes unrelated to the outflow shock .",
    "recent surveys of abundances of complex species in hot cores , hot corinos , ( the presumed low - mass counterparts of hot cores ) , and molecular clouds in the galactic center ( gc ) region favor the grain surface formation scenario ( e.g. , bottinelli et al . 2007 ; bisschop et al . 2007 ; requena - torres et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "the abundance ratio of the complex molecules with respect to ch@xmath0oh ( another , more abundant , grain mantle constituent ) can be used to investigate the origin and evolution of these complex species ( e.g. , bottinelli et al .",
    "2007 ) . using the abundance of ch@xmath0oh in b1 reported by bp97 ( about @xmath37 ) , we derive the abundance ratios hcooch@xmath0/ch@xmath0oh , hcooh / ch@xmath0oh , c@xmath1h@xmath2oh / ch@xmath0oh , and ch@xmath0cn / ch@xmath0oh to be in the order of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath39 , and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the first three are in agreement ( within an order of magnitude ) with the average abundance ratios found in hot cores and molecular clouds in the gc region ( requena - torres et al .  2006 ; bisschop et al .",
    "2007 ) , and are also consistent with the upper limits obtained toward the l1448 outflow by requena - torres et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . taken together these results suggest the dust in hot cores , gc molecular clouds , and the l1157 molecular cloud have similar mantle composition ( as also argued by requena - torres et al .  2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "in hot corinos , unlike the other sources , the abundance of hcooch@xmath0 and hcooh with respect to methanol is two orders of magnitude higher that in the b1 position of l1157 .",
    "such high relative abundance in hot corinos could be due to a longer warm - up phase of the gas surrounding low - mass protostars , when complex species are produced relatively more efficiently ( garrod & herbst 2006 ) .",
    "the ch@xmath0cn to ch@xmath0oh ratio is significantly lower by about three orders of magnitude for b1 than for hot cores and hot corinos ( it has not been measured for gc clouds ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the low ch@xmath0cn / ch@xmath0oh in b1 could be that processes in the shocked region ( but not present in hot cores or hot corinos ) rapidly destroy ch@xmath0cn once it is in the gas phase .",
    "it is also possible that ch@xmath0cn is truly a daughter specie and it shows very low abundance because there has not been enough time ( @xmath40 yr ) for large abundances of this molecule to form in the warm gas associated with b1 . with our current data we can not confidently state",
    "which scenario is more likely and further observations are needed .",
    "similar abundance ratios of a number of molecules in the l1157 outflow ( and in hot cores ) compared to the abundance ratio of molecules in the comet hale - bopp led bockele - morvan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to argue that there is a direct link between cometary and interstellar ices .",
    "the estimates of hcooch@xmath0/ch@xmath0oh and hcooh / ch@xmath0oh we obtain for l1157 are roughly similar to those of hale - bopp",
    ". our results are consistent with the conclusions reached by bockele - morvan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that molecules in cometary ices could have formed by processes very similar to those that produce the chemically rich icy mantles on interstellar grains .    in summary ,",
    "our results clearly indicate that in molecular clouds with only low - mass star formation complex organic molecules can form through grain surface reactions .",
    "outflow shocks can heat the surrounding medium and evaporate the icy grain mantles where the complex species reside , thereby releasing them into the gas phase and chemically enriching the circumstellar environment .",
    "our results show that a protostar s radiation is not the sole mechanism that can generate complex molecules near forming stars and that the impact of outflows needs to be considered when studying complex species around protostars .",
    "if no subsequent chemical reactions alter the abundance of complex molecules once they are released into the gas phase by the shock , then the abundance estimates from millimeter observations can be used to study the mantle composition of the dust in the cloud . comparing the results from our observations of the b1 clump in the l1157 outflow with those of other regions observed by others suggest that the grain mantle composition in the l1157 dark cloud is comparable to that of the grains in hot cores and molecular clouds in the galactic center region .",
    "observations of more complex molecules and estimates of their relative abundance towards other chemically active outflows will allow us to determine the reliability of millimeter observations of shocked molecular gas for estimating the abundance of complex molecules in grains and if similar grain mantle compositions are found in different regions of low - mass star formation .",
