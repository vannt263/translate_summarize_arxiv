    ", have been discovered inside young snrs .",
    "such sources , possibly the youngest members of the family of radio - quiet , isolated neutron stars ( including also the anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters ) , were dubbed , as a class , `` central compact objects '' ( ccos , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "what makes 1e 1613 unique among ccos is its very peculiar and puzzling temporal behaviour .",

    "chandra_/acis observations which showed that the source brightened by a factor @xmath760 between september 1999 ( when the source s flux was @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 in the 0.5 - 8 kev energy range ) and february 2000 ( with a record flux of @xmath11 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 ) , decreasing to @xmath12 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 @xcite afterwards .",

    "1e 1613 could be a very young binary system , composed of a recently born compact object and of a low - mass star in an eccentric orbit , powered by an unusual `` double '' ( wind+disc ) accretion mechanism .",
    "very recently , a different binary scenario for 1e 1613 has been proposed by @xcite . alternatively , 1e 1613 could be a peculiar isolated object , e.g. a magnetar , dramatically slowed - down , possibly by interaction with a debris disc ( de luca et al .",

    "both the binary system and the isolated object scenario are highly unusual and require non - standard assumptions about the formation and evolution of compact objects in supernova explosions .    in order to shed light on the nature of the puzzling source 1e 1613 , we have performed new , deep ir observations of the field with the _ vlt _ , with the main aim of identifying the source counterpart by means of a sensitive search for modulation at the expected 6.67 hour periodicity .",

    "since a precise position is of paramount importance for our counterpart search , we have first reassessed 1e 1613 x - ray position using a set of chandra archival data together with a very recent deep chandra observation performed by our group (  2 ) .",

    "almost all data collected before 2002 are of little use to derive the source position owing to the presence of offsets in the astrometry , as computed by the _ aspect tool _ , and/or to source pile - up .",
    "indeed , we found discrepancies among the reconstructed target coordinates , much larger than the expected astrometric accuracy .",
    "thus , we decided to rely only on chandra data collected after 2002 , for which no astrometric offsets are reported .",
    "such data include 12 short ( 4 - 5 ks ) observations with acis / s @xcite as well as a very recent , deep ( 80 ks ) observation performed with hrc / s by our group .",

    "the chandra / acis astrometric accuracy for sources at offaxis angles larger than 3 arcmin is degraded with respect to the on - axis case because of psf blurring , but no systematic studies of such an effect are available .",

    "object # 7 is not included since it is not detected in the single images but only in the co - added one ( see fig .",
    "[ charts ] ) . next , for each measurement , we computed the corresponding phase with respect to the 6.67 hours x - ray period , assuming phase 0 to be at mjd 53879.0 and we folded the second night on the first one .",
    "the folded light curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ naco_lc ] ( right panel ) .",
    "a large scatter of the flux measurements is apparent in both panels of fig .",
    "[ naco_lc ] , where error bars account for statistical errors only .",
    "such a variability is generally erratic and not correlated with phase ( fig .",
    "[ naco_lc ] ) . indeed , visual inspection of the light curves of object # 1 and # 3 would suggest a nearly sinusoidal variation , which , however , does not pass statistical tests .",
    "considering source # 1 , a simple constant fails to reproduce the folded light curve ( @xmath73 , 18 d.o.f . ) . adding a @xmath74 function",
    "does not yield a better description ( @xmath75 , 16 d.o.f . ;",
    "such improvement has a 20% chance occurrence probability ) ; adding a second harmonic does not improve the situation ( @xmath76 , 14 d.o.f . ) .",
    "focusing on source # 3 , a constant fit yields @xmath77 ( 15 d.o.f . ) , while adding a @xmath74 function yields @xmath78 ( 13 d.o.f . ) .",
    "such an improvement has a chance occurrence probability of 3% , which is definitely too high to claim for evidence of modulation .",
    "thus , none of the candidate counterparts show evidence for periodic modulation .    in order to estimate upper limits on short - term variability , a careful discussion of errors",
    "is required .",
    "indeed , the apparent flux variations exceed the expected poisson fluctuations among different measurements . a steady flux model is formally not consistent with most of the observed light curves ( as seen above , e.g. , for object 1 it yields @xmath79 , 18 d.o.f . ) .",
    "such a large scatter suggests that our relative photometry measurements are contaminated by random errors induced e.g. , by fluctuations in the atmospheric conditions , sky background and seeing .",
    "other sources of errors are the variations in the ao correction to the image psf , which depend both on the objects positions in the instrument field of view and on the correct guiding of the reference star .",
    "furthermore , errors are also induced by the psf fitting and background subtraction procedures .",
    "other errors induced by the data reduction process and/or by glitches in the detector performance should also to be taken into account .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the brightest source candidate ( object # 2 , @xmath41=15.5 ) shows a much smaller r.m.s . with respect to the other , much fainter ones ( @xmath80 ) , implying that such errors are larger for sources with a lower signal to noise ratio .",
    "since it would be extremely difficult to formally quantify all the above effects on the photometry of each single object , we decided to use an empirical approach .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] where , for all objects detected in the field , we have plotted the flux variation r.m.s . as a function of the average object s flux . as already hinted in fig .",
    "[ naco_lc ] , flux measurements for fainter sources are more scattered .",
    "in particular , the flux variation r.m.s of our candidate counterparts are fully consistent with those of field objects of comparable brightness .",
    "thus , we conclude that none of the candidate counterparts shows evidence for a significant short - term variability , nor of a significant 6.67 hour modulation . indeed , the measured flux variation r.m.s .",
    "can be interpreted as a @xmath31 upper limit to any possible variability .",
    "such upper limits , together with the time - averaged magnitudes , are summarized in table [ tab : rms ] .    for completeness",
    ", we have analyzed the other available datasets which span different epochs and sample different source states .",
    "we have repeated our analysis using the _ vlt_/_isaac _",
    "@xmath51-band dataset ( see table [ isaacdata ] ) which , unfortunately , provides repeated flux measurements only for the two brightest candidates ( objects # 1 and 2 ) with non - continuous coverage and non - unifourm sampling of the 6.67 hours x - ray period .",
    "we found that the apparent flux variations are compatible with the measured r.m.s . , suggesting that , also in this case , random errors induced by fluctuations in the atmospheric conditions , sky background and seeing , dominate .",
    "as before , we assumed the measured flux variation r.m.s .",
    "as the @xmath31 variability upper limit ( see table [ tab : rms ] ) .",
    "finally , we have repeated our analysis using the _ hst_/_nicmos _",
    "@xmath60 dataset which provides repeated , atmosphere - free flux measurements although with non - continuous coverage and non - uniform sampling of the 6.67 hours x - ray period ( see table [ nicmosdata ] ) . since the _ hst_observations have been split in two different orbits separated by about 60 days , we first searched for variability in each visit .",
    "once more , we could not find statistically significant evidence for variability .",
    "in particular , we found none for object # 7 , i.e. the faintest of the candidates and the only one for which the repeated _ vlt_/_naco_observations did not yield time variability information . while the uncertainty on the source period prevents folding of the light curves derived from different visits , by comparing the photometry of the two visits we found that the fluxes measured from the second one are systematically fainter by @xmath81 magnitudes .",
    "such an effect is most probably due to the use of calibration frames non contemporaneous to the observations ( unfortunately , a single set of dark and flatfield frames is available for the two visits ) and , possibly , to a non - optimal correction for the `` pedestal '' ( see nicmos instrument handbook ) .",
    "the derived variability upper limits ( see table [ tab : rms ] ) are thus less constraining than those derived from the single visits , although , as expected , somewhat tighter than those derived from the analysis of the _ vlt_/_naco _  and _ isaac _  datasets .",
    "we have used the whole dataset to search for indications of long term , ir variability on time scale of years , possibly associated to the evolution of the x - ray source . as a reference",

    "passband transformations between the _ hst _  filters and the johnson s ones can be computed using the _ synphot _ package of the space telescope science data analysis software ( stsdas ) .",
    "however , the results are affected by the uncertainty on the objects spectral type which is a free parameter of the transformation equation . since our spectral classification of the candidate counterparts relies mostly on one colour , with only objects # 1 and 2",

    "* ) .      in the frame of the binary system scenario for 1e 1613 @xcite , in principle",
    ", one could expect the companion star to be significantly different from a main sequence star of comparable mass",
    ". this could be the result of an early phase of irradiation by photons and charged particles from the newborn neutron star , which could have left the companion away from thermal equilibrium ( kelvin - helmoltz time scale to thermal relaxation would be much larger than the age of the system ) .",
    "tidal interaction along a very eccentric orbit could also play some role .",
    "however , the hypothesis that any of the possible candidates be the companion of 1e 1613 is very unlikely .",
    "the observed colors and magnitudes would require an unrealistically low temperature for the star ( @xmath102 k ) , implying ( at a distance of 3.3 kpc and for a@xmath103 ) , a photospheric radius of ( 1 - 2)@xmath104 cm , exceeding the roche lobe dimension ( @xmath105 cm , assuming a 1.4 m@xmath106 neutron star , a 0.5 m@xmath106 companion and an orbital period of 6.67 hours ) and comparable to the system orbital separation ( @xmath107 cm under the same assumptions ) .    within the isolated magnetar scenario @xcite , a fallback disc is required in order to quench the neutron star rotation to a period of 6.67 hours in @xmath2 yr .",
    "could one of the possible candidates be the fallback disc itself ?",

    "* ) . while the physics of the possible disc surrounding axp 4u 0142 + 61 is not understood ( passive or viscous ? *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we note that the colors of our candidates are similar to the case of 4u 0142 + 61 , but their f@xmath108/f@xmath5 ratio ( in the range 0.7 - 2@xmath109 at the epoch of the naco observations ) is about one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the upper limits to the far ir emission set by @xcite are not constraining .",
    "unfortunately , mostly because of the faintness of the ir sources , results of the temporal analysis could not offer conclusive clues .",
    "the upper limits we could set do not put stringent constraints",
    ". they could be consistent with a binary scenario , since any orbital modulation would obviously depend on the inclination of the system with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "on the other side , the isolated neutron star scenario does not allow for firm predictions about a possible ir periodicity .",
    "we also tried to exploit the source long - term fading seen in x - rays between the nicmos and the naco observations looking for long - term variability to pinpoint the ir counterpart of 1e 1613 . in the binary scenario",
    ", ir variability could be due to the reprocessing of the compact source x - ray radiation by the companion star ( and possibly by an accretion disc , if any ) .",
    "the same could be true for the isolated magnetar scenario , x - ray reprocessing taking place in a fallback disc .",
    "we stress , yet again , that in both pictures the effect would be strongly dependent on the geometry of the system with respect to the line of sight .",
    "indeed , we obtained evidence for a possible @xmath110 mag fading of one of the candidates , which yields a constant f@xmath108/f@xmath5 ratio in case of association to 1e 1613 .",
    "however , in view of the scatter seen in the correlation of nicmos and naco photometric measurements for sources of comparable magnitude , such a possible evidence for ir variability is not strong enough to claim an identification .      considering the binary scenario , accounting for uncertainties on the distance and reddening ,",
    "such upper limit is only consistent with an m6-m8 dwarf , i.e. a very underluminous companion .",
    "it is rather unlikely that such a small star may power the mechanism proposed by @xcite , where accretion of wind from the companion ",
    "modulated along an eccentric orbit  explains the phenomenology of the low state .",
    "such a picture would require an accretion rate of @xmath111 , implying a red dwarf wind mass loss larger by at least a factor of a few , which seems somewhat too high for such a small star .",
    "thus , an alternative process is required to explain the x - ray phenomenology .",
    "even the survival to the supernova explosion of a binary system with such an extreme mass ratio seems problematic .",
    "it would require an ad - hoc kick for the neutron star to avoid disruption of the system . on the other side ,",
    "the lack of an ir counterpart fits well within the isolated magnetar scenario .",
    "the upper limit to the ratio f@xmath108/f@xmath112 ( at the epoch of the naco observation ) is fully consistent with the values observed for all magnetars identified in the ir ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite . in the isolated magnetar scenario , we can not rule out the possibility that one of the candidate sources be the residual disc surrounding 1e 1613 .",
    "however , occam s razor argues against such a conclusion , since all possible candidates are undistinguishable from normal , background stars .",
    "recent swift monitoring of 1e 1613 shows that the x - ray source continued to fade in the 2006 - 2007 time interval and that its flux is approaching the 1999 , pre - outburst level ( see fig .",
    "[ multi_lc ] ) .",
    "historical observations point to a large flux variability over a @xmath113 yr time scale @xcite , so that a rebrightening is likely to occur .",
    "a factor @xmath114 increase in the x - ray luminosity ( as in the 1999 - 2000 outburst ) would yield a dramatic change in the irradiation of any possible object / structure ( companion star / fallback disc ) linked to 1e 1613 .",
    "thus , if a new outburst from 1e 1613 will occur , a fast follow - up in the ir will be crucial in order to conclusively address the issue of the ir counterpart for 1e 1613 and to shed light on its nature .",
    "the images described in this work will be a reference to search for variability of the counterpart .",
