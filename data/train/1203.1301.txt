    "channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) is an important issue when designing communication systems , and can be available in a variety of forms .",
    "consider the following csit models for a two user miso broadcast channel ( bc ) where the transmitter is equipped with two antennas , each receiver has one antenna and the channels vary in an i.i.d .",
    "fashion across time .    1 .",
    "* perfect current csit : * this is the setting where the transmitter knows the instantaneous channels perfectly at time @xmath0 .",
    "* delayed csit : * this is the setting where at time @xmath0 , the transmitter knows the channels up to time @xmath1 perfectly .",
    "3 .   * delayed csit and imperfect current csit : * this is the setting where the transmitter has delayed csit and also has partial knowledge of the channels at time @xmath0 .",
    "when the channel is changing very slowly , perfect current csit is a reasonable assumption . under this model ,",
    "zero forcing at the transmitter allows each user to achieve 1 dof which is also its interference - free dof . on the other hand , if the channel is changing very rapidly , delayed csit is a reasonable assumption .",
    "a channel that changes from symbol to symbol in an i.i.d.fashion , making any csit completely outdated ( i.e. , independent of the current channel state ) , naturally represents a worst case scenario .",
    "surprisingly , even in this case , a dof gain can be obtained due to retrospective interference alignment @xcite , @xcite . for many practical settings , however ,",
    "at least some imperfect knowledge of current channel state may be available in addition to the past channel state information .",
    "this can happen , e.g. , due to temporal channel correlations when the csit feedback is not too delayed , or , e.g. , due to the availability of a feedback channel with significant delay ( providing outdated csit ) in addition to the observations from a reverse channel ( due to the two - way nature of communication ) which may provide an ( imperfect ) estimate of the current channel state . in this work",
    "we explore how the transmitter can _ optimally _ use this mixed csit , from a dof perspective .",
    "we consider a two user miso broadcast channel where the transmitter has two antennas .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitter has perfect delayed csi and imperfect current csi .",
    "we are interested in characterizing the dof of this channel .",
    "to better understand the results , we present the channel model in its simplest form as follows .",
    "the rationale for this simple form will be explained in detail in section [ sec : simplemodel ] .     ,",
    "width=336 ]    @xmath2    here , during channel use @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the received signal at receiver @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and finite variance at receiver @xmath4 , @xmath6 is the projection of the transmitted signal along the dimension that is orthogonal to the estimated current channel of receiver 2 while @xmath7 is the projection of the transmitted signal along the dimension that is orthogonal to the estimated current channel of receiver 1 .",
    "essentially , by a change of basis operation ( no loss of generality for dof ) , the effective transmit antennas are aligned with the zero forcing signaling dimensions based on the imperfect current csit . since the current channel is not known perfectly , perfect zero - forcing of signals",
    "is not possible , so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the channels for the non - zero - forced part of the signals .",
    "they are modeled as unknown channel coefficients at time @xmath0 , and will be known to the transmitter after a significant delay ( outdated csit ) . due to imperfect current csit , @xmath10 represents the residual signal power after zero forcing , whose strength is measured by @xmath11 , a parameter that ranges between zero and one .",
    "when @xmath12 , it corresponds to the case when current csit is as good as perfect , because the residual signal power after zero forcing is at the noise floor level and has no impact on dof . in this case",
    ", simply zero - forcing allows each user to achieve 1 dof , for a total of 2 dof which is also the maximum dof of the channel even with perfect current csit . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath13 , it corresponds to the case when there is no current csit , and zero - forcing is not able to reduce the signal strength . in this case ,",
    "maddah - ali and tse proposed an interference alignment scheme ( which will be referred to as the mat scheme ) to achieve the optimal dof of @xmath14 @xcite .    for @xmath15",
    ", zero - forcing , which only uses current csi , achieves @xmath16 dof , while the mat scheme , which only uses delayed csi , achieves @xmath17 dof regardless of @xmath11 .",
    "recently , in @xcite , kobayashi et al . proposed an interesting scheme which exploits both current and delayed csi to achieve @xmath18 dof used in this paper is different from that used in @xcite .",
    "as will be explained in the following part of the paper , suppose we denote the @xmath11 used in @xcite as @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath11 in this paper is related to @xmath19 through @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xcite . the achievable dof curve of @xcite",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dof ] . in this work ,",
    "we build our scheme upon that of kobayashi et al . and further improve it to achieve @xmath21 dof , which represents a straight line that goes from a sum dof value of 2 when @xmath12 to a sum dof value of @xmath17 when @xmath13 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dof ] .",
    "the new achievable scheme provides the largest dof gain of @xmath22 over best of zf and mat schemes at @xmath23 .",
    "we also derive a dof outer bound for the mixed csit setting , where no non - trivial outer bound was previously available , to show that @xmath21 dof is in fact _",
    "optimal_. in addition to being tight , the outer bound possesses another robust feature  it does not force the i.i.d .",
    "assumption across users , i.e. , the users can have different channel distributions .",
    "in contrast , the assumption of statistically equivalent fading for all users is used for the original outer bound derived for the miso broadcast channel with only delayed csit @xcite .",
    "therefore , apparently even in the original setting of only delayed csit , our result further strengthens the result of @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we provide an intuitive description of our achievable scheme .",
    "since our scheme is built upon that of @xcite ( which is built upon @xcite ) , we first review the scheme in @xcite .      following the principle of mat scheme , in the scheme of kobayashi et al .",
    "also , the interference initially seen at each receiver is multicast to both receivers in subsequent transmission phases , such that the undesired receiver can cancel the previously seen interference while the desired receiver can use this additional observation to resolve its desired symbols . however , unlike mat scheme which assumes no knowledge of current channel state , kobayashi et al .",
    "also simultaneously take advantage of the partial zero forcing capability provided by the imperfect current csit .",
    "specifically , the scheme consists of three phases .    in the first phase , which consists of one time slot , the transmitter simultaneously sends four symbols @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are intended for receiver 1 and @xmath26",
    "are intended for receiver 2 .",
    "the symbols @xmath27 and @xmath28 exploit the partial zero forcing capability , as they are sent along the directions that are orthogonal to the imperfectly known current channel states of receiver 2 and 1 , respectively . due to",
    "partial zero - forcing , @xmath29 are received with full power @xmath30 at the desired receivers , but only at power @xmath10 at the undesired receivers .",
    "having exhausted the partial zero - forcing capability with @xmath31 , the transmitter simultaneously sends @xmath32 and @xmath33 along generic directions to guarantee linear independence with @xmath29 .",
    "however , @xmath34 are allocated less power ) , ( [ eq : model2 ] ) , the power allocated to @xmath34 is simply @xmath35 so that the dominant received power term from these symbols is @xmath36 at both receivers , and the choice of generic directions simply implies transmission from both antennas with different linear weights . ] so that they are received at power level @xmath36 at both receivers .",
    "note that this is the same power level as @xmath27 and @xmath28 at the _ undesired _ receivers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rx1t1_intro ] , @xmath28 and @xmath33 are received at the same power level @xmath10 at receiver @xmath37 , as is @xmath32 .    in the next phase , the transmitter wants to deliver the linear combination of @xmath28 and @xmath33 seen by receiver 1 and that of @xmath27 and @xmath32 seen by receiver 2 to both receivers . a key novel idea of @xcite is to _ quantize _ the interference and then multicast it to both receivers digitally instead of directly sending the analog interference signal as the mat scheme .",
    "now consider quantizing the interference given by the linear combination of @xmath28 and @xmath33 at receiver 1 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rx1t1_intro ] , since @xmath38 have power @xmath10 at receiver 1 , the linear combination can be quantized to within unit approximation error using approximately @xmath39 bits .",
    "these bits will be coded using a multicast code and then be sent to both receivers . since the channel has 1 dof for multicast to both receivers , i.e. , rate @xmath40 for sending common information , the number of time slots needed to send these bits is approximately @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , in the third phase the transmitter will use @xmath11 time slots to multicast the quantized linear combination of @xmath27 and @xmath32 seen by receiver 2 in the first time slot . as a consequence , combining all three phases , after @xmath41 time slots each user can decode two desired symbols to achieve @xmath42 dof .",
    "our scheme also consists of three phases .",
    "the main reason for the improvement is that while the scheme of kobayashi et al .",
    "uses the partial zero forcing capability of the channel only in phase 1 , our scheme uses the partial zero forcing capability in _ every _ transmission .",
    "phase 1 of our scheme is the same as that of kobayashi et al . in @xcite . for the second phase , just like kobayashi et al . , we also multicast the common information ( denoted by @xmath43 in fig . [",
    "fig : t2_intro ] ) which is simply the quantization of the linear combination of @xmath28 and @xmath33 seen by receiver 1 .",
    "however , unlike the scheme of kobayashi et al .",
    ", in addition to multicasting this common information , _ we also simultaneously send two new private messages _",
    ", one for each receiver using the partial zero forcing capability of the channel .",
    "denote these additional symbols for receiver 1 and 2 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath44 and @xmath45 are sent from @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , in and @xmath48 , i.e. , they are sent along the imperfectly known zero - forcing directions .",
    "moreover , we allocate only enough power to @xmath49 such that they are received at noise floor level at the unintended receivers . from and @xmath48 ,",
    "it can be seen the allocated power is @xmath50 . with this power allocation",
    ", they will be received at the power level @xmath51 at the desired receivers .",
    "the power levels of symbols at two receivers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t2_intro ] .",
    "each receiver will decode the common information @xmath43 first , subtract it out and then decode the private message . due to the private message ,",
    "the noise level for the common message is raised to @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the common message can achieve a rate approximately @xmath52 .",
    "each private message can achieve a rate approximately @xmath53 .",
    "since the common message contains @xmath39 bits , only one time slot is need to deliver it .",
    "the third phase is similar to second phase , i.e. , we send the common information , @xmath54 , carrying the quantized linear combination of @xmath27 and @xmath32 as seen by receiver 2 in the first time slot , and two private messages , @xmath55 , one for each receiver .",
    "the remaining details are the same as phase 2 .    as a consequence , over 3 time slots ,",
    "each user can decode four desired symbols to achieve @xmath56 dof .",
    "we also provide an information theoretic outer bound that proves this dof value is optimal .",
    "the dof value can be written as @xmath57 and can be interpreted as ",
    "_ each user can achieve @xmath58 dof due to retrospective interference alignment and @xmath59 dof due to zero - forcing . _ \"",
    "we follow a similar model to kobayashi et al . @xcite , except that we assume i.i.d .",
    "temporal variations .",
    "the channel input - output relationship at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath3 is the observed signal at receiver @xmath4 , @xmath61^t$ ] is the @xmath62 input signal satisfying the power constraint @xmath63\\leq p$ ] and @xmath64 is the circularly symmetric complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two @xmath62 channel vectors to receiver 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the estimated channels while @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the estimation errors .",
    "we assume that @xmath72 are drawn from continuous distributions , independent of each other ( although not necessarily identically distributed ) , and vary in an i.i.d .",
    "fashion in time .    the estimated channels and estimation errors",
    "are assumed to be zero mean with covariance matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , respectively .",
    "receivers know the instantaneous channels perfectly .",
    "regarding the channel state information at the transmitter , it is assumed that the transmitter has 1 ) perfect delayed csi and 2 ) imperfect current csi , i.e. , at time @xmath0 the transmitter knows perfectly @xmath76 and @xmath77 as well as @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we define @xmath78 essentially , the parameter @xmath19 measures the quality of the current channel estimation .",
    "if @xmath79 , then it corresponds to the case when there is no current csi . if @xmath80 , then it corresponds to the case that the current csi is as good as perfect ( for dof ) .",
    "note that in @xcite , the definition of @xmath19 is slightly different from our definition where @xmath19 is defined as @xmath81 .",
    "there are two independent messages , one for each receiver .",
    "we denote the size of message @xmath82 as @xmath83 , @xmath84 . for the codewords spanning @xmath85 channel uses , the rates @xmath86 are achievable if the probability of error for both messages can be simultaneously made arbitrarily small by choosing an appropriately large @xmath85 .",
    "the sum capacity @xmath87 is the maximum achievable sum rate .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is defined as @xmath88    note that there is a subtle thematic distinction between this work and that of kobayashi et al . in",
    "that our focus is limited to optimal use of current and outdated channel information whereas kobayashi et al .",
    "also incorporate temporal correlations .",
    "the thematic distinction leads to slightly different channel models .",
    "while kobayashi et al . deal with additional complexities of temporal correlations and non - ergodic settings , we are able to ignore temporal correlations ( i.i.d . fading in time ) while capturing the essential aspect of availability of both current and outdated channel knowledge . while our model is simpler than @xcite in ignoring temporal correlations , and closer to the original model of @xcite , we expect that from a dof perspective the two models will produce equivalent results and shed similar insights into the same essential question that motivates the two works .",
    "next we justify the equivalence of the model presented above ( along the lines of kobayashi et al . ) and the simpler model in ( [ eq : model1 ] ) , ( [ eq : model2 ] ) used for the overview in the introduction section .",
    "we can perform a sequence of invertible operations at transmitter and receivers to convert the channel to its simplest form . since invertible transformations do not affect the dof of the channel",
    ", there is no loss of generality , i.e. , the resulting channel has the same dof as the original channel .",
    "first , we perform an invertible linear transformation at the transmitter .",
    "this is done by multiplying a @xmath89 invertible matrix @xmath90 $ ] to the transmitted signal , i.e. , @xmath91 where @xmath61^t$ ] is the original channel input vector . @xmath92 and @xmath93 are unit norm vectors chosen in a manner that they are orthogonal to @xmath69 and @xmath68 , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "the received signals at receiver 1 and 2 become @xmath94 then receiver @xmath4 can normalize the channel coefficient of @xmath95 to unity such that the channel becomes @xmath96 now let us define @xmath97 and @xmath98 , both of which have covariance matrix @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , we normalize the transmit power to unity by absorbing it into the channel coefficients and defining @xmath100 . then the channel input - output relationship can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 have finite variances independent of @xmath30 and they are only known to the transmitter with one time delay . by setting @xmath20 and with a little bit of abuse of notations , we end up with the following simple channel model : @xmath102 since @xmath19 is defined to be greater than or equal to zero and @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath104 , the problem becomes trivial .",
    "it can be easily seen that simply zero - forcing at the transmitter can achieve 2 dof which is also the maximum achievable dof .",
    "therefore , we only consider the case when @xmath105 in this section .",
    "the main result of this paper is presented in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : innerbound ] for the miso broadcast channel with mixed csit defined in section [ sec : systemmodel ] , @xmath106    this theorem establishes both the achievable dof and its optimality . in terms of outer bounds",
    ", this is the first non - trivial outer bound for the mixed csit setting .",
    "however , the result is interesting even in the original setting of @xcite with only delayed csit , i.e. , with no current csit .",
    "this is because our outer bound does _ not _ require that the two users are statistically equivalent , i.e. , the users can have different fading distributions .",
    "in contrast , the outer bounds for bc with delayed csit , e.g. , in @xcite , require that two users are statistically equivalent .",
    "therefore , evidently we have a stronger result in the original setting as well .",
    "in this section , we provide the outer bound proof . we start first with the original setting of @xcite with only delayed csit and provide an alternate proof that does not require statistically equivalent fading for the two users .",
    "our outer bound follows a compound channel approach .      consider the following bc with delayed csit as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 for simplicity we omit the time index .",
    "recall that we assume the channels are i.i.d . in time and independent across users but not necessarily identically distributed across users .",
    "now suppose we provide @xmath108 to user 2 so that it has both @xmath109 , which makes the channel physically degraded .",
    "for a physically degraded bc without memory ( this requirement of memoryless channels is the primary reason that we restrict the model to i.i.d . fading in time )",
    ", feedback does not increase capacity , so we can eliminate the delayed csit feedback for this new channel .",
    "now , let us impose a compound setting on @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which is consistent with the outer bound argument , i.e. the compound setting does not decrease the capacity of the original channel . to see this ,",
    "suppose we first introduce another pair of receivers , one for each user , that are statistically equivalent to the original receivers and require the same messages . since the additional receivers have the same decoding capabilities as the original receivers , the capacity region is not decreased .",
    "now we provide full channel knowledge to the transmitter , which also can not reduce capacity ( this step is not necessary , but it shows the strength of the outer bound ) .",
    "this puts us into a two state compound bc setting . since at no point did we reduce the capacity , the outer bound for this compound setting is also an outer bound for the original channel .",
    "so now we have two more fictional outputs : @xmath112 note that in the compound setting the transmitter knows that the channel vectors can be either @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",
    "essentially now we have two bcs controlled by the same inputs . in the first bc ,",

    ", we proceed as follows .",

    "note that the bound only requires linear independence between the two realizations .",
    "since the channels are drawn from a continuous distribution , this is true with probability 1",
