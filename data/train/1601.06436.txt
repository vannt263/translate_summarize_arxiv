    "on the 25-th of november in 1915 , einstein presented his field equations , the basic equations of general relativity , to the prussian academy of sciences in berlin .",
    "this equation had a tremendous impact on physics , in particular on cosmology .",
    "the essence of the theory was expressed by wheeler by the words : _ spacetime tells matter how to move ; matter tells spacetime how to curve_. einsteins theory remained unchanged for about 40 years .",
    "then one started to investigate theories fulfilling mach s principle leading to a variable gravitational constant .",
    "brans - dicke theory was the first realization of an extended einstein theory with variable gravitational constant ( jordans proposal was not widely known ) .",
    "all experiments are , however , in good agreement with einstein s theory and currently there is no demand to change it .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) has changed our understanding of space - time . in parallel ,",
    "the appearance of quantum field theory ( qft ) has modified our view of particles , fields and the measurement process .",
    "the usual approach for the unification of qft and gr to a quantum gravity , starts with a proposal to quantize gr and its underlying structure , space - time .",
    "there is a unique opinion in the community about the relation between geometry and quantum theory : the geometry as used in gr is classical and should emerge from a quantum gravity in the limit ( planck s constant tends to zero ) .",
    "most theories went a step further and try to get a space - time from quantum theory .",
    "then , the model of a smooth manifold is not suitable to describe quantum gravity , but there is no sign for a discrete space - time structure or higher dimensions in current experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that the model of spacetime as a smooth 4-manifold can be used also in a quantum gravity regime , but then one has the problem to represent qft by geometric methods ( submanifolds for particles or fields etc . ) as well to quantize gr .",
    "in particular , one must give meaning to the quantum state by geometric methods .",
    "then one is able to construct the quantum theory without quantization .",
    "here we implicitly assumed that the quantum state is real , i.e. the quantum state or the wave function has a real counterpart and is not a collection of future possibilities representing some observables .",
    "experiments @xcite supported this view .",
    "then the wave function is not merely representing our limited knowledge of a system but it is in direct correspondence to reality ! then one has to go the reverse way : one has to show that the quantum state is produced by the quantization of a classical state .",
    "it is , however , not enough to have a geometric approach to quantum gravity ( or the quantum field theory in general ) .",
    "what are the quantum fluctuations ?",
    "what is the measurement process ?",
    "what is decoherence and entanglement ? in principle , all these questions have to be addressed too .    here",
    ", the exotic smoothness structure of 4-manifolds can help finding a way .",
    "a lot of work was done in the last decades to fulfill this goal .",
    "it starts with the work of brans and randall @xcite and of brans alone @xcite where the special situation in exotic 4-manifolds ( in particular the exotic @xmath0 ) was explained .",
    "one main result of this time was the _ brans conjecture _ : exotic smoothness can serve as an additional source of gravity .",
    "i will not present the whole history where i refer to carl s article . here",
    "i will list only some key results which will be used in the following    * exotic smoothness is an extra source of gravity ( brans conjecture is true ) , see asselmeyer @xcite for compact manifolds and sadkowski @xcite for the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "therefore an exotic @xmath0 is always curved and can not be flat ! * the exotic @xmath0 can not be a globally hyperbolic space ( see @xcite for instance ) , i.e. represented by @xmath2 for some 3-manifold .",
    "instead it admits complicated foliations @xcite .",
    "using non - commutative geometry , we are able to study these foliations ( the leaf space ) and get relations to qft . for instance , the von neumann algebra of a codimension - one foliation of an exotic @xmath0 must contain a factor of type @xmath3 used in local algebraic qft to describe the vacuum @xcite . *",
    "the end of @xmath0 ( the part extending to infinity ) is @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath0 is exotic then @xmath4 admits also an exotic smoothness structure .",
    "clearly , there is always a topologically embedded 3-sphere but there is no smoothly embedded one .",
    "let us assume the well - known hyperbolic metric of the spacetime @xmath4 using the trivial foliation into leafs @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "now we demand that @xmath4 carries an exotic smoothness structure at the same time .",
    "then we will get only topologically embedded 3-spheres , the leafs @xmath5 .",
    "these topologically embedded 3-spheres are also known as wild 3-spheres . in @xcite",
    ", we presented a relation to quantum d - branes .",
    "finally we proved in @xcite that the deformation quantization of a tame embedding ( the usual embedding ) is a wild embedding so that the image @xmath7 is an infinite polyhedron or the triangulation needs always infinitely many simplices . ] .",
    "furthermore we obtained a geometric interpretation of quantum states : wild embedded submanifolds are quantum states .",
    "importantly , this construction depends essentially on the continuum , because wild embedded submanifolds admit always infinite triangulations .",
    "* for a special class of compact 4-manifolds we showed in @xcite that exotic smoothness can generate fermions and gauge fields using the so - called knot surgery of fintushel and stern @xcite . in the paper @xcite we presented an approach using the exotic @xmath0 where the matter can be generated ( like in qft ) .",
    "* the path integral in quantum gravity is dominated by the exotic smoothness contribution ( see @xcite or by using string theory @xcite ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in the following three sections we will explain exotic 4-manifolds and motivate the whole approach by using the path integral for the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "here we will also present how to couple the matter and gauge fields to this theory . for a 4-manifold , there are two main invariants the euler and pontrjagin class which determine the main topological invariant of a 4-manifold , the intersection form . in section",
    "[ sec : action - induced - by - top ] , we will obtain the einstein - hilbert and holst action by using these two classes . at the first view , this section is a little bit isolated from the previous and subsequent sections but we will use this result later during the study of the scaling . in the main section [ sec : wild - embeddings ] , we will construct the foliation of an exotic @xmath0 of codimension ( equivalent to a lorentz structure ) . following connes , @xcite the leaf space is an operator algebra constructed from the geometrical information of the foliation ( holonomy groupoid ) .",
    "this operator algebra is a factor @xmath8 von neumann algebra and we will use the tomita - takesaki modular theory to uncover the structure of the foliation .",
    "it is not the first time that this factor was used for quantum gravity and we refer to the paper @xcite for a nice application .",
    "states in this operator algebra are represented by equivalence classes of knotted curves ( element of the kauffman bracket skein module ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the spatial space from the states gives a wild embedded 3-sphere as geometrical representation of the state .",
    "surprisingly , it fits with the properties of the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "if one introduces a global foliation of the exotic @xmath0 by a global time then one obtains a foliation into wild embedded 3-spheres .",
    "in contrast , if one uses a local but complicate foliation then this wild object can be omitted and one obtains a state given by a finite collection of knotted curves .",
    "interestingly , the operator algebra can be understood as observable algebra given by a deformation quantization ( turaev - drinfeld quantization @xcite ) of the classical observable algebra ( poisson algebra of holonomies a la goldman @xcite ) . in section [ sec :",
    "action - at - the - quantum - level ] , we will use the splitting of the operator algebra ( [ eq : crossed - product - factor - iii ] ) given by tomita - takesaki modular theory to introduce the dynamics ( see connes and rovelli @xcite with similar ideas ) .",
    "finally we will obtain a quantum action ( [ eq : quantum - action ] ) in the quantized calculus of connes @xcite .",
    "then the scaling behavior is studied in the next section . for large scales ,",
    "the action can be interpreted as a non - linear sigma model .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) flow analysis @xcite gives the einstein equations for large scales .",
    "the short - scale analysis is much more involved , yielding for small fluctuations the einstein - hilbert action and a non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "in particular , we will obtain a @xmath9dimensional fractal structure . in section",
    "[ sec : some - properties ] we will present some direct consequences of this approach : the nonlinear graviton @xcite , a relation to lattice gauge field theory with a discussion of discreteness and the appearance of dimensional reduction from 4d to 2d . in section [ sec : where - does - fluctuation ] we will discuss the answer to a fundamental question : where does the quantum fluctuations come from ?",
    "the main result of this section can be written as : _ the set of canonical pairs ( as measurable variables in the theory ) forms a fractal subset of the space of all holonomies .",
    "then we can only determine the initial condition up to discrete value ( given by the canonical pair ) and the chaotic behavior of the foliation ( i.e. the anosov flow ) makes the limit not predictable .",
    "_ this interesting result is followed by a section where we will discuss the collapse of the wavefunction by the gravitational interaction by calculating the minimal decoherence time",
    ". furthermore we will discuss entanglement and the measurement process . in section [ sec",
    ": some - implications - for.cosmology ] we will list our work in cosmology which uses partly the results of this paper . in the last section [ sec : conclusion - and - open - questions ] , we will discuss some consequences and open questions .",
    "some mathematical prerequisites are presented in three appendices .",
    "this article is dedicated to my only teacher , carl h. brans for 20 years of collaboration and friendship .",
    "he is the founder of this research area .",
    "we had and will have many interesting discussions .",
    "carl always asked the right question and put the finger on many open points . during the 7 years of writing our book",
    ", we had a very fruitful collaboration and i learned so much to complete even this work .",
    "carl , i hope for many discussions with you in the future .",
    "i m very glad to count on your advice .",
    "happy birthday !",
    "why am i going to concentrate on a concept like exotic smoothness ?",
    "einstein used the equivalence principle as a key principle in the development of general relativity .",
    "every gravitational field can be locally eliminated by acceleration .",
    "then , the spacetime is locally modeled as subsets of the flat @xmath0 or the equivalence principle enforces us to use the concept of a manifold for spacetime .",
    "together with the smoothness of the dynamics ( usage of differential equations ) , we obtain a smooth 4-manifold as model for the spacetime in agreement with the current experimental situation .",
    "a manifold consists of charts and transition functions forming an atlas which covers the manifold completely . _",
    "the smooth atlas is called the smoothness structure _ of the manifold .",
    "it was an open problem for a long time whether every topological manifold admits a unique smooth atlas . in 1957 , milnor found the first counterexample : the construction of a 7-sphere with at least 8 different smoothness structures .",
    "later it was shown that all manifolds of dimension larger than 4 admit only a finite number of distinct smoothness structures .",
    "the real breakthrough for 4-manifolds came in the 80 s where one constructed infinitely many different smoothness structures for many compact 4-manifolds ( countably infinite ) and for many non - compact 4-manifolds ( uncountably infinite ) including the @xmath0 . in all dimensions smaller than four",
    ", there is only one smoothness structure ( up to diffeomorphisms ) , the standard structure .",
    "the standard @xmath0 is simply characterized by the unique property to split smoothly like @xmath10 .",
    "all other distinct smoothness structures are called _ exotic smoothness _ structures .",
    "these structures are different , nonequivalent , smooth descriptions of the same topological manifold , a different atlas of charts . in case of the exotic @xmath0 ,",
    "the difference is tremendous : the standard @xmath0 needs one chart ( and every other description can be reduced to it ) whereas every known exotic @xmath0 admits infinitely many charts ( which can not be reduced to a simpler description ) .",
    "so , the spacetime exhibits a much larger complexity by using an exotic smoothness structure , but why is dimension 4 so special ?",
    "there is a good description in @xcite and i will give a short account now .",
    "at first we have to discuss the question : how do i build an atlas for a smooth manifold ?",
    "the answer is given by considering the construction of diffeomorphisms .",
    "every diffeomorphism is locally given by the solution of @xmath11 for a real function @xmath12 over the manifold .",
    "the fixed points of this equation are the critical points of @xmath12 . in case of isolated critical points",
    ", one can reproduce the structure of the manifold ( this is called morse theory ) .",
    "every critical point leads to the attachment of a handle , a submanifold like @xmath13 , i.e. the @xmath14handle ( where @xmath15 is the @xmath14disk ) .",
    "in many cases , the corresponding structure of the manifold , the handle body , can be very complicated but there are rules ( handle sliding ) to simplify them . in all dimensions except dimension 4 .",
    "therefore , two handle bodies can be described by the same 4-manifold topologically but differ in the smooth description .",
    "one of the most surprising aspects of exotic smoothness is the existence of exotic @xmath0 s . in all other dimensions @xcite ,",
    "the euclidean space @xmath16 with @xmath17 admits a unique smoothness structure , up to diffeomorphisms .",
    "beginning with the first examples @xcite , taubes @xcite and freedman / demichelis @xcite constructed countably many large and small exotic @xmath0 s , respectively .",
    "a small exotic @xmath0 embeds smoothly in the 4-sphere whereas a large exotic @xmath0 can not be embedded in that way . for the following we need some simple definitions : the connected sum @xmath18 and the boundary connected sum @xmath19 of manifolds .",
    "let @xmath20 be two @xmath21-manifolds with boundaries @xmath22 .",
    "the _ connected sum _",
    "@xmath23 is the procedure of cutting out a disk @xmath24 from the interior @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the boundaries @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , and gluing them together along the common boundary component @xmath29 .",
    "the boundary @xmath30 is the disjoint sum of the boundaries @xmath22 .",
    "the _ boundary connected sum _",
    "@xmath31 is the procedure of cutting out a disk @xmath32 from the boundary @xmath33 and @xmath34 and gluing them together along @xmath35 of the boundary .",
    "then the boundary of this sum @xmath31 is the connected sum @xmath36 of the boundaries @xmath22 .",
    "large exotic @xmath0 can be constructed using the failure to arbitrarily split a compact , simply - connected 4-manifold . for every topological 4-manifold one",
    "knows how to split this manifold _ topologically _ into simpler pieces using the work of freedman @xcite .",
    "donaldson @xcite , however , that some of these 4-manifolds do not exist as smooth 4-manifolds .",
    "this contradiction between the continuous and the smooth case produces the first examples of exotic @xmath0 .",
    "below we discuss one of these examples .",
    "one starts with a compact , simply - connected 4-manifold @xmath37 classified by the intersection form @xcite @xmath38 a quadratic form over the second integer homology group . in the first construction of a large exotic @xmath0 ,",
    "one starts with the k3 surface as 4-manifold having the intersection form @xmath39 with the the matrix @xmath40 : @xmath41.\\ ] ] the work of donaldson @xcite shows that a closed , * smooth * , simply - connected , compact 4-manifold @xmath42 with intersection form @xmath43 does not exist .",
    "freedman @xcite showed , however , that there is a topological splitting @xmath44 with the @xmath45times connected sum @xmath46 ( see above ) which fails to be smooth .",
    "this splitting means that we glue together the two manifolds @xmath47 and @xmath48 along the common boundary @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the 4-disk or 4-ball ) .",
    "now we define the interior @xmath51 .",
    "the splitting ( [ eq : splitting - k3 ] ) gives a way to represent the @xmath52 part of the intersection form ( [ eq : intersection - k3 ] ) by using @xmath37 but that fails smoothly .",
    "so , choosing a topological splitting @xmath53\\right)\\cup\\left(\\#_{3}(s^{2}\\times s^{2})\\setminus d^{4}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gives a @xmath54 $ ] inside the @xmath55 .",
    "the interior of @xmath54 $ ] defines a manifold @xmath56 glued to a ( topological ) 4-disk @xmath57 along the common boundary , i.e. @xmath58 topologically .",
    "@xmath59 is homeomorphic to @xmath0 but the non - existence of the smooth splitting implies that it is an exotic @xmath0 and there is no smooth embedded @xmath60 ( otherwise the topological splitting is smooth ) .",
    "this failure for a smooth embedding implies also that such exotic @xmath0 s do not embed in the 4-sphere , i.e. it is a large exotic @xmath0 .",
    "the details of the construction can be found in our book @xcite ( section 8.4 ) .",
    "gompf @xcite introduced an important tool for finding new exotic @xmath61 from others , the end - sum @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be two topological @xmath61 s .",
    "the end - sum @xmath64 is defined as follows : let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be smooth properly embedded rays with tubular neighborhoods @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . for convenience , identify the two semi - infinite intervals with @xmath69 and @xmath70 $ ] leading to diffeomorphisms , @xmath71 and @xmath72\\times\\mathbb{r}^{3}$ ] .",
    "then define @xmath73 as the end sum of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . with a little checking ,",
    "it is easy to see that this construction leads to @xmath64 as another topological @xmath76 however , if @xmath63 are themselves exotic , then so will @xmath64 and in fact , it will be a `` new '' exotic manifold , since it will not be diffeomorphic to either @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "gompf used this technique to construct a class of exotic @xmath61 s none of which can be embedded smoothly in the standard @xmath61 .    by an extension of donaldson theory for a special class of open 4-manifolds , so - called end - periodic 4-manifolds ,",
    "taubes @xcite gives a continuous family of exotic @xmath0 which was extended by gompf to a continuous 2-parameter family @xmath77 .",
    "small exotic @xmath0 s are again the result of anomalous smoothness in 4-dimensional topology but of a different kind than for large exotic @xmath0 s . in 4-manifold topology @xcite , a homotopy - equivalence between two compact , closed , simply - connected 4-manifolds implies a homeomorphism between them ( a so - called h cobordism ) , but donaldson @xcite provided the first smooth counterexample , i.e. both manifolds are generally not diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "the failure can be localized in some contractible submanifold ( akbulut cork ) so that an open neighborhood of this submanifold is a small exotic @xmath0 .",
    "the whole procedure implies that this exotic @xmath0 can be embedded in the 4-sphere @xmath78 .",
    "below we discuss the details for one of these examples .    in 1975",
    "casson ( lecture 3 in @xcite ) described a smooth 5-dimensional h - cobordism between compact 4-manifolds and showed that they `` differ '' by two proper homotopy @xmath61 s ( see below ) .",
    "freedman knew , as an application of his proper h - cobordism theorem , that the proper homotopy @xmath61 s were @xmath61 .",
    "after hearing about donaldson s work in march 1983 , freedman realized that there should be exotic @xmath61 s and , to find one , he produced the second part of the construction below involving the smooth embedding of the proper homotopy @xmath61 s in @xmath78 .",
    "unfortunately , it was necessary to have a compact counterexample to the smooth h - cobordism conjecture , and donaldson did not provide this until 1985 @xcite .",
    "the idea of the construction is simply given by the fact that every such smooth h - cobordism between non - diffeomorphic 4-manifolds can be written as a product cobordism except for a compact contractible sub - h - cobordism @xmath79 , the akbulut cork .",
    "an open subset @xmath80 homeomorphic to @xmath81\\times{{\\mathbb{r}}^{4}}$ ] is the corresponding sub - h - cobordism between two exotic @xmath61 s .",
    "these exotic @xmath61 s are called ribbon @xmath61 s .",
    "they have the important property of being diffeomorphic to open subsets of the standard @xmath61 . that stands in contrast to the previous defined examples of kirby , gompf and taubes .    to be more precise ,",
    "consider a pair @xmath82 of homeomorphic , smooth , closed , simply - connected 4-manifolds .",
    "the transformation from @xmath83 to @xmath84 visualized by a h - cobordism can be described by the following construction .",
    "+ _ let @xmath59 be a smooth h - cobordism between closed , simply connected 4-manifolds @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then there is an open subset @xmath85 homeomorphic to @xmath81\\times{{\\mathbb{r}}^{4}}$ ] with a compact subset @xmath86 such that the pair @xmath87 is diffeomorphic to a product @xmath81\\times(x_{-}\\setminus k ,",
    "u\\cap x_{-}\\setminus k)$ ] .",
    "the subsets @xmath88 ( homeomorphic to @xmath61 ) are diffeomorphic to open subsets of @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath83 and @xmath84 are not diffeomorphic , then there is no smooth 4-ball in @xmath89 containing the compact set @xmath90 , so both @xmath89 are exotic @xmath61 s . _",
    "+ thus , remove a certain contractible , smooth , compact 4-manifold @xmath91 ( called an akbulut cork ) from @xmath83 , and re - glue it by an involution of @xmath92 , i.e. a diffeomorphism @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "this argument was modified above so that it works for a contractible _ open _ subset @xmath97 with similar properties , such that @xmath98 will be an exotic @xmath61 if @xmath84 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore @xmath98 lies in a compact set , i.e. a 4-sphere or @xmath98 is a small exotic @xmath0 . in the next subsection",
    "we will see how this results in the construction of handle bodies of exotic @xmath61 . in @xcite freedman and demichelis",
    "constructed also a continuous family of small exotic @xmath0 .",
    "one of the characterizing properties of an exotic @xmath0 ( all known examples ) is the existence of a compact subset @xmath99 which can not be surrounded by any smoothly embedded 3-sphere ( and homology 3-sphere bounding a contractible , smooth 4-manifold ) .",
    "let @xmath100 be the standard @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath101 smoothly ) and let @xmath1 be a small exotic @xmath0 with compact subset @xmath99 which can not be surrounded by a smoothly embedded 3-sphere .",
    "then every completion @xmath102 of an open neighborhood @xmath103 is not bounded by a 3-sphere @xmath104 . however , @xmath1 is a small exotic @xmath0 and there is a smooth embedding @xmath105 in the standard @xmath0 .",
    "then the completion of the image @xmath106 has the boundary @xmath107 as subset of @xmath100 .",
    "so , we have the strange situation that an open subset of the standard @xmath100 represents a small exotic @xmath1 . in case of the large exotic @xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is much more complicated .",
    "a large exotic @xmath0 does not embed in any smooth 4-manifold which is simpler than the manifold used for the construction of this exotic @xmath0 .",
    "above we considered the example of a large exotic @xmath0 constructed from a k3 surface .",
    "therefore this large exotic @xmath0 embeds in the k3 surface but not in simpler 4-manifolds like @xmath108 .      as of now , we only know of exotic @xmath0 s represented by an infinite number of",
    "coordinate patches .",
    "this naturally makes it difficult to provide an explicit description of a metric .",
    "however , in @xcite , a suggestion to overcome this limitation is provided by the consideration of periodic explicitly described coordinate patches making use of more complex pieces , so - called handles , and even more complex gluing maps .",
    "then one also gets infinite structures of handles but with a clear picture : the coordinate patches have a periodic structure .",
    "* handles * every 4-manifold can be decomposed using standard pieces such as @xmath109 , the so - called @xmath110-handle attached along @xmath111 to the @xmath112handle @xmath113 . in the following we need two possible cases : the 1-handle @xmath114 and the 2-handle @xmath115 .",
    "these handles are attached along their boundary components @xmath116 or @xmath117 to the boundary @xmath60 of the @xmath112handle @xmath50 ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the attachment of a 2-handle is defined by a map @xmath118 , the embedding of a circle @xmath119 into the 3-sphere @xmath60 , i.e. a knot . this knot into @xmath60",
    "can be thickened ( to get a knotted solid torus ) .",
    "the important fact for our purposes is the freedom to twist this knotted solid torus ( so - called dehn twist ) .",
    "the ( integer ) number of these twists ( with respect to the orientation ) is called the framing number or the framing .",
    "thus the gluing of the 2-handle on @xmath50 can be represented by a knot or link together with an integer framing .",
    "the simplest example is the unknot with framing @xmath120 representing the complex projective space @xmath108 or with reversed orientation @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "the 1-handle will be glued by the map of @xmath122 represented by two disjoint solid 2-spheres @xmath123 .",
    "akbulut @xcite introduced another description .",
    "he observed that a 1-handle is something like a cut - out 2-handle with a fixed framing .",
    "we remark that all details can be found in @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the handle body decomposition of an exotic @xmath0 by bizaca and gompf @xcite .",
    "* handle decomposition of small exotic @xmath0 * first it is very important to notice that the exotic @xmath0 is the * interior * of the handle body described below ( since the handle body has a non - null boundary and is compact ) .",
    "the construction of the handle body can be divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is a submanifold consisting of a pair of a 1- and a 2-handle .",
    "this pair can be canceled topologically by using a casson handle and we obtain the topological 4-disk @xmath50 with @xmath0 as interior . this submanifold is a smooth 4-manifold with a boundary that can be covered by a finite number of charts .",
    "the smoothness structure of the exotic @xmath0 , however , depends mainly on the infinite casson handle .",
    "* casson handle * now consider the casson handle and its construction in more detail .",
    "briefly , a casson handle @xmath124 is the result of attempts to embed a disk @xmath125 into a 4-manifold . in most cases this attempt fails and",
    "casson @xcite looked for a substitute , which is now called a casson handle .",
    "freedman @xcite showed that every casson handle @xmath124 is homeomorphic to the open 2-handle @xmath126 but in nearly all cases it is not diffeomorphic to the standard handle @xcite .",
    "the casson handle is built by iteration , starting from an immersed disk in some 4-manifold @xmath127 , i.e. an injective smooth map @xmath128 every immersion @xmath129 is an embedding except on a countable set of points , the double points .",
    "one can kill one double point by immersing another disk into that point .",
    "these disks form the first stage of the casson handle . by iteration",
    "one can produce the other stages . finally consider not the immersed disk but rather a tubular neighborhood @xmath115 of the immersed disk including each stage .",

    "furthermore the path integral of the boundary can be carried out by an integration along @xmath199 ( see @xcite).with some effort @xcite , one can extend this boundary term to a tubular neighborhood @xmath204 $ ] of the boundary @xmath198 . however , the relation ( [ eq : boundary - term - dirac ] ) is only true for simple ( i.e. irreducible ) 3-manifolds , i.e. for complements of a knot admitting hyperbolic structure . for more complex 3-manifolds , we have the following simple scheme : the knot complements",

    "more importantly , the three possible types of torus bundles fit very good into the current scheme of three gauge field interactions ( see @xcite ( section 8) ) .",
    "now we have the following picture : fermions as hyperbolic knot complements and gauge bosons as torus bundles .",
    "both components together are forming an irreducible 3-manifold which is connecting to the remaining space by a @xmath206boundary ( see the prime decomposition in appendix b ) .",

    "the idea of the following construction can be simply expressed : the 2-sphere @xmath212 explores locally the curvature of the space where the curvature is given by the inverse volume @xmath213 of the 2-sphere @xmath212 .",
    "the 2-sphere can be written as a homogenous space @xmath214 also known as hopf bundle .",
    "as mentioned above , the geometry of the bundle @xmath207 $ ] ( interpreted as an equator region of @xmath60 ) is the spherical geometry with isometry group @xmath211 .",
    "so , as a local model we have an embedding of a 3-manifold ( as the spatial component for a fixed time ) into the spacetime with local lorentz symmetry ( represented by @xmath215 ) . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", it is a reductive cartan geometry@xcite over the homogenous space @xmath216 , the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space . for the moment ,",
    "let us extend this symmetry to the spacetime @xmath127 itself .",
    "a cartan connection @xmath149 decomposes as a @xmath217valued connection @xmath218 ( @xmath219 denotes the lie algebra of @xmath211 ) and a coframe field @xmath150 ( with values in @xmath220 ) as @xmath221 by using the scale @xmath222(in agreement with the physical units ) and with curvature @xmath223 then for the spacetime ( as 4-manifold ) , we interpret the cartan connection @xmath149 as the connection of the frame bundle ( with respect to the lorentz structure ) .",
    "now we have to think about what characterizes the @xmath206bundle in a 4-manifold , i.e. a surface bundle over a surface ( at least locally ) .",
    "it is known that a surface bundle over a surface is topologically described by the euler class as well as the pontrjagin class ( via the hirzebruch signature theorem ) .",
    "therefore we choose the sum of the euler and pontrjagin class for the frame bundle as action @xmath224 where the pontrjagin class is weighted by a parameter @xmath225 . using the rules above",
    ", we obtain @xmath226 the einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant and the holst action with immirizo parameter as well the euler and pontrjagin class for the reduced bundles . in this model ,",
    "the curvature is changed locally by adding a @xmath206bundle .",
    "then the scale @xmath227 has to agree with the volume of the @xmath212 . in the action we have the coupling constant @xmath228 which has to agree with @xmath229 ( @xmath230 planck length ) to get in contact with einsteins theory , i.e. we must set @xmath231 the agreement with the einstein - hilbert action showed that this approach can describe gravity but it does not describe the global geometry .",
    "later we can show , however , that it must be the de sitter space @xmath232 globally .",
    "in this section we will support our main hypothesis that an exotic @xmath0 has automatically a quantum geometry , but as noted in the introduction , we must implicitly assume that the quantum - geometrical state is realized in the exotic @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , it follows from the physically motivated existence of a lorentz metric which is induced by a codimension - one foliation .",
    "therefore we will construct the foliation and the corresponding leaf space as the space of observables ( using ideas of connes ) .",
    "this leaf space is a non - commutative @xmath233algebra with observable algebra a factor @xmath3 von neumann algebra .",

    "it is known from mathematics that this algebra ( forming a so - called character variety @xcite ) determines the geometrical structure of the 3-manifold ( along the way of thurston @xcite ) .",
    "the main structure in this approach is the fundamental group , i.e. the group of closed , non - contractible curves in a manifold .",
    "the quantization of this group ( as an expression of the classical geometry ) gives the so - called skein algebra of knots in this manifold .",

    "we will discuss the relation to lattice gauge field theory .",
    "main source for this discussion is the work of bullock , frohman and kania - bartoszyska @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors realize that gauge fields come from the restricted dual of the hopf algebra on which the theory is based .",
    "this leads to a coordinate free formulation .",

    "their new foundations allow them to compute wilson loops and many other operators using a simple extension of tangle functors .",
    "then they analyzed the structure of the algebra of observables . in their viewpoint , the observables correspond to quantum groups seen as rings of invariants of n - tuples of matrices under conjugation .",
    "the connection with lattice gauge field theory is that each n - tuple of matrices corresponds to a connection on a lattice with one vertex and n - edges , with the gauge fields based on a classical group .",
    "the construction given in this paper leads to an algebra of  characters  of a surface group with respect to any ribbon hopf algebra .",
    "the algebras are interesting from many points of view : they generalize objects studied in invariant theory ; they should provide tools for investigating the structure of the mapping class groups of surfaces ; and they should give a way of understanding quantum invariants of @xmath618-manifolds .",
    "the algebra of observables based on the enveloped lie algebra @xmath619 is proved to be the ring of @xmath268-characters of the fundamental group of the associated surface .",
    "then , given the ring of @xmath268-characters of a surface group , they showed that the observables based on the corresponding drinfeld - jimbo algebra form a quantization with respect to the usual poisson structure .",
    "furthermore they proved for the classical groups that the algebra of observables is generated by wilson loops . finally , invoking a quantized cayley - hamilton identity",
    ", they obtain a new proof , that the @xmath620-characters of a surface are exactly the kauffman bracket skein module of a cylinder over that surface .",
    "the power of lattice gauge field theory is that it places the representation theory of the underlying manifold and the quantum invariants in the same setting .",
    "ultimately the asymptotic analysis of the quantum invariants of a @xmath618-manifold in terms of the representations of its fundamental group should flow out of this setting .",
    "the identification of the representation theory of a quantum group with that of a compact lie group leads to rigorous integral formulas for quantum invariants of @xmath618-manifolds .",
    "this should in turn lead to a simple explication of the relationship between quantum invariants and more classical invariants of @xmath618-manifolds .",
    "this relation to lattice gauge field theory seems to imply an underlying discrete structure of the space and/or spacetime , but the approach in the paper uncovers the reason @xcite : the kauffman bracket skein module is discrete structure containing only a finite amount of information .",
    "therefore , any description has to be discrete as well including the approach via gauge fields .",
    "this idea can be extended to the 4-manifold .",
    "as explained above , every smooth 4-manifold can be effectively described by handles and one only needs a finite number to describe every compact 4-manifold .",
    "then the handles can be simply triangulated by using simplices to end up with a piecewise - linear ( or pl ) structure",
    ". the surprising result of cerf for manifolds of dimension smaller than 7 was simple : pl - structure ( or triangulations ) and smoothness structure are the same .",
    "this implies that every pl - structure can be smoothed to a smoothness structure and vice versa .",
    "therefore _ the discrete approach ( via triangulations ) and the smooth approach to defining a manifold are the same _ !",
    "so , our spacetime admits a kind of duality : it contains discrete information in its handle structure but it is a continuous space at the same time . both approaches are interchangeable .",
    "therefore the underlying structure of the spacetime is discrete but the spacetime itself is a smooth 4-manifold . or , the information contained in a smooth 4-manifold is finite .      in @xcite we describe an exotic black hole by constructing a smooth metric for the interior .",

    "in a purely geometrical theory , one has to answer this question . it can not be shifted to assume the appearance of quantum fluctuations .",
    "instead we have to understand the root of these quantum fluctuations .",
    "starting point of our approach is the foliation of the exotic @xmath1 by using the anosov flow .",
    "main point in the argumentation above is the appearance of the hyperbolic geometry in 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds .",
    "the foliation can , however , be interpreted differently : a foliation defines a dynamics at a manifold leading to a splitting into leafs ( the integral curves of the dynamics ) .",

    "this chaotic behavior is a natural consequence of the exotic smoothness structure ( leading to the non - trivial @xmath241foliation ) . for completeness we will describe this dynamics , called the anosov flow . for that purpose",

    "this property is crucial for the following discussion . because of the expanding behavior of one subbundle , the anosov flow is the generator of a chaotic dynamics .",
    "therefore , two geodesics diverge exponentially in this foliation , but this behavior goes over to the holonomies characterizing the geometry .",
    "the transport of a holonomy along two diverging geodesics can lead to totally different holonomies .",
    "currently this dynamics is deterministic , i.e. if we choose exactly the same initial condition then we will end at the state ( seen as limit point ) .",
    "this situation changes if we are unable to choose the initial condition exactly ( by choosing real numbers ) but instead we can only choose a rational number where this rational number is the characterizing property of the state",

    "there is , however , a large difference between the classical random field and a quantum field : there are pairs of not equally accurate measurable observables ( mostly the canonical pairs ) for quantum fields impossible for the classical random fields . with our approach , we showed the same behavior for the canonical pairs .",
    "our geometrical approach should also lead to a description of the measurement process ( including the collapse of the wave function ) . in section",
    "[ sec : wild - embeddings ] , we constructed the geometrical expression for a quantum state given by a wild embedding ( the wild @xmath60 ) .",
    "the reduction of the quantum state ( as linear combination ) to an eigenstate ( or the collapse of the wave function ) is equivalent to a reduction of the wild embedding to a tame embedding .",
    "therefore we need a mechanism to reduce the wild embedding to a tame one .",
    "the construction of the wild @xmath60 is strongly related to the casson handle .",
    "the exoticness of the smooth structure of @xmath1 and the wildness of the @xmath60 depend both on the self - intersection of some disk .",

    "how many levels of the casson handle are needed to cancel the self - intersection ?",
    "this question was answered by freedman @xcite : one needs three levels ( a three - level casson tower ) ! at the same time , however , one produces more self - intersections in the higher levels . therefore one needs a little bit more : a casson tower where a complete casson handle can be embedded .",
    "then this casson handle is able to cancel the self - intersection and we will obtain a tame embedding or a classical state . as shown by freedman @xcite and gompf / singh @xcite , one needs a 5-stage casson tower so that a casson handle with the same attaching circle can be embedded into this 5-stage tower .",
    "we obtain a process which is  the collapse of the wave function  . what is the cause of this collapse ? as explained above , we can not choose a single disk to remove the self - intersections . instead we have to choose a casson tower where each stage is a boundary - connected sum of @xmath701 , i.e. its boundary is the sum @xmath702 where the number of components is equal to the number of self - intersections .",

    "it is given by five complements of the whitehead link @xmath705 closed by two solid tori , i.e. @xmath706 and this manifold can be very complicated for more complex towers .",

    "as shown by witten @xcite , the action @xmath707 for every 3-manifold ( in particular for @xmath708 and @xmath709 denoted by @xmath710 ) is related to the chern - simons action @xmath711 .",

    "mostow rigidity enforces us to choose @xmath722 in the length scale @xmath262 of the hyperbolic structure . in the following",
    "we will switch to quadratic expressions because we will determine the expectation value of the area .",

    "we needed this structure for the construction of the foliation which is given by a polygon in @xmath343 .",
    "this polygon defines a compact surface of genus @xmath723 .",

    "admits a hyperbolic geometry . therefore the tree corresponding to the casson handle must be interpreted as a metric tree with hyperbolic structure in @xmath343 and metric @xmath726",
