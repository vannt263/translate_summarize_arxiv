    "glasses at temperatures below @xmath3k are known to exhibit a number of universal properties almost independent of their composition and fundamentally different from the properties of similar crystals .",
    "these properties are traditionally described within the model of two - level systems ( tls s ) @xcite .",
    "one of these properties is a two - pulse electric dipole echo in glasses , which is the delayed response to two high - frequency electromagnetic pulses .",
    "when a glass is subjected to two rf pulses with a frequency of about @xmath3ghz separated by a time interval @xmath4 much longer than the pulse length , one can observe a response in the glass polarization at time @xmath4 after the second pulse .",
    "especially interesting is the pronounced nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence of the two - pulse echo amplitude observed at temperatures of @xmath0mk in the absence of paramagnetic centers in the glass @xcite .",
    "the nature of this interesting phenomenon remained unclear until works @xcite , where this dependence was associated with the presence of atoms with a nuclear quadrupole moment in the glass .",
    "owing to the interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the external magnetic field ( zeeman interaction ) and the nuclear quadrupole moment with the gradient of the internal electric field , the levels of the tls split into two nearly identical series of levels .",
    "the characteristic energies of such a fine structure are @xmath5erg ( corresponding to a frequency of about @xmath6khz ) , which are much lower than the typical energy of @xmath7mk of the tls s specified by the @xmath3ghz frequency of the excitation pulses .",
    "since the internal field gradient is different at different positions of the tls s , the fine level structure depends on the tunneling state of the tls , which ultimately leads to the nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude @xcite .    as a proof of this hypothesis , the results on measuring the two - pulse echo amplitude in glycerol ( @xmath8 ) were presented @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the echo amplitude dependence on magnetic field increased by more than an order of magnitude under the replacement of hydrogen with zero nuclear quadrupole moment by deuterium ( whose nuclear spin is 1 so deuterium has a small quadrupole moment ) .",
    "the oscillations of the echo amplitude in a magnetic field were theoretically studied in @xcite . in particular , the qualitative explanation of the observed effect was given in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "numerical calculations of the dipole echo amplitude in glycerol in the magnetic field were performed and a good agreement with the experimental data was obtained .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we qualitatively and , in some cases , quantitatively compared our analytic expressions for the echo amplitude in glasses containing nuclear electric quadrupole moments with the experimental data .",
    "however , the existence of small oscillations of the dipole echo amplitude in glasses containing only spherical nuclei ( without quadrupole moments ) , like in nondeuterated glycerol @xmath8 , remained unexplained until papers @xcite .",
    "the presence of a small ( @xmath9 ) natural impurity of the @xmath10 isotope , which also has a nuclear quadrupole moment , did not explain these oscillations .",
    "fleishmann @xcite suggested that the magnetic field dependence of the echo amplitude in the case of non - deuterated @xmath11 may be caused by the dipole - dipole interaction of the nuclear magnetic moments of hydrogen atoms ( the spin and , respectively , the magnetic moment of the primary isotopes of carbon @xmath12c and oxygen @xmath13o are zero ) . this interaction ( along with the zeeman interaction )",
    "induces a fine structure of the levels of the tls , which depends on the tunneling states of the systems .",
    "bazrafshan et al .",
    "@xcite numerically calculated the echo amplitude in deuterated glycerol @xmath14 ( taking into account all of the spins of hydrogen and the quadrupole moments of deuterium ) .",
    "it was assumed that the tunneling of the two - level system is the rotation of the glycerol molecule as a whole .",
    "although the theory was in a good agreement with the experiment in high fields and in semiquantitative agreement in low magnetic fields ( when the dipole - dipole interaction is responsible for the effect ) , the assumption of the rotational character of tunneling was not justified .",
    "this work is aimed at obtaining the analytical results for the magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude in the absence of nonspherical nuclei in the glass , so that only the dipole - dipole interaction of the nuclear spins is taken into account , and at comparing the results with the experimental data on non - deuterated glycerol .",
    "parshin @xcite derived a general formula specifying the dipole echo amplitude in an arbitrary system , which consists of two identical sets of levels separated by an energy gap much larger than the splitting within the sets @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the dipole echo amplitude ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the amplitudes of the first and second exciting electric pulses , respectively ; @xmath19 are the fine - structure energy levels of the tls , @xmath20 is the total number of this levels , and @xmath21 is the matrix element for the transition between the n - th lower and m - th higher levels of the split tls during the action of the excitation pulses .    to use this formula",
    ", we have to find the fine - structure energy levels and the matrix elements of the transition in an arbitrary magnetic field . for that ,",
    "let us write the hamiltonian of the system including , first , the tunneling of the tls atoms and , second , the energies of the nuclear spins , which form the fine level structure : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the hamiltonian of the tls in the coordinate representation ( excluding the fine structure ) ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the identity matrices in the spaces of the tls ( @xmath26 ) and the nuclear spin projections , respectively ; @xmath27 is the pauli matrix for the two - level system ; @xmath28 is the operator of the electric dipole moment @xmath29 of the tls ; and @xmath30 is the external ( excitation ) electric field .    the spin operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the symmetric and antisymmetric ( with respect to the tls displacement ) parts of the spin hamiltonian @xmath33.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the operator of the magnetic moment of the i - th nuclei , @xmath35 is the operator of its spin , and @xmath36 is the external magnetic field .",

    "the summation is performed over all tunneling nuclei .",
    "consequently , @xmath40    note that the first term of spin hamiltonian ( [ hj ] ) , which is associated with the external magnetic field ( the zeeman part ) , does not include vectors @xmath41 that change under tunneling of the tls and , therefore , does not contribute to the antisymmetric @xmath32 part of the hamiltonian . the dipole - dipole interaction ( the second term of hamiltonian ( [ hj ] ) ) enters both operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    to find the quantities associated with the fine level structure ,",

    "the tilded operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the choice of the eigenfunctions of @xmath31 as the basis . in this basis , @xmath46 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "we assume that the characteristic tunneling lengths of the nuclei are much shorter than the characteristic interatomic distances and , consequently , @xmath47 is much smaller than @xmath46 and may be taken into account perturbatively . retaining only the terms proportional to @xmath48 in the transition matrix elements , we obtain the dipole echo amplitude",

    ", we have to diagonalize the matrix @xmath31 , which can not be done analytically even in the simplest case of two interacting spins @xmath52 ( a @xmath53 matrix ) .",
    "thus , to go further , we need to perform some simplifications .",
    "the nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude in @xmath8 was experimentally observed in the magnetic fields @xmath54 g , which corresponds to the zeeman energy @xmath55erg .",
    "the energy of the dipole - dipole interaction between two hydrogen nuclei at a distance of @xmath56  ( the minimum distance between hydrogen atoms in glycerol ) may be estimated as @xmath57erg , which is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the zeeman energy .",
    "in the @xmath58 approximation , we neglect the dipole - dipole interaction in the expression for @xmath31 .",
    "however , this interaction should be retained in @xmath32 , which does not contain terms of the order of @xmath1 .    in this approximation ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath31 are the states with definite projections of all nuclear spins on the direction of the magnetic field . in this case , only the matrix elements @xmath59 of the transition with a change of no more then two spin projections are nonzero .",
    "this allows us to reduce the problem of an arbitrary number of dipole - dipole interacting nuclear spins to the problem of one pair of spins .",
    "we consider only the pairs of identical spin @xmath52 nuclei . the operator @xmath31 may be then written in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the nuclear magnetic moment and @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "are the spin operators of the interacting nuclei .",

    "( [ gendip ] ) , we need to calculate also the average squares of the matrix elements @xmath68 .",

    "( [ ed12 ] ) and average its absolute value square over the directions of the vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( it is easy to see that the averaging affects only the tensor @xmath84 ) . for this purpose , we introduce a new numeration of the elements of @xmath47 : @xmath85 . here , the subscripts @xmath86 and @xmath87 numerate the states of the first and second spins , respectively .",

    "@xmath94 is the same for the second spin .",
    "the isotropy of the glass allows us to express the symmetric tensor @xmath96 in terms of two constants , @xmath97 .",
    "however , it can be shown by direct calculation that the quantity @xmath98 , includes only the diagonal elements and the elements corresponding to the transition between the degenerate second and third levels of @xmath31 .",
    "neither of them contributes to the echo amplitude and , consequently , all significant matrix elements of @xmath47 may be expressed in terms of a single constant @xmath99 .",
    "note that expression ( [ pertecho ] ) was derived without any assumptions about the relation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 and , consequently , is absolutely independent of the tunneling geometry of the atoms , that is , of the microscopic structure of the tls .",
    "let us compare eq .",
    "( [ pertecho ] ) with the measurements @xcite of the magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude in glycerol ( see figure ) .",
    "clearly , the analytical curve with @xmath61 equal to the magnetic moment of a proton describes the experimental data sufficiently well without any fitting parameters ( except for the constant @xmath101 , which specifies the vertical scale ) until the region of small magnetic fields ( @xmath104mt ) , where the conditions @xmath105 seemingly breaks .",
    "the nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude is determined by the term @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ gendip ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the characteristic energies @xmath107 . in the case of @xmath108 ( or , equivalently , @xmath109 )",
    ", we may expect that the condition @xmath58 holds for the dominant part of the dependence .",
    "otherwise , the exact inclusion of the dipole - dipole interaction is required ; in this case , in particular , the problem can not be reduced to the problem of two tunneling nuclei .",
    "this agrees well with the fact that the theory better describes the experimental data for @xmath110 than for @xmath111 ( see figure ) in the low - field region .",
    "note that the horizontal scale of the magnetic field dependence of the echo amplitude in the case under consideration is determined by the time @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the curve @xmath112 should scale in the horizontal axis as @xmath113 with a change in the time interval between the pulses . in the opposite case of @xmath114 , the horizontal scale of the dependence",
    "is determined by the relation @xmath115 and is independent of the time interval between the pulses .",
    "this may be used as an experimental criterion of the smallness of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "to conclude , in the experimentally observed case of @xmath116 , the magnetic field dependence of the dipole echo amplitude induced by the dipole - dipole interaction of the nuclei of the same kind has a universal character independent of the microscopic structure of the tls .",
    "it is well described by a simple analytic expression .",
    "a good agreement of the theory and experiment on the dipole echo in nondeuterated glycerol was obtained without any fitting parameter ( except for the echo amplitude scale ) . at larger values of the time interval between the excitation pulses , @xmath117 , the universal form of the dependence breaks , which may allow one to obtain information on the microscopic structure of the two - level systems with the use of numerical analysis @xcite .",
