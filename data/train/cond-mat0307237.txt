    "the corresponding two moduli @xmath5 and @xmath6 are called bending rigidity and gaussian - curvature modulus , respectively .",
    "the integration @xmath7 extends over the whole membrane surface .",
    "the gaussian - curvature term governs the global structure of the membranes , because the term @xmath8 measures a topological index ; for instance , for a vesicle with @xmath9 handles , such an identity @xmath10 holds ( gauss - bonnet theorem ) .    in spite of its seemingly simple expression ,",
    "it is very hard to treat the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) by analytical methods . as a matter of fact ,",
    "when written in terms of an explicit parameterization , the hamiltonian becomes ugly ; see eqs .",
    "( [ monges_j])-([monges_da ] ) mentioned afterwards .",
    "hence , owing to the thermal undulations and the mutual interactions , it is expected that the effective bending moduli are modified effectively for macroscopic length scales . in order to clarify this issue ,",

    ", the following renormalization - group equation has been obtained ; @xmath11 with renormalized bending rigidity @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13 , and the number of decimated molecules @xmath14 .",
    "literature agrees that the numerical prefactor in the above equation is @xmath15 .",
    "[ a more detailed account of the historical overview would be found in ref . @xcite . ] because of @xmath16 , the effective bending rigidity is reduced by thermally activated undulations .",
    "this conclusion might be convincing , because the membrane shape itself should be disturbed by the thermal undulations . as a matter of fact",
    ", it has been known that the orientational correlation is lost for long distances @xcite .",
    "it is quite natural to anticipate that membranes become flexible for length scales exceeding this correlation length .",
    "recently , however , pinnow and helfrich @xcite obtained a remarkable conclusion @xmath17 .",
    "the key ingredient of their new argument is that they considered the role of measure factors for the partition sum .",
    "they insist that the local mean curvature @xmath1 should be the right statistical measure rather than other measures such as the normal displacement @xmath18 and the local tilt angle @xmath19 .",
    "[ the normal displacement @xmath18 has been used as a standard measure .",
    "we will explain the @xmath18-based parameterization afterwards .",
    "] after an elaborated calculation of the variable replacement @xmath20 and succeeding renormalization - group analysis , the authors reach the conclusion of @xmath21 . moreover , as for the gaussian - curvature modulus , they insist that the effective modulus @xmath22 should remain scale - invariant ; @xmath23 this conclusion again contradicts the common belief that @xmath6 would be enhanced for macroscopic length scales ; namely , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this enhancement signals the topological instabilities .",
    "the developments mentioned above all stem from the approximation that the membrane is almost flat , and the thermally excited undulations are extremely small . in our preceding paper @xcite , we developed an _ ab initio _ simulation scheme in order to study the thermodynamics of a fluid membrane beyond such perturbative level . as a demonstration , we calculated the transformation coefficient @xmath25 , which yields the direction of the renormalization - group flow through coarse - graining .",
    "we found that the renormalization - group flow is influenced significantly by the choice of the statistical measures .",
    "in fact , under the mean - curvature measure , we observed an indication that the effective bending rigidity flows toward the large-@xmath5 direction . we did not include the @xmath6 term in the preceding work .    in this paper , extending the preliminary analysis , we propose an efficient method to observe the effective bending moduli directly : we subject a fluid membrane to a curved reference plane . from the free - energy cost due to the reference - plane deformations , we read off the effective bending moduli .",
    "our data indicate definitely that under the mean - curvature measure , the membrane stiffening occurs even for the case of very flexible membrane @xmath26 .",
    "this result supports the picture that the stiffening , contrary to our naive expectation , is driven by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "we also calculate the effective gaussian - curvature modulus , and show that it remains almost scale - invariant .",
    "again , the result is in good agreement with the pinnow - helfrich claim .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the monte - carlo method has been utilized successfully in the studies of membranes and vesicles @xcite , for the monte - carlo method , however , a tethered ( polymerized ) membrane @xcite rather than a fluid membrane is more suited , because a membrane is implemented in a computer as an assembly of molecules and junctions bearing close resemblance to a tethered membrane .",
    "( note that because of the absence of shear modulus , fluid membranes should have no internal structure . ) however , gompper and kroll succeeded in simulating fluid membranes by the monte - carlo method , allowing reconstructions of junctions during the simulation @xcite .",
    "they observed the topological instabilities with respect to the variation of temperature and membrane concentration . in fairness , it has to be mentioned that their monte - carlo data indicate softening for lipid vesicles .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our new approach to the direct observation of the effective bending moduli . we also explicate the outlines of the numerical method which was reported previously @xcite . in sec .",

    ", we will show that the scenario advocated by pinnow and helfrich holds true even for the non - perturbative regime . in the last section , we give summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we explain the idea for calculating the effective bending moduli . mathematical formulas necessary in the succeeding numerical simulations are derived .",
    "we start with recalling the outlines of the transfer - matrix method proposed previously @xcite .",
    "it is important to recognize the outlines of the transfer - matrix construction , because it elucidates the underlying physical idea of our effective - bending - moduli calculation . in short",
    ", it has to be recognized that our membrane should be classified into the `` open framed membrane '' in the category of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the fluid membranes are free from shear modulus .",
    "this fact tells that the fluid membranes should have no internal structure .",
    "hence , it is by no means fruitful to think of the microscopic constituents realizing the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "hence , we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , an alternative , in a sense , rather simple - minded , approach to the fluid membrane : we constructed the transfer matrix directly from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in the construction",
    ", we managed several discretizations which we explain below .",
    "as noted in introduction , the membrane shape is parameterized by the normal ( transverse ) displacement @xmath27 from a base ( reference ) plane .",
    "the variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the cartesian coordinates on the reference plane . in term of this displacement field @xmath27 , the mean curvature and the gaussian curvature",
    "are parameterized explicitly as follows @xcite ; @xmath30 and , @xmath31 respectively .",
    "similarly , the infinitesimal area @xmath32 is given by , @xmath33 putting them together into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , we arrive at the explicit representation in terms of the displacement field @xmath27 .",
    "now , we are led to a two - dimensional scalar - field theory with considerably complicated interactions .",
    "it is notable that the theory has even no obvious perturbation parameter .",
    "this fact motivated us to develop a first - principle simulation technique .",
    "we put the theory on a square lattice with lattice constant @xmath34 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( a ) .",
    "accordingly , the field variables are now indexed by integer indices ; namely , @xmath35 .",
    "hereafter , we set the lattice constant as the unit of length ; namely , @xmath36 .",
    "our theory has the translational invariance of @xmath37 , and thus , the absolute value of @xmath18 is meaningless . therefore , it is sensible to use the link variable @xmath38 rather than @xmath18 ; note that @xmath39 denotes the step associated at each link ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we are led to the dual lattice model .",
    "thereby , for each shaded plaquette of this dual lattice ( originally a vertex spanned by four adjacent links ) , the following local statistical weight is associated ; @xmath40 with , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are to be replaced @xcite with the finite - difference versions of the differential forms ( [ monges_j])-([monges_da ] ) .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( b ) for the definitions of @xmath45 .",
    "we have set @xmath46 , because this factor can be absorbed into the bending moduli @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we should introduce yet another `` statistical weight '' for each open plaquette so as to impose the constraint of @xmath47 ; the gradient field should be rotationless .",
    "that is , @xmath48    to summarize , we are led to the dual lattice model @xcite with the step variable @xmath39 .",
    "there are two types of statistical weights @xmath49 ( [ statistical_weight1 ] ) and @xmath50 ( [ statistical_weight2 ] ) , which are arranged in the checkerboard pattern .",
    "likewise the transfer matrix is constructed as a strip - like segment shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( c ) .",
    "it is a good position to mention a number of remarks : first , the above theory takes the displacement variable @xmath51 as the statistical measure .",
    "as noted in introduction , the mean - curvature statistical measure is considered to be physically sensible .",
    "the conversion of the statistical measure is achieved by the redefinition of the statistical weight ; namely , @xmath52 the square root is intended to take the geometrical mean , because each step variable @xmath53 is sheared by an adjacent plaquette as well .",
    "second , the step variable is discretized as @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the unit of step @xmath56 is determined self - consistently during the simulation by @xmath57 .",
    "this step - variable discretization is an influential factor concerning the reliability of the present simulation , and its performance was checked previously @xcite .",
    "third , in order to diagonalize the transfer matrix , we utilized the the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the method was invented , originally , so as to investigate the highly - correlated systems such as the hubbard models and the spin chains .",
    "later on , it was extended to the field of soft materials such as the lattice vibrations @xcite , the quantum string @xcite , and the bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "we repeat density - matrix renormalization one after another so as to reach sufficiently long transfer - matrix strip length @xcite .",
    "the number of states retained for a renormalized block is an important technical parameter which is denoted by @xmath58",
    ".    one may wonder that the strong deformations increase the area of the piece of membrane considered to such an extent that the emerging additional degrees of freedom for additional molecules can not be ignored . according to the idea of helfrich , however , the correct statistical measure is the local mean curvature that has noting to do with the `` molecules . ''",
    "therefore , our treatment is justified even for such strong deformations as long as we accept his idea .",
    "strictly speaking , we are not dealing with such `` molecules '' at all ; rather , we had just discretized the real space so as to form a square network , and the vertices are not to be regarded as molecules .",
    "in fact , the fluid membrane should have neither internal structure nor fixed connectivity , and it is not fruitful to think of microscopic constituents , and regard them as the degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , in the above , we have postulated the presence of a reference plane from which all undulations are created , and we imposed no restriction to the total area of the membrane .",
    "hence , in terms of the category of ref .",
    "@xcite , the membrane is to be classified into `` open framed membrane ; '' see ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "the free energy per unit area of the reference plane is the naturally observable quantity .",
    "this leads to the idea that the effective bending moduli would be measured from the increase of the stress energy due to the reference - plane deformations .",
    "we will pursue this idea in the next subsection .      in this subsection , we explain our approach to the effective bending moduli .",
    "there are two types of bending moduli such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; see eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "first , we explain the way to calculate the effective bending rigidity .",
    "we introduce the following hamiltonian with an additional term ; @xmath61 the index @xmath62 runs over the shaded plaquettes of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ; the quantities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are the same as those in eq .",
    "( [ local_hamiltonian ] ) , but possessing the plaquette index @xmath62 now .",
    "note that the additional term is not lumped together with the factor @xmath65 , because our aim is to calculate the stress energy with respect to the reference plane rather than the membrane surface itself .",
    "the additional term breaks the symmetry of the mean curvature @xmath66 linearly .",
    "in other words , the membrane is forced to bend so as to possess a non - vanishing spontaneous mean curvature .",
    "hence , with respect to the stress energy due to the reference - plane deformation , we are able to observe the effective bending rigidity . that is the basic idea of our approach .",
    "such idea was featured in an analytical treatment as well @xcite . by the way ,",
    "our aim is to put forward this idea to an actual computer simulation .    as is well - known ,",
    "the above idea is best formulated by the legendre transformation ; @xmath67 with @xmath68 . here",
    ", @xmath69 denotes the free energy of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_with_source_j ] ) per unit cell ( one shaded plaquette ) .",
    "@xmath70 is the desired legendre - transformed free energy , which is a function of the spontaneous mean curvature @xmath71 .",
    "our concern is to obtain the effective bending rigidity , @xmath72 with use of the well - known identity @xmath73 , we obtain the expression for the effective bending rigidity ; @xmath74 let us address a number of remarks : first , the free energy @xmath75 is readily accessible by the transfer - matrix calculation .",
    "hence , the above formula is suited to our computer simulation .",
    "the remaining task is the numerical differentiation .",
    "we had adopted `` richardson s deferred approach to the limit '' algorithm explicated in the textbook @xcite .",
    "second , we started from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_with_source_j ] ) , which is defined on the reference plane rather than the original fluctuating membrane surface",
    ". therefore , the effective bending rigidity corresponds to the elastic modulus with respect to the reference - plane deformation .",
    "that is precisely what we sought .",
    "the expression of eq .",
    "( [ effective_bending_rigidity_s ] ) may seem to be exceedingly formal .",
    "in fact , it may be unclear how the interaction of the curvature with the undulations is taken into account .",
    "it is noteworthy that the hamiltonian contains the symmetry breaking term @xmath76 and we have to evaluate the free energy in the presence of it . just like the two - dimensional ising model with the external field that has not yet been solved exactly ,",
    "such problem with the symmetry breaking term is far from being trivial in itself , and generally , it contains valuable informations such as the interaction between the background curvature and the thermal undulations .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ effective_bending_rigidity_s ] ) states that the second derivative with respect to @xmath77 yields the effective rigidity .",
    "that is the underlying idea behind the formal expression of eq .",
    "( [ effective_bending_rigidity_s ] ) .",
    "we stress that such an additional term is readily tractable by our simulation method , and owing to this advantage , we are able to access the effective rigidity in a quite straightforward manner",
    ".    we will introduce another effective bending rigidity : through the coarse - graining depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we obtain a coarse - grained lattice and the corresponding smeared curvature @xmath78 @xcite . after rescaling the unit of length @xmath79 and reexpressing the formulas in terms of the rescaled ( smeared ) quantities",
    "[ we put @xmath80 for them ] , we obtain the effective rigidity for the coarse - grained membrane ; @xmath81 note that two unit cells are renormalized into one coarse - grained unit cell .",
    "in other words , two molecules are renormalized into one decimated molecule , and hence , the parameter @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) should be @xmath82 .",
    "let us turn to the gaussian - curvature modulus . in this case",
    ", we incorporate the following additional term coupling to the gaussian curvature linearly ; @xmath83 similar to the above , this leads to the following legendre transformation , @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "our concern is to obtain the effective gaussian - curvature modulus , which , in other worlds , the effective symmetry breaking term with respect to the @xmath3 field .",
    "postulating that the effective free energy @xmath86 is a quadratic polynomial in terms of @xmath87 , we obtain the following expression , @xmath88 again , the similar idea applies to the coarse - grained lattice .",
    "hence , we obtain , @xmath89 we complete preparing the mathematical formulas for the effective bending moduli .",
    "we apply these formulas to the computer simulation in the next section .",
    "in this section , we explore the effective bending moduli [ @xmath59 , eqs .",

    ", we will elucidate the role of statistical measures .",
    "as mentioned in the above section , we have fixed the temperature ( @xmath46 ) , because this factor can be absorbed into the redefinition of the bending moduli .    here",
    ", we shall outline some technical points , that are relevant to the simulation precision .",
    "[ detailed account of the simulation algorithm is presented in ref .",
    "] we repeated forty renormalizations for obtaining each plot ; namely , the strip length of the transfer matrix extends to @xmath90 .",
    "the technical parameters @xmath58 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are indicated in each figure caption ; see sec .",
    "[ section2_1 ] for the meanings of these technical parameters .",
    "these parameter values are equivalent or even improved to those used previously @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reliability of the simulation is maintained .      in this subsection ,",
    "we focus our attention on the effective bending rigidity .",
    "for that purpose , for the time being , we drop the gaussian - curvature term , which is considered in the next subsection ; namely , we set @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , we plotted the effective bending rigidity @xmath59 for various bare rigidity @xmath5 .",
    "the moduli @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the effective bending rigidities for smaller and longer length scales , respectively ; see eqs .",
    "( [ effective_bending_rigidity_s ] ) and ( [ effective_bending_rigidity_l ] ) . here",
    ", we have accepted the local mean curvature @xmath1 as for the statistical measure ; recent through discussion @xcite insists that this statistical measure should be the right one . from the plot",
    ", we see that the rigidities @xmath94 and @xmath95 deviate from each other as for small @xmath5 . in the small-@xmath5 regime ,",
    "the membrane becomes very flexible , and so the thermal fluctuations should be enhanced significantly .",
    "hence , we see that the correction to the effective rigidity is actually induced by the thermal fluctuations",
    ". moreover , we notice @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the membrane acquires stiffness for longer length scales ; namely , the membrane stiffening sets in .",
    "such membrane stiffening was first predicted by the analytical arguments @xcite .",
    "however , for the small-@xmath5 regime , the analytical arguments are not fully justified , because the arguements stem from the `` nearly flat approximation . '' on the other hand , our first - principle simulation does not rely on any perturbative treatment . in that sense ,",
    "our data demonstrate very definitely that the membrane stiffening occurs withstanding the thermal disturbances .",
    "note that the effective rigidity @xmath94 is by no means identical to the `` bare '' coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "the former is the bending elasticity with respect to the reference - plane deformations , whereas the latter is the elastic constant of the membrane surface itself .",
    "therefore , they need not coincide . however , for sufficiently large @xmath5 , as is seen from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the curve tends to be parallel to the slope of the line @xmath97 , indicating that they coincide asymptotically for large @xmath5 .",
    "we shall argue the relationship between the above result and our previous report @xcite . the regime @xmath98 , where we found a notable deviation of @xmath94 and @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , coincides with the area of the prominent @xmath99 enhancement reported in fig .",
    "[ although @xmath99 does not yield direct assessment of the effective rigidity , we concluded that the @xmath99 enhancement should reflect the membrane stiffening . ] hence , in retrospect , our preceding analysis appears to capture the precursor of the membrane stiffening fairly correctly .    in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , at @xmath100 , there appears a singularity : the moduli @xmath94 and @xmath95 approach to each other , and for @xmath101 , they split off again .",
    "this singularity may indicate an onset of a phase transition . for @xmath101 , because of @xmath96 , a membrane stiffening should occur . as a matter of fact , because of the discretization of the step variables [ see sec .",
    "[ section2_1 ] ] , it is likely that the membrane is trapped by the most stable configuration ( flat surface ) for large @xmath5 .",
    "[ it is expected that the membrane becomes flat just like the smooth phase in the solid - on - solid model with large surface tension .",
    "] moreover , it is well known that the correlation length diverges exponentially for large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such long correlation length would exceed the capability of the numerical simulation .",
    "the large-@xmath5 behavior appearing in @xmath102 is thus an artifact of the numerical simulation .",
    "the membrane stiffening for large @xmath5 is not intrinsic , and is rather driven by the mechanism different from that of the small-@xmath5 side .    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( a ) , keeping such drawback in mind , we have drawn an anticipated behavior of the effective bending rigidity for a wide range of @xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above , the analytical treatment is justified for large @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "our first - principle simulation works efficiently in the other side ( non - perturbative regime ) . for sufficiently large @xmath5 ,",
    "the analytical argument predicts the correction to the effective @xmath5 such as @xmath103 .",
    "the correction appears to be exceedingly small to be resolved by the numerical simulation ; see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] as well . on the other hand , for the small-@xmath5 regime ,",
    "our simulation data indicate that the correction to the effective @xmath5 increases very significantly .",
    "the amount of correction is comparable to the thermal - fluctuation energy ; note that we have chosen @xmath104 as the unit of energy ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "hence , it is suggested that for macroscopic length scales , the membrane acquires a considerable amount of effective stiffness , and it would look almost flat irrespective of the thermal disturbances .",
    "let us turn to the normal - displacement statistical measure . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we plotted the effective bending rigidity @xmath59 under this statistical measure .",
    "notably enough , the behavior is quite contrastive with that of the local - curvature measure mentioned above : the larger - scale effective rigidity @xmath95 is suppressed by the thermal undulations .",
    "hence , it is shown that the membrane is softened effectively for macroscopic length scales .",
    "this result may meet our intuition , and has been predicted by numerous analytical arguments based on the normal - displacement measure @xcite .",
    "we stress that our first - principle simulation covers various statistical measures in a unified way .",
    "our simulation clarifies fairly definitely that the choice of measure factors is vital for the thermodynamics of the fluid membrane .",
    "again , for large @xmath105 , a signature of the membrane stiffening @xmath106 comes up , and the membrane should undergo the flat phase .",
    "this behavior is a drawback of our simulation as mentioned above . keeping this in mind ,",

    "it is almost comparable to the analytical prediction ; see fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] as well .",
    "hence , our first - principle simulation indicates that the analytical formula ( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) is more or less applicable even for the case of the non - perturbative regime under the normal - displacement measure .      in the above ,",
    "we have studied the thermal - fluctuation - induced corrections to the bending rigidity @xmath5 . in this subsection",
    ", we incorporate the gaussian - curvature modulus @xmath6 , and look into its effective strength @xmath60 . as noted in introduction , the gaussian - curvature - modulus term is related to the topological index , and hence , it governs the global structure of the membranes . roughly speaking , for @xmath108 , the plumbers - nightmare phase ( lamellar with tunnel - like defects )",
    "is stabilized , whereas for @xmath109 , the formation of vesicles ( droplets ) is favored . in that sense ,",

    "first , let us argue the latter .",
    "[ because this case provides a prototypical example , we will argue it prior to the mean - curvature case . ]",
    "the latter case has been studied extensively so far with analytical approaches @xcite . however , because we are supposing that the membrane is framed by the reference plane , there emerge some characteristic features . for @xmath112",
    ", we see that a large amount of effective @xmath113 appears .",
    "this result indicates that the membrane undulations are dominated by the dimple - like deformations , and possibly , the membrane tends to form droplets .",
    "this feature is in accordant with the previous claim @xcite that for small membrane concentration , the membranes are thermodynamically unstable to the dissolution into the solvents ( sponge phase ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the effective modulus for the longer length scale , namely , @xmath114 , exhibits considerable suppression .",
    "notably enough , it becomes even positive for @xmath115 : for macroscopic length scales , the membrane recovers its stability around @xmath112 , although microscopic undulations are in favor of droplets .",
    "such crossover behavior is convincing , because the membrane is framed by the reference plane , and macroscopically , lamellar - type structure should be retained .",
    "as the bare modulus @xmath6 decreases , the effective moduli of different length scales coincide at @xmath116 . for the region exceeding this point @xmath117 , in turn , @xmath118 dominates @xmath119 eventually .",
    "hence , in this region , the droplet formation is favored for macroscopic length scales .",
    "the location of this transition point is reminiscent of that advocated by the analytical arguments @xcite , which predicts the transition point @xmath120 . in our simulation ,",
    "the planar - type morphology is assumed a priori .",
    "therefore , in such regime @xmath121 , our numerical simulation does not cover such sponge phase .",
    "in fact , it suffers from pathologies such as the diverging mean deviation of the step variables . in the same way , for exceedingly large @xmath122",

    "in the regions depicted in figs . [ figure6 ] and",
    "[ figure7 ] , the planar - type morphology is retained , and thus our simulations are reliable .",
    "second , let us turn to the case of the mean - curvature measure : in fig . [ figure6 ] , we plotted @xmath60 for various bare gaussian - curvature modulus @xmath6 .",
    "there appear some behaviors characteristic of the mean curvature measure : we notice that @xmath119 and @xmath118 almost overlap each other around @xmath123 .",
    "that is , the gaussian - curvature modulus stays almost scale - invariant through coarse - graining .",
    "this result supports the aforementioned analytical prediction @xcite of eq .",

    "surprisingly enough , the enhancement of the effective bending rigidity copes with the thermal - fluctuation energy @xmath125 , suggesting that the membrane would stay almost flat for macroscopic length scales .    on the contrary , under the normal - displacement statistical measure , we found a clear indication of the membrane softening ; see figs .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( b ) and [ figure5 ] .",
    "this fact indicates that the choice of measure factors is indeed significant .",

    "( [ renormalization_group_equation ] ) even for small @xmath5 .    for exceedingly large rigidity",
    ", the membrane fluctuations freeze because of the exponentially diverging correlation length @xcite and the pinning potential due to the step - variable discretization ; the membrane undergoes the flat phase eventually just like the solid - on - solid model with large surface tension .",
    "the appearance of such phase is a drawback of the numerical simulation , and in this respect , the simulation and the analytical treatment are both complementary .",
