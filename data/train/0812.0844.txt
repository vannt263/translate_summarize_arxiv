    "@xcite studied vertically stratified local disks with free boundaries to allow leaks of mass and magnetic field . while their main purpose is to study general properties of stratified disks such as disk coronae rather than disk winds",
    ", they concluded that the mass flux of the outflows is small in the cases of initially toroidal and zero - net vertical flux magnetic fields . on the other hand , protoplanetary disks around young stars",
    "should have net vertical magnetic fields that are connected to their parental molecular clouds . in this case , the physical conditions of the surface of the disk are analogous to the open coronal holes of the sun where the solar wind is driven by turbulent footpoint motions of the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "obviously , mhd turbulence excited by mri in the disk is also expected to drive winds from the surfaces of the accretion disk .",
    "although such a disk wind mechanism may play a significant role in the evolution of accretion disks @xcite , quantitative studies have not been carried out so far because of difficulties in the numerical treatment : a long - term calculation of the wind process requires accurate description of outgoing boundary conditions for various types of waves , rather than simple free boundaries .    in this letter , we investigate disk winds driven by mri with initially vertical magnetic fields utilizing the rigorous outgoing boundary condition that was originally developed for the simulations of solar @xcite and stellar @xcite winds .",
    "we perform 3d mhd simulations in a local shearing box ( hawley et al.1995 ) , taking into account vertical stratification @xcite .",
    "we set the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-coordinates as the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "we solve the ideal mhd equations with an isothermal equation of state in a frame corotating with kepler rotation . in the momentum equation",
    "we consider the vertical gravity by a central star , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is keplerian rotation frequency .",
    "we adopt a second - order godunov - cmocct scheme , in which we solve nonlinear riemann problems with magnetic pressure at cell boundaries for compressive waves and adopt the consistent method of characteristics ( cmoc ) for the evolution of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the simulation region is @xmath5 , and is resolved by ( 32,64,256 ) grid points , where @xmath6 is the pressure scale height for sound speed , @xmath7 .",
    "the shearing boundary is adopted for the @xmath0-direction to consider the keplerian shear flow ( hawley et al .",

    "we prescribe the outflow condition in the @xmath2-directions by adopting only outgoing characteristics from all seven ( six for isothermal gas ) mhd characteristics at the @xmath8 boundaries ( suzuki & inutsuka 2006 ) .",
    "while the @xmath2-component of the magnetic flux is strictly conserved , the @xmath0- and @xmath1- components are not conserved because of the outgoing condition at the @xmath2 boundaries .",
    "we initially set up a hydrostatic density structure , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and a constant vertical magnetic field , @xmath11 , with the plasma @xmath12 value , @xmath13 ( for our fiducial model ) at the midplane .",

    "small random perturbations , @xmath17 , are initially given for the seeds of mri .",
    "in most of the simulation region , the initial magnetic fields are moderately weak , so it is unstable with respect to mri . in @xmath18 , however , we can not initially resolve the wavelengths , @xmath19 , of the most unstable mode because @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is speed and @xmath22 is the mesh size ( the initial @xmath23 at the midplane ) .",
    "first , mri develops around @xmath24 after @xmath25 rotations .",
    "the turbulence driven by mri gradually spreads toward the midplane , since the growth time ( approximately @xmath26 for @xmath27 ) of the resolved wavelength is longer there .",
    "when @xmath28 rotations , the midplane finally becomes turbulent .",
    "the magnetic field strength saturates in the entire box after @xmath29 rotations , and the system becomes quasi - steady - state . at this time",
    ", @xmath30 can be resolved even at the midplane owing to the increase of the field strength .",
    "we continue the simulation further up to 400 rotations .",
    "figure [ fig : snp ] is the snapshot of magnetic field ( white lines ) , velocity field ( arrows ) , and @xmath31 ( color ) at @xmath32 rotations , where @xmath33 is the density averaging over each @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and @xmath34 .",

    "greatly dominate the means .",
    "the magnetic energy , which is dominated by the toroidal ( @xmath1 ) component as a consequence of winding , is amplified by @xmath57 1000 times of the initial value ( @xmath58 ) in most of the region ( @xmath59 ) . while in the region near the midplane ( @xmath60 ) , the magnetic field",
    "is dominated by the fluctuating component ( @xmath61 ) , the mean component dominates in the regions near the surfaces ( @xmath62 ) . in the surface regions the magnetic pressure is comparable to or larger than the gas pressure ( @xmath63 ) , and so , the gas motions can not control the configuration of the magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the field lines tend to be straightened by magnetic tension to give @xmath64 there , even if the gas is turbulent .",

    "an interesting feature of @xmath74 is that the sign changes at @xmath96 ( the circles in the bottom panel ) ; in @xmath97 , the flux is upward ( downward ) and @xmath98 the flux is toward the midplane .",

    "this is because @xmath100 ( the gas pressure dominates ) in @xmath101 and @xmath63 near the surfaces .    in order to study the effects of the initial magnetic fields",

    ", we show the time averages during 25 - 55 rotations because the quasi - steady - state is not achieved but 90 % of the total mass escapes at 75 rotations as a result of the effective mass loss by disk winds .",
    "all the cases of @xmath107 show very similar @xmath104 structures ( figure [ fig : betadep ] ) : @xmath108 at the midplanes , namely the magnetic energy can be amplified to @xmath109% of the gas energy .",
    "the @xmath12 values decrease with increasing height mainly because of the decrease of the densities ( the magnetic energies stay nearly constant ; figure [ fig : tav ] ) .",
    "when the magnetic energy dominates ( @xmath63 ) , the disk winds start to accelerate . in the wind regions ,",
    "the @xmath12 values stay at @xmath110-@xmath111 , rather than further decrease , owing to the increased density by the lift - up gas in the winds .",
    "the locations of the injection regions also concentrate at @xmath112-@xmath113 except for the initial @xmath114 case .",
    "the plasma @xmath12 values of the injection regions are 1 - 10 ; the magnetic energy is comparable to but slightly smaller than the equipartition value .",
    "this condition is favorable for driving mass motions by the breakup of large - scale channel flows ; if the magnetic energy is larger , the field configuration becomes more coherent due to the tension so that reconnections hardly occur ; if the magnetic energy is smaller , the reconnections can not drive strong mass motion .",
    "the mass flux of the disk winds ( figure [ fig : msfxdep ] ) only weakly depends on @xmath105 for @xmath115 , while it increases for smaller @xmath105 almost in proportion with @xmath105 .",
    "we have shown that the gas is lifted up from the injection regions at @xmath116-@xmath113 to the surfaces by the poynting flux and streams out from the upper and lower boundaries of the simulation box . in effect , our results determine the condition of `` mass loading '' in various models of global disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ferreira et al 2006 ) , in which one usually fixes the mass flux in advance by setting the densities at the ` bases ' of winds . with our outgoing boundary condition , we implicitly assume that once the gas goes out of the @xmath2-boundaries of the simulation box it does not return .",
    "the validity of this treatment needs to be examined by the global modeling of accretion disks .",
    "although in the shearing box treatment the time - averaged net mass flow in the @xmath0-direction is zero , we can estimate the accretion velocity , @xmath117 , from the angular momentum balance under steady states , where @xmath118 is a cylindrical distance from a central star @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the mass - loss rate , @xmath119 , from the simulation box by the disk winds to the mass accretion rate , @xmath120 , passing through the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane becomes @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 ; @xmath124 denotes the time - average and @xmath125 is the average of time and @xmath0-@xmath1 planes .",
    "the final value is estimated from @xmath126 and @xmath127 in our fiducial run for a moderately thin disk with @xmath128 .",
    "we should take _ the above estimate as an upper limit _ because the calculation with a larger vertical box size may give a smaller mass flux at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the angular momentum loss rates in vertical and radial directions give the same scaling , @xmath129 because the time - averaged specific angular momentum carried by the winds is approximately the same as that in the disk material at the same radial position in the shearing box treatment . in a realistic situation , however , winds possibly carry a larger specific angular momentum than the disk material . for such studies ,",
    "we need to model global accretion disks with disk winds , which is also important from the viewpoint of angular momentum evolution of the star - disk system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hereafter we discuss the evolution of protoplanetary disks , as an application of our results . as a reference model",
    ", we use the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) of hayashi ( 1981 ) , which gives the midplane density , @xmath130 .",
    "then , the initial vertical magnetic field of @xmath103 in our fiducial run corresponds to @xmath131 g , and the saturated field strength is @xmath132 g at 1 au .",
    "first , we examine how much the disk wind contributes to the evaporation of protoplanetary disks ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for other mechanisms ) .",
    "after the saturation of the magnetic fields , @xmath133% of the total disk mass is lost from the simulation box from 200 to 400 rotations by the disk winds in our fiducial case . assuming a disk around a central star with the solar mass ( 1 rotation = 1 yr at 1 au ) , we have the timescales of the evaporation , @xmath134 yr at 1 au , and @xmath135 yr at 30 au .",
    "although this is rather short in comparison with recent observational results ( typically @xmath136 yrs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is not a severe contradiction because we have not yet taken into account the global radial accretion of the disk mass , which continuously supplies the mass from the outer region .",
    "another important issue that affects , and might reduce , the mass flux of disk winds is the effect of resistivity , which requires an additional detailed analysis of the ionization structure @xcite and will be the scope of our next paper . here",
    ", the estimated @xmath137 should be taken as a lower limit .",
    "the disk scale height has a relation of @xmath138 for the mmsn . combining with equation ( [ eq : msfx ] )",
    ", we infer that the dynamical evaporation by disk winds , in comparison with accretion , becomes relatively more important in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks than in the outer regions for a constant initial @xmath105 structure ( @xmath139 for the mmsn ) .    finally , we should point out the effects of waves on dusts in protoplanetary disks .",
    "we have shown that the momentum flux of alfvnic and sound - like waves directs to the midplane from the injection regions .",
    "the momentum flux of the sound - like waves ( @xmath140 ) can push dust grains to the midplane by gas - dust collisions .",
