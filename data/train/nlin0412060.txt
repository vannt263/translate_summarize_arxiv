    "it is well known that the solutions to an initial value problem for the non - dispersive shallow water equations may lead to wave - breaking after a finite time , when the first spatial derivatives blow up .",
    "after the wave breaking point , a formal solution becomes multi - valued and loses its physical meaning .",
    "the divergence of the spatial derivatives at the wave - breaking point suggests that dispersion effects described by terms with higher order spatial derivatives must be taken into account .",
    "then these small dispersion effects lead to the onset of oscillations in the vicinity of the wave breaking point followed by the development of an undular bore , or in different terminology , a dissipationless shock wave .",
    "this physical picture has been put into mathematical form for waves described by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation by gurevich and pitaevskii ( gp ) in @xcite ( see also whitham in @xcite ) . in the gp formulation , the region of oscillations",
    "is presented as a slowly modulated periodic wave solution of the kdv equation .",
    "the parameters of the wave change little on typical wavelength / period scales which permits one to apply the whitham modulation theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting whitham equations describe the slow evolution of the parameters in the undular bore . in the original paper @xcite ,",
    "two typical problems were considered .",
    "one problem is concerned with the description of decay of an initial discontinuity for the kdv equation and the exact @xmath0-similarity solution of this problem was constructed .",
    "another problem corresponds to the ( universal ) initial stage of development of a bore when the solution of the dispersionless equation can be approximated locally by a properly chosen cubic curve .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite numerically . an exact analytic solution to this problem",
    "was later obtained by potmin @xcite using krichever s algebro - geometrical procedure for integration of the whitham equations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later , potmin s solution was put into the general context of tsarev s generalized hodograph transform @xcite in @xcite , where the hodograph equations were reduced to the classical euler - poisson equation .",
    "however , the kdv equation describes unidirectional propagation of nonlinear dispersive waves .",
    "an integrable bi - directional analog of the kdv equation was derived by kaup in @xcite using the boussinesq approximation for shallow water waves @xcite . like the kdv equation ,",
    "the kaup - boussinesq ( kb ) system is completely integrable and therefore a powerful inverse scattering transform method can be applied to its investigation . in particular , the multi - phase periodic solutions of the kb system were found in @xcite , the whitham theory of modulations was applied in @xcite to the problem of the decay of an initial discontinuity , and a quasiclassical description of soliton trains arising from a large initial pulse was developed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further extend the gurevich - pitaevskii theory to the case of bi - directional shallow water equations using the kb system , and construct an analytic solution to the whitham - kb equations for the regime of generation of an undular bore in the vicinity of a breaking point .",
    "the obtained solution , along with its own significance in the representation of undular bores , will serve as an intermediate asymptotic in a more general formulation we are presently undertaking , in which small dissipation is taken into account .",
    "in dimensionless units ( see , e.g. @xcite ) the kb system can be written in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the height of the water surface above a horizontal bottom and @xmath3 is related to the horizontal velocity field ( at the leading order it is the depth - averaged horizontal field ) .",
