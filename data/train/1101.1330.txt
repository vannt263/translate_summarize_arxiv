    "this paper builds on our previous paper @xcite where we used immersed skew pants in a given hyperbolic 3-manifold to prove the surface subgroup theorem .",
    "we note that lewis bowen @xcite was the first to attempt to build finite covers of riemann surfaces by putting together immersed pairs of pants .",
    "we also note that it follows from the work of danny calegari @xcite that the pants homology is equal to the standard homology .",
    "this means that every sum of closed curves on a closed surface @xmath1 that is zero in the standard homology @xmath34 is the boundary of a sum of immersed pairs of pants in @xmath1 .",
    "we are grateful to lewis bowen for carefully reading the manuscript .      in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we proved a theorem very similar to theorem [ thm - main-1 ] , namely that given a closed 3-manifold @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , we can find a finite cover @xmath17 of @xmath14 and a map @xmath38 that lifts to a map @xmath39 such that @xmath40 has a @xmath7-quasiconformal extension .",
    "we proved that theorem by finding a large collection of  skew pairs of pants \" whose cuffs have complex half - lengths close to @xmath2 , and which are  evenly distributed \" around every closed geodesic that appears as a boundary .",
    "we then assemble these pants by ( taking two copies of each and then ) pairing off the pants that have a given geodesic as boundary , so that the resulting complex twist - bends ( or reduced fenchel - nielsen coordinates ) are close to 1 .",
    "we can then construct a cover @xmath17 of orb(r ) and a function @xmath41 whose image is the closed surface that results from this pairing .",
    "the function @xmath31 will then have the desired property .",
    "we would like to proceed in the same manner in dimension 2 , that is when a 3-manifold @xmath35 is replaced with a closed surface @xmath42 .",
    "we can , as before , find a collection of good immersed pants ( with cuff length close to @xmath2 ) that is  evenly distributed \" around each good geodesic ( of length close to @xmath2 ) that appears as boundary .",
    "if and when we can assemble the pants to form a closed surface with ( real ) twists close to 1 , we will have produced a @xmath7-quasiconformal immersion of a cover of @xmath14 into @xmath42 .",
    "there is only one minor detail : the unit normal bundle of a closed geodesic in @xmath42 has two components .",
    "in other words , an immersed pair of pants that has a closed geodesic @xmath43 as a boundary can lie on one of the two sides of @xmath43 .",
    "if , in our formal sum of pants , we find we have more pants on one side of @xmath43 than the other , then we have no chance to form a closed surface out of this formal sum of pants .",
    "it is for this very reason that the ehrenpreis conjecture is more difficult to prove than the surface subgroup theorem .    because our initial collection is evenly distributed ,",
    "there are almost the same number of good pants on both sides of any good geodesic , so it is natural to try to adjust the number of pairs of pants so that it is balanced ( with the same number of pants on both sides of each geodesic ) .",
    "this leads us to look for a  correction function \" @xmath44 from formal sums of ( normally ) oriented closed geodesics ( representing the imbalance ) to formal sums of good pants , such that the boundary of @xmath45 is @xmath46 .",
    "the existence of this correction function then implies that  good boundary is boundary good \" , that is any sum of good geodesics that is a boundary in @xmath47 ( the first homology group of @xmath42 ) is the boundary of a sum of good pants .",
    "thus we define the good pants homology to be formal sums of good geodesics ( with length close to @xmath2 ) modulo boundaries of formal sums of good pants .",
    "we would like to prove that the good pants homology is the standard homology on good curves .",
    "the natural approach is to show that any good curve is homologous in good pants homology to a formal sum of @xmath48 particular good curves that represent a basis in @xmath47 ( @xmath32 is the genus of @xmath42 ) .",
    "that is , we want to show that there are @xmath49 good curves that generate @xmath47 ( here @xmath47 is taken with rational coefficients ) such that every good curve @xmath43 is homologous in the good pants homology to a formal sum @xmath50 , for some @xmath51 .",
    "then any sum of good curves is likewise homologous to a sum of good generators @xmath52 , but if the original sum of good curves is zero in @xmath47 then the corresponding sum of @xmath52 s is zero as well .    to prove the good correction theorem",
    ", we must first develop the theory of good pants homology .",
    "let @xmath53 denote a base point on @xmath42 . for @xmath54 , we let @xmath55 $ ] denote the closed geodesic freely homotopic to @xmath56 .",
    "our theory begins with the algebraic square lemma , which states that , under certain geometric conditions , @xmath57 = 0,\\ ] ] in the good pants homology .",
    "( the curves @xmath58 $ ] must be good curves , the words @xmath59 reasonably efficient , and the length of @xmath60 and @xmath61 sufficiently large ) .",
    "this then permits us to define , for @xmath62 , @xmath63-[ta^{-1}t^{-1}u ] \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is fairly arbitrary .",
    "then @xmath64 in good pants homology is independent of the choice of @xmath60 .",
    "we then show through a series of lemmas that @xmath65 in good pants homology , and therefore @xmath66 where by @xmath67 we have written @xmath46 as a product of generators ( here @xmath68 are the generators for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . with a little more work we can show @xmath71=\\sum \\sigma(i)(g_{i_{j}})_t\\ ] ] as well , and",
    "thus we can correct any good curve to good generators .",
    "we are then finished except for one last step : we must show that our correction function , which gives an explicit sum of pants with a given boundary , is well - behaved in that it maps sums of curves , with bounded weight on each curve , to sums of pants , with bounded weight on each pair of pants .",
    "we call such a function semirandom , because if we pick a curve at random , the expected consumption of a given pair of pants is not much more than if we picked the pair of pants at random .",
    "we define the correction function implicitly , through a series of lemmas , each of which asserts the existence of a formal sum of pants with given boundary , and which is in principle constructive .",
    "the notion of being semirandom is sufficiently natural to permit us to say that the basic operations , such as the group law , or forming @xmath55 $ ] from @xmath56 , as well as composition and formal addition , are all semirandom .",
    "so in order to verify that our correction function is semirandom , we need only to go through each lemma observing that the function we have defined is built out of the functions that we have previously defined using the standard operations which we have proved are semirandom .    to make the the paper as easy to read as possible ,",
    "we have relegated the verification of semi - randomness to the  randomization remarks \" which follow our homological lemmas , and which use the notation and results ( that basic constructions are semirandom ) that we have placed in the appendix .",
    "we strongly recommend that the reader skip over these randomization remarks in the first reading , and to interpret the word  random \" in the text to simply mean  arbitrary \" .",

    "we observe that @xmath1542 is @xmath1296-semirandom from @xmath433 to @xmath431 .",
    "[ lemma - r-1 ] let @xmath1543 and @xmath1544 .",
    "then for any @xmath1545 such that @xmath1546 , there are at most @xmath1547 ways of writing @xmath1548 , with @xmath1371 $ ] and @xmath1549 $ ] , for some @xmath1539 .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 and @xmath1418 satisfy the given conditions .",
    "consider a triangle in @xmath341 whose sides are lifts of @xmath1133 , @xmath1134 and @xmath1135 ( these lifts are denoted the same as the arcs we are lifting ) .",
    "then we drop the perpendicular @xmath338 from the vertex opposite to @xmath1135 to the side @xmath1135 , and let @xmath1550 and @xmath1551 be the lengths of the subintervals of @xmath1135 that meet at the endpoint of @xmath338 on @xmath1135 ( then @xmath1552 ) . for simplicity , set @xmath1553",

    "so @xmath1556,\\ ] ] and @xmath1557.\\ ] ] therefore , the lift of the lifts of @xmath1133 and @xmath1134 must lie in a disc of radius @xmath1558 around the foot of @xmath338 at @xmath1135 .",
    "it follows that there are at most @xmath1559 lift of the base point in this disc , and we are finished .",
    "we define a partial map @xmath1578 as follows .",
    "given @xmath1579 , we let @xmath1580 $ ] , and @xmath1581 be the projection of the base point @xmath53 to @xmath43 . as always , the projection is defined by choosing lifts of @xmath1323 and @xmath43 in @xmath341 that have the same endpoints and then we project a lift of @xmath53 to the lift of @xmath43 , where the lift of @xmath53 belongs to the lift of @xmath1323 . we let @xmath1582 .",

    "this map is really defined as a map @xmath1592 , and we observe that it is @xmath176-semirandom as well .      after almost every lemma or theorem we prove in sections 4 - 9 , we have added a  randomization remark \" which considers the functions that we have implicitly defined , states their domain and range , and argues that the functions are semirandom with respect to a certain measure class . in the remarks",
    "we have followed the following principles :    \\1 .",
    "when we write  a random element \" ( of a finite set @xmath1 ) which the reader was previously told to read as  an arbitrary element \" , we now mean  the random element \" of @xmath830 , namely @xmath1593 if @xmath1594 and @xmath1485 is a measure class on @xmath1 we say that @xmath246 is a @xmath7-semirandom element of @xmath1 , with respect to @xmath1485 , if there exists @xmath1487 such that @xmath1595 .",
    "we can replace at will any map @xmath1478 ( or @xmath1453 ) by the linear extension @xmath1468 . this can cause confusion if you think about it the wrong way so we offer the following example to clarify what is going on .    in the hard case of the gsl ,",
    "we take a random third connection ( meaning the random third connection ) , and then cancel out one square @xmath1596 , @xmath898 , of boundaries to get a formal sum of squares @xmath1597 of curves .",
    "we then find , for each new square ( in the formal sum ) a second third connection at random from a set depending on @xmath1597 , to complete the argument .",
    "the right way to think of the randomization ( and linearization ) is that the first operation defines a partial map @xmath1598 and the second operation defines @xmath1599 so we can write @xmath1600 by extending @xmath855 to a map from @xmath1601 to @xmath1602 linearly .",
    "the danger is that one may try to imagine @xmath855 acting on a formal sum of curves by taking the random element from @xmath1603 .",
    "so we will imagine that we are defining functions from @xmath46 to @xmath1418 , or from @xmath46 to @xmath1604 , and only think of them as functions from @xmath1447 to @xmath1604 when we want to compose them .",
