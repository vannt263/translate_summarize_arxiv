    "this paper provides a quantitative basis for exploring policy issues about mathematics education , by painting a comprehensive picture of how , what , and where mathematics is currently studied in american research universities .",
    "the data show that mathematics departments primarily teach `` service '' courses for general education while conducting research on subjects unrelated to undergraduate education .",
    "other departments teach and publish papers on the mathematics subjects that upper division undergraduates study most heavily .    mathematics has two qualities that make it unique in universities .",
    "first , the eponymous department usually has the most student - contact hours of any .",
    "this instruction is concentrated in service courses for liberal education requirements or for prerequisites in other fields .",
    "both groups of students place heavy burdens on the service courses : the first by their quantity , the second because the quality of instruction may determine success in the other fields",
    ". however , the mathematics faculty who supervise the service courses do not perform quantitative analyses for the most part ; indeed , their research topics need have no physical realization ( philosophers discuss the epistemology of such knowledge as the question of mathematics `` foundations '' ) .",
    "second , faculty outside mathematics departments provide most of the specialized mathematics eduction beyond the service courses .",
    "they also write the majority of mathematics papers , moreover , on subjects relevant to advanced undergraduate instruction . since mathematics is not the focus of a single academic department , research universities thus are witness to what is best described as the dissolution of mathematics as a coherent academic discipline .",
    "education and research in mathematics occur outside mathematics departments because the social significance of `` mathematics '' remains close to its etymological meaning of all `` quantitative science '' as the latter is understood today . of the 29,506 doctorates awarded annually by the 96 united states universities with very high research activity ,",
    "58% were in social science , physical science , technology , engineering , or mathematics @xcite , all fields whose research is likely to involve mathematics .",
    "for example , the natural and social sciences formulate and test quantitative theories , which in effect are mathematical models , so progress often depends on mathematical prowess .",
    "additionally , the social and health sciences gather voluminous survey and clinical data , which they analyze using mathematics developed in fields such as econometrics and epidemiology .",
    "finally , the engineering and management sciences build models to mimic complex systems which they understand and may improve , through the models , using the mathematics of game theory , operations research , and systems theory .",
    "few subjects are so pervasive as mathematics in the intellectual life of the research university ; consequently , expertise in mathematics is also ubiquitous .",
    "the subject of this paper are united states research universities . by one assessment",
    "there are 96 institutions with very high research activity , and another 103 with high research activity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , while many institutions declare they support research and attempt to gain financial resources for it , only about 50 universities succeed in obtaining significant funding and perform the majority of notable research .",
    "their effort is considerable .",
    "surveys indicate that the faculty at such universities devote equal amounts of time on average to teaching and research , while the proportion of research time at other doctorate - granting institutions is very much less .    in the united states and in many other countries the smallest administrative units within universities are _ departments _ @xcite .",
    "these units formulate curricula , teach the courses , originate the hiring of staff , and initiate the promotion of ladder staff .",
    "the departments of large or research universities specialize in one academic subject .",
    "this tradition of specialization originated at some european universities in the 19th century and was partly responsible for promoting academic disciplines by creating job markets for faculty with specialized credentials .",
    "this symbiotic relationship between departments and disciplines is not entirely benign because the employment prospects of specialists implicitly depend on maintaining well demarcated disciplines . in this sense , disciplines are `` antithetical to a strong local intellectual community '' within the university .",
    "these deep , sociological roots of specialization are perhaps overlooked when departments are criticized for `` inattention '' to the interdisciplinary needs of undergraduate education @xcite .",
    "the emphasis on interdisciplinary undergraduate education is a curricular feature that especially distinguishes universities in the united states from universities in many other countries .",
    "the need for interdisciplinary eduction arises because entering students are assumed not to have completed their general educations , and the university is responsible for providing that education .",
    "thus , in the nominally 4 year curricula for bachelor s degrees , the _ lower division _",
    "years 12 are devoted to introductory courses from many fields . only during the _ upper division _",
    "years 34 do students concentrate on advanced subjects usually from one field , or what is often the same thing , from one department .",
    "the methodology of this paper differs from previous sociological studies of mathematics in several respects .",
    "most significant is the examination of mathematics throughout the university rather than only in eponymous departments .",
    "all previous studies implicitly equate mathematics with the intellectual content of papers and syllabi written by the faculty of mathematics departments .",
    "it is novel in the extreme to investigate where else mathematics expertise can be found .",
    "further , only quantitative data is gathered to reveal the actual roles of participants rather than perceptions of those roles from opinion survey data .",
    "mathematics activity is observed through databases for university courses , enrollments , and publications .",
    "comments on the straightforward procedures that were employed to gather each type of data are included with the results .",
    "the data used throughout this paper are from 50 institutions that are profiled in * tables [ tab : overview ] and [ tab : personnel ] * of the appendix .",
    "these institutions have the most highly rated mathematics departments in the following sense .",
    "the national research council produced the most authoritative recent ranking of mathematics research - doctorate programs in united states universities .",
    "each department received a composite , numerical rating between 0.00 and 5.00 .",
    "the american mathematical society groups departments with similar ratings to report annual statistics on employment in mathematics departments @xcite .",
    "group i consists of the 48 most highly ranked departments , with ratings from 3.00 to 5.00 .",
    "all but two of the 48 are from the 96 universities with very high research activity in the carnegie classification , and the remaining 2 are from the 103 universities with high activity .",
    "the group i cadre thus provides a reasonably objective and quite broad sample of mathematics research departments .",
    "two additional institutions are included because they provide some rarely available data that is used in section [ sec : coursework ] .",
    "this investigation requires a method to recognize , quantify , and classify mathematics research .",
    "fortunately , that burden of subjectivity is assumed by two comprehensive surveys of research publications . unlike the social sciences with which readers may be more familiar , many of the physical sciences index their research publications .",
    "these indexes include all peer - reviewed publications from any source that skilled editors judge to have contributed to the field .",
    "mathematics has two indexing agencies sponsored respectively by the american and european mathematical societies .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite maintain databases of papers indexed by mathematics subject .",
    "currently , _ zentralblatt",
    "_ surveys 3,500 journals and 1,100 serials for mathematics papers and indexes approximately 100,000 new peer - reviewed publications per year . since 1971",
    "_ zentralblatt _ has collected 2.39 million publications all of which are indexed by the mathematical subject classification ( msc ) .",
    "this subject index consists of alphanumeric codes beginning with 2-digit numbers that reflect the coarsest level of differentiation , that is , the major branches of mathematics .",
    "sixty - three of these 2-digit numbers are assigned .    for the purposes of this paper , mathematics research",
    "is quantified by the numbers of peer - reviewed papers indexed by _",
    "zentralblatt_. this data can be used to make a census of mathematics papers in the form of the percent of papers that address each major subject class ( * figure [ fig : census ] * ) .",
    "for example , when the data were gathered in spring 2010 , the _ zentralblatt _ database had 86,517 papers with an index code in the `` quantum theory '' classification , 81 .",
    "as noted , 2.39 million papers in the database had been assigned codes .",
    "thus , approximately 86,517@xmath0 or 3.62 percent of all mathematics papers contribute to the mathematics of quantum theory .",
    "this value is recorded in figure [ fig : census ] . since a paper may have multiple subjects , the percentages in the figure sum to 155.7 .",
    "the 10 subjects listed atop figure [ fig : census ] account for half the 2.39 million peer - reviewed papers .    .",
    "]    this census of mathematical research reflects current interests because most of the indexed papers have been written in the recent past .",
    "the quantity of mathematics publications has consistently increased by approximately 2,000 papers per year in recent decades , with the result that 68% of the papers indexed by _",
    "zentralblatt _ are from 19902009 .",
    "if the data in figure [ fig : census ] were restricted to just the past two decades , then the primary change among the heavily published subjects is to increase the percent of papers about the mathematics of computer science because computer science is a comparatively new field .",
    "undergraduate instruction is a natural starting point for an investigation of mathematics in universities .",
    "the numeraire for measuring university instruction is the student credit - hour , sch . the acronym is sometimes misinterpreted , and the concept is better understood , as a student - contact hour .",
    "an sch represents one student who is being `` credited , '' for purposes of earning a degree , with one hour per week of supervised study per academic term .",
    "the concept arose in the united states as a quantitative measure of educational achievement to replace comprehensive examinations ; the latter persist in europe and in graduate studies .",
    "@xcite describes the history of the credit - hour and the vagaries of its calculation . from the standpoint of the university , credit - hours or contact hours",
    "measure how much effort university employees devote to education each week .",
    "all universities compile credit - hour data for their own use and for accreditation purposes .",
    "data are usually given to the public summarized by campus , college , or school , but only occasionally by department ( equivalently , by subject ) and in a very few cases in even more detail . the lack of public access is responsible for considering relatively few universities in this section ; however , the results for them are so overwhelming that there is no evidence opposed to the conclusions .    the supplies credit - hour data by semester , department , and the degree level of the student .",
    "undergraduate credit - hours for fall 2008 totaled 499,650 to which the department of mathematics contributed an astonishing 38,386 or 7.7% .",
    "the mathematics department is the largest educational steward in austin ( * figure [ fig : sch]a * ) .",
    "this rank seems to be held generally .",
    "mathematics departments are among the two largest in terms of undergraduate credit - hours for each of the few universities providing detailed data to the public . perhaps more remarkable",
    "is that , across all the universities considered , mathematics is the only department that consistently ranks among those with the most undergraduate credit hours .",
    "[ fig : sch ]    more insight into mathematics coursework comes from universities that report data for more finely differentiated student levels .",
    "the @xcite , the @xcite , and @xcite report credit - hours separately for lower division undergraduate students and for upper division students .",
    "these universities are comparably sized with respectively 236,302 , 225,801 , and 267,607 undergraduate student credit - hours in fall 2008 .",
    "the mathematics departments supply 6% of the undergraduate student credit - hours at the first two institutions and a very high 10% at the third ( * figures [ fig : sch]b  d * ) .",
    "the more detailed data reveal most of these credit - hours are for lower division students . the upper to lower",
    "division ratio of sch in mathematics courses is 0.37 : 1 in eugene and a remarkably small 0.074 : 1 and 0.037 : 1 at santa cruz and auburn , respectively .",
    "still greater insight comes from the @xcite campus in the `` twin cities '' of minneapolis and saint paul .",
    "this campus is comprehensive in the extreme , with professional schools of agriculture , business , engineering , law , and medicine .",
    "the university had 947,540 undergraduate student credit - hours in total for the fall , spring , and summer terms of the 20052006 academic year .",
    "minnesota credit - hour data are reported by course numbers that reflect the year after matriculation in which students are anticipated to take the courses .",
    "freshman courses are `` 1xxx , '' sophomore `` 2xxx , '' and so on .",
    "the @xcite indicates this course numbering scheme is informally honored , so the numbers provide a reasonable indicator of course sophistication . interpreting lower division courses as those numbered `` 1xxx '' and `` 2xxx , '' the upper to lower division ratio of credit - hours for the school of mathematics is 0.19 : 1 , consistent with the other schools .",
    "the observation enabled by this data is , mathematics departments provide by far the majority of their credit - hours in freshman courses ( * figure [ fig : sch]e * ) .",
    "the conceit , that science and technology are impossible without sophisticated mathematics , can be reconciled with figures [ fig : sch]b[fig : sch]e ( which show that mathematics departments mostly teach lower division courses ) only if substantial mathematics education occurs outside mathematics departments .",
    "the extent of this teaching is difficult to quantify because course catalogs do not itemize the pertinent courses under the rubric `` mathematics . ''",
    "consequently , class catalogs , course descriptions , syllabi , and textbooks all have to be examined to identify courses with mathematical content .",
    "these documents at the @xcite are easily perused , and the coursework at this institution has already been examined in section [ sec : coursework ] , so the very large student body of this research university is taken as representative . all upper division courses offered in the fall and spring semesters of the 20082009 academic year",
    "are canvassed .",
    "mathematics courses are identified by matching them to specific items in the mathematics subject classification .",
    "this approach assures a rigorous selection process .",
    "for example , the department of finance offered fin 357 , business finance .",
    "one professor @xcite assigned chapter 4 of the text `` discounted cash flow valuation , '' and he scheduled lectures on net present value .",
    "this course therefore taught subjects under mathematics subject classification 91b28 , `` finance , portfolios , investment , '' or most broadly under subject 91 , `` game theory , economics , social and behavioral sciences . ''",
    "there were 15 sections of fin 357 in the fall and 8 in the spring , each meeting 3 hours per week , totaling 69 weekly class - hours devoted to subject area 91 ( game theory , economics ) .",
    "for further example , 80% of the 203 upper division class - hours in department of computer sciences courses have mathematics content .",
    "some courses are associated with more than one subject area .",
    "cs 320n , practical linear algebra",
    "i @xcite , teaches how `` to attain high performance on current cache - based architectures , '' which is mathematics subject classification 68n19 , `` other programming techniques . ''",
    "the course textbook @xcite discusses topics in mathematics subject classification 15 , `` linear and multilinear algebra , matrix theory . '' consequently , the 6 class - hours for this course are divided between subject classes 15 ( linear algebra ) and 68 ( computer science ) .",
    "altogether 252 upper division courses were identified with 667 sections meeting 2,197 hours per week during the fall or spring semesters .",
    "the distribution of these upper division class - hours with respect to the branches of mathematics and the departments offering the courses gives a reasonably accurate and very novel quantification of upper division instruction in mathematics subjects ( * figure [ fig : courses ] * ) .",
    "several areas of mathematics individually contribute 4% or more of class - hours , as follows :        * * computer science * , mathematics subject code 68 , accounts for about 14% of the upper division class - hours .",
    "the departments of computer sciences and of electrical and computer engineering provide most of the instruction in the mathematics of computer science ; their courses overlap considerably as a result . * * economics * , code 91 , also accounts for about 14% of mathematics class - hours , but in several departments .",
    "the department of finance teaches how to value monetary instruments in business finance courses such as the one discussed above , fin 357 .",
    "many engineering departments teach similar mathematics in courses about the financial management of engineering projects .",
    "the department of economics teaches the broadest range of subjects including game theory , eco 354k , and econometrics , eco 341k .",
    "the latter is one of those courses that address two areas of mathematics , 91 and 62 . * * statistics * , 62 , accounts for 8% of the class - hours , the third largest .",
    "if the university of texas at austin had a statistics department , it likely would inherit the class - hours of the department of mathematics , which are only a quarter of those offered .",
    "the subject is also taught in many departments of engineering and social science .",
    "the campus does not have a medical school , else courses in biostatistics and epidemiology might well increase the class hours in statistics to rival computer science and economics . *",
    "if * mathematical physics * were considered a separate subject class to consolidate the mathematics of fluid and solid mechanics 76 and 74 , statistical and orbital mechanics 70 , and thermodynamics 80 , then it would account for over 14% of class - hours .",
    "the department of mechanical engineering teaches half the class - hours for these subjects . *",
    "* control theory * , 93 , is mostly taught in the department of mechanical engineering , although at other universities it may also be found in aerospace engineering .",
    "* the department of electrical and computer engineering alone teaches the mathematics of * information and communication theory * , 94 .",
    "* the department of mathematics teaches half the class hours in * numerical analysis * , 65 , with the rest taught by a variety of engineering departments . *",
    "* operations research * , 90 , is taught in the department of information , risk and operations management with the rest again taught by various engineering departments .",
    "this data has been gathered from a single university but the conclusion is broadly supported , that much mathematics education occurs outside mathematics departments . since mathematics is used throughout the sciences , and since mathematics departments primarily teach lower division courses ( as seen in section [ sec : coursework ] ) , the necessary instruction in specialized or advanced mathematics must occur elsewhere .",
    "the 2,197 class hours weekly in mathematics give a rough estimate of the student credit - hours .",
    "the university does not provide registration data for individual courses ; however , texas statutes require universities to `` offer only such courses and teach such classes as are economically justified '' .",
    "the @xcite interprets this law to mean undergraduate courses should have at least 10 students .",
    "upper division courses are not anticipated to be large , so it is reasonable to suppose an average section size of 25 .",
    "the 2,197 class - hours thus suggest 54,925 weekly student - contact hours in upper division mathematics instruction in total for both semesters .",
    "recall , the university has approximately one - half million undergraduate student credit - hours per semester .    with at most only about 5% of student - contact hours devoted to upper division mathematics ,",
    "the methods of instruction must be particularly effective . even though most courses may be taught in conventional lectures , syllabi that contain a mixture of mathematics and other subjects are unconventional in their treatment of mathematics .",
    "they introduce the mathematics early , so the remainder of the course effectively becomes a practicum for the mathematics .",
    "for example , phy 333 , modern optics @xcite , successively treats geometric optics , vectors and matrices in the jones calculus , and fourier transforms , each followed by studies of optics using this mathematics .",
    "mathematics departments have recognized the value of this type of instruction where it is generally called `` experience in model building . '' among the 2,197 section hours , the mathematics department has 3 for m 474 m , mathematical modeling in science and engineering .",
    "most of the courses outside the mathematics department teach mathematics in this way .",
    "having obtained data on instruction , the discussion turns to research activity .",
    "the 48 leading mathematics departments have 2,108 ladder staff with primary appointments in them as of spring 2010 .",
    "their research papers were obtained from the _ zentralblatt _ database by subject classification and by university .",
    "this method avoids double - counting jointly - written papers when all authors belong to the same institution : 63,874 papers were obtained .",
    "these peer - reviewed papers are all research of all ladder faculty at all departments that the american mathematical society regards as leading research in mathematics ; therefore , there is no sampling error in the following discussion .    .",
    "]    the 63,874 papers have the subject distribution shown in * figure [ fig : ext - and - int]a*. comparing figures [ fig : census ] and [ fig : ext - and - int]a indicates the research interests of leading mathematics departments are unrepresentative of all mathematics .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : census ] , about 1.6% of all mathematics papers are about manifolds and cell complexes 57 , while in figure [ fig : ext - and - int]a , mathematics departments write 7.0% of their papers about this subject .",
    "perhaps more significant , 9.9% of all mathematics papers in figure [ fig : census ] are about computer science 68 , the most of any subject , while in figure [ fig : ext - and - int]a only 4.3% of the papers written in mathematics departments are about the mathematics of computer science .",
    "the research emphasis of a group of mathematicians may be defined as the ratio of the fraction of their papers on a subject to the fraction of all mathematics papers on the subject .",
    "this quantity provides a criterion to identify subjects in which mathematics departments have more or less expertise .",
    "it is convenient to represent the ratio as a base @xmath1 logarithm , so an emphasis in favor has a positive value and an emphasis against has a negative value .",
    "* figure [ fig : emphasis ] * reports the research emphasis of mathematics department ladder staff .",
    "mathematics departments have a strong negative emphasis ( less than @xmath2 ) against 13 subjects that are darkly shaded in figures [ fig : census ] , [ fig : ext - and - int ] , and [ fig : emphasis ] .",
    "they have a moderate negative emphasis ( between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) against 19 subjects that are lightly shaded in the figures .",
    "remarkably , these figures show mathematics departments have a negative research emphasis for 8 of the 10 areas of mathematics at the top of figure [ fig : census ] about which the most research is conducted .     and [ fig : ext - and - int ] . ]      mathematics departments de - emphasize research in the most heavily published mathematics subjects ( comparing figure [ fig : emphasis ] with figure [ fig : census ] ) .",
    "consequently others must write many of the papers . in order to identify the authors",
    ", this section examines departments other than mathematics at the same 48 universities with the leading mathematics departments .",
    "* table [ tab : departments ] * in the appendix lists the selected departments .",
    "they have been chosen to be among those that figure [ fig : courses ] shows provide much of the upper division mathematics instruction at the university of texas .",
    "these non - mathematics departments had 13,701 ladder staff with primary appointments in them in spring 2010 . like the investigation of mathematics departments , papers in the _ zentralblatt _",
    "database are gathered by subject classification for the whole sample at each university to avoid double - counting jointly - written papers .",
    "the subject distribution of the 75,125 papers that were written by members of the chosen non - mathematics departments indicates that the mathematics research interests of authors outside mathematics departments are largely complementary to those inside ( * figure [ fig : ext - and - int]b * ) .",
    "a reasonable measure of expertise in any subject is having written 10 peer - reviewed publications .",
    "the ratio of such authors outside and inside the mathematics departments of the 48 universities is at least @xmath4 ( * figure [ fig : productivitybyauthor ] * ) .",
    "thus research universities have more mathematically expert faculty outside their mathematics departments than inside .",
    "the ratio can only increase by including more departments of natural or social science in the selection of non - mathematics departments . with the present sample the mathematics departments have more authors of mathematics papers only for authors of 22 or more papers .",
    "writing so many mathematics papers is a remarkable achievement for faculty outside mathematics departments because they also may write papers in their primary fields of study .     in the appendix",
    "lists the selected non - mathematics departments . ]",
    "faculty who conduct research in mathematics are equally productive inside and outside mathematics departments . based on the criterion of having written 10 or more mathematics papers , the contingent outside mathematics department is larger at 38 of the 48 institutions ( * figure [ fig : productivitybydept ] * ) . this group is smaller at some institutions such as brandeis and new york university that lack extensive collections of professional schools .",
    "a characteristic of excellence in comprehensive research universities may be that mathematics research skills are distributed throughout the faculty .     in the appendix lists the selected non - mathematics departments .",
    "the aforementioned mathematics faculties inside and outside mathematics departments are not discussed in the sociology of science or of higher education , so some new naming convention is needed to refer to them .",
    "borrowing terminology from the physical sciences , the `` intensive '' mathematics faculty are members of mathematics departments .",
    "the `` extensive '' faculty are tenured and tenure - track staff who teach mathematics or write mathematics papers outside mathematics departments .",
    "the analogy with physical properties is , the quantity of extensive faculty varies in proportion to the size of the whole natural and social science faculty .",
    "the extensive faculty are not necessarily mathematicians by training or preference .",
    "nevertheless , they perform as such , by teaching upper division courses whose syllabi include mathematics subjects not taught elsewhere , and by writing the majority of papers that bibliographic services regard as having mathematics content . the observation , that significant research activity for any field occurs apart from the academic department nominally associated with the field , appears to be unprecedented .",
    "the extensive faculty do not coincide just with those faculty outside mathematics who conduct research on mathematics subjects .",
    "many faculty may teach mathematics subjects that they know but on which they do not publish because teaching duties typically are broader than research interests .",
    "nevertheless , the results of this study show the extensive faculty contains sizeable numbers of individuals who do publish significantly in mathematics ( figures [ fig : productivitybyauthor ] , [ fig : productivitybydept ] ) , and moreover these faculty produce the bulk of research about certain mathematics subjects ( figure [ fig : ext - and - int]b ) .",
    "the results of this study reveal a significant dichotomy between the extensive and intensive mathematics faculties .",
    "the extensive faculty write papers on the mathematics s ubjects they teach , whereas mathematics departments write papers on subjects that are largely separate from their undergraduate teaching .",
    "a meaningful data reduction begins by selecting the mathematics subject areas that are most important in the teaching or publications of the extensive or intensive faculties .",
    "publication subjects are chosen by applying a 4% threshold to figures [ fig : ext - and - int]a and [ fig : ext - and - int]b ; that is , a subject must be addressed in either 4% of papers written by the extensive faculty , or separately 4% of papers written by the intensive faculty .",
    "teaching subjects are chosen similarly from a 3% threshold on the class - hours in figure [ fig : courses ] .",
    "this figure reports consolidated percentages that must be adjusted for purposes of selection to reflect class - hours of the extensive or intensive faculties alone .",

    "meta - disciplines have been broadly characterized as fields that encompass the representation of knowledge in other fields .",

    "if mathematics occurs in another field , it should not be presumed that only the application of a mathematical meta - process has transpired . to the contrary , often the relevant mathematics originated in the other field . for example , c.  f.  @xcite discovered the method of least squares , or regression analysis , during his work in astronomy and geodesy .",

    "united states research universities have no consistent organizational structure for meta - disciplines such as mathematics whose expertise spreads across many fields . considering just academic departments that involve considerable mathematics knowledge , the 48 group i universities ( section [ sec : sample ] ) have disparate departments ( table [ tab : departments ] ) often in different colleges of the university . for example",

    "the mathematics of computer science is the purview of one or two departments variously called `` computer science , '' `` computer and information science '' and `` electrical and computer engineering '' that are found in engineering or in science colleges . separating computer science from mathematics",
    "has been described as detrimental @xcite .",
    "one may conjecture that the same applies to other subjects as well .",
    "statistics is a specific organizational challenge that all universities faced simultaneously and for which there is some historical narrative .",
    "universities were urged to create statistics departments in the middle half of the 20th century because mathematics departments failed to add statisticians to their faculties in proportion to the growing demand for statisticians in government and industry .",
    "@xcite alleged that mathematics departments viewed teaching statistics as service work that did not require a commitment to research , thereby allowing new positions to be filled by specialists in other mathematics , thus decreasing the acuity of the statistics instruction .",
    "whatever the case , administrations did not respond uniformly to their `` statistics problem , '' suggesting that they failed to resolve it . some universities continue to teach statistics in their mathematics departments , while many have statistics departments now ( table [ tab : departments ] ) , and all universities allow the subject to be taught by other departments as well @xcite . these solutions may be reasonable except in so far as addressing what it means to maintain mathematics as a meta - discipline . exhortations to be `` more interdisciplinary '' and `` more mathematical '' are a common stopgap .    for several years , mathematics departments in the united states have had significant , precipitous declines in both undergraduate degrees and graduate enrollments , while at the same time , there has been essentially no decline in tenured faculty @xcite .",
    "as national economic conditions strain financial support for higher education , many institutions may look for economies in their mathematics programs . faced with similar hardships a decade earlier , for example , one university proposed to employ only non - ladder staff for lower division mathematics instruction in the numerous service courses ( to be supervised by natural and social science faculty ) , and to curtail the graduate mathematics program @xcite .",
    "such proposals may engender vehement objections on the grounds that mathematics is a core academic discipline .",
    "however compelling that view may be , this paper shows the objections are not apropos the policy question , because the core of advanced undergraduate mathematics education occurs outside mathematics departments .",
    "the proper justification for maintaining mathematics does not appear to be that it is a core discipline , rather that it is a meta - discipline , but then in what form should it be maintained ?",
    "the failure to recognize the ramifications of mathematics as a meta - discipline , with a large `` extensive '' faculty outside mathematics departments , extends beyond university organizational structures .",
    "studies of the sociology and philosophy of mathematics have focussed on the foundational issue concerning the epistemology of pure abstractions and its significance for education .",
    "this approach amounts to restricting the view of mathematics to the intensive faculty and ignoring the extensive faculty .",
    "the pure abstractions in the research of the intensive faculty are doubly removed from reality because , in view of figure [ fig : venn ] , mathematics departments conduct research predominantly on subjects they do not teach to the educated public , who consist of university graduates with four - year degrees .",
    "thus , the `` foundational question '' is a gedankenversuch for philosophers and sociologists that is moot for society .",
    "in contrast , the extensive mathematics faculty conduct research on tangibles whose meaning is undoubtable .",
    "for example , the professor of fin 357 wrote a paper @xcite about asset valuation formulas , and the professor of cs 320n wrote a paper @xcite about devising algorithms for computers .",
    "a philosophical question about mathematics that would appear to be more relevant to society and education is the one asked by eugene @xcite : why is mathematics so successful in reasoning about reality ?",
    "twentieth century k-12 educational policy in the united states has been characterized as a continual disagreement between educators , mathematicians , and parents .",
    "how to prepare students to enter universities is a paramount concern , yet in view of the many departments that provide upper division mathematics instruction ( figure [ fig : courses ] ) , participants in the k-12 debate may lack a comprehensive understanding of university mathematics .",
    "for example , k-12 educators acquire their own conception of mathematics from mathematics departments rather than from the majority of mathematics researchers who make up the extensive faculty .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in an era of accountability and amidst brewing controversy concerning mathematics education s goals and emphasis , mathematicians and mathematics educators continued to work together to formulate recommendations for how teachers could develop the mathematical and pedagogical knowledge and skills they would need to help all students learn . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    natural and social science faculty recently insisted that statistics be included in curricular standards for university - bound students in spite of mathematics faculty who felt statistics was `` not necessarily a prerequisite for success '' . the suggestion that departments other than mathematics might set standards for k-12 education is considered to be novel @xcite .",
    "since the mathematics educations of many university students are completed by the extensive mathematics faculty , their view of the mathematics skills needed by university students would appear to be relevant to k-12 education .      at the turn of the last century , the united states @xcite began a grant program , vigre , for `` departments in the mathematical sciences to carry out high quality educational programs , at all levels , that are vertically integrated with the research activities of these departments . '' in short , the purpose was to improve university education in mathematics .",
    "grants were awarded entirely to mathematics departments @xcite .",
    "these funds may have been misdirected because , as figure [ fig : courses ] indicates , 79% of upper division mathematics student credit hours are taught outside mathematics departments to students who earn degrees in other departments .",
    "there is no systematic effort to address undergraduate university mathematics in a comprehensive manner . referring to the extensive faculty",
    ", @xcite finds an exciting `` stealth curriculum that thrives outside the confining boundaries of college and university mathematics departments . ''",
    "in summary , this paper shows that united states research universities have an `` intensive '' mathematics faculty inside a department of the same name , and an `` extensive '' mathematics faculty spread across other departments .",
    "the two faculties perform different roles in education and research .",
    "the intensive and extensive faculties teach lower or upper division students , respectively , and they conduct research in mathematics subjects either unrelated or relevant to upper division students , also respectively .",
    "united states research universities have not been successful in aligning the teaching and research responsibilities of their mathematics department faculties . in contrast , the mathematics research conducted by faculty outside the mathematics department is aligned with the vocational interests of undergraduate students .",
    "the existence of the extensive faculty has not been appreciated previously because an examination of the education literature indicates that the contributions of the faculty outside mathematics departments are not recognized in formulating national policies for mathematics education .",
    "this study suggests several questions for further investigation .",
    "one is whether other fields besides mathematics , such as other meta - disciplines , have similar `` two - tier '' faculties consisting of a formal , intensive faculty in one department and an informal , extensive faculty in other departments .",
    "further is the question of how these separate faculties developed in the department - based organization of research universities and what they mean for the discipline - based organization of science . from the standpoint of educational administration it is relevant to study the attitudes of the intensive and extensive faculty toward the other group and their perception of their own roles in the two - tier system .",
    "these attitudes evidently affect how university - wide curriculum is established .",
    "coordination would appear to be through informal arrangements because direct administration would have to cut across the boundaries of departments and colleges which , ipso facto , are independent in formulating curricula .",
    "the utimate question is whether the two - tier approach is effective in promoting excellence in either research or education .",
    "as has written , the united states approach to education involves an interdependent system , but not necessarily one that reflects a rational design or that functions perfectly .",
    "i wish to thank the editor , prof .  c.  musselin , and the reviewers for comments and suggestions that greatly improved this paper .",
