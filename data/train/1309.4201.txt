    "although uncertainties in numerical factors of order unity in both the threshold and maximum values were noticed in the original paper , the uncertainties have often been omitted in the subsequent literature .",
    "however , the uncertainty of factor 2 in the threshold value @xmath12 results in enormous uncertainty in the prediction of the abundance of primordial black holes if we are given the power spectrum of the density perturbation because @xmath13 should be much greater than the standard deviation @xmath14 . the maximum value @xmath15 , which was originally regarded as the separate universe condition  @xcite , has recently been shown  @xcite to be purely geometrical .",
    "since nadezhin , novikov , and polnarev  @xcite pioneered the fully general relativistic numerical simulations of primordial black hole formation , the threshold of primordial black hole formation has been extensively investigated by numerical relativity  @xcite .",

    "the original analysis by carr  @xcite is based on the physical argument that for an overdensity to form a primordial black hole , the size of the overdensity at the maximum expansion @xmath26 should be larger than the jeans radius @xmath27 ( the jeans criterion ) but smaller than the particle horizon size @xmath28 , which is comparable with the curvature scale of the overdense region .",

    "as carr  @xcite indicated , if the equation of state is sufficiently soft , nonspherical effects play important roles rather than the jeans criterion .",
    "kopp , hofmann , and weller  @xcite pointed out that the maximum value @xmath15 is not directly related to the separate universe but to the geometry of the overdense region .",

    "our formula also suggests that primordial black holes can be formed from type i fluctuations even for very hard equations of state , i.e. , @xmath211 , because @xmath5 is well below @xmath212 .",
    "conventionally , it has been assumed that the probability distribution for the density perturbation follows a gaussian distribution .",
    "then , the fraction @xmath213 of the universe which goes into primordial black holes of mass scale @xmath34 at the formation epoch is given by @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the standard deviation of the density perturbation of mass scale @xmath34 , the factor 2 comes from the press ",

    "@xmath222 ( or @xmath224 ) can be arbitrarily large even for @xmath229 , where the density perturbation @xmath64 is sufficiently small .",
    "moreover , unlike @xmath64 , @xmath222 monotonically increases from 0 to @xmath230 as @xmath219 increases from 0 to @xmath75 .",
