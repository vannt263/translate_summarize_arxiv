    "nearly a quarter of a century has passed since peres @xcite made an important advance in understanding the origin of irreversibility in quantum theory .",
    "he pioneered a framework in which dynamical instabilities were studied in terms of small external perturbations of the hamilton operator without resorting to the classical concepts of mixing and coarse graining .",
    "in particular , peres convincingly demonstrated that a change in the time evolution of a quantum system caused by the perturbation is largely determined by whether the system exhibits regular or chaotic behavior in the classical limit .",
    "the quantity addressed by peres , currently known as the _ loschmidt echo _ ( le ) in the quantum chaos community and the _ fidelity _ in the field of quantum information , is defined as @xcite @xmath0 it is the squared overlap of the initial state @xmath1 and the state obtained by propagating @xmath1 though time @xmath2 under the original , unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath3 , and then through time @xmath4 under the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "the le , @xmath6 , is a measure of the time - reversibility of a system s dynamics under `` imperfect conditions '' . in an alternative interpretation",
    ", the le characterizes the distance between two states in the hilbert space , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , both obtained from the same initial state , @xmath9 , in the course of the quantum evolution through time @xmath2 under two different hamiltonians , @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively . by construction , @xmath10 assuming the initial state is normalized .",
    "typically , @xmath6 decreases ( or `` decays '' ) with increasing time , and the precise functional form of the decay is determined by the nature of the hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath5 , as well as by the initial state .",
    "interest to the subject of the le revived a decade ago .",
    "this was largely due to the discovery of a perturbation independent regime @xcite of the le decay in systems that exhibit chaotic dynamics in the classical limit . in this regime , known as the lyapunov regime",
    ", the le decays exponentially in time , @xmath11 , with the decay rate @xmath12 equal to the average lyapunov exponent of the corresponding classical system .",
    "the lyapunov regime can be considered as a clear example of how classical chaos manifests itself in a quantum mechanical world .",
    "roughly speaking , for chaotic systems under the action of _ global _ hamiltonian perturbations , i.e. , perturbations affecting a dominant part of the system s phase space , one identifies three distinct decay regimes of the le : the gaussian perturbative regime @xcite for `` weak '' perturbations , the exponential fermi - golden - rule ( fgr ) regime @xcite for `` moderate '' perturbation strengths , and the exponential lyapunov regime @xcite for `` strong '' perturbations .",
    "the above three regimes serve as a basis for the theory of the le decay for global perturbation .",
    "the full theory however is much more subtle and the interested reader is referred to two comprehensive review articles , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the le due to global perturbations has long been a subject of numerous experimental studies .",
    "most notably these are experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , microwave cavities @xcite , and elastodynamics @xcite .    in recent years , hamiltonian perturbations of a new kind , namely perturbations that are _ local _ in phase space , have been addressed in the context of the le decay both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in a semiclassical picture ,",
    "a local perturbation is concentrated in a small region of the system s phase space , so that the length of a typical trajectory between any two successive visits of the perturbation region is much larger than the system s size . in strongly chaotic systems",
    "the phase space extent of a local perturbation can be characterized by an `` escape '' rate @xmath13 defined as the rate at which trajectories of the corresponding classical system visit the perturbation region .",
    "the semiclassical analysis of the le for times longer than the ehrenfest time , i.e. , longer than the time it takes for an initially localized wave packet to explore the available phase space , has revealed an exponential decay regime , @xmath14 , in which the decay rate @xmath15 is a non - monotonous function of the perturbation strength @xcite . in particular , for sufficiently weak perturbations the fgr regime is recovered in which @xmath15 grows quadratically with the perturbations strength .",
    "however , in the limit of strong perturbations @xmath15 saturates at a perturbation independent value @xmath16 corresponding to the so - called escape - rate regime .",
    "the crossover from the fgr to the escape - rate regime is non - monotonous , and @xmath15 exhibits well pronounced oscillations as a function of the perturbations strength .",
    "these oscillations have been then confirmed in numerical experiments with perturbed cat maps @xcite and , more recently , in laboratory experiments with microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "finally , the limit of point - like perturbations , for which @xmath17 , was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the le was shown to decay algebraically with time , @xmath18 .",
    "the existing theory of the le decay from local perturbations is only applicable to times long compared to the ehrenfest time .",
    "however , in certain cases the short time decay of the echo , during which the unperturbed and perturbed quantum states can be described by localized wave packets , might be of significant importance for understanding results of laboratory experiments .",
    "for instance , in echo spectroscopy experiments with cold atoms trapped inside an optical billiard @xcite one typically observes the echo decay for times as short as only few free flight times of the corresponding classical billiard .",
    "such time scales can be short compared to the ehrenfest time depending on a parameter choice .",
    "it is the objective of this paper to address the short - time decay of the le due to local hamiltonian perturbations .",
    "more specifically , we make the first step in this direction by performing a detailed study of the le in one - dimensional ( and , more generally , quasi - one - dimensional ) systems in the presence of localized perturbations of the system s potential . we show that in such systems @xmath6 is typically a non - monotonous function exhibiting well pronounced minima and maxima at times when the particle traverses the perturbation region .",
    "we also show that in closed systems the envelope of @xmath6 can be well approximated by a gaussian , @xmath19 $ ] , with the decay time @xmath20 explicitly expressible in terms of system parameters .",
    "all results presented in this paper concern the le decay in `` clean '' systems and imply no averaging over initial states or hamiltonian perturbations .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper only concerns the short - time decay of the le in conservative quasi - one - dimensional , and therefore essentially integrable , systems .",
    "the case of the le decay in classically chaotic systems for times shorter than the ehrenfest time ( and in the presence of global perturbations ) was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , for a `` typical '' localized initial state @xmath21 , the le was shown to exhibit the double - exponential initial decay , @xmath22 with @xmath12 being the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_1d ]",
    "we provide the analysis of the le decay in one - dimensional systems based on full numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation and on the thawed gaussian approximation ( tga ) in its standard and modified , average potential formulations .",
    "details on the average potential tga are deferred to appendix  [ section_tga ] .",
    "particular examples treated in section  [ section_1d ] include a free particle ( sec .",
    "[ section_free ] ) , particle on a ring ( sec .",
    "[ section_ring ] ) , harmonic ( sec .",
    "[ section_harmonic ] ) and anharmonic ( sec .",
    "[ section_anharmonic ] ) oscillators .",
    "section  [ section_2d ] demonstrates disappearance of non - monotonous features of the le decay as a quasi - one - dimensional system is transformed into a substantially two - dimensional system . in section  [ section_conclusions ]",
    "we give a discussion of our results and make concluding remarks .",
    "the essential physics of the short - time decay of the le for local potential perturbations can already be revealed by considering the simplest physical system  a free particle . in this scenario ,",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath23 , describes one - dimensional motion of a free particle of mass @xmath24 ; in the coordinate representation , the momentum operator @xmath25 . the perturbed hamiltonian , @xmath26 , represents a particle interacting with a potential `` barrier '' @xmath27 localized to an interval on the position axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . for concreteness , we assume @xmath27 to have a single maximum ( or minimum ) at @xmath28 .",
    "( as it will become clear from the following presentation , our results can be easily generalized to perturbation potentials of arbitrary shape . )",
    "we also label the characteristic extent of the potential by @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . finally , we set the initial state to be a gaussian wave packet , @xmath30 that represents a quantum particle with the average position coordinate @xmath31 and momentum @xmath32 . the initial wave packet dispersion is quantified by @xmath33 .",
    "we further assume that the initial state , @xmath34 , has zero overlap with the perturbation potential , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the characteristic distance between the particle and the perturbation region , see fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "we also assume that the initial state is well localized in the momentum space , so that @xmath37 and that the potential @xmath27 constitutes a classically small perturbation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total energy of the corresponding classical particle .",
    "together eqs .",
    "( [ condition-2 ] ) and ( [ condition-3 ] ) imply that the probability density gets almost perfectly transmitted over the barrier in the course of the time evolution , and the effect of quantum reflections can be neglected .",
    "most of semiclassical studies of the le decay rely on the so - called `` dephasing representation '' ( dr ) @xcite , in which the le amplitude @xmath40 is expressed as an interference integral over trajectories of the unperturbed system , modulated by a `` dephasing '' factor due to the perturbation , with initial phase space coordinates weighed by the wigner function of the state @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis however is based on a different analytical approach , namely on the `` thawed gaussian '' approximation ( tga ) @xcite in its standard and extended versions , see appendix  [ section_tga ] and the discussion below .",
    "the tga , unlike the dr , involves only a single trajectory transporting the wave packet center through phase space in the course of its time evolution .",
    "this allows for greater analytical flexibility at the expense of a reduction in accuracy . for most of our purposes",
    "however the tga proves to be sufficiently reliable both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "according to the tga both the unperturbed and perturbed wave functions preserve their gaussian form in the course of their time evolution : @xmath41 where @xmath42 labels the unperturbed and perturbed wave functions respectively , and @xmath43 stands for the real part . here , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46",

    "however , a proper investigation is yet to be performed .    as a final remark",
    "we make the following counter - intuitive observation . by increasing the parameter @xmath224 , while keeping @xmath126 fixed , one increases the overall presence of the perturbation , in the sense that the integral @xmath245 becomes larger",
    ". however , at the same time , the larger @xmath224 the higher the le saturation value , see fig  [ fig-7 ] , and therefore the smaller the effect of the perturbation on the time evolution of the wave function .",
    "the reason for that is that it is energetically preferable for a wave function to avoid small perturbation regions by changing its shape .",
    "this results in small values of the le overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "spatially extended perturbation regions are traversed by the wave function without any significant shape change resulting in large values of the le overlap .",
    "we have studied , analytically and numerically , the decay of the loschmidt echo ( le ) from local hamiltonian perturbations for times short compared to the ehrenfest time . during those times",
    "the quantum states of the unperturbed and perturbed systems can be efficiently approximated by localized gaussian wave packets .",
    "the latter evolve in accordance with equations of the thawed gaussian approximation ( tga ) .",
    "we have analyzed these equations and deduced several important properties of the le decay in quasi - one - dimensional systems .",

    "more specifically , @xmath6 exhibits strongly pronounced minima and maxima at the instants of time when the corresponding classical particle traverses the perturbation region .",
    "the minima of @xmath6 are reached when the particle passes the peak ( or bottom ) of the perturbation potential , whereas the maxima generally occur at the times the particle enters or exits the perturbation region .",
    "we have also demonstrated that while the observed non - monotonicity of the le decay is generic in one - dimensional systems the short - time decay can be monotonous in systems with higher number of dimensions .    secondly , using the tga we have analyzed the envelope decay of the le and shown it to be well approximated by a gaussian , @xmath246 $ ] .",
    "the decay time @xmath20 is expressible in terms of parameters of the initial state , system s hamiltonian , and perturbation potential .",

    "( [ tau_ring ] ) , and a particle inside a smooth potential well of an arbitrary shape , eq .",
    "( [ tau_well ] ) .",
    "the analytical formulas have been given convincing numerical support .",
    "all results presented in this paper pertain to the short - time decay of the le in `` clean '' quantum systems and assume no averaging over initial states or hamiltonian perturbations . in this respect",
    ", the findings may prove valuable in echo experiments which imply no or minimal averaging intrinsically .",
    "thus , for example , in echo experiments with ultra - cold atoms one could try to use an experimentally observed decay function @xmath6 to reconstruct the localized perturbation potential .",

    "the celebrated thawed gaussian approximation ( tga ) , originally introduced by heller @xcite , is a semiclassical technique for propagation of localized gaussian wave packets in time without having to solve the full schrdinger equation .",
    "the approximation is based on the idea that , at least for short times , the expectation values of the position and momentum operators , @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , evolve according to the classical , hamilton equations of motion .",
