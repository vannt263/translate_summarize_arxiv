    "this theorem states that the ground state wavefunctions of bosons under very general conditions are positive definite , which is essentially a direct result of the perron - frobenius theorem of matrix analysis @xcite .",

    "especially , the realization of so coupled bose - einstein condensations ( bec ) of @xmath2rb @xcite provides a valuable opportunity to investigate this type of exotic physics , experimentally .",

    "<S> we consider the quasi-@xmath0d two - component bose - einstein condensates with rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in a rotating trap . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation angular velocity couples to the mechanical angular momentum which contains a non - canonical part arising from so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of an external zeeman term favoring spin polarization along the radial direction is also considered , which has the same form as the non - canonical part of the mechanical angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the rotating condensate exhibits a variety of rich structures as varying the strengths of the trapping potential and interaction . with a strong trapping potential , </S>",
    "<S> the condensate exhibits a half - quantum vortex - lattice configuration . </S>",
    "<S> such a configuration is driven to the normal one by introducing the external radial zeeman field . in the case of a weak trap potential , </S>",
    "<S> the condensate exhibits a multi - domain pattern of plane - wave states under the external radial zeeman field . </S>"
