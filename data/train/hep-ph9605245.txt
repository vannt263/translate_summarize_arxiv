    "the problem of the scalar @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons has come into a central problem of hadron spectroscopy up to charm .",
    "the point is that these states posses peculiar properties in terms of the naive ( @xmath9 ) model , see e.g. the reviews @xcite . whereas , all their challenging properties can be understood @xcite in the framework of the four - quark ( @xmath10 ) mit - bag model @xcite . along with the @xmath10 nature of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 mesons the possibility of they being the @xmath0 molecules",
    "is discussed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , probably , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons are eye - witnesses of confinement @xcite .    during years of time",
    "there was established by efforts of theorists @xcite ( see also references quoted in @xcite ) that the research of the decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 could play a crucial role in the elucidation of the nature of the scalar @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .    at present , the investigation of the @xmath13 decay by detector cmd-2 is being carried out at an upgraded @xmath14-collider vepp-2 m in novosibirsk .",
    "another detector , snd , aiming to study the decays under consideration has put into the operation at the same facility . moreover , in the immediate future in frascati there is expected the start of the operation of the @xmath1 factory da@xmath15ne which , probably , makes possible studying the scalar @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons in the exhaustive way .",
    "it seems clearly that the definition of theoretical predictions prior to data securing is a natural prerequisite to clear up a mystery of the scalar mesons .    in all theoretical papers ( see @xcite and references quoted there ) except for @xcite , where the @xmath10 nature of the scalar mesons was considered , the approximation of narrow widths of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons was used for their visible widths are @xmath16 . moreover , experimenters used this approximation to give upper limits to branching ratios of the decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .    but recently @xcite there was shown that narrow resonance approximation in this instance is not valid and predictions of decay branching ratios gained in narrow resonance approximation are at least two times overstated .    in this connection",
    ", we study the scope for production of scalar molecules in the @xmath1 radiative decays beyond the narrow resonance width approximation .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the formulae needed for our investigation and discuss corrections for finite widths to propagators of scalar mesons .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the model of the @xmath19 transition amplitude . in section 3.a",
    "we state ( more precise , make clear ) the model of the production of the scalar @xmath0 molecules in the @xmath1 radiative decays . in section 3.b",
    "we calculate in the analytical form the imaginary part of the @xmath19 transition amplitude that gives near 90% of the branching ratios in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels . in section",
    "3.c the real part of the @xmath19 transition amplitude , dominating in the @xmath0 channels , is derived partly in the analytic form partly in the integral one suitable for the simulation of the experimental data .    in section 4",
    "we give the numerical results of our analysis .",
    "we found that in the case of the molecule nature of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonances @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the mass spectra for the @xmath24 are presented .",
    "the phase of the scalar resonance production amplitude , causing the interference patterns in the reaction @xmath6 in the @xmath1 meson mass region , is calculated .",
    "section 5 reviews our results and discusses experimental perspectives .",
    "let us introduce the amplitudes @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are polarization three - vectors of the @xmath1-meson and the @xmath28-quantum in the @xmath1-meson rest frame , @xmath29 is an invariant mass of two pseudoscalar mesons @xmath30 and @xmath31 produced in the @xmath32 decay .    in @xmath14 collisions",
    "the @xmath1-meson is produced transversely polarized relative to the beam axis in the center mass system .",
    "that is why the amplitudes from eq .",
    "( 1 ) lead to the angular distribution @xmath33 if one is not interested in a polarization of the @xmath28-quantum in the reaction @xmath34 . in eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath35 is the angle between the momentum of the @xmath28-quantum and the axis of the beams .    according to the gauge invariance condition ,",
    "the decay amplitudes are proportional to the electromagnetic ( electric ) field , that is the photon energy ( @xmath36 ) in a low energy region : @xmath37 if @xmath38    the decay width in narrow scalar resonance width approximation @xmath39 the physically measurable partial widths @xmath40 for @xmath41 .    for @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a propagator of a scalar meson .",
    "the width of the decay of the scalar meson @xmath45 into two pseudoscalar meson state @xmath46 with an invariant mass @xmath29 is @xmath47 the final particle identity in the @xmath48 case is taken into account in the determination of @xmath49 .    in eq .",
    "( 6 ) it is well to bear in mind isotopic symmetry @xmath50 the use of narrow scalar resonance width approximation in the case under consideration is not valid for two reasons@xcite .    the first and major reason is connected with soft ( according strong interaction standards ) photons . from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) it follows that the right slope of the resonance is suppressed at least by the factor @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the resonance mass . as was shown @xcite it leads to the suppressions of the integral contribution from the right slope of the resonance at least by a factor of five for the decays into @xmath54 channels and at least by a factor of fifty for the decays into the @xmath55 channels .",
    "so , the physically measurable widths eq .",
    "( 5 ) are caused practically fully by `` a half '' of resonance , that is by its left slope in the channels @xmath20 and @xmath56 . only for this reason the results ( @xmath57 ) obtained in narrow width approximation",
    "are overstated two times .    the second reason is connected with finite width correction in propagators of the scalar mesons .",
    "let us take the generally accepted breit - wigner formulae .    if @xmath58  , @xmath59 if @xmath60  , @xmath61 when @xmath62  , @xmath63 where the width of the decay of the scalar @xmath45 resonance into the @xmath56 or @xmath20 channels @xmath64 is determined with eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "since the scalar resonances lie under the @xmath0 thresholds the position of the peak in the cross section or in the mass spectrum does not coincide with @xmath65 as is easy to see using eqs .",
    "( 9)(11 ) .",
    "that is why it is necessary to renormalize the mass in the breit - wigner formulae , eqs .",
    "( 9)(11 ) , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the physical mass squared ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) while @xmath70 is the bare mass squared .",
    "so , the physical mass is heavier than the bare one .",
    "this circumstance is especially important in the case of a strong coupling of the scalar mesons with the @xmath0 channels as in the four - quark and molecule models .",
    "meanwhile it was not taken into account both in fitting of data and theoretical works excluding the papers @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that eqs .",
    "( 9)(11 ) are applied only in a resonance region .",
    "they , for example , have incorrect analytic properties at @xmath71 .",
    "the expressions , in which this defect is removed , can be found in @xcite .",
    "notice that when the scalar resonances lie between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 thresholds it is necessary to renormalize the mass in the breit - wigner formulae in the following manner @xmath74 the coupling constants in the molecule model @xcite : @xmath75 notice that in this model @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "unfortunately , at present it is not possible to construct the truly relativistic gauge invariant model in the case of a @xmath0 scalar molecule production in the @xmath1 radiative decays for the nonrelativistic nature of a wave function of a molecule .",
    "but it is possible to `` relativize '' a model constructed in the @xmath0 molecule rest frame and to place a gauge invariance constraint .    in the rest frame of a scalar @xmath0 molecule we consider the production mechanism described by the diagrams in fig.1 , where the cross in the @xmath78 vertex points to a coupling of the @xmath72 state with a extended meson .    in the scalar molecule rest frame , @xmath79 , the decay amplitude @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are four - momenta of the @xmath1 meson and the photon respectively .",

    "( 15)(18 ) reproduce the well definite gauge invariant field theory expression @xcite .",
    "our model is the practically same one as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that in eqs .",
    "( 4.21)(4.23 ) of the paper @xcite the function @xmath84 is used to describe a momentum distribution of a @xmath85 meson in a molecule whereas a @xmath85 meson has the three - momentum equal @xmath96 .",
