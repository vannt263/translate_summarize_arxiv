    "an rna structure is the helical configuration of an rna sequence , described by its primary sequence of nucleotides * a * , * g * , * u * and * c * together with the watson - crick ( * a - u * , *",
    "g - c * ) and ( * u - g * ) base pairing rules .",
    "subject to these single stranded rna form helical structures .",
    "since the function of many rna sequences is oftentimes tantamount to their structures , it is of central importance to understand rna structure in the context of studying the function of biological rna , as well as in the design process of artificial rna . in the following we use a coarse grained notion of structure by concentrating on the pairs of nucleotide positions corresponding to the chemical bonds and ignoring any spatial embedding .",
    "there are several ways to represent these rna structures @xcite .",
    "we choose the diagram representation @xcite which is particularly well suited for displaying the crossings of the watson - crick base pairs .",
    "a diagram is a labeled graph over the vertex set @xmath7=\\{1 , \\dots , n\\}$ ] with degree @xmath8 , represented by drawing its vertices @xmath9 in a horizontal line and its arcs @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , in the upper half - plane .",
    "the vertices and arcs correspond to nucleotides and watson - crick ( * a - u * , * g - c * ) and ( * u - g * ) base pairs , respectively . we categorize diagrams according to the @xmath1 parameters @xmath12 : the maximum number of mutually crossing arcs , @xmath13 , the minimum arc - length , @xmath14 and the minimum stack - length , @xmath15 . here",
    "the length of an arc @xmath10 is @xmath16 and a stack of length @xmath15 is a sequence of `` parallel '' arcs of the form @xmath17 , see figure  [ f : lego1 ] .",
    "we call an arc of length @xmath14 a @xmath14-arc .    in the following we call a @xmath0-noncrossing diagram with arc - length @xmath3 and stack - length @xmath18 a @xmath0-noncrossing rna structure ( of type @xmath19 ) .",
    "we denote the set ( number ) of @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures of type @xmath19 by @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and refer to @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures for @xmath22 as pseudoknot rna structures .",
    "intuitively , a higher number of pairwise crossing arcs is tantamount to higher structural complexity and crossing bonds are reality @xcite .",
    "these pseudoknot bonds @xcite occur in functional rna ( rnasep @xcite ) , ribosomal rna @xcite and are conserved in the catalytic core of group i introns , see figure  [ f : lego0 ] , where we show the diagram representation of the catalytic core region of the group i self - splicing intron @xcite .",
    "for @xmath23 we have rna structures with no @xmath24 crossing arcs , i.e.  the well - known rna secondary structures , whose combinatorics was pioneered by waterman _ et.al .",
    "rna secondary structures are structures of type @xmath25 .",
    "there are many reasons why pseudoknot structures are fascinating .",
    "first , compared to secondary structures their `` mathematical '' properties are much more intriguing @xcite .",
    "their enumeration employs the nontrivial concepts of vacillating tableaux @xcite and singular expansions @xcite .",
    "secondly , the recurrence relation for the numbers of @xmath1-noncrossing rna @xcite is , in contrast to that for secondary structures , `` enumerative '' but not `` constructive '' .",
    "this indicates that prediction of pseudoknot rna is much more involved compared to the dynamic programming routine used for secondary structures .",
    "nevertheless , there exist several prediction algorithms for rna pseudoknot structures @xcite which are able to express certain `` types '' of pseudoknots . in this context",
    "the notion of the `` language of rna '' has been tossed @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial analysis in @xcite shows that @xmath1-noncrossing rna structures ( @xmath26 ) exhibit an exponential growth rate of @xmath27 and even when considering only structures with minimum arc - length @xmath1 the rate is @xmath28 .",
    "this is bad news , since this rate exceeds already for @xmath29 the number of sequences over the natural alphabet .",
    "therefore , _ a priori _ , not all @xmath1-noncrossing structures can be folded by sequences .",
    "the situation becomes worse for higher @xmath0 : the results of @xcite imply the following exponential growth rates for @xmath0-noncrossing rna structures denotes the dominant real singularity of the generating function ]       the first assertion follows from lemma  [ l : core ] and eq .",
    "( [ e : moebius ] ) , which allows to express the terms @xmath30 via @xmath31 .",
    "in order to prove eq .",
    "( [ e : growth-2 ] ) we apply lemma  [ l : www ] twice .",
    "first , lemma  [ l : www ] implies for arbitrary @xmath15 and @xmath32 @xmath33 and secondly , it guarantees for arbitrary @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36 the key observation ( the `` bridge '' ) is here the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath37 via the terms @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is clear that for any @xmath40 there exists an unique solution @xmath41 for @xmath42 given by @xmath43 .",
    "this allows to express @xmath44 for any @xmath15 via the bivariate generating function @xmath45 .",
    "now we employ lemma  [ l : arc-2 ] , which provides an interpretation of the latter as follows : @xmath46 we accordingly obtain @xmath47 and eq .",
    "( [ e : f1 ] ) follows .",
    "we set @xmath48 .",
    "+ _ claim . _",
    "all dominant singularities of @xmath49 are singularities of @xmath50 and in particular @xmath51 is a dominant singularity .",
    "+ to prove the claim we observe that a dominant singularity of @xmath52 is either a singularity of @xmath50 or @xmath53 .",
    "suppose there exists some singularity @xmath54 which is a root of @xmath53 . by construction @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "is necessarily a singularity of @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath57 , then we arrive at the contradiction @xmath58 since @xmath59 is not finite and @xmath60 therefore all dominant singularities of @xmath61 are singularities of @xmath50 . by pringsheim s theorem  @xcite , @xmath49 has a dominant positive real singularity which by construction equals @xmath51 and the claim follows .",
    "+ the equation @xmath62 has a minimal positive real solution and the claim implies that its inverse equals the exponential growth - rate .",
    "according to @xcite the power series @xmath63 has an analytic continuation in a @xmath64-domain and we have @xmath65v(z)\\sim k \\varphi_k(n ) ( \\rho^{-1})^n$ ] , where @xmath66 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e : f - k - imp ] ) . in view of eq .",
    "( [ e : f1 ] ) we can therefore employ theorem  [ t : transfer ] , which allows us to transfer the subexponential factors from the asymptotic expressions for @xmath67 to @xmath68 , whence eq .",
