    "the range of possible neutron star masses depends on many factors , such as the initial mass of the progenitor s stellar core , the details of the explosion ( in particular mass accretion as the explosion develops ) , subsequent mass accretion from a binary companion , and the pressure - density relation , or equation of state ( eos ) , of the neutron star matter . on the low - mass end , producing a neutron star requires the progenitor s core to exceed the chandrasekhar mass , which depends on the uncertain electron fraction .",
    "theoretical models place this minimum mass in the range @xmath10    1.3@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the largest possible neutron star mass depends on the unknown physics determining the eos  for example whether kaon condensates or strange matter can from in the interior ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the highest - mass neutron star to - date with an accurate measurement weighs in at @xmath11 @xcite , which already rules out the presence of exotic hadronic matter at the nuclear saturation density @xcite .    testing the predictions of supernova models , binary evolution models , and finding objects at the extremes of the mass spectrum require determining neutron star masses in a variety of systems with differing progenitor masses and evolutionary history .",
    "neutron stars accompanying either a high - mass star or another neutron star are thought to have accreted little to no matter over their lifetimes .",
    "in contrast , neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries and millisecond pulsars , typically in close orbits around a white dwarf , have undergone extended accretion periods that will make the current mass exceed that at birth .",
    "different types of binaries will also have different average neutron star progenitor masses .",
    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )  binaries containing a neutron star and a massive ( @xmath12m@xmath13 ) companion  are particularly interesting systems in which to pursue mass measurements . in most cases",
    "the neutron star progenitor will have been more massive than the observed donor star , yielding a relatively high - mass pre - supernova core .",
    "furthermore , the ns mass will be close to the birth mass , since even for eddington rates @xmath14 can be accreted in the @xmath15yr lifetime of the ob companion .",
    "indeed , among the five hmxb with reasonably secure masses , one ( vela x-1 ) has @xmath16@xmath5  @xcite , indicating that this neutron star may have been born heavy .",
    "determining ns masses in hmxbs is , however , difficult . in compact object binaries ( ns ",
    "white dwarf ) , highly precise mass measurements can be obtained from relativistic effects like the precession of periastron @xcite or measurement of the shapiro delay  @xcite . in hxmbs , however , accurate mass measurements are limited to eclipsing systems where orbital parameters for both the ns and its stellar companion can be measured . for the ns",
    "this is done through x - ray or radio pulse timing , and for the companion through radial ",
    "velocity measurements derived from doppler shifts in the stellar lines . in the event pulsations are not detected , the ns mass can still be determined if good spectra are available to estimate the mass of the optical component . in rare cases where the distance to the binary is known , this provides an independent constraint on the physical scale of the system  for example by calculating the absolute magnitude of the components .",
    "however , calculating masses from such constraints is model - dependent .    in this paper",

    "if mass is being accreted onto an object in a spherically symmetric manner , the accretion rate is limited by the eddington rate , @xmath137 and the peak luminosity is @xmath138 . for a 1.52.5@xmath5  compact object , @xmath139 . at its brightest ,",
    "the source luminosity in the 0.24.5kev band was @xmath140  about @xmath141 .",

    "such high luminosity sustained over significant parts of the orbit is not observed in wind - fed systems , which have typical luminosities an order of magnitude smaller .",

    "we find that the basic application of our method is over  estimating the mass ( table  [ tab : compare ] ) .",
    "part of this discrepancy is likely related to equating the roche volume radius to the effective photometric radius ( equation  [ eq : pdf ] ) . the roche volume radius ( equation  [ eq : rla ] ) is the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the roche lobe of the star .",
    "the effective photometric radius ( equation  [ eq : rt ] ) is the radius of a sphere with the same surface area as the star .",
    "since an ellipsoid has a larger surface area than a sphere of the same volume , the actual roche volume radius will be smaller than the effective photometric radius .",
    "using a larger radius for the roche lobe increases the masses of both the components in the binary .    putting it another way ,",

    "thus while this method has potential , more detailed modeling of the primary is clearly required to accurately infer component masses .",
