    "quantum degenerate mixtures of bosons and fermions provide interesting playgrounds where effects of quantum statistics become explicit .",
    "several experiments on the boson - fermion mixtures have been performed , first on the classic example of the @xmath1he-@xmath2he mixture  @xcite and more recently in cold atomic gases such as @xmath10li-@xmath11li  @xcite , @xmath10li-@xmath12na  @xcite , @xmath13k-@xmath14rb  @xcite , and metastable triplet @xmath1he@xmath15-@xmath2he@xmath15 mixtures  @xcite .",
    "molecular condensates , formed through the bcs - bec crossover , provide another possibility for the boson - fermion mixtures  @xcite . stimulated by experiments , theoretical studies of the boson - fermion mixtures predict new phenomena such as phase separation between fermi gas and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite or sympathetic cooling of fermi gas by the superfluidity of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the bound states of fermions on a superfluid vortex .",
    "superfluid vortices were realized by the recent experiment in cold fermi gas throughout the bcs and bec regimes  @xcite .",
    "the problem has been considered in the literature  @xcite , with most of the treatments following the original approach by caroli , de  gennes , and matricon  @xcite ( or the more rigorous approach based on the bogoliubov  de  gennes equation  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for us to revisit the problem is that the caroli  de  gennes  matricon formalism is expected to work well only in the bcs regime where there exist well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "its application to the bec regime where two fermions form a bound molecule would require an exceedingly large number of mean - field quasiparticle states for an accurate description of the strongly bound molecules",
    ". it also can not be applied to the important case of the @xmath1he-@xmath2he mixture .",
    "we are interested in the case when the minimum of the fermion dispersion curve @xmath16 sits at zero momentum : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is positive and quartic and higher order corrections are negligible .",
    "this case is opposite to the situation in the bcs theory , where the minimum is near the fermi momentum , but it holds for the solution of @xmath1he in @xmath2he and also for cold atom gases sufficiently deep in the bec regime .",
    "our technique relies on the use of an effective field theory .",
    "the effective field theory formalism is especially powerful in strongly coupled systems where perturbative methods are not applicable . in our cases the details of the interactions",
    "become unimportant , as they are encoded into a few low - energy parameters .",
    "thus the theory developed in this paper is universal and can be applied to many different physical systems .    in writing down the effective field theory , we put special emphasis on the galilean invariance  @xcite .",
    "the galilean invariance as well as the global symmetries of the system considerably restrict the possible form of the effective lagrangian .",
    "we show that coupling constants appearing in the effective field theory can be expressed through the effective fermion mass and the derivative of fermion energy gap with the chemical potential .",
    "the latter is directly related to the bardeen - baym - pines ( bbp ) parameter .",
    "both the effective fermion mass and the bbp parameter have been measured by experiments for the @xmath1he-@xmath2he mixture .",
    "after the construction of the effective field theory , we use it to the study of bound fermion states on a vortex of the boson superfluid .",
    "we derive a simple criterion which tells us at which values of the angular momentum @xmath0 there are an infinite number of bound energy levels .",
    "we will apply our effective field theory to two boson - fermion mixed systems , a dilute solution of @xmath1he in @xmath2he superfluid in sec .",
    "[ sec : he ] and the bec regime of the cold polarized fermi gas in sec .",
    "[ sec : fermi_gas ] , in order to predict possible angular momenta for bound fermion states .",
    "here we demonstrate how to construct an effective field theory of dilute fermions in a boson superfluid in accordance with the galilean invariance and global symmetries .",
    "since the microscopic theory is galilean invariant , its low - energy effective lagrangian should satisfy the following identity required by the galilean invariance : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the momentum density , @xmath21 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath22 is the particle number current @xcite . if there are more than one species of particles in the system , the right hand side of the equation is a sum over all species .",
    "this identity simply indicates that the momentum density should be equal to the mass carried by the particle number current in the galilean invariant system .",
    "the galilean invariance as well as the global symmetries of the system considerably restrict the possible form of the effective lagrangian .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the particular case of the dilute solution of @xmath23 in the @xmath24 superfluid from now on .",
    "however , the universality of the effective field theory means that our discussion , with only minimal modifications , will be applicable to any other dilute fermion excitations in a boson superfluid .      first of all , let us consider an effective field theory for the pure @xmath2he superfluid . the physical degree of freedom at long distance is the phase of the condensate @xmath25 , which is defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 being a field for the @xmath2he atoms . under the u(1 )",
    "symmetry associated with the number conservation of @xmath2he atoms , the field @xmath25 transforms as @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the effective lagrangian of the @xmath2he superfluid obeying this symmetry should be a function of derivatives of the field @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we note that terms where derivatives act more than once on one field such as @xmath31 or @xmath32 are also possible .",
    "however , they are in higher orders in the power counting scheme where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are regarded as order @xmath33 . in consideration of the rotational symmetry , the leading order effective lagrangian @xmath34 should be written by a polynomial of @xmath29 and @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36    now we impose the galilean invariance @xmath37 on the effective lagrangian , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass and the number current of the @xmath2he atoms .",
    "since the momentum density and the particle number current are given by @xmath40 the galilean invariance @xmath37 results in @xmath41 this equality requires that the effective lagrangian depends on the field @xmath25 only through the combination @xmath42 as follows : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is an arbitrary polynomial , which will be identified to the pressure of the pure @xmath2he superfluid as a function of the chemical potential later .    in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the symmetry @xmath28 is spontaneously broken . at finite chemical potential @xmath45 , the ground state of the superfluid system corresponds to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "then we expand the field around the ground state as @xmath47 , where fluctuations of @xmath48 around zero corresponds to superfluid phonon excitations .",

    "( [ eq : l4_theta ] ) results in @xmath50 now we can show that the function @xmath44 is identical to the pressure as a function of @xmath45 at zero temperature up to an irrelevant constant .",
    "for that purpose , we calculate the number density of @xmath2he atoms @xmath51 by differentiate the lagrangian with @xmath45 and we obtain @xmath52 this equation implies that @xmath8 is a function of the chemical potential satisfying @xmath53 , which means that @xmath54 is identical to the thermodynamic pressure up to an irrelevant constant .",
    "once equation of state of the @xmath2he superfluid @xmath54 is given as a function of the chemical potential , the low - energy effective field theory of superfluid phonons is simply given by replacing @xmath45 with @xmath55 .    in order to proceed our analysis further , we expand eq .",

    "next , we consider the coupling between the superfluid phonon @xmath48 and a @xmath1he atom @xmath58 .",

    "we note that there is an energy cost to introduce a single @xmath1he atom into the @xmath2he superfluid .",
    "this energy is some function @xmath59 of the @xmath2he chemical potential @xmath45 .",
    "however , galilean invariance tells us that @xmath45 always enters the lagrangian in the combination @xmath55 .",

    "the second term proportional to @xmath61 gives a galilean invariant coupling between the superfluid phonon and the @xmath1he atom put into the @xmath2he superfluid .",
    "however , this is not the only coupling between @xmath1he and @xmath2he , as we shall see below .",
    "now , let us consider the kinetic term of the @xmath1he field @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath1he atom put into the @xmath2he superfluid has the effective mass @xmath62 , not equal to the bare mass @xmath63 due to the strong interaction with the @xmath2he superfluid .",
    "thus the kinetic term of the @xmath1he atom is @xmath64 with @xmath65 being the chemical potential for the @xmath1he atom .",
    "however , this lagrangian does not satisfy the galilean invariance @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number current of the @xmath1he atom .",
    "this is because the galilean invariance condition involves the bare mass , while the kinetic term in the lagrangian involves the effective mass .",
    "the resolution to this apparent paradox is that there are interaction terms that contribute to both the momentum density and the particle number current in order to restore the galilean invariance .",
    "therefore , the galilean invariance imposes some relationships between the interaction terms and the @xmath1he effective mass .",
    "this situation here is reminiscent of the fermi liquid theory , where there exists a relationship between an effective fermion mass and a landau parameter .",
    "one way to construct the lagrangian that obeys the galilean invariance is as follows @xcite .",
    "the effective mass of @xmath1he atom @xmath62 originates in the fact that the @xmath1he quasiparticle in the @xmath2he superfluid entrains superfluid @xmath2he atoms due to the strong interaction between them .",
    "therefore , an elementary excitation of the system , or the @xmath1he quasiparticle @xmath68 , should be written as @xmath69 . here",
