    "in @xcite and @xcite we presented new evidence for a smaller fine structure constant , @xmath5 , in high redshift quasar absorption clouds : @xmath6 .",
    "this preliminary result is the weighted mean from a many - multiplet ( mm ) analysis of 128 absorption systems and represents a significant improvement on our previously published result from 49 systems @xcite : @xmath7 .",
    "such a potentially fundamental result requires extreme scrutiny , including a thorough consideration of possible systematic errors . in @xcite",
    "we explored a wide range of possibilities : laboratory wavelength errors , wavelength calibration errors , atmospheric dispersion effects , unidentified interloping transitions , isotopic ratio and/or hyperfine structure effects , intrinsic instrumental profile variations , spectrograph temperature variations , heliocentric velocity corrections , kinematic effects and large scale magnetic fields .",
    "all but two of these  atmospheric dispersion effects and isotopic abundance variation  were shown to be negligible .    here",
    "we present an updated analysis of these two effects .",
    "we also present new results from a line removal test which constrains systematic errors associated with individual transitions or species .",
    "[ fig : syserr]a illustrates how atmospheric dispersion results in an angular separation between different wavelengths as they enter the spectrograph slit",
    ". this separation increases with increasing zenith angle , @xmath8 . for",
    "the particular optical design of the keck / hires , the component of angular separation across the slit ( i.e. in the wavelength direction as projected from the ccd ) will cause a _ compression _ of the quasar spectrum .",
    "such a compression will mimic @xmath9 for the mg / feii systems observed at @xmath10 , the effect being complicated at high-@xmath11 by the diversity of @xmath12 coefficients coefficient measures the sensitivity of a transition wavelength to changes in @xmath1 .",
    "see @xcite for details and updated values . ]",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]a ) .",
    "a wavelength dependent asymmetry will also be introduced into the instrumental profile ( ip ) due to truncation of the seeing discs by the slit edges .",
    "these effects will not be applied to the thorium - argon ( thar ) calibration spectra since the thar lamp illuminates the slit uniformly in all cases .",
    "an image rotator is usually employed to hold the slit axis perpendicular to the horizon as the quasar is tracked across the sky .",
    "this eliminates the compression and ip asymmetry effects .",
    "only 51 of our 128 absorption systems were observed in this way ; 77 systems were observed before august 1996 when keck / hires was fitted with an image rotator .",
    "however , the values of @xmath4 for the 77 affected and 51 unaffected systems are consistent , with weighted mean values @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . we also expect to observe a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath8 , especially for the low-@xmath11 mg / feii systems ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]a ) .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in the simulations below .",
    "however , no such correlation is observed in our quasar data .",
    "therefore , the data themselves suggest a negligible effect on @xmath4 due to atmospheric dispersion effects .",
    "nevertheless , we used the atmospheric and telescope parameters for each quasar observation to model the potential effect of atmospheric dispersion on @xmath4 .",
    "the angular separation of two wavelengths entering the slit is determined by the refractive index of air at the telescope ( which depends on temperature , pressure and relative humidity ) .",
    "the slit angle with respect to the vertical , @xmath15 , is equal to @xmath8 for the pre - rotator keck / hires .",
    "we applied the resulting wavelength shifts to a high s / n simulation of our data and determined @xmath4 , giving a correction which we apply to the values measured from the quasar spectra .",
    "we compare the corrected values of @xmath4 with the uncorrected values in fig .",
    "[ fig : syserr]c .",
    "overall , our model of atmospheric dispersion has an opposite effect on the low-@xmath11 systems compared to the high-@xmath11 systems : it can not explain the observed deviation from @xmath16 .",
    "once we apply the correction , the apparent evolution of @xmath1 with look - back time is enhanced .",
    "mg , si , cr , fe , ni and zn have several stable isotopes and so the transitions used in the mm method will have unresolved isotopic structure .",
    "however , only the isotopic structures of the mg lines have been determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the mg and si transitions involve similar energy levels and so , in @xcite , we estimated their isotopic structure by scaling the mgii @xmath172796 structure by the mass isotopic shift .",
    "we fitted the mg and si absorption lines with these isotopic structures using the terrestrial values of the isotopic abundances @xcite",
    ". however , galactic observations of mg @xcite and theoretical models of si @xcite in stars strongly suggest that only the @xmath18 mg and @xmath19si isotopes will exist in quasar absorption clouds with significant abundances . fig .",
    "[ fig : syserr]b illustrates the effect this would have on a measured mgi @xmath172852 absorption line position ( the isotopic separations are exaggerated by a factor of 25 ) .    to obtain an upper limit on the effect of isotopic ratio evolution on @xmath4 , we refit the mg and si transitions using only the @xmath18 mg and @xmath19si isotopes , i.e. zero abundances of @xmath20 mg and @xmath21si in the absorption clouds .",
    "we compare these new , corrected values of @xmath4 with the uncorrected values in fig .",
    "[ fig : syserr]c ( middle panel ) .",
    "as expected , the potential effect is most prominent in the low-@xmath11 mg / feii systems .",
    "note that @xmath4 is more negative after the correction : isotopic ratio evolution can not explain our results .",
    "although the isotopic structures of the other transitions in our analysis are not known , they should be more compact since the mass isotopic shift is inversely proportional to the square of atomic mass .",
    "the line removal test described below largely rules out such strong effects .",
    "a non - zero @xmath4 manifests itself as a distinct pattern of line shifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]a ) .",
    "thus , with a large set of fitted transitions , one or more transitions can be removed from a given system and @xmath4 will remain well - constrained . in the absence of systematic errors associated with the transition removed or with the wavelength scale of the quasar spectra , @xmath4 should not change systematically for all systems .",
    "for example , removing a single transition ( e.g. mgii @xmath172796 ) from our fits to the quasar data directly probes possible systematic errors due to line blending , isotopic / hyperfine structure effects and errors in the laboratory wavelengths .",
    "removing entire species ( e.g. all transitions of siii ) also tests for isotopic / hyperfine structure effects .",
    "given a set of fitted transitions , we only remove transitions that _ can _ be removed . to clarify this , consider removing mgii @xmath172796 ( fig . [",
    "fig : rmline]b ) . for the low-@xmath11 mg / feii systems , a well - constrained value of @xmath4 can only be obtained when at least one mg line is fitted since the difference between the @xmath12 coefficients for the various feii transitions is small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]a ) . if the only available anchor line is mgii @xmath172796 then we can not remove it from the system .",
    "similarly , we only remove the entire mgii species if the mgi @xmath172852 line is fitted .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]c we present line removal results for all transitions and species .",
    "the left panel shows the overall effect line removal has on the @xmath22 systems where line removal is possible ( cf .",
    "upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]b ) .",
    "the right panel shows the effect on the entire sample ( cf .",
    "lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]b ) .",
    "we see no evidence for systematic errors associated with particular transitions or species .",
    "we have extended our previous analysis of systematic errors @xcite to include the new , significantly augmented sample of 128 absorption systems outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we can not explain the observed value of @xmath23 with known systematic errors .",
    "here we have outlined our analysis of the two most important of these : atmospheric dispersion effects and possible isotopic ratio evolution .",
    "the former is an instrumental effect that should have affected 77 of the 128 absorption systems .",
    "however , the data themselves suggest that atmospheric dispersion had a negligible effect on @xmath4 . furthermore",
    ", modelling indicates that the resulting low - order distortion of the wavelength scale should have shifted the low- and high-@xmath11 values of @xmath4 in opposite senses , clearly at odds with our observations .",
    "an upper limit on the effect on @xmath4 of strong isotopic ratio evolution was obtained by assuming zero isotopic abundances for @xmath20 mg and @xmath21si in the quasar absorption clouds .",
    "although the isotopic structures of the other transitions used in the mm method are not known , strong isotopic ratio evolution for these elements is strongly constrained by the line removal test ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rmline]c ) .",
    "all 128 absorption systems were observed with the keck / hires .",
    "although we have ruled out many instrumental systematic errors , independent measurements of @xmath4 must be carried out with a different telescope and spectrograph .",
    "using the mm method to analyse vlt and subaru spectra will be a crucial check on possible systematic errors ."
