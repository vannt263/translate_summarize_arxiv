    "the best estimate for the masses of glueballs comes from lattice gauge theory calculations , which in the quenched approximation show @xcite that the lightest glueball has @xmath0 and that its mass should be in the range @xmath6 gev .",
    "while the lattice remains immature for predicting glueball decays , amsler and close @xcite first pointed out that in lattice inspired models , such as the flux tube @xcite , glueballs will mix strongly with nearby @xmath7 states with the same @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "recent studies on coarse - grained lattices appear to confirm that there is indeed significant mixing between @xmath9 and @xmath1 together with associated mass shifts , at least in the @xmath8  =  @xmath10 sector  @xcite .",
    "if these results survive at finer lattice spacing , the conclusion will be that glueball - flavour mixing is a controlling feature of the phenomena in the @xmath11 gev mass region of meson spectroscopy .",
    "it is our purpose in the present paper to build a phenomenological interpretation of the data based on intuition from lattice qcd , and to identify the data needed to confirm it .    to help orient readers",
    ", we first present an overview of the paper and its central conclusions .",
    "the first analyses of @xmath12 mixing used the mass matrix with an assumed @xmath12 mixing strength @xcite .",
    "such a mixing between a glueball and a @xmath1 nonet will lead to three isoscalar states of the same @xmath8 .",
    "motivated by lattice qcd , these analyses focussed on the physical states in the glueball mass region - the @xmath3 and @xmath13 and either predicted the existence of a further @xmath14 state around 1700 mev @xcite or assumed that the @xmath15 was that state @xcite .",
    "the existence of this scalar meson is now experimentally verified  @xcite .",
    "these papers differed in what they assumed for the mass of the bare glueball relative to the @xmath16 , which led to some quantitative differences in output .",
    "nonetheless , while these papers at first sight differed in detail , their conclusions share some common robust features . in particular , the flavour content of the states is predicted to have the @xmath17 and @xmath18 in phase ( su(3 ) singlet tendency ) for the @xmath3 and @xmath19 , and out of phase ( octet tendency ) for the @xmath13 . in section 2",
    "we review these papers and show why their outputs are similar .",
    "in particular these similarities highlight that further constraints are needed if we are to establish whether the bare glueball is at the upper @xcite or lower @xcite end of the @xmath20 gev range favoured by quenched lattice qcd , or even whether the glueball is required  @xcite .",
    "there are now extensive data on the production and decay @xcite of the above states .",
    "these provide further constraints on the @xmath12 content .",
    "theoretical analysis of decays is under better control than production and so we shall discuss the implications of decays first ( section 3 ) .",
    "the wa102 collaboration has published  @xcite , for the first time in a single experiment , a complete data set for the decay branching ratios of the @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath19 to all pseudoscalar meson pairs .",
    "@xcite and a preliminary letter by us  @xcite have examined the flavour dependence of scalar meson decay and how these data constrain the flavour and glue mixing of these scalar states .",
    "the results here too agree with the generic structure found in the mass mixing analyses of section 2 .",
    "we identify why this is so and assess the implications . a result that is more general than any specific mixing scheme is that no pair out of the three @xmath21 can be in the same pure @xmath1 nonet ; other degrees of freedom",
    "are required .",
    "we shall see that the results are robust .",
    "they confirm lattice results that @xmath12 mixing is ( nearly ) flavour blind and suggest that the preferred glueball mass falls into the mass range , @xmath22 .",
    "then ( section 3.2 ) we will investigate the stability against flavour symmetry breaking . from these results",
    "we shall identify a systematic correlation between glueball mass , mixing , and flavour symmetry breaking . to choose among these results requires further experimental tests that can determine the dynamics of a glueball in this mass region .",
    "this brings us to section 5 and production dynamics .",
    "production by @xmath23 is potentially the cleanest as this probes the    @xmath1 flavours and phases .",
    "we advocate serious study of @xmath24 as the sharpest arbiter of the wavefunctions , but we also warn against overly naive interpretation of @xmath23 couplings in the @xmath10 sector .",
    "the angular and kinematic dependence of @xmath25 also shows distinct differences among the various mesons , but the dynamical origin of this is still obscure .",
    "we note a possible systematic pattern that correlates the @xmath9 and flavour mixing in our solutions with the distributions observed in central production .",
    "further ways of separating the @xmath12 content in the @xmath10 sector are proposed .",
    "ideally @xmath23 couplings can disentangle the amplitudes and this can then be used to decode the dynamics of central production .",

    "the detailed assumptions of the two approaches differed but the outputs were remarkably similar in certain features .",
    "we shall first illustrate why this similarity occurs , abstract its general features and then propose further tests of the general hypothesis .    in the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 basis ,",

    "this would appear to be quite different to the above , but if for illustration we adopt @xmath81 , the resulting mixing amplitudes are    @xmath82    it is immediately apparent that the solutions for the lowest mass state in the two schemes are similar , as are the relative phases throughout and also the qualitative importance of the @xmath9 component in the high mass state .",
    "both solutions exhibit destructive interference between the @xmath63 and @xmath65 flavours for the middle state .",
    "this parallelism is not a coincidence .",
    "the essential dynamical assumption of ref .",
    "@xcite and here is that the basic @xmath12 coupling is ( nearly ) flavour symmetric .",
    "a general feature of such a three way mixing is that in the extreme limit of infinitely strong mixing the central state would tend towards flavour octet with the outer ( heaviest and lightest ) states being orthogonal mixtures of glueball and flavour singlet , namely    @xmath83    where @xmath84 . in effect , in such an extreme case the glueball would have leaked away maximally to the outer states even in the case ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the bare glueball ( zero mixing ) was in the middle of the nonet to start with .",
    "the leakage into the outer states becomes significant once the mixing strength ( off diagonal term in the mass matrix ) becomes comparable to the mass gap between glueball and @xmath1 states ( i.e. either @xmath85 or @xmath86 ) .",
    "even in the zero width approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite this tends to be the case and when one allows for the widths being of @xmath87 mev while the nonet masses and glueball mass are themselves spread over only a few hundred mev , it is apparent that there will be considerable mixing of the glueball into the @xmath1 nonet .",
    "the tendency for the @xmath1 content to separate into two constructive (  singlet tendency \" ) and one destructive (  octet tendency \" ) happens for even mild mixing ; the complete leakage of glueball from the latter is only effected as the mixing indeed tends towards infinity .",
    "if the @xmath12 coupling is flavour dependent , such that ( as above )    @xmath88    the  asymptotic maximal mixing \" solution will reflect this . specifically ( up to overall normalisation factors )    @xmath89    the pattern of @xmath63 and @xmath65 phases in equations  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , namely two constructive and one destructive , emerge so long as @xmath90 . the lattice results of ref .",
    "@xcite imply @xmath91 .",
    "it is for these reasons , _",
    "inter alia _ , that the output of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite are rather similar .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite finds opposite phases to the above and this is because their mass matrix has @xmath92 , which would correspond to the mixing being driven by octet .",
    "this differs radically from what would be expected for mixing driven by a glueball . in the flavour symmetry limit",
    ", a glueball transforms as a flavour singlet ; there is a small octet component , if the above results of lattice qcd  @xcite are a guide , but the idea that it should be orthogonal to this and dominantly octet seems bizarre .",
    "we note the mathematical consistency whereby if @xmath93 in ref .",
    "@xcite , their conclusions and results would parallel those reported here , but for the reasons just outlined , this is so far from the lattice expectation that we do not discuss it further .",
    "the sharing of the glueball intensity among the three states is driven by the proximity of the glueball to the bare states , amplified by their @xmath79 contents ( due to the factor @xmath94 relative amplitude for coupling to @xmath79 versus @xmath72 ) . apart from this",
    ", the overall qualitative pattern of phases makes it hard to distinguish among them .",
    "so the debate about whether the bare glueball lies within  @xcite or above  @xcite a prominent @xmath1 nonet may be academic unless fine measurement of the quantitative rather than simply qualitative pattern can be extracted from data .",
    "however , this robust general feature of the phase pattern enables this picture of glueball - nonet mixing to be disproved if their common implications fail empirically .    in this context",
    "we draw attention to the non - trivial implications of these dynamics for the flavour content of the @xmath13 .",
    "while there has been considerable debate about the nature of this state , there is rather general agreement empirically that the flavour content of the @xmath13 has @xmath63 and @xmath65 out of phase .",
    "it is interesting that this emerges naturally , and as a necessary consequence , for the  middle \" member when @xmath12 mixing is involved . while not a proof , this adds weight to the hypothesis that the @xmath13 is in a trio , with one partner higher and one lower in mass .",
    "conversely , had the @xmath13 not had these characteristics then this dynamics could have been eliminated .",
    "since those mass mixings were first discussed , there have emerged extensive data on the flavour - dependence of these states decays into pairs of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "analysis of these decays can be used to give measures of the flavour composition of these scalars , which bear no a priori relation to the mass mixing arguments . as such they provide an independent check on the above .",
    "we shall now examine this in section 3 .",
    "the wa102 collaboration at cern has published a complete set of decay branching ratios for the @xmath95 and @xmath19 to all kinematically allowed combinations of pairs of pseudoscalars  @xcite .",
    "these relative strengths depend upon the flavour content of the scalars .",
    "the challenge is to decode this information and to compare the resulting pattern with that deduced from the mass mixings above .",
    "we shall use the wa102 data in our primary analysis . if instead we use a world average , our conclusions are stable ( shown in section 3.1.1 ) . in order to reduce model dependence",
    ", we shall take intuition from the flux tube model  @xcite , which is based on lattice qcd .",
    "this suggests three major pathways for triggering the decays  @xcite ,    \\(i ) the direct coupling of the quarkonia component of the three states to the final pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath96 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fi:1]a ) ,    \\(ii ) the decay of @xmath97 as in fig .",

    "the @xmath13 lies very near to threshold in the @xmath100 decay mode , therefore we have used an average value of @xmath109 ( 190  mev / c ) derived from a fit to the @xmath100 mass spectrum .",

    "as can be seen it is possible to find a solution for the @xmath3 and @xmath13 for small values of @xmath112 corresponding to them having a large @xmath114 content .",
    "this is already an indication that they can not both be members of the same @xmath1 nonet unless further degrees of freedom are present .",
    "it could be that the @xmath3 belongs to a lower multiplet than the @xmath13 or that it does not exist  @xcite .",
    "even were either of these the case , there would be need for a partner to the @xmath13 with @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ fi:4 ] shows that the @xmath19 does not satisfy this .",
    "thus we can already conclude the following :    \\(i ) the @xmath116 data show that if both of these states are real , they can not be in the same @xmath1 nonet without further degrees of freedom , such as a glueball .",
    "\\(ii ) the @xmath19 data demonstrate the need to go beyond a simple @xmath51 picture at some point or that data need to change .",
    "performing an elementary su(3 ) calculation gives the reduced partial widths in table  [ ta : a2 ] , where @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 is the @xmath1 @xmath120 mixing angle of @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this mixing angle has been determined primarily from electromagnetic interactions that couple directly to the @xmath1 content of the @xmath123 states .",

    "although these relative phases appear to be stable , the relative intensities of @xmath9 and flavours differ ; the @xmath136 mev is in the lower end of the mass range preferred by some reports from lattice - qcd  @xcite , while rather lower than the preferred solution of ref .",
    "consequently the leading structure of the mixing pattern follows from degenerate perturbation theory with basis states @xmath137 . the structure of eq .",
    "[ eq : j ] , and what follows , all show this tendency .",
    "we shall discuss the implications of these results in more detail later .",
    "this conclusion following from the decay analysis appears to be stable against changes in the detailed dynamics .",

    "anisovich @xcite has argued that a signature of a glueball driven mixing will be the presence of two states that are narrow and one that is broad .",

    "the analyses of section 3 and 3.1 do have implications for the relative sizes of the total widths of the scalars for decays into pseudoscalar pairs .",
    "a consistency check on these results should take account of this ; that is the purpose of this subsection .",

    ", we note that if we allow the bare masses to be free and keep @xmath101  =  0 , then there exists a solution ( @xmath176 ) with @xmath177 , for which the mass of the bare glueball is @xmath178mev .",
    "see tables  [ ta : c4 ] and [ ta : c5 ] .",
    "the mixing matrix has the generic structure exhibited in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inflimit ] ) , modulated by the @xmath179 tending to settle into the @xmath3 and @xmath13 states .",
    "explicitly it is    @xmath180    we do not discuss this further here , other than to note that it implies that a light glueball may be compatible with data .",
    "furthermore , it is tantalising that such a result could be in accord with lattice qcd ( see for example the results with coarse lattices in ref .",
    "if such a result should emerge from future studies of qcd with fine grain lattices and including mixing then a detailed analysis of the phenomenology along the lines we have instigated here would be most interesting . we leave this as a future challenge for lattice qcd .",
    "if we then allow @xmath101 to be a free parameter we get a @xmath128 of 6.7 .",
    "the results are given in tables  [ ta : c4 ] and [ ta : c5 ] .",
    "in this case @xmath34 is tending towards @xmath36 and the solution is similar to the one we obtain in tables  [ ta : a1 ] and [ ta : a3 ] .",
    "the mixing matrix naturally shows the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inflimit ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath181 mev is only slightly lower than @xmath182 mev and the result is not dissimilar to that preferred in section 3.1 .",
    "however , in both the cases @xmath159 and @xmath175 there is a clear omission , namely of mixing with nearest neighbour states above the glueball when @xmath159 , ( section 3.2.1 ) , or below it when @xmath183 , ( section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath157 should indeed turn out to be @xmath184 , further analysis should be required involving the @xmath185 region , or the @xmath186 @xmath187wave continuum below 1 gev  @xcite .",
    "given the concerns expressed above about the @xmath159 and @xmath175 scenarios , it is the results of section 3.1 that are our preferred solution . with the hypotheses that the mixing describe the ratios of partial widths for each individual resonance and also among the resonances , we take into account the variability between wa102 data and world averages , and we allow for the uncertainties in flavour dependence of the glueball coupling .",
    "this gives our final result , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : j ] , [ eq : dataset ] , [ eq : k ] ) , as follows .    @xmath188    and for which @xmath157 = @xmath189 mev , @xmath190 = @xmath191 mev    and @xmath192 = @xmath193 mev .",
    "the specific numbers in the above matrix correlate with the specific values of @xmath194 but the generic structure shows the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inflimit ] ) .",
    "physically this reflects the dominant flavour - blind nature of the @xmath12 coupling , amplified by the proximity of @xmath152 whereas @xmath195 . in the degenerate limit of @xmath196",
    ", the mixing would indeed tend towards that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : inflimit ] ) .",
    "the most sensitive probe of flavours and phases is potentially in @xmath197 couplings .",
    "the advantage is that @xmath23 couple to the @xmath198 of the flavours in amplitude and so the net result is sensitive to the relative phases as well as the intensities . that this is a dominant dynamics is empirically well established for the @xmath199 and @xmath200 nonets",
    "; however it is moot whether it will in fact be so clean for the @xmath10 . if it is dominant for this @xmath8 also , then in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , ignoring mass - dependent effects , the above imply    @xmath201    for the case of the flavour blind glueball given in section 3.1 we get two predictions for these relationships : one for the case when we do not add the total widths as a constraint and one when we do .",
    "we have averaged these two values and used their difference as a measure of the systematic error @xmath202    the @xmath23 width of @xmath13 exceeding that of @xmath19 arises because the glueball is nearer to the @xmath63 than the @xmath65 .",
    "the pattern is radically different if nature chooses @xmath9 near to ( or even above ) the @xmath65 , in which case the @xmath13 has the smallest @xmath23 coupling of the three states @xcite . for example , in the case of flavour",
    "dependent mixing with @xmath34 @xmath203 @xmath35 ( section 3.2.1 ) we find @xmath204 contrast this with the case of flavour dependent mixing with @xmath34 @xmath205 @xmath36 ( section 3.2.2 ) for which @xmath206    this shows how these @xmath23 couplings have the potential to pin down the input pattern .",
    "however , we note a caution with regards to @xmath23 couplings necessarily being the arbiter on @xmath12 wavefunctions in the @xmath10 partial waves .",
    "a problem here is that @xmath10 states decay to meson pairs in s - wave ( this is kinematically forbidden for the low - lying @xmath200 or @xmath207 nonets ) and so meson loops may be expected to intercede between the @xmath23 and @xmath1 levels .",
    "insights from @xmath208 , from models and ultimately from lattice qcd will be needed to establish how clean in practice the @xmath23 measurements can be in the @xmath10 sector .",
    "our preferred solutions have two further implications for the production of these states in @xmath209 annihilations , in central @xmath210 collisions and in radiative @xmath211 decays that are in accord with data .",
    "these are interesting in that they are consequences of the output and were not used as constraints .",
    "the production of the @xmath212 states in @xmath213 is expected to be dominantly through the @xmath214 components of the @xmath212 state , possibly through @xmath9 , but not prominently through the @xmath215 components .",
    "( the possible presence of hidden @xmath18 at threshold , noted by @xcite is in general swamped by the above , and in any event appears unimportant in flight ) .",
    "the above mixing pattern implies that    @xmath216    experimentally  @xcite the relative production rates are ,    @xmath217    and there is no evidence for the production of the @xmath19",
    ". this would be natural if the production were via the @xmath17 component .",
    "the actual magnitudes would however be model dependent ; at this stage we merely note the consistency of the data with the results of the mixing analysis above .    for central production ,",
    "the cross sections of well established quarkonia in wa102 suggest that the production of @xmath18 is strongly suppressed @xcite relative to @xmath17 .",
    "the relative cross sections for the three states of interest here are    @xmath218    this would be natural if the production were via the @xmath63 and @xmath9 components in phase .",
    "in addition , the wa102 collaboration has studied the production of these states as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath119 , which is defined as the angle between the @xmath219 vectors of the two outgoing protons .",
    "an important qualitative characteristic of these data is that the @xmath19 and @xmath13 peak as @xmath220 whereas the @xmath3 is more peaked as @xmath221  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath9 and @xmath63 components are produced coherently as @xmath220 but out of phase as @xmath221 , then this pattern of @xmath119 dependence and relative production rates would follow ; however , the relative coherence of @xmath9 and @xmath63 requires a dynamical explanation .",
    "we do not have such an explanation and open this for debate .    in @xmath211 radiative",
    "decays , the absolute rates depend sensitively on the phases and relative strengths of the @xmath9 relative to the @xmath7 component , as well as the relative phase of @xmath79 and @xmath72 within the latter .",
    "the general pattern though is clear . following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite we expect that the coupling to @xmath9 will be large ; coupling to @xmath1 with  octet tendency \" will be suppressed ; coupling to @xmath1 with  singlet tendency \" will be intermediate .",
    "hence the rate for @xmath3 will be smallest as the @xmath9 interferes destructively against the @xmath1 with  singlet tendency \" .",
    "conversely , the @xmath19 is enhanced by their constructive interference .",
    "the @xmath13 contains @xmath1 with  octet tendency \" and its production will be driven dominantly by its @xmath9 content . if the @xmath9 mass is nearer to the @xmath63 than to the @xmath65 , as our results suggest , the @xmath9 component in @xmath13 is large and causes the @xmath222 rate to be comparable to @xmath223 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the branching ratio of br@xmath224 for the @xmath13 and @xmath19 is presented . using the wa102 measured branching fractions  @xcite for these resonances and assuming that all major decay modes have been observed , the total relative production rates in radiative @xmath211 decays can be calculated to be : @xmath225 which is consistent with the prediction above based on our mixed state solution .    in these mixed state solutions ,",
    "both the @xmath13 and @xmath19 have @xmath63 and @xmath65 contributions and so it would be expected that both would be produced in @xmath226 and @xmath227 interactions . the @xmath13 has clearly been observed in @xmath226 interactions : it was first observed in the @xmath228 final state , although at that time it was referred to as the @xmath229  @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for the production of the @xmath13 in @xmath230  @xcite .",
    "the signal is much weaker compared to the well known @xmath231 state the @xmath232 , as expected with our preferred mixings in eq .",
    "[ eq : result ] and the suppressed @xmath233 decay associated with the destructive @xmath234 phase in the wavefunction .",
    "there is evidence for the @xmath19 in the reaction @xmath235 , originally called the @xmath236  @xcite .",
    "one of the longstanding problems of the @xmath19 is that in - spite of its dominant @xmath237 decay mode it was not observed in @xmath227 experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , these concerns were based on the fact that initially the @xmath19 had @xmath238  =  2 . in fact , in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that if the @xmath19 had @xmath238  =  0 , as it has now been found to have , then the contribution in @xmath226 and @xmath227 are compatible .",
    "one word of caution should be given here : the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was performed with a @xmath239 rather than the @xmath13 as we know it today . as a further test of our solution",
    ", it would be nice to see the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite repeated with the mass and width of the @xmath13 and the decay parameters of the @xmath19 determined by the wa102 experiment .",
    "we took as our guide the prediction of lattice - qcd that , in the quenched approximation , @xmath240 gev , and we explored the implications of the hypothesis that this glueball mixes with its nearest @xmath1 neighbours .",
    "this led us naturally to focus on the physical states the @xmath241 and @xmath19 .",
    "this has been the philosophy behind several recent analyses , which appear different in detail at first sight , but which turn out to have certain robust common features .",
    "we have abstracted these and specified the critical data that are now required to make further progress .",
    "the first studies of mixing were based on the mass matrix and the assumption that the glueball-@xmath1 mixing is dominantly singlet in character .",
    "the resulting output of two states that have constructive interference  singlet tendency \" and one that has destructive  octet tendency \" is then general .",
    "this can be seen as a common feature of @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of the flavour content are correlated with the assumed masses of the bare glueball and quarkonium states .",
    "weingarten s initial work on the lattice assumed that the glueball was higher in mass than the @xmath72 member of the nonet ; this led to a large glueball component in the heaviest state , the @xmath19 - eq .",
    "( 5 ) and a large @xmath72 content for the @xmath13 .",
    "close and amsler in contrast assumed that the glueball was initially at a mass spanned by the nonet .",
    "this led to a different apportioning of the glue among the states , eq .",
    "( 6 ) , in particular the @xmath9 and @xmath72 have similar intensities in @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "subsequent work has also considered the decays into pseudoscalar pairs .",
    "the qualitative features of the mixing are preserved , essentially due to the assumed singlet dominance of the ( glueball ) mixing .",
    "a general feature of these later works has been the assumption that the glueball component of the wavefunctions has flavour independent couplings ; any deviation from this in the decays of the physical states is then due to the glueball - flavour mixed eigenstates .",
    "\\(1 ) the decay analyses want more @xmath65 in the @xmath5 and more @xmath9 in the @xmath3 .",
    "this is correlated to them wanting a rather light @xmath9 mass , whereby the @xmath9 mixes primarily with @xmath63 , leaving the  distant \" @xmath5 as @xmath65 in leading order with a 10 - 20 % @xmath9 intensity .",
    "\\(2 ) a corollary is that the @xmath65 content of the @xmath13 tends to be driven smaller by the decay analyses .",
    "this is in marked contrast to weingarten where the @xmath65 content of the @xmath13 dominates , driven by the nearness of @xmath242 to the physical eigenstate in his solution .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath9 decay is intrinsically flavour - blind , the results of the decay analyses would imply that the @xmath9 is rather light , nearer to the @xmath63 than to the @xmath65 .",
    "this is radically different to weingarten s assumption that @xmath243 .",
    "the latter requires , within the assumptions of our analysis , that @xmath9 couples to @xmath65 more strongly than to @xmath63 , and also that the coupling of @xmath244 meson pairs is stronger than @xmath245 to the same meson pairs .",
    "this latter result appears unnatural to us .",
    "it will be a challenge to lattice qcd to study these couplings to see if there is any sign of such unexpected behaviour . in the absence of such an anomaly",
    ", we anticipate that the likely inference of this analysis is that @xmath9 is rather light , nearer to @xmath63 than to @xmath65 .    with the hypotheses that the mixing describe the ratios of partial widths for each individual resonance and also among the resonances , allowing for variability between wa102 data and world averages , and allowing for the uncertainties in flavour dependence of the glueball coupling ,",
    "the results of section 3 lead us to the following summary for the favoured result :          \\(i ) in the quenched approximation one would expect an @xmath250 state that is mass degenerate with the @xmath63 state before any mixing .",
    "hence we would expect the @xmath250 to be in this region of @xmath251 mev .",
    "the existence and mass of any @xmath250 other than the @xmath252 is still controversial and we advertise this as an important datum that could further constrain analyses such as those we have made in this paper .",
    "the presence or absence of an @xmath250 in the mass region favoured by us could have implications for the interpretation of the @xmath252 and @xmath185 states .",
    "establishing the status of @xmath253 should be a high priority in the quest to understand the nature of the @xmath10 mesons .",
    "\\(ii ) we also note that our result that @xmath254 mev is consistent with what one would expect from @xmath255 or , equivalently , the naive accounting of masses for constituent quarks where @xmath256 gev .    in summary , based on the hypothesis that the scalar glueball mixes with the nearby @xmath7 nonet states , we have determined the flavour content of the @xmath241 and @xmath19 by studying their decays into all pseudoscalar meson pairs .",
    "it suggests that the @xmath157 is relatively light , nearer in mass to @xmath190 than @xmath192 .",
    "the solution we have found is also compatible with the relative production strengths of the @xmath241 and @xmath19 in @xmath210 central production , @xmath209 annihilations and @xmath211 radiative decays .",
