    "since the establishment of qcd the study of hadron states beyond the simple quark model , namely the qcd exotic states , has been a topical subject in hadron physics .",
    "however , for a long time decisive evidence for qcd exotics has been absent from experimental measurements . until recently ,",
    "more and more evidence in the heavy quark sector indicates possible candidates for the qcd exotics which are named as  xyz \" states .",
    "very recently , the lhcb collaboration reported observation of two multiquark states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath3 in the decay of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the masses of these two states are @xmath5 mev and @xmath6 mev , respectively , and their widths are @xmath7 mev and @xmath8 mev , respectively .",
    "their quantum numbers are determined by the partial wave analysis and the spins are @xmath9 and @xmath10 with opposite parities . since their decays into @xmath3 contain at least five quarks , they are ideal candidates for pentaquark states of @xmath11 .",
    "this experimental result immediately initiates a lot of discussions and studies .",
    "although there are immediate publications claiming their dynamic properties as a multiquark state  @xcite , it was also investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite that the anomalous triangle singularity ( ats ) may produce threshold enhancements to mimic the behavior of genuine states or to contribute on top of the genuine states .",
    "it is interesting to note that since these two states were observed in their decays into @xmath3 , it is natural to expect that they can be produced in @xmath2 photoproduction via the @xmath12 and @xmath13-channel process .",
    "this motivates us to investigate these two pentaquark candidates in @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "in particular , if they are genuine states , they should be created in @xmath2 photoproduction , while if they are the ats enhancement , they will not appear in @xmath14 since the ats condition can not be satisfied here .",
    "therefore , their production in @xmath2 photoproduction can provide direct evidence for their nature as genuine states .",
    "this process can be studied at jlab in the near future .",
    "another interesting process is @xmath15 where the production of the pentaquark states in the invariant spectrum of @xmath3 is also free of the ats ambiguity .",
    "such a possibility can be investigated by belle or future belle - ii .",
    "there have been studies of exotic hadrons via meson photoproduction @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the tetraquark candidate @xmath16 in meson photoproduction due to its strong coupling to @xmath17 .",
    "this is an alternative way to probe the property of @xmath16 .",
    "similar to @xmath16 , the pentaquark candidates @xmath0 and @xmath1 observed in their decays into @xmath3 as genuine states should have sizeable couplings to @xmath18 .",
    "one can expect that their decays into @xmath18 should be through the @xmath19 annihilations , or it means that such hidden - charm baryons can be created in @xmath2 photoproduction via the @xmath12-channel excitations .",
    "recent studies of hidden - charm pentaquark states can be found in the literature  @xcite where , however , only low spin states were investigated .",
    "the lhcb analysis favors that @xmath0 and @xmath1 to have higher spins of either @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "their production mechanism in @xmath18 scatterings should be investigated .",
    "the available data for @xmath2 photoproduction show that the cross section is dominated by the diffractive process , i.e. the pomeron exchanges .",
    "this is a @xmath20-channel process featured by the forward peaking in the differential cross section .",
    "there have been tremendous studies of the diffractive process in the literature ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the dominance of the diffractive process",
    ", it gives us an opportunity for searching for the hidden - charm pentaquark states in @xmath2 photoproduction which will be produced strongly via the @xmath12-channel transition and should dominate at off - forward kinematics .    in this work",
    "we study the photoproduction of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 off the proton , since this process can not satisfy the ats condition which makes it is a good place to distinguish a genuine state from the ats kinematic effect .",
    "we include the @xmath20 channel diffractive pomeron exchanges and the @xmath12-channel pentaquark productions . by assuming that the pentaquark states dominantly decay into @xmath3",
    ", we can extract their couplings to @xmath3 by different possible quantum numbers .",
    "we then provide the different cross sections where the angular distributions for different quantum numbers will allow us to learn their nature from experiment .",
    "as follows , we will present the formalism of our model in section ii .",
    "the numerical results follows in section iii and a brief summary will be given in section iv .",
    "in this section , we present detailed formulas for the dominant diffractive pomeron exchange in the @xmath20 channel and the pentaquark excitation in the @xmath12 channel in @xmath2 photoproduction .      in @xmath14 , the dominant contribution is the diffractive process which is accounted for by the pomeron exchange model  @xcite . in this scenario the pomeron mediates ( fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) the long range interaction between a confined quark and a nucleon .",
    "although the nature of pomeron ( generally interpreted as multi - soft - gluon exchanges ) is still unclear , it is a useful tool for describing the diffractive production of neutral vector mesons in the high energy region .",

    "so the pomeron - nucleon coupling is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 gives the strength of the coupling of a single pomeron to a light constituent quark , and @xmath25 represents the structure function of the nucleon which is expressed as follows @xmath26 with @xmath20 the @xmath20-channel momentum transfer squared .    taking the on - shell approximation for the quark loop , a gauge - fixing scheme  @xcite",
