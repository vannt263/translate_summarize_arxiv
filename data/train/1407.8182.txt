    "global symmetries have important consequences in the characterization of phases of matter .",
    "topological superconductors ( tsc ) , for example , are systems in which a global particle - hole symmetry protects robust edge states which are predicted to be majorana fermions , particles known for being their own anti - particles .",
    "these predictions , however , still lack some experimental evidence and , despite the recent efforts of the condensed matter community @xcite , no conclusion has been reached so far .",
    "majorana bound states ( mbs ) are immune to electromagnetic influences and this , along with their braiding properties and the possibility of forming non - local complex fermions , make them perfect candidates to be used in quantum computation platforms@xcite .",
    "the immunity to electromagnetic probing and the fragility of the tsc phase , however , make the experimental unveiling of these particles rather difficult .",
    "typical approaches in the search for evidence of majorana fermions involve transport experiments and the probing of zero - bias peaks .",
    "these are , on the other hand , typically plagued by ambiguities in the interpretation of the results .",
    "a complementary approach to these , based in thermodynamical measurements , is desirable , avoiding the aforementioned ambiguities .",
    "macroscopic quantum phenomena may provide such an alternative process .",
    "in particular , mesoscopic rf - squids have been shown to possess a quantum regime @xcite in which the flux through the squid ring ( generated by a macroscopic current ) fluctuates quantum mechanically .",
    "the reading of this flux is exactly such a thermodynamic type of measurement which avoids transport phenomena .",
    "it is our main goal in this work to describe a scenario in which mbs physics and macroscopic quantum phenomena are connected .",
    "we discuss imprints of mbs in the macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) behavior of the magnetic flux in a tsc loop in its quantum regime .",
    "besides the difficulties with experimental signatures , the very realization of tsc is , by itself , a challenge . up to date",
    ", no superconducting ( sc ) material is known to develop naturally its topological regime .",
    "analogous phases which behave , in all aspects , as tscs have been proposed and realized like the 5/2 state in fractional quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "strategies proposed for realizing tsc involve the use of proximity effects between trivial s - wave scs and other strong spin - orbit coupled materials .",
    "promising approaches are the coupling of s - wave scs to the helical modes along the edges of quantum spin - hall insulators ( qshi ) @xcite and the coupling of s - wave scs to quasi-1d nanowires of semiconductors with strong spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xcite    we depict in fig.[fig : squid ] the simplified model on which we focus in this work .",

    ", the wire effectively develops topological superconductivity and may be described as a kitaev chain @xcite .",
    "mbss arise at the edges of a kitaev wire and induce the so - called @xmath1 periodic topological josephson effect when two wires are allowed to couple @xcite . in our setup",
    ", we imagine the parent sc touching the wire along the whole of its length and acting as grounding for the chain .",
    "in such an example , we expect the @xmath1 periodicity to develop in the wire s jj , even if it is a single one .",
    "our particular choice of device , nevertheless , is not fundamental and , as we will discuss later on in this manuscript , similar physics would arise in other situations , as in the sc - qshi - sc junction .",
    "the @xmath1 periodicity has striking consequences in macroscopic quantum phenomena .",
    "majorana particles mediate tunneling only between even quantum flux states .",
    "this picture is to be contrasted with the trivial jj situation which allows for tunneling between states of any integer number of flux quanta .",
    "this means that the tunneling barrier in the topological case is much wider than that for the non - topological one .",
    "probing the topological phase transition then may be done comparing the changes in the tunneling rate of the device . in our device",
    ", however , the coupling between the topological wire and the parent sc introduces a dominant @xmath2 `` trivial '' josephson energy to the @xmath1 periodic one and we must study the interplay between these .",
    "a possible issue concerning our signatures is that the pair of mbss at the junction define a two - level system characterized by its occupancy through a fermionic parity observable . in real systems",
    "this parity conservation is frequently broken .",
    "defects and leads are sources for stray quasi - particles that may couple to the edge modes and change their fermionic parity state .",
    "these phenomena , generally dubbed quasi - particle poisoning , have been discussed in the past and are usually blamed for being responsible for washing away the @xmath1 periodic signatures .",
    "these effects , however , have been shown to induce other signatures like telegraph noise@xcite and multiple critical currents@xcite in open wire geometries .    as a first approach ,",
    "we focus ourselves on the treatment of the parity conserving limit pointing out how mqt and spectroscopy experiments may uncover the tsc phase .",
    "it is impossible , however to leave the quasi - particle poisoning issue without any comment .",
    "the characteristic time scales of fluctuations and tunneling have to be considered carefully .",
    "we adopt then an heuristic point of view and address what are the expected effects of parity fluctuations in the mqt signatures .",
    "we argue that the latter are expected to be quite robust against the quasi - particle poisoning and may even be enhanced , as long as the fluctuations are slower than the tunneling processes .",

    "an rf - squid consists of a sc loop ring interrupted by a narrower region or insulating barrier , which gives rise to a jj .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig : squid ] as the beige ring .",
    "the physics of the whole device is very successfully modeled by an rlc circuit with a jj circuit element @xcite as in fig.[fig : lumpedsquid ] .",
    "this is known as the resistor - capacitor shunted junction ( rcsj ) model .",
    "this model describes the interplay of the capacitive ( kinetic ) , resistive ( from leads and normal current components present around the loop , ) ( self-)inductive and jj current contributions to the flux piercing the ring .",
    "current conservation through the circuit and faraday s law results in the equation of motion @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the capacitance of the junction , @xmath6 is its resistance in the normal state , @xmath7 is the junction critical current , and @xmath8 is a fluctuating current represented by a delta correlated thermal noise .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of adding an externally controlled flux @xmath9 through the ring .",
    "the phase difference @xmath10 across the junction may be related to the magnetic flux in the closed geometry by the usual flux quantization rule . for a broken sc loop it gives@xcite @xmath11 as long as the sc is thicker than the london penetration depth .    in this way",
    ", the equation of motion reduces to @xmath12 which is a langevin equation of motion for a classical dissipative particle ( with coordinate @xmath13 ) in a conservative potential @xmath14 given by @xmath15,\\label{eq : upot}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and with @xmath13 ( here and henceforth ) measured in units of @xmath18 .    as a first approach",
    ", we neglect dissipation ( and noise ) and focus on the conservative part of the system in this work .",
    "the potential is depicted in fig.[fig : potschem ] for some arbitrary values of @xmath19 and @xmath9 .",
    "as long as the josephson energy ( i.e. @xmath19 ) is comparable to the inductive energy , ripples develop in the parabolic potential , giving rise to local metastable minima .    for high enough temperatures",
    ", the flux may be thermally excited and will slip to lower minima .",
    "each minimum defines an oscillation frequency @xmath20 from which a characteristic temperature may be defined as @xmath21 parameters like @xmath22 f , @xmath23 h lead to @xmath24 k ( these parameters also lock @xmath7 to @xmath25 a ) .",
    "this means that if the system is set at temperatures lower than @xmath26 , it may resolve the discrete energy levels within the metastable wells . in this case , even if temperatures are much lower than the barrier height , the flux may still escape to lower energy wells , now due to quantum tunneling .",
    "this is the macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomenon .",
    "@xcite    ]    ]",
    "to model the coupled topological and trivial squids , we start assuming fermionic parity conservation .",
    "the wire in a topological phase allows for the introduction of a topological jj term in addition to the usual josephson current .",
    "the wire is assumed to be much thinner than the sc ring , so that the capacitance and inductance of the device are predominantly defined by the corresponding values from the parent sc and do not depend much on the chemical potential of the wire .",
    "we also assume the linear dimensions of the parent sc to be longer than the sc penetration depth in such a way that the squid flux `` quantization '' condition is not changed .",
    "finite - size effects of the ring are not taken into account .",
    "the coupling between the wire and parent sc serves as grounding for the wire and allows for the parity anomaly .",
    "the full potential energy thus has @xmath2 and @xmath1 periodic contributions which compete for making @xmath13 ( close to ) an arbitrary or even - only integer .",
    "we consider then a new jj element to the rcsj model .",
    "the conditions of thin wire guarantee that the phase across the topological jj is also controlled by the phase across the parent sc junction .",
    "the new potential energy of the problem becomes @xmath27.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 is a parameter given by the ratio @xmath29 between the critical currents of the parent s - wave junction and the topological one .",
    "its magnitude is roughly controlled by the ratio between the magnitudes of the parent sc gap and the induced p - wave gap in the wire .",
    "it will depend on the strength of the proximity effect and on the parent sc 2d density of states .",
    "for high chemical potentials , the 1d wire is in a trivial sc phase , whereas for low chemical potentials it enters the topological regime @xcite .",
    "a subtlety concerns the sign of @xmath30 .",
    "it is determined by which parity sector the system is in @xcite , and , as we assumed the fermionic parity to be conserved , is fixed to a given value along a complete tunneling process.we will come back to this point and address the possibility of fluctuations of this occupancy of the non - local two - level system generated by the mbss .",
    "taking all that in consideration , we treat @xmath28 phenomenologically . assuming that , through gating , we may tune the chemical potential , @xmath30 changes from zero to a saturated value as the chemical potential moves from the trivial to the topological regime .",
    "this general behavior is depicted in fig.[fig : critcur ] .",
    "as the chemical potential goes from smaller to larger values , the majorana edge modes penetrate the bulk of the wire and , when in the trivial phase , end up coupling and generating a complex fermion which annihilates the topological contribution . in the trivial regime",
    "the wire may give a small contribution to the @xmath2 josephson energy .",
    "we neglect these effects assuming that whatever @xmath2 periodic contribution there may be , it is already included in @xmath19 .",
    "this potential also assumes a short junction . in the long junction limit ,",
    "more bound states develop at the junction and the physics becomes more complicated @xcite .",
    "since the wire is much thinner than the s - wave sc and since the p - wave pairing induced in the wire depends on the proximity coupling , it is reasonable to assume that the saturated value of @xmath30 is not very large and we will focus our quantitative discussions on this case . on the other hand , by adding to the the jj of the parent sc a secondary loop , we may actually control the value of @xmath19 @xcite , and as such , of @xmath30 , thus allowing for some control on this parameter .    at this point",
    "we are ready to discuss qualitatively the consequences of this proposal .",
    "we look mainly at two possible signatures , namely , changes in the tunneling rates and shifts in the harmonic oscillator levels .",
    "the former might be probed in actual tunneling experiments while the latter may be studied in spectroscopy or coherent tunneling experiments .",
    "fig.[fig : signatures ] illustrates the two phenomena and summarizes our main ideas .    , and blue curves a generic saturated ( negative ) value of @xmath30 in the topological regime .",

    "( bottom ) frequency shifts due to changes in curvature lead to shifts in the discrete energy levels ; [ fig : signatures ] ]    one sees how the competition between arbitrary integer and even integer flux takes place .",
    "the @xmath31 well becomes shallower while the @xmath32 one is deepened in comparison with the trivial situation ( this actually depends on the sign of @xmath30 , whose subtleties will be discussed further ahead , and , for now , we keep in mind that the opposite sign would only bring an opposite scenario )",
    ".    we may exploit many different schemes to study the consequences of the topological regime .",
    "fig.[fig : cases ] gives some possibilities .",
    "in all cases we take a physical value of @xmath33 and shift @xmath9 around the symmetric value for the non - topological regime @xmath34 . for the sake of clearly describing the different situations",
    "we take a value of @xmath35 .",
    "we note , however , that its actual physical value might be much smaller .    in figs.[fig : casea ] and [ fig : caseb ] we see how situations of enhancing and suppressing the tunneling in the well may be exchanged , just by tilting the potential monitoring @xmath9 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "these plots also make clear that the suppression or enhancement are actually not symmetric around @xmath34 .",
    "the last two cases of [ fig : casec ] and [ fig : cased ] present very interesting possible applications . in fig.[fig : casec ] , we see that starting with a symmetric potential , in a schrdinger s cat state , we may transform the qubit into a simple classical bit or tune the quantum state into a preferred value of the flux , just as a function of the chemical potential . in fig.[fig :",
    "cased ] we see how to create an adiabatic pump from the unit flux to zero flux and back by lowering the chemical potential into the topological regime and raising it back to the trivial situation .",
    "now we discuss quantitatively the consequences of our proposals . in order",
    "to keep ourselves on safe physical grounds , we use real parameters and units taken from @xcite .",
    "namely , we have @xmath38 f , @xmath39 h and keep in mind that experiments are done at temperatures of the order of @xmath40 k. we consider shallow potentials , as tunneling signatures are our main goals . for comparison , we take the same values for the flux bias and @xmath19 parameters when calculating frequencies and tunneling rates .",
    "note however that , if resonance experiments are in mind , deeper wells should be preferred , as many oscillation levels may develop in this case .",
    "with all these in mind , we may calculate the frequency and tunneling rate shifts as functions of @xmath30 .    for the frequency",
    "we locate numerically the minima of the potential as a function of @xmath30 and evaluate equation ( [ eq : freq ] ) . in fig.[fig : freqeta ] we plot the corresponding results , for both positive and negative values of @xmath30 and for @xmath41 ( in red ) and @xmath42 ( in blue ) .",
    "the results show that if we have a ratio of about 5% between the majorana critical current and the parent squid critical current , we may achieve a frequency shift of @xmath431 ghz .",
    "different values of @xmath19 shift the curves and , for small @xmath30 , the slopes have small deviations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that smaller values of @xmath19 actually also enhance @xmath30 , since this is a ratio of the critical currents .     as a function of the maximum value of @xmath30 .",
    "we parameters for the squid as described in the text and @xmath44 , @xmath42 ( blue ) and @xmath45 , @xmath41 ( red ) . comparing ,",
    "smaller @xmath19 gives more expressive shifts in the frequency.[fig : freqeta ] ]    for the tunneling rate the calculation is slightly more involved . in the non - dissipative limit",
    "it may be simply calculated from callan and coleman s instanton calculation scheme @xcite . in summary",
    ", it resumes to a saddle point approximation in the path integral approach , considering paths in an inverted potential starting and ending at the equilibrium point .",

    "the prime in the denominator determinant in @xmath51 means that the zero eigenvalue should be omitted .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is the width of the barrier the particle has to tunnel through and @xmath53 is again the small oscillations frequency around the metastable minimum .",

    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : tunrate ] . again , for different values of @xmath19 , the slopes of the curves change . in particular , again for @xmath58 ( 5% ratio between critical currents ) , the tunneling rate presents variations of @xmath59 hz .    .",

    "as mentioned before , some care must be taken regarding the depth of the wells , when thinking of tunneling or resonance signatures .",
    "frequencies must always be kept at small values , such that we avoid exciting undesirable quasi - particles in resonance experiments . also",
    ", in tunneling experiments small tunneling rates demand too large coherence times to observe the tunneling .",
    "it is remarkable that , nevertheless , the expected signatures manifest themselves in such a way that one can hope to actually measure them .",
    "now we turn to the problem of parity fluctuations .",
    "as discussed beforehand , in this section we adopt a more heuristic point of view , discussing the consequences more qualitatively and leaving a proper treatment of the issue for future work .",
    "we will show that not only mqt measurements are robust against parity fluctuations , but also that these fluctuations enhance the differences in the tunneling rates .",
    "the issue of fluctuations actually enriches the problem",
    ". we must now be careful with the different time scales present , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the first time scale we need to think about is the one which controls the parity fluctuation .",
    "the second time scale is the one related to the evolution of the phase difference across the jj .",
    "two main sources of fermions are responsible for fluctuations , namely , thermal excitation of quasiparticles or hopping from localized states in the bulk .",
    "these mechanisms are exponentially suppressed at low temperatures . in the case when this process happens much faster than the evolution of the sc phase ( or the magnetic flux in our case ) , one has to be careful and consider a proper thermal average of the current @xcite .",
    "a rigorous way to take this situation into account is to model phenomenologically the parity fluctuation through a fokker - planck equation and consider all possible combinations of tunneling processes @xcite .",
    "we argue that this situation is improbable as follows . as long as the phase is away from @xmath0 , as in the two potential wells of our potential , the different parity branches are far away from each other .",
    "the gap separating them is large ( of the order of the induced p - wave gap magnitude ) and the low temperatures , necessary for the macroscopic quantum behavior of the device to manifest itself , should be enough to suppress fluctuations @xcite . in an adiabatic evolution of the phase through @xmath0 , however , the system may access the crossing point and even the lowest temperatures may introduce corrections .",
    "it turns out that quantum tunneling do not describe adiabatic evolutions of the phase . in a thermally activated",
    "phase slip , one might describe the time within which the process take place by dividing the total `` distance '' traveled by the `` particle '' by its speed . in our case ,",
    "the situation is mode subtle .",
    "tunneling rates describe the lifetime of a metastable state but the transition itself is much faster . since the phase / flux behaves quantum mechanically as a `` position operator '' , defining how long the system spends at a given transition is not necessarily straightforward .",
    "the problem of the tunneling time is controversial and has been explored extensively @xcite .",
    "a characteristic time for this process is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the imaginary momentum under the barrier , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the height of the barrier . in the mechanical picture , this is the same as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 the mass of the particle and @xmath66 the width of the potential barrier . in our case ,",
    "@xmath67 but it has been argued that it is not always that this time has physical significance @xcite .",
    "a safe claim is that , for sure , the time evolution of the phase across the junction is not adiabatic in a tunneling experiment and we focus our attention now onto the picture that parity fluctuations are slower than the tunneling process . in this case",
    ", the parity symmetry breaking will allow for the coupling and gapping of the two parity eigenstates .",
    "the simple way to model this is to consider the low energy projected hamiltonian as @xmath68\\right),\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath69 are the majorana modes at the wire s ends , defining a two - level system given by the complex fermions @xmath70 this hamiltonian is to be regarded as a mean - level description of the hamiltonian in @xcite , which describes inelastic processes responsible for parity flipping events .",
    "we just want to study the qualitative features of this system and , as such , capture them into the parameters @xmath71 , which are normalized by @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath72 , this hamiltonian does not conserve the fermionic parity and a gap opens up in the andreev bound states spectrum as illustrated in fig.[fig : zmspectrum ] .    for non - vanishing @xmath73 ,",
    "a gap is opened at the two different parity states , restoring the @xmath2 periodicity to the energy levels .",
    "the new potential for the squid is then given by @xmath74.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , a gap of order @xmath73 opens up in the andreev states spectrum .",
    "this situation actually leads to two consequences .",
    "firstly , @xmath73 lifts the degeneracy of the trivial potential at @xmath75 .",
    "this slight raising or lowering of the potential barrier has little consequences for tunneling rates .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the coefficient @xmath50 depends linearly on the frequency @xmath53 and quadratically on @xmath57 .",
    "the raising / lowering of the barrier height by @xmath73 mainly affects the frequency , leaving the width intact and generating very small corrections to the tunneling rate",
    ".    there is , however , a second important point .",
    "figures [ fig : zmspectrum ] and [ fig : paritybrokenfluxpot ] summarizes the situation .",
    "the spectrum has no @xmath1 periodicity anymore .",
    "one sees , in a closer analysis , that effectively the new potential interpolates between the two parity states , exchanging to opposite parities as @xmath13 crosses @xmath76 .",
    "consider for definiteness that the system is prepared in the positive @xmath30 state .",
    "the tunneling barrier width @xmath57 now has become wider and this clearly gives a substantial deviation to the tunneling rate .",
    "the opposite would happen if one started from the red curve , with a shrinking of @xmath57 but still a substantial deviation to the tunneling rate from the trivial case would take place . in many realizations one would have to average over the two possibilities .    ,",
    "@xmath35 and we compare @xmath77 ( red ) and @xmath78 ( blue , dashed . ) ]    clearly , at @xmath58 , if @xmath77 we have an enhancement of the tunneling rate as compared to @xmath78 .",
    "this shows that a slow parity fluctuation acts in favor of the tunneling signatures for detecting tsc in rf - squids .",
    "one notices , on the other hand , that the flux pumps described in fig.[fig : cased ] and the `` transmutation '' of a qubit into a classical bit from [ fig : casec ] are not possible in this situation .",
    "we now briefly extend the discussion of the previous sections to the case of @xmath0- junctions .",
    "we have been considering the total phase across the junction to be totally controlled by the flux through the loop .",
    "now we assume that the sc also builds a @xmath0 phase across the junction .",
    "the idea follows from the discussion in@xcite , where the andreev spectrum of the kitaev wire is studied thoroughly .",
    "this discussion encompasses several cases , including open and closed wires and finite size effects .",
    "it is seen that both open and closed limits may be made symmetric under proper conditions , such that the potential becomes sinusoidal .",
    "the flux dynamics is then described by the following potential , @xmath79.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] competition between even and odd minima now is absent . both wells",
    "are lifted or lowered , depending on the parity eigenstate , as illustrated in fig.[fig : sinepot ] .",
    "this is however , different from the parity broken case discussed in the last section , as the topological part of the potential is clearly @xmath1 periodic .",

    "the typical behavior of the signatures in frequency and tunneling rates are quite remarkable in this case , since they are the opposite from the case of the open wire . as one can see in fig.[fig : sineshifts ] , the roles of positive and negative parity are now inverted .",

    "parity breaking is found to work in favor of the detection of the topological phase , as long as the fluctuations are slower than the phase evolution .",
    "as we argued , due to the non - adiabatic nature of the flux tunneling process , it is reasonable to expect this to be the general case .",

    ", the authors also propose to detect the tsc phase in a sc - qshi - sc junction by addressing the consequences of strong parity fluctuations in thermally activated phase slipping .",
    "the authors claim , on the other hand , that in the zero temperature limit , telegraph noise ( from parity fluctuation events ) averages the voltage across the device to zero at low external currents .",
    "quantum tunneling implies that a drift will actually remain , even in the very low temperature limit , and a finite voltage should develop even for very small bias currents .",
    "the setup in which we described our ideas requires fine tuning of the device to achieve topological superconductivity , as well as means for tuning into and out of the topological phase . for simplicity , we restricted ourselves to a toy model based on the sc coupled to strong so wire device of @xcite .",
    "our ideas , however , do not rely much on the geometry of the device .",
    "corbino geometries like described in fu and kane @xcite or , as discussed , open sc - qshi - sc current biased junctions are most likely the proper systems in which this physics should be studied .",
    "these junctions are very promising systems for the realization of the tsc phase , among other reasons , for avoiding the necessity of chemical potential fine tuning .",
    "tuning between phases in these situations is also easily achieved by the application of in - plane magnetic fields .",
    "these devices are , however , characterized by larger majorana contributions to the critical currents as compared to the @xmath2 periodic one , that is , these systems work in the regime of large @xmath30 . in this case , mqt between even integer flux states may be achieved , with small shifts from the expected rates due to the non - topological currents .",
    "parity fluctuations will likely spoil the @xmath1 periodicity of the potential again , restoring the tunneling barrier width to a much smaller value corresponding to non - topological regime .",
    "besides the above discussed points , we considered the @xmath0-junction limit which might be of relevance under the light of the new proposals of development of tsc from d - wave parent scs @xcite .",
