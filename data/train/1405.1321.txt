    "the starobinsky model of inflation @xcite with an @xmath11 interaction term is of interest as it requires no extra scalar fields but relies on the scalar degree of the metric tensor to generate the inflaton potential .",
    "the @xmath12 starobinsky model gives rise to a plateau potential of the inflaton when transformed to the einstein frame .",
    "this model was favored by the planck constraint on the tensor to scalar ratio which ruled out potentials like @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in addition the starobinsky model could be mapped to the higgs - inflation models with @xmath15 theory @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the starobinsky equivalent models was the prediction that the tensor to scalar ratio was @xmath16 .",
    "bicep2 reported a large value of @xmath17 @xcite but the recent joint analysis by planck + bicep2 + keck array give only an upper bound of @xmath18 @xcite . in an analysis of the genus structure of the b - mode polarisation of planck + bicep2 data by colley",
    "et al . put the tensor to scalar ratio at @xmath19 @xcite . in the light of the possibility that @xmath20 can be larger than the starobinsky model prediction of @xmath21 , generalisations of the starobinsky model are of interest .",
    "we study a general power law @xmath22 correction to the einstein gravity and compute the scalar and tensor power spectrum as a function of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath11 model is equivalent to the @xmath15 higgs - inflation model as they led to the same scalar potential in the einstein frame @xcite .",
    "one can find similar equivalence between generalized higgs - inflation models and the power law starobinsky model whose common feature is violation of the global weyl symmetry . a general scalar curvature coupled @xmath25 model was studied in @xcite .",
    "the quantum correction on @xmath26-potential in jordan frame was studied in @xcite where they have shown the equivalence of the @xmath27 model with @xmath28 model . the generalized starobinsky model with @xmath29 correction",
    "has been studied in the ref .",
    "in general scalar - curvature theories the scalar plays the role of the inflaton after transforming to einstein frame whereas in pure curvature theories like @xmath30 model the longitudinal part of the graviton is the equivalent scalar in the einstein frame plays the role of inflaton .",
    "the higher order curvature theories arise naturally in theories of supergravity .",
    "the supergravity embedding of the higgs - inflation @xcite does not produce a slow roll potential in mssm but a potential suitable for inflation is obtained in nmssm @xcite .",
    "the potential in nmssm however has a tachyonic instability in the direction orthogonal to the slow roll @xcite .",
    "this instability can be cured by the addition of quartic terms of the fields in the khler potential @xcite .    in the context of a supergravity embedding of the starobinsky model ,",
    "it was shown by cecotti@xcite that quadratic ricci curvature terms can be derived in a supergravity theory by adding two chiral superfields in the minimal supergravity .",
    "a no - scale sugra@xcite model with a modulus field and the inflation field with a minimal wess - zumino superpotential gives the same f - term potential in the einstein frame as the starobinsky model @xcite .",
    "the symmetry principle which can be invoked for the sugra generalization of the starobinsky model is the spontaneous violation of superconformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the quadratic curvature can also arise from d - term in a minimal - sugra theory with the addition of a vector and chiral supermultiplets @xcite .",
    "the starobinsky model has been derived from the d - term potential of a sugra model @xcite .",
    "quartic powers of ricci curvature in the bosonic lagrangian can also be obtained in a sugra model by the d - term of higher order powers of the field strength superfield @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a sugra model for the general power law @xmath31 model .",
    "we show that adding a @xmath32 term to the minimal no - scale khler potential and with a wess - zumino form of the superpotential @xmath33 yields the same potential in the einstein frame as the generalised starobinsky model . in the limit",
    "@xmath34 the starobinsky limit @xmath1 is obtained .",
    "we derive the relations between the two parameters of the power - law starobinsky model and the two parameters of our sugra model .",
    "the interesting point about the generalization is that small deviations from the starobinsky limit of @xmath35 can produce large shifts in the values of @xmath20 .",
    "many sugra models have been constructed which can yield a range of @xmath20 from @xmath36 by changing the parameters of the khler potential and the superpotential @xcite .",
    "we also show in this paper that our 2-parameter sugra model which we relate to the 2-parameter @xmath37 model is the most economical representation of the 5-parameter scalar - curvature coupled inflation models @xmath38 in terms of the number of parameters .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in the section ( [ power - law ] ) , we calculate an equivalent scalar potential in the einstein frame for @xmath39 gravity .",
    "we then find the parameter @xmath23 and @xmath24 values which satisfy the observed amplitude @xmath40 , spectral index @xmath41 and tensor to scalar @xmath20 .",
    "we fix model parameters for two cases : one with running of @xmath42 and another without running of @xmath42 . in the section ( [ sugra ] ) ,",
    "we give a sugra embedding of the @xmath28 model with a specific choice of the khler potential @xmath43 and superpotential @xmath44 . in the section ( [ higgs - inflation ] ) , we show that the generalized curvature coupling model @xmath38 is equivalent to @xmath45 model and give the relation between the parameters of these two generalized models .",
    "finally we conclude in section ( [ concl ] ) .",
    "we start with a @xmath10 action of the form @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the determinant of the metric @xmath49 and @xmath23 is a dimensionless real parameter .",
    "the subscript @xmath50 refers to jordan frame which indicates that the gravity sector is not the einstein gravity form .",
    "the action  ( [ eq1 ] ) can be transformed to an einstein frame action using the conformal transformation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the conformal factor and tilde represents quantities in the einstein frame . under conformal transformation the ricci scalar @xmath53 in the two frames is related by r=(+3 -^ _ _ ) [ rex ] where @xmath54 .",
    "if one choose the conformal factor to be @xmath55 and introduce a new scalar field @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 , using ( [ rex ] ) , the action ( [ eq1 ] ) gets transform to an einstein hilbert form : @xmath58 \\label{ein}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the einstein frame potential given by @xmath60 which , by using the @xmath10 form ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath61 , can be given explicitly in terms of model parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 as u ( ) & = & ( ) ^ + & & ^[u1 ] where we have taken @xmath62 and from here onwards we shall work in @xmath62 units . also we see that in the limit @xmath63 potential ( [ u1 ] ) reduces to exponentially corrected flat plateau potential of the starobinsky model .    assuming large field limit @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the potential ( [ u1 ] ) reduces to u ( ) ( ) ^ [ u2 ] we shall use eq.([u2 ] ) later in the section ( [ sugra ] ) to compare with sugra version of the power law potential in the large field limit . in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the potential for small deviations from the starobinsky model value @xmath1 .",
    "we see that the potential is very flattest for @xmath1 but becomes very steep even with small deviation from starobinsky model value @xmath1 .",
    "the scalar curvature perturbation @xmath66 is fixed from observations which implies that the magnitude of the potential @xmath59 would have to be larger as @xmath67 increases for steep potential .",
    "the tensor perturbation which depends on the magnitude of @xmath59 therefore increases rapidly as @xmath24 varies from @xmath68 .",
    "the variation of @xmath20 with @xmath24 is shown in the fig.[fig3 ] .    from eq.([u1 ] ) , in the large field approximation , the slow roll parameters in einstein frame can be obtained as & = & ( ) ^2 + & & ^2 [ slow1 ] & = & + & & & = & + & & the field value @xmath69 at the end of inflation can be fixed from eq.([slow1 ] ) by using the end of inflation condition @xmath70 . and the initial scalar field value @xmath71 corresponding to @xmath72 e - folds before the end of inflation , when observable cmb modes leave the horizon , can be fixed by using the e - folding expression @xmath73 .    under slow - roll approximation",
    "we use the standard einstein frame relations for the amplitude of the curvature perturbation @xmath74 , the spectral index @xmath75 , the running of spectral index @xmath76 and the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath77 to fix the parameters of our model .",
    "note that the superscript @xmath78 indicates that the the observables are evaluated at the initial field value @xmath71 .    we know from cmb observations , for 8-parameter @xmath79+@xmath20+@xmath80 model , that if there is a large running of the spectral index @xmath81 at ( @xmath82 , plancktt+lowp ) then the amplitude is @xmath83 , the spectral index is @xmath84 and tensor to scalar ratio is @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , plancktt+lowp ) @xcite . also a joint bicep2/keck array and planck analysis",
    "put an upper limit on @xmath18 .",
    "since the scalar potential @xmath59 depends on both the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 whereas the slow roll parameters depend only on @xmath24 , therefore parameter @xmath23 affects only the scalar amplitude @xmath87 whereas @xmath20 , @xmath42 and @xmath80 which depend only on slow roll parameters remain unaffected by @xmath23 . therefore taking amplitude from the observation and fixing the number of e - foldings @xmath88 fixes the value of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we find numerically that for the best fit parameter values @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the e - foldings turns out to be @xmath91 .",
    "the tensor to scalar ratio can be further reduced to @xmath92 for @xmath93 , @xmath94 but e - foldings still comes out to be low @xmath95 , see fig.[fig2](upper panel ) . therefore constraining model parameters using running data",
    "implies that cosmological problems like horizon and flatness problems which require a minimum of @xmath96 e - foldings can not be solved with the power law generalization of the starobinsky model . also from cmb observations , for 7-parameter @xmath79+@xmath20 model , when there is no scale dependence of the scalar and tensor spectral indices the bound on @xmath20 becomes tighter @xmath97 ( @xmath86 , plancktt+lowp ) and the amplitude and the spectral index become @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively at ( @xmath82 , plancktt+lowp ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 which satisfy the amplitude and the spectral index for @xmath102 gives large @xmath103 .",
    "also we see that for @xmath89 and @xmath104 tensor to scalar ratio can be reduced to @xmath105 but it increases @xmath106 , see fig.[fig2](lower panel ) .",
    "in this section we give a sugra model of the power law starobinsky model .",
    "we shall derive a model where the scalar potential in the einstein frame is the same as eq.([u2 ] ) which we have shown in the section ( [ power - law ] ) is equivalent to the power law starobinsky model @xmath107 .",

    "<S> we find that in order to get large tensor perturbation @xmath4 as indicated by bkp measurements , we require the value of @xmath5 thereby breaking global weyl symmetry . we show that the general @xmath6 model can be obtained from a sugra construction by adding a power law @xmath7 term to the minimal no - scale sugra khler potential . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that this two parameter power law generalization of the starobinsky model is equivalent to generalized non - minimal curvature coupled models with quantum corrected @xmath8- potentials i.e. models of the form @xmath9 and thus the power law starobinsky model is the most economical parametrization of such models .    </S>",
