    "until recently , afterglows of short gamma - ray bursts have proven to be extremely elusive , frustrating efforts to identify their progenitors and environments .",

    "xrt observations continued until 2006 january 3 ( 13.7  days after the trigger ) , although the source became undetectable by xrt after about 11 days post - burst , and only upper limits are available at later times .",

    "were used in the analysis ( see * ? ? ? * for xrt event grade definitions ) . for the pc mode data , we selected events in the same energy range with grades 012 .",
    "the grb afterglow was located near a hot column on the ccd .",
    "the position on the detector changes with each orbit , leading to a significant loss of effective area for some orbits during which the psf core falls partially on the columns that are masked off by the analysis software . in order to minimize the impact on our data analysis",

    "data in the first 200  s of pc mode , when the source count rate exceeds @xmath26  counts  s@xmath15 , were affected by pile - up , and were corrected by excluding events within a circle of 2 pixels radius around the afterglow ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the last three  data points extend the x - ray light curve of grb051221a out to 16 january 2006 .",
    "the observations were performed in faint or very faint mode with the standard 3.2  s frame time .",
    "data were reduced using version 3.3 of the ciao software with caldb version 3.2.1 .",
    "events from the grb afterglow were selected using a source extraction radius of @xmath29 for the 2005 december observations and @xmath30 for the 2006 january observations .",
    "background regions were chosen from a source - free area using a radius 10 times larger than the source region .",
    "a preliminary  position for the afterglow was given in @xcite , based on the standard  attitude solution , which is typically good to about @xmath31 .",
    "we have improved the astrometry of the first  observation by reference to the 2mass system .",
    "the /acis data were reprocessed with pixel randomization turned off in order to provide the most accurate positions .",
    "we find 33 x - ray sources on ccds s2 and s3 within 6 arcminutes of the grb position with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 2.7 .",
    "these were matched to the 2mass catalog to look for near - ir counterparts , resulting in 6 potential matches .",

    "we applied these offsets to the best - fit  position ( using a circular gaussian fit to the image ) to obtain the final position of the x - ray afterglow : @xmath35 the rms residuals are @xmath36 in ra and @xmath37 in declination .",

    "these results are in good agreement with the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectral results , indicating no change in spectral parameters from the early portion of the light curve to the late portion at @xmath51  s post - burst .      using the best fit spectral parameters for the xrt data",
    ", we obtained a mean exposure - corrected conversion factor between xrt count rate and unabsorbed source flux in the 0.310 kev band of @xmath52 for this afterglow , taking into account the fraction of the psf contained within the source extraction region . the xrt light curve shown in figure  [ fig : lc ]",
    "was generated by multiplying the background - subtracted xrt count rate by the energy conversion factor ( ecf ) appropriate for each orbit of data ( since the exposure varies as described in ",
    "[ observe ] ) .",
    "a similar procedure was used to convert the  count rates to flux units , using the  spectral fit results discussed in  [ sec : spectral ] to calculate the /acis - s ecf for this source , @xmath53 .",
    "table  [ tbl : lc ] gives the fluxes and uncertainties for all the x - ray data points from figure  [ fig : lc ] . for times periods before about 100 ks , our xrt fluxes are systematically about 40% higher than those reported by @xcite , with better agreement at later times .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , the xrt light curve can be approximated as two power law segments of roughly equal slope separated by a flatter segment .",
    "the best - fit power law slope for the data from @xmath54s to @xmath55s is @xmath56 , while the third segment ( from @xmath57s ) has a best - fit decay index of @xmath58 .",
    "the afterglow becomes undetectable in the xrt after 11 days , but the  observations at later times show clear evidence for a deviation from the earlier power - law slope .",
    "since the slopes of the first and third segments are consistent within the uncertainties , we fixed these slopes to be the same in our following analysis .",
    "we then obtained the following best - fit results to the entire x - ray light curve :    * the initial decay index is @xmath59 , * the first break occurs at @xmath60  ks , after which the decay index is @xmath61 , * the second break occurs at @xmath62  ks and is followed by a decay index of @xmath63 , * the third break occurs at @xmath64  ks and is followed by a decay index of @xmath65 .",
    "( the uncertainties in the final break time and final slope were obtained by fixing @xmath66 and calculating the confidence region in the @xmath67/@xmath68 plane satisfying @xmath69 , representing a 90% confidence region for 2 interesting parameters . )",
    "the  data were critically important in determining the parameters of the late portion of the light curve .",
    "the fit to the third segment is dominated by the small uncertainties in the first two observations , which were each binned into a single point for this fit , although we show them binned at finer time resolution in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the last segment of the light curve depends almost entirely on the  data for definition of the break time and slope .",
    "the overall fit has @xmath70 for 26 degrees of freedom . by comparison , the best fit model with a single slope after 15 ks ( no jet break )",
    "has @xmath71 with @xmath72 for 26 degrees of freedom .",
    "finally a fit with a single slope of 1.20 after 15 ks ( as shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] ) has @xmath73 for 27 degrees of freedom .",
    "we conclude that the third break in the light curve is required by the data .",
    "we note that the x - ray light curve shows evidence for a strong energy injection episode in the time range ( 220030,000s ) , as discussed in more detail by @xcite .",
    "this is the first clear evidence for energy injection into the external shock for a short grb , and requires a mechanism for refreshing the external shock similar to those proposed for long grbs , but operating in the context of short grb models .",
    "we interpret the last break in the x - ray light curve as a jet break .",
    "these data , based on a well - sampled and well - behaved x - ray light curve , constitute the best measurement yet of a jet break for a short grb .",
    "the jet parameters can be obtained by fitting a model of jet evolution to the available radio , optical , and x - ray lightcurves .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we model the afterglow of grb051221a with a uniform relativistic jet undergoing lateral expansion and interacting with a homogeneous circumburst medium .",
    "the calculation of the synchrotron emission from the electrons accelerated by the forward shock is done assuming that the distribution of the electrons with energy is a power - law and that the electron and magnetic field energies are constant fractions ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ) of the post - shock energy .",
    "radiative losses , the spread in the photon arrival time due to the curvature of the emitting surface , and the relativistic beaming of the radiation are taken into account .",
    "the emission from the reverse shock sweeping into the out - flowing ejecta , synchrotron self - absorption ( at radio frequencies ) , the effect of inverse - compton scattering on electron cooling and its contribution to the x - ray light curve are also included but , for the best - fit parameters obtained for 051221a , are not important .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined by minimization of @xmath76 between the model fluxes and the x - ray , optical , and radio measurements .",
    "the basic jet model has six parameters : three for the jet dynamics ( initial energy @xmath77 , initial opening @xmath78 , and circumburst medium density @xmath79 ) and three for the jet emission ( the two microphysical parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the slope @xmath80 of the electron distribution ) .",
    "the available radio , optical , and x - ray measurements determine three or four characteristics of the afterglow synchrotron emission ( peak flux , location of the injection and cooling break frequencies , and possibly the self - absorption frequency ) , depending on whether the self - absorption frequency is below or above the radio , which constrain @xmath77 , @xmath79 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the spectral slope of the optical and x - ray continua , as well as the optical and x - ray decay indices , over - constrain the electron index @xmath81 .",
    "the epoch of the last break in the x - ray light curve determines primarily the initial jet opening angle .",
    "finally , the injected kinetic energy is constrained by the flattening of the x - ray light - curve in its second segment .",
    "figure [ fig : fits ] shows two fits to the radio , optical , and x - ray measurements of the afterglow of grb 051221a obtained with a relativistic jet interacting with a homogeneous circumburst medium and undergoing energy injection at 0.1 days ( to accommodate the flattening of the x - ray light - curves at that epoch ) .",
    "the two fits correspond to a lower limit ( @xmath82 ) and an upper limit ( @xmath83 ) on the density of the ambient medium .",
    "these densities span the allowed range , as shown in the inset by the variation of the reduced @xmath84 with ambient density ( the remaining model parameters were left free to minimize @xmath76 ) . for @xmath85  @xmath86 , which is characteristic for a binary merger occurring in the halo of the host galaxy , the jet initial opening is @xmath87 and the total jet kinetic energy ( after injection )",
    "is @xmath88 erg . for @xmath89  @xmath86 ,",
    "more typical of the interstellar medium , the jet parameters are @xmath90 and @xmath91 erg . for either case , at the epoch of energy injection ( @xmath0 d ) , the incoming ejecta increase the forward - shock energy by a factor of 2 .",
    "also for either case , the jet deceleration and decrease of the relativistic beaming of its emission renders the boundary of the spreading jet visible to the observer at a few days , when the x - ray light - curve decay exhibits a steepening .",
    "given the small angular offset from the center of the host galaxy and the evidence for a slight excess in  above the galactic value , we favor the higher density regime .",
    "the fits obtained using the complete x - ray light curves are not statistically acceptable ( @xmath92 for 43 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this is largely due to the poor fit at the earliest times , when the decay rate of the pre - injection x - ray emission , @xmath93 , is faster than the model prediction .",
    "the post - break decay of the x - ray emission , @xmath94 , indicates that the power - law distribution with energy of the shock - accelerated electrons has an exponent @xmath95 .",
    "together with the average spectral energy index of the x - ray continuum , @xmath96 , this implies that the cooling frequency is below the x - ray band ( in which case @xmath97 ) .",
    "then , the pre - injection decay of the x - ray light - curve should be @xmath98 , which is slower than observed , suggesting a departure from the standard assumptions of the jet model ( e.g. a slightly evolving index @xmath81 or non - uniform ambient medium density ) .",
    "( we refer the reader to @xcite for a compilation of the relations between @xmath99 , and @xmath81 for a variety of models , together with references to the original sources of these relationships . )",
    "statistically acceptable fits ( @xmath100 ) are obtained if only the post - injection data are fit with the jet model , as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : fits ] .",
    "the resulting jet parameters are very similar to those obtained for the energy injection model except that the range of allowed densities extends to larger values , @xmath101 .",
    "the single radio flux measurement may be dominated by the reverse shock component , which depends on the lorentz factor of the ejecta responsible for the energy injection episode . with only a single radio detection ,",
    "the lorentz factor of the incoming ejecta is not well - constrained by the data ( although the injected energy can be constrained by the x - ray data ) .",
    "hence the strength of the reverse shock can not be robustly determined for this burst .",
    "although we have arbitrarily adjusted the ejecta lorentz factor to fit this single data point , it does not allow us to further constrain any of the afterglow parameters , including the density .    in figure",
    "[ fig : jets ] we compare the initial jet angle , @xmath78 , and total jet energy , @xmath102 , for grb051221a with those of two other short bursts , grb050709 and grb050724 , and with several long bursts . for the long bursts ,",
    "we show the best - fit parameters found by @xcite using the same numerical modelling approach used here . for grb050709",
    "we show the range of values obtained for the higher density solution ( @xmath103 ) found by @xcite ; a jet angle larger than most of the long grbs in this sample is required for this case . for grb050724",
    ", we show the limits obtained in paper i using our late - time  observation that provides evidence against any jet break at less than 22 days post - burst .",
    "the jet angle we obtain for grb051221a is consistent with jet angles found for long grbs @xcite , but is significantly lower than that of grb050724 , implying a wide range in jet collimation for short bursts .",
    "we find that grb051221a has a jet energy lower than that of long grbs by an order of magnitude .",
    "the lower energy of the grb051221a jet is consistent with an origin from a binary merger , as in this case the mass of the debris torus formed during the merger is expected to be @xmath104 times lower than that of the torus formed in the collapse of the core of massive stars .",
    "furthermore , the lower limit of circumburst densities allowed for the short grbs 050709 and 051221a is compatible with these bursts occurring outside their host galaxies , as expected from the large kick velocities that neutron stars can acquire at birth .",
    "the flat portion of the light curve of grb051221a is very similar to flat segments seen in many long grbs .",
    "in fact , this light curve looks very similar to that of grb050315 @xcite , with the notable exception that grb051221a has no evidence for a steeply decaying initial segment .",
    "these flat segments have been interpreted as being due to energy injection into the external shock @xcite , but this is the first time that this behavior has been seen in a short grb . as discussed more extensively by @xcite ,",
    "the implication is that the external shock continues to be refreshed hours after the grb itself , either due to continued activity from the central engine or to lower velocity shocks from the initial burst catching up with the decelerating blast wave . by contrast , grb050724 has a large , late bump in the x - ray light curve , interpreted as continued central engine activity ( paper i ) , with the post - flare afterglow returning to the same power - law decay as the pre - flare afterglow .",
    "no flares are seen in the afterglow of grb051221a .",
    "we find that the x - ray afterglow of grb051221a has a break in the light curve between 2.9 and 9.1 days post - burst , from a decay index of 1.2 to @xmath2 , that is consistent with being a jet break .",
    "unfortunately , only upper limits are available in the optical and radio data following this break , so the achromaticity of the break can not be established ; however , the break can be modelled as a jet interacting with an external medium with a density in the range @xmath105  @xmath86 . at the low density limit",
    "we find an initial jet opening angle of 4  and a total jet kinetic energy of @xmath106 ergs . at the higher density limit , which may be more consistent with the small offset of the afterglow from the host galaxy and with the indication of a modest amount of intrinsic x - ray absorption in the host",
    ", we find a jet angle of 8  and jet energy of @xmath107 ergs . we obtain a much wider range of possible circumburst densities than found by @xcite and somewhat larger jet energies ( by a factor of 1.5 - 7 ) , but are in agreement with their results for the remaining jet parameters .",
    "these results indicate that at least some short grbs have afterglows collimated to angles similar to jets in long grbs , though the jet energy can be substantially lower .",
    "together with the lack of a jet break in grb050724 ( paper i ) , this implies a wide range of jet angles for short grbs .",
    "finally , the x - ray light curve of grb051221a has a strong energy injection signature , indicating that the energy of the external shock is increased by a factor of two at about 0.1 days after the burst .",

    "<S> we report the best evidence to date of a jet break in a short gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow , using  and _ swift _  xrt observations of the x - ray afterglow of grb051221a . the combined x - ray light curve , which has three breaks , is similar to those commonly observed in _ swift _  observations of long grbs . a flat segment of the light curve at @xmath0 days after the burst represents the first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of a short grb afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> the last break in the light curve occurs at @xmath1  days post - burst and breaks to a power - law decay index of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as a jet break , with important implications for models of short grbs , since it requires collimation of the afterglow into a jet with an initial opening angle @xmath3 and implies a total jet kinetic energy of @xmath4 erg . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the lack of a jet break in grb050724 , this suggests a wide range in jet collimation in short grbs , with at least some having collimation similar to that found in long grbs , though with significantly lower jet energies . </S>"
