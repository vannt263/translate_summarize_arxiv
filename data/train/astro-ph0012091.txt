    "bloom et al . ( 1999 ) first identified a second component to the optical afterglow of grb 980326 .",
    "this second component grew brighter than the extrapolation of the early afterglow ( which faded as a power law ) around 1 week after the burst , and peaked around 20  30 days after the burst before fading away .",
    "rough spectra taken 2.4 and 28 days after the burst show that the second component was significantly redder than the early afterglow . bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) attributed this behavior to a supernova at a redshift of @xmath2 .",
    "supernovae peak after about @xmath3 days and are significantly redder than afterglows ( blueward of the supernova s spectral peak ) . unfortunately",
    ", neither a redshift nor multiband photometry is available for this afterglow .",
    "reichart ( 1999 ) identified a similar second component to the optical afterglow of grb 970228 , the first burst for which an afterglow was detected .",
    "reichart ( 1999 ) and galama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the light curve of this second component is consistent with the expectation of a supernova at the spectroscopically - measured redshift of this burst ( z = 0.695 ; bloom , djorgovski , & kulkarni 2001 ) .",
    "more convincingly , vrijk photometry of the second component taken near its peak showed that its spectral flux distribution is also consistent with the expectation of a supernova at this redshift : ( 1 ) the spectral flux distribution is very red blueward of the spectral peak and very blue redward of the spectral peak , and ( 2 ) the spectral peak is at the frequency of the spectral peak of a supernova at @xmath4 ( figure 1 ; reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "2000 ; reichart , castander , & lamb 2000 ; reichart , lamb , & castander 2000 ) .",
    "this is the best evidence to date for the grb / sn connection .",
    "the grb / sn connection has recently been challenged by alternative explanations of these observations , called dust echoes ( waxman & draine 2000 ; esin & blandford 2000 ; see also lamb 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "if the progenitors of bursts are massive stars ( see lamb & reichart 2000 for a review of the indirect evidence that bursts are associated with star - forming regions ) , due to the progenitor s wind , the density of the surrounding medium should fall off as @xmath5 out to the radius @xmath6 of the wind termination shock ( chevalier & li 1999 ) . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the density should jump by a factor of @xmath7 , and beyond @xmath6 , the density should remain approximately constant out to great distances ( chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "dust in the vicinity of the burst should be sublimated by uv light from the optical flash ( the reverse shock ; waxman & draine 2000 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be the radius out to which dust is sublimated .",
    "if @xmath8 , and if the dust is sublimated isotropically , the dust should occupy a relatively thin shell at @xmath9 due to the rapidly decreasing density of the circumburst medium with distance .",
    "light that is emitted by the afterglow ( the forward shock ) from a distance that is much less than @xmath1 at an angle @xmath10 relative to the line of sight , is scattered ( esin & blandford 2000 ) or absorbed and thermally re - emitted ( waxman & draine 2000 ; esin & blandford 2000 ) by dust at @xmath11 into the line of sight , and arrives at the observer , arrives with an observer - frame time delay of @xmath12 relative to light that was emitted into the line of sight ( @xmath13 ) and not scattered or absorbed . this dust and light geometry",
    "is depicted in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "waxman & draine ( 2000 ) and esin & blandford ( 2000 ) find that this results in secondary components to the afterglow , called dust echoes , that may peak about 20  30 days after the burst , and that may be significantly redder than the early afterglow , i.e. , that the late - time afterglows of grb 970228 and grb 980326 may in fact be due to dust echoes , and not supernovae .",
    "there are a number of problems with this dust and light geometry .",
    "first of all , @xmath14 pc ( waxman & draine 2000 ) ; however , @xmath6 is probably only a few parsecs ( chavalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "consequently , the dust would probably not occupy a thin shell .",
    "secondly and more importantly , uv light from the optical flash will only sublimate dust within @xmath15 of the line of sight , where @xmath15 is the initial half - opening angle of the jet .",
    "( the lorentz factor @xmath16 of the shocked material in the jet is much greater than @xmath17 when the optical flash occurs . )",
    "if the shock is adiabatic , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density of gas atoms in the circumburst medium , @xmath20 is the isotropic - equivalent energy of the shock , and @xmath21 is observer - frame time ( e.g. , sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) .",

    "radiative shocks yield similar results .",
    "this more realistic dust and light geometry is depicted in the bottom panel of figure 2 .    in this paper",
    "we consider a dust and light geometry of which the dust and light geometry depicted in the bottom panel of figure 2 is a limiting case .",
    "high - energy light from the progenitor may destroy dust ( e.g. , via electrostatic disruption ; draine & salpeter 1979 ; waxman & draine 2000 ) out to a smaller radius .",
    "similarly , irregularities in the progenitor s wind may destroy dust in shocks . in either case",
    ", the dust would be destroyed isotropically .",
    "let @xmath1 instead be the radius out to which dust is destroyed by the progenitor , and let @xmath35 be the radius out to which dust is destroyed by the burst , the optical flash , and/or the afterglow , by whatever dust destruction mechanisms .",
    "if @xmath35 is even twice as great as @xmath1 , and if the jet is oriented along the line of sight , the dust echoes should brighten substantially at a time given by equation ( [ delay ] ) with @xmath11 and @xmath36 , and dim substantially at a time given by equation ( [ delay ] ) with @xmath11 and @xmath37 , since we assume that the jet is bipolar .",
    "if @xmath38 , then the dust echoes `` turn on '' at @xmath39 and `` turn off '' at @xmath40 though they may fade earlier than @xmath41 due to other effects ( see  2 and  3 ) .",
    "the jet may be oriented as much as @xmath42 from the line of sight ( any more and we would not have seen the burst ) .",
    "consequently , the dust echoes may `` turn on '' half of the way as early as @xmath43 and all of the way as late as @xmath44 .",
    "the `` turn off '' time would be similarly affected . the dust and light geometry depicted in the bottom panel of figure 2",
    "is recovered in the limit that @xmath45 .",
    "another dust and light geometry that we consider in this paper is that light from the optical flash , as well as optical light that may be associated with the burst itself , may result in dust echoes .",
    "consequently , dust echoes may be a way to measure the brightness of the optical flash and/or the optical brightness of the burst .    in this paper ,",
    "we model and compute dust echo light curves and spectra for both @xmath46 a few times @xmath1 , and @xmath47 ( in which case dust is destroyed only isotropically ) .",
    "any other case would be fine tuning .",
    "we also model and compute dust echoes resulting from a pulse of light ( i.e. , the optical flash or optical light associated with the burst ) , and an afterglow light curve .",
    "finally , we model and compute dust echo light curves and spectra for both scattered light (  2 ) , and absorbed and thermally re - emitted light (  3 ) .",
    "we find that both types of dust echoes have light curves and spectra that can be distinguished from each other , and from the light curves and spectra of supernovae . in  4",
    ", we re - examine the late - time afterglow of grb 970228 , and find that it can not be explained by a dust echo .",
    "we draw conclusions in  5 .",
    "before modeling the general case of the dust echo of collimated light that is emitted as a function of time ( e.g. , an afterglow ) , we first model the simpler case of the dust echo of an isotropic pulse of light ( e.g. , an optical flash or optical light associated with the burst ) that is emitted from a distance that is much less than @xmath1 .",

    "we show that the choice of @xmath170 has little effect on the light curve and color history of the dust echo of the afterglow in figure 13 .",
    "one aspect of the dust and light geometry that we do not model in this paper is that the afterglow is not emitted from the center of the evacuated region , but rather from the head of the jet , which is moving away from the center ( toward the observer ) at relativistic speeds .",
    "since @xmath189 (  1 ) , the head of the jet reaches the radius @xmath48 at which most of the scattering is occurring at time @xmath190 our model holds as long as most of the light is emitted before some reasonable fraction of @xmath191 . for afterglow light curves like the one described in equation ( [ afterglow ] ) ,",
    "most of the afterglow light is emitted before @xmath162 , by a factor of a few .",
    "consequently , our model only holds as long as @xmath192 , or @xmath193^{-1}\\left(\\frac{e\\theta_{jet } ^2}{10^{52}\\rm{\\,erg}}\\right){\\rm\\,pc}.\\ ] ] however , if the dust echo is dominated by scattered light from the optical flash and/or optical light from the burst , as opposed to light from the afterglow , then the light is obviously emitted long before @xmath191 , and consequently , the model holds for substantially smaller values of @xmath48 as well .",
    "the dust echo from absorbed and thermally re - emitted light is easier to model than the dust echo from scattered light : unlike equation ( [ scat ] ) , the differential cross section for dust absorption has no dependence on @xmath10 : @xmath194 consequently , the light curve of the dust echo of the afterglow is given by @xmath195}d\\left(\\frac{r'}{r}\\right)f_{uv}(t')dt',\\ ] ] where @xmath196 is the bolometric light curve of the dust echo , and @xmath197 is the light curve of the afterglow , integrated over uv values of @xmath69 .",
    "if the re - radiating dust particles had a common temperature @xmath198 , the spectrum of the dust echo would be thermal .",
    "however , the temperature of the dust particles decreases with radius as @xmath199 ( waxman & draine 2000 ) ; consequently , the spectrum should fall off more slowly than a blackbody redward of the spectral peak .",
    "since dust is rapidly sublimated at temperatures @xmath200 k , the spectral peak should occur only at frequencies @xmath201 hz . for a burst at @xmath202 , this is in the k band .",
    "we plot example light curves for different values of @xmath15 in figure 14 .",
    "however , consider the limiting cases for an isotropic pulse of light .",
    "the thermal dust echo has the same limiting cases as the scattered dust echo ( e.g. , equation [ limlc ] ) , except that @xmath203 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath204 , then @xmath205 until @xmath145 , after which @xmath206 until @xmath103 . after this time , @xmath207 . if @xmath208 , then @xmath209 until @xmath103 , after which @xmath210 .",
    "first of all , the late - time afterglow of grb 970228 can not be explained by a thermal dust echo , because its spectral flux distribution ( figure 1 ) peaks between the v and b bands in the source frame , not in or beyond the k band (  3 ) .",
    "secondly , the late - time afterglow of grb 970228 can not be explained by a dust echo due to scattered afterglow light , because its light curve ( e.g. , reichart 1999 ) does not roll over at sufficiently early times for the dust echo to be able to outshine the afterglow when the second component to the light curve peaks , about 20  30 days after the burst (  2.3 ) .",
    "this leaves only the possibility of a dust echo due to scattered light from the optical flash and/or optical light from the burst itself . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have fitted the spectral flux distribution of figure 1 with two power laws , one to the reddest three points and one to the bluest three points .",
    "we find that the spectral index redward of and including the source - frame v band is @xmath211 , and that the spectral index blueward of and including the source - frame b band is @xmath212 .",
    "the corresponding optical depths as a function of the spectral index of the pre - scattered , unextinguished light are given by equation ( [ limspec ] ) with @xmath89 set to 1 .",
    "taking @xmath213 and @xmath214 (  2.1 ) , we find that for an intrinsic spectral index of -1/2 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , and for an intrinsic spectral index of 1/3 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "intrinsic spectral indexes of -1/2 and 1/3 are typical of what one expects for the optical flash blueward and redward of the synchrotron peak , respectively , which one expects to be at optical / nir wavelengths during the optical flash ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ) . in the case of optical light from the burst itself , one expects a spectral index of 1/3 across the optical and nir bands ( e.g. , sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , in either interpretation , the value of @xmath219 is borderline consistent with being physical ( i.e. , non - negative ) , but the rapid transition between @xmath220 or @xmath221 to @xmath222 or @xmath223 or @xmath224 is unphysical .",
    "consequently , we find that the late - time afterglow of grb 970228 can not be explained by a dust echo .    unfortunately , the late - time afterglow of grb 980326 was not sufficiently well sampled to distinguish between a supernova and a dust echo explanation",
    "we have modeled and computed dust echo light curves and spectra for dust and light geometries that are more realistic than had previously been considered . in particular , bursts are very likely to be collimated ( on both theory and energetics grounds ) , and dust may be destroyed by the progenitor , as well as the burst , optical flash , and/or afterglow . also , the optical flash and/or optical light from the burst itself may result in dust echoes . consequently",
    ", dust echoes may be a way to measure the brightness of the optical flash and/or the optical brightness of the burst .",
    "we find that dust echo spectra can be used to distinguish different types of dust echoes from each other , and from supernovae .",
    "for example , thermal dust echoes peak in the source - frame k band , while supernovae peak in the source - frame v or b bands . in the absence of extinction ( e.g. , in the source - frame nir )",
    ", dust echoes due to scattered light are bluer than the pre - scattered light by about 1  1.6 in the spectral index , and consequently , can peak in the source - frame v or b bands , or other nearby bands , depending on the amount of extinction .",
    "however , dust echoes due to scattered light do not peak as sharply as do thermal dust echoes or supernovae .",
    "it is for these reasons that we find that the late - time afterglow of grb 970228 can not be explained by a dust echo .",
    "furthermore , dust echo light curves can often be used to distinguish dust echoes from supernovae .",
    "while dust echoes can peak about 20(1+z ) days after a burst , they also can peak substantially earlier and substantially later .",
    "however , supernovae can peak only at this time .",
    "finally , dust echoes can be used to probe the circumburst environment , and the effects of the progenitor , burst , optical flash , and/or afterglow on this environment .",
    "for example , if the dust echo light curve brightens , levels off for a long time , and then fades , then @xmath59 and dust had not ( yet ) been destroyed along the line of sight .",
    "if the dust echo light curve brightens and fades without leveling off , then @xmath61 and dust had been destroyed along the line of sight .",
    "the time at which the dust echo light curve begins to fade gives you ( most likely ) a degenerate combination of @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "the color of the dust echo , particularly near peak , gives you @xmath91 , and consequently a degenerate combination of @xmath1 and @xmath1821 pc@xmath225 .",
    "the time at which the afterglow light curve rolls over due to lateral expansion of the jet gives you a degenerate combination of @xmath15 and @xmath1821 pc@xmath225 .",
    "consequently , @xmath1 , @xmath15 , and @xmath1821 pc@xmath225 can be separated and solved for .",
    "furthermore , the brightness of the dust echo , particularly near peak , gives you a degenerate combination of @xmath1 , @xmath91 , and the fluence of the pre - scattered , unextinguished light ; consequently , this fluence can be solved for as well .",
    "also , by comparing @xmath91 to the same quantity measured from the afterglow , and to absorption measured in x rays , one can further probe dust destruction along the line of sight , and the metals - to - dust ratio off the line of sight where dust is not destroyed , respectively .",
