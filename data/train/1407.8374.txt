    "the modeling of the time from disease onset or infection ( i.e. , initiating event ) to an outcome of relevance is of considerable importance in studies of the natural history of a disease and in projection of disease burden .",
    "prospective studies which recruit and follow an appropriate cohort of subjects from disease onset to the event of interest are ideal for this purpose . however , these studies are inefficient in terms of resources if the event of interest tends to occur well after disease onset , as is the case for hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) studies of progression to cirrhosis from initial infection .",
    "the alternative is to follow a prevalent cohort of cross - sectionally sampled subjects who , prior to recruitment , have already experienced the initiating event ( e.g. , hcv infection ) but not yet the event of interest ( e.g. , cirrhosis ) .",
    "the left truncated time - to - event data obtained from such a study provide a length - biased sample of the incident population , if sampling is such that an assumption of stationarity over calendar time for the occurrence of the initiating event can be made .",
    "methods for handling both incidence data and such length - biased prevalence data have been well described in the ( bio)statistics literature [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "a less explored situation is the analysis of prevalence data arising from a referral cohort where entry into the cohort is dependent on a subject s residual fraction of time remaining to the event of interest , and inference on the incident population is required .",
    "such data are believed to occur in hcv studies conducted in tertiary care settings , where hcv patients are more likely to be referred to specialist clinics at later stages of disease [ @xcite ] .",
    "the conventional truncation likelihood approach which simply conditions on the time of entry into the cohort does not work here , as the referral time and the time to the event are correlated .",
    "the ignoring of this referral bias has led to higher rates of progression to cirrhosis being reported in studies in specialist clinics compared to those in community - based settings [ @xcite ] .",
    "as cirrhosis linked to hcv infection is a major epidemic of the 21st century , it is extremely important to get an accurate picture of the present and future disease burden facing affected regions in order to inform public health decisions and actions .",
    "the aforementioned type of referral or outcome - dependent sampling bias is particularly difficult to deal with unless a full specification ( up to unknown parameters ) of the probability sampling generating mechanism is provided . in practice , this mechanism will rarely be known and , instead , an approximate formulation of the sampling distribution , which is reasonably robust to misspecification , would be sought .",
    "previously , @xcite proposed a weighted pseudo score [ @xcite , @xcite ] or inverse probability weighted method for estimating the parameters of a weibull regression model for the incubation period from infection to cirrhosis for the community of hepatitis c virus - infected individuals , when there is cirrhosis - related referral bias to the studied prevalent cohort .",
    "the method assumed that everyone in the community would come to clinical attention at or before cirrhosis , so that cirrhosis events are not missed .",
    "therefore , the target community population was assumed `` immortal '' ( in the sense of no competing events ) , and individuals observed in the study sample to have experienced a cirrhotic event were associated with a weight of one in the estimation procedure .",
    "however , for other individuals , @xcite used approximate weights and , therefore , consistency of these estimated weights , and , consequently , the regression parameter estimates of interest , was , in general , not guaranteed .    here",
    "we outline a full likelihood approach to this outcome - dependent referral problem in which the likelihood for the joint distribution of the time to referral and the time to outcome of interest , both from the initiating event , is fully specified . in practice , depending on the dimensionality of the joint parameter space , the full likelihood may be difficult to maximize over both the regression parameters of interest and the parameters associated with the time - to - entry process .",
    "therefore , we also investigate another strategy based on a hybrid two - stage approach that iteratively alternates between estimating the parameters associated with the time - to - outcome distribution ( i.e. , regression and shape parameters ) from a pseudo score with fixed weights and then estimating the parameters associated with the time - to - entry / referral process from the profiled full likelihood assuming the regression and shape parameters are known .",
    "we retain the assumption of an immortal cohort , although this can be relaxed [ @xcite ] .",
    "primarily , we describe the approaches where the time - to - event distribution is assumed weibull .",
    "however , we show how the methods can be extended to the family of parametric time - to - event distributions characterized by the generalized gamma distribution [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , for which the weibull is an important special case .",
    "for individuals in the target / incident population , let the calendar time of the initiating event be @xmath0 and the calendar period of interest for inference on this population be between calendar times @xmath1  and  @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 . clinical observation of an individual will be left truncated at their time of referral to the clinic which is the time of entry into the cohort for those referred before @xmath4 .",
    "let the time intervals from @xmath0 to potential referral and to the event of interest be @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and denote by @xmath7 the @xmath8 vector of explanatory variables .",
    "we assume that the time - to - event @xmath6 from @xmath0 in the incident population comes from a weibull distribution with support on the positive real line and with positive shape and scale parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 for given @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a vector of regression parameters associated with @xmath14 .",
    "more explicitly , the density and distribution functions of @xmath6 from an initiating event calendar time @xmath15 , and given the vector of explanatory variables @xmath12 , are @xmath16 t^{\\gamma-1}$ ] and @xmath17 $ ] , respectively . as there is no dependence on the actual value of @xmath18 in these functions , we simplify the notation for the density and distribution functions of @xmath6 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "additionally , we assume , as is done for length - biased sampling problems , that within the calendar period @xmath21 $ ] , the rate of occurrence of the initiating event remains constant .",
    "the independence of the distribution of @xmath6 from when its initiating event occurred and the stationarity of the initiating event process within the calendar period of interest are together referred to as the steady state or equilibrium condition [ @xcite ] .",
    "an individual is assumed to be included in the studied prevalent cohort if @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the indicator variable denoting selection / inclusion .",
    "in addition to the assumption that selected patients will experience the event of interest and be referred prior to the time of the event , we assume the following for the individuals in the target population .    [ assumption1 ] the truncation ( or potential referral or entry ) time of an individual is always less than the time to outcome and so @xmath24 .",
    "[ assumption2 ] for a known vector @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 , and unknown mixture probability vector @xmath30 with @xmath31 , the distribution of @xmath5 given @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) is a mixture of independent uniform random variables with support in the interval @xmath34 , density function @xmath35 and cumulative distribution function @xmath36    the form chosen for this conditional density reflects the belief that the residual fraction , @xmath37 , of time remaining to the event of interest ( or , alternatively , the fraction , @xmath38 , of event time elapsed ) drives whether a subject is referred [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is constructed as a mixture of uniforms so as to allow flexibility in the shape of distribution that can be captured . a notable feature of the random variable @xmath39 ( for @xmath40 ) , corresponding to the fraction of time elapsed to the event of interest , is its independence from @xmath6 ( see theorem in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "we will subsequently investigate the impact of misspecifying the partitioning of @xmath41 on results obtained",
    ".    for selected subjects ( @xmath42 ) , denote by @xmath43 the censoring time from entry into the cohort , and let @xmath44 be the observed follow - up time until the outcome event or censoring , with @xmath45 the `` right censoring '' indicator taking the value @xmath46 when uncensored . as the calendar period of interest for inference on this population is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , then for selected subjects , @xmath47 .",
    "that is , follow - up beyond @xmath2 is not planned .",

    "these two steps are iterated until convergence of the estimates for @xmath89 to @xmath119 .",
    "initially the inclusion probabilities @xmath116 are all assumed to take the value @xmath46 and , therefore , the initial estimate of @xmath115 is from the standard ( unweighted ) weibull regression model .",

    "for simplicity in interpretation of the various simulation results to be presented , we assume everyone in the community experienced the initiating event at the same calendar date and those whose truncation time was less than @xmath148 years entered the referral cohort . administrative right censoring of sampled subjects occurred at @xmath149 years from the calendar date of the initiating event .",

    "both approaches produce consistent estimates of the parameters from the weibull model and the sampling mechanism when the time - to - event distribution was weibull .",
    "as expected , more efficient estimates of the shape and regression parameters were obtained from the full likelihood approach than the hybrid pseudo score / profile likelihood approach .",
    "similar estimated standard errors were obtained from both approaches for the corresponding estimates of @xmath117 .",

    "although a likelihood ratio test on 1 degree of freedom ( @xmath180 ) rejected the weibull in favor of the generalized gamma , the maximum likelihood estimates for the regression parameters of interest were similar to those previously obtained ( @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) and the estimate of the proportion of infected individuals referred to in the last one eighth of their cirrhosis period was again @xmath176 .",

    ", we found that the differences between the assumption of a generalized gamma and that of a weibull for the time - to - event distribution was noticeable only in the upper tails of the estimated marginal time - to - event distributions of the edinburgh hcv community , past the actual largest observed time to cirrhosis ( i.e. , an uncensored event of @xmath179 years ) seen from the edinburgh royal infirmary s liver clinic .",
    "similar to the marginal kaplan  meier curve presented under the assumption that the time - to - event distribution is weibull , figure  [ fig2 ] also displays the equivalent kaplan  meier curve under the assumption of the generalized gamma , and thus provides an illustration of the discrepancy between curves being evident in the upper tail beyond @xmath179 years .",
    "[ discuss ] a weighted pseudo score method is commonly suggested for handling response - biased observations , where specifying the full likelihood is difficult . provided that the inverse probability weights can be consistently estimated , then consistency of regression parameter estimates will be achieved using this approach . however , if the full likelihood is available , then it is generally preferable to use it to estimate the parameters of interest , as these estimates will be more efficient than those obtained from the weighted pseudo score method .",
    "this preference for the full likelihood over the weighted pseudo score method also holds when the time - to - event distribution is misspecified . in the context of misspecification",
    ", we would advocate fitting the more flexible generalized gamma time - to - event distribution ( or an alternative such as a semi - parametric piecewise exponential - type distribution ) , instead of the weibull , in order to get better estimates of the marginal progression rates .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that a by - product of the weighted pseudo score approach , which makes it appealing , is the straightforward estimation of the total incident population size .",
    "this is not directly available ( although calculable ) from the full likelihood approach . in public health terms ,",
    "estimation of the total number of hcv carriers and the `` true '' impact of covariates on hcv progression are key .    in the informative entry time problem addressed here",
    ", we were able to develop both a full likelihood approach and a hybrid two - stage pseudo score / profile likelihood approach for outcome - dependent referral where sampling is dependent on the residual fraction of time remaining to develop the event .",
    "under correct specification of the referral mechanism , we found that the full likelihood approach was indeed more efficient than the hybrid approach in the estimation of the regression parameters of interest and the shape parameter .",
    "the former approach , however , appeared to be more susceptible to bias if the outcome - dependent referral mechanism was misspecified through a coarser representation and the `` information content '' of the data ( in terms of number of referrals , number of events and length of follow - up ) was low .",
    "in the situation where the `` information content '' is considered to be relatively high , it perhaps would be more appealing to adopt the hybrid method over the full likelihood approach , as it could be significantly more robust and the decrease in the resulting efficiency may still be acceptable .",
    "in general , we would recommend that when using either approach , and , in particular , the full likelihood one , analysts should begin by specifying a reasonably fine partitioning of the @xmath41 which can then be refined to obtain a more parsimonious representation of the referral mechanism .",
    "this strategy would allow checking for sensitivity / robustness to misspecification of the referral mechanism .",
    "however , convergence issues may arise if the partitioning is too fine or if the selection probability for a subject is too small .",
    "we have not investigated these convergence issues here .",
    "the application of these methods to data from the edinburgh royal infirmary s hepatitis c virus liver clinic allowed us to characterize realistically the extent of edinburgh s hcv epidemic prior to 2000 in terms of progression rate to cirrhosis and the impact of alcohol consumption and age at hcv infection on this progression .",
    "standard survival analysis methods severely overestimated the 30-year progression rate and underestimated the relative risks for the explanatory variables .    in our present analysis of the edinburgh hcv data",
    ", we assumed that the time of infection was known .",
    "this simplifying assumption was thought reasonable in our case , since even when the times of hcv infection in the edinburgh liver clinic were uncertain , this uncertainty tended to be only in the determination of the exact date of infection within a calendar year or two . as the mean incubation period to cirrhosis",
    "is several orders of magnitude greater than the size of this interval , we expect that , for the analysis of our data set , the added uncertainty in estimation due to this imprecision in timing of infection will be inconsequential",
    ". however , in other applications where the timing of the initiation event ( e.g. , cancer or hiv infection onset ) is known only to within an interval , which may be quite large , and where either the mean time to the event of interest ( e.g. , death or aids ) or the mean follow - up time are not of an appreciably long enough length compared to the mean width of these intervals , the implications for analyses of assuming - known initiation time ( e.g. , by choosing the mid - point of the interval ) can be major . @xcite",
    "discuss an approach to account for unknown onset times , when the time of onset is known only to be in an interval , say , @xmath183 .",
    "this approach requires the specification of a density , say , @xmath184 , for the time of infection ( e.g. , a uniform distribution ) over the interval @xmath183 .",
    "the likelihood to be optimized over the parameters then takes the form @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the likelihood contribution from the @xmath101th subject , given known infection time , and the density , @xmath187 , for this subject s time of infection may be specified up to an unknown parameter vector , @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , it can be seen that this approach can be adapted to our situation where the sampling is dependent on the residual fraction of time left to developing the event of interest and the onset time is known only to within an interval . however , careful thought is required on the most appropriate form for @xmath184 .",
    "for example , in hcv studies where the majority of subjects are injecting drug users and",
    "when time of hcv infection is unknown , there is evidence to suggest that infection occurs earlier in a subject s injecting career [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .    future application of these methods to the hcv epidemic in scotland , more generally , is planned with health protection scotland .",
    "health protection scotland has developed a clinical database on referrals of hcv patients to liver clinics across all regions of scotland .",
    "application of our methodology should provide regional estimates for the number of hcv carriers in scotland and will allow us to examine if the `` true '' impact of covariates ( such as age at hcv infection and heavy alcohol use ) are stable across regions although the covariate distribution may differ between regions .",
