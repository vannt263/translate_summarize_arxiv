    "fundamental questions of stellar astrophysics suffer from a lack of truly empirical evidence when it comes to stars with the highest masses both on and evolved off the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "recent models maintain that in the early universe , the initial - mass function ( imf ) was top - heavy and that primordial ( population iii ) stars were extremely massive , with masses from @xmath6100 to @xmath61000 m@xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to that , recent studies have put forward both theoretical and observational arguments that under present - day conditions , an imf cut - off occurs around @xmath8 m@xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , even in the local group very massive stars remain poorly characterized , and it so far remains uncertain at what mass an upper cut - off really occurs , if at all .",
    "the least model - dependent and thus most reliable way to directly measure stellar masses is by keplerian orbits in binary systems . in the past years",
    ", studies of very massive binaries have yielded the somewhat surprising results that the most massive stars known are to be found not among o - type stars , but among a very luminous subtype of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , the so - called wn5 - 7h ( or ha ) stars .",
    "these hydrogen - rich wn stars are young , unevolved objects rather than `` classical '' wr stars , which are usually identified with evolved , helium - burning , massive stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wn5 - 7h stars mimic classical , i.e. evolved , core helium burning wr stars because their extreme luminosity , a result of their very high masses , drives a dense and fast wind which gives rise to wr - like emission lines . due to the rarity of very massive stars in general and of very massive binaries in particular ,",
    "only few massive systems have been `` weighed '' so far . in order of increasing mass ,",
    "these are the galactic wolf - rayet stars wr22 ( 72 m@xmath7 for the wn7h component @xcite , although @xcite derive only 55 m@xmath7 ) , wr20a ( 83 and 82 m@xmath7 for both wn6 ha components ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , wr21a ( minimum mass @xmath9 m@xmath7 for the o3if / wn6 primary ; @xcite ) , ngc3603-a1 ( 116 and 89 m@xmath7 for both wn6 ha components ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , these very high masses impressively underline the extraordinary nature of wn5 - 7h stars .    in a recent , intense survey of 41 of the 47 known wnl stars in the lmc , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s08 ) used 2m - class telescopes to obtain repeated , intermediate - quality ( r=1000 , s / n@xmath680 ) spectra in order to assess the binary status of the 41 targets from radial - velocity ( rv ) variations .",
    "s08 identified four new binaries containing wn5 - 7h stars , bringing the total number of known wnlh binaries in the lmc to nine .",
    "for one of the previously known binaries , r145 (= hde 269928",
    "= bat99 - 119 = brey 90 ) , the preliminary 25.4-day period reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m89 ) could not be confirmed , but neither could a coherent period be established from the rv data of this study alone .",
    "therefore , we combined s08 s rvs with those published by m89 , and with previously unpublished polarimetry .",
    "it was only after the combination that we were able to find the true orbital period of this system as well as other orbital parameters .    from both its rv and ew variations and its high x - ray luminosity , s08 identified another wn6h star , r144 ( hd 38282 = bat99 - 118 = brey 89 ) , to be a binary candidate , although m89 had identified this star as probably single .",
    "in terms of spectral type , r144 is almost a perfect clone of r145 ; however , at the @xmath6same bolometric correction and after allowing for differential interstellar extinction , r144 is @xmath60.5 mag brighter than r145 .",
    "indeed , @xcite , using atmosphere models without iron - line blanketing , derived a spectroscopic mass in excess of 100 m@xmath7 , and a luminosity of log@xmath10 for r144 , which makes this star one of the most luminous wr stars known .",
    "new , updated models most likely would yield an even higher mass and luminosity , making r144 the most luminous main - sequence ( ms ) object in the local group . since we also have unpublished polarimetry for r144 , we have revisited this object as well , using the spectroscopic data obtained by s08 .    in the present paper",
    ", we will report the results of this study . in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we will briefly describe the observations and the data reduction . in section [ section3 ]",
    ", we will describe the analysis of our data and present the results .",
    "the paper is then summarized in section [ section4 ] .",
    "the spectroscopic observations are described in detail in s08 .",
    "we briefly recapitulate here that long - slit spectrographs attached to ground - based , southern , 2m - class telescopes were used .",
    "data were obtained in three observing seasons between 2001 and 2003 to maximize the time coverage , and were carried out during 13 runs at 6 different telescopes . the spectral coverage varied from one instrument to another , but",
    "all spectrographs covered the region from 4000 to 5000  , thereby encompassing the strategic emission line heii @xmath114686    data were reduced in the standard manner using noao - iraf , and corrected for systematic shifts among different observatories ( see s08 for more details ) . the achieved linear dispersion varied from 0.65  / pixel to 1.64  / pixel , but all data were uniformly rebinned to 1.65  / pixel , thereby yielding a conservative 3-pixel resolving power of @xmath12 . the achieved signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio was @xmath6 120 per resolution element for both stars , as measured in the continuum region between 5050 and 5350  .",
    "additional rv data for r144 and r145 were taken from m89 , to which we refer for more details on the data acquisition and reduction .",
    "linear polarimetry in white light was obtained during a total of six observing runs between october 1988 and may 1990 at the 2.2 m telescope of the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) near san juan , argentina , with vatpol ( @xcite ) , and at the eso / mpg-2.2 m telescope at la silla , chile , with pisco ( @xcite ) .",
    "rca gaas phototubes were employed in both cases .",
    "exposure times were typically 15 minutes per data point .",
    "appropriate standard stars were taken to calibrate the polarization angle and the zero level , and exposures of the adjacent sky were obtained to correct for the background count rates .",
    "the polarimetric data were calibrated the usual way ( e.g. @xcite ) . since thompson scattering is wavelength - independent ( i.e. grey ) , and",
    "the differences between the sensitivity curves of the respective detectors are small , no correction for the different passbands was deemed necessary .",
    "however , a small instrumental offset between pisco and vatpol was found in polarization ; we therefore have added @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the pisco data to match the vatpol data , on average .",
    "the final polarimetric data for r144 and r145 are listed in tables [ tablepol118 ] and [ tablepol119 ] , respectively .",
    "statistics reveal that r144 displays a small but significant scatter ( standard deviation ) about their mean values in both stokes parameters , 0.052% and 0.063% in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ; by comparison , the quoted error per data point is only @xmath6half this .",
    "however , in figure [ poldata118 ] one can clearly see that over the observation period of @xmath615 days , the polarization in stokes-@xmath16 increases constantly by @xmath60.2% ( i.e. @xmath6seven times the quoted error per data point ) , while stokes-@xmath15 also shows systematic variability , which is a strong indication that some coherent process is involved , e.g. a ( longer - period ) binary motion .",
    "r145 , on the other hand , is much more variable ; the scatter is 0.26% and 0.20% about their mean values , respectively , in @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with well defined and coherent variability episodes ( figure [ poldata119 ] ) .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the difference in the systemic velocities obtained from heii @xmath114686 and @xmath115411 amounts to @xmath655 kms@xmath17 .",
    "it is well known in the literature that systemic velocities obtained from emission lines of wr stars display a systematic red - shift with respect to the true systemic velocity ( e.g. of the host galaxy of the wr star , see e.g. s08 ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by radiative - transfer effects ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , it is noteworthy that different lines of the same ionic species will display significantly different systemic velocities .",
    "cross - verification with r144 yielded the very same effect with roughly the same shift ( @xmath650 kms@xmath17 ) between the systemic velocities obtained from the two heii lines , and shows that the effect is indeed real .",
    "however , in wr+o binaries , heii emission lines are prone to suffer from profile variations due to excess emission arising in the wind - wind collision ( wwc ) region ; therefore they might not yield the correct , but a more or less distorted rv curve ( and with this , wrong orbital parameters ) .",
    "indeed r145 displays strong excess emissions , and because r145 is a very eccentric system , the strength of the excess emission varies considerably over the orbital phase . from simple considerations , we expect ( and find ; see section [ wwc ] for a more detailed discussion ) the excess emission to be strongest near periastron .",
    "this , however , means that the rvs derived from line profiles of both heii @xmath114686 and @xmath115411 are most affected at an orbital phase where the rv data points have the most importance for the orbital fit , namely when the rv of the wn component changes quickly from maximum redshifted to maximum blueshifted velocities , around periastron passage .    to somewhat reduce the effect of such line - profile variations over the orbital cycle , we have employed the iterative cross - correlation method described in s08 . in fact ,",
    "@xcite have shown that using bisectors to measure the line center yields perfectly similar results to those obtained by iterative cross - correlation ( with bisectors yielding a slightly larger scatter ) .",
    "thus , the iterative form of cross - correlation is relatively robust against the influence even of strong and variable wwc excess emissions .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated how the emission - line strength changes over the orbital cycle due to the variable strength of the excess emissions .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ews ) of both heii @xmath114686 and @xmath115411 , normalized them by the mean value around apastron ( phase interval [ 0.4;0.6 ] ) when the wwc excess emissions supposedly are weakest , and folded these relative ews into the orbital phase ( for @xmath18 days ; see figure [ compew ] ) .",
    "despite the fact that heii @xmath114686 suffers more from the increased wwc excess emission at periastron ( almost twice compared to heii @xmath115411 ) , the orbital solutions the respective lines are fully consistent with each other , the only difference being the redshifted systemic velocity of heii @xmath115411 , as discussed above .    as an additional test , we have used rvs obtained from gauss - fitting the weak and narrow , highly - ionized niv @xmath114058 emission line .",
    "as before , our results were combined with those published by m89 using the systematic shift between the two data sets obtained from the orbital fitting of heii @xmath114686 ( @xmath19 of 10 kms@xmath17 ; see table [ orbitalelements ] ) . due to its fluorescent origin from ultra - violet transitions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the niv @xmath114058 line is commonly regarded as very robust against wwc excess emissions , and usually yields rvs which follow best the true orbital motion of the wr star . in figure [ compheii ]",
    "we have plotted the orbital solution obtained from heii @xmath114686 .",
    "overplotted are the combined rvs obtained from niv @xmath114058 , shifted by + 110 kms@xmath17 to match the mean velocity of the orbital solution . while the scatter of the data points is expectedly large ( see section [ supertemplate ] ) , which makes it impossible to use this line for a sensible orbital fit , the points do follow the orbital motion and , more importantly , do not show a significantly different rv _",
    "amplitude_. even if this is not fully conclusive evidence , it is a very plausible indicator that the orbital parameters obtained from the rvs of the two heii lines are reliable .",
    "moreover , since the orbital solutions were obtained from a combined set of spectroscopic and polarimetric data , and the latter is not affected by line - profile variations , the influence of wwc excess emission is further attenuated .",
    "since niv @xmath114058 does not suffers from radiative - transfer effects like the heii lines , and is not blended , it also yields a relatively precise estimate of the true systemic velocity of the wr star ; @xcite found a small , negative shift for galactic wn7/wn8 stars , @xmath20 kms@xmath17 ( standard deviation ) . using the mean velocity of the niv @xmath114058 line as an estimate of the true systemic velocity of the binary system , we thus obtain @xmath21 kms@xmath17 .",
    "this value is just inconsistent with the reported systemic velocity of the lmc , @xmath22 kms@xmath17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "either for some reason , niv @xmath114058 has a rather exceptional negative rv , or r145 indeed has a slightly negative systemic velocity with respect to the lmc .    based on our error - estimation method , the error for the inclination angle @xmath0 was found to be 7@xmath5 and 6@xmath5 for the two lines",
    "heii @xmath114686 and @xmath115411 , respectively . choosing a higher cut - off value than",
    "the 5% used will of course lead to a larger error on @xmath0 ( and all other parameters ) , but the @xmath23 deteriorates very quickly when the inclination angle varies by much more than 10 to 15@xmath5 , and the discrepancies between the fit and the data become noticeably large .",
    "however , it is well known among polarimetrists that , due to an asymmetric error distribution , there is a bias of the polarimetric determination of the inclination angle towards higher values than the true value of @xmath0 ; this bias is more pronounced , the lower the true inclination angle and the lower the data quality is ( in terms of both the number of available data points and their respective individual errors ) ; see e.g. aspin et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , simmons et al . ( 1982 ) or , more recently , wolinski & dolan ( 1994 ) for a comprehensive discussion of this issue .",
    "thus , our analysis is bound to _",
    "_ over__estimate the true value of @xmath0 , which means that the true inclination angle is more likely lower than @xmath24 , rendering the resulting masses even higher and less plausible ( see below ) . if , on the other hand , we were to force a fit with the inclination angle fixed at @xmath25 , the resulting @xmath23 would more than double compared to the best - fit value . unless the orbital period is wrong altogether , it is thus unlikely that the inclination angle is that high .",
    "this is most unfortunate , since this result rules out the possibility of r145 being an eclipsing system , so that photometry does not seem to be a viable alternative to reveal core eclipses , although atmospheric eclipses may still be possible .",
    "on the other hand , we are not aware of any existing or published photometry of r145 , so that we have no possibility to verify the polarimetric result .",
    "we will therefore adopt the average value of @xmath1 ( quadratic error ) for the rest of the paper , and discuss the consequences for the stellar masses further below .",
    "given the great importance of an accurate determination of the inclination angle , we strongly encourage that more high - quality data be collected .      as both s08 and m89 reported , no trace of the companion s absorption lines could be found in the individual spectra .",
    "it would be fairly obvious if the secondary were an emission - line star as well , like e.g. in the case of ngc3603-a1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is already an indication for the secondary being considerably fainter than the primary , and most likely an absorption - line o star .    in a first attempt to isolate the spectrum of the companion , we shifted all spectra of r145 into the frame of reference of the wr component , and co - added them using their respective s / n values as weights to obtain a high - quality , mean wr spectrum .",
    "this mean was then subtracted from each individual spectrum , thereby removing most of the wr star s emission lines ; thus , if any o - star absorptions were visible , we expected to find them in the individual residual spectra .",
    "however , there was no obvious trace ; any absorption - like structure was essentially lost in the noise .",
    "we therefore adopted a modified version of the method developed by @xcite , the so - called `` shift - and - add '' method .",
    "originally it consists in shifting all spectra into the frame of reference of the wr star and subtracting the mean ( which we have done ) , shifting the residual spectra back into the frame of reference of the o star , and co - adding all shifted residuals to obtain a cleaner mean spectrum of the o star .",
    "while this method can be used iteratively to obtain ever better disentangled spectra of the wr and the o components , respectively , its caveat is obvious : one has to know the orbit of the o star , otherwise one can not shift the residuals into its frame of reference .",
    "since we had neither the companion s orbit nor any , even weak , spectral signatures of absorption lines , we had to assume that @xmath0 ) the companion is indeed an o star and not another emission - line star ( as suggested by the orbital behaviour of the emission - line profiles ) , and @xmath26 ) the companion moves in perfect anti - phase ( i.e. phase shift of @xmath27 ) to the wr orbit .",
    "the orbit of the o star can then be reconstructed by mirroring the orbital motion of the wr star .",
    "to do so , we considered the _",
    "motion @xmath28 of the wr star with respect to its systemic ( zero ) velocity , as measured at two dates @xmath29 , and multiplied it by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 the mass ratio of the binary system , to obtain the corresponding @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , if the wr star changes its rv by 50 kms@xmath17 , and if , say , @xmath33 , then the o star s rv has to change by @xmath34 kms@xmath17 in the same time interval [ @xmath35 .",
    "i.e. in perfect anti - phase . to reduced the influence of errors on the individual @xmath36 measures , we used the orbital solution of the wr star as obtained above from the heii @xmath114686 line .",
    "we emphasize that because this is an entirely _ differential _ approach , one does * not * need to know the systemic velocity of either the wr star or the o star ( which must be different from that of the wr star , not least because most of the wr emissions display a systematic redshift ; see above ) .    with this tentative @xmath37 curve for the o star , the individual residual spectra ( i.e. , after wr subtraction )",
    "can now be shifted into the tentative frame of reference of the o star .",
    "co - adding of the thus shifted residuals should make the o star s absorption spectrum appear with greater clarity , _ if one has the correct value for @xmath38 _ , because the co - added average spectrum has a higher s / n .",
    "one can then iterate the procedure : the mean o - star spectrum is subtracted from the original spectra , and the residuals are used to construct a `` cleaner '' mean wr - star spectrum , i.e. one which now is relatively free from any o - star absorption lines . with the new mean wr spectrum , the procedure to obtain the o - star spectrum is repeated , and so forth .    but how can one know that a chosen @xmath38 is the right one ? if the residual spectra are shifted by exactly their correct @xmath37 value , the co - added absorption lines will have maximum depths , because they are co - added while in perfect superposition . if , however , a wrong mass ratio was assumed ( too large or too small ) , then the co - added absorption lines will be shallower , because the individual spectra are not shifted into the correct frame of reference in which they should stand still over time . thus , when using different tentative values for @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 , which is immediately given by @xmath40 ) and measuring the depth of a given , co - added absorption line , the depth of the line will go through a maximum when plotted versus @xmath38 .",
    "the only challenge is to wisely choose the o - star absorption lines one measures , given that the wn star in r145 shows strong emission lines .",
    "we opted for the two lines heii @xmath114200 and @xmath114542 , because wn emissions at these positions are relatively weak and because these are the strongest he lines in a hot , early - type o star , the anticipated companion .",
    "we carried out the `` shift - and - add '' exercise scanning through values of @xmath38 so that the ( intuitively more easily understandable ) @xmath39 values range from @xmath34 kms@xmath17 ( i.e. , the o star is less massive than the wr star and moves _ in phase _ with it , which is of course unphysical , but it gives a strong constraint on the zero level of the measured absorption - line depth ) to @xmath41 kms@xmath17 ( i.e. , the o star is @xmath42 times less massive than the wr star and moves in _ anti - phase _ with it , just as it should if it was its true companion ) , depending on the line .",
    "thus , we also considered the case were the o star is actually more massive than the wr star , i.e. it moves with a smaller rv amplitude than the wr star .    from the co - added , mean o - star spectrum ,",
    "the depths of the absorption - lines were obtained by hand using the eso - midas task get / gcur .",
    "continuum values on either side of the absorption were averaged and subtracted from the peak value such as to obtain positive values for the line strength , with deeper lines yielding larger values .",
    "results are shown in figure [ lineshifts ] for the heii @xmath114200 and the heii @xmath114542 absorptions , respectively , where measured line depths versus the respective @xmath39 value are plotted .",
    "the asymmetry of the curve might be caused by @xmath0 ) an intrinsic absorption - line asymmetry due to a modest p cygni profile in the o star spectrum , or @xmath26 ) a residual emission of the wr star due to imperfect subtraction .",
    "both effects will distort the curve because the intensity is not the same on both sides of the absorption - line center .",
    "asymmetry is particularly visible in the data for the heii @xmath114200 line ; however , whether this comes from an intrinsic asymmetry in the o - star absorption or is related to imperfect wr subtraction , can not be determined .    in order to determine the value for @xmath39 at which the absorption - line depth was maximal ,",
    "a parabola was fitted to the data ( see figure [ lineshifts ] )",
    ". comparing heii @xmath114200 and heii @xmath114542 immediately reveals that the strong asymmetry in heii @xmath114200 leads to a position of the global maximum which is different from the value obtained from heii @xmath114542 , @xmath43 versus @xmath44 kms@xmath17 . while technically , these two values are consistent with each other within their respective errors , we re - fitted both sets of points considering only the central cusp ( fit shown in solid line ) .",
    "we now obtained @xmath45 and @xmath46 kms@xmath17 for heii @xmath114200 and heii @xmath114542 , respectively .",
    "since the error on the result for heii @xmath114200 is @xmath47 times larger than for heii @xmath114542 , this leads to a very small relative weight ( @xmath48 ) , if one were to calculate a @xmath49-weighted average .",
    "furthermore , s08 reported that due to the lack of arc - comparison lines towards the blue end of their spectra , rv scatter was found to be larger than in the central region of the spectra ( i.e. , around heii @xmath114686 ) .",
    "therefore , we did not calculate a weighted mean shift but rather entirely relied on the value obtained from the heii @xmath114542 absorption .",
    "the second iteration yielded only a marginal change , @xmath50 kms@xmath17 .",
    "the final , resulting o - star spectrum for the two absorption lines is shown in figure [ ostarlines ] .",
    "strong artifacts are present , possibly due to imperfect wr subtraction , not least because the wr emission lines display phase - dependent excess emission due to wind - wind collisions ( see section [ wwc ] ) . moreover , upon subtraction of the mean wr spectrum , slight misalignments between the wr mean and an individual spectrum will generate pseudo p cyg profiles in the residuals , whose strength and width sensitively depend on the amount of misalignment ; at least partially , these artifacts are reduced by the averaging process . unfortunately , however , this effectively inhibits one to apply this method on the heii @xmath114686 emission line , which would be much better visible than any absorption lines , should the secondary be an emission - line ( e.g. an extreme of / wn6 ) star as well .",
    "the absorption lines of the putative secondary are very faint ; the depth of the heii @xmath114542 absorption line is @xmath60.013 in units of relative flux , its @xmath51 m   ( error estimated from results obtained for different continuum positions ) , and its @xmath52  , the latter being consistent with what is to be expected from a typical o star . given the extremely high s / n obtained in the co - added spectra ( s / n @xmath6800 ) , it is thus not implausible that these lines are indeed real .",
    "however , the low spectral resolution of our data , the frequent rebinning during the shift - and - add , errors in the orbital solution of the wr star , and noise will degrade the relatively narrow absorption lines of the o star , so the true depth might be somewhat larger . as an estimate , we adopt a degradation of the depth by a third , i.e. the true depth is 1.5 times larger than measured , i.e @xmath60.02 relative flux .",
    "comparing with the depth of the absorption lines heii @xmath114200 and @xmath114542 in single , early - type o stars , which are typically 0.12 and 0.16 in continuum units , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we then find that the companion is diluted by a factor of at least @xmath68 ; the wn6h component is thus at least @xmath62.2 mag brighter than the o star .",
    "the same exercise can be repeated for the ew .",
    "@xcite report a typical @xmath53 , i.e. ew(4542 ) @xmath54 m   for early - type o stars , with little variation between the spectral types . using the above measure",
    ", we thus obtain a dilution factor @xmath55 , consistent with what was derived above . at @xmath6same bolometric correction",
    ", this light ratio directly translates into a luminosity ( and hence , mass ) ratio . using @xmath56 with @xmath57 yields the mass ratio of the system @xmath58 .      to determine the absolute dynamical masses of both components in r145 ,",
    "we have averaged the values of the orbital parameters obtained for the two heii lines @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( cf . table [ orbitalelements ] ) . with the usual relations",
    "@xmath61    and @xmath62    where @xmath63 is in days , @xmath64 in kms@xmath17 , masses @xmath65 in solar units , and taking the values @xmath66 kms@xmath17 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 days , and @xmath69 kms@xmath17 from the heii @xmath114542 absorption ( see above ) , we obtain minimum masses @xmath70 m@xmath7 for the primary and @xmath71 m@xmath7 for the secondary . thus",
    ", the mass ratio is @xmath72 , consistent with the value that was derived from the absorption - line strength ( see above ) .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , minimum masses are already very high and consistent with r145 s absolute visual magnitude . from the bat99 catalogue , @xmath73 mag and @xmath74 . adopting r144 s @xmath75 ( @xcite ) for r145 , we obtain @xmath76 mag . with a distance modulus of @xmath77 mag for the lmc and the relation @xmath78",
    ", it follows that @xmath79 mag , i.e. slightly brighter than that of wr20a , @xmath80 mag ( @xcite ) ,    in wr20a , which consists of two equally massive , and hence equally bright , components , each one of the components has @xmath81 mag . since the light from r145 is entirely dominated by the wn6h component , the brightness difference between the wn6h component in r145 and one of the wn6 ha components in wr20 is @xmath60.9 mag ; this brightness difference directly translates into a luminosity ( and hence , mass ) ratio .",
    "the flux ratio between the primary in r145 and one wn6 ha component of wr20a is thus @xmath62.3 ; assuming the same bolometric correction and @xmath82 yields a mass ratio of @xmath61.5 , i.e. @xmath83 . a different exponent in the mass - luminosity relation is possible , but covered by the large uncertainties on the stellar mass anyway , as are slight changes in reddening , intrinsic colors , and distance modulus .    at first glance , this result is in excellent agreement with the minimum mass obtained from the orbital motion .",
    "however , now the inclination angle has to be taken into account .",
    "the fit to the polarimetric data returns @xmath1 , @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the true masses of the binary components are higher by a factor @xmath85 , at least 300 and 125 m@xmath7 , respectively . not only would such high masses be unprecedented , but r145 would also be severely underluminous for its mass . if the correct inclination angle were closer to 60@xmath5 , the masses would still be @xmath61.5 times higher , but then the resulting absolute masses would be roughly ( if just ) consistent with the intrinsic brightness of the system",
    ". however , the @xmath23 of the fit quickly deteriorates if the inclination angle is 10 to 15@xmath5 larger than the optimum value ( see above ) , so there seems to be no margin for a significantly higher inclination angle .",
    "unless we accept that the polarimetry yields an entirely wrong inclination angle ( which then would question the validity of the orbital solution altogether ) , the easiest way out is that the shift - and - add method is at fault , and that the secondary has a smaller rv amplitude , i.e. the mass ( and hence , luminosity ) ratio is smaller ( a _ larger _",
    "rv amplitude of the secondary would not remedy the situation , because the resulting system mass would be even higher , if everything else remained the same . ) then , however , the question arises why the secondary is not visible in the composite spectrum , let alone during the shift - and - add process .",
    "an explanation might be that the secondary itself is massive ( luminous ) enough to display a significant stellar wind , and resembles e.g. an extreme of / wn6 star .",
    "the heii @xmath114686 emission of such a star would be weak enough to be dominated by the much stronger line of the wn6h component , and possibly even be drowned out by excess emission arising from wind - wind collision in the residual spectra ( see section [ wwc ] ) ; on the other hand , the heii @xmath114200 and @xmath114542 absorptions could ( at least partially ) be filled up by wind emission .",
    "the latter would seriously affect the usefulness of measuring the depth or the ew of the absorption lines in the co - added residuals ( any further challenges with this notwithstanding , see above ) , and entirely falsify the luminosity ( and hence , mass ) ratio that was derived from the absorption - line strengths , etc .",
    "in the following section , we will therefore use an independent approach to obtain an estimate on the inclination angle .",
    "as mentioned above , it is well known that in wr+o binaries , where both stars have strong winds , wwcs occur which generate two cone - shaped shocks separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "this contact discontinuity wraps around the star with the weaker wind ( i.e. that with less wind momentum ) , which is usually the o star .",
    "as the shocked matter flows with high velocities downstream along the contact discontinuity , it cools , giving rise to excess emissions which can be seen atop some optical emission lines of the wr star .",
    "the position of the excess bumps atop the emission lines depends on the orientation of the flow .",
    "the shock - cone acts like a beacon of a lighthouse : if it is pointing towards the observer , the excess emission will be blue - shifted , and half an orbit later , the matter will be flowing away from the observer , resulting in a red - shifted excess emission . due to the orbital motion , the coriolis force will slightly distort the cone , tilting its axis and making it curve away at large separations , with respect to the line of sight between the wr and the o star .    to study this behavior in more detail in r145",
    ", all spectra were shifted into the rest frame of the wr star .",
    "then , a minimum spectrum was computed by averaging spectra obtained near apastron , i.e. around @xmath86 , when the wwc excess emissions are weakest .",
    "( while the excess emissions are not zero , as will be shown below , differences remain small and have no influence on the conclusions drawn here . ) due to the eccentricity of the orbit , phases near apastron are well covered , and a good - quality minimum spectrum was obtained .",
    "the minimum was subtracted from all spectra of the time series , the residuals were shifted back into the observer s frame of reference , folded into the corresponding phase of the binary period , and a dynamic spectrum was constructed where the intensities are coded in greyscales , white being the strongest emission .",
    "forty phase - bins were used for good resolution , covering one orbital cycle centered on @xmath87 , at which periastron passage occurs . the result is shown in figure [ mon119 ] .    since the wwc",
    "excess emissions vary in shape and position over the orbital cycle in a defined way , modelling their profile can be used to obtain an independent measure of the system parameters like e.g. the orbital inclination ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of our data is not sufficient to grant such an analysis , but a simplified method was developed by @xcite that still allows one to obtain valuable information from the phase dependency of the excess emission .",
    "following hill et al.s ( 2000 ) approach , we have measured the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and the mean rv of the excess - emission profiles , i.e. of the residuals after having subtracted the minimum spectrum ( see above ) .",
    "these values follow the relation    @xmath88    with @xmath89 and @xmath90 simple constants , @xmath91 the stream velocity along the shock cone , @xmath92 the half opening angle of the cone , @xmath93 the respective orbital phase is for a circular orbit ; for an elliptical orbit , we replace @xmath93 by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the true anomaly .",
    "thus , the wr star passes inferior conjunction when @xmath96 .",
    "] , @xmath97 the tilt angle of the cone axis due to the coriolis force which leads to a phase shift between the orbital and the cone motion , and @xmath0 the orbital inclination angle ( also see fig . 6 of @xcite ) .",
    "a constraint is that the stream velocity in the cone must not exceed the wind terminal velocity ( 1300 kms@xmath17 , see section [ massloss ] )",
    ". a least - square fit to the data is shown in figure [ wwcfit ] .",
    "it is satisfactory for the fwhm , but less so for the mean rv , most likely to insufficient data quality .",
    "we obtain @xmath98 kms@xmath17 , @xmath99 kms@xmath17 , @xmath100 kms@xmath17 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the inclination angle is found to be @xmath103 , in excellent agreement with the result obtained by polarimetry . just as in the case of the polarimetry ( see above ) , a fit with @xmath104 is ruled out by the data ; thus it appears that r145 is indeed seen under such a low inclination , with the consequences discussed above .    as can be seen from figure [ mon119 ] ,",
    "the wwc excess emission is by far strongest at periastron passage , i.e. when the two stars are closest to each other , and quickly drops when the separation between the stars increases .",
    "the dependence of the excess emission on the separation can be studied in more detail , using the recipe by @xcite .",
    "these authors have shown that the wwc zone of relatively wide binaries can be treated as adiabatic , even at periastron ; therefore the amount of x - ray flux generated by wwc is expected to go with the inverse separation between the stars ( also see @xcite ) . since heii @xmath114686 is a recombination line ( i.e. formed through `` collision '' of two particles ) the formalism of @xcite can be applied to the strength of the excess emission , too . assuming the wwc excess emission in heii @xmath114686 to be optically thin",
    ", we can thus expect a rise and fall of the emissitivity which is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the separation between the wr and the o star .",
    "we here use the relative separation @xmath107 as a function of true anomaly @xmath95 , normalized by the minimum separation @xmath108 , i.e.    @xmath109    where @xmath95 is the true anomaly of the orbital ellipse and @xmath110 at periastron ( @xmath111 , phase of the elliptical orbit @xmath87 ) , and consequently @xmath112 at apastron ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) . note",
    "that due to this normalization , the expression is independent of the inclination angle .",
    "however , while the excess emission is minimum at apastron , it is not generally zero . thus , the observed ew of the heii @xmath114686 emission is at any time the sum of the ew of the unperturbed wr emission , @xmath115 , and a separation - dependent excess flux , @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 , with @xmath118 a constant ( the maximum excess ) , and @xmath107 as defined above . for verification , we also fitted a steeper dependency , @xmath119 .    from equal - weight least - square fitting",
    ", we obtained pairs of @xmath120 for the @xmath121 dependency , and @xmath122 for the @xmath123 case ( ews in  ) .",
    "the data are shown in figure [ ew4686 ] , with the two theoretical curves overplotted .",
    "while both curves certainly look equally well - fitting , the @xmath123 curve yields a @xmath23 that is @xmath610% larger than that for the @xmath121 case .",
    "since our data are rather noisy , and show larger scatter around periastron than around apastron , it is difficult to assess the true ( _ a posteriori _ ) measurement error per individual data point . using the scatter of the data around apastron for this , the normalized @xmath124 of the fit is @xmath62 , but larger if the scatter around periastron is adopted .",
    "independent of any issues regarding the orbital inclination angle , we can obtain a rough estimate of the mass - loss rate , @xmath125 , of the wn6h star in r145 , assuming that the companion has a negligible mass loss . following the prescription of moffat et al .",

    ", @xcite found @xmath134 kms@xmath17 .",
    "s08 report that the fwhm of the heii @xmath114686 emission line in r145 is only slightly smaller than in r144 ; assuming that both stars are similar enough that the fwhm of heii @xmath114686 can act as a reasonable proxy of the terminal wind velocity , we adopt for r145 a value of @xmath135 kms@xmath17 . for @xmath0 and @xmath136 , the averaged values from table [ orbitalelements ] are taken .    inserting those values in the equation given above yields a very high mass - loss rate of @xmath137 m@xmath7yr@xmath17 (",
    "remarkably , for inclination angles between @xmath138 and @xmath25 this value changes barely ) . from tailored analysis and using models without iron - line blanketing and wind clumping",
    ", @xcite found @xmath139 m@xmath7yr@xmath17 for r144 . introducing typical clumping factors",
    "@xmath140 usually reduces the mass - loss rates derived from spectroscopic means by a factor of @xmath141 , i.e. to more sensible @xmath142 m@xmath7yr@xmath17 ; since r144 is the more luminous star of the two , one would expect an even lower mass - loss rate for r145 .",
    "however , since polarization depends only on the number of scatterers ( i.e. electrons ) , polarimetric diagnostics are unaffected by wind clumping , and polarization is indeed observed to be that high in r145 .",
    "thus , assuming the models to be correct , such a high , continuous mass - loss rate for r145 would be sensible only if the wind were particularly smooth .",
    "another way to lower the derived mass - loss rate would be to considerably decrease the orbital separation @xmath143 or the terminal wind speed @xmath130 .",
    "the former would require a mass - ratio closer to unity , with the consequences discussed above , while the latter is unlikely , given the close resemblance of r145 to r144 .",
    "we thus conclude that the primary of r145 may in fact have a very high mass - loss rate , subject to further confirmation .",
    "we have combined previously published radial velocity ( rv ) data from @xcite with data obtained by @xcite , along with previously unpublished polarimetric data , for the two wn6h stars r144 and r145 in the lmc .",
    "while the former star was first suspected to be binary by @xcite , the latter had already been identified as a binary by moffat ( 1989 ) .    while our study could not reveal any periodicity in the data of r144",
    ", we have , for the first time , established the full set of orbital parameters for r145 .",
    "the orbital period was found to be @xmath144 days , in contrast to the preliminary estimate of 25.4 days by moffat ( 1989 ) , based on the assumption of a circular orbit . from our analysis of the polarimetric data for r145 ,",
    "the inclination angle of the orbital system was found to be very low , @xmath145 .",
    "this value was confirmed by a simplified study of the phase - dependent excess emission on the heii @xmath114686 line due to wind - wind collision . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", we obtained a consistent value of @xmath103 .    by applying a modified version of the shift - and - add method originally developed by demers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we were able to isolate the spectral signature of the o - star companion .",
    "we found the rv amplitude of the primary ( wn ) star to be @xmath146 kms@xmath17 , while the rv amplitude of the secondary ( o ) star was found to be @xmath147 kms@xmath17 .",
    "we derived the _",
    "minimum _ masses of the wr and the o component to be , respectively , @xmath148 m@xmath7 and @xmath149 m@xmath7 . while the large mass ratio @xmath150 is compatible with the strong dilution of the o - companion s absorption lines , the absolute masses of the two stars are problematic .",
    "if the derived , low inclination angle is correct , one obtains minimum absolute masses of 300 and 125 m@xmath7 for the wn and the o star , respectively , but such high masses are not compatible with the observed luminosity of r145 , which puts the system between ngc3603-a1 ( see @xcite ) and wr20a ( @xcite ) .",
    "given that both ngc3603-a1 and wr20a consist of two @xmath6equally bright stars , while in r145 the wn component dominates the light , masses of 120 and 50 m@xmath7 are more likely , but this would require an inclination angle close to 90@xmath5 , which is not supported by the data .",
    "another possibility , the mass ratio being closer to unity , is not supported by the results of the shift - and - add method . thus , something is clearly odd in r145 , and more and better data are required .    from the polarimetric data for r145 , we also estimated a rather extreme value of the mass - loss rate for the wr component , of @xmath151 m@xmath7yr@xmath17 , which is suspiciously high even for such a massive and hence luminous object . analyzing the heii @xmath114686 excess emission from wind - wind collisions in r145 , we find that its strength depends on the separation @xmath152 of the two stars as @xmath153 , as is expected from theory of adiabatic winds , but that a steeper dependence , @xmath154 , which was reported for wr140 by @xcite , can not unambiguously be ruled out",
    ".    given the very large uncertainties on the values derived from our data , our findings can not be considered other than preliminary . however , given the fact that r145 seems to contain one of the most luminous and thus probably also most massive stars known in the local group , we feel that any additional effort is well deserved to obtain more reliable results .",
    "therefore , we are currently carrying out a long - term monitoring of this system , along with r144 , but we strongly encourage independent studies of these potential cornerstone objects .",
