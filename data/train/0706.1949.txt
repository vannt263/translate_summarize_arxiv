    "in a recent work @xcite , we have shown that , when the dimension of the graph over which an ising spin glass model is defined turns out to be infinite dimensional , the critical surface and the critical behavior of the model between the paramagnetic ( p ) and the disordered ferro / antiferromagnetic ( f / af ) or the spin glass ( sg ) phases in the p regions , for shortness _ the upper critical surface and the corresponding critical behavior _ , can be determined through a simple mapping with a _ related ising model _ ; a non random model .",
    "infinite dimensional here includes two families of graphs : the ones in which the number of first neighbors goes to infinity , as referred to as _ infinite dimensional in the strict sense _ , and the ones characterized by the fact that the probability @xmath0 that two randomly chosen infinitely long paths overlap for @xmath1 bonds , goes to zero sufficiently fast for @xmath1 going to infinity , as referred to as _ infinite dimensional in the broad sense_. as examples , the first class includes the fully connected graph , over which one defines the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , whereas the second class includes models defined over bethe lattices and random graphs .    in the ref .",
    "@xcite we have derived the mapping for the models infinite dimensional in the strict sense , whereas , except for the bethe lattice case , we have only provided plausible arguments for the other class of models to which we have already applied the mapping in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a complete proof of the mapping for the models infinite dimensional in the broad sense providing a sufficient condition on @xmath0 for the mapping to become exact .",
    "we shall show that this condition requires that @xmath0 decays exponentially fast for @xmath1 going to infinity , eq .",

    "we will see in fact that many graphs of interest , including all the ones considered in the ref .",
    "@xcite , satisfy this condition . in spite of the great simplicity of the equations of the mapping ( [ gi]-[mapp01 g ] ) ,",
    "their rigorous proof is quite far from being simple .",
    "in fact , even within the context of the replica trick , remarkable efforts , involving the use of probability theory and functional analysis , have been required in deriving the proof .",
    "we stress however that our necessity for having a complete proof of the mapping is not due only to a mathematical exigence , but to an urgent and practical motivation .",
    "in fact , although in the previous papers @xcite and @xcite we have checked the mapping on a number of different cases , all those cases ( except the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , which is infinite dimensional in the strict sense ) belong to a class of models whose graphs , roughly speaking , are characterized for having a finite number of closed paths per vertex . for this class of models",
    ", one might suspect that the mapping works because of the tree - like approximation , the loops here being in a sense negligible .",
    "however , there exists another class of models whose graphs have instead an infinite number of closed paths per vertex but the overlap between two arbitrarily chosen paths remains sufficiently small so that @xmath0 decays exponentially in @xmath1 and the mapping remains exact .",
    "we point out that in this latter class of models , applying the tree - like approximation and neglecting correlations due to loops ( in other words using the bethe - peierls approximation @xcite ) , in general , may lead to wrong results .    after introducing the models in sec .",

    "( we are considering a general measure @xmath26 allowing also for a possible dependence on the bonds ) @xmath27    we will take the boltzmann constant @xmath28 .",
    "a generic inverse critical temperature of the spin glass model , if any , will be indicated with @xmath29 ; finally the density free energy in the thermodynamic limit will be indicated with @xmath30 @xmath31",
    "we recall that a path , finite or infinite , is defined as a sequence , finite or infinite , of connected bonds @xmath32 with no vertex repetition . given a set of links @xmath4 ,",

    "from now on we will assume that the following limit exists @xmath41 the existence of this limit is a natural requirement which has to be satisfied in order to have a thermodynamic limit and it is in fact satisfied as soon as the vertices of the graph @xmath4 become statistically equivalent for @xmath42 .",
    "a quite different question concerns instead the existence of the limits of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , as we shall show later , at least in finite @xmath43-dimensional hypercube lattice , such limits do not exist .",

    "then , by looking at the hypercube @xmath43-dimensional lattice of size @xmath1 whose dimension satisfies the rule @xmath58 , by analogy , the natural dimension of the graph @xmath59 can be defined as @xmath60 it is easy to see for example @xcite that in a bethe lattice of degree @xmath61 one has @xmath62 , so that in particular @xmath63 for @xmath64 . despite this definition of dimensionality",

    "in fact , its use , to the best of our knowledge , has remained only at an heuristic level , whereas , as we shall show , the definition of infinite dimensionality in the broad sense we have above introduced turns out to be the sufficient condition for the mapping to become exact which , in particular , allows to establish rigorously that almost all models built up over random graphs satisfying this condition have in fact , as expected , a mean - field - like critical behavior @xcite .    the definition of infinite dimensionality in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ prob4 ] ) can be read as a definition of infinite dimensionality concerning vertices .",
    "it is easy to check that our definition of infinite dimensionality implies a corresponding infinite dimensionality in the sense of paths as in eq .",

    "however , we stress that even if eq . ( [ prob5 ] ) is satisfied , the condition of infinite dimensionality in the broad sense as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ prob2 ] ) , represents a more restrictive condition than eq .",
    "( [ prob5 ] ) , giving a key information about the probability @xmath34 ; in fact eq .",
    "( [ prob5 ] ) in general does not imply eq .",

    "here we give a short list of examples of graphs satisfying the condition ( [ prob2 ] ) . for these cases there exists even the limit distribution @xmath0 of eq .",
    "( [ prob2l ] ) whose behavior can be easily estimated for large @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) lends itself to be interpreted also as the ratio between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , _ i.e. _ , the ratio involving the cardinalities per vertex rather than the total cardinalities .      for a bethe lattice of degree",
    "@xmath75 we can estimate @xmath0 as follows . let us fix a root vertex and an arbitrary infinitely long path ( the path 1 ) starting from this root vertex .",
    "now , let us draw out an arbitrary infinitely long path ( the path 2 ) starting from the root vertex .",
    "the path 2 can overlap the first bond of the path 1 with a probability @xmath76 . if this happens , the path 2 can overlap the path 1 over the second bond with a probability @xmath77 and so on .",
    "therefore we have that the two paths overlap for at least l bonds with a probability given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the normalization constant . since @xmath80 and @xmath75 we have eq . ( [ prob2 ] ) .",
    "we can immediately generalize the above result to the case of an arbitrary infinite tree , that is a general bethe lattice . in this case , if the minimum statistically relevant ( that is with non zero weight ) degree of the tree is @xmath81 , for large @xmath1 we have again @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to see that even if we add a finite number of closed paths per vertex to the previous tree ( our definition of generalized tree - like structure ) for large @xmath1 we are again left with @xmath82 .      here",
    "we note only that essentially for large @xmath1 we have again @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "however , we advise the reader that for such graphs the density free energy @xmath85 does not exist whereas the existence of @xmath85 ( _ i.e. _ , the existence of a well defined thermodynamic ) is a necessary condition for the mapping .",
    "therefore , in general the application of the mapping on husimi trees may lead to wrong results .",
    "we will come back on this question in sec .",
    "[ nishi ] .",
    "nevertheless the husimi trees provide an interesting example belonging to the class of non tree - like graphs mentioned in the introduction : these graphs are infinite dimensional in the broad sense but have a number of closed paths per vertex infinite .",
    "it would be of great interest to study a some random version of these graphs defined in such a way that the density free energy @xmath85 turns out to be well defined , like happens for the random versions of the bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "we point out also that , unlike the non existence of @xmath85 as a proper thermodynamic limit of a succession @xmath86 of density free energies for finite husimi trees of size @xmath3 , the thermodynamic limit ( [ prob1 ] ) does exist .",
    "the previous cases can be read as examples of quenched graphs .",
    "many interesting models are instead built over an ensemble of random graphs @xmath87 equipped with some probability @xmath88 for extracting a given graph @xmath89 ( see for example @xcite ) . in this case the free energy of the model is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the partition function of the quenched system in the graph @xmath2 with couplings @xmath92 .",

    "<S> recently , it has been shown that , when the dimension of a graph turns out to be infinite dimensional in a broad sense , the upper critical surface and the corresponding critical behavior of an arbitrary ising spin glass model defined over such a graph , can be exactly mapped on the critical surface and behavior of a non random ising model . a graph can be infinite dimensional in a strict sense , like the fully connected graph , or in a broad sense , as happens on a bethe lattice and in many random graphs . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we firstly introduce our definition of dimensionality which is compared to the standard definition and readily applied to test the infinite dimensionality of a large class of graphs which , remarkably enough , includes even graphs where the tree - like approximation ( or , in other words , the bethe - peierls approach ) , in general , may be wrong . </S>",
    "<S> then , we derive a detailed proof of the mapping for all the graphs satisfying this condition . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> , the mapping provides immediately a very general nishimori law . </S>"
