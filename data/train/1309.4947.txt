    "dynamic self - organization of motile components can be observed in a wide range of length scales , from bird flocks @xcite to bacterial colonies @xcite and assemblies of motor and structural proteins @xcite .",
    "the fascination with these phenomena has naturally inspired researchers to use a physical understanding of motility to engineer complex emergent behaviors in model systems that promise revolutionary advance in technological applications if combined with other novel biomimetic functions , such as signal processing and decision making @xcite , or replication @xcite .",
    "symmetry - based phenomenological theories , coarse - grained or particle - based @xcite offer a guide to the rich possibilities immanent in self - driven systems , but designing a system requires a bottom - up approach .",
    "biological components pose inevitable limitations on this task , while chemical @xcite , mechanical @xcite or externally actuated @xcite imitations appear more promising .",
    "in addition to motility , living organisms have developed mechanisms that allow them to orient their motion in response to chemical gradients , and send signals to recruit or repel others @xcite .",
    "can inanimate matter imitate these more complex functions ? we show that it can , and present the necessary design principles .",
    "we consider the case of catalytic active colloids @xcite , which we now describe in brief .",
    "recall that a colloidal particle can be driven `` phoretically '' into motion by _ externally imposed _ chemical , electrostatic or thermal gradients @xcite .",
    "an _ active _ colloid  a particle coated asymmetrically with catalyst and immersed in a _ uniform _ background of substrate  generates its own chemical gradient @xcite , and thus moves autonomously in a direction determined by the polarity of the coat .",
    "such self - phoretic particles , whose individual activity and interactions one can design , offer the opportunity to create systems with controllable , emergent collective behavior @xcite . to this end",
    "it is essential to construct a description at a coarse - grained level , with coefficients expressed in terms of single - particle parameters .",
    "our focus is on how the center of mass and orientation vector of an active colloid are affected by an externally imposed gradient of substrate molecules .",
    "depending on details of geometry , activity , and mobility @xcite , an active colloid will respond to the local gradient of the substrate concentration through four distinct mechanisms .",
    "( i ) _ chemotaxis : _ the fluid flows set up around the particle can turn its axis of orientation to align parallel or antiparallel to the local gradient ; this process has active contributions arising from the chemical reaction as well as passive ones ( ii ) _ polar run - and - tumble motion : _ the enzymatic rate depends nonlinearly on the local concentration of the substrate with a characteristic michaelis - menten form inherited from the underlying catalytic kinetics of the reactions @xcite . the combination of enhanced activity at high concentrations and randomized orientation acts to effectively populate the colloids in `` slow '' regions @xcite .",
    "( iii ) _ apolar run - and - tumble motion : _ an active colloid can also chemotax by a net motion of its center along a gradient in a noise - averaged sense .",
    "( iv ) _ phoretic response : _ the colloid moves along an external chemical gradient by diffusiophoresis .",
    "a summary of the different modes is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "catalytic colloids consume a substrate and generate product molecules , and hence act as mobile sources and sinks of these chemicals in the solution making their concentration profile nonuniform . in a suspension of such active colloids , each individual responds  via the above four mechanisms  to the gradients produced by other colloids due to their activities .",
    "the various contributions are independent of each other and their balance will be modified as we move in the space of control parameters , leading to a variety of collective behaviors . in particular , we highlight the intriguing possibility that the positional and orientational degrees of freedom could exhibit different and independent types of order depending on the parameters , as shown in figs . 2 and 3 .    [",
    "fig : scheme ]    we consider a fluid medium containing a concentration @xmath0 of substrate ( s ) molecules , which upon contact with a catalyst are converted to a product p with concentration @xmath1 .",
    "the rate of conversion @xmath2 obeys michaelis - menten kinetics @xcite , growing linearly at small @xmath3 and crossing over to saturation for sufficiently large values of @xmath3 .",
    "our main results are as follows : * ( 1 ) * for the case of a uniform gradient of substrate , we establish the form of the angular velocity @xmath4 induced on a single catalytic colloid as a function of the spherical harmonic components of the activity @xmath5 and the mobilities @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to s and p. we can therefore propose criteria for the surface patterning required to produce chemotactic and anti - chemotactic motion .",
    "we also find the various contributions to the translational velocity @xmath8 of the colloid , arising from self - propulsion and drift due to the external gradient .",
    "explicitly , we find @xmath9 where the definitions of the coefficients in terms of the surface properties of the colloids are given below . * ( 2 ) * we use our results for a single particle in an external gradient to construct the collective equations of motion for the number density and orientation of the colloids in a uniform medium , interacting via their effect on the substrate and product concentration fields .",
    "the interplay between self - propulsion , phoretic drift , and alignment , driven by and mediated via chemicals , falls into two distinct regimes .",
    "( a ) when the fuel concentration is small enough such that the catalytic activity is _ diffusion - limited _ , the chemical concentrations will be effectively screened , and the system could develop enhanced number fluctuations and clumping instabilities ( where all wavelengths above a threshold are unstable ) and patterns with a given length scale ( where the fastest - growing mode has finite wavelength ) .",
    "( b ) at sufficiently high fuel concentrations where the catalytic activity becomes _ reaction - limited _ , the chemical fields are not screened and can mediate long - ranged interactions that could lead to a wider variety of instabilities . in particular , for the case of effectively attractive phoretic interaction we observe collapse transitions that are dissipative analogs of a jeans instability @xcite , with or without simultaneous condensation of asters . for effectively repulsive phoretic interactions",
    ", we observe counter - intuitively that a collapsed phase with aster condensation is still possible , as are stable phases exhibiting debye - like screening , similar to electrolytes .",
    "moreover , we find that in this regime the system could exhibit plasma - like oscillations in response to perturbations , or spontaneous , self - sustained ringing .",
    "detailed phase diagrams inferred from our stability analysis and structure factor calculations are found in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "these are parameterized , via definitions in eq .",
    "[ ab ] below , by coefficients @xmath10 describing the chemotactic response from panels ( i ) and ( ii ) of fig . 1 , and @xmath11 the phoretic response from panels ( iii ) and ( iv ) of that figure .",
    "we now show how we obtained these results .",
    "diffusiophoresis is the force - free , torque - free propulsion of a colloid by a solute concentration gradient @xcite . in a fluid of viscosity @xmath12 at temperature @xmath13 a species with concentration @xmath14 interacting through an effective potential @xmath15 with a particle surface with normal along the local @xmath16 axis gives rise , via the stokes equation , to a surface `` slip velocity '' @xmath17 , with the phoretic mobility @xmath18 that can have either _ sign _ depending on @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "what happens in an inhomogeneous background ?",
    "can the flows set up by the interaction of s and p with the swimmer surface reorient its axis @xmath20 with respect to the local concentration gradient , thus imitating chemotaxis ? to answer this question ,",
    "we solve for the concentrations @xmath3 and @xmath21 , with diffusivities @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we incorporate the catalytic chemical reaction s @xmath24 p through source and sink boundary conditions on particle fluxes normal ( @xmath25 ) to the swimmer surface : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability that the enzyme at @xmath28 is bound to the substrate .",
    "stationarity implies @xmath29 leading to the michaelis - menten @xcite expression @xmath30 for the reaction velocity per molecule .",
    "number conservation for the products and substrates , and the assumption that @xmath3 and @xmath21 diffuse rapidly compared to the colloid so that time dependencies and advection by flow @xcite can be ignored give @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the background substrate profile .",
    "we thus need to solve for just one of the two concentration fields .",
    "we work in the linear regime and @xmath33 , in which the chemical reaction influences significantly the local value of @xmath3 so that the coupled dynamics of orientation and translation can lead to oscillations , will be discussed elsewhere . ]",
    "@xmath34 , where the profile of product @xmath21 resulting from this process is sensitive to the imposed gradient of @xmath3 , and in the limit where s diffuses rapidly so that its profile is maintained .",
    "the resulting slip velocity , which has contributions from both the substrate and the product , leads to the linear and angular velocities @xmath35 and @xmath36 for spherical colloids .    to understand the general trends in chemotactic behavior arising from simple catalytic patterns , we work with a limited number of non - zero spherical harmonic components of @xmath5 and @xmath37 . for example , taking @xmath38 for @xmath39 we find the expression for the angular velocity given in eq .",

    "the form of eq .",
    "[ spfom ] serves to illustrate some features that hold even without the truncated expansion in @xmath42 : if either @xmath5 or @xmath37 contain all odd or all even harmonics there is no reorientation in response to the gradient , a result which holds for spheroidal swimmers as well .",

    "[ res_sp ] where @xmath47 the three contributions to the translational velocity correspond to self - propulsion ( along @xmath48 ) , phoretic drift ( along @xmath49 ) , and an anisotropic drift that is instantaneously along @xmath48 , but leads to net motion along @xmath49 as rotational noise de - correlates @xmath48 .",
    "the latter amounts to a contribution to run - and - tumble gradient - seeking motion , which we name apolar run - and - tumble ; see fig . 1 .    to demonstrate how the chemotactic response of catalytic colloids can be designed , we have calculated @xmath50 for an example of swimmers with uniform spheroidal caps of catalytic and mobility patterns as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
