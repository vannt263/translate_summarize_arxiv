    "the irregularities in the cosmic ray ( cr ) energy spectrum of `` knee '' type at @xmath2  ev and `` ankle '' type at @xmath3  ev found in  @xcite are yet of special interest from the point of view of interpretation of these phenomena from the position of astrophysics . in recent years",
    "a few papers  @xcite have been published which try to explain such a behavior of cr spectrum with the help of new models of generation and propagation of crs .",
    "there exists also another namely a nuclear - physical point of view for the formation of irregularity at @xmath4  ev  @xcite . in some sense , the answer to the problem on reasons of the formation of breaks is in the detailed study of different eas characteristics in the region of the first and second irregularities in the spectrum .",
    "we have made such a work in  @xcite .",
    "the cascade curves of eas development in fig.[fig2 ] were reconstructed according to the method suggested in  @xcite .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig2 ] that the maximum depth of cascade curves depends on the primary particle mass composition as well as the hadron interaction model .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig2 ] that to describe the experimental cascade curve ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) the qgsjet model is better - suited  @xcite .",

    "it is seen from calculations that the ratio strongly depends on a mass composition . from comparison of the calculations by the qgsjet model for the proton , iron nucleus and experimental data",

    "results on longitudinal and radial development of eas are presented in figures . from the total combination of data",
    "one can select two energy regions where , as is seen from figures , the characteristics of eas have the complex dependence on the energy .",

    "the results of the cosmic ray mass composition in the energy range @xmath36  ev have been obtained .",
    "it follows from the analysis that after the `` knee '' the mass composition becomes heavier and in the region of `` ankle '' , on the contrary , becomes lighter .",
