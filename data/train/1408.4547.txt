    "the spin decay length @xmath146 , in contrast , depends on transport time . for purely diffusive motion in the dyakonov - perel regime , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the carrier scattering time and @xmath106 the diffusion coefficient , reduces with transport distance @xmath26 .",
    "as a result , the requirement @xmath149 becomes increasingly difficult to be satisfied for long transport distances @xmath26 ( as well as for strong so fields ) . in the present experiments , the expansion forces due to _ ix_-_ix _ repulsive interactions appear to have a fundamental role , since they considerably reduce the transport time , thus increasing @xmath45 and enabling the observation of precession oscillations .",
    "coherent spin patterns resulting from precession in the so field have been reported for macroscopically ordered _ ix _ phases.@xcite the long spin coherence lengths required for their formation have been attributed to the reduced scattering in the ordered state , which enables the exciton transport in the ballistic regime .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show that long spin lifetimes and transport lengths , as well as coherent precession in the so field can also be achieved in the drift - diffusive regime . this behavior is followed occurs over a wide range of exciton densities , thus indicating that it is not associated with collective effects .",

    "@xcite has invoked the simultaneous evolution of hole and electron spins .    finally , as in most of the reports of coherent precession of optically injected spins in the so field , the absence of hole spin contributions to the spin dynamics",
    "is attributed to the short hole spin coherence times as well as the spatial separation of the electron and hole wave function in the dqw structure .",
    "since we have excited and probed _ ix _ spins , an interesting question is whether the electrons and hole remain bound during transport .",
    "although we can not present a conclusive evidence for this behavior , we mention that the _ ix _ spins have been excited with small excess energy ( approx .",
    "10  mev ) , thus reducing the probability of exciton dissociation followed by the spatial separation of electrons and holes .",
    "in addition , the _ ix _ spatial profiles ( cf . , e.g. ,   fig .  [ figixsetup](c ) ) do not show the characteristic rings observed when electrons and holes diffuse independently .",
    "we have presented experimental evidence for the coherent precession of exciton spins during transport in the effective magnetic field induced by the so interaction .",
    "the precession dynamics is essentially independent of the ix density , but can be controlled by an external bias ( via changes in the so field ) or magnetic field .",
    "the spin dynamics are well explained by taking into account electron spin precession , with no noticeable hole spin contribution .",
    "the technique used by us allows for the control and discrimination of precession effects arising from the rashba and dresselhaus so contributions , as well as those induced by an external magnetic field . in this way",
    ", we were able to directly determine the absolute value and sign of the spin splitting parameters for the rashba and dresselhaus so mechanisms .",
    "in addition , the spin dynamics in the presence of an external magnetic field yield information about the precession dynamics during transport .",
