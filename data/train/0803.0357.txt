    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) represents a large fraction of the energy generated during the history of the universe .",
    "the two main contributers to the cib are fusion processes within stars and accretion processes on to black holes ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the contribution to the cib from accretion is less well constrained than that from stars because agn surveys have always suffered from systematics and incompleteness .",
    "optical and soft x - ray surveys tend to miss dust- or gas - obscured agn , while surveys at wavelengths insensitive to absorption either include only small sub - populations of agn ( radio ) or are very limited by flux or survey area limitations ( hard x - ray , infrared ) . with the advent of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite and the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite the tools became available to do the wide - field imaging surveys needed to determine the relative contribution of stars and agn to the cib throughout the history of the universe .    in this paper",
    "we examine the mid - ir colors of a large sample of x - ray sources in the @xmath6  square degree botes field of the noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a ground based survey from the optical to the near - ir ( b@xmath7rijk@xmath8 ) .",
    "the x - ray sources were detected in the _ chandra _ xbotes survey of the field @xcite , and then matched to the mid - ir sources found in the _ spitzer _ irac shallow survey of the field @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that in a [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] vs [ 5.8 ] - [ 8.0 ] color - color diagram there was a distinct branch of point - like 3.6  sources that were probably agn .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite using spectroscopy of nearly 10,000 of the shallow survey sources including 681 agn from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , kochanek et al . in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite found a similar color grouping in the _ spitzer _ first look survey based on 54 optically identified quasars . in this paper",
    "we characterize the mid - ir properties of the full _ chandra _ xbotes sample .",
    "there have been several previous surveys comparing x - ray and mid - ir sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but our present survey is significantly larger .",
    "our objectives are to characterize the mid - ir color distributions of x - ray sources and the efficiency with which we can detect x - ray sources in the mid - ir . in ",
    "2 we describe the x - ray and mid - ir observations and our method for matching the two catalogs . in ",
    "3 we compare the two samples , and we summarize the results in  4 .",
    "the xbotes survey @xcite imaged roughly 8.5 square degrees of the botes ndwfs using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument on _ chandra _ in a series of 126 short ( 5 ks ) observations .",
    "the resulting limiting flux was @xmath910@xmath10 cts s@xmath4 corresponding to @xmath98@xmath110@xmath2 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 in the 0.5 - 7.0 kev range .",
    "we use a catalog of 3442 sources with 4 or more counts that has a spurious detection rate of approximately 1% @xcite . matching the x - ray sources to their irac counterparts",
    "is complicated by the fact that the positions of the x - ray sources have significant uncertainties that depend on the fluxes of the sources and their locations relative to the _ chandra _ optical axis .",
    "psf is only 06 fwhm on axis , but degrades quadratically with off - axis distance , reaching 60 when 10  arcmin off - axis .",
    "we adopt an astrometric uncertainty appropriate to each source based on its off axis position , divided by the square root of the source counts , with a fixed minimum uncertainty of 15 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the irac shallow survey @xcite covers 8.5 square degrees of the ndwfs field with 3 or more 30 sec exposures per position resulting in 17,076 separate 5@xmath15  images in the four irac bands .",
    "sources were identified and characterized using sextractor v2.3.2 @xcite , resulting in detections ( within 6  diameter apertures ) of @xmath9 270,000 , 200,000 , 27,000 , and 26,000 sources brighter than the 5@xmath11 detection limits of 18.4 , 17.7 , 15.5 , and 14.5 vega magnitudes ( 12.3 , 14.9 , 72.3 , 102 @xmath5jy ) in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  bands , respectively .",
    "the irac zeropoints are accurate at the 5% level @xcite and the positions are accurate to 03 .",
    "since the x - ray survey covered a slightly larger area than the ir survey , we trimmed the x - ray survey by requiring that all the x - ray sources , including their error radii , were completely within the ir survey region .",
    "this resulted in a final x - ray catalog of 3086 sources .",
    "matching one catalog with @xmath9 3100 sources , many of which have significant positional uncertainties , to a second catalog with @xmath9 270,000 sources presents some challenges .",
    "if our matching criteria are too strict , then we have many false negatives , while if they are too liberal , we have many false positives .    to best address",
    "this matching challenge we use the bayesian source identification method used by @xcite for identifying the optical counterparts to the xbotes sources .",
    "the method optimizes the parameters of the matching criterion and supplies probabilities for both identifying the x - ray source with each nearby irac source and for the x - ray source having no identification in the irac catalog . as a check on the bayesian identification",
    ", we also used a simpler proximity match for the subset of 1658 x - ray sources with positional uncertainties @xmath1220 .",
    "this simple proximity match serves as a check for anomolies in the results from the bayesian method .",
    "the results for both techniques and all four irac wavebands are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fraction of identified sources depends on the ir band because the sensitivity of the observations is greatest at 3.6 and 4.5  but significantly worse at 5.8 and 8.0 .",
    "figure  1 shows a comparison between the bayesian and proximity match techniques based on the @xmath13-[8.0]$ ] and @xmath14 - [ 8.0]$ ] colors and it is clear that the bayesian matches are not introducing new populations , but the bayesian technique is significantly increasing the number of matched sources in the bands where an increase is most useful .",
    "since no problems were identified with the bayesian method , we adopt the bayesian results for the remainder of our discussion .    in terms of numbers of x - ray sources identified in the ir",
    ", we focus on the 3.6  identifications as this is the most sensitive irac band . in the bayesian method , each possible identification has a probability of being the correct identification .",
    "figure  2 summarizes the distribution of the match probabilities for the most likely 3.6  counterpart for each x - ray source . most sources ( 79% )",
    "are matched at a confidence level above 95% ; 85% are matched at a confidence level above 80% .",
    "in general , the sources with low match probabilities are relatively faint x - ray sources that are observed far off axis and have faint irac counterparts .",
    "there are 349 objects ( 11% )",
    "for which the highest likelihood is that the x - ray source has no counterpart in the irac catalogs .",
    "we extracted 3.6  images of the regions near each of these objects for inspection . in most cases ( 244 objects )",
    "there is an irac source on or near the x - ray position that is fainter than the @xmath15 limit of the catalogs used for the matching procedure limit for the 6  diameter aperture used for the irac catalog is a factor of 2 higher than the 5@xmath11 limit for a 3  aperture which more nearly corresponds to the _ detection _ limit of the survey @xcite .",
    "we use the 6  apertures here to obtain more reliable colors . ] . for another 27 sources",
    "the x - ray source is in a region with either multiple , blended sources or very close to a bright star .",
    "only 79 sources , 2.5% of the total sample , show no obvious irac source near the position of the x - ray source . since the x - ray catalogs are expected to have a roughly 1% false detection rate , this means that only @xmath16 of the true xbotes sources have no counterpart in the irac shallow survey .",
    "of these 79 sources , 70 have probable optical counterparts .",
    "however @xcite estimated from monte carlo simulations that roughly 50% of sources genuinely lacking an optical counterpart would have a spurious counterpart due to the very high optical source density .",
    "irac is considerably less sensitive at 5.8 and 8.0  than at 3.6 and 4.5 , which could lead to biases in the irac color - color distributions we will discuss shortly .",
    "we consider such biases by exploring how @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] colors depend on the presence of 5.8 and 8.0  detections .",
    "figure  3 shows histograms of the @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] color for ( 1 ) all matched objects with @xmath17 detections in the blue channels ( 3.6 and 4.5 ) ( 2 ) @xmath17 detections in all four channels , and ( 3 ) lacking @xmath17 detections in the two red channels ( 5.8 & 8.0 ) .",
    "the median @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] color of the distributions are mutually consistent for all three cases , with median @xmath13-[4.5]=0.49 $ ] , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for cases ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) respectively .",
    "objects with detections in all four bands are marginally redder than the other cases , but the differences are small enough to rule out a significant population of x - ray sources with very blue @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] colors which might be systematically missed at 5.8 and 8.0  .",
    "figure  4 shows the @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] versus @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] color - color distribution of the x - ray sources .",
    "the largest grouping of points running towards red @xmath13- [ 4.5]$ ] colors is the population of agn identified by @xcite and also discussed in @xcite .",
    "superposed on fig .",
    "4 is the color selection criterion developed by @xcite to identify agn based on optical spectroscopy of 681 @xmath2021.5  mag agn found in the survey region by ages . in the @xcite spectroscopic sample ,",
    "77% of the objects meeting the selection criterion were broad line ( _ type i _ ) agn , 6% were narrow line agn ( _ type ii _ ) and 17% were galaxies with no obvious signs of agn activity in their spectra .",
    "these objects may also be agn with optical emission lines that are overwhelmed by the light of the host galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or absorbed by dust and gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as shown in fig .  4 , of the 1325 x - ray sources with detections in all four irac bands , 65% meet the @xcite selection criterion",
    "the problem is categorizing the remaining sources . in fig .",
    "4 we have divided the @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] versus @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] color space into five regions , where region a is the @xcite agn selection region where power law emission of agn from the near to the mid - ir dominates the flux of the host galaxy . for each region",
    "we have also calculated the average x - ray hardness ratios @xmath21 of the sources , where @xmath22 is the number of hard ( 2.0 - 7.0  kev ) counts and s is the number of soft ( 0.5 - 2.0  kev ) counts . in region",
    "a the median ( average ) source has @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and",
    "@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for a hardness ratio of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) ( figure  5 ) .",
    "this value is typical of _ type i _ agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implying the x - ray objects in this the region are dominated by _ type i _ sources as also evidenced by the optical spectroscopy .",
    "a significant number of _ spitzer _ selected sources also have well determined irac colors placing them in this agn wedge but are not detected by xbotes and are optically fainter than the ages spectroscopic limit .",
    "such sources are likely a mixture of fainter _",
    "type i _ agn and obscured , _ type ii _",
    "additionally there are x - ray sources which were detected off axis which are difficult to match to faint irac sources leading to the possibility that faint , obscured agn which are more likely to be _ type ii _ at all wavelengths @xcite may be missed , but this is not the case .",
    "for region a , if we take the subsample of sources with @xmath02   error radii which comprise 30% of the sources in region a , the hardness ratio changes only a small amount from -0.4 to -0.33 .",
    "so a large number of faint irac _ type ii _ sources are not being missed because they were preferentially selected against in off axis matching .",
    "region b , with 3% of the sources , has a median ( average ) hardness ratio of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) which is harder than that of region a. figure 5 illustrates that the hr distribution extends towards harder values than for region a. _ type ii _",
    "agn have harder ratios than _ type i _ agn since in obscured sources soft x - rays tend to be absorbed while hard x - rays are able to escape . so a mixture with relatively more _ type ii _ agn in region b than a would explain the difference in the shapes of the @xmath31 distributions . in terms of the ir colors",
    "@xcite placed the blue limit on region a in @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] color to avoid the inclusion of @xmath32 normal and starburst galaxies , but low luminosity agn will have the same colors as normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so , in addition to a larger percentage of _ type ii_s , region b is likely a combination of low ir luminosity agn at @xmath32 , as well the extension of agn from region a.    region c has a median ( average ) hardness ratio of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) containing 21% of the sources .",
    "most of these sources are relatively blue in @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] either because they are lower luminosity agn with significant contamination of the mid - ir fluxes by their host galaxies or because of strong emission lines in the 3.6  band with paschen @xmath35 at @xmath36 being the most important numerically , but also with contributions from h@xmath35 at @xmath37 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shape and value of the @xmath31 distribution is similar to region a indicating a similar mix of _ type i _ and _ ii _ agn .",
    "region d contains objects with red @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] colors indicative of low redshift pah emission associated with star formation and blue @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] colors indicative of the rayleigh - jeans fall - off of low - redshift stellar emission .",
    "this region contains 6% of the sources and has a median ( average ) hardness ratio of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the difficulty lies in distinguishing emission due to star formation from that due to obscured agn , which can be difficult even with spectroscopy .",
    "the xbotes survey is deep enough to detect starbursts at modest redshifts ( @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) so it is not unreasonable to expect a population of starbursts in the survey .",
    "yr@xmath4 , a salpeter initial mass function with a slope of 2.35 , an upper mass cutoff of 100 @xmath42 , and solar metallicity , produces 2.5@xmath110@xmath43 o stars over a period of 10@xmath44 yr . since the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity from each o star",
    "is estimated to be between 2 and 20@xmath110@xmath45 erg s@xmath4 @xcite , a starburst forming @xmath46  year@xmath4 stars has a hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath95 - 50@xmath110@xmath47 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "that is detectable to @xmath40 to @xmath41 given the hard x - ray sensitivity of the xbotes survey ( 1.5@xmath110@xmath48 erg @xmath3s@xmath4 @xcite ) . ]",
    "starbursts , like _ type ii _",
    "agn , tend to have hard x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "since the median hardness ratio in region d is harder than that of the median source in region a , we expect that region d contains a greater mix of _ type ii _",
    "agn and starbursts , but with a significant fraction of _ type i _ agns as evidenced by the presence of sources with soft x - ray hardness ratios .",
    "these are presumably lower luminosity _ type i _ agn with weak nuclear ir emission that is not dominating the mid - ir colors and pushing them towards region a.    finally , region e , the clump containing 4% of the sources near vega colors of zero , is dominated by x - ray emitting galactic stars and @xmath49 galaxies .",
    "visual inspection of the ndwfs optical data shows that @xmath50 are large , extended , early type galaxies whose x - ray emission is likely from hot x - ray emitting gas rather than an agn .",
    "these sources have softer spectra as compared to all the other regions with a median ( average ) @xmath51 ( @xmath52 )",
    ".      a further check of these results comes from the single @xmath53 _",
    "chandra_/acis field obtained by the large area lyman alpha survey ( lala , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an exposure time of 172  ksec @xcite .",
    "these data reach a hard x - ray ( 210  kev ) detection limit of @xmath54  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , far deeper than the xbotes survey limit of 1.5@xmath1@xmath55  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "we used a simple proximity match with a 20 matching radius for the 168 cataloged sources since the median x - ray positional uncertainty is only @xmath56 .",
    "of the 168 sources in the catalog , 130 ( 77% ) have ( @xmath15 ) @xmath57 m counterparts within a @xmath58 radius .",
    "if we allow for visual matches to @xmath57 m sources fainter than the @xmath15 catalog limit , then we find 145 ( 86% ) counterparts .",
    "this is a similar statistic to that found by @xcite from deep irac and _ chandra _ imaging of a @xmath59 region of the extended groth strip which found irac counterparts for 91% of _ chandra _ sources .",
    "the high rate of recovery of the 172 ksec x - ray sources in the 90 sec irac shallow survey shows that the @xmath91% of the 5ksec sources that lack irac counterparts are not due simply to the fact that the ir survey is too shallow , but that the missing sources have some unusual x - ray / ir characteristics .    in the lala region ,",
    "the xbotes catalog has only 22 sources , of which 21 ( 95% ) have 3.6  counterparts .",
    "the xbotes sources in the lala region are typical of the field as a whole , with 64% ( 9 of 14 ) of the",
    "4-band detected sources satisfying the @xcite agn selection criterion ( region a ) .",
    "of the 35 sources in the deeper lala image that are detected in all four channels , 17 ( 49% ) satisfy the @xcite agn selection criterion and lie in region a. the majority of the rest , 13 ( 37% ) , lie in region c.    with such small numbers it is difficult to make a comparison between the deep and shallow xbotes source fractions , but the greater percentage of sources in region c in the deeper survey may indicate a trend towards a larger fraction of obscured agn at fainter x - ray fluxes .",
    "in this paper we examine the mid - infrared properties of 3086 x - ray sources in the _ chandra _ xbotes survey @xcite that were detected by the irac shallow survey @xcite  the largest comparison of x - ray and mid- infrared sources yet undertaken . despite an integration time of only 90  sec , the irac shallow survey detects 85% of the x - ray sources , with another 13% being detectable at lower confidence levels than the @xmath60 detection limit of the primary shallow survey catalogs .",
    "only 2.5% of the x - ray sources , up to 40% of which may represent false - positives in the x - ray catalogs , lack a counterpart . even in the small area but deeper lala x - ray survey , based on an x - ray exposure time of 172  ksec rather than 5  ksec , most of the x - ray sources",
    "are easily detected ( 77% are in the @xmath15 catalogs and 86% are detected at deeper thresholds ) .",
    "the mid - infrared colors of the x - ray sources show five relatively distinct classes . by far the largest class of sources ( 65% ) satisfy the simple color - selection criteria developed by @xcite to select agn in the mid - infrared ( region a ) .",
    "most of the remaining sources lie in an extension of this region where redshifted emission lines and/or host galaxy contributions to the sed provide for bluer @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] colors ( regions b and c ) .",
    "sources with red @xmath14-[8.0]$ ] colors and blue @xmath13-[4.5]$ ] colors are likely dominated by obscured agn , lower luminosity unobscured agn , and starburst galaxies ( region d ) . finally , small fractions of the sources are clustered near mid - ir colors of zero magnitude ( region e ) .",
    "these sources are a combination of x - ray emitting stars and low redshift galaxies whose x - ray flux comes from x - ray emitting hot gas .",
    "this segregation in color space makes the mid - ir a very efficient wavelength range to do large area surveys for luminous ir agn . in comparison to the xbotes survey which detected @xmath93000 sources in 630 ks ,",
    "the irac shallow survey detected @xmath92000 agn in 216 ks ( @xmath92000 is the _ total _",
    "@xcite number of irac objects in the wedge ) , a factor of 2 higher in detection efficiency .",
    "the x - rays though can help provide a completeness factor for lower luminosity agn which lie outside the wedge .",
    "@xcite deduced a lower limit surface density of 250 agn per deg@xmath61 based on the number of sources in region a from the entire shallow survey data ( corrected by 9% to 275 per deg@xmath61 based on spectroscopy of sources outside the wedge ) .",
    "the x - rays allow us to increase this lower limit by adding the agn from regions b and c , which contain an additional 25% of four band detected sources , raising the lower limit to 350 agn per deg@xmath61 .",
    "another approach is to directly combine the two techniques . with the exception for the stars in region e and the possible contamination of luminous starbursts in region d , 90% of the x - ray sources with 4 channel irac detections are agn accounting for @xmath62 sources from the full x - ray catalog . of these x - ray sources 864",
    "had 4 channel irac detections placing them in region a. of the irac sources there are @xmath63 sources in region a. combining all the sources detected in the ir in region a with all the x - ray sources which are agn ( making sure not to double count the 864 ir detected x - ray sources in region a ) , gives a total of @xmath64 agn for a surface density of 460 agn per deg@xmath61 .",
    "thus , using either approach can help place better limits on the contribution of agn to the cib .",

    "<S> only 2.5% of the sample have no irac counterpart at all based on visual inspection . even for a smaller but a significantly deeper _ chandra _ survey in the same field , the irac shallow survey recovers most of the x - ray sources . a majority ( 65% ) of the _ chandra _ </S>",
