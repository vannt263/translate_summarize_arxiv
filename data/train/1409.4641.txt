    "this is a continuation of the paper @xcite , where the mutation theory in _ exact wkb analysis _ using the framework of _ cluster algebras _ was initiated .",
    "the exact wkb analysis is a method to study the wkb solutions of the schrdinger equation using the borel resummation .",
    "it was initiated by voros @xcite , and developed by aoki , kawai , and takei @xcite , delabaere , dillinger , and pham @xcite , and others .",
    "meanwhile , cluster algebras were introduced by fomin and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "they were originally introduced to study lie theory , but nowadays they are recognized as a common algebraic / combinatorial structure underlying in various areas in mathematics .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main result of @xcite highlighting some key words .",
    "we study the _ wkb solutions _ of the _ schrdinger equation _ on a compact riemann surface .",
    "the principal term of the _ potential _ of the schrdinger equation determines a _ quadratic differential _ on the surface , and the latter further determines a graph on the surface called the _ stokes graph_. the stokes graph plays a central role to study the local and global analytic properties of the wkb solutions , and the _ voros symbols _ describe the monodoromy data of the wkb solutions . under a continuous deformation of the potential ,",
    "the stokes graph may change its topology .",
    "we call this phenomenon the _ mutation _ of stokes graphs",
    ". meanwhile , the stokes graph induces a _ triangulation _ of a bordered surface with marked points in the sense of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mutation of stokes graphs corresponds to the mutation of triangulations called _ signed flips _ and _ signed pops_. these facts provide a natural bridge between exact wkb analysis and cluster algebra theory with the help of the _ surface realization _ of cluster algebras developed by @xcite . along the mutation of stokes graphs ,",
    "the voros symbols also mutate ( or jump ) due to the _ stokes phenomenon_. the main result of @xcite is that the voros symbols mutate as the variables of the corresponding cluster algebra . to be more precise ,",
    "they mutate by _ signed mutations _ and _ signed pops _ of the _ extended seeds _ , which are certain extensions of the ordinary mutation of cluster algebras .    in @xcite",
    "it was technically essential to assume that the schrdinger equation has no turning points of _ simple - pole type _",
    "( _ simple - pole _ for short ) . in this paper",
    "we lift this restriction and treat the case where there are simple poles .",
    "the connection formula of the wkb solutions around a simple pole was obtained by koike @xcite .",
    "this is the counterpart of the celebrated voros connection formula of the wkb solutions around a usual _ turning point_. based on koike s connection formula , we obtain the following results in this paper .",
    "firstly , we obtain the delabaere - dillinger - pham ( ddp ) type jump formula for the voros symbols at the reduction of a stokes segment involving a simple pole ( theorem [ thm : stokes - auto - ii ] ) . our formula is closely related to the result of kamimoto et al .",
    "@xcite ( see remark [ remark : known - results ] ) .",
    "secondly , we reformulate the above jump formula in view of cluster algebra theory , where we have two novel features in contrast to the previous case in @xcite .    * instead of using the surface realization of cluster algebras ,",
    "we need to use the _ orbifold realization _ of cluster algebras by felikson , shapiro , and tumarkin @xcite .",
    "the simple poles correspond to the _ orbifold points _ therein . *",
    "the voros symbols mutate as the variables of _ generalized cluster algebras _ introduced by chekhov and shapiro @xcite instead of ordinary cluster algebras ( theorem [ thm : mut2 ] ) .",
    "to be more precise , they mutate by _ signed mutations _ , which are certain extensions of the ordinary mutation of generalized cluster algebras .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we consider the schrdinger equation on a compact riemann surface especially having simple poles .",
    "then , we obtain the ddp type jump formula for the voros symbols at the reduction of a stokes segment involving a simple pole . in section 3",
    "we show how the above reduction is related to the signed flips of labeled stokes triangulations of an orbifold . in section 4 we reformulate our jump formula in view of the above correspondence to stokes triangulations , and show that the voros symbols mutate as the variables of generalized cluster algebras at the mutation of stokes graphs involving simple poles .",
    "we greatly thank dylan thurston , who suggested us the link between simple poles and orbifold points at the workshop  cluster algebras and related topics \" held at mathematisches forschungsinstitut oberwolfach in december , 2013 .",
    "we also thank anna felikson , anne - sophie gleitz , takahiro kawai , tatsuya koike , michael shapiro and yoshitsugu takei for useful communications and discussions .",
