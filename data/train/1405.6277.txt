    "the braneworld scenarios  @xcite , have attracted more and more attention . because they present new insights and solutions for many issues such as the hierarchy problem , the cosmological problem , the nature of dark matter and dark energy , and so on . in some braneworld scenarios , all the fields in the standard model",
    "are assumed to be trapped on a submanifold ( called brane ) in a higher - dimensional spacetime ( called bulk ) , and only gravity transmits in the whole bulk .",
    "so a natural and interesting question is how to reproduce the effective four - dimensional newtonian gravity from a bulk gravity .    in models with compacted extra dimension , such as the add braneworld model  @xcite , the effective gravity on the brane",
    "is transmitted by the massless graviton kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode ( also called the graviton zero mode ) .",
    "since the graviton zero mode is separated from the first kk excitation by a mass gap , gravity is effectively four - dimensional at low energy . while in models with infinitely large extra dimensions , like the one proposed by randall and sundrum ( the rs2 model )  @xcite ,",
    "although the graviton spectrum is gapless now , the effective gravity on the brane is shown to be the newtonian gravity plus an subdominant correction , so the low energy effective gravity is also four - dimensional  @xcite .",
    "this is because the wave functions of all the massive graviton kk modes are suppressed on the brane , so , the massive modes only contribute a small correction to the newtonian gravity at large distance .",
    "another class of interesting models with infinite extra dimensions is the so called thick branes . in these modes , the original singular thin brane in the rs2 model",
    "is replaced by some smooth thick domain walls generated by one or a few background scalars  @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of thick domain wall brane is that the massive graviton modes feel an effective volcanolike potential , which might support some resonances .",
    "this feature was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "such resonant modes of graviton can be interesting both phenomenlogically and theoretically .",
    "phenomenlogically , the wave function of a graviton resonance peaks at the location of brane and behaviors as a plain wave in the infinity of the extra dimension . as compared to the rs2 model",
    ", the massive modes of a thick brane might contribute a different correction to the newtonian gravity .",
    "on the theoretical aspect , metastable massive graviton in thick brane models provides an alternative for massive gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the early proposal for thick brane  @xcite failed in finding massive graviton resonance .    to construct a model that support graviton resonance",
    ", one has to tune the shape of the effective potential for the graviton . for typical thick brane models , where the gravity is taken as general relativity ,",
    "the only possible way is to tune the shape of the warp factor .",
    "some successful models can be found in refs .",
    "there is another way , however , to tune the effective potential for the graviton if the gravity is described by a more general theory .",
    "for example , in @xmath0 gravity ( see  @xcite for comprehensive reviews on @xmath0 gravity and its applications in cosmology ) , the effective potential is determined by both the warp factor and the form of @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "so , in principle , graviton resonances can be turned on by tuning gravity .    however , the construction of a thick @xmath0-brane model is not easy in practice ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for works on @xmath0-branes ) .",
    "first of all , the dynamical equation in @xmath0-gravity is of fourth order .",
    "so , traditional methods that help us to find analytical brane solutions in second order systems , such as the superpotential method ( also known as the first order formalism  @xcite ) do not work in a general @xmath0-brane model .",
    "usually one can only solve the system either by using numerical method  @xcite , or by imposing strict constraints on the model , for example , by assuming the scalar curvature to be a constant  @xcite .",
    "the linearization of a @xmath0-brane model is also a challenging task .",
    "naively , the linear perturbations around an arbitrary @xmath0-brane solution should also satisfy some fourth order differential equations .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors found that the tensor perturbation perturbation equation can be finally rewritten as a second order schrdinger - like equation .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite enable us to analyse the graviton mass spectrum of any thick @xmath0-branes solutions .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed an analytical thick brane solution in a model with @xmath1 .",
    "the solution is stable against the tensor perturbation .",
    "the localization of zero modes of both graviton and fermion is also shown to be possible .",
    "unfortunately , no graviton resonance was found in the model of ref .",
    "recently , a more general analytical thick @xmath0-brane solution was reported in ref .",
    "the solution of ref .",
    "@xcite is a generalization of the one in  @xcite . the model in ref .",
    "@xcite has an interesting feature : inner brane structure appears for a particular range of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "usually , the appearance of inner brane structure is accompanied by graviton resonances  @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to see if it is possible to find graviton resonances in the model of  @xcite , and what is the relation between the inner brane structure and the graviton resonance .",
    "these two questions constitute the motivation for the present work .    in the next section  [ secmodel ] ,",
    "we briefly review the model and corresponding solutions in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ main ] , we study the localization of the graviton zero mode and the condition for graviton resonances in the model of  @xcite .",
    "the correction from the the massive graviton kk modes at small distance is discussed in order to compare with the constraints of breaking the newton s inverse square law from experiments given in ref .",
    "the conclusion and discussions will be given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we start with the five - dimensional action of the @xmath0 gravity minimally coupled with a canonical scalar field @xmath3 where @xmath0 is a function of the scalar curvature @xmath4 , and @xmath5 with @xmath6 the fundamental five - dimensional planck mass . in the following , we set @xmath7 .",
    "the signature of the metric is taken as @xmath8 , and the bulk coordinates are denoted by capital latin indices , @xmath9 , and the brane coordinates are denoted greek indices , @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in the static minkowski brane embedded in a five - dimensional spacetime , so the line element is assumed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the warp factor , @xmath13 stands for the extra dimension , and @xmath14 is the induced metric on the brane .    for static brane solutions with the setup ( [ metric ] ) ,",
    "the background scalar field @xmath15 is only the function of the extra dimension , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the equations of motion for the @xmath0-brane system are @xmath17 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a toy model with @xmath21 and the @xmath22 potential @xmath23 was considered , where @xmath24 is the self coupling constant of the scalar field , and @xmath25 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field .",
    "an analytical solution was found in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath26 where the parameters are given by @xmath27 the scalar field satisfies @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the potential reaches the minimum ( the vacuum ) at @xmath30 .",
    "the energy density @xmath31 peaks at the location of the brane , @xmath32 , and trends to vanish at the boundary of the extra dimension .",
    "the brane is embedded in an anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "the tensor perturbation of the above brane solution has been analyzed in ref .",
    "it was shown that the solution is stable against the tensor perturbation and the gravity zero mode is localized on the brane .",
    "furthermore , it was found that although there are fermion resonant kk modes on the brane , there are no graviton resonant modes @xcite .",
    "recently , a general solution was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the same @xmath0 given in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) .",
    "the warp factor is assumed as the general form of ( [ ay1 ] ) with two positive parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 the corresponding ricci tensor at the boundary of the extra dimension is given by @xmath36 from which we can see that the background spacetime is asymptotical ads with the effective cosmological constant @xmath37 .",

    "so @xmath32 is an inflection point of @xmath47 when @xmath48 , and the brane will have an internal structure when @xmath49 . the energy density @xmath50 of the brane system is shown in fig .",

    "in this section , we investigate the stability of solution against tensor fluctuation of the metric as well as localization of gravity on the brane .",
    "especially , we will find that the effective potential for the kk modes of the tensor fluctuation has a rich structure and it will support some resonant kk modes when @xmath33 is large enough and @xmath63 .",
    "we start with the transverse - traceless ( tt ) tensor perturbations of the background spacetime : @xmath64 where @xmath65 depends on all the spacetime coordinates and satisfies the tt condition @xmath66 it can be shown that the tt tensor perturbations @xmath67 is decoupled from the scalar and vector perturbations of the metric as well as the perturbation of the scalar field @xmath68 .",
    "the perturbed einstein equations for the tt tensor perturbations are given by @xcite @xmath69 or , equivalently , @xmath70 where @xmath71 . by making the coordinate transformation @xmath72 ,",

    "( [ schrodinger ] ) , the solution of the zero mode with @xmath84 is @xmath85 it is easy to show that @xmath86 is normalizable , i.e. , @xmath87 which implies that the zero mode is localized on the brane . here",
    "we note that if @xmath88 has solution @xmath89 , then the effective potentials @xmath90 would has singularities at @xmath89 and the corresponding zero mode vanishes at that point .",
    "we note here that by doing the kk reduction for the zero mode we will get the following relation between the effective four - dimensional planck mass @xmath91 and the fundamental five - dimensional planck mass @xmath6 : @xmath92 which results in the effective four - dimensional general relativity .",
    "hence , it is natural to set @xmath91 , @xmath6 and @xmath34 as the same scale ( as did in rs-2 model ) @xmath93 so that there is no hierarchy between them .",
    "note that @xmath108 appears in the denominator of the expression of @xmath79 ( [ wz ] ) or @xmath109 ( [ wzy ] ) . for general relativity , we have @xmath110 and so the effective potential @xmath109 is always regular for a smooth solution of the thick brane .",
    "however , for the @xmath0 gravity with @xmath111 , @xmath112 may be vanishing and the effective potential will be divergent , i.e. , @xmath113\\!=\\!0 \\label{criticaleq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will lead to the singularities of the effective potential @xmath90 .",
    "this will result in two @xmath114-like potential wells which are related to the appearance of the resonant kk modes of the tensor perturbations .",

    "it is clear that large relative probabilities @xmath158 of finding massive kk modes within a narrow range @xmath159 around the brane location indicate the existence of resonant modes .    from fig .",

    "the correction can be neglected . for the case of @xmath194 with multiple resonances ,",
    "the analysis and method are similar .",
    "because the value of @xmath181 inevitably trends to be @xmath195 when the parameter @xmath184 approaches to infinite , the leading correction to newton s law at a large - distance @xmath193 is also proportional to @xmath196 . at a short - distance @xmath197 ,",
    "the leading term is @xmath198 .",
    "the effect of the resonant modes occurs at a few planck lengths .",

    "the reason is that the quasiwell of the effective potential is not deep enough .",
    "this is different from the brane models in general relativity , for which there are usually resonant modes when the brane has an internal structure @xcite .",
    "however , the effective potential may have a rich structure with singularities and it will support a series of resonant kk modes when @xmath33 is large enough ( @xmath122 ) and @xmath63 , although the brane has no inner structure anymore .",
