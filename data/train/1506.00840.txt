    "the discovery of the 125-gev higgs boson with properties consistent with standard model ( sm ) predictions eventually proves the validity of the sm .",
    "new physics should reside at a sufficiently high mass scale and/or interact with the sm particles through very small couplings , so that it does not affect the sm sector significantly .",
    "thus an effective field theory ( eft ) of the sm , with all fields appearing in the operators being only the sm ones and all the new physics integrated out , would be an ideal tool to study the low energy physics .",
    "today it is well known that going beyond the only dimension-5 operator in the seesaw mechanism , up to dimension-6 level such an eft consists a total of 59 independent operators  @xcite for one family of fermions as a complete basis , while five more can be added if baryon number violation is allowed .    in the sm eft collider or other experiment observables",
    "can be calculated to the lowest order of the dimension-6 operators  @xcite , and a global fit  @xcite will determine the wilson coefficients of the operators in a model independent way . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested in a specific model , then translating these model independent constraints to model parameters calls for another kind of matching .",
    "the most famous example is the peskin - takeuchi oblique corrections of @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters  @xcite parameter defined there corresponds to dimension-8 operator . ] , and the @xmath2 parameter can even date back to the context of weak charged current and neutral current ratio in the form of @xmath3 parameter .",
    "another example is the higgs diphoton decay branching ratio calculations in the early days of higgs discovery , hinted by the atlas and cms measured higgs diphoton channel signal strength . in the following",
    "we will see how they are equivalent to the wilson coefficients of the dimension-6 operators .",
    "usually the calculations are done case by case , using the traditional feynman diagram approach . to the best knowledge of the author ,",
    "the first `` systematic '' dimension-6 operator calculations are given in  @xcite .",
    "instead of the feynman diagram technique , they use the so called covariant  @xcite derivative expansion  @xcite ( cde ) of the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) potential  @xcite , which has the merit of generating all the dimension-6 sm operators automatically at one - loop level , including the oblique @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the higgs relevant ones and all the other ones involving the higgs and sm gauge bosons . in this paper",
    "we will apply the same technique to a prototype of fermionic model , namely a mirror vector - like ( vl ) fermion sector . by definition",
    "the mirror vl fermion should contain both doublet and two singlets of @xmath4 , but we consider them to be in arbitrary representation ( denoted as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 _ etc _ ) of the @xmath7 and the @xmath4 doublet to carry arbitrary @xmath8 hypercharge @xmath9 .",
    "guided by appendix of  @xcite , the fermionic cde has extra @xmath0 matrix related contributions .",
    "trace over the @xmath0 matrix space immediately picks out combinations of only even number of @xmath0 matrices , leaving odd number ones vanishing .",
    "it is like another `` power counting '' in addition to the one of dimension of the operators , and the bosonic cde corresponds only to the case of no @xmath0 matrix .",
    "we will see that up to dimension-6 operators there are only two @xmath0 and four @xmath0 matrices contribution in extra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : for ] , we list the dimension-6 operators and the bosonic cde formula , then we generalize it to the fermionic case by working out all possible extra @xmath0 matrix related terms . then in section  [ sec : res ] we define the vl fermion model and show the main analytical results , as well as some numerical results for the most interesting vl lepton and quark model .",
    "we discuss the formulism and conclude in section  [ sec : dis ] . at last ,",
    "appendix  [ sec : col ] provides a complete list of contributing combinations , operator by operator in the dimension-6 operator basis and term by term in the cde , in order to facilitate future calculation .",

    "[ fig : l ] we show the numerical constraints for a vl lepton sector , in which we set the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the oblique @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameter constraints , the higgs diphoton branching ratio calculations in  @xcite now is turned over to a constraint as well . mostly probing the @xmath26 direction or so , our results are complementary to the direct vl lepton search , which has a mass bound of about @xmath27  gev  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] we show the numerical constraints for a vl quark sector . for small vl mass",
    "the constraint curves scale more like @xmath28 , and indeed the @xmath29 is dominated by @xmath30 contribution to the gluon fusion in the current lhc data . as the vl mass increase the constraint is weaker in the direction of @xmath31 , which is an indication that the oblique correction @xmath2 parameter is becoming more and more dominant in that case .",
    "since every higgs field is accompanied by a yukawa coupling in the cde , the wilson coefficient of a four higgs operator such as @xmath32 will scale quartically with the yukawa coupling , being very sensitive except for the @xmath31 direction , in case that the yukawa couplings are large .",

    "the cde of the cw potential provides a systematic tool of matching the uv theory to the sm eft , all the wilson coefficients of the dimension-6 operators are calculated if we enumerate all the contributing patterns in the cde .",
    "the merit of the cde of cw potential approach includes :    * complete : up to pure higgs and gauge field operators , all the wilson coefficients of the dimension-6 operators are calculated as long as there is a contribution . on the other hand",
    ", it can match uv theory to redundant operators , then one can perform field redefinition or use equation of motion to remove redundant operators later on , as one wish . *",
    "analytical : the cde do not need to know the mass eigenstates and rotation matrices from interaction eigenstate basis to mass eigenstate basis .",
    "the complication of mixing is equivalent to the non - commutative nature of the matrices of @xmath34 with each other and with matrices of @xmath35 . and the final results of the wilson coefficients in forms of some power of couplings divided by large mass squares , are equivalent to expanding the interaction - to - mass - eigenstate mixing matrix to power of @xmath36 . *",
    "model independent formulism : the input is just the bsm particles coupling matrices to the higgs and sm gauge bosons , and all the following calculation are identical for different model .",
    "different from the feynman diagram approach ( together with the interaction - to - mass - eigenstate mixing ) , the cde always gives only the leading terms in expansion of large mass square suppression .",
    "the expansion is also precise in case that the bsm coupling is small . even if the current experiments are still exploring a region",
    "in which the eligibility of the cde is questionable , as the experiments goes to higher and higher precisions and energies , if no deviation from the sm is detected , the eligibility of the cde will become better and better .    so far the cde is only calculated for the case that all the large masses are equal , and the matrix of the large scale square is proportional to an identity matrix so that commute with @xmath34 .",
    "it is not hard to generalize it to the case that the large masses are nondegenerate  @xcite , if we keep track carefully of the order of the generally non - commutative matrices .",
