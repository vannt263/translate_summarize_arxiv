    "<S> introduction : _ polymers confined to spaces much smaller than their radius of gyration are common in biological systems such as dna packed in viral capsids  @xcite or in the nucleus of a cell  @xcite . both the geometrical structure and the dynamical behavior of strongly confined polymers are of considerable interest because of their role in biological functions . </S>",
    "<S> one of the first theoretical models for such phases is flory s _ compact polymer model _ ( cpm )  @xcite which describes a polymer by a hamiltonian walk on a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this two - dimensional model is relevant for polymers on surfaces  @xcite such as dna adsorbed on a lipid bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamics of flory compact polymers on the square lattice has been studied using field theoretical methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> little is known , however , about the geometrical structure of compact polymers . moreover , despite the fact that the flory s cpm was introduced more than fifty years ago , the dynamics of the model has not been studied so far .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we use a mapping of the compact polymer on the manhattan lattice to spanning trees  @xcite to address the problems above . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping allows us to obtain an exact analytical expression for the average number of bends and then calculate the energy of the system in a high temperature approximation . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we uncover a deep universal connection between the dynamics of compact polymers and their geometric structure . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the extension and retraction of geometric features called _ fingers _ as the main mechanism for the relaxation of compact polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the mapping to the spanning trees to endow the flory s model with physically motivated kinetic rules . </S>",
    "<S> we find aging and slow relaxation in the quench dynamics of the system and argue that the slow relaxation stems from the geometrical correlations between the energy and the number of fingers . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation phenomenology presented in this paper gives a universal description of polymer dynamics under strong geometric confinement .    </S>",
    "<S> _ model and thermodynamics : _ the _ compact _ polymer is modeled as a hamiltonian cycle , i.e.  a self - avoiding loop which visits every site , on the manhattan lattice ( a square lattice with successive parallel lines oriented in alternating directions ) with lattice spacing @xmath0 . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapping ] , there is a one - to - one correspondence between polymer configurations and spanning trees on a square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a spanning tree is a connected graph that visits every site of this new lattice without forming loops .        </S>",
    "<S> hereafter we work with the lattice underlying the trees and assume it has @xmath2 sites . in a tree , </S>",
    "<S> a vertex can have coordination @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; sites with coordination @xmath4 can have the two bonds either `` aligned '' ( coordination @xmath7 ) or `` bent '' ( coordination @xmath8 ) . denoting the number of sites with coordination @xmath9 by @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 we assume periodic boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> so there are @xmath12 bonds on the lattice with @xmath13 bonds belonging to the tree . for a given polymer configuration , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the bending energy and the elastic energy due to length fluctuations . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : site ] , vertices of the tree with coordination @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to the polymer having @xmath4 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 bends respectively .     and @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> if we consider a polymer whose unstretched length is twice the length of the tree , and assume that the bends are rounded with a radius @xmath18 , we can show using elementary geometry that the sites with coordination @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 contribute to the length fluctuation by @xmath19 , @xmath14 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the length fluctuation for a site with coordination @xmath3 is equal to the length of the curve shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , width=4 ]    using the above fluctuations and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ constraint ] ) , it can be shown that the total length fluctuation depends only on @xmath23 and is given by @xmath24 . by adding the corresponding elastic energy to the bending energy , we get for the total energy of the system @xmath25 where the spring constant of the polymer is @xmath26 . to find the average number of bends @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> we need @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the probability of a site belonging to the tree having coordination @xmath9 .    [ [ section ] ]    the probabilities @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath28 were calculated in reference  @xcite using kirchhoff s matrix - tree theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that because of constraints in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ constraint ] ) , only two of these four probabilities are independent . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 we also need @xmath29 , which we calculate below . </S>",
    "<S> kirchhoff s theorem states that the number of spanning trees on a graph is given by any cofactor ( they are all equal ) of its laplacian matrix . </S>",

    "<S> [ relation ] , @xmath45{prob1.eps}}\\end{picture } \\right)\\equiv p_c$ ] is equal to ratio of the number of spanning trees on a square lattice with two adjacent horizontal bonds removed and the total number of spanning trees on the original square lattice . denoting the associated laplacian matrices by @xmath46 ( the lattice minus two bonds ) and @xmath47 ( the lattice ) </S>",
    "<S> , we have according to the matrix tree theorem @xmath48 . using the identity @xmath49 , the ratio of cofactors can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the regularized inverse laplacian . noticing that the laplacian of the square lattice is diagonal in fourier space we have  @xcite @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> since the matrix @xmath53 describes a change in the connectivity of @xmath5 sites , it only has a @xmath54 nonzero block . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath55 can be calculated by evaluating the determinant of a @xmath54 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we can then obtain @xmath29 using @xmath31 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ p ] and the result is @xmath56 , in the limit of an infinite lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the thermodynamic limit , the average number of bends in a closed compact polymer @xmath57 can be finally calculated and is given by @xmath58    [ [ section-1 ] ]    the above probabilities have been computed assuming all configurations are equally likely ( infinite temperature ) . for finite high temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the system can be obtained as follows : for @xmath59 , let us define @xmath60 as the probability distribution function that a tree configuration has @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath60 has a peak at @xmath62 and we have numerically validated a gaussian approximation for the fluctuations around the mean value of @xmath62 with standard deviations scaling as @xmath63 by generating random spanning trees using broder s algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the distribution function of @xmath23 is approximated by a gaussian peaked at @xmath27 given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 has been obtained numerically . within the gaussian approximation  ( [ f_m ] ) , the partition function @xmath66 where the number of spanning trees on a square lattice with @xmath35 sites asymptotically scales as @xmath67  @xcite with @xmath68 . from the partition function , </S>",
    "<S> the average energy of the system in the thermodynamic limit and at inverse temperature @xmath69 is obtained as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a characteristic elastic energy . in the absence of length fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , the energy reduces to @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> notice however that because of the high - temperature nature of the approximation , this equation does not hold for arbitrarily large @xmath74 ( the total energy can not be negative ) and it does not capture the melting transition the system  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    the system has a melting transition  @xcite since the polymer is disordered at infinite temperature and the @xmath75 configurations are ordered as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ground ] . to find the transition temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we define the phenomenological order parameter @xmath76 , with @xmath77 and @xmath78 the number of vertical and horizontal bonds in a macroscopic ( but not too large ) region of size @xmath79 . calculating the binder cumulant @xmath80  @xcite for @xmath81 to identify the transition </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the cumulant using an ensemble average with @xmath83 realizations obtained by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the specific heat obtained numerically has a peak close to the transition whose finite size scaling indicates no thermodynamic limit divergence . </S>",
    "<S> this is suggestive of a kosterlitz - thouless transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is analogous to that of  @xcite where the compact polymer lives on the square rather than the manhattan lattice .        _ </S>",
    "<S> quench dynamics and aging : _ in this section we study the dynamics of a compact polymer . </S>",
    "<S> notice that for a single strongly - confined polymer , the center of mass does not diffuse and the system dynamics is characterized only by reshaping . in order to study the dynamics of the system , we need to endow the flory s model with some kinetic rules </S>",
    "<S> . these should represent the actual motion of the polymer rather than just transform the configurations as needed for thermodynamic mc studies . in reference  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we studied the dynamics of a confined single polymer using a microscopic model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the reshaping of strongly confined polymers takes place primarily through _ fingering events _ in which a finger retracts and another finger extends to fill the void ( fig .  [ fig : finger ] ) .        in the language of the trees , </S>",
    "<S> a fingering event is a local bond flip at a site with coordination one : a bond is added to one of the three empty edges while the original bond emanating from the coordination - one site is removed from the tree . since a fingering event involves the collective motion of many monomers , this dynamics is greatly accelerated . for a given move </S>",
    "<S> the change in the system energy @xmath84 depends only on the change in the coordination of the sites involved in the bond flip . to satisfy detailed balance we use glauber - like dynamics where the rate @xmath18 of a flip is proportional to @xmath85 . as explained in reference  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> although the shape of the polymer is modified locally , the actual polymer undergoes global motion through reptation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in addition to the energetics , a kinetic factor controls the rate at which the moves take place . to find the kinetic factor in the language of the trees , consider one fingering event . in a closed polymer </S>",
    "<S> there are two paths for monomers to flow from the retracting finger to the extending one ; both paths contribute to the motion but in the thermodynamic limit , reptation essentially takes place along the shorter path of length @xmath86 . in order to create a new finger , the excess length coming from the retracting finger diffuses along the shorter path of length @xmath86 with a diffusion constant proportional to @xmath87  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the polymer reptates a fixed distance for each fingering event , we have @xmath88 . adding a bond to the tree ( representing the extending finger ) creates one and only one loop . </S>",
    "<S> this loop partitions the system into two regions of areas @xmath89 and @xmath90 , each containing one of the two polymer paths . for a path lying inside a region of area @xmath91 , the length of the reptating polymer is then @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the perimeter of the region and @xmath94 is the number of lattice sites inside it </S>",
    "<S> . the rate @xmath18 will then be proportional to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics we have introduced above is `` non - local '' in the sense that for every move a non - local quantity @xmath96 needs to be computed . </S>",
    "<S> a faster , `` local '' dynamics can be implemented by substituting @xmath97 with the infinite - temperature average @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the same thermodynamics and similar dynamical features as for the non - local dynamics are obtained .    with open boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> , we can show that , in the thermodynamic limit , the region with smaller area is the _ inside _ of the loop formed by adding a bond . at infinite temperature , this is a consequence of that fact the probability of forming loops of area @xmath91 decays asymptotically as @xmath99  @xcite . at low temperatures , the typical loop area @xmath96 scales as the linear size of the ordered domains which is much smaller than @xmath100 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-3 ] ]    using both the local and the non - local dynamics , we study the response of an ensemble of spanning trees to a sudden quench from infinite temperature to a non - vanishing inverse temperature @xmath69 . in the simulations we only consider the bending rigidity and </S>",
    "<S> neglect the elastic energy ; temperatures are measured in natural units where @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure how the average @xmath102 and @xmath103 decay as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> since the dynamics takes place only through fingering events at the leaves of the tree ( the mobile nodes ) , @xmath103 is related to the system mobility . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dynamics ] , for small values of @xmath69 the energy decays steadily to its equilibrium value whereas for larger @xmath69 a broad plateau emerges . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 has a similar behavior . </S>",
    "<S> all plateaus emerge at approximately the same value of @xmath104 and @xmath105 for different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented are for @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> a parallel study for @xmath107 indicates no system size dependence up to the time - scales we studied . for quenches to temperatures which allow the system to equilibrate within our simulation times , the system size independence of the relaxation time holds during the whole evolution . </S>",
    "<S> for quenches to lower temperatures , we observe that the time evolution is the same for the two different system sizes until the early stages of the secondary relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale necessary to reach complete ordering at such low temperatures is indeed expected to depend on the system size but such time scales are not accessible to our simulations .        </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical features we observe can be explained by noting that none of the moves which decrease the energy increase the number of mobile nodes @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , as the system decreases its energy , the average distance between mobile nodes grows , freezing larger and larger parts of the system . </S>",
    "<S> also , mobile nodes can be created or annihilated only if they are nearest neighbor to another mobile node and they can diffuse only by hopping over another mobile node . at zero temperature , only the moves that _ do not increase _ </S>",
    "<S> the energy are allowed and the plateau emerges once the moves that _ decrease _ the energy are exhausted . while in the plateau , the system is exploring its phase space with the moves that _ do not change _ the energy and a secondary decay begins only once the cooperative reshaping due to such moves has made further energy - decreasing moves accessible . at finite low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is similar , although the finite probability of energy - increasing moves shortens the plateau . </S>",
    "<S> a relaxation mechanism governed by fingers and the slow dynamics due to the geometric correlation between the number of fingers and the system energy are generic dynamical features which do not depend on the details of the model . </S>",
    "<S> notably , with the non - local dynamics , @xmath23 and @xmath103 decay into a plateau of the same height as for the local dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the decay , however , happens more slowly since the average loop area controlling the decay rate increases with time .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-4 ] ]     for @xmath108 . , width=12 ]    we now define a shape - shape correlation function for the system @xmath109 , where @xmath110 if the configuration of bonds emanating from site @xmath37 are exactly the same at times @xmath111 and @xmath112 and zero otherwise . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : aging ] , the system decorrelates more slowly for longer waiting times @xmath111 . the aging in the system is characterized by domain coarsening . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : visualization ] , the ordered equilibrium state below the critical temperature consists primarily of a domain of horizontal or vertical bonds . when the system is driven out of equilibrium several ordered domains persist for long times ( plateau ) and undergo a slow coarsening during the secondary decay ( aging ) .     to @xmath113 . </S>",

    "<S> , width=18 ]    [ [ section-5 ] ]    _ summary and outlook : _ </S>",
    "<S> we used a mapping to spanning trees to calculate quantities related to the geometrical structure of flory s compact polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the dynamics of compact polymers is closely related to their geometric structure due to the role of fingers in reshaping . formulating the dynamics in terms of the collective polymer reshaping , we endowed the model with physically motivated kinetics in the convenient framework of the trees . </S>",
    "<S> our accelerated dynamics gives access to the long - time out - of - equilibrium phenomenology of compact polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the system exhibits slow dynamics and aging characterized by the coarsening of ordered domains when quenched to low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we presented a generic phenomenological picture for the dynamics of strongly confined polymers by noting that the key to the slow relaxation is the geometrical correlations between the number of fingers and the system energy . even in the continuum , where fingers do not have a rigorous definition , </S>",
    "<S> fingering events are a generic mechanism driving the relaxation dynamics of polymers  @xcite and qualitative dynamical features such as domain coarsening and aging found in our paper are not expected to depend on the details of the lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative results like the number of bends however are specific to the lattice studied in the paper . our model could be extended to study a fully - packed melt of loop polymers instead of single chain by using a mapping to a spanning forest and appropriate kinetic rules . </S>",
    "<S> similar studies in the context of non - compact polymers have been done on a related problem of chains diffusing in an array of obstacles  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were carried out on boston university supercomputer facilities . </S>",
