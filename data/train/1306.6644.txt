    "the variety and robustness of current astronomical data provide not only the possibility of constraining cosmological parameters but also of testing some fundamental hypotheses in cosmology .",
    "one of these hypotheses is the validity of the so - called cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) ( ellis 1971 , 2007 ) , widely assumed in observational cosmology .",
    "concisely speaking , the cddr is derived from etherington reciprocity theorem ( etherington 1933 ) , which holds if photons follow null ( unique ) geodesic and the geodesic deviation equation is valid , along with the assumption that the number of photon is conserved over the cosmic evolution ( see bassett et al .",
    "2004 ; uzan et al .",
    "2004 ; gonalves et al . 2012 ; ellis et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "if such assumptions hold in our universe , the luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and angular diameter ( @xmath4 ) distances of sources at a given redshift @xmath5 are related by @xmath6 a non - validation of cddr ( @xmath7 ) would be a clear evidence of new physics which could arise from different physical mechanisms . among others ,",
    "some examples are : a possible variation of fundamental constants ( jaeckel & ringwald , 2010 ) , birefringence from photons ( adler 1971 ) , a non - metric theory of gravity , a non - conservation of the number of photons due to absorption by dust ( bassett et al .",
    "2004 ) , photon - axion oscillation in an external magnetic field ( cski et al . 2002 ) or an interactive cosmological creation process ( lima et al .",
    "2000 ) , among others ( see , e.g. , brax et al . 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the empirical validity of the cddr has been explored using different methods . in some cases , a cosmological model suggested by a set of observations",
    "is assumed to place bounds on the duality parameter @xmath8 ( uzan et al .",
    "2004 ; avgoustidis et al .",
    "cosmological model - independent tests have also been performed using @xmath4 measurements from galaxy clusters , obtained from their x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich observations , and luminosity distances @xmath3 from type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) ( holanda et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ; nair et al . 2011",
    "; cardone et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this context , gonalves et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that x - ray measurements of the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters ( gc s ) depend explicitly on the validity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and discussed how these measurements together with sne ia observations can be used to test the cddr .",
    "other cosmological model - independent tests have been proposed by using sne ia observations with opacity - free distance modulus obtained from hubble parameter data ( holanda et al .",
    "it is important to note that most of the methods above mentioned are potentially contaminated by different systematics error sources present in galaxy clusters , sne ia observations and hubble parameter data .",
    "a consistent model - independent test for cddr that uses only observations of the gas mass fraction of gc s was proposed in holanda , gonalves & alcaniz ( 2012 ) ( from now on hga ) .",
    "the basic idea is that , while current gc s gas mass fraction obtained from x - ray observations ( @xmath9 ) depends explicitly on the duality relation , sunyaev - zeldovich observations ( @xmath10 ) of the very same quantity do not , which allows a direct comparison of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a test for the cddr .",
    "currently only 38 galaxy clusters have their gas mass fraction obtained from x - ray and microwave bands ( la roque et al .",
    "these observations provide tight but not definitive constraints on the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "our goal in this paper is , therefore , to answer the following question : by assuming the current observational error distribution and the respective bounds on the @xmath8 parameter , how many data points are needed to check the validity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) at a given confidence level ?",
    "we provide an answer to this question performing monte carlo simulations with different sample sizes and characteristics . we also discuss how an improvement on the @xmath9 and @xmath10 measurements could help answer the above question . in what follows",
    ", we outline the main assumptions of our analysis and discuss the main results .",
    "in order to analyze the validity of cddr , we follow hga and combine measurements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 to obtain estimates of the @xmath8 parameter .    as is well known , to estimate the x - ray gas mass fraction of gc s we define a gas density profile for the electron in the core of the cluster . in general , it is assumed the model based on a spherical @xmath12-model ( cavaliere & fusco - fermiano 1978 ) to the electron density profile .",
    "taking the luminosity emitted from the galaxy cluster by bremsstrahlung emission ( sarazin 1988 ) and assuming a hydrostatic equilibrium of the total mass of the cluster , it is possible to obtain measurements of gas mass fraction from x - ray observations ( sasaki 1996 ; allen et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; ettori et al .",
    "2009 ) , where the electron density of the core is written as ( la roque et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath13 in the above expression , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the flux in x - ray , the mean molecular weight of hydrogen , the mean molecular weight of electrons , the power law index from @xmath12 model , the x - ray cooling function and the angular diameter of the core . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it is clear that the density of electron in the core depends on the cddr parameter since it depends explicitly on the ratio @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the gas mass fraction obtained via x - ray measurements is affected by a possible violation of cddr ( gonalves et al . 2012 ) .",
    "on the other hand , combining measurements of the decrement of the cmb temperature ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) as it propagates through the intracluster medium with the shape of the x - ray spectra provides @xmath10 measurements . in this case",
    "( la roque et al . 2006 ) , @xmath20 where the parameters are @xmath21 ( the variation of temperature in the core ) , @xmath22 ( electron mass ) , @xmath23 ( a function that accounts for frequency shift and relativistic corrections ) , @xmath24 ( cmb temperature ) , @xmath25 ( boltzmann constant ) and @xmath26 ( gas temperature )",
    ". measurements of gas mass fraction from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect do not have a clear dependence on the cddr measurements are redshift - independent only if there is no process of energy injection into the cmb . in cosmologies with photon creation or destruction , the standard linear relation @xmath27 is not valid and changes are needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : szne0 ] ) . ] . since",
    "current @xmath9 measurements have been obtained by assuming the validity of the cddr , a direct combinations of the above equations with other observational quantities provides a general expression relating current x - ray and sze observations , namely , @xmath28 we refer the reader to hga for a complete derivation of the above expression and a detailed discussion .",
    "in our analysis , we use a subset of @xmath11 data provided by la roque et al .",
    "our sample is composed of @xmath29 measurements obtained via x - ray and sze observations .",
    "the x - ray data were obtained from the chandra x - ray observatory and sze data from the bima / ovro sze imaging project , which uses the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) and owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) interferometers to image the sze .",
    "the original data set contains 38 data points spanning redshifts from @xmath30 up to @xmath31 , but we excluded 9 points that do not have a good agreement with a smooth description of their density profile and with the hydrostatic equilibrium model .",
    "the galaxy clusters excluded from our sample are _ abell 665 _ , _ zw 3146 _ , _ rx j1347.5 - 1145 _ , _ ms 1358.4 + 6245 _ , _ abell 1835 _ , _ macs j1423 + 2404 _ , _ abell 1914 _ , _ abell 2163 _ , _ abell 2204 _ whose observations present a reduced @xmath32 ranging between @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed discussion about the statistical and systematic errors of these x - ray and sze observations can be found in bonamente et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    as commented by hga",
    ", @xmath11 obtained via sze is not completely independent of x - ray observations , since the shape parameters of the gas density model ( core radius and @xmath12 parameter ) are obtained from a joint analysis of the x - ray and sze data ( bonamente et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , current simulations ( hallman et al .",
    "2007 ) have shown that such parameters , when obtained separately by sze and x - ray observations , agrees at 1 @xmath34 level within a radius @xmath35 ( at which the mean enclosed mass density is equal to 2500 cosmological critical density ) , the same used in the la roque et al .",
    "( 2006 ) observations .",
    "therefore , one can use the la roque et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample to perform analysis with the method discussed earlier .    in order to run our simulations and perform the statistical analyses in the next section ,",
    "we need to define a proper parametrization for @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth noting that any parametrization adopted must satisfy the condition @xmath36 since at very low-@xmath5 @xmath37 . in our analysis",
    ", we consider the following three parameterizations : @xmath38 figure 1 shows the cddr parameter @xmath8 as a function of @xmath5 obtained from current @xmath9 and @xmath10 observations ( open circles ) .",
    "the best - fit curves for parameterizations p1 , p2 and p3 are also shown .",
    "the current @xmath11 observations do not provide a definite answer about the validity of the cddr ( gonalves , holanda & alcaniz 2012 ) .",
    "however , using the method described above [ see eq .",
    "( [ method ] ) ] , it is expected that upcoming observations with larger number and more precise data will be able to test the cddr more accurately . in",
    "what follows , by assuming the observational uncertainty of the current @xmath11 observations , we discuss how large should the upcoming @xmath11 samples be in order to check the validity of the cddr at a given confidence level .    to this end",
    ", we run monte carlo simulations and generate synthetic samples of @xmath39 measurements in the redshift interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the process of simulation can be described as follows . to begin with , we assume a parametrization for @xmath39 and make a @xmath32 analysis to obtain the best fit value of @xmath41 from the observational data set .",
    "we also calculate the relative error ( @xmath42 ) and fit a straight line in order to find its dependence on redshift .",
    "the simulated sample of @xmath39 is obtained by drawing @xmath43 random values of @xmath41 from a normal distribution centered at the fitted value of @xmath41 and with standard deviation equal to the data dispersion .",
    "the points are equally spaced in the redshift interval [ 0.1 , 1 ] .",
    "similarly , the error bars for each simulated point are drawn from a normal distribution with a mean value equal to the dispersion of the real data and taking into account the previously found redshift dependence .",
    "the next step is to make a @xmath32 statistical analysis of the synthetic data ( with respective errors ) and obtain the best fit value of @xmath41 for each sample .",
    "we repeat this process @xmath44 times and calculate the mean and standard deviation for this group of best fit .",
    "the process is repeated for different values of @xmath43 in order to study the effect of sample size on the determination of @xmath41 . for the sake of illustration , one monte carlo realization of 29 values of the cddr parameter ( filled squares )",
    "is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the simulation process above provides the number of data points @xmath0 necessary to check the validity of the cddr for a specific parametrization , with a fiducial value of @xmath41 . in order to find @xmath0",
    ", we adopt the criterion @xmath45 where @xmath46 corresponds to the confidence level required . for the @xmath39 parameterizations discussed earlier [ eqs .",
    "( [ ps ] ) ] , we find the following results for @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) ( see figs .",
    "2a-2c ) :    @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 which shows a clear dependence of @xmath0 with the parameterization adopted . for completeness",
    ", we also perform simulations for different fiducial values of @xmath41 , i.e. , changing this value in our simulation process .",
    "as expected , the closer to zero this latter value the larger @xmath0 .",
    "these results are shown in figures 3a-3c ( black lines ) for parameterizations p1 , p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noticing that the above results are somehow conservative since no improvement on the upcoming @xmath11 data was considered to derive the above values of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , an interesting question worth asking is : what is the influence of the uncertainties @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the estimates of @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer to this question is also shown in figures 3a-3c for parameterization p1 , p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "blue lines represent a reduction of @xmath54 on @xmath52 relative to the la roque et al .",
    "sample whereas red lines represent a reduction of @xmath54 on @xmath53 .",
    "a reduction of @xmath54 on both @xmath52 and @xmath53 from the current data is also shown ( green lines ) . clearly , @xmath10 observations are the major source of uncertainty to test the cddr from the method described in sec .",
    "2 . according to ( [ criterion ] )",
    ", we also note that reducing the current uncertainty on @xmath52 and @xmath53 by @xmath54 the current number of data points would be already enough to check the validity of the cddr at 2@xmath34 level .",
    "testing the cddr constitutes an important task for cosmology and fundamental physics . in this paper , we have adopted the method proposed in hga ( sec .",
    "ii ) and forecasted constraints on the cddr parameter from monte carlo simulations .",
    "initially , we have assumed the present observational error distribution , generated samples of gas mass fraction in the redsfhit interval @xmath55 $ ] and derive @xmath39 values using a direct relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 [ eq .",
    "( [ method ] ) ] .",
    "for the three parameterizations adopted in our analysis , we have found that the minimum number of data points necessary to validate the cddr at 2@xmath34 level should be from 5 to 10 times larger than the current observational sample .",
    "we have also analyzed the influence of the observational errors in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 observations on our results .",
    "regardless of the parameterization adopted , we have found that the major source of uncertainty comes from @xmath10 measurements , with @xmath0 being reduced by a factor of 4 when @xmath53 decreases by half .",
    "these results clearly show that a combination between quantity and precision of future @xmath11 measurements can become a fundamental tool to check the validity of the cddr and explore its consequences .",
