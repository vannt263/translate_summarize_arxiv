    "normal surface singularities that can be projected birationally to a non - singular surface are known as _ sandwiched _ singularities .",
    "they are rational singularities and among them , are included all cyclic quotients and minimal surface singularities . given the germ of a sandwiched singularity @xmath0 , there exist several birational morphisms from it to a non - singular surface .",
    "any such birational projection @xmath5 determines a complete @xmath6-primary ideal @xmath7 so that @xmath8 is the surface obtained by blowing - up @xmath9 along @xmath10 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "such a birational projection determines also ( and is in turn determined by ) an exceptional curve on @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is the study of the local geometry of the exceptional curves of such projections .",
    "we give necessary conditions for a curve on @xmath0 to be the exceptional locus of a birational projection to a non - singular surface .",
    "these results complement in some sense those of @xcite , where the topological types of the ideals determined by such birational projections were characterized .",
    "we will make use of the theory of clusters of infinitely near points and its connection with the theory of complete ideals in a regular local ring of dimension two ( see @xcite ) and the study of sandwiched singularities ( see @xcite ) .",

    ". then we derive consequences .",
    "first , we show that the dimension of the tangent space to the exceptional divisor of @xmath8 at @xmath4 is maximal ( theorem [ tangent_space ] ) i.e. it equals the number of its irreducible components meeting at @xmath4 .",
    "it also follows that the reduced exceptional curve at @xmath4 has only smooth branches with independent tangencies , so it has only minimal singularities ( corollary [ excep_minimal ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have that for any birational projection @xmath3 of @xmath0 to a non - singular surface , the number @xmath18 of branches at @xmath0 being contracted by @xmath3 satisfies @xmath19 in section 4 we give a formula for the number @xmath20 of branches of a generic hypersurface section through @xmath0 in terms of the base points of @xmath10 ( proposition [ branches ] ) . from it , we show that there exists no birational projections of @xmath0 to a non - singular surface contracting more than @xmath21 branches through @xmath0 ( corollary [ bound_nq ] ) .",
    "this fact implies a second bound @xmath22 which is sharper than ( [ intro_aux ] ) .",
