    "it was recently realized that , because the valence and sea quark mass dependence of the pqchpt lagrangian is explicit and because full qcd is within the parameter space of pqqcd ( @xmath24 ) , the values obtained for the gl coefficients in a pqqcd calculation are the exact values for the coefficients in full qcd @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the independent variation of valence and sea quark masses allows additional lever arms in the determination the these coefficients . because the @xmath12 dependence of the lagrangian is not explicit , the gl coefficients are functions of @xmath12 .",

    ". however , our use of staggered fermions on rather coarse lattices is likely to generate significant flavor symmetry breaking , and thus a splitting of the light meson masses .",
    "although there is no simple quantitative method to account for this split , one effect might be a reduction in the importance of meson loops , and thus a weakening of the chiral log terms . in order to study the systematic errors due to flavor symmetry breaking , we applied hypercubic blocking @xcite to our primary ensemble .    to determine the value of @xmath0",
