    "magnetic reconnection is generally believed to be the underlying mechanism that powers explosive events such as flares , substorms , and sawtooth crashes in fusion plasmas.@xcite traditionally , magnetic reconnection is grossly classified into two categories , i.e. collisional and collisionless reconnection , depending on whether ions and electrons remain coupled or not in the diffusion region .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that laminar collisional reconnection is described by the classical sweet - parker theory,@xcite which assumes an elongated current sheet characterized by a length @xmath7 of the order of the system size .",
    "the governing dimensionless parameter is the lundquist number @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the upstream alfvn speed , @xmath7 is the reconnection layer length , and @xmath10 is the resistivity . according to sweet - parker theory , the reconnection rate @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the upstream magnetic field . in many systems of interest ,",
    "the lundquist number @xmath0 is very high ( e.g. @xmath13 in solar corona ) , and the corresponding sweet - parker reconnection rate is too slow to account for energy release events .",
    "for this reason , research on fast reconnection in the past two decades has mostly focused on collisionless reconnection , which can yield reconnection rates as fast as @xmath14.@xcite    the sweet - parker theory assumes that the elongated current sheet is stable .",
    "however , it has long been known that this assumption may not hold , because the current sheet can become unstable to tearing instability and spontaneously form plasmoids at high-@xmath0.@xcite biskamp estimated the critical lundquist number @xmath15 to be approximately @xmath16.@xcite observational evidences of plasmoids have been reported in the earth s",

    "predicted that the linear growth rate @xmath17 scales as @xmath18 , and the number of plasmoids scales as @xmath19.@xcite at first sight , these results are rather counterintuitive , because linear growth rates of most resistive instabilities scale with @xmath0 to some negative fractional power indices instead of positive ones .",
    "the crucial point is to realize that the equilibrium , i.e. the sweet - parker current sheet , also scales with @xmath0 .",

    "the onset of the linear plasmoid instability would not be nearly as interesting were it not for the fact that it leads to a new nonlinear regime,@xcite entirely unanticipated by sweet - parker reconnection theory .",
    "furthermore , the plasmoid instability , which appears to be ubiquitous in high-@xmath0 plasmas , often leads inevitably to kinetic regimes in which the onset of fast reconnection occurs earlier than was previously thought possible.@xcite the picture emerging from these recent studies is that large - scale , high - lundquist - number magnetic reconnection can exhibit complex and rich dynamics that we are only beginning to understand .",

    "consider a harris sheet of width @xmath22 with the equilibrium magnetic field @xmath23 . according to the classical linear tearing instability theory ,",
    "the tearing mode growth rate for the constant-@xmath5 and non- constant-@xmath5 regimes are as follows , respectively:@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lundquist number based on the current sheet width @xmath22 .",
    "the transition from constant-@xmath5 to non - constant-@xmath5 modes occurs at @xmath26 , where the linear growth rate peaks and scales as @xmath27 .",
    "note that the linear growth rate is proportional to @xmath28 raised to a negative fractional exponent in both regimes . to apply the tearing mode theory to a sweet - parker current sheet ,",
    "it is important to note that the current sheet length @xmath7 is dictated by the global geometry , and remains approximately the same when @xmath10 varies . on the other hand ,",
    "the current sheet width @xmath29 follows the scaling @xmath20 , where the lundquist number @xmath30 is now defined with the current sheet length .",
    "the current sheet width @xmath22 in should now be replaced by @xmath29 , and @xmath28 is related to @xmath0 via the relation @xmath31 .",
    "after some algebra , the dispersion relation ( [ eq : tearing ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the peak growth rate occurs at @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "the number of plasmoids generated in the linear regime can be estimated as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the wavelength of the fastest growing mode .",
    "these scaling relations have been confirmed by numerical studies.@xcite the plasmoid instability is referred to as a super - alfvnic instability,@xcite because the linear growth rate far exceeds the inverse of the alfvn time scale @xmath39 along the current sheet in the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the growth rate is always slower than the inverse of the alfvn time scale @xmath40 transverse to the current sheet , as is required for the tearing mode analysis .",
    "the above analysis ( also the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ignores the effects of flow , which is self - consistently generated in a sweet - parker current sheet , on the instability .",
    "however , it is important to appreciate the convective nature of the instability . because the outflow speed is of the order of @xmath9 , disturbance in the current sheet",
    "will be convected out at the alfvn time scale @xmath41 .",
    "based on the scaling @xmath36 , the fastest growing mode will be amplified by a factor of @xmath42 before being convected out of the layer .",
    "if the initial disturbance is sufficiently small , it may not grow to a perceptible size , and the current sheet will appear to be stable .",
    "for this reason , we do not expect a clear - cut critical value of @xmath0 for the instability .",
    "simulations typically give a critical value @xmath43,@xcite although clean simulations that remain stable up to @xmath44 have been reported.@xcite there are also indications that the critical value @xmath15 may depend on plasma @xmath45.@xcite because the linear amplification factor increases rapidly as @xmath0 becomes large ( e.g. , @xmath46 at @xmath47 , respectively ) , the sweet - parker current sheet becomes very fragile at high @xmath0 , and plasmoid formation , which is the consequence of a true physical instability , is unavoidable .",
    "for instance , while noise levels significantly lower than @xmath48 of the background field may be sufficient to obtain a stable sweet - parker current sheet at @xmath49 , it requires a noise level significantly lower than @xmath50 to achieve a similar level of stability at @xmath51 .",
    "an even more stringent upper bound on the noise level is obtained at higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "we should point out that the linear amplification factor is introduced here to estimate the requirement on noise in order to keep the sweet - parker current sheet stable .",
    "it may not be representative of the real amplification , because the initial exponential growth is expected to slow down when nonlinear effects become important , which typically occurs once the the plasmoid size becomes comparable to the current sheet width.@xcite",
    "after onset of the plasmoid instability , the reconnection layer changes to a chain of plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets that , in turn , may become unstable again .",
    "this process of cascading to smaller scales is reminiscent of fractals.@xcite if the large - scale configuration evolves slowly , eventually the reconnection layer will tend to a statistical steady state characterized by a hierarchical structure of plasmoids ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fractal - like - cascade ] for snapshots of the cascade ) .",
    "two - dimensional numerical simulations show that reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of @xmath0 in this regime , with a value @xmath52.@xcite the number of plasmoids @xmath53 , the widths @xmath54 and lengths @xmath55 of secondary current sheets follow scaling relations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58.@xcite these scaling relations may be understood by assuming that all secondary current sheets are close to marginal stability . the rationale behind the assumption is as follows .",
    "firstly , we note that cascade to smaller scales will stop if the local lundquist number @xmath59 of a secondary current sheet is smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , secondary current sheets typically get stretched and become longer over time due to gradient in the outflow , which on average increases from zero near the center to @xmath60 near the ends of the reconnection layer .",
    "thirdly , when the current sheet length @xmath55 becomes sufficiently long such that @xmath61 , the current sheet becomes unstable , new plasmoids are generated , and the fragmented current sheets become short again .",
    "consequently , we expect the local lundquist number @xmath59 to stay close to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding current sheet width @xmath63 , and the number of plasmoids is estimated as @xmath64 .",
    "finally , reconnection rate can be estimated by @xmath65 , which is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "these scaling relations are consistent with the simulation results .",
    "statistical descriptions of plasmoids have drawn considerable interest in recent years , @xcite partly due to the possible link between plasmoids and energetic particles.@xcite the fractal - like fragmentation of current sheets suggests self - similarity across different scales,@xcite which often gives rise to power laws.@xcite a recent heuristic argument by uzdensky _",

    "@xcite ) and obtaining steady - state solutions of the plasmoid distribution.@xcite    the governing kinetic equation for the time evolution of @xmath4 is written as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the cumulative distribution function , i.e. the number of plasmoids with fluxes larger than @xmath5 .",
    "several idealized assumptions have been made in writing eq .",

    "firstly , the flux of a plasmoid grows due to reconnection in adjacent secondary current sheets .",
    "following the assumption that all secondary current sheets are close to marginal stability , the flux of a plasmoid grows approximately at a constant rate @xmath69 .",
    "this gives the plasmoid growth term @xmath70 on the left hand side .",
    "secondly , new plasmoids are created when a secondary current sheet becomes longer than the critical length for marginal stability .",
    "we assume that when new plasmoids are created , they contain zero flux ; this is represented by the source term @xmath71 ) , where @xmath72 is the dirac @xmath54-function , and @xmath73 is the magnitude of the source .",
    "this source term sets the boundary condition for @xmath4 at @xmath74 .",
    "thirdly , plasmoids disappear due to coalescence with larger plasmoids , which is assumed to be instantaneous . assuming the characteristic relative velocity between plasmoids is of the order of @xmath9 , the time scale of a plasmoid with flux @xmath5 to encounter a larger plasmoid is estimated as @xmath75 .",
    "this gives the coalescence loss term @xmath76 .",
    "note that when two plasmoids coalesce , the flux of the merged plasmoid is equal to the larger of the two original fluxes.@xcite therefore , coalescence does not affect the value of @xmath77 at the larger of the two fluxes .",
    "lastly , plasmoids are advected out from the reconnection layer with speeds @xmath60 on a characteristic time scale @xmath41 .",
    "this is represented by the advection loss term @xmath78 .",
    "exact steady - state solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : governing_eq ] ) can be found analytically.@xcite however , for the discussion here it is instructive to consider approximate solutions in different regimes . at large @xmath5",
    "when @xmath79 , the steady - state equation reduces to @xmath80 . in this regime @xmath81",

    ", the steady state solution admits both an exponential tail and a @xmath86 power - law regime . the dominant loss mechanism in the former regime is advection , while it is coalescence in the latter . in other words ,",
    "the plasmoids in the power - law regime must be deep in the hierarchy , whereas large plasmoids follow a distribution that falls off exponentially .",

    "therefore , the power law holds in the range @xmath95 , which becomes more extended for higher @xmath0 .",
    "this prediction of @xmath66 power - law distribution can be tested with numerical simulations .",

    "( [ eq : governing_eq ] ) leading to the @xmath66 solution is between the plasmoid growth term and the coalescence loss term , i.e. @xmath83 . a key assumption underlying the loss term @xmath76 is that the relative speeds of a plasmoid with respect to neighboring plasmoids larger than itself are of the order of @xmath9 and are uncorrelated to the flux of the plasmoid .",
    "however , that was found not to be the case when we examined the numerical data . instead",
    ", the relative speeds between large plasmoids tend to be lower.@xcite figure [ fig : stack ] shows the stack plot of plasmoid positions along the outflow direction @xmath107 over a period of @xmath108 , where each dot represents a plasmoid , color coded according to its flux in logarithmic scale .",
    "the stack plot has a tree - like structure , with branches that represent the trajectories of larger plasmoids shown on the red side of color scale . those dots ( or `` leaves '' ) on the blue side of the color scale are mostly smaller plasmoids that do not show perceivable trajectories .",
    "we can clearly see that many branches are nearly parallel to their neighboring branches , indicating low relative speeds between large neighboring plasmoids .",
    "this interesting phenomenon may be understood as follows .",
    "roughly speaking , the flux of a plasmoid is proportional to its age because all plasmoids approximately grow at the same rate @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , a plasmoid can become large only if it has not encountered plasmoids larger than itself for an extended period of time .",
    "those plasmoids moving rapidly relative to their neighbors will encounter larger plasmoids and disappear easily , whereas those with small relative speeds are more likely to survive for a long time and become large . to incorporate this important effect",

    "let @xmath110 be the new distribution function , where @xmath111 is interpreted as the plasmoid velocity relative to the mean flow .",
    "we propose the following kinetic model for @xmath110 : @xmath112 where the function @xmath113 is defined as @xmath114 and @xmath115 is an arbitrary distribution function in velocity space when new plasmoids are generated .",

    "[ fig : partial - merge ] ]    we caution the reader that although the heuristic argument in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] and the kinetic model in this section appear to account for the numerically observed scaling laws and plasmoid distributions , they are far from complete and satisfactory descriptions of the complex dynamics of a plasmoid - dominated reconnection layer .",
    "in particularly , a key building block of the present theory is the assumption that plasmoids are connected by marginally stable current sheets .",
    "that is clearly an oversimplification and does not appear to be always ( and quite often not ) the case upon close examination of simulation data;@xcite therefore , further exploration is warranted.@xcite some other potentially important effects are also omitted .",
    "for instance , plasmoids are treated as point `` particles '' and coalescence between them is assumed to occur instantaneously , whereas in reality larger plasmoids take longer to merge , and there can be bouncing ( or sloshing ) between them.@xcite furthermore , the velocity @xmath111 relative to the mean flow is assumed to remain constant throughout the lifetime of a plasmoid , whereas in reality some variation is expected due to the complex dynamics between plasmoids .    the fact that plasmoids can be in a partially merged state can have significant effects on the statistical distribution,@xcite and this issue is further complicated by that there are different ways of identifying the extent of a plasmoid among researchers . in our diagnostics , plasmoids are extrema ( o - points ) of the flux function , which we solve as a primary variable in the simulation code .",
    "the extent of a plasmoid is determined by expanding the level set of the flux function from the extremum until it reaches a saddle point ( x - point ) .",
    "note that our convention differs from that adopted by fermo _",
    "et al_. ( see figure 3 of ref .",
    "our method treats all plasmoids on equal footing , whereas that of fermo _",
    "et al_. makes a distinction between the dominant and the lesser plasmoids for partially merged plasmoids .",
    "although our method is mathematically unambiguous , it has a consequence that when two plasmoids are in the process of merging , both shrink in size until the merging is completed and a large plasmoid appears suddenly ( figure [ fig : partial - merge ] ) , whereas in the convention of fermo _ et al . _",
    "the lesser plasmoid shrinks in size and the dominant one keeps growing .",
    "this is a subtle point that merits further consideration if we apply the plasmoid distribution functions to the problem of particle energization .",
    "thus far , our discussion assumes that resistive mhd remains valid down to the smallest scales .",
    "this assumption is clearly questionable when current sheet widths reach kinetic scales , when two - fluid ( hall ) and kinetic effects become important .",
    "conventional wisdom had it that the onset of fast reconnection occurs when the sweet - parker width @xmath29 is smaller than the ion inertial length @xmath117 ( which should be replaced by the ion larmor radius at the sound speed , @xmath118 , if there is a strong guide field).@xcite because secondary current sheets can be much thinner than the sweet - parker width , the implication is that collisionless reconnection may set in even when the conventional criterion for onset is not met .",
    "this has been confirmed by several recent studies using fully kinetic @xcite and hall mhd @xcite models . along with these studies ,",
    "a practice has emerged of using phase diagrams to describe various possible `` phases '' of reconnection in the parameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath119.@xcite figure [ fig : phase - diagram ] shows our current rendition of the phase diagram , which is divided into seven regimes ( including two history - dependent regimes ) , and five `` phases '' , that will be detailed as follows .",

    "nonetheless , they can serve as a good frame of reference to explore large scale magnetic reconnection , either in choosing simulation parameters @xcite or in planning for future experiments.@xcite one should bear in mind that the border lines between different phases are not ironclad , because there is no clear - cut value of @xmath15 . furthermore , secondary current sheet widths can deviate from the estimated value @xmath133 . finally ,",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath54 can be affected by hall effects.@xcite more caveats in applying the phase diagrams are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a compilation of parameters for various astrophysical , space , and laboratory plasmas can be found in ref",
    "although significant advances have been made in recent years on large scale , high - lundquist - number reconnection , where plasmoids play important roles , many questions remain open .",
    "the results presented here are based on 2d studies .",
    "to what extent do these 2d results carry over to 3d geometry , where oblique tearing modes have been shown to play an important role?@xcite the relationship between plasmoid - dominated reconnection and turbulent reconnection@xcite is another issue that needs further investigation .",
    "what are their similarities and differences ?",
    "will the interaction between overlapping oblique modes in 3d lead to self - generated turbulence and further blur the line between the two ?",
    "how do global conditions affect the plasmoid instability and magnetic reconnection in general also needs further assessment .",
    "one of the most important results from recent 2d studies is that reconnection rate can not be significantly slower than @xmath139 , therefore is always fast ( although this has only been tested up to @xmath140 ) .",
    "this conclusion poses new challenges to theories of solar flares that assume the existence of slow reconnection.@xcite however , these studies were done in simple 2d configurations , and it is not clear whether the results can be directly applied to solar corona , where the line - tying effect is thought to play an important role.@xcite line - tying is known to have stabilizing effect on tearing instability @xcite and smoothing effect on current sheets.@xcite both effects could significantly affect the plasmoid instability . although line - tying has been employed in the lower boundary of some recent 2d simulations of the plasmoid instability in coronal current sheets , @xcite these studies are limited to anti - parallel reconnection , where line - tying stabilization is not effective .",
    "line - tying stabilization of the tearing instability is more effective for component reconnection , with the guide field line - tied to the boundary .",
    "therefore , to study the effects of line - tying on the plasmoid instability , 3d simulations will be needed .    even in 2d systems ,",
    "the current understanding is far from complete .",
    "the parameter space needs to be systematically explored with higher lundquist number and larger system size than that have been achieved , to test the proposed phase diagrams .",
    "the kinetic model of plasmoid distribution can be further improved by including other coarse - graining variables in addition to @xmath5 and @xmath111 , and the distribution of plasmoids in collisionless regime needs to be further studied .",

    "<S> our understanding of magnetic reconnection in resistive magnetohydrodynamics has gone through a fundamental change in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional wisdom is that magnetic reconnection mediated by resistivity is slow in laminar high lundquist ( @xmath0 ) plasmas , constrained by the scaling of the reconnection rate predicted by sweet - parker theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent studies have shown that when @xmath0 exceeds a critical value @xmath1 , the sweet - parker current sheet is unstable to a super - alfvnic plasmoid instability , with a linear growth rate that scales as @xmath2 . in the fully developed statistical steady state of two - dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the normalized average reconnection rate is approximately @xmath3 , nearly independent of @xmath0 , and the distribution function @xmath4 of plasmoid magnetic flux @xmath5 follows a power law @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> when hall effects are included , the plasmoid instability may trigger onset of hall reconnection even when the conventional criterion for onset is not satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the rich variety of possible reconnection dynamics is organized in the framework of a phase diagram . </S>"
