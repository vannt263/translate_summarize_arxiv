    "although string / m - theory is still developing , and the details of its connection to the standard model are still unclear , numerous ideas from string / m - theory have affected the phenomenology of particle physics .",
    "the latest of these ideas is non - commutative quantum field theory ( ncqft ) @xcite .",
    "ncqft arises through the quantization of strings by describing low energy excitations of d - branes in background em fields .",
    "ncqft generalizes our notion of space - time , replacing the usual , commuting , space - time coordinates with non - commuting space - time operators .",
    "this is similar to the replacement of the commuting position and momentum coordinates of classical physics with the non - commuting position and momentum operators of quantum mechanics .",
    "significant , testable differences exist between qft with commuting space - time coordinates and ncqft .",
    "this article is an attempt to probe those changes .    at this time",
    ", the details of a general ncqft model to compare to the standard model are just emerging @xcite .",
    "however , a non - commuting replacement of quantum electrodynamics , ncqed , does exist and can be studied .",
    "ncqed modifies qed , with the addition of a non - lorentz invariant , momentum dependent phase factor to the normal @xmath7 vertex , along with the addition of cubic ( @xmath8 ) and quartic ( @xmath9 ) coupling , also , with non - lorentz invariant momentum dependent phase factors .",
    "the feynman rules for ncqed are given in @xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "although the momentum dependent phase factors and higher dimensional operators in the lagrangian ( leading to additional couplings ) arise naturally in ncqft , the modifications , although similar , will in general , take on a different form than those presented here for ncqed .",
    "we will see that the modifications of ncqft to qed can be probed in @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions .",
    "the essential idea of ncqft is that in the non - commuting space time the conventional coordinates are represented by operators which no longer commute : @xmath12 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu } \\equiv { i\\over   { \\lambda_{nc}^2 } } c_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] here we adopt the hewett - petriello - rizzo parametrization @xcite where the overall scale , @xmath6 , characterizes the threshold where non - commutative ( nc ) effects become relevant and @xmath13 is a real antisymmetric matrix whose dimensionless elements are presumably of order unity .",
    "one might expect the scale @xmath6 to be of order the planck scale .",
    "however , given the possibility of large extra dimensions @xcite where gravity becomes strong at scales of order a tev , it is possible that nc effects could set in at a tev .",
    "we therefore consider the possibility that @xmath6 may lie not too far above the tev scale .",
    "the @xmath14 matrix is not a tensor since its elements are identical in all reference frames resulting in the violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "the @xmath13 matrix is related to the maxwell field strength tensor @xmath15 since ncqft arises from string theory in the presence of background electromagnetic fields .",
    "hence , @xmath14 can be parameterized , following the notation of @xcite , as @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the @xmath18 are related to space - time nc and are defined by the direction of the background * e*-field .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath18 can be parameterized as @xmath19 @xmath20 defines the origin of the @xmath21 axis which we set to @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the angle of the background * e*-field relative to the @xmath24-axis . likewise , the @xmath25 are related to the space - space non - commutativeness and are defined by the direction of the background * b*-field",
    ". they can be parameterized as @xmath26    ncqft can be cast in the form of conventional commuting qft through the application of weyl - moyal correspondance @xcite .",
    "the details of this derivation is given by ref .",
    "the net result is that the qed vertices pick up phase factors dependent on the momenta flowing through them and three and four point photon vertices are now present .",
    "these ncqed modifications are what is being tested in collider tests of ncqed .",
    "in addition , covariant derivatives can only be constructed for ( fermion ) fields of charge @xmath27 so we restrict our analysis to processes involving only charged leptons .",
    "the feynman rules for ncqed are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ncqed is beginning to attract theoretical and phenomenological interest @xcite .",
    "hewett , petriello and rizzo  @xcite have performed a series of phenomenological studies of ncqed at high energy , linear , @xmath2 colliders .",
    "they analyzed diphoton production ( @xmath28 ) , bhabha scattering ( @xmath29 ) and moller scattering ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "there are striking differences between qed and ncqed for all three processes ; most interesting is significant structure in the @xmath21 angular distribution .",
    "mathews @xcite and baek , ghosh , he and hwang  @xcite have also studied ncqed at high energy @xmath2 linear colliders . in",
    "the former case mathews studied high energy compton scattering while baek _",
    "et al . , _ studied fermion pair production in @xmath31 . in both cases the initial state photons are due to backscattering of laser photons off the electron and positron beams . as is well known , this produces a high luminosity , high energy photon beam , effectively converting an @xmath2 collider to an @xmath32 or @xmath3 collider @xcite . independently of the aforementioned studies we studied compton scattering and lepton pair production . in our study",
    "we studied the angular distributions , in contrast to the work of mathews @xcite and baek _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite whose analysis is based on the total cross section and which do not use the additional information inherent in the angular distributions .",
    "we find that the analysis based on angular distributions leads to exclusion limits on the ncqed scale of order 100  gev or more greater than those obtained by simply measuring the total cross section .",
    "in addition we also studied the effect on sensitivity of including systematic errors in addition to statistical errors .",
    "there are a number of other differences between our work and that of these authors . in the first case",
    ", mathews seems to have calculated the nc phase appearing in the cross section in the @xmath4 center of mass .",
    "this is an inherently lorentz violating quantity and we believe that it should be to calculated in the lab frame .",
    "we therefore disagree with his approach . in the case of the work of baek _",
    "_ we decided on different kinematic cuts which we feel to be more realistic . ultimately , the best approach will be decided by experimentalists , based on detailed detector simulations . to this end , it may be of some use to see the tradeoffs inherent in different approaches",
    ".    in the following sections we will examine the effects of ncqed in @xmath33 and compton scattering , @xmath11 . in the case of compton scattering ncqed leads to an oscillatory azimuthal dependence due to the preferred direction in the laboratory frame defined by the @xmath14 matrix .",
    "as will be discussed in detail later , we find that the compton scattering process yields significantly higher exclusion limits than the pair production process , despite lower statistics .    before proceeding we reiterate that the @xmath34 matrix is not lorentz invariant and the vectors @xmath35 and @xmath25 point in specific directions which are the same in all reference frames . in our analysis",
    "we define the @xmath24-axis to correspond to the direction of the incoming particles in the lab frame .",
    "if the experiment were to be repeated at a different location , the co - ordinates will be in general be different .",
    "in fact , as the earth rotates and revolves around the sun , the co - ordinate system also rotates .",
    "hence , it is important that the local co - ordinates be converted to a common frame such as a slowly varying astronomical co - ordinate system so that all measurements are made with respect to a common frame .",
    "more germaine to our specific examples is that one must calculate the cross sections in the lab frame not the centre of mass frame of either the initial @xmath36 or @xmath4 beams since each event will have a different momentum fraction of the initial electron beams and hence different boosts between the lab and center of mass frames .",
    "we begin by discussing the common points of our two analyses .",
    "we will present details and results from the pair production and compton scattering prosesses in separate subsections below .    in both cases ,",
    "we consider linear @xmath2 colliders operating at @xmath37 and 0.8  tev appropriate to the tesla proposal , @xcite @xmath37 , 1.0 and 1.5  tev as advocated by the nlc proponents @xcite , and @xmath38 , 5.0 and 8.0  tev being considered in clic studies @xcite . in order to estimate event rates , we assume an integrated luminosity of @xmath39  fb@xmath40 for all cases . we impose acceptance cuts on the final state particles of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as noted above , we take @xmath22 . therefore , in the pair production case , where only space - time nc enters , only the parameter @xmath23 remains in addition to @xmath6 .",
    "we consider three specific cases , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and report limits on @xmath6 for each of these values . in the compton scattering case , both space - space and space - time nc enter , leaving the two parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath46 in addition to @xmath6 .",
    "we examine the two values @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and for each value of @xmath46 give exclusion limits for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in order to quantify the sensitivity to ncqed",
    ", we calculate the @xmath49 for the deviations between ncqed and the sm for a range of parameter values .",
    "we start by calculating statistical errors based on an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the statistical errors are gaussian , which given the large event rates , is certainly valid .",
    "we consider two possibilities for systematic errors . in the first case",
    "we do not include systematic errors while in the second case we obtain limits by combining a 2% systematic error combined in quadrature with the statistical errors ; @xmath50 .",
    "the 2% systematic error is a very conservative estimate of systematic errors , for example the tesla tdr calls for only a 1% systematic error .",
    "our exclusions limits including systematic errors should therefore be considered conservative estimates of those thought to be eventually achievable .",
    "next , we calculate total cross sections , and @xmath51 and @xmath21 angular distributions in both qed and ncqed .",
    "we bin the angular distributions into 20 bins in @xmath51 and @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we calculate the @xmath49 for the different observables , @xmath52 , using : @xmath53 where @xmath52 represents the observable under consideration and the sum is over the bins of the angular distributions .",

    ", figure 1 shows the feynman diagrams that contribute .",
    "note the presence of the novel s - channel contribution from the presence in ncqed of the @xmath55 self - coupling .",
    "the differential cross section for this process is given by : @xmath56 the first two terms in the expression are the standard qed contributions , while the last term is due to the feynman diagram with the cubic @xmath8 coupling . the phase factor , @xmath57 only appears in this new term . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the momentum of the electron and positron , respectively , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the momenta of the incoming photons .",

    "6 simplifies to @xmath72 the expression for the cross section is not lorentz invariant due to the presence of the phase factor .",
    "note that only space - time non - commutativity contributes and there is no @xmath21 dependence in this case . in the limit @xmath73 the angle goes to zero and",
    "the sm is recovered .",
    "given that we ve chosen @xmath22 , @xmath74 , and the phase factor is identically zero for @xmath75 .",
