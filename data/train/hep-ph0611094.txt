    "a general problem in theoretical baryon physics is to make a connection between resonances that are predicted by various quark models and experiment . a reasonable way to proceed",
    "is by identifying the poles of analytic functions that are able to describe simultaneously all experimental data in a multiplicity of existing channels with theoretically predicted resonant states .",
    "therefore , properly and uniquely extracting resonance parameters from experiment is a task of primary importance .",
    "we emphasize the problem of uniqueness .",
    "the work described here is motivated by the need to extract breit - wigner resonance parameters from multichannel partial - wave analyses ( pwas ) in a model - independent way .",
    "many pwas of similar experimental data produce similar partial waves , while the extracted breit - wigner resonance parameters are often quite different .",
    "this fact can easily be seen in the _ review of particle physics _",
    "@xcite by the particle data group ( pdg ) .",
    "each resonance in the _ review _ has been parametrized in two ways .",
    "first , there are breit - wigner parameters , i.e. the resonance mass @xmath2 , decay width @xmath3 , and branching ratios @xmath4 ( the ratio between the partial width into channel @xmath5 and the total width ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath1-matrix complex poles ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , as well as complex residues ( moduli @xmath8 , and phases @xmath9 ) are given in  @xcite .",
    "breit - wigner parameters obtained in various partial - wave analyses vary quite substantially , partly because details of those analyses are different ; i.e. the number and character of the included channels , different parameterization schemes , analyticity constraints for scattering amplitudes , the choice of background models , and the method of unitarization ( if at all ) of the @xmath10 matrix .",
    "however , it is also the case that the methods for extracting resonance parameters are different : argand - plot fits  @xcite , breit - wigner fits with background  @xcite , direct fits of analysis parameters  @xcite , or model specific schemes which extract @xmath1 matrix poles  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present a model - independent method for extracting breit - wigner parameters from any unitary multichannel analysis able to provide the full @xmath1 matrix , using the trace of the corresponding @xmath0 matrix .",
    "since all breit - wigner parameterizations are equivalent at the energy of the @xmath0-matrix pole , the parameters obtained using this method should be directly compared to those from quark models and lattice qcd . in order to connect the results of a model - independent @xmath0 matrix extraction with those of a model - dependent analysis , e.g. based on the @xmath1 matrix",
    ", we shall keep the relations defining multichannel @xmath1 and @xmath0 matrices as general as possible .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath1-matrix trace simplifies the formalism without loss of generality , and shows resonant behavior more prominently than any @xmath1 matrix element does . to illustrate this",
    ", we shall take the @xmath1 matrix from an earlier analysis  @xcite and recalculate the resonance parameters .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix trace happens to show resonant behavior at energies matching those of the @xmath0-matrix poles .",
    "the essence of any multichannel theory is the fact that the evolution of a system is no longer described by scalars , but by operators acting in an orthonormal wave - function space , and the transition probabilities for physical ( measurable ) processes are given by the matrix elements of their representation in the chosen basis .",
    "once this basis is specified , the evolution of the system is described by solving equations which are matrices in the multichannel space , rather than scalar equations .",
    "all equations given here are considered to be matrix relations , unless matrix indices are explicitly stated .",
    "the transition probability @xmath11 that a two - body system from initial channel @xmath12 ends up in the final two - body ( or quasi - two - body ) channel @xmath13 is given by the absolute square of the scattering @xmath14-matrix element , where @xmath15 designates all quantum numbers conserved in the scattering reaction , and @xmath5 and @xmath16 are channels . in the case of @xmath17 scattering",
    "we have conserved spin , parity , and almost conserved isospin ( charge symmetry is only slightly violated ) .",
    "conservation of probability is ensured if the @xmath10 matrix ( for simplicity , we drop @xmath15 henceforth ) is unitary . therefore , the @xmath10 matrix can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is some matrix hermitian in the channel indices .",
    "hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues and are diagonalized by unitary matrices .",
    "the @xmath19 matrix is related to a real , diagonal matrix @xmath20 by a unitary transformation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a unitary matrix . the @xmath10 matrix is evidently diagonalized by the same transformation , so @xmath23 .    the @xmath0 matrix  @xcite is defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the unit matrix . the @xmath0 matrix can , in the eigenstate basis , be written using the diagonal matrix @xmath20 as .",
    "the @xmath0 matrix is hermitian because @xmath10 is unitary , and symmetric because of time - reversal invariance , so @xmath0 is , in fact , a real matrix .",
    "thus , @xmath22 is a real orthogonal matrix that we henceforth designate as @xmath26 .",
    "every diagonal @xmath27 matrix can be spanned in the ortho - normal vector basis @xmath28 : @xmath29 so , in our case , we have @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32th diagonal element of @xmath33 , also known as the _ eigenphase shift _ , and @xmath34 is the number of channels .",
    "we define the coupling matrices @xmath35 to be @xmath36 and these matrices turn out to be ortho - normal projectors : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the kronecker @xmath19 symbol .",
    "the trace of a matrix is , by definition , a sum of its diagonal elements .",
    "a trace has two particularly important properties : i ) the trace of a product of matrices is invariant with respect to cyclic permutations , @xmath39\\,=\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\,[bca]$ ] ; and ii ) the trace is a distributive function with respect to scalars @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42=\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\,[a]+\\beta \\,\\mathrm{tr}\\,[b]$ ] .",
    "the orthogonal transformation in definition  ( [ eq : chidefinition ] ) conserves the trace of a matrix , so @xmath43 it follows that the matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be written as the sums @xmath44 where the connection between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices is given by the relation @xmath45",
    "elements of @xmath46 , as well as the @xmath47 , are functions of energy or a corresponding kinematical variable , and their description requires modeling of the energy dependence of numerous functions .",
    "we see resonances in scattering reactions as real poles of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the @xmath48th element of the diagonal matrix @xmath46 can be written as  @xcite @xmath49 where the selected pole term is parametrized in breit - wigner form , and it is singled out from other contributions , designated collectively as the background term at resonance @xmath50 .",
    "the breit - wigner mass ( @xmath51 ) and total width ( @xmath52 ) parameters are allowed to be functions of the center - of - mass total energy @xmath53 .",
    "the reported breit - wigner parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 evaluated at an energy equal to the corresponding resonance mass @xmath54 : @xmath58 where we have explicitly written @xmath51 and @xmath52 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tanbw ] ) as functions of energy @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices are given by the equations @xmath59 where the second term in each equation is the coupled - channel background contribution , and @xmath60 represents @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath53 equals the mass of the resonance , @xmath62 is manifestly equal to @xmath52 .",
    "although these relations are in general a sum over several resonances @xmath48 , here they are written for one resonance for simplicity .",
    "if there is a pole in the @xmath0 matrix at some energy @xmath54 , then the matrix element @xmath63 at that energy gives the coupling strength of the resonance with mass @xmath54 and total decay width @xmath55 from channel @xmath5 to channel @xmath16 .",
    "the diagonal element of the matrix @xmath64 is the branching ratio @xmath65 of a given resonance to the channel @xmath5 @xmath66",
    "the channel dependence of resonance parameters can be reduced significantly by using only diagonal elements of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 matrices . in practice , these matrices can be obtained either by unitary coupled - channel partial - wave analyses , or by using partial - wave @xmath1 matrices obtained in diverse single - channel pwas as input to a unitary coupled - channel formalism , and refitting them to obtain a unitary set of all coupled - channel @xmath1 matrix elements .    channel dependence is completely removed from the sums @xmath67 because the traces of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices are the same as the traces of their similar diagonal partners @xmath46 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the same is also evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : traceisone ] ) .",
    "consequently , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kmartin ] ) and  ( [ eq : tmartin ] ) are simplified by taking the traces @xmath69 the last relation , i.e.  the @xmath1-matrix trace , would be a good starting point for model - dependent extraction methods .",
    "however , instead of putting considerable effort into modeling the background and energy- and channel - dependent resonance parameters , we use the following procedure :    1 .   the parameter extraction procedure starts when a full @xmath1 matrix has been obtained from an energy - dependent partial - wave analysis of experimental data .",
    "2 .   contrary to the usual prescription , where eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmartin ] ) is used to obtain resonance parameters from the @xmath1 matrix in a model - dependent way , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : deftoverk ] ) to obtain the full @xmath0 matrix from the known @xmath1 matrix .",
    "poles of @xmath70 are found to obtain a set of resonance masses @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of resonances .",
    "4 .   multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktrace ] ) by @xmath73 and setting the energy @xmath53 to the value of the @xmath74th resonance mass @xmath75 , the corresponding resonance width is isolated : @xmath76.\\ ] ] all other contributions to the @xmath0 matrix trace , i.e. background , other resonances , and channel - couplings , are removed in this limiting process ( this relation turns out to be similar to eq.(16 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the various @xmath17 isospin channels ) .",
    "the branching ratio of a resonance to a given channel can be obtained in similar manner , but this time using the diagonal @xmath0-matrix element , @xmath77 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmartin ] ) and definition  ( [ eq : defbranchingratio ] ) @xmath78,\\ ] ] where , as before , all undesired contributions vanish . 6 .   steps ( iv ) and ( v ) are then repeated for all resonances found in ( iii ) .",
    "to illustrate the usefulness of our method , resonance parameters from a unitary , multi - resonance , coupled - channel analysis  @xcite have been extracted .",
    "the channels used in the analysis were @xmath17 , @xmath79 , and an effective two - body channel designated as @xmath80 . extracted parameters are given in table  [ tb : resonances ] .",
    "the proposed model gives resonance parameters very close to the values obtained by a complicated method of diagonalizing the matrix of the generalized breit - wigner function denominator , with minimal calculation .",
    ".resonance parameters extracted using the @xmath0-matrix procedure given in this paper are listed in bold face .",
    "the original @xmath1 matrix was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where the channels used were @xmath17 , @xmath79 , and an effective two - body channel @xmath81 .",
    "for comparison , breit - wigner resonance parameters from the original reference are shown below . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          +         we have also compared the @xmath0-matrix trace to that of the @xmath1 matrix .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s11-g17 ] that the breit - wigner resonance positions obtained by looking for the poles in @xmath82 ( indicated by gray vertical lines ) directly correspond to the positions of peaks in @xmath83 , and of zeros in @xmath84 .",
    "the peaks of the @xmath1-matrix elements corresponding to individual channels , however , show a certain deviation from that behavior .",
    "this suggests that fitting individual channels in order to obtain resonance parameters introduces an uncontrolled error , which is avoided if the trace of the @xmath1 matrix is used .",
    "unexpectedly , and contrary to previous findings , the resonance parameters produced by the @xmath0-matrix extraction method presented here , are in accordance with values obtained by the original analysis as well as with the @xmath1-matrix trace .",
    "the procedure involves no fitting , diagonalizing , nor modeling of the energy dependence of the resonance parameters and background .",
    "furthermore , a model - independent procedure can not be given with the @xmath1-matrix formalism , because background makes a substantial contribution to the @xmath1 matrix , even at an energy equal to the resonance mass , @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix background is removed at a complex energy equal to the @xmath1-matrix pole position .",
    "this might be the reason why extractions of @xmath1-matrix poles work much better than @xmath1-matrix extractions of breit - wigner parameters . by using the trace of the @xmath0 matrix",
    ", background has been completely removed from consideration at the resonance energies .    with regard to the differences between the two approaches listed in table  [ tb : resonances ]",
    ", it is rather striking that all of them can be explained by arguments presented in the original analysis . since an effective @xmath80 channel was introduced in  @xcite to parametrize the first inelasticity in each partial wave",
    ", the parameters of low - lying resonances should be much better determined than those of heavier ones ( especially the third resonances in @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) .",
    "a better quality of parameters is also expected for resonances that couple more strongly to the measured channels considered here .",
    "therefore , @xmath34(1720 ) @xmath87 and the resonance(s ) in @xmath88 have unrealistic parameters since they are completely driven by the effective channel , as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : s11-g17 ] .",
    "these problems should be removed by the explicit inclusion of additional channels in the partial - wave analysis .",
    "the parameters of the two lowest resonances in the @xmath85 and @xmath86 partial waves , as well as those of the @xmath89 , second @xmath90 , and @xmath91 resonances , are in rough accordance with quark - model expectations for their masses and partial widths  @xcite , with the exception of the mass of the second @xmath86 , which is predicted to be roughly degenerate with the second @xmath85 and the @xmath89 resonance .",
    "this disagreement could be explained by the large coupling of this state to the effective channel .",
    "the large width and the somewhat larger mass of the first @xmath90 ( roper ) resonance extracted using the @xmath0-matrix procedure bring these parameters closer to those of the class of quark - model calculations based on one - gluon exchange potentials and pair creation for strong decays .",
    "we have presented a model - independent method for resonance parameter extraction using the @xmath0-matrix formalism . it is shown that real poles of the @xmath0 matrix are related to the resonant behavior of the trace of the @xmath1 matrix .",
    "our resonance parameter extraction procedure is simple and straightforward once the full @xmath1 matrix is known .",
    "unrealistic extracted parameters for some higher mass resonances point to the need to include additional channels in partial - wave analyses .    at the energies of the @xmath0-matrix poles ,",
    "the influence of background and channel mixing is eliminated , so only parameter values obtained at this particular energy should be compared directly to the predictions of quark model and lattice qcd calculations .    this model - independent procedure can not be extended to the @xmath1-matrix formalism because background makes a substantial contribution to the @xmath1 matrix , even at the resonance energies @xmath2 .",
    "this might be the reason why methods that extract @xmath1-matrix poles work much better than those which extract breit - wigner parameters from the @xmath1 matrix . by using the trace of the @xmath0 matrix",
