    "the theory of spin glasses in finite dimensional systems has traditionally been approached by the loop expansion around parisi s mean - field replica symmetry breaking solution @xcite . however , the picture of spin glasses which emerges from this perturbative approach is quite different to the one arising in droplet theory @xcite .",
    "the motivation for the present paper was to investigate the possibility that perturbation theory in spin glasses might fail for some reason ( for example , non - perturbative terms like `` droplets '' might dominate their free energy , at least in the low - temperature phase ) .",
    "we have started the programme with a study of the nature of the perturbation expansion in the high - temperature or paramagnetic phase , and postpone to another paper the discussion of the low - temperature phase",
    ".    in general the nature of perturbation expansions in disordered system is far from trivial .",
    "this is in contrast to the perturbation theory in pure systems , where , for example , the borel summability of the series leads to an accurate evaluation of critical exponents @xcite . in the study of the perturbation expansion for disordered ferromagnets , bray et al .",
    "@xcite found that even in zero dimensions , the high - order behavior of the perturbation expansion was surprisingly rich .",
    "the high - order expansion coefficients are sums of two kinds of terms : one type has an unusual cosine - like oscillation with increasing periodicity and the second type has a simple alternation in sign which dominates for small disorder .",
    "this unusual behavior has been further studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , with the final conclusion that the series is still summable , but that the simple borel procedure needs to be modified to deal successfully with long series .",
    "we shall find that the perturbation expansion for spin glasses has remarkably similar features to those of the disordered ferromagnet .",
    "our investigation of the nature of the perturbation expansions in the high - temperature phase of spin glasses starts by looking at the perturbation expansion of the zero - dimensional spin glass problem ( which will be referred to as the `` toy '' problem ) .",
    "the zero - dimensional field theory is the key to the analysis of the @xmath0-dimensional field theory as the extension to the @xmath0-dimensional field theory and critical exponents is a relatively straightforward extension of the toy problem @xcite .",
    "apart from being simple integrals , the zero - dimensional toy field theory has the advantage of allowing an analysis without replicas . in this paper",
    "this is achieved by mapping the problem to that of critical finite - size scaling in a modified version of the spherical spin glass @xcite and this mapping allowed us to find the high - order behavior without the use of replicas .",
    "however , to obtain the high - order behavior of the perturbation expansion for the @xmath0-dimensional field theory requires the use of replicas and we found that this needed the use of a non - trivial replica symmetry breaking scheme in the toy model in order to get results consistent with our mapping to the spherical model .",
    "our chief result is that the perturbation theory is well - defined and the dominant high - order terms in the perturbation expansion have coefficients of alternating signs .",
    "however , the perturbation series of the zero - dimensional spin glass field theory is not borel summable in a straightforward way due to the presence of subdominant terms .",

    "the quartic terms work as stabilizing terms , but for @xmath10 are irrelevant variables which we shall drop .",
