    "along with black holes , wormholes are intriguing objects in general relativity which have been attracting people even not working in gravitational physics .",

    "it is known that an exotic matter violating the null energy condition is necessary for static traversable wormholes in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "this is also a natural consequence of the topological censorship in the asymptotically flat case  @xcite .",
    "thus , to construct wormhole solutions with small or even without violation of the energy condition has been a big challenge in wormhole physics  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the wormhole spacetime can be constructed with an arbitrarily small amount of matter which violates the averaged null energy condition  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the wormhole configuration could be realized in the universe by some quantum effects violating the energy conditions .",
    "then , a natural question is the stability of the wormhole solutions .",
    "a wormhole could be formed from the gravitational collapse of matter fields possibly violating the energy conditions .",
    "also , it may be formed by some quantum tunneling effect .",
    "the stability analysis is important in order to clarify the stable stationary configuration of a wormhole . in the case of the static wormhole solution with thin shells , there exist linearly stable configurations depending on the parameter(s ) of the solution  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no stable and analytic wormhole solutions have been reported in the studies of mode analyses and numerical simulations so far  @xcite .",
    "independent of the stability of the stationary wormhole configurations , the formation of a wormhole is a highly nontrivial problem because it is a dynamical process of the topology change .",
    "actually , the dynamical aspects of wormholes have not been well understood so far .",
    "although there is a lot of static wormhole solutions obtained in the literature , there are few works on the exact model of wormhole formation from the regular initial data . because the formation or the growth of a wormhole is essentially a quite complicated dynamical and inhomogeneous process , numerical methods have been often used to study such problems . in these surroundings ,",
