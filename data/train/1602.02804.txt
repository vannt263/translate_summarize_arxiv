    "the gas pressure impedes the gas from moving with its dm hosts and leaves the gas to be around the mass center of the entire system .",
    "the gas contributes an additional gravitational force from the center , which drags the runaway dm particles to fall back more quickly and makes them experience more dynamical friction at the relatively early stage .",
    "though the gas mass is only around one tenth of the total cluster mass , the distance between the gas mass center and the dm halo is approximately half of the distance between the dm haloes .",

    "as seen from figure  [ fig : timescale ] , the mergers in which the gas halos collide have much shorter merger timescales than those without gas halo collisions , which implies that the additional gravitational potential contributed by the gas left around the center of mass of the entire system after the pericentric passage plays the dominant role in the baryonic effect on the merger timescale .",

    "the merger timescale ratios obtained with @xmath53 are smaller than those with @xmath52 ( except for the mergers with large impact parameters , e.g. , @xmath54 ) , which suggests that the baryonic effect becomes more significant for those stronger collisions with high relative velocities .",
    "this dependence on @xmath11 can be understood as follows .",
    "the strength of the dynamical friction drops significantly when the separation between the two clusters gets larger , because the mass density is low at the cluster outskirts ( see eq .",

    "only mildly depends on the merger parameters @xmath56 and @xmath6 . for the high relative velocity mergers , the timescale ratio shows a slightly decreasing trend when @xmath57 .",
    "because the circular velocity of the cluster with mass @xmath58 at the virial radius is @xmath59 , the role of the baryons is more significant when @xmath53 , compared with that in the low - velocity mergers ( due to the similar argument in the above item ) .",

    "the significance of the baryonic effect on the merger timescale depends on the strength of the collision between the gas halos and decreases with increasing primary pericenter distances of the merger . for the low - velocity mergers , the primary pericenter distances are not sensitive to the impact parameter . for example , for the mergers with @xmath62 )",

    "this explains the almost independence of the timescale ratio on the impact parameter for the low - velocity mergers shown in figure  [ fig : ratio](b ) .",

    "the two clusters are approximated as two point masses ( or particles ) during the merger .",
    "the motion of each point mass is controlled by the following three types of forces : the gravitational attraction from the dm - halo of the other cluster ( @xmath71 ; excluding the gas component , if any ) ; the dynamical friction ( @xmath72 ) due to the motion of one cluster in the gravitational field of the other cluster ; and the additional gravitational force contributed by the baryons ( @xmath73 ) dragged around the mass center of the system after the primary pericentric passage . the total force acting on each of the two particles ( represented by the subscripts @xmath74 )",

    "[ eq : gravforce ] and [ eq : dynfriction ] ) . ] can not reproduce the dependence of the merger timescale on gas fractions shown in figure  [ fig : parameter ] .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dissipative baryonic material can play an important role in accelerating the merger processes of galaxy clusters in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "the baryonic effect is relatively more significant for high relative velocity mergers , compared with low relative velocity ones , as shown in figures  [ fig : parameter ] and [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "note that the pairwise velocity distribution of dm halos ( @xmath79 ) in cosmological simulations shows its peak at @xmath80 @xcite , and the fraction of the cluster mergers with high relative velocity @xmath81 can be up to @xmath82 .",
    "thus we expect that the baryonic effect is important in the formation and evolution of massive clusters .",

    "( 1 ) the halo finding algorithm used in simulations does not consider the dynamical state of halos , which may weaken the baryonic effect revealed in this paper . and ( 2 ) the box size of the simulations in @xcite , @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , and @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) may also limit the statistical precision at the high - mass end of the mass function .",

    "the survival time for the subclusters is suppressed by a factor of up to 3 in the mergers with @xmath39 , compared with the dm - only mergers ( see the example in figure  [ fig : timescale ] ) .",
    "the subhalo mass function of the galaxy clusters at the massive end ( @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the subhalo mass and the host halo mass , respectively ; see @xcite ) might be overestimated in the dm - only simulations .",
    "thus the abundance of the massive subhalos in galaxy clusters estimated from the simulations is expected to be closer to the expectations from the analytical model in @xcite ( see figs .  4 and 5 therein ) , after the baryonic effect is considered .",
    "note that the baryonic effect revealed in this paper is obtained under a simplified model of the galaxy cluster structure and an assumption of adiabatic gas dynamics .",
    "according to the results of the current cosmological simulations , the effects of some other non - gravitational processes ( e.g. , radiative cooling , energetic feedback ) implemented in the simulations @xcite could be significant on the gas fraction profile , but mild on the total gas fraction .",

( 1 ) the above baryonic effect ( i.e. , the dependence of the merger timescale on the gas fraction ) depends on the initial relative velocity ; and generally , the effect is more remarkable if the relative velocity is higher . as an example , the merger timescales for mergers with @xmath39 can be 23 times shorter than those dm - only mergers when @xmath90 .",

    "the acceleration of the particle @xmath74 contributed by this drag can be written as , |_gd = = -_gd**r**_ic , [ eq : gasdrag ] where @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the distance between the position of the particle @xmath74 and the center of the gas halo , and @xmath118 represents the gas mass within the radius @xmath119 .",
    "the gas density distribution @xmath120 is assumed to follow the hernquist model truncated at the radius @xmath121 , @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the scale density and scale radius , respectively .",
    "the distribution is normalized by the gas halo mass within @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a geometric factor as a function of the pericenter distance @xmath128 .",

    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows the schematic diagram for the definition of the geometric factor @xmath127 , which is the ratio of the shaded volume to the total volume of the two clusters .",
    "the factor is assumed to be the fraction of the gas mass impeded in the center of the merger system after the primary pericentric passage .",

    "the relaxation moment of the merger in the toy model is defined as the moment of the @xmath130th pericentric passage , if the time duration between the @xmath130th and the @xmath131th pericentric passages is smaller than @xmath132 of the time duration between the primary and the secondary pericentric passages .",
    "we find @xmath130 ranges between 36 in most of the models , roughly consistent with the results from the numerical simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : model ] shows the merger timescales obtained from both the toy model and the dm - only numerical simulations for mergers with different mass ratios and initial relative velocities .",
    "as seen from this figure , the merger timescales resulting from the toy model are well consistent with those obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "the gravity between the clusters and the dynamical friction ( i.e. , the first two terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : force ] ) could model the merger timescale well for the dm - only mergers without baryons , but not the dependence of the merger timescale on gas fractions for mergers with baryons .",
