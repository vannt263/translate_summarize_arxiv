    "a hidden markov model ( hmm ) is a bivariate stochastic process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a markov chain ( often referred to as the state sequence ) in a state space @xmath3 and , conditionally on @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a sequence of independent random variables in a state space @xmath6 such that the conditional distribution of @xmath7 given the state sequence depends on @xmath8 only .",
    "the key feature of hmm is that the state sequence @xmath2 is not observable , so that statistical inference has to be carried out by means of the observations @xmath5 only .",
    "such problems are far from straightforward due to the fact that the observation process @xmath5 is generally a dependent , non - markovian time series [ despite that the bivariate process @xmath9 is itself markovian ] .",
    "hmm appear in a large variety of scientific disciplines including financial econometrics @xcite , biology @xcite , speech recognition @xcite , neurophysiology @xcite , etc . , and the statistical inference for such models is therefore of significant practical importance @xcite .    in this paper , we will consider a parametrized family of hmm with parameter space @xmath10 .",
    "for each parameter @xmath11 , the dynamics of the hmm is specified by the transition kernel @xmath12 of the markov process @xmath13 , and by the conditional distribution @xmath14 of the observation @xmath7 given the signal @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the state and observation sequences may be generated according to a nonlinear dynamical system ( which defines implicitly @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ( nonlinear ) functions and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are independent sequences of i.i.d .",
    "random variables which are independent of @xmath20 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we fix a distinguished element @xmath21 .",
    "we will always presume that the kernel @xmath22 possesses a unique invariant probability measure @xmath23 , and we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the law and associated expectation of the stationary hmm with parameter @xmath26 ( we refer to section [ sec : canonical ] for detailed definitions of these quantities ) . in the setting of this paper , we have access to a single observation path of the process",
    "@xmath27 sampled from the distribution @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is interpreted as the _ true _",
    "parameter value , which is not known a priori .",
    "our basic problem is to form a consistent estimate of @xmath26 on the basis of the observations @xmath27 only , that is , without access to the hidden process @xmath28 .",
    "this will be accomplished by means of the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) is one of the backbones of statistics , and common wisdom has it that the mle should be , except in `` atypical '' cases , consistent in the sense that it converges to the true parameter value as the number of observations tends to infinity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that this is indeed the case for hmm under a rather minimal set of assumptions .",
    "our main result substantially generalizes previously known consistency results for hmm , and can be applied to many models of practical interest .",
    "the study of asymptotic properties of the mle in hmm was initiated in the seminal work of baum and petrie @xcite in the 1960s . in these papers , the state space @xmath3 and the observation space",
    "@xmath6 were both presumed to be finite sets .",
    "more than two decades later , leroux @xcite proved consistency for the case that @xmath3 is a finite set and @xmath6 is a general state space .",
    "the consistency of the mle in more general hmm has subsequently been investigated in a series of contributions @xcite using a variety of methods . however",
    ", all these results require very restrictive assumptions on the underlying model , such as uniform positivity of the transition densities , which are rarely satisfied in applications ( particularly in the case of a noncompact state space @xmath3 ) .",
    "a general consistency result for hmm has hitherto remained lacking .",
    "though the consistency results above differ in the details of their proofs , all proofs have a common thread which serves also as the starting point for this paper .",
    "let us therefore recall the basic approach for proving consistency of the mle .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the likelihood of the observations @xmath30 for the hmm with parameter @xmath11 and initial measure @xmath31 .",
    "the first step of the proof aims to establish that for any @xmath11 , there is a constant @xmath32 such that @xmath33 = h({{\\theta^\\star}},\\theta ) , \\qquad { \\bar{{\\mathbb{p}}}}_{{{\\theta^\\star}}}\\mbox{-a.s.}\\ ] ] for @xmath34 , this convergence follows from the generalized shannon ",
    "mcmillan theorem @xcite , but for @xmath35 the existence of the limit is far from obvious .",
    "now set @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath37 is the relative entropy rate between the observation laws of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the second step of the proof aims to establish identifiability , that is , that @xmath39 is minimized only at those parameters @xmath38 that are equivalent to @xmath26 ( in the sense that they give rise to the same stationary observation law ) .",
    "finally , the third step of the proof aims to prove that the maximizer of the likelihood @xmath40 converges @xmath24-a.s . to the maximizer of @xmath32 , that is , to the minimizer of @xmath39 .",
    "together , these three steps imply consistency .",
    "let us note that one could write the likelihood as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the conditional density of @xmath7 given @xmath43 under the parameter @xmath38 ( i.e. , the one - step predictor ) . if the limit of @xmath44 as @xmath45 can be shown to exist @xmath24-a.s .",
    ", existence of the relative entropy rate follows from the ergodic theorem and yields the explicit representation @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "such an approach was used in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the predictive distribution @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of a measure - valued markov chain ( the prediction filter ) , so that existence of the relative entropy rate , as well as an explicit representation for @xmath32 , follows from the ergodic theorem for markov chains if the prediction filter can be shown to be ergodic .",
    "this approach was used in @xcite . in @xcite , the existence of the relative entropy rate",
    "is established by means of kingman s subadditive ergodic theorem ( the same approach is used indirectly in @xcite , which invokes the furstenberg  kesten theory of random matrix products ) . after some additional work , an explicit representation of @xmath32 is again obtained .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , page 136 , the latter is surprisingly difficult , as kingman s ergodic theorem does not directly yield a representation of the limit as an expectation .    though the proofs use different techniques , all the results above rely heavily on the explicit representation of @xmath32 in order to establish identifiability .",
    "this has proven to be one of the main difficulties in developing consistency results for more general hmm .",
    "for example , an attempt in @xcite to generalize the approach of @xcite failed to establish such a representation , and therefore to establish consistency except in a special example . once identifiability has been established , standard techniques ( such as wald s method ) can be used to show convergence of the maximizer of the likelihood , completing the proof .    for completeness",
    ", we note that a recent attempt @xcite to prove consistency of the mle for general hmm contains very serious problems in the proof @xcite ( not addressed in @xcite ) , and therefore fails to establish the claimed results .      in this paper",
    ", we prove consistency of the mle for general hmm under rather mild assumptions .",
    "though our proof follows broadly the general approach described above , our approach differs from previous work in two key aspects .",
    "first , we note that it is not necessary to establish existence of the relative entropy rate . indeed , rather than attempting to prove the existence of a limiting contrast function @xmath47 which",
    "must then shown to be identifiable in the sense that @xmath48 for parameters @xmath38 not equivalent to @xmath26 , it suffices to show directly that @xmath49 [ note that the existence of @xmath50 is guaranteed by the shannon ",
    "breiman  mcmillan theorem , and therefore poses little difficulty in the proof ] .",
    "this simple observation implies that it suffices to obtain a convenient upper bound for @xmath51 , which we accomplish by introducing the assumption that some iterate @xmath52 of the transition kernel of the state sequence possesses a bounded density with respect to a @xmath53-finite reference measure @xmath54 .",
    "second , and perhaps more importantly , we avoid entirely the need to obtain an explicit representation for the limiting contrast function @xmath32 which played a key role in all previous work . instead",
    ", we develop in section [ sec : identifiability ] a surprisingly powerful information - theoretic device which may be used to prove identifiability in a very general setting ( see @xcite for related ideas ) , and is not specific to hmm .",
    "this technique yields the following : in order to establish that the normalized relative entropy is bounded away from zero , that is , @xmath55 > 0 , \\ ] ] it suffices to show that there is a sequence of sets @xmath56 such that @xmath57 [ here @xmath58 is the law of the hmm with parameter @xmath59 and initial measure @xmath60 , while @xmath61 denotes the likelihood of @xmath30 under @xmath24 ] .",
    "it is rather straightforward to find such a sequence of sets , provided the law of the observations @xmath63 is ergodic under @xmath24 and satisfies an elementary large deviations property under @xmath58 .",
    "these properties are readily established in a very general setting .",
    "in particular , we will show ( section [ sec : v - uniform - separation ] ) that any geometrically ergodic state sequence gives rise to the requisite large deviations property , so that our main result can be applied immediately to a large class of models of practical interest .",
    "( let us note , however , that ergodicity of @xmath58 is not necessary ; see section [ sec : finite - state - leroux ] . )",
    "of course , there are some complications . rather than investigating the likelihood",
    "function @xmath51 directly , the proof of our main result relies in an essential manner on the asymptotics of the process @xmath64 where @xmath54 is the reference measure defined above .",
    "the latter process plays a special role in our proofs due to the fact that it satisfies a certain submultiplicativity property ; this allows us to upper bound @xmath65 by a time average , which possesses an almost sure limit by birkhoff s ergodic theorem ( see the proof of theorem [ thm : consistency ] below for further details ) .",
    "as @xmath54 is typically only @xmath53-finite , however , it is not immediately obvious that the problem is well - posed .",
    "nonetheless , we will see that these complications can be resolved , provided that the hmm is sufficiently `` observable '' so that the improper likelihood @xmath64 is well defined for sufficiently large @xmath66 ( under mild integrability conditions ) .",
    "as is demonstrated by the examples in section [ sec : applications ] , this is the case in a wide variety of applications .",
    "finally , let us note that the techniques used in the proof of our main result appear to be quite general .",
    "though we have restricted our attention in this paper to the case of hmm , these techniques could form the foundation for consistency proofs in other dependent and non - markovian time series models ( such as , e.g. , the autoregressive setting of @xcite ) , which share many of the difficulties of statistical inference in hidden markov models .",
    "other asymptotic properties of the mle , such as asymptotic normality , merit further investigation .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : assumptionsmainresults ] , we first introduce the setting and notations that are used throughout the paper . then",
    ", we state our main assumptions and results . in section [ sec : applications ] , our main result is used to establish consistency in three general classes of models : linear - gaussian state space models , finite state models , and nonlinear state space models of the vector arch type ( this includes the stochastic volatility model and many other models of interest in time series analysis and financial econometrics ) .",
    "section [ sec : main - proof ] is devoted to the proof of our main result . finally , section  [ sec : v - uniform - separation ] is devoted to the proof of the fact that geometrically ergodic models satisfy the large deviations property needed for identifiability .",
    "in particular , we prove in section [ sec : exponential - inequality ] general azuma  hoeffding type concentration inequality for @xmath0-uniformly ergodic markov chains , which is of independent interest .",
    "we fix the following spaces throughout :    * @xmath3 is a polish space endowed with its borel @xmath53-field @xmath67 .",
