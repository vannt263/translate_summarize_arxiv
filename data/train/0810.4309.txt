    "although the mssm is the leading candidate for new physics beyond the standard model and sensible explains electroweak symmetry breaking by stabilizing the energy scale , it still leaves with no answer the open problems of the sm , among them the flavor problem @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , susy brings a new flavor problem which is closely related to the mass generation mechanism of the superpartners .",
    "namely , a generic sfermion mass could lead to unacceptable large fcnc , which would exclude the model@xcite .",
    "several conditions or scenarios have been proposed to solve this problem , which reduce the number of free parameters and safely fit the experimental restrictions .",
    "the solutions handle in the literature include@xcite : +    * _ i ) _ _ degeneration _ , where different sfermion families have the same mass ; * _ ii ) _ _ proportionality _ , here the trilinear @xmath0 are proportional to the yukawa couplings ( sugra)@xcite ; * _ iii ) _ _ decoupling _ , where the superpartners are too heavy to affect the low energy physics(split susy , focus point susy , inverted hierarchy)@xcite ; * _ iv ) _ _ alignment _ , in this case the same physics that explains the fermion mass spectra and mixing angles also would explain the pattern of sfermions mass spectra@xcite .",
    "+    in the mssm the particle mass spectra depends on the susy breaking mechanism .",
    "the parametrization of susy breaking for mssm is called _ soft susy breaking , ssusyb_. the scalar fields are grouped in a supermultiplet together with the fermions fields , in such a way that the scalar masses are linked to the ssusyb energy scale and the mass degeneracy could be broken by the ssusyb mechanism .",
    "+ in this paper we are going to study the slepton mass matrices .",
    "our goal is to determine the slepton mass eigenvalues , which are the ones that hopefully will be measured at coming ( lhc ) and future colliders ( ilc ) . for this",
    ", we shall propose a hierarchy within the mass matrices , which will include a sector that will have the property of being exactly diagonalizable .",
    "this sector will determine mostly the slepton masses .",
    "we also include a sector with small off - diagonal entries that will lead to lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) , but we leave this last analysis to future work . + the organization of this papers is as follows . in the next section we present the terms that contribute to the slepton mass matrix in the mssm .",
    "section 3 explicitly shows the ansatz proposed for the trilinear terms that contribute to this mass matrix as two contribution orders mentioned above , obtaining the expressions for the slepton masses .",
    "we present the numerical results for the parameter space in section 4 . and finally , in section 5 we summarize our conclusions . +",
    "the susy invariant terms , which contribute to the diagonal elements of the mass matrix , come from the auxiliary fields , namely the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , the mass matrix also includes terms that come from the soft susy lagrangian @xcite . within the mssm ,",
    "this soft lagrangian includes the following terms @xmath3    in order to establish the free parameters of the model coming from this lagrangian , we write down the form of the slepton masses and the higgs - slepton - slepton couplings , the first and last term of eq .",
    "( [ softlag ] ) , which are given as @xmath4    where the _ trilinear terms _ , or _ a - terms _ , are the coefficient of the scalar higgs - sfermions couplings .",
    "+ in principle , any scalar with the same quantum numbers could mix through the soft susy parameters@xcite .",
    "this general mixing includes the parity superpartners fermionic labels , and leads us to a sfermion mass matrix given as a squared @xmath5 matrix , which can be written as a block matrix as + @xmath6 where @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lepton mass matrix . +",
    "the lepton - flavor conservation is violated by the non - vanishing off - diagonal elements of each matrix , and the size of such elements is strongly constrained from experiments . in the susy standard model based on supergravity",
    ", it is assumed that the mass matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 are proportional to unit matrix , while @xmath11 is proportional to the yukawa matrix @xmath12 . with these soft terms ,",
    "the lepton - flavor number is conserved exactly@xcite . however , in general soft - breaking schemes , we expect that some degree of flavor violation would be generated .",
    "a particular proposal for this pattern is presented next .",
    "the trilinear terms come directly from the soft susy breaking terms , and contribute toward to increase the superparticles masses .",
    "we analyze the consequences on sfermion masses by assuming that such terms would acquire an specific flavor structure , which is represented by some _",
    "textures_. textures represent an _ a priori _ assumption@xcite,@xcite , in this case , for the mixtures between sfermion families .",
    "such a structure implies that we can classify the matrix elements into three groups , the ones that contribute at leading order , those that could generate appreciable corrections and those that could be discarded , obtaining a hierarchal textures form .",
    "+ we propose an ansatz for the trilinear a - terms in the flavor basis , and study its effects on the physical states .",
    "we work on a scheme that performs exact diagonalization .",
    "first , we parameterize off - diagonal terms assuming a favor asymmetry inherited from the fermionic sm sector . in general",
    ", there is no reason to expect that the sfermion mass states are exactly degenerate , and there is no solid theoretical basis to consider such pattern , although they are phenomenologically viable@xcite .",
    "+ we assume , as in supergravity models , the condition of degeneracy on pure left and pure right contributions : @xmath13    our ansatz for the @xmath0 is build up using textures forms and hierarchal structure as we pointed above .",
    "the parametrization is obtained by assuming that the mixing between third and second families is larger than the mixing with the first family .",
    "furthermore , current data mainly suppress the fcncs associated with the first two slepton families , but allow considerable mixing between the second and third slepton families@xcite .",
    "+ thus , our proposal includes dominant terms that mix the second and third families , as follows    @xmath14    then mixtures with the first family are treated as corrections , and are given as : + @xmath15 + in the case of @xmath16 we reproduce the ansatz given in ref .",
    "the dominant terms give a @xmath17 decoupled block mass matrix , in the basis @xmath18 as + @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 coupling of two different higgs superfield doublets , @xmath24 is the trilinear coupling scale and @xmath25 is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values coming from the two neutral higgs fields , these three are mssm parameters@xcite .",

    "then , in the next two figures we show the dependence of the slepton masses on the usual mssm parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath24 and @xmath45 .",
    "+ we see that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath48 , having a strong dependency on the sign of @xmath22 , and so we obtain a hierarchy of the slepton masses given as follows : @xmath49    we observed this on the graphs of figure [ fg : bwy ] , where we run independently the values of @xmath50 and @xmath44 in a range of @xmath51 $ ] and set the values for the soft susy breaking scale as @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .",
    "we have practically no dependence on parameter @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath54 we have degeneracy of the four lightest sleptons , and practicaly no dependency on these parameters for the heaviest two sleptons",
    ". the non - degeneracy increases up to @xmath55 with @xmath56 for the two middle sleptons smuons ( or staus ) .",
    "this result tells us that if we are to explore the mixtures on the second and third families we have to take into account the term coming from the smuon mass term , represented here whit paremeter @xmath44 , ( [ blo ] ) . as we said",
    "the strongest dependency comes from the mssm parameter , and the deviation from universality is manifested by the staus , which in the case of @xmath40 , show a difference in staus masses of @xmath57 .",
    "+    in figure [ fg : btanb ] we verify the behavior of slepton masses with @xmath45 , we run the ansatz parameter through the interval @xmath58 $ ] , and @xmath59 .",
    "we found that for @xmath40 the smuons are independent for @xmath60 , while for @xmath61 the staus are the ones independent , but for @xmath62 .",
    "+    although we have considered the all ssusyb parameters equal to the susy breaking mass scale @xmath63 , this is not necessary true .",
    "we explore independently the possible values for the higgsinos mass parameter @xmath22 from the soft mass term as is shown in top of figure [ fg : bmua0 ] . in the same sense",
    "we explore independently the @xmath64 coupling , the results are shown in the bottom of the same figure , [ fg : bmua0 ] . in both cases we set the soft mass term as @xmath52 .",
    "we observed again the difference in the mass hierarchy between smuons and staus depending on the @xmath22 sign . in the trilinear coupling dependency , we observe that the non - degeneration increases for @xmath65 . +",
    "we have study the possible non - degeneration for the sleptones massses , using an ansatz for the slepton mass matrix . specifically , consider the mixing to occur between the second and third families , and assume that this mixing comes solely from left - right terms .",
    "we encounter the parameter space dependency of the masses , including both the mssm parameters and the proposed model parameters .",
    "this non - degeneracy could be measured in the cases where it is about @xmath66 of the susy soft - breaking mass scale @xmath67 , this percentage is suggested by considering the experimental uncertainty .",
    "+ we observed that the strongest dependence comes from the mssm parameter space .",
    "while , as we expected , the parameters of the ansatz act only to accomplish for some non - zero terms . + a dependence on @xmath22 sign is strongly manifested .",
    "the mass hierarchy changes whether @xmath22 is positive or negative , this lead us to the conclusion that if the hierarchy mass spectrum most expected , _",
    "@xmath68 then @xmath22 must be negative .",
    "also we observed that for each case ,    * for _ @xmath69 _ , we obtain non - degeneration on staus , with a difference between them of 10% or more , for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "and we have practically smuons degeneration . in this case , considering @xmath72 , generates a difference in stau masses of @xmath73 of @xmath67 , with @xmath74 while for the smuons we reach only @xmath75 .",
    "for the ansatz parameters we also have an increase in mass difference up to @xmath76 for @xmath77 * for _ @xmath78 _ , the non - degeneration is obtained for the smuons , and the difference between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , could be larger than 10% for @xmath70 and @xmath81 , while we obtain approximately stau degeneration , where only for @xmath82 , we reach a difference of @xmath83 of the @xmath67 . + analyzing the ansatz parameters , we obtain an increased mass difference for @xmath77 getting up to @xmath76 , with the strongest dependency being on the @xmath44 parameter .",
    "+    for @xmath45 we conclude that if a degenerated masses are measured then @xmath45 value should be at around @xmath84 , while in the other case , no - degeneration is manifested either at small @xmath85 , ( less than @xmath86 ) or for large value .",
