    "interchain , interplane transport of electrons in low dimensional ( quasi 1d,2d ) materials attracts much attention in view of striking differences between longitudinal and transverse transport mechanisms , revealing a general problematics of strongly correlated electronic systems @xcite . beyond a low field ( linear ) conduction , the whole tunneling current - voltage j - u characteristic @xmath13 and the conductivity @xmath14 are of particular importance . a common interest in tunneling phenomena in quasi 1d conductors has been further endorsed by recent experimental achievements ,",
    "see @xcite , and especially in new techniques of the intrinsic tunneling ( see @xcite for a short review ) where electronic interchain transitions take place in the bulk of the unperturbed material",
    ". particularly appealing is the access to topologically nontrivial excitations - solitons , showing up in subgap spectra @xcite .",
    "role of preexisting solitons in tunneling spectra of high-@xmath15 materials has been advocated in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is to describe their manifestations and peculiarities in incommensurate charge density wave ( icdw ) , see @xcite .",
    "the following content of this chapter will introduce experimental evidences , theoretical grounds and conditions for existence of solitons .",
    "chapter ii will describe the theoretical approach .",
    "chapter iii will give results of calculations , which details can be found in the appendix .",
    "if the tunneling processes were going between free electron states , as they have been formed by the rigid icdw , then the current onset would correspond to the voltage @xmath16 of the gap in the spectrum of electrons .",
    "but actually there is also a possibility for tunneling within the subgap region @xmath17 .",
    "it is related to the pseudogap ( pg ) phenomenon known for strongly correlated electrons in general , well pronounced in quasi 1d systems , and particularly in cases where the gap is opened by a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the pg is originated by a difference , sometimes qualitative , between short living excitations which are close to free electrons , and dressed stationary excitations of the whole correlated systems .",
    "the true excitations gain the energy , but loose the probability of transitions to these complex states . in the icdw , the dressing of a bare single particle results in self - trapped states like the amplitude solitons with energies @xmath18 below the free electron activation energy @xmath19 ; then the subgap interval @xmath20 will be observed as a pg . below this pair - breaking threshold @xmath21 (",
    "observed in optics , spin susceptibility ) , in tunneling there may be also contributions of collective states - phase solitons , which energy @xmath22 is even much lower .",
    "these states are activated in the bi - electronic channel - coherent tunneling of two electrons . in the 1d regime ( which we shall mostly address below )",
    "@xmath23 , then the subgap tunneling fils the whole pseudogap .",
    "strongly correlated electronic systems show various types of symmetry breaking originating degenerate ground states ( gs ) .",
    "the degeneracy gives rise to topologically nontrivial perturbations exploring the possibility of traveling among different allowed gss .",
    "of special interest are totally localized and truly microscopic objects , namely solitons ( or instantons for related transient processes ) which can carry single electronic quantum numbers : either spin @xmath24 or charge @xmath25 , or both .",
    "being energetically favorable with respect to electrons , solitons would determine the electronic properties which can be proved theoretically at least for quasi 1d systems .",
    "we address here the cases of a continuous gs degeneracy of an incommensurate cdw ( icdw ) ( see @xcite ) where solitons can be created in single items via single electronic processes .",
    "results can be generalized also to quasi-1d superconductors .",
    "continuous degeneracy of the icdw order parameter @xmath26 comes from an arbitrary chosen phase @xmath27 , which characterizes the freedom of translation @xmath28 of the icdw as a whole . at a first sight",
    ", the cdw is commonly viewed as a narrow gap anisotropic semiconductor with most of its properties described by free electrons @xmath25 or holes @xmath29 near the gap edges @xmath30 .",
    "thus , @xmath19 would give the activation energy in kinetics and thermodynamics characteristics ( conductivity , spin susceptibility , heat capacitance , nmr ) ; the same @xmath19 would be observed from dynamic probes as photoemission , external tunneling .",
    "the double gap @xmath31 would be measured as the edge in optics or in internal tunneling described below .",
    "doping or junction injection ( fet ) would require the threshold @xmath19 and lead to formation of electronic pockets near the gap edges .",
    "but actually _ almost nothing from this well established semiconducting picture _ takes place in icdws .",
    "1 . activation energies ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) measured from transport in the on - chain ( @xmath32 ) and in the interchain ( @xmath33 ) directions differ by several times ( typical values for tas@xmath34 are @xmath35  k and @xmath36  k @xcite ) which signifies an intrinsically different character of processes involved ; 2 .",
    "energies deduced from the spin activation @xmath37 @xcite and from the dynamic relaxation @xmath38 @xcite are in between @xmath39k ; 3 .",
    "optical absorption shows the peak at the scale of @xmath40 - thus associated to @xmath31 , but its shape is strongly smeared out with intensity deeply spread within the expected spectral gap @xcite - the pseudogap effect ; 4 .",
    "thresholds for charge transfer may not exist at all , or have low values compatible with @xmath32 - i.e. associated with the interchain decoupling scale , see @xcite ; 5 .",
    "charge injection results in absorption of additional electrons into the extended gs via so - called phase slip processes ( see @xcite ) , rather than in formation of fermi pockets . the static phase slip - a @xmath12 soliton as an on - chain cdw defect , has been directly observed in recent stm experiments @xcite .    . the vertical diameter line",

    "solitons in the icdw rise from strong interactions between electronic @xmath46 and collective ( amplitude @xmath47 and phase @xmath27 ) degrees of freedom , which is set up since all of them are modified by spontaneous formation of the new gs @xcite .",
    "electrons dressing by the collective deformations results in relatively heavy self - trapped particles with lower energies @xmath48 , which originates two basic scales .",
    "the high one can be observed , as @xmath31 or @xmath19 , for instantaneous processes like optics , tunneling , photoemission when the ground state has no time to adapt itself to a perturbation .",
    "the lower activation @xmath49 can be observed for fully relaxed dressed particles , which might dominate stationary effects of thermodynamics , kinetics , nmr , etc . ,",
    "see refs . in @xcite .",
    "the gs degeneracy gives a special character to these complex elementary excitations : they become _ topological solitons _",

    "they provide : 1 .",
    "spectral flow by transferring the split - off state @xmath56 between the gap edges @xmath57 , fig.[fig : theta - branches ] ; 2 .",
    "particle flow ( conversion of normal carriers to the collective gs ) between the conduction and the valence bands , which crosses the gap riding upon the split - off state ; 3 .",
    "microscopic phase slips , by adding / subtracting the @xmath12 winding of the order parameter .        for single - particle processes ( see reviews @xcite )",
    "the self - trapping of one electron at @xmath19 or of one hole at @xmath58 will proceed gaining the energy until the configuration takes a stable form of the amplitude soliton as : @xmath59 , fig.[fig : ampl - sol ] .",
    "now @xmath60 becomes a pure midgap state occupied by a single electron ; thus the soliton carries the electronic spin @xmath61 .",
    "curiously , the electric charge is zero rather than @xmath25 , being compensated by the dilatation of electronic wave functions of the filled band @xmath62 .",
    "it can be interpreted in a way that the as is symmetric with respect to the charge conjugation : it is the adaptation of an electron added to the gs of 2 m particles , as well as of a hole upon the gs of 2m+2 particles .",
    "( breaking of charge conjugation can be still treated within exact solutions @xcite - it gives a small electric charge to the as . ) thus , in a 1d system , the as is a realization of a spinon , the particle carrying the elementary spin 1/2 but no charge .",
    "this particle plays a central role in phenomenological pictures of strongly interacting electronic systems in general @xcite .",
    "theoretical value for the as energy is @xmath63 ; thus , the energy @xmath64 is gained by converting the electron into the soliton .",
    "excitation of the solitonic state takes place in those moments , when collective quantum fluctuations create an appropriate configuration with the necessary split - off intragap state @xcite . at first sight",
    ", one needs to prepare the as in its full form ( the diameter in the fig.[fig : chord - sol ] ) , the probability of which is very low .",
    "but actually the spontaneous deformation is more shallow .",
    "indeed , the energy @xmath65 is yielded by the transfer of a single electron ; hence the split - off energy level , prepared for this electron by the optimal fluctuations , must be at @xmath56  = @xmath66 ; therefore , the tunneling takes place when quantum fluctuations accumulate the chiral angle such that @xmath67  = @xmath68 , which gives @xmath69 , rather than @xmath70 .",
    "the tunneling threshold @xmath21 of the pair - breaking is required only for the single particle channel , while for the bi - particle channel there may be no need for an activation as if the system is still metallic .",
    "this expectation resides upon the fact that the gs of the icdw can incorporate a finite even amount of particles without paying an activation energy , unlike for odd numbers . for a finite length",
    ", the energy cost will be the same as for the metal : for each accommodated pair it is @xmath71 - vanishing for the large system length @xmath72 .",
    "the accommodation requires for the total cdw phase increment along the chain @xmath73 per the added pair ( see the branch @xmath74 at the fig.[fig : theta - branches ] ) .",
    "for the zero energy charge exchange between chains , it is necessary to adjust the number of states to the number of particles : that is at the chain @xmath75 to transfer the emptied level at @xmath58 just below the gap across the gap up to the manyfold of properly empty levels above @xmath76 ; the same time at the chain @xmath77 the empty level at @xmath76 must be drawn down across the gap to form a new level at @xmath58 which will accommodate the arrived pair .",
    "this job is done by a simultaneous phase slip processes of opposite directions : negative @xmath78 at the chain @xmath75 , and positive @xmath79 at the chain @xmath77 . with the vanishing , in 1d regime , of the phase slip energy @xmath80 , the optimal fluctuation will require for the exactly mid - gap split - off state @xmath81 , i.e. for @xmath82 , which is the as .",
    "hence the as becomes an optimal configuration , the barrier , for nucleation of the phase slip .    *",
    "effects of 2d,3s long range order . * in systems of correlated chains the local configuration must conform to the long range order . at long distances",
    "the phase @xmath27 must return to the mean value ( @xmath83 in our choice of fig.[fig : ampl - sol ] ) .",
    "the pure as ( vertical diameter ) is accompanied by phase tails ( arc lines ) adjusting the phase discontinuity @xmath84 to the asymptotic zero value . with the total increment @xmath85  = @xmath86 of the phase concentrated within these tails",
    ", they carry the electric charge @xmath25 , in addition to the spin 1/2 concentrated within the as core .",
    "the composed particle carries both of the electron quantum numbers , but they are localized at very different scales .",
    "contrary to the spin , the charge is not associated to a particular electron level ; the electric charge transfer by the tails of the as is rather the collective conduction promoted by ass . the price for the adaptation to the long range order is an increase of the as energy by an amount of the order of the transition temperature @xmath87 . for",
    "the phase soliton it becomes the scale of its total energy @xmath88 .",
    "recent tunneling experiments @xcite performed on quasi-1d materials with cdws , namely nbse@xmath34 and tas@xmath34 , can be interpreted as the first direct observation of solitons in dynamics .",
    "tunneling spectra of nbse@xmath34 @xcite show sharp peaks which are identified with the intergap tunneling at @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the two cdws coexisting in this material ( see figures 1b and 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "additional subgap features appear for both cdws , when the zero bias contribution of normal electrons is suppressed by high magnetic field or by temperature t ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "these quite strong peaks scale together with @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "this unexpected feature finds a natural interpretation in the above picture of solitons as special elementary excitations .",
    "@xmath93 appears as the threshold for the tunneling between the fermi level ( middle of the gap ) states of the electronic pocket , specific to @xmath94 , and the nonlinear multi - electronic complex - the amplitude soliton .",
    "the tunneling conductivity is also observed at even much lower voltages : @xmath95 ( see figures 1a,3a,5a in @xcite ) , which can be provided only by the bi - electronic channel @xcite . in the icdw",
    "it is realized via @xmath12 phase solitons , which correspond to one period of stretching / squeezing of one chain with respect to the surrounding ones .",
    "these are the elementary particles with the charge @xmath96 and the energy @xmath97 ( recall their recent visualization in @xcite ) , which gives the right order of magnitude both for the deep subgap tunneling range and for the longitudinal conductivity activation .",
    "the tunneling process corresponds to a coincidence of oppositely directed phase slips at neighboring chains , which transfer a pair of particle between their gs .",
    "a theory of these processes will be presented below in the section [ bi - e ] .",
    "we shall follow the adiabatic method @xcite , developed for the x - ray absorption ( pes , arpes ) , optics , and for tunneling in low symmetry systems supporting polarons .",
    "it assumes a smallness of collective frequencies , here of @xmath98 phonons @xmath99 , in comparison with the electronic gap : @xmath100 .",
