    "wormholes are space - time regions with two mouths connected by a throat .",
    "since the mouths are not hidden by event horizons and there is no singularity inside , wormholes permit the passage of massive particles or photons from one side to the other . morris and thorne@xcite shown that wormholes require the violation of the averaged null energy condition in order to satisfy the einstein field equations in the throat .",
    "thus , matter in this region must exert gravitational repulsion to make a stable configuration .",
    "the study of these solutions lead to an interesting question : may some observable electromagnetic signatures give the possibility of wormhole identification ?",
    "+ one of the most important applications of general relativity is gravitational lensing . since matter inside the wormhole antigravitate , cramer et .",
    "@xcite and safanova et .",
    "@xcite have studied the lensing effects of negative masses on light rays from point sources in the background , and argumented that this will be the effect produced by natural stellar - size wormholes .",
    "the study of lensing effects show that positive masses acts like convergent lenses , while the study of safanova et .",
    "al . for negative masses show that these act basically like divergent lenses .",
    "this means that the deflection angle is negative ( divergent ) .",
    "therefore , light from a point source will be concentrated on the border of an _ umbra region _ , producing two intensity enhancements : one before and one after the occultation event .",
    "+ recently , the scientific community started to look gravitational lensing from a strong field perspective .",
    "this limit refers to the effect produced by a very massive object and/or when the light rays that are affected pass very close to the lens .",
    "bozza @xcite provided an analytic method to calculate the deflection angle for any spherically symmetric spacetime in the strong field limit , and one important result of this is that a light ray with a very small impact parameter will wind one or several times around the lens before emerging , producing an infinite set of _ relativistic images_. + in this paper , we will use the method of bozza to calculate a more realistic lensing effect of morris - thorne wormholes , and it will permit us to show that wormhole spacetimes present a _ positive deflection angle _ ,",
    "i.e. wormholes does not act like divergent lenses in the general case .",
    "this means that exotic matter needed to construct the solutions does not have a direct observable signature for an outside observer .    in section",
    "ii we give the metric of the studied wormhole solutions , section iii gives the essential knowledge about strong gravitational lensing as described by bozza and in section iv we calculate the deflection angle for the presented wormholes .",
    "in section v we compare the obtained angles with the schwarzschilds deflection angle and finally , in section vi we put some conclusions .",
    "in the pionnering work of morris and thorne they describe a general class of solution of einstein equations representing wormholes .",
    "the conditions that they impose in order to obtain the general form of the metric tensor include :    \\1 .",
    "the metric must be spherically symmetric and static ( independient of time )    \\2 .",
    "the solution must have a throat joining two asymptotically flat regions of spacetime    \\3 .",
    "the metric must satisfy einstein equations in every point of spacetime    \\4 .",
    "the geometry will not have event horizons nor singularities    under these , the general form for the metric tensor is    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the redshift function and @xmath2 is the form function .",
    "when imposing condition 3 above , we obtain the relation between the functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the stress - energy tensor that produces the wormhole spacetime geometry . outside the wormhole , the spacetime is considered asimptotically flat and have a line element given by schwarzschild metric ,    @xmath3    the junction conditions that follow from the theory of general relativity are the continuity of the metric components and the extrinsic curvature across the surface of juncture .    to obtain specific solutions , in wormhole studies is usual to fix a spacetime geometry ( i.e. to fix the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 in order to obtain a wormhole geometry ) and then use the einstein equations to derive the matter distribution nedded to obtain the respective metric . folowing @xcite is easy to see that many wormhole geometries need _ exotic matter _ ( i.e. matter that does not obey the null energy condition ) to exist , and it is localizated at the throat of the wormhole .",
    "this need is what led cramer et .",
    "@xcite and safanova et .",
    "@xcite to model a wormhole as a point of negative mass to study gravitational lensing .",
    "in this paper we will consider only two specific wormhole solutions obtained by lemos et .",
    "al . @xcite . in both cases",
    "we will define @xmath6 as the radius of the throat and @xmath7 as the radius of the mouth of the wormhole .",
    "the first solution has an interior metric ( @xmath8 ) given by    @xmath9    and an exterior metric ( @xmath10 ) given by    @xmath11    since the exterior solution must represent schwarzschild metric , we can associate a mass to the wormhole , @xmath12    and as can be seen , the complete metric is smoothly joined at mouth radius @xmath7 .",
    "the second solution has an interior metric ( @xmath8 ) given by    @xmath13    and an exterior metric ( @xmath10 ) given by    @xmath14    again , the metric is smoothly joined at mouth radius @xmath7 , and since the exterior solution must represent schwarzschild metric , we associate a mass to the wormhole , @xmath15    both metrics represent wormholes connecting two asimptotically flat spacetimes , and to both of them we associate a positive external mass .",
    "this fact inspire us to think that a light ray that passes near the wormhole but not into it , will have a deflection similar to that produced by a schwarzschild geometry , while a light ray that goes into the wormhole will have a little different behavior .",
    "because of the arguments given in the preceding section , the gravitational lensing effects produced by a wormhole will be similar to those produced by a schwarzschild metric when the deflected light ray does not enter into the wormhole , but in order to obtain a mathematical expresion for the deflection angle of a light ray passing very close to the wormhole we will use the analytical method for strong field limit gravitational lensing of bozza @xcite .",
    "we consider the geometry as follows : a light ray from a source @xmath16 is deflected by the wormhole acting as a lens @xmath17 and reaches the observer @xmath18 .",
    "the background spacetime is asimptotically flat . the line joining lens and observer",
    "@xmath19 is the optic axis . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the angular position of the source and the image with respect to the optical axis , respectively . the distances between observer and lens , lens and source , and observer and source are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the relation between the position of the source and the position of the image is called the _ _ lens equation__@xcite ,    @xmath25,\\label{lenseq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the deflection angle . for a spherically symmetric spacetime with line element    @xmath27",
    "the deflection angle is given as a function of closest approach @xmath28 by    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    the method of bozza is to expand the integral in @xmath31 around the photon sphere to obtain a logarithmic expression for @xmath32 , and then , by using the lens equation , obtain the position of the produced images .",
    "the way to calculate the deflection angle produced by a wormhole depends on the closest approach of the light ray :      when the closest approach of the light ray is greater than wormhole s mouth ( @xmath33 ) , the deflection angle is produced only by the external metric .",
    "therefore , the lensing effect is , in this case , exactly the same as the produced by a schwarzschild metric with the correspondient mass .",
    "this angle is given @xcite by    @xmath34      since wormhole solutions described above are defined in two regions , when the closest approach of the light ray is inside wormhole s mouth ( @xmath35 ) , the deflection angle must be calculated as two contributions : first a deflection produced by the external schwarzschild - like metric , and second the contribution produced by the internal metric .    in both of the specific solutions given , the external contribution to the deflection angle is given as schwarzschild deflection above but with a closest approach equal to the wormhole s mouth ,    @xmath36    the contribution of the internal metric has to be calculated for each solution :      for the specific solution a described above we have    @xmath37    making the change @xmath38 we obtain    @xmath39    the integrand diverges for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , only the third of this values is in the integration range . because of this",
    ", we will expand the argument of the square root around this divergence up to the second order in @xmath43 .",
    "this gives    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    when @xmath46 is non - zero , the leading order of the divergence is @xmath47 , which can be integrated to give a finite result .",
    "when @xmath46 vanishes , the divergence is @xmath48 which makes the integral to diverge . in this way",
    ", the condition @xmath49 give us the radius of the photon sphere ,    @xmath50    this means that any photon with a closest approach distance @xmath51 will be capturated and it is interesant to note that the radius of the photon sphere does correspond to the throat radius .",
    "therefore , any photon with a closest approach distance less than the throat radius does not emerge in the same part of the universe , but goes into the wormhole to the other mouth .",
    "integral in ( [ int1 ] ) can be exactly made as    @xmath52.\\ ] ]    the total deflection angle for solution a is then    @xmath53      for the specific solution b , we have    @xmath54    this integral can be rewritten as    @xmath55    where @xmath38 .",
    "once more , the integrand diverges for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but we will consider only the third of this values . expanding the argument of the square root around this divergence up to the second order in @xmath43",
    "we have    @xmath56    where this time    @xmath57    the condition @xmath58 give us the radius of the photon sphere , and again we have    @xmath59    therefore the behavior of a photon near this radius is similar to the described before .",
    "the integral in ( [ int2 ] ) can be exactly made as    @xmath60,\\ ] ]    and the total deflection angle for solution b is    @xmath61",
    "as we have shown in the preceeding section , wormholes present an interesting lensing effect .",
    "photons with a closest approach distance greater than wormhole s mouth have a schwarzschild lensing effect , while photons with a closest approach distance less than wormhole s mouth have a schwarzschild lensing plus an inner lensing effect . because of this , is important to compare the deflection angle of wormholes with the deflection of schwarzschild ,        figure 1 . in the left side",
    "we have the deflection angle for the wormhole solution a ( continuous ) compared with schwarzschild s deflection angle ( dotted ) .",
    "wormhole s mouth is at @xmath62 ( in schwarzschild units ) , and the throat is at @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that the blue curve diverges at @xmath51 . in the right side we hae the deflection angle for the wormhole solution b ( continuous ) compared with schwarzschild s deflection angle ( dotted ) .",
    "wormhole s mouth is again at @xmath62 ( in schwarzschild units ) and the throat is at @xmath64 .",
    "the blue curve diverges exactly at @xmath51 . in both cases , outside wormhole s",
    "mouth the angles coincide .    from these graphics",
    "we can see that the deflection angle for light passing outside the wormhole is the same as the one produced by schwarzschild , and some differences appear when light goes inside .",
    "one of the most important is the divergence in the blue curves : they occur exactly at wormhole s throat , showing that this surface corresponds to a photon sphere .",
    "magnification is an important characteristic of gravitational lensing because it is easily observable .",
    "as is already known , magnification is given by    @xmath65    then , in order to obtain the magnification produced by a wormhole we will use the produced deflection angle and , using the lens equation ( [ lenseq ] ) , obtain a relation between the angular positions of the image @xmath66 and the source @xmath67 . since the deflection angle is calculated for each of the presented solutions , the magnification must be evaluated also for each wormhole .",
    "for the first of the presented solutions the magnification is given by :    @xmath68    where @xmath32 is the deflection obtained before and the derivative @xmath69 can be evaluated using a math software . if we plot the magnification as a function of the closest aproach we have the following curves .",
    "comparison of the magnification for schwarzschild s black hole ( left ) and wormhole a ( right ) . at this scale",
    "the curves look the same .",
    "wormhole s mouth is at @xmath62    as it is easily seen , the two curves look exactly the same .",
    "moreover , we can see the divergence that corresponds to the einstein ring as is expected because the mouth of the wormhole is situated inside this ring and the exterior metric is exactly the same as schwarzschild s metric .",
    "however if we made a zoom near the wormhole s mouth , we can see how in the wormhole s case , the magnification shows a discontinuity :        figure 3 .",
    "zoom of the magnification for wormhole a , near its mouth located at @xmath62    it is important to note that the discontinuity occurs exactly at the mouth of the wormhole , and it happens because here is were the matter distribution of the wormhole begins .",
    "it is also seen a little peak in the magnification curve inside the wormhole that is not seen in schwarzschild geometry",
    ".    moreover , when we change the wormhole s parameters , a very interesting behavior appears . in the next set of figures",
    "we can see the magnification curve for wormholes with different mouth sizes .",
    "figure 4.magnification curves for wormhole a with different mouth s sizes . in the first we have @xmath70 , in the second @xmath71 , in the third @xmath72 and in the fourth @xmath73.note that in each case we ohave a discontinuity at @xmath7 .",
    "it is easily seen , that when we change the mouth of the wormhole , the little peak inside grows .",
    "when the mouth of the wormhole is inside the einstein s ring radius the magnification behaves just as commented before , but when the mouth of the wormhole is greater that the einstein ring the peak in magnification of this ring dissapears and there appears a new peak produced by the wormhole .",
    "observationally , this fact shows an `` einstein s ring '' , shifted from the original position and this effect can be , in principle , measured .      for wormhole",
    "b we obtain a magnification given by the expression    @xmath74    again , we have here the deflection angle for solution b , @xmath32 and the derivative @xmath69 , that is evaluated using a math software .",
    "if we plot the magnification as a function of the closest approach @xmath75 , the curve looks exactly the same as the schwarzschild magnification ( just as for the wormhole soultion a in figure 2 . ) .",
    "however , when we make a zoom of the region near wormhole s mouth we get a little difference :        figure 5 .",
    "zoom of the magnification for wormhole b , near its mouth located at @xmath62    see how we have again a discontinuity localizated at the wormhole s mouth and a little peak inside the wormhole that makes the diference when compared with schwarzchild s geometry.just as in the specific solution b , the inside peak s position depends on the size of the wormhole s mouth .",
    "this fact is shown in the next set of figures :            figure 6.magnification curves for wormhole b with different mouth s sizes . in the first we have @xmath70 , in the second @xmath71 , in the third @xmath72 and in the fourth @xmath73.note that in each case we ohave a discontinuity at @xmath7 .",
    "again it is seen an observational difference in the magnification because there is a peak that does not correspond exactly to the einstein s ring but to the wormhole with a sufficiently greater mouth .",
    "gravitational lensing is one of the most important effects in general relativity . in this paper",
    "we have applied the strong field lensing method to morris - thorne wormholes and the analysis of the deflection angle and magnification produced by the two specific wormhole solutions described show that the behaviour of these objects is very similar to the behaviour of schwarzschild s solution . as can be seen from the graphics , there is a logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle , and there is a photon sphere that corresponds to the throat of the wormhole .",
    "this behavior contrast with the behaviour reported by cramer et .",
    "@xcite and safanova et .",
    "al.@xcite since their model for the wormhole is a negative punctual mass .",
    "altough the two solutions considered here need some exotic ( gravitationally negative ) mass inside , the behavior of light deflection does not differ significatively from the schwarzschild case .    on the other side ,",
    "magnification curves for the wormholes are similar to the obtained for schwazschild , but when looking in some detail , there is a discontinuity in the curve ( at the point where the mass distribution begins ) .",
    "it is also of great importance to note here that the size of the mouth of the wormhole affects the behavior of the magnification curve , and specially when the mouth of the wormhole is greater than the size of the einstein s ring . in this last case",
    "we see how a ring appears but it is not at the expected position for the einstein s ring , making a possible way to identify wormholes from other mass distributions as , for example , black holes ."
