    "one of the most studied classes of continuous phase transitions far from equilibrium is directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite .",
    "this transition occurs e.g. in stochastic lattice models for epidemic spreading , where infected sites either recover or infect a randomly selected nearest neighbor . depending on the rates for infection and recovery , an initial epidemics may spread or disappear .",
    "once the infection becomes extinct , the system enters a so - called absorbing state from where it can not escape .",
    "both regimes , survival and extinction , are separated by a well - defined phase transition .",
    "directed percolation is the simplest universality class of phase transitions into absorbing states  @xcite and plays a paradigmatic role similar to the ising model in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "critical phenomena can be studied by analyzing correlation functions . in dp",
    "an important example is the so - called _ pair - connectedness _ function @xmath1 which is defined as the probability to find a directed connected path from a lattice site located at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 to another site at position @xmath4 and time @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pair connectedness function is well defined below , at , and above the critical point and plays the role of a propagator in the field - theoretic formulation of dp .",
    "however , if one is interested in _ spatial _ correlations at a given instance of time the pair connectedness function does not provide any information because it vanishes for @xmath6 .",
    "this raises the question how a meaningful equal - time correlation functions can be defined in models with absorbing states .",
    "the simplest equal - time correlation function , which has been studied in various contexts , is the density - density correlation function @xmath7 , defined as the probability to find two sites at positions @xmath2 and @xmath4 simultaneously in the active ( infected ) state at time @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "this two - point function seems to be a natural candidate since it reminds us of a spin - spin correlation function in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "unfortunately this correlator depends on the history of the process .",
    "for example , if the system has not yet reached a stationary state , its value will depend on @xmath8 and the specific choice of the initial state . as a way out",
    ", one could measure the correlations in the stationary state , but then one is restricted to the active phase and the result will depend on the distance from criticality @xmath9 . to study the critical properties of the correlator , one has to keep the system in a slightly supercritical stationary state @xmath10 and to restrict the analysis to distances below the correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "this method is of course numerically inefficient and is further complicated by crossover effects .        to overcome this problem , dickman et .",
    "@xcite devised a method that allows one to study equal - time correlations at the critical point .",
    "starting point is the observation that the density of active sites in a finite system of lateral size @xmath12 at criticality first decays as usual , then stays for a while in a quasi - stationary state with a density @xmath13 , until it suddenly enters the absorbing state .",
    "the key idea is to prevent the system from entering the absorbing state .",
    "this is done by keeping a list of typical configurations sampled in the quasi - stationary state and to reimpose one of them whenever the system would have entered the absorbing state , thereby artificially keeping it in its lowest excited state .",
    "although this method became one of the standard tools in the study of absorbing phase transition , it is not entirely clear how the artificially stabilized state has to be interpreted . moreover , the method involves finite - size effects which have to be handled with care .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different type of equal - time correlation function which circumvents these difficulties .",
    "this correlator is defined as the probability that two points located at @xmath2 and @xmath4 at equal time have a _",
    "common ancestor somewhere in the past _ , meaning that this ancestor is connected to both points by directed paths ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) . note that it only matters whether this ancestor exists , but not where it is located in space and time .",
    "obviously , this definition can be generalized easily to @xmath0-point functions .",
    "compared to the conventional density - density function , the correlator proposed here has several advantages . as it is defined in terms of paths , it is by definition history - independent and well - defined in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , it can be analyzed everywhere in the phase diagram so that the trick by dickman et .",
    "al . is no longer needed .",
    "the main motivation for the present work came actually from a different direction . in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics the critical systems are usually not only scale - invariant but also conformally invariant . especially in two dimensions",
    "this symmetry restricts the possible universality classes strongly , leading to a finite classification scheme of such transitions .",
    "there have been various attempts to generalize this concept to non - equilibrium systems by introducing an anisotropic version of conformal invariance ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this concept was successfully applied to a large number of models but seemed to fail in the case of dp  @xcite .",
    "the ongoing debate triggered the question whether time - independent correlations of a two - dimensional dp process would exhibit not only scale - invariant but also conformal invariant features .",
    "this motivated us to search for a well - defined equal - time @xmath0-point function in dp , where the predictions of conformal invariance can be tested . at first glance",
    "it turned out that the correlation function defined above behaves like a conformally invariant one .",
    "however , extensive simulations reveal small violations .",
    "the equal - time @xmath0-point function @xmath15 introduced in this paper is defined as the probability that there exists a lattice site in the past , a so - called common ancestor , which is connected to all points by directed paths .",
    "let us first discuss the question how this correlator can be estimated efficiently in a numerical simulation . to this end",
    "one has to choose a realization of dp on a lattice . for reasons to be explained below ,",
    "we chose directed bond percolation , where the bonds of a diagonal lattice are open with probability @xmath16 and closed otherwise ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "activity percolates through open bonds along a preferred direction denoted as time .    to estimate the correlator defined above",
    ", we could generate a spatio - temporal configuration of open and closed bonds , select @xmath0 points with given distances and trace along the open paths backwards in time to see whether all points have a common ancestor .",
    "this is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] in the example of a three - point function in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "however , since the ancestor can be located anywhere , no matter how far it goes back time , any spatial or temporal restriction of the generated configuration of open and closed bonds will inevitably lead to finite - size effects .",
    "a more efficient method exploits the so - called rapidity reversal symmetry of dp which states that directed paths forward and backward in time have the same statistical weight .",
    "this allows us to reverse the direction of time , use the @xmath0 points as initial seeds of activity , and search for a common descendant in the future .",
    "note that the rapidity reversal symmetry is exactly fulfilled in the case of directed bond percolation , which explains why we chose this particular realization of dp .    to find out whether @xmath0 points have a common descendant ,",
    "imagine that each seed carries a color , as shown in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] . by definition",
    "the common descendant is a lattice site where all these colors mix for the first time . in a numerical simulation",
    "this intuitive color scheme can be implemented by associating a string of @xmath0 bits with each lattice site and assigning one of these bits to each of the seeds ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : configs ] ) . these bit patterns",
    "then percolate forward in time along the open bonds .",
    "if two different patterns arrive at the same site , they coagulate by an or operation .",
    "the first site carrying the bit pattern @xmath17 is a common descendant , corresponding to the common ancestor in the original situation . in this case",
    "the subroutine would return a ` 1 ' , indicating that a common ancestor exists .",
    "however , if one of the bits dies out before a common descendant has been identified , the simulation stops and returns a ` 0 ' .",
    "the actual value of the correlator is then estimated by averaging over many independent runs .",
    "technically , instead of using static arrays , it is advantageous to keep the coordinates of sites with a non - vanishing bit pattern in a dynamically generated list without restricting the range of the coordinates .",
    "this technique accelarates the simultion significantly and eliminates possible finite - size effects .",
    "moreover , it is useful to perform the simulation without a cutoff time until a ` 0 ' or a ` 1 ' is returned , which eliminates possible finite - time effects as well .",
    "the phenomenological scaling theory of absorbing phase transitions involves four independent critical exponents @xmath18 for the order parameter and its reponse field as well as the spatial and temporal correlation lengths  @xcite . in dp ,",
    "the rapidity reversal symmetry implies that @xmath19 , leaving three of the bulk exponents independent .",
    "moreover , it is useful to define the derived exponents @xmath20 in @xmath21 spatial dimensions the values of the critical exponents are not known exactly .",
    "numerical estimates are listed in table  [ tab : exp ] .",
    ".numerical estimates of the dp critical exponents in @xmath22 + 1 dimensions , see  @xcite and references therein . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : f ] we can see , that an equilateral triangle provides the higher value of @xmath23 , than a straight line .",
    "considering other constellations we saw that all other values of @xmath23 vary between these two .",
    "we plotted @xmath23 as a function of so - called normalized area of the triangle @xmath24 and could recognize a certain correlation between these variables ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] ) .",
    "both of them do not exceed a certain range : @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath23 grows with @xmath27 . although it was not possible to determine an exact function due to a large error range , this observation can be helpful for further study of the scaling function .     with short - range corrections as a function of the normalized area @xmath27 ( see eq .  ( [ eq : a_n ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath28 means that the three points lie on a straight line , and @xmath29  ( maximum value ) represents an equilateral triangle.,width=377 ]",
    "in this work we have introduced a novel kind of equal - time correlation function for directed percolation which is defined as the probability that @xmath0 points have a common ancestor in the past , no matter where this ancestor is located .",
    "this correlation function is well - defined in the whole phase diagram and does not depend on the history of the process . using the rapidity reversal symmetry , this correlation function can be related to the probability that the clusters generated by @xmath0 seeds will merge at some point in the future , which allows one to compute the correlator efficiently .    analyzing the scaling behavior of the three - point function we find that the universal scaling function is almost constant , which would be an indicator of conformal invariance .",
    "however , extensive simulations reveal a small variation of ( in one dimension ) less than one percent .",
    "the bottom line of this paper is a warning : some properties of directed percolation behave almost as if the process was conformally invariant , but high - precision simulations reveal that this is not the case .",
    "this means that numerical results can easily generate misleading expectations and have to be interpreted with care .",
