    "rapid oscillations are often seen in the optical , soft x - ray , and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) flux of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) during dwarf nova ( dn ) outbursts .",
    "these oscillations have periods in the range of @xmath1 , show a monotonic relationship with euv luminosity ( mauche 1996 ) and thus accretion rate , @xmath8 , and are fairly coherent ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "they are called dwarf nova oscillations ( dnos ; patterson 1981 ) in contrast to the much less coherent ( @xmath10 ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) also seen from cvs and the highly coherent oscillations ( @xmath11 ) that reflect the spin of a magnetic primary ( e.g. , dq her ) . since their discovery ( warner & robinson 1972 )",
    ", dnos have been seen in @xmath12 systems ( warner 2004 ) .",
    "the dno periods roughly track the surface keplerian period of the accreting white dwarf ( wd ) [ @xmath13 ; see fig .",
    "19 of patterson 1981 , or knigge et al . 1998 ] , so that it is generally believed that the oscillations are created near or on the wd surface .",
    "a number of explanations have been proposed for dnos , but none have quantitatively explained the majority of their key features .",
    "the characteristic period of the dnos , @xmath14 , implies a pulsational , rotational , or even perhaps inner accretion disk origin . since the period changes on the same timescale as accretion , it is improbable that the entire wd takes part in creating dnos , ruling out global _ g_-modes or the wd spin modulated by hot spots",
    "this led paczyski ( 1978 ) to suggest that if accretion torques were causing the period drifts then only a small amount of material is involved in making dnos ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "papaloizou & pringle ( 1978 ) studied rotationally modified global",
    "_ g_-modes and _",
    "r_-modes on wds .",
    "since truly global modes are not sensitive to the instantaneous accretion rate , they proposed that dnos are high radial - order modes that have large amplitudes near the wd surface .",
    "their work explains many of the properties of dnos , but some questions still remain , including : ( 1 ) what physical mechanism favors modes that are strongly concentrated in the outer layers of the star , ( 2 ) why the radiating area associated with dnos is such a small fraction of the total wd surface area ( @xmath16 to @xmath17 as inferred from the euv emission of ss cyg during dn outbursts ; crdova et al . 1980 ; mauche & robinson 2001 , hereafter mr01 ; mauche 2004 ) , and ( 3 ) why the modes are only excited during outbursts .",
    "these failings led others to suggest alternatives , including magnetic accretion onto a slipping belt ( warner & woudt 2002 ) and non - axisymmetric bulges on the inner part of accretion disks ( popham 1999 ) .",
    "inogamov & sunyaev ( 1999 ) presented a new way of studying disk accretion close to an accreting neutron star ( ns ) , which piro & bildsten ( 2004 ; hereafter pb04 ) extended to the case of wds . instead of using a boundary layer model ,",
    "they follow the latitudinal flow of accreted material over the stellar surface , starting at the equator and streaming up toward the pole , using a spreading layer ( sl ) model . in the case of",
    "wds the covering fraction ( which is equivalent to the spreading angle ) is found to be small , @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 ) , so that the size of the freshly accreted layer is set by the thickness of the accretion disk .",
    "the material in the sl is much hotter in temperature and lower in density than the underlying wd .",
    "this contrast allows waves in the sl to travel freely , unencumbered by the material below .",
    "we propose that dnos are shallow surface waves in the layer of recently accreted material confined to the wd equator .",
    "we argue that the @xmath5 mode provides the period that is most often identified as a dno , and we show that the @xmath6 prograde mode explains the occurrence of some of the higher frequency dnos , including the extra periods seen from ss cyg and vw hyi ( mr01 ; woudt & warner 2002 ) .",
    "we also discuss the @xmath7 retrograde mode and whether it also corresponds to an observed frequency . in ",
    "2 we describe a simple model to estimate the shallow surface wave periods and show how they scale with @xmath8 and the wd mass and radius .",
    "we then compare these periods to observed dnos from cvs in  3 .",
    "we conclude in  4 with a summary of the dno properties successfully understood using our model along with a discussion of problems that are still left unresolved .",
    "patterson ( 1981 ) showed that ( at the time ) all known dnos on wds with measured masses have @xmath21 .",
    "this relation is an important constraint for any explanation of dnos , so we begin by showing why a sl mode should mimic such a period .",
    "the geometry of the sl is a thin , quickly spinning , layer in hydrostatic balance , which is predicted both observationally ( mauche 2004 ) and theoretically ( pb04 ) to cover a fraction of the surface area @xmath22 . in situations where there is a large entropy contrast between a surface layer and the underlying material , nonradial oscillations can be confined to high altitude regions with little or no pulsational energy extending deeper into the wd .",
    "when the horizontal wavelength is much greater than the layer depth , these shallow surface waves have a frequency @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the surface gravitational acceleration decreased by centrifugal effects , @xmath25 is the pressure scale height of the layer , and @xmath26 is the transverse wavenumber .",
    "the sl can be thought of as a waveguide with latitudinal width @xmath27 and azimuthal length @xmath28 , but since @xmath29 the latitudinal contribution dominates so that @xmath30 .",
    "setting @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the spin of the layer , we rearrange the terms in equation ( 1 ) to find @xmath33 which shows that the mode s frequency is the keplerian frequency times a factor less than unity ( as long as @xmath34 ) , and therefore explains why these shallow waves are consistent with the findings of patterson ( 1981 ) .    to find how these modes scale with @xmath8 and the wd mass we consider a simple model to estimate @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the theoretical studies of pb04 suggest that in the @xmath8 range of dn the covering fraction , @xmath35 , may be set by the thickness of the accretion disk resulting in ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; in the limit of gas pressure much greater than radiation pressure and using kramer s opacity ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the viscosity parameter for the accretion disk and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and we set the factor @xmath43\\approx1 $ ] .    as long as the wd is rotating at much less than breakup ( gnsicke et al .",
    "2001 ) , half of the accretion luminosity is released in a layer at the wd surface , so that the flux of this layer is given by @xmath44 . in a one - zone layer",
    "the radiative flux equation can be integrated to give @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the radiation constant , @xmath47 is the opacity ( set to @xmath48 for thomson scattering with a solar composition ) , and @xmath49 is the column depth of the layer ( measured in units of @xmath50 ) . the column depth is set by continuity to be @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the timescale for viscous dissipation in the sl .",
    "the viscosity between the fresh , quickly spinning material and the underlying wd is given by @xmath53 ( pb04 ) , where @xmath54 is the sl s viscosity parameter , and @xmath55 is the initial azimuthal velocity of the material in the sl . using an ideal gas equation of state , we find the lowest order mode , which does not propagate in the azimuthal direction so we denote it with an azimuthal wavenumber @xmath5 , has a period @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . equation ( 4 ) provides both a scaling and period suggestive of dnos .",
    "we discuss these similarities in more detail when we compare to observations in  3 . if we instead take @xmath59 ( in analogy to a shakura & sunyaev accretion disk ) , where @xmath60 is the speed of sound , we find @xmath61 , also similar to observations .",
    "this shows the robustness of this idea in replicating the general scalings of dnos .",
    "the arguments from above suggest that the sl can contain additional modes , most notably those that propagate in the azimuthal direction .",
    "these modes have an observed frequency of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the spin of the sl and @xmath4 is the azimuthal wavenumber .",
    "since the layer is spinning quickly , it is possible that coriolis effects will modify @xmath26 , which has been studied in the limit of a thin layer using the `` traditional approximation '' ( see bildsten , ushomirsky & cutler 1996 and references therein ) . using this analysis , coriolis effects are negligible since @xmath64 .",
    "if we set @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , the next lowest order modes ( still @xmath67 ) have periods @xmath68 since there are a few dnos with @xmath69 ( as we discuss in  3 ) , we propose that the prograde @xmath6 mode is also necessary for explaining some short period dnos .",
    "it is less clear whether the @xmath7 retrograde mode is consistent with an oscillation observed during a dn outburst , and in  3 we speculate whether this mode may be related to the long - period dnos ( lpdnos ; warner , woudt & pretorius 2003 ) .",
    "we compare the most recent compilations of dno periods ( table 1 of warner 2004 ) and wd masses ( ritter & kolb 2003 ) of cvs in figure 1 .",
    "the period error bars indicate the range of periods that have been seen from each object , while the mass error bars indicate the errors . we plot systems that have shown both high and low dno periods as two separate points ( these cvs are ss cyg , cn ori , and vw hyi ) .",
    "the thick , dashed line denotes the surface keplerian period , @xmath70 , for a given wd mass ( using the mass - radius relation of truran & livio 1986 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that there are dnos both above and below @xmath70 , which is why we consider sl nonradial oscillations with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for each mode we present periods for accretion rates @xmath71 , the range expected during a dn outburst . to calculate the @xmath6 mode",
    "we must assume a period for the sl s spin , @xmath72 , so we plot mode periods for both @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that our model is insensitive to the choice of the sl spin rate .",
    "besides predicting multiple classes of dnos with different period ranges , we also predict that each of these groups will have a different dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "this can be seen from the size of each shaded band , which is much wider for the @xmath5 mode than the @xmath6 mode . on average the dnos with @xmath69",
    "show less variation with @xmath8 , qualitatively consistent with the @xmath6 mode of our model . to investigate the @xmath8 dependence in more detail we plot our predicted dno periods versus @xmath8 for an @xmath75 wd in figure 2 .",
    "this illustrates the shallower dependence for the @xmath6 mode .",
    "the separation and relative slopes of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 modes are suggestive of the frequency doubling that was seen by mr01 during the 1996 october outburst of ss cyg . in both",
    "the beginning and tail of the burst , they saw a dno with @xmath76 and following a @xmath2 power law with @xmath77 .",
    "near the burst peak , @xmath78 suddenly shifted to @xmath79 and then decreased with a shallower power law with @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , we find similar periods and power laws when we use a larger wd mass .    in figure 2",
    ", we also plot the @xmath7 retrograde mode for @xmath81 .",
    "owing to the difference taken in equation ( 5 ) , this mode has a much more complicated dependence on @xmath8 , no longer being a power law nor monotonic .",
    "this mode has a higher period than typical dnos , and may be relevant for the lpdnos .",
    "warner ( 2004 ) identified 17 cvs as showing such oscillations .",
    "the lpdnos typically have larger amplitudes than dnos and , like dnos , are not seen in every dn outburst .",
    "often , both of these oscillations are seen simultaneously . to positively identify these as modes requires checking for the predicted scalings between @xmath78 and @xmath8 .",
    "this test may negate a mode explanation for lpdnos since warner , woudt & pretorius ( 2003 ) claim to find no such correlation for these oscillations and thus favor a spin - related mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , on separate occasions there have been @xmath82 ( robinson & nather 1979 ) and @xmath83 ( mauche 2002b ) oscillations seen from ss cyg , in the domain expected for these modes .",
    "this wide spread of periods may be explained by the @xmath7 mode s steeper dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath82 oscillations showed much less coherence than typical dnos , which could be a result of the retrograde oscillations beating against the accretion disk .",
    "other cvs such as vw hyi show similar modes in the range of @xmath84 ( haefner , schoembs & vogt 1977 , 1979 ) , which may be of similar origin .",
    "we propose that dnos in outbursting cvs are nonradial oscillations in a hot layer of freshly accreted material near the wd equator . a large number of dno properties",
    "are then simply understood : ( 1 ) the highly sinusoidal nature of the oscillations is consistent with nonradial oscillations , ( 2 ) the periods can change on the timescale of accretion because there is little mass in the layer ( @xmath85 ; pb04 ) , ( 3 ) the periods vary inversely with @xmath8 because they have the temperature scaling of shallow surface waves , ( 4 ) the covering fraction is naturally small for the sl , ( 5 ) the dnos are only seen during dn outbursts because this is the only time when an optically thick layer of material can build up at the equator , and ( 6 ) the largest pulsed amplitude is in the euv , consistent with the sl temperature .    in support of our hypothesis , we presented a simple , phenomenologically motivated model that quantitatively explains many of the dno s features .",
    "we compared our model with the overall population of dnos , both as a function of wd mass and accretion rate . in each case , it is necessary to consider both the @xmath5 mode and the @xmath6 ( prograde ) mode to explain the range of periods observed and the different @xmath78-@xmath8 scalings .",
    "the majority of dnos are consistent with the period of the @xmath5 mode , and this may be related to its latitudinal propagation .",
    "the speed of shallow surface waves is @xmath86 so that they slow down as the scale height decreases .",
    "this steers an initially azimuthally propagating mode to instead travel perpendicular to the sl edge , similar to ocean waves at the beach , and may explain why @xmath5 modes are favored over @xmath87 modes . in the 1996 dn outburst of ss cyg ( mr01 ) , the @xmath6 mode is only seen near the outburst peak .",
    "this may indicate that a wide enough region without differential rotation is only present when there is sufficient spreading at high @xmath8 .",
    "there are still many difficulties that must be addressed about this idea for explaining dnos . from the sl model ( pb04 )",
    "we borrowed the concept of hot material in hydrostatic balance covering a small fractional area of the wd , but we ignored important details of these calculations , such as differential rotation and the change of scale height with latitude .",
    "the data do not require such additional complications , so we refrain from including them for now . in a more sophisticated model , it would probably still be true that @xmath88 , but an eigenvalue calculation would determine the constant of proportionality .",
    "a full calculation may also help explain the variety of power laws , @xmath89 , for various cvs , since our model only predicts one unique power law index for the @xmath5 mode .",
    "the wd spin ( which has so far been neglected ) may be an important differentiating variable as well .",
    "another important property of wds that would affect the modes is a magnetic field .",
    "a strong field inhibits shearing between the sl and wd and modifies the frequency of shallow surface waves .",
    "it is therefore interesting that no intermediate polars ( ips ) have shown dnos or lpdnos .",
    "even ls peg and v795 her , neither of which are ips , but both showing polarization modulations ( rodrquez - gil et al . 2001 , 2002 )",
    "indicative of a reasonably strong magnetic field , are without dnos or lpdnos .",
    "further studies should also work toward an understanding of the excitation mechanism for the modes , which would help explain the high coherence typical of dnos .",
    "material deposited at the wd equator spreads fairly quickly , @xmath90 ( pb04 ) , so that this material must be moving through the oscillating region on timescales of order the mode period . in light of the many strengths of the sl mode explanation of dnos",
    "we do not abandon it because of this problem , but this is definitely a weakness that puts limits any proposed excitation mechanism .",
    "our explanation of dnos raises interesting questions about the relationship between oscillations originating from accreting compact objects .",
    "mauche ( 2002b ) showed that there is a strong correlation in the high to low oscillation frequency ratio of wds , nss , and black holes ( bhs ) . using this picture , dnos",
    "are associated with the kilohertz qpos of low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "suggestively , the fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy of nss ( gilfanov , revnivtsev & molkov 2003 ) imply that both the normal branch oscillations and the kilohertz qpos are created in the ns boundary layer , strengthening the possibility that our sl mode model may also apply in this case . for a typical ns mass and radius our model results in frequencies in the range expected for khz qpos , but it does not explain their complicated @xmath78-@xmath91 relation ( the `` parallel tracks ; '' van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , dnos may also show the parallel tracks phenomenon , as seen in three observations of ss cyg ( mauche 2002a ) , once again supporting the correlation . on the other hand , continuing the analogy to wd and bh oscillations is problematic because in the case of bhs there is no surface for nonradial oscillations .",
