    "@xmath0 gravity examines the possibility of modifying einstein s general relativity ( gr ) by adding terms proportional to powers of the ricci scalar @xmath6 to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the cosmological interest in these theories comes from the fact that they can naturally exhibit an accelerating expansion phase of the universe without introducing dark energy . however , the freedom in the choice of different functional forms of @xmath0 gives rise to the problem of how to constrain the many possible @xmath0 gravity theories on theoretical and/or observational grounds . in this regard , much efforts have been developed so far , mainly from the theoretical viewpoint  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "general principles such as the so - called energy conditions  @xcite , nonlocal causal structure  @xcite , have also been taken into account in order to clarify its subtleties .",
    "more recently , observational cons traints from several cosmological data sets have been explored for testing the viability of these theories  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect that is worth emphasizing concerns the two different variational approaches that may be followed when one works with @xmath0-gravity theories , namely , the metric and the palatini formalisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the metric formalism",
    "the connections are assumed to be the christoffel symbols and the variation of the action is taken with respect to the metric , whereas in the palatini variational approach the metric and the affine connections are treated as independent fields and the variation is taken with respect to both .",
    "in fact , these approaches are equivalents only in the context of gr , i.e. , in the case of linear hilbert action ; for a general @xmath0 term in the action , they provide completely different theories , with almost no similarities and very distinct equations of motion . in this _ brief report _ we will restrict ourselves to the palatini formalism . by discussing the deceleration / acceleration history of the universe through the evolution of the deceleration parameter @xmath3 , we place stringent bounds on a class of @xmath0 theory given by @xmath7 . in particular , we find that the range of negative values of @xmath2 predicts a behavior that is grossly inconsistent with cosmological observations ( e.g. cmb  @xcite ) , being therefore ruled out even if it is compatible with supernova , lensing statistics and local gravity constraints .",
    "@xmath0 cosmologies are based in the modified einstein equations of motion derived from the dubbed @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the action that defines an @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath12 is the standard action for the matter fields .",
    "treating the metric and the connection as completely independent fields , variation of this action with respect to the metric provides the field equations @xmath13 while variation with respect to the connection gives @xmath14 in ( [ field_eq ] ) @xmath15 is the matter energy - momentum tensor which , for a perfect - fluid , is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy density , @xmath18 is the fluid pressure and @xmath19 is the fluid four - velocity . here , we adopt the notation @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the second equation ( [ connections_eq ] )",
    "give us the connections @xmath22 , which are related with the christoffel symbols @xmath23 of the metric @xmath24 by @xmath25 note that in ( [ field_eq ] ) , @xmath26 must be calculated in the usual way , i.e. , in terms of the independent connection @xmath22 , given by ( [ connections ] ) and its derivatives .",
    "we assume a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker universe whose metric is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "the generalized friedmann equation , obtained from ( [ field_eq ] ) , can be written in terms of the redshift parameter @xmath29 and the density parameter @xmath30 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the matter density today . in terms of these quantities ,",
    "the trace of eq .",
    "( [ field_eq ] ) provides an important relation : @xmath33",
    "cosmographic parameters linked to geometry play a key role in cosmology . in particular , the deceleration parameter , defined as @xmath34 , can be written in terms of @xmath35 and its derivative as @xmath36 in what follows we use ( [ fe3 ] ) and ( [ q(z ) ] ) to place constraints on the free parameters ( @xmath37 ) of one of the most extensively discussed @xmath0 theory , i.e. , @xmath38 note that positive values of @xmath2 provide ir modifications of gr while negative ones correspond to high - energy corrections .",
    "for @xmath39 this kind of gravity reduces to einstein s general relativity plus a cosmological constant , @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that , for a theory like ( [ first - f ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ trace2 ] ) evaluated at @xmath41 imposes the following relation between @xmath42 and the pair ( @xmath43 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the value of the ricci scalar today .",
    "note also that @xmath45 can be determined from the algebraic equation resulting from equating ( [ fe3 ] ) and ( [ trace2 ] ) for @xmath41 .",
    "hence , specifying the values of two of these parameters the third is automatically fixed .",
    "in other words , in the palatini approach , one of the two free parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be eliminated by the constraint ( [ alpha - relation ] ) .",

    "however , a glance through table 1 shows that cosmological tests are indeed inconclusive about the true signal of @xmath2 .",
    "this in turn gives rise to the following question : what kind of corrections to gr do theories like ( [ first - f ] ) indeed represent ?",
    "the answer to this question surely depends of the signal of the parameter @xmath2 . in what follows ,",
    "we show that some light can be shed on this discussion just by examining the signal of @xmath3 , as given by ( [ q(z ) ] ) and taking into account ( [ fe3])([trace2 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ q - versus - z ] we show the evolution of the deceleration parameter with @xmath52 for several values of @xmath2 and @xmath53 , which corresponds to the best - fit value found from a joint analysis involving sne ia + bao + cmb + @xmath35 data  @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ q - versus - z ] , for positive values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 approaches the standard @xmath54cdm evolution at intermediary redshifts and the universe has only one recent transition toward an accelerating universe . in this case",
    ", the transition redshift does not vary considerably with @xmath2 .    on the other hand , negative values of @xmath2",
    "have great influence on the @xmath3 evolution .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath0 models given by ( [ first - f ] ) with @xmath55 predicts an always accelerating universe , which is clearly incompatible with a past dark matter - dominated epoch ( and the standard @xmath56 law ) , whose existence is fundamental for the structure formation process to take place is slightly dependent on the matter density parameter in the [ 0.1 , 0.3 ] . ] .",
    "note that for @xmath57 these modified scenarios predict two recent periods of acceleration separated by a deceleration phase .",
    "[ z - transiction ] shows the first transition redshift @xmath58 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the first epoch of acceleration is pushed to higher redshifts as @xmath2 approaches zero from negative values and that such an effect is extremely sensitive to this parameter .",
    "for instance , for @xmath59 the first transition happens at very high @xmath52 ( @xmath60 ) whereas for @xmath61 it occurs during the matter epoch ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , although we have plotted figs .",
    "[ q - versus - z ] and  [ z - transiction ] for a single value of @xmath42 (= 0.26 ) , we have indeed repeated our analysis for a larger interval ( @xmath63 $ ] ) .",
    "we found that the behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath58 is very similar to the one shown in both figures , which means that for the current allowed range of the matter density parameter , negative values of @xmath2 are incompatible with a past matter - dominated epoch .",
    "this means that to be consistent with cosm ological observations from lss and cmb data the only correction to gr from a @xmath0-gravity like ( [ first - f ] ) is a ir modification ( @xmath64 ) . note that an exception to this conclusion is the limit @xmath65 ( from negative values ) , which for all practical purposes is equivalent to the late - time evolution of the standard @xmath54cdm scenario .",
    "cosmological models based on @xmath0 gravity may exhibit a natural acceleration mechanism without introducing a dark energy component .",
    "however , in order to provide a realistic alternative describing the late - time dynamics of the universe , it is qualitatively well accepted ( since the current observational data are inconclusive to this respect ",
    "see table i ) that such theories must provide only an ir correction to gr . in this paper",
    ", we have discussed quantitatively this question by studying the evolution of the deceleration parameter with @xmath52 and imposing the existence of a past matter - dominated epoch . for the class of @xmath0 gravity given by ( [ first - f ] ) , we have shown that negative values of @xmath2 ( high - energy correction ) predict either an always accelerating universe ( which is inconsistent with the past structure formation process ) or two periods of acceleration separated by a deceleration phase .",
    "these results show that even passing the background tests ( such as supernova ) and escaping from local gravity constraints practically the entire branch of negative values of @xmath2 is ruled out by the cosmographic bounds discussed here .",
