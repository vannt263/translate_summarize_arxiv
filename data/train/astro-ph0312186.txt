    "each individual exposure was corrected for optical distortion before creating the final , coadded image as follows .",
    "a set of stars common to our images and those of digital sky survey was selected , and a second order spatial transformation applied to bring our images into an orthographically projected astrometric frame .",

    "our object detection and analysis technique is based on that developed by kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 ; hereafter ksb ) . for gravitational lensing analyses ,",
    "there have been several investigations to determine the optimal method for measuring galaxy shapes , correcting for non - gravitational shape distortions , and calibrating gravitational shear estimates from galaxy shape data ( e.g. , ksb with extensions developed by hoekstra 1998 ; luppino & kaiser 1997 ; kuijken 1999 ; kaiser 2000 ) . for ground based data , and the relatively small psf encountered here ,",
    "the standard ksb + luppino / kaiser ( lk ) algorithm is adequate for correcting point spread function anisotropies and for the losses due to seeing and pixelization .",
    "both the previous x - ray studies and our optical observations as reported below indicate that clj  0152.7@xmath11357 has a complex morphology exhibiting two major concentrations .",

    "this image has been corrected for exposure and smoothed using the ciao tool _ csmooth _ with a minimum significance of 3 and a maximum significance of 5 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emissions cover a @xmath27 ( @xmath28 mpc@xmath29 ) region , with two clear peaks at ra = 01@xmath3052@xmath3144@xmath32.1 , dec = @xmath113@xmath3357@xmath3422@xmath35.3 ( j2000 ; northeastern clump ) , and ra = 01@xmath3052@xmath3139@xmath32.7 , dec = @xmath113@xmath3358@xmath3430@xmath35.1 ( j2000 ; southwestern clump ) , respectively .",
    "the projected distance between the peaks is about @xmath36 ( 0.7 mpc ) .",
    "both clumps are reasonably symmetrically shaped and only slightly elongated in the northeast - southwest direction .",
    "this suggests that the cluster is in a pre - merger state .",
    "the ne clump is larger in extension but less luminous than the sw clump .    in figure 2 , we show the r - band image obtained with the _ keck _ telescope in a 4 ks exposure , on which the _ chandra _ x - ray intensity contours are overlaid in logarithmic scales , and blow - up of the two cores in the _ keck _ image , possible strong lensing features around the ne and sw clumps are visible in the deep _ keck _ images . in the r band ,",
    "the spatial distribution of galaxies also shows two similar concentrations .",
    "however , we notice that the optical peaks do not exactly coincide with the x - ray peaks .",
    "the offset are @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the ne and sw clumps , respectively .",
    "this further supports the conjecture that the cluster is not in a dynamical equilibrium state , and may be undergoing a merger .    a close inspection of the _ chandra _ and keck images show a third x - ray faint clump to the east of the major structure , just north of a bright star .",
    "an overdensity of galaxies as red as those in the two main clump is apparent in the _ keck _ color images .",
    "optical counterparts of the 5 embedded x - ray point - like sources have also been identified ( table 2 and fig .",
    "2 ) . these sources are too faint to allow a study of their x - ray spectra , we therefore calculate their hardness ratios defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the net counts in 0.31.5 kev and 1.57 kev , respectively .",
    "we find that the obtained hardness ratios differ greatly , inferring that these sources are of different origins . besides their optical positions ,",
    "no further information about the optical or radio counterparts of these point - like sources was found in the literature or online databases .",
    "we extracted the 0.5 - 8 kev spectra and analyzed them with xspec ( v11.2.0 , arnaud 1996 ) software .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source - free regions adjacent to the cluster on the acis i3 chip .",
    "corrections for the degradation of the quantum efficiency at low energies were made .",
    "we also computed hardness ratios for the entire cluster and the two clumps separately .",
    "the hardness ratios were defined in the same way as in  3.1 except that the soft and hard bands were this time chosen to be 0.52 kev and 28 kev , respectively .",
    "we find that the hardness ratios of the two clumps are consistent with each other , suggesting a similar temperature ( table 3 ) .",
    "* the entire cluster : * we extracted the global spectrum of the entire cluster by combining two circular regions , one centered at the peak of each clump .",
    "we fitted the combined spectrum with the absorbed mekal model designed for photoelectric absorbed emission emitted from isothermal gas in collisional equilibrium . in the spectral fits",
    ", we fixed the column density of the neutral hydrogen to the galactic value ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum and the best - fit model are showed in figures 34 and table 4 , where results from previous work are also listed for comparison .",
    "the best - fit gas temperature is @xmath44 kev , or @xmath45 kev if the icm abundance is fixed at 0.3 of the solar value . with our best - fit model",
    ", we estimate that the unabsorbed flux in 0.52 kev is @xmath46 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 , corresponding to an isotropic 0.52 kev luminosity of @xmath47 erg s@xmath15 . in the 210 kev band ,",
    "the unabsorbed flux and luminosity are @xmath48 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 and @xmath49 erg s@xmath15 respectively .",
    "the measured _ chandra _ temperature is consistent with the _ rosat _ and _ bepposax _ measurements ( d00 ) , while the calculated x - ray fluxes are lower by 42% and 38% than those obtained with _ rosat _ ( @xmath50 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 ) and _ bepposax _ ( @xmath51 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 ) respectively .",
    "we found that the difference is primarily caused by contamination from embedded point - like sources which were not subtracted in the previous analyses .",
    "we then estimate the contribution of point - like sources by fitting their global spectrum with the same model as cluster ( in order to compare with the results from _ rosat _ and _ bepposax _ ) , and find their unabsorbed flux is @xmath52 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 and @xmath53 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the sum of flux from cluster and point - like sources from the _ chandra _ data is consistent with the _ rosat _ and _ bepposax _ measurements .    * the two clumps : * we extracted the spectra of the two clumps separately from circular regions centered on the peak of each clump .",
    "again , the background spectra were extracted from adjacent source - free regions , and the spectra were fitted with the absorbed mekal model .",
    "spectra and best fit models are shown in figure 5",
    ". the best - fit temperatures , obtained by fixing the @xmath54 absorption to the galactic value and the metal abundance to the canonical value of 0.3 solar , are @xmath55 kev for the ne clump , and @xmath56 kev for the sw clump ( table 5 ) .",
    "if the abundance is left free , the gas temperatures do not change significantly . at the 90% confidence level ,",
    "the temperatures of the two clumps are consistent with each other .",
    "the unabsorbed 210 kev flux of the ne and sw clumps are @xmath57 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 ( 61@xmath587% of the entire cluster ) and @xmath59 erg @xmath43 s@xmath15 , respectively .      using the 0.310 kev image corrected with a weighted exposure map , we extracted the azimuthally - averaged radial surface brightness profiles of the two clumps separately .",
    "embedded point - like sources were masked out and the background was also fitted in this procedure .",
    "* @xmath4-model : * first we attempt to describe the surface brightness profiles with a single @xmath4-model , which takes the form @xmath60^{-3\\beta+0.5}+s_{\\rm b},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the core radius , @xmath4 is the index parameter , @xmath62 is the background , and @xmath63 is the normalization . the best - fit models together with the observed profiles are shown in figure 6 and table 6 .",
    "we find that the surface brightness profiles of the outer regions of the two clumps can be well fitted with the @xmath4-model . in the central ( @xmath64 kpc ) regions , however , the observed profiles are underestimated .",
    "the calculated reduced @xmath65 is 1.36 for the ne clump and 1.22 for the sw clump . also , we find that the ne clump has a larger core radius than the sw clump .",
    "we have tried to improve the fit of the central regions of the two clumps , where a surface brightness excess is visible , by adding a second @xmath4-model .",
    "such a method has been successfully applied for example in `` cooling flow '' clusters .",
    "the poor statistics in our case , however , prevent us from constraining the additional parameters of the double @xmath4-model .",
    "* nfw - like model : * an alternative way to compensate for the central brightness excess is to utilize models that are more centrally concentrated than the @xmath4-model . to this aim , we have fitted the observed surface brightness profiles with the model expected for the gas distribution following an nfw - like halo profile as suggested in cosmological n - body simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) . in this case , the gas distribution has an analytic form of ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ; wu 2000 ) @xmath66 which , in order to avoid the divergence in the computation of x - ray surface brightness , has been normalized so that @xmath67/[n_{\\rm   gas}(0)-n_{\\rm gas}(\\infty)]$ ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the average molecular weight , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the characteristic density and length , respectively .",
    "the surface brightness profile can correspondingly be calculated in term of @xmath73 , where the integral is performed along the line of sight .",
    "this yields @xmath74 ( 1+x)^{\\alpha / x}\\left[\\frac{1}{1+x}-\\frac{{\\rm ln}(1+x)}{x}\\right ]   { \\rm d}x+ s_{\\rm b},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the dimensionless radius .",
    "the best - fit surface brightness profiles predicted by the nfw - like model are presented in figure 7 and table 6 .",
    "the calculated reduced @xmath65 is 1.59 for the ne clump and 1.46 for the sw clump .",
    "it appears that the nfw - like model does not give a better global fit to the surface brightness profiles of the two clumps ; however , it does improve the fit to the central regions .      with the information obtained with the x - ray data , we have estimated the gravitational mass of clj  0152.7@xmath11357 in three ways .",
    "first , we calculate the virial mass of the cluster by using the cosmic virial theorem ( bryan & norman 1998 ) @xmath76^{1/3 }    = 1.39\\,f_{\\rm t}\\,(\\frac{m}{10^{15 }     m_{\\odot}})^{2/3}\\,(h^2\\delta_{\\rm c }     e^2)^{1/3}\\,{\\rm kev},\\ ] ] where the normalization factor is @xmath77 , the overdensity parameter is @xmath78 , and @xmath79\\}^{1/2}$ ] . because the _ chandra _ temperature of the whole cluster is @xmath80 kev ,",
    "the calculated virial mass is @xmath81 .",
    "second , we calculate the mass distribution by assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and the gas is isothermal . in this case",
    "the total mass within a radius @xmath82 can be expressed as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electron number density that can be inferred from the observed surface brightness profile with the best - fit @xmath4-model .",
    "the calculated radial mass distribution for the two clumps are shown in figure 8 .    the third way to determine",
    "the mass distribution is to employ the universal nfw profile , in this case we have @xmath85.\\ ] ] the derived mass profiles of the two clumps are also shown in figure 8 .",
    "it turns out that the latter two methods give essentially the same mass estimates except for the central regions , which may be caused by the failure of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption in the core of the cluster , or by departure from the isothermality assumption adopted in the @xmath4-model .",
    "mass determinations from weak gravitational lensing analyses are considered necessarily lower estimates on the true mass of the system . in contrast with x - ray estimates ,",
    "gravitational lensing offers a method for measuring projected cluster masses which is essentially free from assumptions on the dynamical state of the gravitating matter .",
    "the observed shear is unperturbed by the addition of constant density sheets along the line of sight ( e.g. , gorenstein , shapiro & falco 1988 ) .",
    "furthermore , the relatively small field of view of these observations necessitates a differential determination of the total mass .",
    "this is facilitated by the statistic ( fahlman 1994 ; kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ) @xmath86 which measures the mean dimensionless surface density , @xmath87 , interior to @xmath88 relative to the mean in an annulus @xmath89 , and depends only on the measured galaxy shear estimates , @xmath90 . to convert this to physical units ( e.g. total mass )",
    ", we estimated the angular diameter distances factored into the dimensionless surface density using hdf n+s photometric redshifts ( gwyn & hartwick 1996 , gwyn 1999 ) .    in figure 9 , we present the radial lensing mass profile for clj  0152.7@xmath11357 . the central point for the profile",
    "was chosen to be the point mid - way between the peaks of the x - ray emission ( and the main optical concentrations of the cluster galaxies ) . for comparison purposes , we compute the mass profile for a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , @xmath91 , with the normalization set from the local @xmath92 relation ( holden 2003 ) . for the observed temperature of @xmath93 ,",
    "this yields @xmath94 .",
    "the prediction from this model is shown as the solid line in figure 9 , where we have corrected for the mass in the control annulus , to enable a fair comparison with the lensing results . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the sis model matches the data fairly well .",
    "however , at smaller radii , it tends to overpredict the observed mass profile . in an attempt to improve the model",
    ", we introduced a large core in the density profile , with a softening radius of @xmath96 , similar to the distance from the central point to the peaks of the x - ray emission / optical concentrations of cluster galaxies .",
    "the softened model matches the observations much better at small radii .",
    "mass estimates based on weak lensing techniques are differential , and hence tend to underestimate the total mass . by making a model - dependent assumption on the form of the total mass profile , we can correct for the mass in the control annulus , and extrapolate the mass to some fiducial radius , thus providing an estimate of the mass interior to that radius . in figure 10 , we plot the estimate for the projected mass within @xmath97 , where the correction and extrapolation are calculated from the radii in figure 9 .      to determine the cluster light distribution",
    ", we proceeded as follows : we obtained redshifts for 15 cluster members at _ keck _ in november 1998 .",
    "these galaxies form a tight locus in either a @xmath98 vs. @xmath99 or @xmath98 vs. @xmath100 color - color plot . using the observed colors for",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members as a guide , we identified additional cluster galaxy candidates as those galaxies having similar colors , yielding a catalog containing a total of 210 galaxies .",
    "the measured r - band magnitudes were used to estimate the cluster luminosity as @xmath101}l_{b\\odot},\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the solar absolute b magnitude , @xmath103 is the distance modulus , @xmath104 is the mean color of early type galaxies at @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the k - correction ( coleman , wu & weedman 1980 ) .",
    "we estimated the cluster zero redshift mass - to - light ratio by calculating @xmath107 as the mean projected luminosity density at any radius relative to the mean in the control annulus outside that radius ( where zero redshift mass - to - light ratio means that color of early type galaxies at z=0 were used . ) .",
    "we then estimated @xmath108 , which under the assumption that mass traces light , forms as unbiased estimate of the cluster light distribution ( even if the cluster extends into the control annulus ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 11 .",
    "in the central regions of the clusters where the gas density is high , the icm will lose most of its thermal energy radiatively in a relatively short time in the absence of effective heating sources . by using the best - fit surface brightness profiles for the two clumps of clj  0152.7@xmath11357 , we estimated their cooling time with the following analytic expression @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the so - called gaunt factor .",

    "<S> the x - ray surface brightness profiles of the two clumps can be fitted by either a single @xmath4-model or an nfw - like profile ; the latter giving better fits to the central regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the x - ray derived mass of this cluster is in good agreement with independent lensing measurements . while its appearance indicates that the cluster has not reached a dynamical equilibrium state , its x - ray luminosity @xmath5 , temperature @xmath6 and dynamical mass @xmath7 are consistent with the well - defined @xmath5-@xmath6 and @xmath7-@xmath6 relations for low - redshift galaxy clusters , which suggests that the dynamical properties of the clusters have remained almost unchanged since @xmath8 . </S>"
