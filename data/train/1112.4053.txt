    "@xcite this instability originates from a nonlinear resonant interaction of three waves , and induces an energy transfer from the primary wave towards two secondary waves of lower frequencies .",
    "this instability has received considerable interest in the case of internal gravity waves ,  @xcite because it is believed to provide an efficient mechanism of dissipation in the oceans , by allowing a transfer of energy from the large to the small scales .",
    "@xcite    parametric instability is a generic mechanism expected for any forced oscillator .",
    "a pendulum forced at twice its natural frequency provides a classical illustration of this mechanism . here , the `` parameter '' is the natural frequency of the pendulum , which is modulated in time through variations of the gravity or pendulum length .",
    "weakly nonlinear theory shows that the energy of the excitation , at frequency @xmath0 , is transferred to the pendulum at its natural frequency @xmath1 , resulting in an exponential growth of the oscillation amplitude .    in the case of inertial ( resp .",

    "the brunt - visl frequency @xmath4 ) . in the presence of a primary wave of frequency @xmath0 , this `` parameter '' becomes locally modulated in time at frequency @xmath0 , and is hence able to excite secondary waves of lower natural frequency .",
    "however , here a continuum of frequencies can be excited , so that the frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the secondary waves are not necessarily half the excitation frequency , but they nevertheless have to satisfy the resonant condition @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , in the absence of dissipation , the standard pendulum - like resonance @xmath8 is recovered both for inertial and internal waves , and the corresponding secondary waves have vanishing wavelengths .",
    "@xcite viscosity is responsible here for the lift of degeneracy , by selecting a maximum growth rate corresponding to finite wavelengths , with frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 splitted on both sides of @xmath1 .",

    "@xcite on the other hand , this instability mechanism has received less attention in the case of pure inertial waves ( i.e. , in absence of stratification ) , probably because of the lower importance of rotation effects compared to stratification effects in most geophysical flows . it has been observed in numerical simulations of inertial modes in a periodically compressed rotating cylinder .",
    "@xcite to our knowledge , parametric instability in the simpler geometry of plane inertial waves has not been investigated so far , and is the subject of this paper . a fundamental motivation for this work is the key role played by triadic interactions of inertial waves in the problem of the generation of slow quasi-2d flows in rotating turbulence .",
    "@xcite the parametric subharmonic instability indeed provides a simple but nontrivial mechanism for anisotropic energy transfers from modes of arbitrary wavevectors towards lower frequency modes , of wavevector closer to the plane normal to the rotation axis ( i.e. , more `` horizontal '' by convention ) .",

    "this instability leads to the excitation of two secondary plane waves , with wavevectors which are systematically more `` horizontal '' than the primary wavevector .",
