    "effective field theory ( eft ) descriptions of nuclear interactions are intended to provide model independent predictions of observables using systematic expansions based on a separation of scales@xcite . in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) ( the low energy effective field theory for hadronic interactions arising from qcd )",
    "this is accomplished by implementing a power counting scheme which treats pionic effects explicitly , while heavier mesons are integrated out leaving their effects to be summarized in short distance parameters @xcite .",
    "unlike the cases arising in hadronic physics , the application of @xmath7pt to nuclear problems is not straightforward , as light scales exist in the problem ( such as the scattering lengths ) which are formally small from the perspective of @xmath7pt , but are in fact unnaturally large .",
    "the original scheme proposed by weinberg@xcite to deal with the unnatural scales implements power counting at the level of the lagrangian , and then solves the full schrdinger equation , effectively iterating the interaction to all orders .",
    "this scheme , also known as @xmath8 counting , has enjoyed many phenomenological successes @xcite . however , due to the nonperturbative nature of this approach , there is no systematic power counting at the level of the amplitudes and observables .    during the past two years",
    ", there has been considerable interest in a new way to implement eft for systems of interacting nucleons originally developed by kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw)@xcite . the essence of this scheme is to count powers of a low mass scale which is denoted by @xmath0 , with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nn scattering length , and @xmath11 is the relative momentum of the nucleon .",
    "this @xmath0 counting scheme is based on an expansion of @xmath12 , where @xmath8 is a mass scale characteristic of the short distance physics . since @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath11",
    "are formally of the same order the scheme includes @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 to all orders .",
    "the scheme requires that the lowest order nn contact interaction be iterated to all orders building in the large scattering lengths .",
    "all other interactions including all pionic interactions are treated perturbatively .",
    "this scheme has been used to calculate numerous observables at next to leading order ( nlo ) with at least modest success @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the scheme is its rigorous power counting at the level of observables which allows for the _ a priori _ estimate of the theoretical uncertainties in any regime where the @xmath0 expansion is converging .",
    "this ability to estimate higher order corrections is one of the principal motivations for doing calculations with effective field theory , rather than with potential models .",
    "it is also possible to develop an eft where the pion is integrated out as heavy .",
    "this pion - integrated - out theory is essentially equivalent to zero range pseudo - potential theory@xcite .",
    "it contains an analog of @xmath0 counting where the light scales are @xmath11 and @xmath14 only . to avoid confusion",
    ", we will use the phrase , `` @xmath0 counting , '' to refer to the full theory including explicit pions unless we explicitly indicate otherwise or it is clear from the context that we mean the pion integrated out case .",
    "apart from the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing angle , @xmath6 , which is examined in this paper , calculations done with the pions - integrated - out eft are often of comparable quality to calculations done to the same order in a theory with explicit pions@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , for observables related to @xmath18-wave nn scattering , the pion - integrated - out theory fares significantly better than the theory with pions explicitly included at momentum less than @xmath19mev , even though the @xmath20 expansion has a radius of convergence limited by a cut at @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the fact that the pions - integrated - out theory often does as well , or better than the theory with explicit pions raises questions about the convergence of the chiral part of the @xmath0 expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the part based on the expansion @xmath22@xcite . the possible problems with the chiral @xmath0 expansion are particularly clear when one examines predictions for observables which are chirally sensitive , in the sense that they are dominated by pion exchange physics .",
    "those observables which vanish at some order in the @xmath0 counting expansion for the pion - integrated - out theory but which are finite at the same order in the theory with explicit pions form an obvious class of chirally sensitive observables .",
    "an example of such a chirally sensitive quantity is the `` shape function '' , @xmath23 , introduced in ref .",
    "it is defined as @xmath24 so that it removes the first two terms from the effective range expansion and leaves the rest . in @xmath0 counting at nlo there are two free parameters in s wave scattering which fix @xmath10 and @xmath25 .",
    "the shape function removes sensitivity to the fit parameters by subtracting off the first two terms in the effective range expansion . in @xmath0-counting with explicit pions ,",
    "@xmath23 is order @xmath26 due to the pion exchange contributions ; formally this can be seen in the inclusion of @xmath17 to all orders .",
    "in contrast , @xmath23 is order @xmath27 in the pion - integrated - out theory .",
    "thus , in a regime where @xmath0 counting is valid , @xmath23 is highly sensitive to the pion dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath0 counting fails to predict even the sign of @xmath23 at momenta @xmath28 .",
    "the failure of the theory to describe @xmath23 at nlo suggests that the chiral expansion part of the @xmath0 counting may not be working well .",
    "the conjecture that the chiral part of @xmath0 counting is converging poorly has been supported by recent calculations by kaplan and steele@xcite using a toy potential including explicit one - pion - exchange with a realistic scattering length and effective range . in this model ,",
    "s - wave scattering shows no sign of convergence at nnlo . of course , the model studied was only a toy including only a one - pion - exchange potential .",
    "it is logically possible that higher - order calculations for the realistic nuclear scattering problem which includes non - potential ( `` radiation pion '' ) effects@xcite will behave differently .",
    "it is important to check the convergence of the chiral part of @xmath0 counting .",
    "ideally one should check convergence by doing higher - order calculations for the realistic problem including radiation pion effects .",
    "unfortunately , at present a full nnlo calculation for s - wave scattering has not been published .",
    "however , the s - d mixing parameter ( which involves the s - wave function at only nlo ) has been calculated at nnlo by fleming , mehan and stewart ( fms ) @xcite including all radiation pion effects .",
    "the s - d mixing parameter should also be a good place to study the chiral part of @xmath0 counting as it is chirally sensitive in the sense defined above : it is zero at nlo in @xmath0 counting for a theory with pions integrated out and nonzero in a theory with explicit pions .",
    "fms find extremely good agreement between the nnlo calculation for the usual s - d mixing parameter , @xmath29@xcite , and the @xmath6 extracted from the data ( using the nijmegen partial wave analysis ( pwa)@xcite ) for relative momenta up to 150 mev .",
    ", and the mixing parameter in a different parameterization@xcite is called @xmath6 ] they conclude that this gives phenomenological support for the use of perturbative pions as is done in @xmath0 counting .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dependence of @xmath6 at nnlo on the choice of the renormalization condition ( _ i.e. _ , the method used to fit the one undetermined low energy constant ) . the variations in @xmath6 resulting from different fits are found to be very large ; the variations are of order 100% at @xmath11 of 100 mev despite the fact that such variations only emerge at order @xmath31 .",
    "this sensitivity is a result of cancelations between terms entering at nnlo which are much larger than the total value of @xmath6 by typically an order of magnitude or more at momenta above 50 mev .",
    "moreover one of the large and canceling terms is proportional to a free parameter and thus is entirely determined by the fit .",
    "this strongly indicates that the large dependence upon the renormalization condition is a direct consequence of the lack of predictive power at this order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "in this section the nnlo calculation of @xmath6 done by fleming , mehan , and stewart @xcite is discussed briefly and relevant formulae are presented .",
    "the pds scheme of ksw@xcite is a renormalization scheme in which the @xmath0-counting is manifest .",
    "the starting point is the effective lagrangian : @xmath32   & & -{c_2^{(sd ) } } { \\cal o}_2^{(sd ) } + \\ldots \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the pion decay constant ( approximately 132 mev in this normalization ) , @xmath34 is related to the quark condensate and @xmath33 , @xmath35 is related to the pion fields in the usual fashion in chiral perturbation theory , and the @xmath36 are nucleon contact interactions .",
    "the first step is to sum all graphs containing only the contact interaction coupling @xmath37 to all orders which has the effect of accommodating the unnaturally long scattering length present in nn scattering . as a result",
    ", the product @xmath38 is kept to all orders as required in @xmath0 counting .",
    "the integral is divergent and is regulated using dimensional regularization with pds .",
    "the resulting amplitude is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "all other interactions are included perturbatively",

    "in essence , the fits of @xmath67 are the renormalization conditions relating the parameters in the theory to physical quantities . in principle",
    ", one has a certain amount of freedom in choosing precisely which physical quantity is fit .",
    "of course , to the extent the @xmath0 expansion is well converged to the correct result , one expects that the dependence of the final prediction on the particular choice of renormalization condition ( _ i.e. _ , the particular quantity to which one fits ) will be confined to higher - order terms which are numerically small .",
    "thus , one way to test the sensitivity to higher order terms is by testing the sensitivity to imposing different renormalization conditions .",
    "as noted above , @xmath68 can be fit from @xmath18 wave scattering data at nlo .",
    "thus , the nnlo calculation of @xmath6 depends on a single free parameter @xmath60 associated with the s - d mixing counterterm .",
    "the method used in @xcite to fit @xmath60 is via a global fit to the nijmegen partial wave analysis of the scattering data , weighted towards low momenta ; this results in @xmath69 .",

    "we exploit the fact that there is only one free parameter at this order .",
    "thus any fitting procedure must be equivalent to fixing the predicted value of the mixing angle at some particular fixed value of momentum .",
    "for example , although the fit of fms was a weighted global fit , the predictions would have been the same had the renormalization condition for @xmath60 been that the nnlo prediction for @xmath6 agree with the nijmegen pwa value at a momentum of approximately @xmath71 mev . thus an efficient way to explore different valid choices for renormalization conditions",
    "is to construct fits which ensure that the theory agrees with the data at different fixed choices of momentum @xmath72 .",
    "assuming even modest convergence of the @xmath0 expansion ( @xmath73mev ) , it should be reasonable to fit @xmath60 at any @xmath74 mev as we are working at nnlo . by varying @xmath72 from @xmath75mev , a continuous set of presumably valid renormalization conditions",
    "is obtained which can be used to estimate the size of theoretical uncertainties present at this order due to higher - order terms . in this manner ,",
    "the range resulting from the variation of the @xmath76 can be used as a gauge for the predictive power of the theory .",
    "the results of this variation are displayed in fig .",
    "[ graph1 ] .",
    "figure [ graph1 ] is an indication that the @xmath0 expansion is not very predictive at this order .",
    "by @xmath5 mev , @xmath77 differences are present between the fits at @xmath78 mev and @xmath79 mev .",
    "by @xmath79 mev the differences reach @xmath80 .",
    "the great sensitivity to the choice of renormalization condition casts doubt on the usefulness of perturbative pions at least for this quantity at this order .",
    "another indication of a general problem with the approach is the overall shape of the curve .",
    "it is easy to see that for all @xmath81 , the eft prediction overshoots the data as it climbs essentially quadratically , failing entirely to predict the slow linear ascent of the data .",
    "the difficulty in reproducing the detailed shape is not immediately apparent in the work of fms . by considering only comparatively small momenta ( 150 mev or less ) and choosing a relatively high renormalization condition ,",
    "@xmath82 mev , fms have left very little room for this serious problem to manifest itself .",
    "note , however , it is inconsistent with the power counting rules of @xmath0 counting to restrict @xmath72 to momenta below 150 mev .",
    "the counting rules were derived for @xmath83 .",
    "it is extremely implausible that momenta just above 150 mev can not be considered of order @xmath13 .",
    "the great sensitivity to the choice of renormalization condition is in some sense paradoxical .",
    "the values of @xmath60 for our fits which cross the data vary only from .359 ( for @xmath84 of 20 mev ) to .412 ( for @xmath84 of 200 mev ) .",
    "the apparent paradox is in explaining how such modest variations in the fit parameter can yield such large variations in the predicted values .",
    "this is particularly hard to understand in light of the fact that the contribution due to @xmath60 is subleading and should have modest effects to the total , regardless of its value .",
    "the resolution is both quite simple and very troubling : there are cancelations between terms entering at nnlo which are much larger than the total value @xmath6 itself .",
    "these cancelations can be seen by breaking the nnlo contribution , @xmath85 , into two pieces : the term proportional to @xmath60 , which we denote by @xmath86 , where the subscript ct indicates counterterm , and the remaining piece which we will denote as @xmath87 .",
    "the expression @xmath86 is : @xmath88 the expression for @xmath87 can be extracted from eqs .",
    "( [ eps2]),([chi ] ) , and ( [ asd1 ] ) with @xmath60 set equal to zero .    in fig .",
    "[ graph2 ] we show the @xmath6 mixing angle extracted from the nijmegen pwa , along with the nlo prediction , the full nnlo calculation of @xmath6 ( with @xmath60 fixed using @xmath89 mev ) , and the two terms which enter at nnlo@xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath87 term and the @xmath86 term are typically more than an order of magnitude larger than the prediction at nlo , the prediction at nnlo , and the result extracted from scattering data .",
    "both of these terms are much larger than the leading order terms suggesting serious problems with convergence .",
    "perhaps more seriously , they are much larger than the overall scale of the final result .",
    "note that formally both of these terms are subleading and should each separately give modest corrections to the nlo result .",
    "instead , each swamps the nlo , and our prediction depends on delicate cancelations between the nnlo terms .",
    "the great sensitivity to the choice of renormalization condition is a result of this requirement of very large cancelations .",
    "rather slight changes in the momentum where one fits translate into rather large changes in the sum .",
    "the large scale of the cancelations at nnlo suggest that there is no real predictive power at this order .",
    "the individual quantities which cancel should have corrections of relative order @xmath12 due to higher - order contributions ; such corrections can easily be @xmath90 .",
    "since these terms are required to cancel by more than an order of magnitude to reach the data , @xmath91 uncertainties in each term translate to @xmath92 uncertainties for the total .",
    "thus , there appears to be no predictive power at this order . indeed",
    ", this analysis based on the cancelations suggests that lack of predictive power is more severe than one might have concluded on the basis of the sensitivity to the renormalization condition found in the previous section .",
    "one practical consquence of the large cancelations at nnlo and the resultant great sensitivity to the value of the parameters is evident in the calculation seen in fig .",
    "( [ fmsfig ] ) . using the parameters quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite we produced a plot which differed from the plot in ref .",
    "@xcite by a perceptable amount .",
    "we believe this small difference was a consquence of extremely small rounding errors whose effects were magnified . by adjusting the @xmath60 parameter down from .385 to .3835",
    "we were able to qualitatively reproduce their result .",
    "of course , it is logically possible that the large cancelation seen at nnlo is an artifact of the way the nnlo contribution was divided into two terms .",
    "one can always divide a small number into the difference of two unnaturally large numbers ; in doing this one can only conclude that there is something wrong with the way the contribution was divided , and not that there is any problem with underlying theory .",
    "however , in the present context this appears to be quite unlikely _ a priori_. the division into these two terms was not chosen to maximize their individual size , but rather to see the size of the counterterm contribution ( which by standard power counting arguments contributes at nnlo and should have the characteristic size of a typical nnlo contribution ) .",
    "ultimately what we see is that the scale of the nnlo contribution is much larger than the full result and one is depending entirely on the fitting @xmath60 to force the result to be at more or less the right size .    as noted above , it is surprising that the sensitivity of the nnlo prediction of @xmath6 to the choice of renormalization condition , although large , is as small as it is given the very large cancelations at nnlo .",
    "this can be understood , in part , in terms of the detailed shapes of the two terms at nnlo .",
    "both the @xmath86 and @xmath93 terms are cubic in @xmath11 for low @xmath11 , and essentially quadratic for @xmath94 mev .",
    "thus the shapes are rather similar ; if they largely cancel at one momentum they will continue to largely cancel at other momenta .",
    "this tends to moderate the sensitivity to the choice of renormalization condition .",
    "the @xmath6 extracted from the scattering data is also cubic in @xmath11 at very low momenta , and with one free parameter , it is not surprising that the theory fares moderately well in this regime .",
    "however , when fits are performed at @xmath95 mev , the quality of the fits worsen dramatically - a result of trying to fit an essentially quadratic function to a linear one . as the momentum increases , this quadratic function dominates since the cancelation between @xmath86 and @xmath93 is not perfect .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the theory is simply not predictive above @xmath5 mev .",
    "it is amusing to note that at extremely low momenta @xmath96 mev , all of the fits done with @xmath76 as large as 200 mev seem to converge to a cubic with approximately the same coefficient at low momentum .",
    "given the fact that theory does not appear to be predictive at 200 mev , we are forced to conclude that this is fortutitous .",
    "in the introduction we raised the question of whether the chiral part of @xmath0 counting was converging well . in this paper",
    "we have seen that @xmath6 at nnlo does not appear to be predictive and hence does not support the assertion that perturbative pions are useful .",
    "it is useful , however , to explore the question of whether one would expect the @xmath0 counting expansion to be predictive at this order .",
    "in fact , even if @xmath0 counting were converging one might have suspected on the basis of simple power counting arguments that the s - d mixing angle would not be predictive at nnlo without actually doing the calculation .",
    "the leading nonvanishing order contribution to @xmath6 is order @xmath65 . to estimate",
    "the expected size of @xmath6 one needs a characteristic value of @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is not immediately clear what values one should take for @xmath0 or @xmath8 .",
    "it is probably sensible to consider @xmath6 at a momentum of @xmath97 so that one can take @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 mev as suggested by kaplan , savage and wise @xcite the power counting estimate for @xmath6 is @xmath100 , which is more than an order magnitude larger than the observed value of @xmath101 .",
    "assuming that the @xmath0 expansion is sensible , this suggests that @xmath6 is itself a result of large accidental cancelations . as an unnaturally small observable , theoretical difficulties are to be expected , and expansions of @xmath6 are expected to converge very slowly if at all .",
    "for example , corrections to the nnlo are nominally @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath102 which is three times the observed value , indicating a complete lack of predictive power at this order .",
    "if @xmath0 counting is in fact converging , but @xmath6 is just accidently small , one can estimate to what order one must work in order to get an accurate prediction .",
    "if one insists on an accuracy of @xmath103 , one estimates contributions at their nominal order and @xmath8 is taken to be 300 mev , then one has to work to order @xmath104 , this corresponds to next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to - next - to leading order .",
    "thus , even if the theory is converging as well as could be expected for @xmath105 300 mev , it is implausible that such calculations will ever prove tractable .",
    "of course if @xmath8 is larger , one need not work to quite as high an order . nevertheless , if @xmath106 one needs to work to order @xmath107 which also seems to be intractable .",
    "naively it seemed that the s - d mixing parameter , @xmath6 , should be a good place to test the chiral part of the @xmath0 expansion , as it is chirally sensitive in the sense defined in the introduction .",
    "however , the unnaturally small size of the mixing vitiates its utility as a strong test of perturbative pions .",
    "we do note , though , that the very fact that the mixing is unnatural in itself does cast some doubt on the use of perturbative pions in general , as unnatural results are , by definition , unexpected if the scales in the problem are properly identified .    in summary , we find that calculations of @xmath6 at nnlo do not appear to be predictive as they are highly dependent on the fitting procedure used ( _ i.e. _ , on the renormalization condition ) and the fitting involves delicate cancelations of quantities much larger than the total value .",
    "we argue that this lack of predictive power is consistent with simple power counting estimates given the small size of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we find that calculations of @xmath6 to this order do not provide evidence for the use of perturbative pions .        c. ordonez and u. van kolck , _ phys .",
