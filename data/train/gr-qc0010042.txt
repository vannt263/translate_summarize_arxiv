    "quantum field theory(qft ) requires the notion of a time - like killing vector field to define particles . in minkowski space - time existence of a global time - like killing vector ,",
    "invariant under lorentz transformation , allows us to identify a preferred vacuum state for the theory .",
    "even in flat space - time , when curvilinear coordinate transformations are allowed there arises other possible killing vector fields which are time - like in part of the manifold .",
    "particle states  in particular vacuum state  can be defined using these killing vector fields . in general",
    ", these definitions will not be equivalent and the minkowski vacuum will appear to be a many particle state according to the new definition .",
    "for example , the vacuum state of the minkowski observer appears to be a thermal state in the uniformly accelerated frame with a temperature given by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the constant acceleration ) .    in a general curved space - time",
    ", we may not have any time - like killing vector field and hence it is not always possible to identify a preferred set of positive frequency modes .",
    "in static space - times , which have a time - like killing vector , it is possible to define positive frequency modes . however in these space - times , there could arise more than one time - like killing vector field making the quantization in different coordinates ( describing the same gravitational background ) inequivalent . hence",
    ", the concept of a particle is not generally covariant in curved space - times .",
    "a spectacular prediction of quantum field theory in curved space - time is the hawking radiation from a black hole .",
    "hawking@xcite showed that qft in the background of a body collapsing to a black hole , of mass @xmath2 , will lead , at late times , to a radiation of particles in all modes of the quantum field , with characteristic thermal spectrum at a temperature equal to @xmath3 .",
    "it is generally believed that the pair production occurring near the horizon in the case of black holes is  real \" with the mass of the black hole being converted into energy of the emitted particles .",
    "but as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs , the concept of a particle in quantum field theory is not generally covariant and depends on the coordinates chosen to describe the particular space - time .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study the hawking effect in other coordinate representations . the original method used by hawking",
    "is closely tied to the standard schwarzschild coordinate . hawking s calculation of the particle creation amplitudes ( and bogolubov coefficients )",
    "requires the knowledge of the wave modes of the quantum field in the standard schwarzschild coordinate .",
    "the solutions of the wave equation in the schwarzschild coordinate system can not be written down in terms of simple functions and hence , the calculation of bogolubov coefficients to identify the spectrum of radiation becomes intractable .",
    "hence , it is necessary to have a method which does not use wave modes to calculate the emission spectrum .",
    "hartle and hawking  @xcite obtained particle production in the standard black hole space - times using a semiclassical analysis which does not require the knowledge of the wave modes . in this method ,",
    "the semiclassical propagator for a scalar field propagating in the maximally extended kruskal manifold is analytically continued in the time variable @xmath4 to complex values .",
    "this analytic continuation gives the result that the probability of emission of particles from the past horizon is not the same as the probability of absorption into the future horizon .",
    "the ratio between these probabilities is of the form p [ ] = p [ ] e^-e [ eqn : thermalsys ] , where @xmath5 is the energy of the particles and @xmath6 is the standard hawking temperature .",
    "the above relation is interpreted to be equivalent to a thermal distribution of particles in analogy with that observed in any system interacting with black body radiation . in this analysis ,",
    "the probability amplitude for the emission / absorption is calculated by identifying a particular path for both these processes in the fully extended kruskal manifold .",
    "unfortunately , the kruskal extension plays a vital role in obtaining the thermal spectrum in this analysis , and hence , it can not be adapted to other coordinate systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have obtained hawking radiation _ without using the kruskal extension_. they have shown that the coordinate singularity present at the horizon , in the standard schwarzschild coordinate , manifests itself as a singularity in the expression for the classical action @xmath7 which occurs in the semiclassical propagator @xmath8 , which is given by k(r_2 , t_2 ; r_1 , t_1 ) = n (s_0(r_2 , t_2 ; r_1 , t_1 ) ) .",
    "@xmath7 is the action functional satisfying the classical hamilton jacobi ( hj ) equation for a massless particle to propagate from @xmath9 to @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the suitable normalization constant .",
    "the authors used the method of complex paths discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is used to describe tunneling processes in non - relativistic semi - classical quantum mechanics .",
    "the method of complex paths used in ordinary quantum mechanics was modified appropriately to produce a prescription that regularizes the singularity in the action functional and hawking radiation was recovered as a consequence .",
    "this method also provides a heuristic picture of hawking radiation as tunneling . in this method , by construction , the _ in _ modes of the field is in the vacuum state and the tunneling process near the horizon produces a steady out - flux of radiation .",
    "the authors consider unruh vacuum to define particles at future infinity .",
    "( see for example , refs .",

    "we apply the method of complex paths to two non - static coordinate systems of the schwarzschild space - time and obtain hawking radiation .",
    "the two coordinate systems we consider are : lemaitre coordinate ( a time dependent system ) and coordinate ( a stationary  but not a static  system ) .",
    "the lemaitre coordinate being a time dependent system , suggests that there could be a genuine particle production .",
    "hence , it is interesting to know what kind of particle spectrum is seen in this coordinate system . in the case of coordinate , a priori it",
    "not clear whether there exists a genuine particle production !",
    "also there has been a growing interest in the semiclassical treatment of hawking radiation in the metric ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) in relation with the hydrodynamic analog models of event horizon .",
    "the hydrodynamic analog of an event horizon was suggested by unruh  @xcite as a more accessible phenomenon which might shed some light on the hawking effect and , in particular , on the role of ultra - high frequencies  @xcite .",
    "an event horizon for the sound waves appears in principle wherever there is a closed surface through which a fluid flows inwards at the speed of sound , the flow being subsonic on one side of the surface and supersonic on the other .",
    "there is a close analogy between sound propagation on a background hydrodynamic flow , and field propagation on a background in a curved space - time . determining whether and how sonic black holes radiate sound , in a full calculation beyond the hydrodynamic approximation or in an actual experiment , can thus offer some suggestions about black - hole radiance and its sensitivity to ultra - high frequency physics .",
    "it is seen that for an irrotational fluid with constant density and sound speed with the fluid velocity @xmath12 , then one can obtain a metric element which is conformal to form of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "the acoustic horizon of this kind are of interest in understanding the role of ultra - high frequencies in the hawking radiation .    in these two coordinate representations , and lemaitre",
    ", metric has no coordinate singularity at the horizon .",
    "we notice that the action function for a classical particle in both these coordinates acquires a singularity at the horizon . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that it is only the singularities that appear in the action that contribute to particle production . for the lemaitre coordinate ,",
    "the regularization of the singularity in action is achieved and the hawking radiation is recovered without reference to the time dependent nature of the system .",
    "the same feature is seen even in the stationary system where the singularity represented by the horizon appears as a pole in the expression for the action and upon regularization by a suitable prescription gives hawking radiation . the temperature associated with the radiation for both the coordinate representations is same as that obtained in the standard schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "we would like to note the following : even - though the action satisfies a generally covariant hj equation , when one transforms coordinates , the action integral develops poles and this need to be interpreted . in the case of kruskal",
    "coordinate , which is the maximal extension of schwarzschild space - time , it is easy to show that the semiclassical action when expressed in terms of kruskal coordinates does not contain the singularity . [ the hj equation ( of a massless particle ) when expressed in terms of the kruskal coordinates @xmath13 is of the form @xmath14 ( for s - wave i.e @xmath15 ) .",
    "the solution of the equation can be easily obtained and is given by @xmath16 . ]    to our knowledge , the semi - classical treatment of hawking radiation for the lemaitre coordinate has not been performed in the literature .",
    "the semi - classical treatment of hawking radiation for the metric is obtained recently by parikh and wilczek  @xcite .",
    "the authors considered hawking radiation as a pair creation outside the horizon , with the negative energy particle tunneling into the black hole .",
    "they have not considered the contribution of the tunneling of a particle from inside the horizon to outside the horizon to describe the hawking radiation .",
    "our approach is quite different and could be of more general validity .    before proceeding to the technical aspects ,",
    "it is necessary to outline certain conceptual issues regarding the emission spectrum from the black hole in different coordinate systems .",
    "the wave modes obtained using semiclassical techniques , in general , are the exact modes of the quantum system in the asymptotic regions . thus",
    ", if the asymptotic structure of the space - time is different for any two coordinates , then the semiclassical wave modes associated with these two coordinate systems will themselves be different .",
    "hence , the spectrum of the radiation emitted , if any , in these two coordinates , with different asymptotic structure , will be completely different .",
    "the lemaitre coordinate can be modeled as that natural to a freely falling observer whose velocity at radial infinity is zero [ for more discussion see sec .",
    "( [ subsec : lemaitre ] ) ] . in the asymptotic past and future , the structure of these two coordinate systems are similar ; suggesting that the asymptotic wave modes must be the same . in sec .",
    "( [ sec : semiclas ] ) , we have shown that the spectrum of the particles emitted in the two coordinates , and lemaitre , is a thermal spectrum  same as in standard schwarzschild .",
    "even though , the two coordinate systems , and lemaitre , possess no singularities at the horizon , the action function for a classical particle acquires singularity at the horizon .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that the contribution to the thermal radiation of the emitted particles is from the singularities .",
    "thus , it suggests that the temperature associated with the thermal spectrum in these two coordinate systems , and lemaitre , should be the same as that of the standard hawking temperature .",
    "the metric corresponding to the standard schwarzschild coordinate is time reversal invariant , @xmath17 .",
    "however , the metric corresponding to the two coordinates , and lemaitre , are not time reversal invariant .",
    "the time reversal transformation in these cases correspond to a different physical situation .",
    "however , the line elements corresponding to these different physical situations are related to the standard schwarzschild by a coordinate transformation [ see sec .",
    "( [ sec : coor ] ) for more details ] .",
    "the space - time structure of these two coordinates , lemaitre and , are best analyzed using r and t regions introduced by novikov  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the space - time structure of the two coordinates , and lemaitre , using r and t regions provides an elegant method in understanding the global structure of the space - time , thus making the detailed analysis of particle trajectories unnecessary . using this analysis",
    ", we show that the part / whole of the lemaitre / manifold is doubly mapped _",
    "w.r.t _ the standard schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we find that the complex paths we use in our analysis , takes into account of all possible paths satisfying the semiclassical ansatz  irrespective of he multiple mapping of the part / whole of the space - time .",
    "the above statement can be better appreciated in the language of path - integrals .",
    "the feynman propagator @xmath18 for a scalar field , of mass @xmath19 , propagating in a background metric @xmath20 can be written in two equivalent forms as g_f(x , y|g ) & = & _ paths ( -m ( x , y ) ) + & = & _ 0^ d(-m^2 ) x (- _ 0^g_ik ^i ^k d ) where @xmath21 is the measure of the path . in the first form",
    ", @xmath22 is the proper length of a path connecting the events @xmath23 and @xmath24 , calculated with the background metric @xmath20 and the sum is over all paths .",
    "it is also possible to show that the result is equivalent to the second expression . in the case of space - times where there are no multiple mappings",
    "then the measure ( of all sets ) of paths will be the same .",
    "however , in the space - times where part / whole of the manifold is multiply mapped , the measure of certain sets of paths will be different from certain other sets of paths .",
    "hence , it is necessary to do a global analysis of the background space - time to identify the measure of the paths .",
    "similarly , in the method of complex paths , the family of paths we use to calculate the emission and absorption probability takes into account of all paths irrespective of the multiple mapping of the part / whole of the space - time .",
    "these facts will have bearing on the interpretation of temperature as explained in sec .",
    "( [ sec : semiclas ] ) .",
    "our result is of physical significance for the following reason : it is normally assumed that the evaporation process results from an instability of the vacuum in the presence of background metric .",
    "the particles are produced at a constant rate suggesting that the hawking radiation converts the mass of the black hole into energy , thereby decreasing the mass .",
    "the decrease in the black hole mass is a physical effect and should be independent of the coordinate transformations and hence _ hawking radiation should be covariant_. here we show that this is indeed true by the method of complex paths as far as these coordinates are concerned .    before concluding this section",
    ", we would like to stress the following point : there is no correspondence between the particles detected by a detector ( which is coupled to a quantum field @xmath25 ) and the particle spectrum obtained by the field theoretic analysis .",
    "this result is known in the context of flat space - times .",
    "for example , in the case of uniformly rotating detector , the expectation value of the rotational number operator in the minkowski space - time is zero whereas the response of a uniformly rotating unruh - dewitt detector is non - zero ( for more examples see , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of classical gravitational backgrounds",
    ", defining particles using the particle detectors is non - trivial .",
    "the trouble in defining the particle detectors is that the inertial detectors become free falling detectors and in general no two free falling observers will agree on a choice of vacuum . only in exceptional cases in high symmetry will a set of detector exist that all register no particles , and this set may not even be free falling .",
    "these facts will have important implications in comparing the results of a freely falling detector in the schwarzschild space - time @xcite to that of the particle spectrum we obtain for the lemaitre coordinates in sec .",

    "but if the points are located on opposite sides of the horizon then the integral does not exist due to the divergence of @xmath60 at @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the probability amplitude for crossing the horizon we have to give an extra prescription for evaluating the integral @xcite .",
    "since the horizon defined by @xmath61 is null we may carry out the calculation in euclidean space or equivalently  use an appropriate @xmath62 prescription to specify the complex contour over which the integral has to be performed around @xmath37 .",
