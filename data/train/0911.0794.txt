    "the electronic fpi , discussed in some detail first by chamon et al .",
    "@xcite , was realized in a form of a hall bar perturbed along the current flow by two constrictions ; each formed by a biased split - gate quantum point contact ( qpc ) , with a plunger gate that controlled the area of the fpi ( shown in fig .",
    "current flows chirally in the form of distinct edge channels , with the lower right - moving channel biased ( at voltage ) relative to the upper left - moving one ( kept at    [ fig : setup ]    ground potential ) .",
    "when the bulk is in a qhe state , the two - terminal conductance , in the absence of the constrictions , is quantized at @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the filling factor , where @xmath2 is the areal electron density , @xmath3 the flux quantum , @xmath4 the electron charge , @xmath5 the planck constant , and @xmath6 the magnetic field .",
    "each constriction induces backscattering from a forward propagating edge channel to a backward moving one .",
    "circulating edge currents in the fpi acquire a phase determined by the ab effect ( proportional to the enclosed magnetic flux ) and the number of enclosed quasiparticles .",
    "the ab phase can be controlled by either changing the magnetic field or the area of the interferometer ( via biasing the plunger gate ) .",
    "our interferometers were fabricated on heterostructures embedding 2deg with a few different areal electron densities , @xmath75.6@xmath810@xmath9@xmath10 , 8.6@xmath810@xmath9@xmath10 and 2.0@xmath810@xmath11@xmath10 , all having low temperature mobility in excess of 10@xmath810@xmath12@xmath13v - s .",
    "measurements were done on two different sizes fpis , one with an area @xmath144.4@xmath15m@xmath16 and one with an area @xmath1417.6@xmath17m@xmath16 , with plunger gate width @xmath18 . here",
    "we present data mainly taken with the smaller fpi ( unless otherwise specified ) , fabricated on the wafer with electron density 8.6@xmath810@xmath9@xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "samples were cooled in a dilution refrigerator to an electron temperature @xmath1410mk ( verified by temperature sensitive shot noise measurements ) with conductance measurements taken at a typical excitation voltage of about 1@xmath15vp - p at 800khz .",
    "the parameters of the system are as follows : the area of the interferometer , @xmath19 ; the magnetic field , @xmath6 ; the qpcs split - gate voltages ,  and ; the plunger gate voltage , ; the bias on the source , ; the electron temperature , @xmath20 ; and in some devices the voltage applied to a top - gate , .",
    "the cell of the fpi , is defined by depleting the electrons underneath the metallic gates that surrounds it while assuring that the two constrictions stay open .",
    "then , the magnetic field is tuned to the approximate center of a conductance plateau ; with the filling factor in the fpi cell similar to that in the bulk ( verified by multi - terminal hall measurements across the interferometer ) .",
    "the constrictions are then being carefully pinched ( via the split - gate voltages ,  & ) , resulting in transmissions of the interfering edge channel @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "we denote the number of fully reflected edge channels , belonging to the highest landau levels , being also the number of circulating edge channels within the fpi cell , by , and the number of fully transmitted edge channels , belonging to the lowest landau levels , by .",
    "together with the interfering channel the total number of channels is = + 1 + ; being determined by the bulk filling factor @xmath23 ( for iqhe , = @xmath23 ) .",
    "we notate each configuration as ( @xmath23 , ) @xmath24(bulk filling factor , number of fully transmitted edge channels ) .",
    "the two terminal differential conductance @xmath25 was measured as function of various parameters , @xmath26 , from which the periodicities of the ab oscillations were extracted , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 .",
    "we selected to present here only a subset of our results , which , however , portray a rather complete picture of the behavior of the fpi .",
    "in the iqhe regime , interference was measured for all possible configurations ( @xmath23 , ) , with = @xmath30 and @xmath31 through 6 and at different settings of transmissions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "as expected , for @xmath21 , @xmath32 ( weak coupling to the leads ) multiple reflected trajectories within the fpi interfered , and the two terminal conductance peaked sharply as function of flux ; while at high transmissions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the conductance was almost sinusoidal as function of flux .",
    "however , and this is important to note , the periodicities of the interference were independent of the transmissions .",
    "we start with @xmath33 , namely , a single propagating edge channel ( the spin resolved first landau level ) , with an oscillating conductance as function of , with periodicity @xmath342.35mv ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : b_indep ]    remarkably , the conductance in this case ( and universally for all cases of = 0 ) was found to be independent of magnetic field for many added flux quanta ( the magnetic field corresponding to one flux quantum threading 4.4@xmath15m@xmath16 is @xmath149.8gauss ) .",
    "so here we had an extraordinary situation where ab oscillations were responsive to a change in area but not to a change in the threading magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , profound oscillations as function of both @xmath6 and  were always observed for @xmath350 , with a typical behavior for case @xmath36 shown in fig .",
    "3 . the periodicity with  was found to depend only on  ( in both , the iqhe and fqhe regimes ) , increasing when  increased .",
    "unexpectedly , the slope of the constant phase lines in the @xmath6-  plane is counter intuitive : _ an increase _ in @xmath6 _ must be accompanied by an increase _ in  in order to keep the phase constant ( as was also observed in ref .",
    "this suggests that an increase in @xmath6 leads to a decrease of the enclosed flux - an opposite behavior to that observed before in the electronic mzi @xcite .",
    "an exception to this behavior , observed in our large fpi , will be discussed separately . in the example in fig .",
    "3a [ case @xmath36 ] , the dependence of the transmission on @xmath6 and on  was sinusoidal for large @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; becoming an array of periodic sharp peaks when the constrictions were pinched ( fig .",
    "3b ) , however , the periodicities did not change .",
    "[ fig : t_indep ]    similar conductance oscillations were observed as function of a voltage  applied to an added small top - gate ( @xmath38 ) in the center of the fpi cell , with area @xmath140.75@xmath15m@xmath16 and circumference @xmath143@xmath15 m ( see fig .",
    "again , the periodicities in  for @xmath33 and @xmath39 , are identical - as summarized in fig .",
    "4b . for @xmath35 - 135mv , the area under the top - gate is being only partly depleted , and the periodicity observed is @xmath40@xmath140.23mv .",
    "a trivial two - plate capacitor model , with @xmath410.66ff calculated for our specific device , suggests an expulsion of one electron in a single period . for @xmath42 - 135mv ,",
    "the 2deg under the top - gate is fully depleted and the depletion region extends away from the top - gate .",
    "the capacitance of the top - gate to the 2deg slowly increased with gate voltage , starting at a periodicity of 0.23mv and increasing to @xmath140.6mv .",
    "the periodicity measured with a plunger gate for the = 0 cases if about 2.3mv . dividing it by the ratio between the top - gate length and its own ( @xmath140.4@xmath15m@xmath16 ) gives about 0.30mv .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath40  measured at beyond depletion voltages .",
    "a rather interesting behavior is observed in the -  plane when looking at the slope of the constant phase lines in fig .",
    "4c ; both gates , plunger and top , lowered the area when biased negatively .",
    "we address this issue later .",
    "[ fig : antidot ]    we now discuss the fqhe regime , where interference was measured for @xmath23=4/3 , @xmath23=2/3 , @xmath23=2/5 and @xmath23=1/3 . due to space limitation we discuss here only the latter two cases . like in the iqhe , no interference oscillations were observed as function of @xmath6 for cases with = 0 , namely , at @xmath43 and @xmath39 . however , periodic oscillations of the conductance , as function of both @xmath6 and , were observed at @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_third]a .",
    "while the quality of the data deteriorated somewhat , a fast fourier transform of the bare data shows a single , reproducible , distinct peak , corresponding to @xmath45=9.2gauss and @xmath40=1.13mv ( see fig . [ fig : one_third]b ) .",
    "we return to the analysis of this periodicity in the discussion section .",
    "[ fig : one_third ]    the results discussed so far can be encapsulated as follows :    1 .   in each filling factor ,",
    "any of the edge channels can be made to interfere independently of the others .",
    "the periodicities @xmath45 and @xmath40  do not directly depend on the magnetic field ( or the filling factor ) nor the transmission coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 , but only on .",
    "the periodicity in magnetic field is solely determined by a and : @xmath46 as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case @xmath21 , @xmath32 ; here , however , we found it to hold for all values of the transmissions .",
    "similarly , the periodicity in plunger gate voltage depends only on : @xmath47 with @xmath40  monotonically increasing with increasing  ( aside from two exceptions to be discussed below ) .",
    "6 summarizes the measured periodicities @xmath45 and @xmath40  in cases of iqhe and a single case of fqhe ; 3 .   for = 0 , the enclosed flux is independent of the magnetic field , indicating that the relevant area of the interferometer is proportional to @xmath48 ; 4 .   for @xmath350 , the enclosed flux decreases with increased magnetic field , indicating that the interferometer area shrinks faster than @xmath48 ( hence , the minus sign in eq .",
    "[ eq : b_periodicity ] ) .",
    "[ fig : summary ]    the first , and most important , exception to these general statements is the periodicity @xmath40  in the case @xmath44 : it is @xmath49 of the measured value for all other configurations with = 1 .",
    "the second exception takes place for high filling factors , when a large number of channels are being trapped ; such as @xmath50 . as seen in the example @xmath51 in fig .",
    "7 , a ` lattice - like ' structure in the @xmath6-  plane appears instead of the more ubiquitous ` pyjama - like ' stripes .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 and  is still periodic , but it can not be described by a periodic function of a linear combination of @xmath6 and .",
    "this behavior is not yet understood .",
    "[ fig : exotic ]",
    "the empirical eqs . [ eq : b_periodicity ] and [ eq : vg_periodicity ] may be understood by means of a single physical assumption : the relevant area of the interferometer varies as the magnetic field is varied , namely , the magnetic flux through fpi area is @xmath52 , with a depending on  and @xmath6 .",
    "then , the phase evolves as function of @xmath6 and : @xmath53 with the lines of constant phase ( constant flux ) in the @xmath6-  plane given by : @xmath54    in earlier experiments with an electronic two - path mzi , we found that @xmath55 , with the lines of constant phase having an opposite slope from the one measured with the fpi @xcite .",
    "assume that all  fully transmitted channels enclose a similar area @xmath56 .",
    "this area is expected to be field independent since the channels are in equilibrium with the leads .",
    "the inner channels are trapped and thus maintain a discrete and constant number of electrons @xmath57 for small changes in @xmath6 , while a smooth electron exchange can take place between the interfering channel and the fully transmitted ones .",
    "the total amount of charge in the interferometer cell is @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "if charge neutrality is a major consideration then @xmath59 should be independent of @xmath6 , namely , @xmath60 .",
    "assuming @xmath61 , @xmath62 implying that the flux , and hence the ab phase , indeed _ decreased _ with increasing magnetic field at a rate proportional to , and were independent of @xmath6 for = 0 ; as observed in both the integer and fractional cases .    for = 0 , increasing @xmath6",
    "is followed by a decrease in the area @xmath19 in such a way that the flux , and hence the number of occupied states , are kept constant , but the charge density at the center of the fpi cell grows .",
    "a spatial imbalance between electrons and ionized donors takes place .",
    "increasing the field further must lead eventually to relaxation of that imbalance by creation of a hole within the interfering landau level if this is also the only edge channel , or electron tunneling from the trapped channels otherwise . in any case , this leads to abrupt increase of one quantum flux to the interfering loop ( hence , invisible in the interference pattern ) .",
    "the area ` breathes ' with magnetic field .",
    "it decreases monotonically and increases abruptly while keeping the average constant .",
    "the same holds for @xmath350 .",
    "the only difference is that the area decreases with increasing @xmath6 even faster , since the interfering channel loses charge monotonically to the  lower filled landau levels ( whose density increases with field ) leading to the positive slope of the constant phase lines in the @xmath6-  plane .",
    "the periodicity in gate voltage @xmath40 , and in particular its relation to the fractional filling factor @xmath23 , provide an insight to the charge of the interfering quasiparticle .",
    "the dependence on  can be understood if we assume that the capacitance @xmath63 between the plunger gate and the interfering channel depends only on the number of fully transmitted channels ( that screen the plunger gate voltage ) , namely , @xmath64 .",
    "the interfering channel flows at the interface between two areas with different filling factors , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , each with charge @xmath67 per flux quantum @xmath68 .",
    "as long as the sole function of biasing the plunger gate by @xmath69 is to move the interface between the two filling factors by area @xmath70 , and thus expel charge @xmath71 from within the interferometer , we may write : @xmath72 assuming that the change in area does not change the number of quasiparticles enclosed by the interfering loop ( as their number is very small near the center of the conductance plateau ) , the change of area leads to a change in the ab phase , @xmath73 using eq .",
    "[ eq : capacitance ] we get a relation between the interfering quasiparticle charge @xmath74 and the periodicity @xmath40 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 the gate voltage needed to expel one electron .",
    "look first at cases @xmath39 and @xmath43 ; both with a gate voltage periodicity @xmath40@xmath142.2mv ( which is the similar value as for = 0 in the integer cases ) .",
    "evidently , with the assumption @xmath64 , with @xmath63 being independent of the filling factor , the measured expelled charge per period must be in both cases @xmath4 . since the interfering edge channel in both cases belongs to the @xmath49 fractional state , @xmath77 , and the interfering quasiparticle charge , deduced directly from eq .",
    "[ eq : charge ] , must be @xmath78 ; agreeing with our expectations .",
    "what happens in the case @xmath44 , where the interfering channel belongs to the @xmath79 fractional state ?",
    "the observed periodicity is @xmath40@xmath141.13mv ( see fig .",
    "5 ) - nearly @xmath49 of the period observed in the integer cases @xmath80 .",
    "since the capacitance @xmath81 was found to be independent of filling factor , and the measured periodicity is a third of that observed in the integer regime , the expelled charge per period of the oscillation must be @xmath82 ( directly proportional to @xmath40 ) .",
    "again , for @xmath83 in this case , and the above periodicity , the interfering charge is @xmath84 .",
    "this is a striking example of an expelled charge @xmath82 per period of gate voltage , while the interfering quasiparticles carried charge @xmath85 .    since the periodicity of the oscillations is independent of @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", one can invoke a simpler explanation @xcite for the expelled charge in each period , which is valid only in the coulomb blockaded limit , namely , when @xmath21 & @xmath32 . in that limit , the charge enclosed by the constrictions must be quantized in units of the elementary charge in the incompressible regions within the two constrictions .",
    "for cases @xmath39 and @xmath43 , the filling factor within the constrictions is zero and the expelled charge is that of the electron ; as indeed was observed .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath44 , the filling factor in the constrictions is @xmath49 and the expelled charge must be @xmath82 ; again , agreeing with the observation .",
    "[ fig : top_gate ]      the significance of coulomb interactions in the fpi was tested by adding a grounded metal gate that fully covered the fpi s area ( ` large top - gate ' , or ltg ) ; as was also done in ref .",
    "this gate effectively increased the screening of the uncompensated charges . while the addition of the ltg to the smaller fpi ( area 4.4@xmath15m@xmath16 ) did not affect the orientation of the constant phase lines ( it did increase the periodicity in plunger gate voltage , which is expected as the plunger gate is less effective due to screening provided by the ltg biasing ) , adding a ltg to the larger fpi ( area 17.6@xmath15m@xmath16 , as seen in fig .",
    "8a ) led to markedly different results .",
    "first , unlike all our previous results , ab oscillations were measured as function of magnetic field also for cases with = 0 , such as @xmath86 & @xmath33 .",
    "second , as seen in fig .",
    "8b for the case @xmath87 , the orientation of the constant phase lines in the @xmath6-  plane was reversed , indicating an increased flux with increasing magnetic field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the area determined from the ab periodicities in @xmath6 still did not match the expected area .",
    "our experiments provide a detailed first step study towards the realization of interferometers that might give direct evidence of the statistics of fractionally charged quasiparticles .",
    "our studies covered interference of the different edge channels of complex edge structures in integer and a few fractional states in the qhe regime .",
    "we found that the interferometers are very strongly affected by coulomb interactions , which radically modify the interferometer area with magnetic field - independent of the coupling strength to the leads ( in or away from the coulomb blockade regime ) . interfering charges of @xmath88 , @xmath82 and @xmath85 where deduced from the interference patterns .",
