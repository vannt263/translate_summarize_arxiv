    "recent observational and theoretical evidence suggest that accretion - powered x - ray sources , of both the galactic and extragalactic variety , may exhibit outflowing plasma , i.e. winds , emanating from a compact region near the central source ( e.g. elvis 2003 ; arav 2003 ; brandt & schulz 2000 ; proga & kallman 2002 ) .",
    "comptonization effects in those putative outflows are likely to alter the intrinsic continuum spectra of accretion powered compact objects .",
    "the basic idea is that electron scattering of photons from a central source entering the expanding outflow experience a decrease in energy ( downscattering ) .",
    "the magnitude of this decrease is of first order in @xmath3 and in @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the outflow speed , c is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the initial photon energy , and @xmath7 is the electron rest mass .    the basic idea is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "there present a simple explanation of the diverging flow effect on the photon propagation through the medium .",
    "a photon emitted outwards near inner boundary and then scattered at a certain point by an electron moving with velocity @xmath8 , is received by an electron moving with velocity @xmath9 as shown with frequency @xmath10 $ ] where @xmath11 is a unit vector along the path of the photon at the scattering point . in a diverging flow @xmath12 and photons are successively redshifted , until scattered to an observer at infinity .",
    "the color of photon path ( in figure 1 ) indicates the frequency shift in the rest frame of the receiver ( electron or the earth observer ) . on the other hand , referring to the right - hand side of figure 1 , in a converging flow @xmath13 and photons are blueshifted .",
    "the classical compton ( recoil ) effect @xmath14 has been well understood for a long time .",
    "basko , sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1974 ) , hereafter bst74 first studied the downscattering effects in the interaction of x - ray radiation of the central source with the relatively cold atmosphere of the optical companion in a binary system .",
    "they predicted the shape of the x - ray reflection spectrum of the companion and applied these results to the her x-1 system .",
    "x - ray observations of her x-1 by a number of groups ( e.g. sheffer et al .",
    "1992 , still et al . 2000 and etc . ) confirmed this prediction .",
    "in particular , the numerical calculations by bst74 demonstrated that the reflection of the bremsstrahlung spectrum distorted the high - energy continuum above 10 kev producing the characteristic continuum excess feature , or `` bump '' , in the @xmath15 kev spectrum .",
    "this feature was also identified by sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) , hereafter st80 , who found that the transmitted , downscattered spectrum is formed as a result of the reprocessing of x - ray radiation from the central source in an ambient spherical cloud . from these facts",
    "one can conclude that this distortion of the continuum is not an intrinsic property of the particular space photon distribution , but it is rather a result of _ effective _ downscattering ( in terms of the mean number of scattering and the energy loss per scattering ) x - ray photons diffusing through the intervening medium .    in this paper",
    "we show that this is precisely the case .",
    "we formulate the problem of the photon diffusion in generic terms and demonstrate a specific solution for bulk motion where effects of a recoil and divergence of the flow are taken into account . the emergent spectrum as an outcome of this solution",
    "has all these aforementioned features of the downscattering .",
    "the details of the radiative transfer problem taking into account downscattering effects ( recoil and doppler effect in the divergent flow ) and its solution are given in  2 . in section 3",
    ", we apply our model to observational data for several galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "we attempt to demonstrate the compton downscattering effects in relatively cold outflows for which temperature is of order @xmath1 k and disk atmospheres which are necessary constituents of x - ray sources .",
    "for example , cygnus x-3 is believed to be characterized by dense circum - stellar ( or circum - disk ) winds , provides an interesting test case .",
    "a number of additional sources , which have been noted in the literature to exhibit evidence for strong``compton reflection '' , e.g. gs1353 - 64 and gx339 - 4 , have also been included in our analysis .",
    "we consider the possibility that this well documented distortion of the power - law continuum above 10 kev , may in some cases be due to downscattering from out - flowing plasma rather than from a static reflecting media .",
    "we further speculate that this could possibly apply to extra - galactic ( i.e. agn ) as well as galactic accretion objects (  4 ) , although we do not present any analysis of agn here .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "the problem of photon propagation in a fluid in bulk motion has been studied in detail in a number of papers [ see e.g. blandford & payne ( 1981 ) , hereafter bp81 ; payne & blandford ( 1981 ) , hereafter pb81 ; nobili , turolla & zampieri ( 1993 ) ; titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1997 ) ; titarchuk , kazanas & becker ( 2003 , hereafter tkb03 ) ; laurent & titarchuk ( 1999 ) , ( 2001 ) , ( 2004 , hereafter lt04 ] . in particular , tkb03 present a general formulation and a solution of the spectral formation in the diverging outflow .",
    "they demonstrated that the resulting spectrum can be formed as a convolution of energy and space diffusion solutions .",
    "the spread function , given by a green s function formulation , applied to a monochromatic injection yields a redshift - skewed line which is a power law at low energies .",
    "furthermore , monte - carlo simulations show that the line width has a strong dependence on @xmath3 , optical depth @xmath16 and the energy of the monochromatic line @xmath17 only when the flow temperature @xmath18 kev ( lt04 ) .",
    "tkb03 and lt04 also establish that the shape of the spectral line should be closely related to the photon source distribution in the flow .",
    "comparison of the theoretical spectra with data show that observed red - skewed lines are formed as a result of transmission of the x - ray radiation through outflows of moderate thomson optical depth ( @xmath19 ) .    to apply these radiative transfer results to observational data",
    ", we have developed a generic analytical formulation which leads to a simple analytic expression for modification of the emergent spectrum due to recoil and velocity divergence effects in the flow .",
    "for the recoil effect , we extend the results of st80 who show that the downscattering feature , or `` bump '' , can appear superposed on power - law spectra with energy spectral indices @xmath20 as a result of photon diffusion through a static cloud . from st80 and calculations presented here , one might conclude such bumps are not a necessarily a feature of disk reflection , but could instead be a generic feature of the photon reprocessing in a relatively cool , ambient plasma characterized by temperatures of order @xmath1 k.      let @xmath21 be the radial number density profile of an outflow and let its radial outward speed be    @xmath22    obtained from mass conservation in a spherical geometry ( here @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the proton mass ) .",
    "the thomson optical depth of the flow from some radius r to infinity is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the electron density , @xmath27 is the thomson cross section , @xmath28 is a radius at the base of the outflow . because our final results are independent of the velocity and density profiles below for simplicity of presentation we use @xmath29 ( a constant velocity outflow ) . in this case @xmath30 .",
    "the transfer of radiation within the flow in space and energy is governed by the photon kinetic equation ( bp81 , eq .",
    "18 ) for the photon occupation number @xmath31 , which in steady state reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dimensionless photon energy , @xmath34 is the inverse of the scattering mean free path , @xmath35 , is the flow velocity , @xmath36 is the radial unit vector and @xmath37 is the photon source term .",
    "the spectral flux @xmath38 ( pb81 ) is given in terms of @xmath31 by    @xmath39    and must satisfy the following boundary conditions : ( a ) conservation of the frequency integrated flux over the outer boundary , namely    @xmath40    \\(b ) in terms of the specific intensity of the radiation , the second inner boundary condition specifies that the escaping radiation from the inner boundary be equal to the radiation entering the wind shell through the inner boundary ( see fig . 1 for the wind geometry ) .",
    "we neglect here the possible absorption of the radiation at the central source ( black hole ) .",
    "thus the occupation number should satisfy some kind of the reflection condition at the inner boundary @xmath41 .",
    "namely the photon flux at the inner boundary is zero ( all photons scattered in the outflow shell and escape through the inner boundary subsequently return ) .",
    "@xmath42 in this formulation of the problem the number of photons emitted in the wind shell equals to that escaped to the earth observer ( i.e. the photon number is conserved ) .",
    "this can be proven using eqs .",
    "( 3 ) , ( 4 - 5 ) . consequently ,",
    "if the high energy photons lose their energy in the way out but the number of photons is conserved _ it has to be the accumulation of the photons at a particular lower energy band_. this accumulation effect was previously noted by st80 for the case when the photon energy loss ( downscattering ) was determined by the recoil effect only ( see fig . 10 in there ) . in section 2.3",
    "we demonstrate this accumulation effect when the recoil and flow divergence dowscattering effects are taken into account .",
    "it is worth noting that in tkb03 the goal was to demonstrate the pure effect of the flow divergence on a spectral line as a result of multiple scatterings with the plasma free electrons .",
    "they thus omitted the recoil term in the left hand side of equation ( [ radtrans ] ) .",
    "they were also interested to applying their solution to the spectral formation of iron lines for which photon energies are about 6.4 kev and lower .",
    "for such energies the recoil effect can be safely neglected ( see st80 ) . on the other hand",
    "if one is interested in the modification of continuum spectrum at energies higher than 10 kev by multiple downscattering events in the `` cold '' medium this effect must be taken into account .",
    "below we show how one can generalize the tkb03 solution including the recoil term in the radiative transfer equation .",
    "we apply a particular method for the separation of variables suggested in titarchuk ( 1994 ) , hereafter t94 , and successfully used in tkb03 , to obtain our solution .    in order to further proceed with the solution derivation",
    "we should note that laurent and titarchuk ( 2004 ) find that the coefficient in the diverging term of equation ( [ radtrans ] ) @xmath43 can be replaced by a constant @xmath44 . strictly speaking",
    "@xmath45 is a function of @xmath46 and consequently of @xmath16 , namely @xmath47 .    using the fokker - planck equation",
    "( 3 ) in tkb03 ] and a method developed by titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis ( 1997 ) ( see appendix d there ) one can relate the mean energy change per scattering , @xmath48 , for photons undergoing numerous scatterings in the flow to @xmath49 : @xmath50e\\approx -(2f\\beta/\\tau_{0 } ) e\\label{deltae}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the flow velocity , @xmath36 is the radial unit vector , @xmath52 is the inverse of scattering mean - free - path @xmath53 .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath54 , in formula ( [ deltae ] ) is of order unity and lt04 obtain its precise value using their mc simulations .    in lt04 ( specifically , figure 2 of that paper )",
    "the escape photon distribution @xmath55 for 5 energy bands is present . in the plot",
    "the time is given in light crossing time units @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the outflow cloud thickness .",
    "photons which escape without any scattering are at 6.6 kev .",

    "the simulated time distribution is fitted by an exponential @xmath60 , with @xmath61 equal to 0.67 identical to that predicted by diffusion theory [ see sunyaev & titarchuk in 1985 ( hereafter st85 ) ] .",
    "st85 show that the average number of scatterings @xmath62 in the shell of optical depth @xmath63 is @xmath64 so the average photon scattering time is @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "st85 also show that the time distribution for scattered photons in any bounded medium is an exponential , @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .    in this particular case",
    "@xmath70 $ ] , precisely what is obtained in the lt04 simulations .",
    "thus , the average energy of photons escaping after @xmath71scatterings is @xmath72 .",
    "using formula ( [ deltae ] ) one can obtain that @xmath73 for the particular case of @xmath74 and @xmath75 lt04 find that the original photon energy @xmath76 kev is reduced to @xmath77 kev , after @xmath71scatterings in the outflow [ the emergent spectrum is shown in fig 1 , ( lt04 ) left panel ] . the analytical estimate obtained from formula ( [ esc ] )",
    "is close to this value of @xmath78 kev for @xmath79 .",

    "we have assumed that the absolute flux calibration of spi is reliable ( attie et al .",

    "the origin of the data rxte ( pca plus hexte ) or integral ( jem - x plus spi ) are also indicated .",
    "we note that two cyg x-3 observations represent very different intensity states for that source .",

    "figure 3 further illustrates the downscattering effect .",
    "plotted there is our best fit model curve , using gx339 - 4 as a test case , compared to a simple exponentially - folded power - law fitted to the same data , with an accompanying residual plot .",
    "this illustrates the improvement in the fit above 10 kev .",
    "it is clear from these plot that the downscattering effects lead to an improved fit above @xmath0 kev .",
    "also one can see the photoabsorption features below 10 kev and higher k - edge ( in 7 - 9 kev energy band ) in the residual plot ( fig .",
    "it is worth the similar edge features along with the strong @xmath159 lines are detected during x - ray superbursts ( see figs . 5 and 9 in strohmayer & brown 2002 ) .",
    "there is a high probability that they are originated in the radiation driven outflows during burst events .    in figure 4",
    ", we show an example of one of our model fits , in this case to gs  1353 - 64 ( figure 5 is the same result , but plotted in photon space ) .",
    "we have shown that downscattering modification of the primary photon spectrum by an outflowing plasma is a possible mechanism for producing the continuum excess in the @xmath160 kev spectral region .",
    "this is usually attributed to comptonization by a static reflector , such as a downward- or obliquely - illuminated accretion disk , although the overall continuum form differs from that of the basic compton reflection form .",
    "we thus suggest , that in at least some cases , the outflow downscattering effect rather than the standard compton reflection mechanism is responsible for the observed  excess  hard - x - ray continuum .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that outflowing plasma , in the form of stellar or putative disk winds will effect the emergent spectra of compact binaries .",
    "collimated outflows are well known in certain objects , the so called galactic micro - quasars , and there is strong un - collimated or weakly - collimated outflow in additional objects ; as noted cyg x-3 , where in fact spatially extended emission has been resolved ( heindl et al .",
    "2003 ) , and of course the stellar winds in cyg x-1 have been extensively studied .",
    "disk winds may have been observed directly in circinus x-1 , e.g. brandt & schulz ( 2000 ) .",
    "recently , evidence for disk winds in agn has emerged ( e.g. elvis 2001 ; arav 2003 ) .",
    "further observational confirmation is needed , but if present , these winds could produce the downscattering effects we propose .",
    "in addition to evidence for outflows , recent observations suggest that the putative reflector is , in at least certain objects , necessarily much larger than any reasonable disk size(e.g .",
    "mattson & weaver 2004 ; markowitz , edelson & vaughan , 2003 ) .",
    "these arguments are based on temporal signatures ; specifically the lack of a prompt response of the `` reflected '' emission to the continuum assuming light travel times within reasonable accretion disk spatial scales .",
    "while an accretion disk torus has been suggested as an alternative , i.e. more remote , reflector , the same temporal signatures could be reproduced within the context of a central source and an ambient outflow .",
    "we note the concerns of some authors , e.g. miller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , that the hot disk inner - disk component and high frequency qpos (  few times 100 hz ) seen in accreting black hole ( bh ) at the highest inferred accretion rates would not be visible through an `` optically thick '' outflow .",
    "those authors thus rule out any possibility of ambient spectral reprocessing and distortion of the iron line feature , such as broadening and red - wing enhancement , by the outflow . on the other hand ,",
    "laurent & titarchuk ( 2004 ) infer the outflow thomson optical depth @xmath161 of the out - flowing medium from parameter fitting using xmm and asca measurements of broad , red - shifted iron lines .",
    "they find that @xmath161 never exceeds  2 - 3 in any of the cases analyzed .",
    "presumably , the observer sees the radiation of the bh central source through the `` haze '' of the moderate optical depth .",
    "furthermore titarchuk , cui & wood ( 2002 ) , hereafter tcw02 give a precise model for the loss of the modulation due photon scattering .",
    "it follows from tcw02 that the outflow optical depth @xmath162 would need to be around 16 and higher in order to suppress qpo amplitude of frequency 100 hz [ see formula ( 5 ) in tcw02 ] .",
    "we have shown that this very optically thick outflow is ruled out by observations .",
    "our results confirm the lt04 results in the sense that all effects of reprocessing and line distortion can plausibly occur in outflows characterized by moderate optical depth .",
    "furthermore , recently laming & titarchuk ( 2004 ) , hereafter lat04 , formulate a generic problem of the outflow illumination by the hard radiation of the central object and they calculate the outflow temperature and ionization balance as a function of the ionization parameter .",
    "natural assumptions regarding the x - ray spectral distribution of the central source radiation ( comptonization like spectra ) and velocity distribution in the outflow ( constant velocity wind ) are applied .",
    "they find that iron @xmath159 photons are generated by the absorption of x - ray photons at energies higher than the k - edge ( i.e @xmath163 kev ) ( see these k - edge features in fig.3 ) .",
    "electron scattering of the @xmath159 photons within the highly ionized expanding flow leads to a decrease of their energy ( redshift ) which is of first order in @xmath3 ( this is clearly illustrated in fig.1 ) _ this photon redshift is an intrinsic property of any outflow for which divergence is positive_. lat04 find the range of the parameter @xmath164 ( which is proportional to the inverse of the so called `` ionization parameter '' used in the literature ) is about @xmath165 cm and _ the range of the wind temperature is about @xmath1 k _ when the observed @xmath159 lines are produced in the wind ( where @xmath166 is the source luminosity in @xmath167 ergs s@xmath168 ) .",
    "they also find that the equivalent widths of red skewed fe k@xmath155 originated in the wind is order of kev .",
    "we have developed an analytic formulation for the emergent spectrum resulting from photon diffusion in a spherically expanding comptonizing media , characterized by two model parameters : an average number of scatterings in the medium @xmath62 and efficiency the energy loss in the divergent flow @xmath127 . in this formulation of the radiative transfer problem",
    ", the number of photons emitted in the wind shell equals that which escape to the earth observer ( i.e. the photon number is conserved ) .",
    "consequently , if the high energy photons lose their energy on the way out but the number of photons is conserved , _ it has to result in the accumulation of the photons at a particular lower energy band_.    application of the model to high - energy spectra of several compact binaries , which have been previously modeled within the compton reflection scenarios , seems to lead to a satisfactory representation of the data .",
    "we suggest that in some instances , the apparent @xmath169kev continuum enhancement seen in galactic and extra- galactic sources is due to downscattering effects associated with an outflow rather than to reflection by a disk",
    ".    we may also conclude _ that scattering and absorption of the primary line photons in the relatively `` cold '' outflow ( that temperature is few times @xmath1 k ) lead to the downscattering modification of the continuum and to the formation of red - skewed lines ( that is a more natural and probable mechanism than the general relativistic effects in the innermost part of the accretion flow)_.    in future work , we will employ detailed monte - carlo calculations to further explore the range of validity .",
    "in addition to galactic binaries , extra - galactic sources may be characterized by out - flowing plasma . with the expanding database of integral observations , which will hopefully lead to an increasingly accurate characterization of the high - energy continua , it may be possible to to explore this idea .",
    "in addition to the continuum , we will explore the possibility of the line feature formation in the wind .",
