    "to verify whether or not the higgs mechanism is responsible for spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking as expected by the standard model ( sm ) , or indeed , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , one must perform an experimental reconstruction of the higgs self - energy potential .",
    "this reconstruction requires the measurement of the higgs boson mass(es ) and the triple and quartic higgs self - couplings .",
    "the triple higgs self - coupling may become accessible to direct measurement at an electron - positron linear collider ( lc ) with centre - of - mass energy at the tev scale . in this study",
    "we compare the signal of the most promising channel with its dominant electroweak ( ew ) and qcd backgrounds to assess the feasibility of its measurement .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a discussion of the triple higgs self - coupling in the sm , and are under investigation elsewhere @xcite . ] and in particular double higgs - strahlung off @xmath0 bosons , in the process @xmath1 .",
    "we adopt the @xmath6 decay channel over the higgs mass range @xmath7 gev and assume very efficient tagging and high - purity sampling of @xmath8 quarks .",
    "then the backgrounds to the @xmath9 measurement are primarily the ` irreducible ' ew and qcd backgrounds @xmath10 .",
    "the ew background is of @xmath11 away from resonances , but can , in principle , be problematic due to the presence of both @xmath0 vectors and higgs scalars yielding @xmath12 pairs .",
    "in contrast , the qcd background is of @xmath13 . here ,",
    "although there are no heavy objects decaying to @xmath14 pairs , the production rate itself could give difficulties due to the presence of the strong coupling .",
    "in addition , the double higgs - strahlung process ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_hh ] ) contains diagrams proceeding via an @xmath15 intermediate state but not dependent on @xmath9 , as well as a diagram sensitive to the triple higgs self - coupling ( the right - hand graph of fig .",
    "[ fig_hh ] ) .",
    "[ fig_hh ]    the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section details the procedure adopted in computing the relevant scattering amplitudes .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] displays our numerical results and contains our discussion .",
    "finally , in the last section , we summarize and conclude .",
    "the signal process is rather straightforward to calculate in the case of on - shell @xmath15 production ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for analytic expressions of the matrix elements ( mes ) and further discussions of related signal processes ) .",
    "the ew background is more complex , deriving from many graphs with different resonant structures . in order to perform an efficient integration",
    "we have grouped the feynman diagrams into different collections of diagrams with identical ( non-)resonant structure .",
    "this categorization allows one to compute each of the topologies separately , with the appropriate mapping of variables , thus optimizing the accuracy of the numerical integration .",
    "furthermore , one is able to assess the relative weight of the various subprocesses in the full scattering amplitude , giving added insight into the fundamental dynamics . in contrast the qcd background contains fewer diagrams , with only five different ( non-)resonant topologies .",
    "this makes integration much simpler than in the ew case and it can be carried out with percent accuracy directly over the full me using standard multichannel monte carlo methods . for further details and numerical inputs see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that total and differential rates are those at the partonic level , as we identify jets with the partons from which they originate . to resolve the final state @xmath8 ( anti)quarks as separate systems , we impose the following acceptance cuts : @xmath16 gev on the energy of each @xmath8 ( anti)quark and @xmath17 on the relative separation of all possible @xmath18 combinations .",
    "we further assume that @xmath8 jets are distinguishable from light - quark and gluon jets ( by using , for example , @xmath19-vertex tagging techniques ) . however , no efficiency to tag the four @xmath8 quarks is included in our results .",
    "the @xmath0 boson is treated as on - shell and no branching ratio is applied to quantify its possible decays . in practice , in order to simplify the treatment of the final state , one may assume that the @xmath0 boson decays leptonically ( that is , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ) or hadronically into light quark jets ( that is , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 ) .",
    "also , we have not included initial state radiation ( isr ) @xcite in our calculations .",
    "the total signal cross section is plotted as a function of @xmath24 in the top - left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] , for three centre - of - mass ( cm ) energies . even at low higgs masses",
    "where both the production and decay rates are largest , the signal is rather small .",
    "in fact , the signal is below @xmath25 femtobarns for all energies from 500 to 1500 gev , although this can be doubled simply by polarizing the incoming electron and positron beams .",
    "thus , as already recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where on - shell production studies of the signal were performed , luminosities of the order of one inverse attobarn need to be collected before statistically significant measurements of @xmath9 can be performed .",
    "the decrease of the signal with increasing higgs mass is due to suppression of the @xmath26 decay channel . above @xmath27 gev",
    "it becomes overwhelmed by the opening of the off - shell @xmath28 decay ( see , for example , fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the production cross section for @xmath1 without specifying the subsequent decay is much less sensitive to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , because the signal is an annihilation process proportional to @xmath29 , a larger cm energy ( @xmath30 ) tends to deplete the production rates , as long as @xmath31 .",
    "when this is no longer true , e.g. , at 500 gev and @xmath32 gev , phase space suppression can overturn the @xmath29 propagator effects .",
    "this is evidenced by the crossing of the curves for 500 and 1000 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig_cross ] .",
    "[ fig_cross ] also shows the background processes plotted with respect to @xmath24 for the three cm energies . as anticipated , the ew background is problematic due to its resonance structures , whereas the qcd background presents no such difficulty and does not significantly obscure the signal , despite the strong coupling constant .",
    "our categorization of the ew background into different resonant topologies now facilitates a closer examination .",
    "in particular we observe that only four sub - processes dominate the background .",
    "generic feynman diagrams of these sub - processes can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_h ] , together with their contribution to the total ew background rate , as a function of the higgs boson mass .",
    "all other ew sub - processes are much smaller , rarely exceeding @xmath33 femtobarns , and have little effect on the kinematics or magnitude of the background .    the qcd background is dominated by @xmath34 production with one of the two @xmath0 bosons decaying hadronically into four @xmath8 jets . also significant",
    "is single higgs - strahlung production ( off a @xmath0 ) with the higgs scalar subsequently decaying into @xmath35 via an off - shell gluon .",
    "the contributions of the other diagrams , which do not resonate , are typically one order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mediated graphs , with the interferences smaller still ( and generally negative ) .",
    "we now investigate several differential spectra , to find kinematic cuts which will suppress the backgrounds .",
    "the distributions in @xmath38 and @xmath39 can not be further exploited after the acceptance cuts are made .",
    "instead we consider the invariant masses of @xmath8 ( anti)quark systems : for 2@xmath8 systems where the @xmath8 jets come from the same production vertex ( ` right ' pairing ) or otherwise ( ` wrong ' pairing ) ; for 3@xmath8 systems , and for the 4@xmath8 system .",
    "the spectra for the 2@xmath8 and 4@xmath8 systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dist ] ( the 3@xmath8 spectra are less useful and are not shown here ) .",
    "it is clear that the narrow higgs peak gev one has @xmath40 mev .",
    "the higgs resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig_dist ] are smeared by incorporating a @xmath41 gev bin width . ] in the @xmath42 distribution , can be exploited to reduce the qcd background .",
    "although the ew process also displays a resonance at @xmath24 , only one 2@xmath8 invariant mass will peak here compared to two combinations in the signal .",
    "the ew background can therefore also be cut away .",
    "finally , one may require that none of the 2@xmath8 invariant masses reproduce a @xmath0 boson , provided that the invariant mass resolution of di - jet systems is at least as good as the difference @xmath43 , in order to resolve the @xmath0 and @xmath44 peaks .",
    "the @xmath45 spectra is also useful in distinguishing signal from background since clearly @xmath45 must always be greater than @xmath46 for the signal process , while it can be lower for both background processes ( especially for the qcd background ) .",
    "in addition to the different resonance structures of signal and background one can exploit the dominantly @xmath47-channel nature of the backgrounds as compared to the @xmath48-channel signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig_dist ] we also show the cosine of the polar angle ( i.e. with respect to the beam axes ) of the four @xmath8 quark system ( or , indeed , the real @xmath0 ) .",
    "notice that the backgrounds are much more forward peaked than the signal .",
    "the qcd events are predominantly @xmath49 production followed by the decay of one of the gauge bosons into four @xmath8 quarks . the @xmath36 pair is produced via @xmath50-channel graphs so the four @xmath8 quarks are preferentially directed forwards and backwards into the detector .",
    "in contrast , the signal is entirely @xmath48-channel resulting in more centrally produced @xmath8 jets .",
    "the ew background has a more complicated structure but is still sizably dominated by forward production .",
    "a similar effect is seen for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , allowing one to separate signal and backgrounds events efficiently .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions of the 4@xmath8 , 3@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 systems were also examined .",
    "however the distributions for the signal and the ew background proved too similar to allow their use as efficient kinematic variables for cuts .",
    "the main features of distributions studied above are rather stable to variation of the cm energy or higgs mass ( within the ranges under discussion ) .",
    "we can therefore optimize the @xmath53 ratio by imposing the cuts : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 in enforcing these constraints , we assume no @xmath8 jet charge determination .",
    "the signal and background cross - sections after the implementation of the selection cuts can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_cross_cut ] .",
    "both background rates are greatly reduced while a large portion of the original signal is maintained .",
    "this results in a @xmath53 ratio which is enormously large for not too heavy higgs masses .",
    "for example , at centre - of - mass energies @xmath57 $ ] gev and for @xmath58 gev , one finds @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this remarkable suppression of the backgrounds comes largely from the invariant mass cuts on @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , they are crucial not only in selecting the @xmath24 resonance of the signal , but also in minimizing the signal rejection around @xmath61 when mispairings occur : notice the shoulder at 90 gev of the @xmath62 signal spectrum .",
    "a number of caveats to our analysis apply .",
    "firstly , the value we have adopted for the resolution is rather high , considering the large uncertainties normally associated with the experimental determination of jet angles and energies , though not unrealistic in view of the most recent studies @xcite .",
    "the ability of the actual detectors in guaranteeing the performances foreseen at present is thus crucial for the feasibility of dedicated studies of double higgs - strahlung events at the lc .",
    "furthermore , one must consider the efficiency of tagging the @xmath8 quarks necessarily present in the final state , particularly in the case in which the @xmath0 boson decays hadronically .",
    "given the high production rate of six jet events from qcd @xcite and multiple gauge boson resonances @xcite in light quark and gluon jets , it is desirable to resort to heavy flavour identification in hadronic samples .",
    "however , the poor statistics of the @xmath15 signal requires a judicious approach in order not to deplete it below detection level .",
    "according to recent studies @xcite , the two instances can be combined successfully , as efficiencies for tagging @xmath63 pairs produced in higgs decays were computed to be as large as @xmath64 , with mis - identification probabilities of light(charmed ) quarks as low as @xmath65 ( and negligible for gluons ) .",
    "if such a projection for the lc detectors proves to be true , then even the requirement of tagging exactly four @xmath8 quarks in double higgs - strahlung events might be statistically feasible , thus suppressing the reducible backgrounds to really marginal levels @xcite .",
    "one should also bear in mind that experimental considerations , such as the performances of detectors , the fragmentation / hadronization dynamics and a realistic treatment of the @xmath0 boson decays , are also important when determining what cuts should be made .",
    "such considerations are beyond the scope of this paper , and are under study elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , the number of signal and backgrounds events seen per inverse attobarn of luminosity at @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 gev , with @xmath58 gev , can be seen in tab .",
    "[ eventtable ] .",
    "one could relax one or more of the constraints we have adopted to try to improve the signal rates without letting the backgrounds become unmanageably large .",
    "however , such a relaxation only marginally effects the signal while significantly reducing the @xmath53 ratio , and should only be done if high luminosities can not be obtained .",
    "kinematic fits can also help in improving the @xmath53 ratio @xcite .",
    ".the number of events for signal and backgrounds per inverse attobarn of luminosity after selection cuts for centre - of - mass energies of @xmath69 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 gev , a higgs mass of @xmath70 gev , and with polarized electron and positron beams . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , the overwhelming irreducible background from ew and qcd processes of the type @xmath71 to double higgs production in association with @xmath0 bosons and decay in the channel @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath72 , should easily be suppressed down to manageable levels by simple kinematics cuts : e.g. in invariant masses and polar angles .",
    "the number of signal events is generally rather low , but will be observable at the lc provided that it provides very high luminosity , excellent @xmath8 tagging performances , and high di - jet resolution . as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one also requires a good forward acceptance for jets since single jet directions in the double higgs - strahlung process can stretch up to about @xmath73 in polar angle .",
