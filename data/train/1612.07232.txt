    "ion - molecule reactions represent a specific class of chemical reactions that differ from neutral - neutral reactions in several important aspects @xcite : firstly , many important ion - molecule reactions are barrierless and exothermic , and are therefore fast , even at low temperatures . secondly , the attraction forces between a nonpolar molecule and an ion are dominated , at long range , by the ion  induced - dipole interaction .",
    "the interaction potential scales with the intermolecular distance @xmath6 as @xmath7 and extends to much larger distances than the potential between two neutral species .",
    "finally , the centrifugal barriers in the intermolecular potential associated with different collisional partial waves are lowered by the long - range attraction so that at a given collisional energy more partial waves contribute to an ion - neutral collision than to the corresponding neutral - neutral collision .",
    "ion - neutral collisions can thus often be described by classical dynamics at temperatures where quantum mechanical effects dominate the corresponding neutral - neutral collision .",
    "studies of chemical processes involving ions at low temperature are motivated in part by the need to understand and model chemical reaction cycles in interstellar molecular clouds @xcite , which are characterized , depending on the nature of the cloud , by temperatures down to the cosmic background temperature of 2.7  k. they are also motivated by the desire to explore the regime of cold and ultracold chemistry where the reactivity is influenced by quantum phenomena  @xcite .",
    "ion - molecule reactions can often be described , at low temperatures , by capture models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such models rely on the assumption that the rate coefficients only depend on the long - range electrostatic interactions between the charge @xmath8 of the ion and the induced ( polarizability @xmath9 ) or permanent electric dipoles , quadrupoles , etc .",
    ", of the neutral species and do not consider the details of the chemical transformation , which are determined by short - range interactions .",
    "capture models usually express the rate coefficients @xmath10 as ratios @xmath11 to the classical langevin - capture rate coefficient @xcite ( in si units ) @xmath12 which is temperature independent and known to provide a good description of exothermic , barrier - free reactions between ions and polarizable molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath4 or n@xmath4 ) down to very low temperatures @xcite , even below 1  k @xcite . in eq .",

    ", the capture rate coefficients must deviate from the classical langevin behavior and reach their quantum ( q ) s - wave - scattering values  @xmath17 @xcite .",

    ", the number of partial waves contributing to the scattering increases until the relative motion of the reactants can be described within the classical approximation . the transition from quantum ( @xmath19 ) to classical ( @xmath20 )",
    "capture takes place in the sub - kelvin range , even for ion - molecule reactions involving the lightest species , and has not been observed experimentally so far . for collisions of ions with neutral diatomic molecules , the rotational degrees of freedom of the neutral molecule get gradually excited in the range from 0.1 to 20 k and unlock themselves from , but remain strongly perturbed by , the anisotropic intermolecular potential and by coriolis interactions @xcite . in this range , which also remains unexplored experimentally , strongly enhanced and quantum - state - specific rate coefficients are predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "we present here a measurement of the energy dependence of the cross section of the reaction @xmath21 in the range of collision energies from @xmath1{k}$ ] to @xmath2{mk}$ ] ( @xmath22 is boltzmann s constant ) . when the collision energy is reduced below @xmath3{k}$ ] , we observe an increase of the rate coefficient and a clear deviation from the classical capture - rate coefficient . at a collision energy of @xmath3{k}$ ] , partial waves up to @xmath23 contribute to the collision . on the basis of the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite and the results presented in the accompanying article @xcite , we attribute the observed enhancement to the joint effects of the ion - quadrupole and coriolis interactions in collisions involving ortho - h@xmath4 molecules in the @xmath5 rotational level , which make up 75% of the beam intensity in our experiments .",

    "the experiments are performed with a merged - beam apparatus designed for studies of ion - molecule reactions at low collision energies  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "two supersonic molecular beams of h@xmath4 are created by expansion of h@xmath4 from liquid - nitrogen - cooled pulsed valves and initially propagate at an angle of 10@xmath24 .",
    "the molecules in one of these two beams are excited from the @xmath25 ground state to long - lived @xmath26 rydberg - stark states ( designated h@xmath27 below ) with principal quantum number @xmath28 and the ion core in the @xmath29 state using a resonant three - photon excitation sequence  @xcite .",
    "the two beams are then merged by deflecting the rydberg molecules with a surface - electrode rydberg - stark deflector and accelerator ( rysdac )  @xcite .",
    "once the two beams are merged , they co - propagate through the reaction zone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , where the reaction @xmath30 is observed by monitoring the yield of h@xmath31 ions after extraction with a pulsed electric field and detection at a microchannel - plate detector located at the end of a time - of - flight mass - spectrometer ( mcp2 ) .",
    "the cross sections of reaction  ( [ rydberg - reaction ] ) are equivalent , within the sensitivity limits of our experiment , to the cross section of reaction  , which can be regarded as taking place within the orbit of the distant rydberg electron without being affected by it , as was demonstrated previously  @xcite .",
    "this equivalence , which has also been exploited in studies of the h@xmath32 reaction @xcite , can be rationalized by comparing the maximal impact parameter @xmath33 of the ion - neutral reaction to the classical rydberg - orbit radius @xmath34 . even at the lowest collision energies ( @xmath2{mk}$ ] ) investigated here , @xmath35 is more than ten times larger than @xmath36 . moreover , in the long - lived rydberg molecules that survive the time interval of more than 50 @xmath14s between initial preparation by laser excitation and the reaction , the rydberg - electron density close to the ion core is negligible .",
    "consequently , the rydberg electron does not influence the reaction but acts like a faraday cage , which shields the charged reactants from heating by external stray fields and allows the control of the collision energy with the precision achievable in neutral - neutral reactions  @xcite .",
    "this control is achieved by varying the temperature of the pulsed valve generating the beam of ground - state molecules while adjusting the valve trigger time for optimal overlap of the two merged packets ( _ i.e. _ , for maximal number @xmath37 of detected h@xmath31 ions ) , or by acceleration of the h@xmath27 molecules using the rysdac .",
    "the distribution of collision energies is determined from the time- and position - dependent velocity distributions of the two beams .",
    "the packet of ground - state h@xmath4 molecules has dispersed strongly when reaching the reaction zone .",
    "this dispersion , which leads to a strong correlation between spatial position and velocity , results from the short opening time of the pulsed valve ( 13  @xmath14s ) and the long distance of about 80  cm between the orifice of the valve and the reaction zone .",
    "the packet of rydberg molecules , in contrast , is strongly localized when released from the rysdac and disperses only weakly , corresponding to a translational temperature of approximately 300  mk .",
    "the h@xmath27 sample thus remains strongly localized in space as it propagates through the sample of ground - state h@xmath4 molecules in the reaction zone . at very low mean collision energies ,",
    "the distribution of collision energies , and thus the energy resolution of the measurement , is limited by the translational temperature of the h@xmath27 rydberg molecules . for higher relative velocities of the two beams ,",
    "the energy resolution depends on the time during which the two beams are allowed to interact before the product ions are extracted . to adjust this time ,",
    "the h@xmath31 ion yield is measured by using either a one - pulse or a two - pulse extraction - field sequence , the latter permitting a higher collision - energy resolution , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "under conditions where the opening time of the ground - state h@xmath4 valve is minimized , we observe a weak , second gas pulse originating from the rebounce of the valve plunger .",
    "this rebounce pulse has been fully characterized ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for all experimental results presented below",
    ", we have either fully included its effects in the analysis or made sure that its effects are negligible .",
    "the peak number density of h@xmath4 molecules greatly exceeds that of the h@xmath27 rydberg molecules .",
    "the reaction probability per rydberg molecule is , however , much smaller than one .",
    "the reaction thus follows pseudo - first - order kinetics and the number of formed h@xmath31 ions is directly proportional to the rate coefficient @xmath10 , the number @xmath38 of h@xmath4 molecules and @xmath39 of h@xmath27 molecules , and to the product , averaged over time ( @xmath40 ) and volume ( @xmath41 ) , of the two normalized density distributions , which represents an overlap integral over the reactant distributions @xmath42 the relative number of h@xmath4 molecules as a function of the valve temperature is determined in a separate measurement by electron - impact ionization directly in the reaction zone , while the relative number of h@xmath27 molecules is obtained from the pulsed - field - ionization signal monitored at mcp2 which is recorded together with the h@xmath31 ion signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] and ref .",
    "the overlap factor @xmath43 depends on the experimental parameters ( indicated by the index @xmath44 ) and is obtained , together with the mean collision energy and energy resolution , by monte - carlo particle - trajectory simulations of the two beams .",
    "the simulations are based on the experimentally measured velocity and density distributions of the h@xmath4 ground - state beam , the well - defined electric - potential functions applied to the rysdac , and the exact geometry and timings of the experiment , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . additionally , the efficiency with which a product ion is detected depends on the center - of - mass velocity of the reactants , the velocity and propagation direction of the product ion , and the time interval between formation and extraction of the product ion .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath45 is also determined by monte - carlo simulations of the reaction and detection process  @xcite .",
    "the relative rate coefficient of reaction  ( [ eq : reaction ] ) is then obtained by dividing the measured number @xmath37 of h@xmath31 ions by the product @xmath46 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "in a previous set of experiments @xcite , we measured the relative cross section of reaction  ( [ eq : reaction ] ) over the range of collision energies between @xmath47  k and @xmath48  k , typical for molecular clouds in the interstellar medium , under conditions where the velocity of the rydberg - h@xmath4 beam was always lower than that of the ground - state h@xmath4 beam . to study the range of collision energies below @xmath48  k in the present study",
    ", we slightly accelerated the rydberg - h@xmath4 beam to a velocity of 1800  m / s and varied the collision energies by tuning the temperature of the ground - state h@xmath4 valve from @xmath49c , at which point the velocity of the ground state molecules is lower than that of the rydberg molecules , to @xmath50c , where it is higher .",
    "the relative mean velocity of the beams passes through zero at a ground - state - h@xmath4-beam valve temperature of @xmath51c .",

    "[ fig2]b , where the dots and the vertical bars indicate the mean value of the collision energies and the full widths of the distributions of collision energies , respectively , which we know precisely from separate measurements and from the full numerical simulation of the propagation of both beams , as described in detail in ref .  @xcite . when the relative mean velocity of the two beams passes through zero , the mean collision energy is only @xmath52  mk , limited by the velocity distribution of the rydberg h@xmath4 beam , as discussed above .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty in the determination of the valve temperature at which the relative velocity of the two beams crosses zero to be about 1  k , leading to a negligible uncertainty in the determination of the collision energy ( see fig .",

    "the fact that this dashed curve significantly drops below 1 ( by about 6% ) at the lowest valve temperatures is the consequence of a reduced detection efficiency of the h@xmath31 product ions . because the velocity of the rydberg - h@xmath4 beam is kept constant during the measurement , the mean center - of - mass velocity of the reactants decreases as the ground - state h@xmath4 beam velocity is reduced .",
    "the h@xmath31 product ions that are emitted against the propagation direction of the merged beams , and which make the largest part of the h@xmath31 signal , are detected slightly less efficiently as the center - of - mass velocity is reduced because the fastest h@xmath31 ions emitted in the backward direction are lost from the detection volume before the product - extraction electric field is applied .",
