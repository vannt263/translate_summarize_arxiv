    "it is commonly believed that the spectra of particles produced in inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions originate not only from a projectile and a target fragmentations but also from a central production component @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there are many phenomenological and experimental evidences supporting the idea of a two - component picture ( independent target and projectile contributions ) of soft particle production in hadronic collisions .",
    "one of these is the success of the wounded nucleon model @xcite in description of pseudorapidity spectra of charged particles in @xmath2 collisions measured by the phobos collaboration at @xmath3 gev @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this calculation biaas and czy @xcite explicitly assumed that all particles are produced independently from the left- and right - moving wounded nucleons . as a result",
    "the wounded nucleon fragmentation function was extracted .",
    "similar analysis was performed in the wounded quark - diquark model @xcite which resulted in simultaneous description of the phobos @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions data at @xmath3 gev in almost full pseudorapidity range .",
    "the two - component picture of pion ( and baryon ) production in hadronic collisions was also extensively studied at sps energies @xcite .",
    "it was proved to be consistent with many experimental findings which include ( i ) the absence of long - range two - particle correlations in @xmath8 collisions at @xmath9 ( ii ) the presence of forward - backward multiplicity correlations in @xmath8 collisions at @xmath10 and ( iii ) the @xmath11 dependence of the @xmath12 ratio in averaged @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions .",
    "the wounded nucleon fragmentation function deduced from the above was found to be in a good qualitative agreement with the one extracted from the analysis of @xmath2 collisions data in the wounded nucleon ( quark - diquark ) model @xcite .",
    "indeed , both functions are peaked in the forward direction and substantially feed into the opposite hemispheres .",
    "this fact also speaks for the validity of the two - component picture of soft particle production .",
    "unfortunately , the above - mentioned procedures rely on rarely available precise experimental data either in nucleon - nucleus ( deuter - nucleus ) collisions or in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath8 collisions .",
    "moreover , in the former case we also rely on the specific model of particle production in such reactions .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the particle density from one wounded nucleon can be extracted solely from appropriate multiplicity measurements in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "our method is based on measurement of average numbers of produced particles @xmath0 and pairs of particles @xmath15 in different symmetric and asymmetric bins .    in the next section",
    "we describe our method in detail . in section 3",
    "some comments are included .",
    "all calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "the measurement of a single wounded nucleon fragmentation function can be performed as follows .    in the first step we measure in @xmath8 collisions the average numbers of produced particles @xmath16 and pairs of particles @xmath17 in the combined interval @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two symmetric ( around @xmath21 in the c.m . frame ) rapidity intervals .",
    "the schematic view of this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the arrows indicate that the left- and right - moving wounded nucleons may populate particles into both intervals .",
    "@xmath22 is the probability that a particle originating from the right(left)-moving wounded nucleon goes to @xmath23 interval , under the condition that this particle was found either in @xmath19 or @xmath20 . depends on both position and width of @xmath20 interval ( @xmath19 is symmetric around @xmath21 ) . ]",
    "consequently , the probability that a particle originating from the left(right)-moving wounded nucleon goes to @xmath23 interval equals @xmath24 .     and @xmath17 in the combined interval @xmath18 .",
    "the arrows indicate that each wounded nucleon may populate particles into both intervals . ]    in the second step we repeat the previous measurement but now only in @xmath20 interval , see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "we measure @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where of course @xmath27 .     in @xmath20 interval .",
    "both nucleons may populate to this interval with an appropriate probabilities @xmath22 and @xmath24 . ]    assuming that both nucleons fragment independently we proved , see the appendix , that the probability @xmath22 can be expressed by the previously measured quantities @xmath28    let @xmath29 be the right - moving wounded nucleon fragmentation function . ] .",
    "it is obvious that the probability @xmath22 can be expressed as@xmath30 where the numerator represents the number of particles in @xmath20 interval originating from the right - moving wounded nucleon .    combining ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) we obtain the relation between unknown density of produced particles from a single wounded nucleon ( integrated over @xmath20 ) and previously measured @xmath31 , @xmath17 and @xmath32 .",
    "finally , let us notice that if @xmath20 is sufficiently narrow around @xmath33 we obtain@xmath34 which directly relates the fragmentation function @xmath29 with the rapidity multiplicity distribution measured in @xmath8 collisions @xmath35 .",
    "following comments are in order .",
    "\\(i ) it is interesting to note that the result ( [ p1 ] ) does not depend on the number of active sources of particles ( constituents ) inside the proton .",
    "our method rely only on the assumption that both nucleons fragment independently .",
    "\\(ii ) suppose that the multiplicity distributions in @xmath18 and @xmath20 intervals measured in @xmath8 collisions can be approximated by the negative binomial distribution @xcite with appropriate @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 measures the deviation from poisson distribution . in this case eq . ( [ p1 ] ) has a particularly simple form @xmath39    \\(iii ) it is enough to perform measurement for different bins up to @xmath40 in which @xmath41 .",
    "here @xmath20 is populated only by the right - moving nucleon and @xmath19 only be the left - moving one , thus @xmath42 @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "direct application of  eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) will be disturbed in the far fragmentation region ( @xmath45 ) , where energy conservation effects will play an important role .",
    "\\(iv ) once a single nucleon fragmentation function is measured it can be directly tested in proton - nucleus collisions ( or any other asymmetric nucleus - nucleus collisions ) .",
    "\\(v ) finally , we would like to emphasize that our method apply to any longitudinal variable , not necessary rapidity .",
