    "this substructure can arise from a variety of different physical mechanisms .",
    "examples are the disruption of open clusters @xcite , the dynamical effects induced by non - axysimmetric components of a galaxy , such as a bar or self - gravitating spiral arms ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "another possible mechanism , introduced by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter m09 ) , is related to the response of a galactic disc to the tidal interaction with a satellite galaxy as it merges .",
    "thanks to dynamical friction , relatively massive satellites can reach the centre of the disc before being completely disrupted by the tidal field @xcite .",
    "m09 showed that the sudden energy kick imparted by the gravitational potential of the satellite , as it crosses the plane of the disc , can strongly perturb the velocity field of disc stars located in local volumes such as the solar neighbourhood .",
    "these perturbations can be observed in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane as arc - like features travelling in the direction of positive @xmath2 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the radial and tangential velocity components .",
    "this mechanism , known as `` ringing '' , could explain the presence of high velocity streams observed in the solar neighbourhood , such as the arcturus stream @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown by @xcite , minor mergers can also induce radial mixing in the outer disc , thus partially explaining the lack of correlation between age and metallicity observed in the milky way s thick disc ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an important limitation in the m09 analysis is the extent of the local volume that can be explored to search for signatures of ringing in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane . as the depth of the volume",
    "is increased , a progressively larger number of density waves is included .",
    "this causes the waves to interfere , wiping out the substructure previously observed in this projection of phase - space .",
    "this not only places constraints on the size of stellar samples that can be explored to search for signatures of ringing in the solar neighbourhood , but also makes studying this mechanism in fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations unfeasible .",
    "note that to resolve local volumes as small as , e.g. , 100 pc , an extremely large particle resolution is required .",
    "thus , in m09 only relatively simple high - resolution 2d simulations of massless test - particles were performed to explore this problem .    in this paper",
    "we show that the space of energy and angular momentum is much more suitable for identifying the signatures of ringing in a galactic disc . in this projection of phase - space",
    "much larger local volumes can be explored without erasing the substructure associated with ringing ( section  [ sec : test_part_sim ] ) .",
    "this allows us to analyse a set of fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of a merger between a relatively massive satellite galaxy and a pre - existing thin disc ( section  [ sec : nbody ] ) .",
    "we briefly describe our simulations in section  [ sec : sims ] . in section  [ sec : conclu ] we summarise our results and discuss its application to currently available as well as forthcoming full 6d phase - space samples of thick disc stars in the solar vicinity .",
    "two types of numerical simulations are studied in this work .",
    "first , we analyse a two dimensional massless test - particle simulation of an unrelaxed stellar galactic disc , as described by m09 . in this model , a flat rotational velocity profile",
    "is considered , with a value of 220 km s@xmath3 at 7.8 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "the disc follows an exponential density profile with a scale - length of 3 kpc .",
    "initial velocities for the particles are drawn from gaussian distributions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions .",
    "in particular , the standard deviation in the radial direction is set at @xmath4 km s@xmath3 . to emulate a population that is unrelaxed ,",
    "velocities are purposely chosen so that particles are unevenly distributed in their radial oscillation .",
    "a total of @xmath5 test - particles were used to represent the disc . for more details ,",
    "we refer the reader to m09 .",
    "second , we analyse a set of fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of the merger between a satellite galaxy and a pre - existing galactic thin disc . most of these simulations were first presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , vh08 ) to study the formation of a galactic thick disc due to the heating induced by the merger event . in particular",
    ", the simulations considered in this work are those referred as ",
    "@xmath6 in vh08 , which were set up to emulate a merger event that could have given rise to the milky way s thick disc .",
    "the models for the host and satellite galaxies consist of two fully self - consistent components : a dark matter ( dm ) halo following a nfw profile @xcite , a stellar disc for the host , and a bulge for the satellite system .",
    "the stellar disc follows an exponential density profile , and the satellite s bulge a hernquist profile @xcite .",
    "the properties of the milky way - like host and the satellite systems were scaled to those expected at @xmath7 following @xcite . as described by @xcite , in this picture gas in a halo",
    "conserves its specific angular momentum ( equal to that of the dark matter ) as it cools to form a centrifugally supported disc that grows from the inside out . in the simplest model ,",
    "in which the density profile of the galaxy is modelled as a singular isothermal sphere , the radius of the resulting disc is proportional to the parent halo virial radius .",
    "thus , in a @xmath8-cdm cosmology , this would imply a decrease in the disc size of a factor of  1.7 out to @xmath9 .",
    "later studies have shown that the evolution of the disc size - stellar mass relation predicted by this model is considerably stronger than what observations are suggesting ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note however that the results presented in this work are not strongly dependent on the particular value chosen for the host disc s scale - length .",
    ".initial properties of the three @xmath0-body simulations analysed in this work .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     both disc and bulge are represented with @xmath10 @xmath0-body particles . to study the impact that mergers of different total mass ratios have on the phase - space structure of the disc , three different values of @xmath11",
    "were explored .",
    "these are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "table  [ table : model ] summarises the values of the parameters involved in these models .",
    "note that @xmath15 also sets @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the following is a brief summary of the evolution of the merger simulations analysed in this study .",
    "we refer the interested reader to vh08 for a complete description . in all cases",
    "the satellite was released from a distance of 84 kpc ( @xmath18 ) from the galactic centre in the most likely infalling orbit according to previous studies on distributions of orbital parameters of infalling substructure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here @xmath19 is the host disc s scale - length . in such rather eccentric orbit ( @xmath20 )",
    ", the satellite rapidly reaches the central region of the galactic halo where it is more effectively affected by dynamical friction and tidal disruption .",
    "this causes the satellite to lose orbital angular momentum , which progressively shrinks its infalling orbit .",
    "in such a way , for the simulation with @xmath21 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , the satellite takes roughly @xmath22 , is defined as the time when the satellite runs out of orbital angular momentum . for the kind of orbits considered in this work , the oscillations between the centres of mass of both systems ceases approximately at the same time . ]",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 gyr to reach and settle in the disk centre , respectively .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath12 , the satellite experiences @xmath26 pericentric passages , all of them at less than 20 kpc from the disk centre .",
    "as the satellite decays in its orbits , it induces the formation of tidal arms in the disc , which carry angular momentum from the disk centre outwards . once the satellite is brought on to the plane of the disc by dynamical friction , it transfers kinetic energy from its orbits to the disc stars , increasing their vertical motions and causing a visible thickening . by the end of the simulations the morphological",
    ", structural and kinematical properties of the thickened disc and the disrupted satellite settle down and become stable , which takes place roughly  2 gyr after the satellites have reached the disk centre .",
    "the final scale - heights of the resulting thick disks are @xmath27 for @xmath12 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( see figure 14 of vh08 ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is the scale - height of the pre - existing thin disc .",
    "+     in this section we briefly review the main results presented in m09 and study how the observed substructure in the velocity space of local volumes is distributed in @xmath31-@xmath32 space . in the top panels of figure  [ fig : model_uv_el ]",
    "we show , at six different times , the distribution in the _ u - v _ plane of particles located within a ring of 160 pc width centred at 7.8 kpc from the disc centre .",
    "note that the simulation is axysimmetric .",
    "thus , the rings can be regarded as local volumes . as a consequence of the sudden energy kick imparted on the initially relaxed disc , a radial oscillation",
    "is excited on the disc particles .",
    "the radial frequency of these orbits will depend on both their orbital energies and angular momenta ( see m09 ) .",
    "thus , particles with different energies will have different radial frequencies .",
    "these differences in frequencies induce phase - wrapping in velocity space : at a given time after the perturbation , in a given volume of space , we will observe groups of particles that have completed a different number of radial oscillations .",
    "each one of these groups will have a characteristic frequency or energy .",
    "these groups can be observed in the u - v plane as distinct arc - like features .",
    "note that , as time passes by and the disk relaxes , the arcs get closer together and their number increases .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : model_uv_el ] show the same distribution of particles now projected onto @xmath31-@xmath32 space .",
    "particles that previously were part of a given arc in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane are now distributed along well - defined features of nearly constant energy . due to the wide range covered in the _ v _ velocity component ,",
    "each arc is stretched along the @xmath32 direction .",
    "note that , within a volume as small as the one considered here , the gravitational potential , @xmath33 , can be regarded as a constant .",
    "thus , for groups of particles with approximately constant energy , @xmath34 which explains the arc - like shape of the features observed in the _ u - v _ plane .    as pointed out by m09 , due to the differential rotation of the galactic disc , the separation between arcs in the _ u - v _ plane depends on the galactocentric distance of the volume under study . increasing the size of this volume , and thus sampling a larger range of galactocentric radii , causes the waves to interfere , wiping out most of the observed substructure in velocity space .",
    "this places strong constraints on the size of the sample of stars that can be explored to identify signatures of ringing in the solar vicinity if we use velocity space .    in figure",
    "[ fig : model_dist ] we compare the effect of volume depth in the @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath31-@xmath32 planes for the same simulation and time step .",
    "the top row we show the velocity distribution of particles located inside rings with different widths .",
    "the mean galactocentric distance @xmath35 of each ring is 7.8 kpc and the maximum distance sampled from @xmath35 by these rings is specified in each panel as d@xmath36 .",
    "note that , by including in our sample particles that are only at 250 pc away from @xmath35 , the waves start to interfere and the arcs in _ u - v _ to overlap . in a ring with d@xmath37",
    "kpc all the substructure has been completely erased .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : model_dist ] shows the distribution of the same sets of particles in @xmath31-@xmath32 space .",
    "when very small local volumes are considered , i.e. d@xmath38 kpc , both spaces are equivalent in terms of the observed substructure .",
    "however , it is very interesting to see that even in the ring with largest d@xmath39 kpc substructure can be clearly observed in @xmath31-@xmath32 space . by including particles at larger radii",
    "we include density waves at different energy levels .",
    "in addition , each wave is better defined since particles that were in a different phase of their oscillation , and thus outside the arc , are now included in the sample .",
    "note that , as expected , the separation between density waves decreases as a function of energy , i.e. , with galactocentric radius .",
    "the results presented in this section are important for two reasons .",
    "first , by sampling relatively large local volumes , it is possible to study the properties of ringing in fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations , where the particle resolution is much lower than in the previous experiment .",
    "second , future astrometric missions such as _ gaia _ @xcite will provide very accurate measurements of 6d phase - space coordinates for stars located at distances as large as 2.5 kpc from the position of the sun ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . although the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane and the @xmath31-@xmath32 space are equivalent when searching for signatures of ringing in local spheres with radii as small as 80 pc , the fraction of thick disc stars in this volume will be considerably smaller than in a sphere of 2.5 kpc radius . note that it is in the thick disc where we would expect to find signatures of ringing , since these stars are less affected by perturbations from the galactic bar , spiral structure or giant molecular clouds .",
    "thus , the @xmath31-@xmath40 space will allow us to explore much larger samples of thick disc stars from , e.g. , a future _ gaia _ catalog .",

    "we now explore fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of minor merger events .",
    "as described by vh08 , the spatial and kinematical structures of the pre - existing thin disc are strongly affected by the merger event .",
    "as the satellite decays in its orbit , it passes through the plane of the disc several times . at each passage , disc particles",
    "are impulsively heated by the satellite s potential ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one manifestations of this heating mechanism is the formation of transient , non - self - gravitating spiral arms ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : xy_space ] shows a contour plot of the distribution of particles in the x - y plane of our @xmath43 simulation , 1 gyr after @xmath22 .",
    "it is very interesting to compare this distribution with the one obtained from the test - particles simulation , shown in the left panel of the same figure .",
    "since the energy kick imparted on the test - particles is axisymmetric annular features ( left panel ) rather than spiral arms ( right panel ) , can be observed .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the spiral features observed in our @xmath0-body simulations are not self - gravitating , as they quickly disappear with time .",
    "this can also be inferred from the large values of the radial velocity dispersion of the resulting thick disc shown in figure  [ fig : tm_vel ] . in this figure",
    "we show the radial velocity dispersion profile of the disc at three different times .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is considerably larger at all radii already 0.1 gyr after the satellite galaxy is fully merged .",
    "this profile does not evolve significantly during the next 2.9 gyr of simulation . within 5 to 10 kpc from the disc centre",
    ", the radial velocity dispersion takes a value of @xmath44 km s@xmath3 , which is consistent with the value used in the test - particles simulation .",
    "as expected , the asymmetric drift induced in this way causes a decrease in the rotational velocity as a function of radius after the merger . note",
    "that , although its magnitude decreased by about @xmath45 at @xmath46 kpc , a flat profile is preserved .",
    "we will now analyse solar - neighbourhood - like volumes in the resulting thick disc , to search for signatures of ringing in energy and angular momentum space .",

    "what follows , we focus our analysis on samples of particles located within spheres of 2.5 kpc radius .",
    "the simulations analysed in this work were designed to emulate the result of a minor merger experienced by a milky way - like galaxy at @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the scales of our final thick disc are relatively smaller compared to those observed in the milky way . as explained by @xcite , it is not straightforward to decide which radii corresponds to a solar neighbourhood - like volume .",
    "following their work , we place our sphere at two different locations , namely 5.5 kpc ( @xmath49 ) and 8 kpc ( @xmath50 ) , where @xmath51 kpc is the final scale length of the simulated thick disc .",

    "this distribution was obtained from our @xmath12 simulation .",

    "figure  [ fig : tot_mass_8kpc ] shows the time evolution of this distribution .",
    "note that our solar neighbohood - like volume is rotating with an angular frequency set by the velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , obtained after correcting the final mean rotational velocity profile for axysimmetric drift @xcite . over time , the number of clumps increases and they come closer together , as expected from section  [ sec : test_part_sim ] ( see also m09 ) .",
    "substructure can be clearly observed already at @xmath58 gyr and can be followed until @xmath59 gyr , spanning a total of about 4 gyr .",

    "comparison of this figure with figure  [ fig : tot_mass_8kpc ] reveals the presence of a larger number of clumps at any given time after @xmath22 .",
    "this reflects the dependance of the phase - mixing time - scale on galactocentric distance ( see m09 ) .",

    "interestingly , even for the simulation with a mass ratio @xmath83 ( bottom panels ) , substructure can be clearly observed in the phase - space distribution of disc stars for a period of about @xmath25 gyr .",
    "this is approximately the same period of time that we were able to follow substructure in our @xmath12 simulation .",
    "this can be explained as follows : although the strength of the perturbation on the host s disc depends on satellite s mass , lower - mass satellites take longer to completely sink onto the galactic centre .",
    "for example , in our @xmath29 simulation @xmath84 gyr . as a consequence",
    ", a lower mass satellite can excite the galactic disc for a longer period of time ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "note however that , after @xmath79 , substructure can be followed only for @xmath85 and @xmath86 gyr for the simulation with @xmath87 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "low mass satellites generates density waves with smaller amplitudes and thus , their signatures after @xmath22 disappear faster as they quickly get within the noise level .      in the analysis carried out so far , only particles from the galactic disc were taken into account .",
    "as described by vh08 , a large fraction of the particles from the satellite ends up in a disc - like configuration , with the same spatial orientation as the final thick disc .",
    "therefore , the distribution of the satellite s particles in @xmath31-@xmath32 space could partially overlap with the corresponding distribution of disc particles , complicating the detection of density waves .",
    "the distribution of debris left by a satellite on a solar neighbourhood - like sphere , obtained from a simulation similar to the ones considered here , was already studied in detail by gh10 .",
    "the only difference between their @xmath88 simulation and ours is the particle resolution of the satellite galaxy . to enhance the signatures of stellar streams , the satellite analysed by gh10 was modelled with a number of particles ten times larger than the one used here",
    "( see also vh08 ) .",
    "figure 13 of gh10 shows the distribution of particles from both systems , in four different projections of phase - space .",
    "not surprisingly , for a given energy , particles from the satellites tend to have smaller angular momentum than those from the disc ( see bottom middle panel ) . even in this simulation with a much higher satellite s resolution , substructure from the disc can be easily identified in @xmath31-@xmath32 space .",

    "in this work we have explored the impact that minor mergers have on the phase space distribution of a galactic stellar disc , such as the one in the milky way . using numerical simulations",
    ", we showed that the pseudo - integrals of motion @xmath31-@xmath32 space is well - suited to identify density waves in the disc s velocity field that have been generated by the merger event . in this space , particles in a given volume of physical space",
    "are distributed along features of nearly constant energy , each associated with a different wave .",
    "the separation between density waves at different energy levels indicates the time since the disc was perturbed by the merging satellite .",
    "interestingly , substructure in @xmath31-@xmath32 space can be clearly observed even when solar neighborhood - like spheres with radii as large as 2.5 kpc are considered .",
    "this is in stark contrast with what is observed in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , where the waves inside spheres with radii larger than @xmath90 kpc interfere , wiping out all signatures of ringing .",
    "an important implication of this result is that a larger sample of stars could be explored to search for signatures of minor merger events in the milky way thick disc .",
    "this is relevant not only in the context of the forthcoming full 6d phase space _ gaia _",
    "catalog , but also for available catalogs , such as those provided by rave ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sdss @xcite .    by projecting the distribution of particles located inside spheres of 2.5 kpc radius onto @xmath31-@xmath32 space we were able , for the first time , to study the properties of ringing in fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of disc galaxies minor mergers .",
    "we showed that , in a simulation of a merger between a satellite galaxy and a host disc with a mass ratio @xmath91 , signatures of ringing can be clearly observed for a total of @xmath92 gyr and for about @xmath93 gyr after the merger has concluded .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath94 particles enclosed in our local volumes were enough to resolve a wealth of substructure in the resulting thick disc .",
    "in addition , we showed that the in - fall trajectory of the perturber satellite gives rise to an azimuthal dependence of the structure observed in @xmath31-@xmath32 space .",
    "note that we have only explored distributions of particles in this pseudo - integrals of motion space .",
    "information about orbital properties of the merging satellite , such as its in - fall trajectory or its impact parameter , could be obtained by exploring the distributions of particles angular phases as a function of galactocentric azimuthal angle .",
    "this will be analyse in a follow - up study .",
    "we have also explored the impact that mergers of different total mass ratios have on the phase - space structure of the disc .",
    "interestingly , mergers with mass ratios as small as @xmath29 give rise to density waves in the velocity field of the disc that can also be followed for a total of @xmath92 gyr .",
    "this is a consequence of the longer period of time required by a lower mass satellite to fully merge with its host . on the other hand ,",
    "once the merger concludes substructure can be followed for only @xmath86 and @xmath95 gyr for simulations with mass ratio of @xmath96 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "note that these results are constrained by the low particle resolution of our @xmath0-body simulations ; higher resolution simulations could allow us to follow substructure for longer periods of time .",
    "thus , signatures of minor merger that have evolved for longer than 4 gyr could be identified from the very large and accurate sample of thick disc stars that soon will become available thanks to _",

    "however , their results are not statistically significant since , due to the constraints on the size of the local volume ( @xmath98 kpc ) , samples of only 451 and 766 stars were explored .",
