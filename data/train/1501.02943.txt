    "the searches have been performed with the use of bismuth orthogermanate @xmath6 ( bgo ) scintillation and bolometric detectors .",
    "the solar axions are supposed to interact with atoms via the reaction of axioelectric effect @xmath7 .",
    "this kind of interaction is governed by @xmath8-constant and the cross section depends on the charge as @xmath9 . from this point of view",
    "the bgo detector is a very suitable target , because of the high @xmath10 of bismuth nucleus .",

    "the calibration spectrum measured with pu - be neutron source is shown .    in the spectrum",
    ", one can identify two pronounced peaks at 1.460 mev and 2.614 mev ; these are due to the natural radioactivity of the @xmath24 and of @xmath25 from the @xmath26 family .",
    "the positions and intensities of these peaks were used for monitoring of time stability of the detector .",
    "four cubic ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ) bgo bolometers , containing 1.65 kg of bi , were arranged in a four - plex module , one single plane set - up .",

    "the four crystals were housed in a highly pure copper structure , the same described in @xcite .",
    "neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) germanium thermistor was coupled to each bolometer , ntd acts as a thermometer : recording the temperature rises produced by particle interaction and producing voltage pulses proportional to the energy deposition .",
    "details on electronics and on the cryogenic set - up can be found in @xcite .",
    "the detector was operated for a total live time of 151.7 days .",
    "the different light yield of interacting particles was used to discriminate @xmath30events from @xmath31 ones .",
    "this allowed to strongly increase the sensitivity , due to rejection of all @xmath30events in the region of interest .",

    "the experimentally found condition @xmath46 imposes some constraints on the range of possible @xmath47 and @xmath48 values .    the range of excluded @xmath49 values is shown in fig .  3 , at @xmath50",
    "the limits @xmath51 @xmath52 were obtained for bgo scintillating and bgo bolometer detectors , correspondingly .",

    "our results set constraints on the parameter space of the cp - odd higgs @xmath65 , which arise in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model due to the spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries such as pq - symmetry .",
    "the corresponding exclusion region can be obtained from fig.[muratova_valentina_fig3.pdf ] using the conversion @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coupling of the cp - odd higgs to fermions and @xmath68 is the gauge coupling .",
