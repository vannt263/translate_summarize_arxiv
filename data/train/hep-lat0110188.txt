    "an essential step for understanding and extracting physical information from gauge theories is the elimination of redundant gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "this is usually done by choosing a representative on each orbit of gauge - related fields ( _ gauge fixing _ ) . in ref.@xcite gribov",
    "showed that the coulomb and landau gauge - fixing conditions do not fix the gauge fields uniquely , i.e.  there are many gauge - equivalent configurations satisfying the coulomb or landau transversality condition .",
    "these _ gribov copies _ do not affect perturbative calculations , but their elimination could play a crucial role for non - perturbative features of gauge theories , such as color confinement and hadronization .    in order",
    "to get rid of the problem of spurious gauge copies , gribov restricted @xcite the physical configuration space to the region @xmath2 of transverse configurations , for which the faddeev - popov operator is non - negative .",
    "this region is delimited by the _",
    "first gribov horizon _ , defined as the set of configurations for which the smallest , non - trivial eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator is zero .",
    "we now know that @xmath2 is _ not _ free of gribov copies and that the physical configuration space has to be identified with the _ fundamental modular region _",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the region @xmath2 is of interest in numerical simulations , since it is the space of configurations satisfying the usual lattice coulomb or landau gauge condition .",
    "the restriction of the path integral , which defines the partition function , to the region @xmath2 implies a _ rigorous _ inequality @xcite for the fourier components of the gluon field . from this inequality , which is a consequence only of the positiveness of the faddeev - popov operator",
    ", it follows that the region @xmath2 is bounded by a certain ellipsoid @xmath3 .",
    "this bound causes a strong suppression of the ( unrenormalized ) transverse gluon propagator @xmath4 in the infrared limit @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it was proven @xcite that , in the infinite - volume limit , @xmath4 _ vanishes _ at zero momentum , although the rate of approach to @xmath5 , as a function of the momentum or of @xmath6 , was not established .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the _ divergence _ in the infrared limit of the free massless propagator .    finally ,",
    "because of entropy considerations @xcite , the euclidean probability gets concentrated near the first gribov horizon where the inverse of the faddeev - popov matrix diverges .",
    "this causes an enhancement of the ghost propagator @xmath7 in the infrared limit @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is a clear indication of a long - range effect in the theory that may result in color confinement .",
    "the confinement scenario is particularly simple in the minimal coulomb gauge where the ghost propagator determines directly the coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this case , confinement of color , i.e.  the enhancement at long range of the color - coulomb potential @xmath8 , is due to the enhancement of @xmath9 at small momenta . at the same time , the disappearance of gluons from the physical spectrum is manifested by the _ suppression _ at @xmath10 of the propagator @xmath11 of 3-dimensionally transverse would - be physical gluons .",
    "remarkably , @xmath8 is the instantaneous part of the @xmath12-@xmath12 component of the gluon propagator @xmath13 , and is a renormalization - group - invariant quantity @xcite .",
    "its fourier transform @xmath14 may serve to define the running coupling constant of qcd by considering @xmath15,where @xmath16 has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "clearly , if the color - coulomb potential @xmath8 is governed by a string tension at large distances , i.e.  @xmath14 goes like @xmath17 at small momenta , then @xmath18 in the infrared limit .",
    "similarly , in landau gauge , one can consider @xcite the running coupling constant @xmath19 \\,[\\,k^2\\,g(k)\\,]^2 $ ] .",
    "this is also a renormalization - group - invariant quantity since ( in landau gauge ) @xmath20 . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath21 if , for example , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the infrared limit . on the contrary , if the gluon progator goes to @xmath5 in the infrared limit and the ghost propagator blows up not faster than @xmath24 then @xmath25 has an infrared fixed point @xcite .",
    "we test these theoretical predictions with data from a numerical study of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , without quarks , in the minimal coulomb and landau gauge at @xmath26 .",
    "simulations were done at different lattice volumes @xmath27 , in order to check for finite - size effects and , if possible , to extrapolate to infinite lattice volume .",
    "details of notation and numerical simulations are given , for the coulomb case , in @xcite and will be presented , for the landau case , in @xcite . for these simulations",
    "we have used a cluster of alpha work - stations ( coulomb and landau data ) and a pc cluster ( landau data ) at the dept .  of mathematical physics of the university of so paulo ( dfma / usp ) .",
    "in the landau case we have also used a pc cluster at the institute of physics of the university of so paulo , so carlos ( ifsc / usp ) .",
    "= 0.45    = 0.45",
    "our data in the minimal coulomb gauge @xcite clearly show ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coulomb ] ) that the equal - time transverse gluon propagator @xmath28 passes through a maximum and decreases as the momentum @xmath29 approaches @xmath30 ( for fixed @xmath6 ) , and that @xmath14 is more singular than @xmath31 at low @xmath29 , which indeed corresponds to a long - range color - coulomb potential .",
    "we have also obtained @xcite an excellent 2-pole fit for @xmath32 .",
    "our fit indicates that the poles occur at complex @xmath33 . in the infinite - volume limit",
    "we have @xmath34 , for @xmath35 in lattice units , or @xmath36",
    "gev@xmath37 for the location of the gluon poles in @xmath38 .",
    "( it follows from the nielsen identities @xcite that these poles are independent of the gauge parameters . )    similarly , in landau gauge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : landau ] ) , the transverse gluon propagator @xmath39 is suppressed in the infrared limit , while the ghost propagator @xmath7 is more singular than @xmath40 . also here",
    "a 2-pole fit can probably be used to fit the data for @xmath39 . in this case , however , we need to improve the statistics in order to have better control over the fits , and we need to simulate at larger lattice volumes ( we went up to @xmath41 ) to probe the infinite - volume limit .    finally , for the running coupling constant @xmath42 we consider @xcite the fitting formula @xmath43   \\ [ ( b g^2)^{-r } + z   ( b g^2)^{\\alpha}]^{-1 } \\ , $ ] which implicitly defines @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are fitting parameters . for small @xmath42 , which corresponds to large momenta",
    ", this formula is dominated by the first term in the denominator , whereas for large @xmath42 , i.e.  small momenta , it is dominated by the second term in the denominator . in particular , @xmath46 governs the strength of the singularity of @xmath42 in the infrared limit ; the case @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48 .    in the coulomb case",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath49 ; this corresponds to @xmath50 , and @xmath51 at low momentum . in the landau case",
    "we have @xmath52 , which implies @xmath53 . in both cases",
    "we have fitted the data with a low momentum cut - off at @xmath54 .",
    "of course , an extrapolation in @xmath55 will be necessary to determine the strength of these singularities in the continuum limit ."
