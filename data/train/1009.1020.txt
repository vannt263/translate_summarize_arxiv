    "invasive and in - situ malignant melanoma together comprise one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the world .",
    "invasive melanoma alone has an estimated incidence of 62,480 and an estimated total of 8,420 deaths in the united states in 2008  @xcite .",
    "early diagnosis is particularly important since melanoma can be cured with a simple excision if detected early .",
    "dermoscopy , also known as epiluminescence microscopy , is a non - invasive skin imaging technique that uses optical magnification and either liquid immersion and low angle - of - incidence lighting or cross - polarized lighting , making subsurface structures more easily visible when compared to conventional clinical images  @xcite .",
    "dermoscopy allows the identification of dozens of morphological features such as pigment network , dots / globules , streaks , blue - white areas , and blotches  @xcite .",
    "this reduces screening errors , and provides greater differentiation between difficult lesions such as pigmented spitz nevi and small , clinically equivocal lesions  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that dermoscopy may actually lower the diagnostic accuracy in the hands of inexperienced dermatologists  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to minimize the diagnostic errors that result from the difficulty and subjectivity of visual interpretation , the development of computerized image analysis techniques is of paramount importance  @xcite .",
    "automated border detection is often the first step in the automated or semi - automated analysis of dermoscopy images  @xcite .",
    "it is crucial for the image analysis for two main reasons .",
    "first , the border structure provides important information for accurate diagnosis as many clinical features such as asymmetry , border irregularity , and abrupt border cutoff are calculated directly from the border .",
    "second , the extraction of other important clinical features such as atypical pigment network  @xcite , globules  @xcite , and blue - white areas  @xcite critically depends on the accuracy of border detection .",
    "automated border detection is a challenging task due to several reasons :    low contrast between the lesion and the surrounding skin ,    irregular and fuzzy lesion borders ,    artifacts and intrinsic cutaneous features such as black frames , skin lines , blood vessels , hairs , and air bubbles ,    variegated coloring inside the lesion , and    fragmentation due to various reasons such as scar - like depigmentation .",
    "numerous methods have been developed for border detection in dermoscopy images  @xcite .",
    "recent approaches include fuzzy c - means clustering  @xcite , gradient vector flow snakes  @xcite , thresholding followed by region growing  @xcite , meanshift clustering  @xcite , color quantization followed by spatial segmentation  @xcite , statistical region merging  @xcite , two - stage k - means++ clustering followed by region merging  @xcite , and contrast enhancement followed by k - means clustering  @xcite .",
    "some of these studies used subjective visual examination to evaluate their results .",
    "others used objective measures including hance _",
    "s xor measure  @xcite , sensitivity & specificity , precision & recall , error probability , and pixel misclassification probability  @xcite .",
    "these measures require borders drawn by dermatologists , which serve as the ground truth . in this paper",
    ", we refer to the computer - detected borders as _ automatic borders _ and those determined by dermatologists as _ manual borders_.    in a recent study , guillod _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a single dermatologist , even one who is experienced in dermoscopy , can not be used as an absolute reference for evaluating border detection accuracy .",
    "in addition , they emphasized that manual borders are not precise , with inter - dermatologist borders and even intra - dermatologist borders showing significant disagreement , so that a probabilistic model of the border is preferred to an absolute gold - standard model",
    ".    only a few of the above - mentioned studies used borders determined by multiple dermatologists .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used fifteen sets of borders determined by five dermatologists over a minimum period of one month .",
    "they constructed a probability image for each lesion by associating a misclassification probability with each pixel based on the number of times it was selected as part of the lesion .",
    "the automatic borders were then compared against these probability images .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite modified guillod _",
    "s method by combining the manual borders that correspond to each image into one using the majority vote rule .",
    "the automatic borders were then compared against these combined ground - truth images .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite compared each automatic border against multiple manual borders independently .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the performance of five recent automated border detection methods on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of manual borders as the ground - truth .",
    "in contrast to prior studies , we employ an objective criterion that takes into account the variations in the ground - truth images .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_rev ] reviews the objective measures used previously in the border detection literature .",
    "section  [ sec_new_meas ] describes a recent measure that takes into account the variations in the ground - truth images .",
    "section  [ sec_exp ] presents the experimental setup and discusses the results obtained , while section  [ sec_conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "all of the objective measures mentioned in section [ sec_intro ] , except for guillod _ et al .",
    "_ s probabilistic measure , are based on the concepts of true / false positive / negative defined in table  [ tab_def ] .",
    "for example , if a lesion pixel is detected as part of the background skin , this pixel is considered to be a false negative . on the other hand ,",
    "if a background pixel is detected as part of the lesion , it is considered as a false positive .",
    "note that in the remainder of this paper , true positive ( tp ) , false negative ( fn ) , false positive ( fp ) , and true negative ( tn ) will refer to the number of pixels that satisfy these criteria .    .",
    "[ tab_def ] definitions of true / false positive / negative .",
    "` actual ' and ` detected ' pixels refer to a pixel in the manual border and the corresponding pixel in the automatic border , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "it can be seen that the ranking remains the same : srm and dtea are still the most accurate and consistent methods . however , using the npri measure , the differences between the methods have become smaller . in addition , this measure considers the variations in the manual borders simultaneously and produces a scalar value , which makes comparisons among methods much easier .",
    "figure  [ fig_sample ] illustrates one advantage of using the npri measure . here",
    "the manual borders are shown in red , green , and blue , whereas the border determined by the dtea method is shown in black . the border detection errors with respect to the red , green , and blue borders calculated using the xor measure are 10.872% , 9.342% , and 20.958% , respectively .",
    "it can be concluded that , with respect to the first two dermatologists , the dtea method has an average accuracy ( see table  [ tab_xor ] ) . on the other hand , with respect to the third dermatologist ,",
    "the automatic method is quite inaccurate .",
    "the npri value in this case is 0.814 , which is above the average over the entire data set ( see table  [ tab_npri ] ) .",
    "this was expected , since this measure does not penalize the automatic border in those regions where dermatologist agreement is low .",
    "sample border detection result ]",
    "in this paper , we evaluated five recent automated border detection methods on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of manual borders as ground - truth .",
    "we proposed the use of an objective measure , the normalized probabilistic rand index , which takes into account variations in the ground - truth .",
    "the results demonstrated that the differences between four of the evaluated border detection methods were in fact smaller than those predicted by the commonly used xor measure .",
    "future work will be directed towards the expansion of the image set and the inclusion of more dermatologists in the evaluations .",
