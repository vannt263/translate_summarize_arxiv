    "these lines of sight were separated by an angular distance @xmath4 , which corresponds to a linear separation in the corona between the two lines of sight , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance to the sun . in the observations reported in @xcite @xmath7 arcseconds and @xmath8 km .",
    "the observations were made when the line of sight to 3c228 passed through the corona at heliocentric distances from @xmath9 .",
    "the technique is illustrated in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the fundamental physical relation used in the technique is expressed by equation ( 3 ) of @xcite @xmath10 where the integral is around an amperian loop through the corona , consisting of the two lines of sight , closed by imaginary line segments which join the two lines of sight , at locations infinitely separated from the corona . in this formula , @xmath11 is a collection of atomic constants which arise in the description of faraday rotation , defined as @xmath12 in si units , @xmath13 is the electron density , @xmath14 is the vector magnetic field in the corona , and @xmath15 is an incremental step around the amperian loop .",
    "use of ampere s law @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) shows that the differential rotation measure @xmath3 is directly related to the current within the amperian loop defined by the two lines of sight .",
    "the transition from the middle to the right term in equation ( 1 ) involves an approximation , in which the position - dependent plasma density in the integrand is replaced by an effective mean density @xmath17 .",
    "this approximation is discussed at length in @xcite , where arguments for its plausibility are presented .    as is the case with ampere s law , the differential faraday rotation measurement provides information on the _ net current _ within the amperian loop . in general , we expect both positive and negative currents to be flowing within the loop .",
    "the electrical current flowing in a given location in the corona could be much larger than that deduced by the arguments above , and contained in equation ( 7 ) of @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the following results from two observing sessions with the very large array radiotelescope .",
    "each session lasted approximately 8 hours .    1 .",
    "in one of the two sessions , there was a confident detection of a @xmath3 event , with a corresponding inferred electrical current of @xmath0 amperes .",

    "although the data from the earlier investigation of @xcite have not been reanalysed in this manner , examination of figure 11 of that paper shows no clear evidence of a @xmath3 event in several more hours of vla observation .",

    "it should be noted that the turbulent current sheet model is based on analytic and numerical solutions of the equations of 2d magnetohydrodynamics , whereas the deterministic model is plausible but ad - hoc .",

    "i consider the possibility that the current sheets are not entirely random , and that there may be some preference for one sign of the current density , probably determined by the polarity of the large - scale coronal field .",
    "the total net current from the sun must obviously be zero . however , it is possible for a net current to exist in a limited region probed by a radio remote sensing measurement .",
    "we assume that the properties of the individual current sheets can be described as previously , so that the equations of section 3.1 up to , and including equation ( 6 ) , are valid .",
    "however , in the present case , there will be a different relationship between the total current @xmath37 and the current of an individual sheet , @xmath18 .",
    "if there is a preference for current sheets of one sign of the current density , we can write @xmath71 where @xmath43 is the number of sheets with positive current within the amperian loop , and @xmath44 is the number of sheets with negative current density .",

    "the expressions for the volumetric heating rate in the two models of the current sheets , equations ( 10 ) and ( 13 ) respectively , appear quite different in form , and it is natural to ask which is the larger for realistic input parameters . in other words ,",
    "given a measurement of @xmath37 , would greater joule heating result if the current were distributed in a random set of turbulent current sheets as described in section 3.1 , or in a set of sheets with predominantly one sign of the current density , as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "let the heating rate expression for a turbulent set of current sheets as given in equation ( 10 ) be noted by @xmath30 , and that due to a systematic set of sheets with preferentially one sign of the current density ( equation ( 13))as @xmath31 .",

    "the precise value of this ratio depends on the circumstances of the observations , as well as the value of @xmath23 .",
    "an estimate of its value in the case of the observations of @xcite is given at the end of the next section .",
    "in what follows , i discuss the case of turbulent current sheets , then briefly note that the conclusions would not be significantly different for the deterministic case .",
    "equation ( 10 ) is now used to estimate the coronal heating rate from turbulent current sheets .",
    "the variables in the last term ( @xmath76 ) are observational parameters and are known .",
    "the calculation will be carried out for the conditions characteristic of the large @xmath3 event of august 16 , 2003 , in which the inferred current was @xmath0 amps .",
    "the line of sight to the radio source had a minimum heliocentric distance of @xmath77 .",
    "coronal plasma properties characteristic of this distance will be used in the calculation below .",
    "a similar analysis at other times in the observations of @xcite , when there were only upper limits to the current , would obviously yield lower values for the joule heating rate .",

    "however , the spitzer resistivity can be derived from fundamental principles , which is not true of other estimates , and it can serve as a lower limit to the true resistivity .",
    "an informal discussion of the possible role of collisionless processes in determining the resistivity is given in section 4 below .",

    "@xmath93 from @xcite would reduce our value of @xmath23 by about a factor of 4 from the estimate of equation ( 17 ) .",
    "a second estimate of the outer scale of coronal turbulence comes from power spectra of fluctuating doppler shifts of a spacecraft transmitter @xcite .",
    "these estimates , which result from measurements rather than plausible theoretical arguments , give outer scales from a few tenths of a solar radius to a solar radius or more at heliocentric distances of @xmath94 .",

    "it is obvious that the factor of 4 smaller value for @xmath23 advocated by @xcite is in more serious disagreement with the observational value of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a resolution of this matter would warrant a paper in its own right , but for the present work we use equation ( 17 ) . as may be seen from the heating rate expression in equation ( 10 )",
    ", lower values of the domain size @xmath23 generate higher values of the heating rate @xmath29 .",

    "this would seem to be both plausible and a good lower limit to what the current sheet thickness can be .",
    "once again , equation ( 10 ) shows that use of a minimum plausible value for @xmath48 leads to an upper limit to the heating rate @xmath29 . to calculate the ion inertial length , the plasma density profile given by equation ( 6 ) of @xcite ( based on radio propagation measurements of the corona ) and the magnetic field model of @xcite are used .",

    "the observed current @xmath102 amps and the separation of the lines of sight @xmath39 is 33,000 km @xcite .",
    "there remains the value for the effective thickness of the plasma along the line of sight .",

    "these papers utilize cgs units , and report heating rates in power per unit mass . the volumetric heating rate given above is then @xmath107 ergs / cm@xmath106/sec , and is converted to a heating rate / unit mass @xmath109 @xmath110 where i have again used the power law density model of equation ( 6 ) of @xcite in obtaining the mass density at @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite calculate heating rates as a function of heliocentric distance .",
    "since their calculations are self - consistent , their heating rates may be considered to be those which are required by the observed heating of the corona and acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "examination of figure 8 of @xcite shows that the heating rate per unit mass at a heliocentric distance of @xmath112 is in the range of @xmath113 ergs - sec@xmath114-gm@xmath114 , depending on the assumed amplitude of the photospheric velocity fluctuations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the heating rate given by equation ( 10 ) is lower than values which are required to account for coronal heating by at least a factor of @xmath1 , if the input parameters used here are valid .",
    "if the outer scale to the turbulence is a factor of @xmath115 less than the value given by equation ( 17 ) , as recommended by @xcite , the ratio of mass heating rates would be about @xmath116 . in either case",
    ", this huge mismatch means that exercises with fine tuning the parameters in the model would be a fool s errand .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio @xmath117 which appears in equation ( 14 ) is of the order of unity , within a factor of several either larger or smaller depending on the assumed outer scale of the turbulence .",
    "the conclusion on the magnitude of joule heating would not be changed by adopting the non - turbulent current sheet model of section 3.2 .",
    "there are two possible conclusions to be drawn from the calculations of this section .    1 .   in view of the large disparity between the calculated joule heating rate and that which is required for a significant contribution to the thermodynamics of the corona , the currents which may have been observed are irrelevant for coronal heating .",
    "this argument would seem to be strengthened by the fact that i used the largest detected value of @xmath37 from the two days of observation .",
    "other intervals would have provided smaller values for @xmath37 or upper limits thereto , yielding smaller values of @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   a more likely explanation , in my opinion ,",
    "is that these current systems do play an important role in coronal heating , but that role is underestimated in the calculations presented here , because they are based on the spitzer resistivity . according to this viewpoint , the analysis of sections 3.1 and 3.2 is valid , but a correct calculation would require an appropriate , and much larger value of the resistivity .",
    "this is clearly speculation until it can be demonstrated that a much larger resistivity ( by orders of magnitude ) characterizes the coronal plasma at @xmath118 .",
    "in this section , i consider the second of the possibilities listed immediately above , i.e. that the resistivity could be sufficiently enhanced in these coronal current sheets to make joule heating a thermodynamically important process .",
    "an obvious way for this to happen is a plasma instability that produces high levels of fluctuating electric or magnetic fields , which scatter the current - carrying electrons and enhance the resistivity . to assess this possibility",
    ", we need to examine the magnitude of the electron drift speed within the current sheets .",
    "equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) give the relationship between the observed current in the amperian loop , @xmath37 , and the current in a single sheet , @xmath18 . using these equations and the identity immediately before equation ( 6 ) , we have for the current density in a single sheet @xmath119 and for the electron drift speed @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the fundamental electric charge . to simplify equation ( 22 ) i adopt a set of plausible assumptions .",
    "i assume that the width of a current sheet will be some fraction of the domain size , @xmath122 with @xmath25 probably having a value between 0.1 and 0.5 . from section 3 , we already have estimates of other parameters ( e.g. @xmath48 , @xmath22 , @xmath123 ) in equation ( 21 ) at the fiducial heliocentric distance of @xmath77 .",
    "this yields the following estimate for the electron drift speed , @xmath124    for this expression to be meaningful in the context of plasma instabilities , we need to compare it with a characteristic plasma speed . an obvious choice is the electron thermal speed @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "i use a value of @xmath126 k , which is characteristic of closed - magnetic - field regions in the corona .",
    "open field regions would have a lower temperature and lower thermal speed .",
    "we then have for the drift speed to thermal speed ratio @xmath127    as mentioned in the definition of @xmath25 immediately above , and the discussion of @xmath42 in section 3 , @xmath25 is a number which is probably less than unity , but not by a large factor , and @xmath42 is an integer which is probably larger than unity , but not much greater .",
    "their product should therefore be of order unity .",
    "this calculation then suggests the plausibility of electron drift speeds of order the thermal speed in these current sheets . if the drift speed is of the order of the electron thermal speed , it is also of order or larger than the ion acoustic speed .",
    "it is necessary to stress that this calculation has contained products of several parameters ( such as @xmath128 , etc ) which are imperfectly known , so the net result presented here is similarly uncertain .",
    "however , the conclusion of this section is that a current - driven instability , which would lead to high levels of fluctuating electric and magnetic fields , is a possibility .",
    "this calculation has also been carried out for the case of `` deterministic '' current sheets discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the details of the calculation are not presented here , but the final result is that the drift - to - thermal speed ratio is somewhat smaller ( a factor of about 0.17 ) , but not enough to alter the qualitative conclusion stated above .",
    "the possible existence of substantial electron drift speeds , comparable to the electron thermal speed , raises the possibility of an interesting observational diagnostic of such current sheets .",
    "@xcite pointed out that an electron distribution carrying a current will have its distribution function distorted in the direction of current flow , and accordingly have a more populated tail than a distribution which carries no current .",
    "this additional tail component makes the plasma more effective at collision excitation of ions to excited states whose energy above the ground state is a few times the electron thermal energy .",
    "@xcite suggested that turbulent current sheets might reveal themselves via enhanced emission line glow as the excited ions radiatively de - excite .",
    "an important parameter determining the intensity of the line radiation is @xmath129 this parameter is approximately equal to the square of the drift speed to thermal speed ratio .",
    "when @xmath130 becomes of the order of a few tenths , the line emission can be substantially enhanced relative to the current - free value ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that @xmath131 for turbulence in the interstellar medium , so turbulent enhancement of emission line radiation probably does not occur there .",
    "however , the results presented in this section suggest that this mechanism is much more likely to occur in the solar corona .      a complete discussion of the consequences of a current - driven plasma instability for the resistivity within coronal current sheets is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "i will only briefly refer to some results in the literature which indicate the effect may be significant .",
    "the issue of instabilities due to high electron drift speeds was discussed in @xcite , who cited results from @xcite .",
    "the remarks made there are still relevant to the present discussion .",
    "the summary of the work of @xcite presented in @xcite is that an electron drift speed greater than @xmath132 could be sufficient for excitation of obliquely - propagating electrostatic ion cyclotron waves .",
    "the role of a current - driven instability in enhanced resistivity was discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a fluid theory to explain observations of laboratory z - pinches which showed these structures to be larger than expected on the basis of theory with a spitzer conductivity .",
    "the unexpectedly large size of z pinches suggested that enhanced transport coefficients were present .",
    "@xcite found that the electron drift speed exceeded the ion acoustic speed in the outer edges of the z pinch .",
    "his results ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) showed that the effective resistivity due to lower hybrid waves could exceed the spitzer resistivity by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "this enhancement is approaching that needed for thermodynamic relevance of coronal currents , as discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "enhanced resistivity has also been hypothesized to play an important role in magnetic reconnection , allowing reconnection to proceed at a faster rate and produce heating of the plasma . @xcite discussed experiments showing the presence of magnetic fluctuations within the reconnection current sheet on the mrx experiment .",
    "@xcite identify these fluctuations as obliquely - propagating waves arising due to a cross - field current which has a drift speed exceeding the alfvn speed .",
    "@xcite found an enhancement of the resistivity , estimated from the wave force on the electrons , which exceeds the spitzer resistivity by a factor of several .",
    "the relatively modest enhancement of the resistivity relative to that required for coronal relevance , or the results discussed by @xcite , can be attributed to the nearly collisional dynamics of the mrx experiment .",
    "the discussion in @xcite has recently been superceded by the results of @xcite , who now favor perpendicularly - propagating , unstable waves which nonlinearly couple to magnetosonic waves .",
    "it is the magnetosonic waves which determine the resistivity .",
    "this anomalous resistivity is higher than estimated in @xcite .",
    "the above - cited studies are not intended to correspond in detail to the case of joule heating of the solar corona and the highly enhanced resistivity that would be required there .",
    "the investigations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are of importance in showing that current filaments with drift speeds comparable to or exceeding the ion acoustic speed can produce wave and turbulence fields that substantially enhance the resistivity .",
    "current sheets or filaments with drift speeds approaching the electron thermal speed would be even more subject to instability , and to a wider range of unstable modes .    a final point to be considered in this section",
    "is whether the resistivity in the coronal current sheets could plausibly reach levels necessary for important joule heating .",
    "the arguments in the previous paragraphs have shown that current - driven instabilities could quite plausibly be present , but could they enhance the resistivity by several orders of magnitude ?",
    "a very general expression for the resistivity is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a collision frequency of some sort .",
    "if collisionless scattering of electrons determines the resistivity , @xmath134 could be as large as the frequency of a high frequency plasma mode . in what follows",
    ", i choose the lower hybrid frequency @xmath135 in this identity , @xmath97 and @xmath136 are , respectively , the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies .",
    "i use the lower hybrid frequency as a proxy for a plasma mode frequency which is above the ion cyclotron frequency , and do not claim that the unstable waves in coronal current sheets are necessarily lower hybrid waves . in support of this approach , @xcite presents estimates of the anomalous collision frequency which are of order @xmath137 , with a multiplicative constant dependent on the drift speed to ion acoustic speed ratio ( see equation ( 2 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "using the coronal magnetic field model of @xcite , we estimate a lower hybrid frequency @xmath138 khz at a heliocentric distance @xmath139 .",
    "substitution of this collision frequency into equation ( 25 ) ( again using the same estimate of the electron density @xmath123 used in equation ( 22 ) ) gives an anomalous resistivity of 6.27 ohm - m .",
    "this exceeds the spitzer resistivity calculated following equation ( 16 ) by approximately 7 orders of magnitude .",
    "this enhancement in the resistivity is comparable to , and in fact exceeds , the factor by which our calculated heating rate must be increased in order to be relevant for the thermodynamics of the corona @xcite .",
    "this brief calculation then suggests that self - enhanced resistivity in coronal current sheets could lead to thermodynamically - relevant levels of joule heating in the corona .    1",
    ".   radioastronomical observations reported by @xcite are consistent with coronal currents flowing through amperian loops defined by adjacent lines of sight to different components of a radio source .",
    "there are estimates of currents of @xmath0 and @xmath19 amperes , respectively , on two days .",
    "another interval of high quality data on one of the days yielded an upper limit to the differential faraday rotation , and a corresponding upper limit to the current of @xmath140 amperes .",
    "these data are used as input for a calculation of joule heating of the solar corona .",
    "two models are developed to calculate the joule heating associated with the observed currents . in both models ,",
    "the current is envisioned as being in thin , intense current sheets stretched out along the large - scale coronal magnetic field .",
    "the first views the sheets as arising in the evolution of quasi-2d magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "the other assumes that current sheets will arise in the coronal plasma , and could show a preference for one sign of the current density .",
    "these derivations are given in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , and provide the formulas for the volumetric heating rates given in equations ( 10 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "3 .   use of these formulas , with observational data from @xcite and plausible independent coronal data , yield an estimated heating rate of @xmath141 watts / m@xmath106 ( @xmath142 ergs / cm@xmath106/sec in cgs units ) . the corresponding heating rate per unit",
    "mass is @xmath143 ergs / gm / sec .",
    "this appears to be smaller than the level necessary to be significant for coronal heating by at least a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "the conclusion to be drawn from point ( 3 ) is that either these currents are irrelevant for coronal heating , or that the true resistivity in the corona exceeds the spitzer value by several orders of magnitude .",
    "resolution of this matter obviously lies in a better understanding of the resistivity in a collisionless plasma .",
    "the same model used to estimate the volumetric and mass heating rates is also used to estimate the electron drift speed in the current sheets .",
    "this drift speed could be comparable to the electron drift speed , and in excess of the ion acoustic speed .",
    "accordingly , current - driven instabilities might be present in these sheets , and the waves driven unstable by these currents might enhance the resistivity to significant levels .",
    "this contention is supported by works in the literature which have shown enhancement of resistivity by current - driven instabilities .",
