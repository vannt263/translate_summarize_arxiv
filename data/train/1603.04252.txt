    "the study of non - equilibrium dynamics in isolated many - particle systems has become a very active research area in recent years  @xcite .",
    "many review articles have been devoted to various aspects of it  @xcite .",
    "this article focuses on a specific topic which is concerned with the quench dynamics of the luttinger and related models .",
    "even with this constraint in mind , the number of results that have continued to appear since one of us  @xcite studied the quench of the interaction in this model in 2006 is fairly large .",
    "almost a decade has gone by , and with a certain perspective , we have tried to provide a historical and personal account of how some of the ideas developed and what the concerns of the community at the time were .",
    "of course , we have attempted to survey some of the most interesting developments in recent years , while providing a ( hopefully ) pedagogical introduction to the subject .",
    "this has forced us to make many choices in order to render the article as self - contained and coherent as possible .",
    "for this reason , we would like to stress from the beginning that this work is far from perfect and can not be considered comprehensive . when undertaking the task of surveying the field , we have tried our best to overcome our personal biases , however difficult this may be . but as humans facing space and time constraints , we may have ended up leaning towards what we know and understand best .",
    "not surprisingly , this also overlaps strongly with our own work in the field .    nonetheless , we hope that this article will serve as a good starting point ( and even as an inspiration ! ) for those students and non - experts willing learn about this fascinating subject . at the same time , we apologize in advance to all the experts who , after going through the manuscript , find that we did not properly represent the most interesting aspects of their work , or those whose work has been ( unintentionally ) omitted . hopefully some of those mistakes can be corrected in the future . without further ado ,",
    "let us get started .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided in six sections . in the first two",
    ", we deal with the dynamics of the post - quench correlations in sudden and smooth quantum quenches .",
    "section  [ sec : entgge ] discusses the generalized gibbs ensemble describing the asymptotic long - time state following a sudden quench , and its relation to the ideas of quantum entanglement . in section  [ sec : other ]",
    ", we briefly survey some of the results obtained for other models that are related to the luttinger model .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] discusses the relevance of the results for experiments both with quantum gases and in mesoscopic physics .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : summ ] , we provide our conclusions and an outlook . from this point on",
    ", we shall work in units where @xmath0 .",
    "luttinger  @xcite introduced the model that bears his name in 1963 as an example of an exactly solvable model of intreracting spinless fermions .",
    "however , the solution that he obtained for his own the model was not entirely correct , as it was shown shortly thereafter by mattis and lieb  @xcite .",
    "luttinger s assumptions included a linear dispersion for the fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , since such a dispersion can take arbitrarily large negative values , in order to obtain a physically sensible model with a spectrum bounded from below , luttinger had to occupy all single - particle levels with negative kinetic energy with an infinite number of fermions .",
    "in other words , the ground state of luttinger s model is a ` dirac sea ' .",
    "this was quite a departure from the non - relativistic models studied in the theory of quantum many - particle systems up to that point . in those models , such as the gas of interacting fermions with a parabolic dispersion , the single - particle dispersion is bounded from below .",
    "thus , the ground state is a fermi sea containing a finite number of fermions .",
    "by contrast the number of particles in the dirac sea is infinite and luttinger s model is indeed a quantum field theory in disguise .",
    "indeed , in particle physics , the lorentz - invariant version of luttinger s model is known as the thirring model .",
    "the above observations were made by mattis and lieb  @xcite , who emphasized that the dirac - sea character of the ground state has deep consequences for the structure of the hilbert space and its operator content .",
    "in particular , luttinger had used a transformation to map the interacting model onto the non - interacting one  @xcite .",
    "the transformation appears to be canonical but in reality is not  @xcite .",
    "indeed , according to an earlier observation by schwinger  @xcite , the requirement of a dirac sea makes the commutation relation of certain operators , such as the density , non - vanishing i.e. `` anomalous '' .",
    "this happens independently of whether such operators commute in their first quantized form that applies to systems consisting of a finite number of particles .",
    "after discussing the structure of the ( non - interacting ) ground state , let us consider the form of the hamiltonian . in the notation that we shall be following in the rest of the article",
    ", the second quantized hamiltonian can be written as the sum of three terms , i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the kinetic energy of the fermions with linear dispersion : @xmath3\\:.\\ ] ] in this expression @xmath4 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the term @xmath5 describes the interactions : @xmath6 : \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations the operators @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) annihilate ( create ) fermions with momentum @xmath9 and chirality ( i.e direction of motion ) @xmath10 , and obey @xmath11 , anti - commuting otherwise . for use",
    "further below , it is also useful to define the fermi field operator : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "in order to avoid a degenerate ground state , we assume the field operators to obey anti - periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 being an integer .",
    "the normal ordering of the operator @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ground state of the _ non - interacting _ system . in luttinger s original model , the functions @xmath20 , but in modern literature",
    "it has become standard to treat them as different .",
    "it is also assumed that the interactions have a characteristic range , @xmath21 , beyond which the decay to zero in real space . in terms of the fourier components @xmath22 and @xmath23 , this means that these functions rapidly vanish for @xmath24 .",
    "we shall also assume that they are free of singularities as @xmath25 .",
    "it was pointed out by mattis and lieb that the second - quantized density operators @xmath26 satisfy the following algebra  @xcite : @xmath27 =   \\frac{q l}{2\\pi } \\delta_{q+q^{\\prime } } \\delta_{\\alpha\\alpha^{\\prime}}. \\label{eq : km}\\ ] ] in modern literature , this algebra is known as the abelian [ u@xmath28 kac - moody ( km ) algebra .",
    "it was mattis and lieb s realization that the km algebra is the key to the exact solubility of the model .",
    "this is because it is possible to rewrite the km algebra in terms of the operators : @xmath29,\\\\ a^{\\dag}(q ) & =   i \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{|q|l}}\\left [ \\theta(q ) \\rho_{r}(q )   -\\theta(-q )   \\rho_{l}(-q)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath30 = \\delta_{q , q^{\\prime}}$ ] and commute otherwise , as corresponds to canonical bosons .",
    "in addition , mattis and lieb rediscovered an _",
    "exact _ result obtained by jordan  @xcite in the context of his neutrino theory of light , which states that the kinetic energy of the fermions with linear dispersion can be written as : @xmath31 thus , since the interactions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are quadratic in the density operators , which means they are also quadratic in @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we obtain with a quadratic hamiltonian in the bosonic basis , which can be diagonalized by means of a canonical ( bogoliubov ) transformation : @xmath36 where @xmath30   = \\delta_{q , q^{\\prime}}$ ] .",
    "the bogoliubov angle @xmath37 is determined from the equation : @xmath38 therefore , the hamiltonian of the interacting system , @xmath39 , is diagonal in terms of the new bosonic operator basis @xmath40 : @xmath41 where the boson velocity is given by : @xmath42 mattis and lieb s solution of the luttinger model ( lm ) provided the first concrete example of an interacting fermi system exhibiting an excitation spectrum that strongly deviates from landau s normal `` fermi - liquid '' paradigm . the spectrum of the model , as shown in eq .  , consists of collective , plasmon - like , bosonic modes known as tomonaga bosons .",
    "these  _ bosonic _ elementary excitations are quite unlike the fermionic quasi - particles that describe the low - lying states of fermi liquids .",
    "perhaps the most striking signature of the failure of the lm to conform to the framework of normal fermi liquids can be observed in the momentum distribution .",
    "mattis and lieb noticed that , in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. for @xmath43 ) instead of the characteristic discontinuity at the fermi momentum @xmath44 , the momentum distribution of the lm exhibits a much weaker , power - law singularity : @xmath45 for @xmath46 ; the exponent @xmath47 depends on the details of the interaction ; @xmath48 is the single - particle density matrix ( the expectation value @xmath49 is taken over the ground state of the _ interacting _ system ) .",
    "mattis and lieb were able to obtain this result by a method equivalent to bosonization  @xcite . here , we shall recall the main identities and results of this method , referring the interested reader to the vast available literature on the subject  @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the following identity : @xmath50 this allows to express the fermi fields in terms of the boson field ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a short distance cut - off and @xmath54 , which ensures the anti - commutation between fermions of different chirality .",
    "the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 are a canonically conjugate pair ( i.e. @xmath57 = i \\delta_{\\alpha,\\alpha^{\\prime}}$ ] ) .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59},\\\\   z^{\\mathrm{gs}}(x ) & =   \\left(\\frac{r}{d(x|l)}\\right)^{\\gamma^2_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expressions , @xmath60 is the _ non - interacting _ single - particle density matrix and @xmath61 the _ cord _ function and @xmath62 is the equilibrium exponent that has been introduced under eq .   above .",
    "another correlation function of interest is the density correlation function . in terms of the boson field , the density operator @xmath63  @xcite , and therefore @xmath64 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which also exhibits an algebraic decay with distance , but with a exponent that is independent of the interaction ( although the pre - factor is not ) .",
    "as pointed out by mattis and lieb  @xcite , the solution of the lm shares many interesting properties with the approximate solution of the one - dimensional electron gas obtained by tomonaga  @xcite in 1950 .",
    "the striking resemblance was to become more and more important in the course of time .",
    "indeed , after luttinger s and mattis and lieb s seminal contributions , the exotic properties of the model turned out to be more than a just a mathematical curiosity . beginning in the 1970s , the study of one - dimensional interacting systems started to attract an increasingly large amount of attention motivated by the advances in materials synthesis and spurred by little s proposal  @xcite for a new class of organic high - temperature superconductors based on highly anisotropic materials made up of quasi - one dimensional metallic molecules .",
    "ground breaking work along in this direction was done by luther and emery  @xcite by extending the luttinger model to spinful fermions and finding that , when backscattering processes are taken into account , the system develops spectral gap to spin excitations but remains gapless for charge excitations .",
    "such system , currently known as the luther - emery liquid , is the canonical example of a one - dimensional superconductor .",
    "in addition , luther in collaboration with peschel  @xcite provided the first crucial insights into the fundamental observation that the low - temperature behavior of the lm is universal and applies to a general class of 1d models . building upon the earlier work by luther and peschel on the anisotropic heisenberg xyz spin - chain model , and in the spirit of landau s ferm liquid theory ,",
    "haldane  @xcite coined the name `` luttinger liquids '' for this new universality class , which encompasses a large class of one - dimensional models of fermions  @xcite , bosons  @xcite , and spins  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the language of the renormalization group  @xcite , the lm turns out to be a fixed point hamiltonian for this universality class .",
    "the fixed point hamiltonian of a tll can be written in terms of the ( total ) density @xmath65 and phase @xmath66 , as follows : @xmath67 ,   \\label{eq : tllham}\\ ] ] where the tomonaga boson velocity is @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : veloc ] ) , the so - called luttinger parameter is @xmath69 in terms of bogoliubov rotation angle at @xmath70 ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : bogolangle ] ) .",
    "note that the density stiffness is proportional to @xmath71 and the phase stiffness is related to @xmath72 . in galilean - invariant systems",
    "@xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the particle density  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "can be diagonalized and brought to a form similar to eq .  , with @xmath75 replaced by @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the low - energy excitation spectrum is completely exhausted by the tomonaga bosons . in recognition to tomonaga s pioneering contributions , the universality class has been renamed as  tomonaga - luttinger liquids ( tlls ) .",
    "the defining properties of the systems in the tll universality class are a linear dispersion of the tomonaga bosons , and the power - law correlations at zero temperature .",
    "the exponents of the power - laws are parametrized by @xmath77 .",
    "notice that the previous observations apply to systems for which the interactions at @xmath70 are not singular , which implies that both @xmath78 and @xmath77 are finite as @xmath79 .",
    "this is not the case when the interactions are long range such like the case of the coulomb interation .",
    "we refer the interested reader to e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) for an account of how the correlations are modified in this case .",
    "in 2006 , one of us ( mac ) attended a workshop at the max planck institute for complex systems in dresden .",
    "the workshop , co - organized by alejandro mumamatsu , was devoted to non - equilibrium dynamics in interacting systems . at the workshop , rigol reported on the results of his ground - breaking work with dunjko , yurovskii , and olshanii , motivated by experiments performed in weiss group  @xcite . in their work ,",
    "rigol and coworkers showed that gas of lattice hardcore bosons in 1d ( also known as the xx model ) does not thermalize to the standard gibbs ensemble when prepared in an initial state that is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian . in their study , they provided convincing numerical evidence that the system instead relaxes to a ` generalized ' gibbs ensemble , which is constructed by using a particular set of integrals of motion of the system ( see section  [ sec : entgge ] for a description ) .    following rigol s report at the workshop , ensuing discussions with muramatsu and rigol provided enough motivation for one of us ( mac ) to search for an analytically - solvable example of such peculiar behavior . out of the several possible candidates ,",
    "the luttinger model seemed the most natural choice .",
    "however , several obstacles had to be surmounted . in rigol _",
    "_ s work , two kinds of initial states had been considered : in one of them , it was assumed the hardcore boson gas is initially trapped in a smaller box and suddenly released into a larger box .",
    "the second choice was motivated by one of the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and considered that a bi - periodic potential is applied in the initial state of the lattice boson gas and suddenly switched off at start of the evolution  @xcite .",
    "neither of the above choices of initial states considered seemed analytically tractable in the case of the lm because they break translational invariance ( however , see remarks at the end of section  [ subsec : lmep ] ) . instead , what seemed most natural and amenable to analytical calculation was to assume that the interaction between the fermions , described by the terms @xmath5 in the hamiltonian , is suddenly switched - on at the start of the time evolution .",
    "an attractive feature of such a quench is that the eigenstates of the non - interacting system can be still described in terms of fermionic eigenmodes . on the other hand ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath80 are described in terms of tomonaga bosons .",
    "thus , the quench of the interaction allows to study how the fermionic features of the spectrum are dynamically destroyed .    assuming that the system is prepared in the non - interacting ground state , @xmath81 and it evolves according to @xmath82 for all times @xmath83 is equivalent to a _ quantum quench _ of the interaction .",
    "the term `` quantum quench '' was introduced by cardy and calabrese  @xcite in their 2006 pioneering work ( see also this volume ) where they studied the evolution of correlations when the system is suddenly driven from a off - critical to a critical state .",
    "the main difference with situation considered by cardy and calabrese is that the initial state in ref .",
    "@xcite lacks any characteristic length scale , i.e. it is a critical state .",
    "the solution of the quench of the interaction in the lm can be obtained with minimal use of formalism in the operator language .",
    "the solution takes the form of a canonical transformation relating the bosonic operators at times @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 where the time - dependent ( bogoliubov ) coefficients read : @xmath87 note that @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in agreement with the initial state of the system being the non - interacting ground state , @xmath19 , which is annihilated by @xmath34 for all @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , eq .   shows that the time evolution with the interacting hamiltonian @xmath91 alters , in a time - dependent way , the entanglement of the modes at opposite momenta @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which is a consequence of the translational invariance of both the hamiltonian and the initial state .",
    "we shall return to this point in section  [ sec : entgge ] .",
    "distribution of the luttinger model in the neighborhood of the fermi momentum , @xmath44 , following a quench of the interaction .",
    "the non - equilibrium exponent @xmath94 , where @xmath77 is the luttinger parameter , which parametrizes the correlations in the ground state , is different from the equilibrium exponent , @xmath95 ]    in order to obtain the time evolution of correlations from the initial ( non - interacting ) state and study how the fermionic features of the non - interacting lm are wiped out , let us consider the instantaneous single - particle density matrix  @xcite : @xmath96 which can be computed using the bosonization formula , eq .  , together with eq .  .",
    "the calculation proceeds pretty much along the lines of the calculation in the equilibrium case  @xcite , and yields the following result in the scaling limit ( i.e. for @xmath97 ) : @xmath98^{\\gamma^2 } \\left[\\frac{d(x-2vt|l ) d(x+2vt|l)}{d(2vt ) } \\right]^{\\gamma^2/2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] likewise , we can obtain the density correlations : @xmath99 ^ 2 }    - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\left[d(x-2vt|l ) \\right]^2 } -   \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\left[d(x+2vt|l ) \\right]^2}\\right\\}. \\label{eq : rhor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the avobe expressions @xmath76 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the luttinger parameter .",
    "note that since the correlation functions are periodic functions of time and will exhibit periodic recurrences with a period @xmath102 .",
    "this is the consequence of the finite size of the system . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath103 , and therefore @xmath104",
    "thus , the cord functions yield power - laws by the replacement @xmath105 .    for @xmath103 ( or for @xmath106 ) , the behavior of the above correlation functions exhibits two clearly distinct regimes . at short times , i.e. for @xmath107 , @xmath108 that is , the correlations take a similar form to those of the non - interacting system . in the case of the single - particle density matrix , it decreases by an overall factor @xmath109 . on the other hand , in the long time regime ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath110 , the correlations crossover to @xmath111 in this case , the correlations become qualitatively different from the initial state correlations . in particular , to leading order , they do not depend on time , which indicates that for @xmath112 the system reaches a steady state .",
    "we shall investigate this behavior more in detail further below , in section  [ sec : entgge ] .",
    "however , at this point , it is worth pointing out that the existence of the two distinct correlation regimes separated by a time scale @xmath113 has to do with the finite propagation velocity of the elementary excitations of the lm .",
    "since the lm is a relativistic model in which the role of the speed of light is played by the boson velocity @xmath78 , this can be expected .",
    "the time scale @xmath114 is thus related to the time it takes for the excitations in the initial state localized at two points a distance @xmath115 apart to overlap .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed light - cone effect by cardy and calabrese  @xcite in their study of quantum quenches starting from an off - critical state and ending in a critical state . in a more general framework , it is the consequence of the lieb - robison - type bounds  @xcite for propagation of signals in systems with finite - range interactions .",
    "the correlations in the steady state are different from those of the initial state and from those in the ground state of the lm . despite the fact that the initial state is a complicated superposition of eigenstates of @xmath91 , the correlations are not thermal .",
    "if they were , they would exhibit an exponential decay beyond a characteristic length scale determined by the final ( effective ) temperature of the system @xmath116 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references ) . to see this ,",
    "let us consider an `` infinitesimal '' quench in which an very weak interaction ( i.e. @xmath117 ) is switched on .",
    "thus , the energy of the initial state differs from the energy of the lm ground state ( taken to be zero ) by an infinitesimal amount , @xmath118 which means that only low - lying excited states should be involved in the evolution following the quench .",
    "thus , we can use the low - temperature form of the free energy in the canonical gibbs ensemble for the lm ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the corresponding final temperature , @xmath120 . however , this is still finite , which means that , if the system relaxes to the canonical gibbs ensemble , the correlations should decay exponentially at long distances  @xcite , e.g. : @xmath121 for @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "by contrast , the asymptotic @xmath124 state following the quantum quench exhibits power - law correlations , as we have shown above .",
    "in other words , the system does not thermalize to the canonical gibbsian ensemble .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : entgge ] that this is because the lm is exactly solvable and relaxes instead to a generalized gibbs ensemble .",
    "before discussing the properties of the asymptotic state , let us discuss the consequences of the above results for the evolution of the momentum distribution . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : history ] , the latter is the fourier transform of the equilibrium single - particle density matrix . by analogy , we can define the instantaneous momentum distribution , @xmath125 the results on the left - hand side hold for @xmath46 . fig .",
    "[ fig : fpt ] shows the evolution of the momentum distribution schematically .",
    "the discontinuity at the fermi momentum @xmath44 decreases algebraically and closes for @xmath126 becoming a weaker , power - law singularity , with an exponent that differs from the exponent characterizing the discontinuity at @xmath44 in the ground state .",
    "additional post - quench correlation functions were obtained by iucci and cazalilla in ref .",
    "@xcite . we just quote here their results for the correlations of the so - called vertex operators starting from the non - interacting ground state . for the ratio of the non - equilibrium to the initial state correlations , the following results hold in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an integer . in the above expressions  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath129 notice that the usual equilibrium duality relations requiring that if @xmath130 then @xmath131 also hold for the post - quench correlations . besides the above results , iucci and cazalilla also studied correlations at finite temperature , obtaining the momentum distribution in the asymptotic steady state at @xmath124 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a quantum quench in which the interactions are suddenly switched off was also studied .",
    "we refer the interested reader to section ii .-",
    "c of ref .",
    "@xcite for the detailed form of the post - quench correlations in this case .    in the derivation of the previous results",
    ", it has been assumed that the interactions are long ranged but not singular .",
    "this translates into @xmath22 and @xmath23 being regular functions of @xmath92 as @xmath79 , which is necessary to ensure that @xmath77 and @xmath78 are both finite .",
    "this is not the case for the coulomb interaction for which @xmath132 . here",
    "@xmath133 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential , @xmath134 being the modified bessel function and @xmath135 a length scale of the order of the transverse dimensions system ( recall that @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is euler s constant ) .",
    "the post - quench correlations for the lm with coulomb interactions have been obtained by nessi and iucci  @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we reproduce here their results for the single - particle density matrix , specializing to the case of a quench from the non - interacting system ( which corresponds to setting @xmath138 in their expressions ) .",

    "asymptotic expressions can be obtained from eq .  .",
    "for instance , the asymptotic long time limit reads  @xcite : @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 being the fundamental fermion charge .",
    "this form again differs from the equilibrium expression  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate time dynamics , however , is complicated by the divergence of the tomonaga boson velocity @xmath75 as @xmath79 , which leads to a non - linear light - cone effect  @xcite .",
    "thus , for times fulfilling the condition : @xmath148 the single - particle density matrix takes the form : @xmath149 with exponential accuracy .",
    "hence , it follows that the discontinuity at @xmath44 in momentum distribution decreases as @xmath150 instead of the power - law @xmath151 found for the lm with non - singular interactions .",
    "asymptotic forms for other post - quench correlations , such as those of vertex operators , were also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer the interested reader to the original article for the details .      in the previous subsection , we have reviewed the results obtained for a sudden quench of the interaction in the lm . since sudden quenches",
    "can potentially drive the system far from equilibrium , there is no reason to expect that the results discussed above can be universal .",
    "indeed , universality applies to the low - temperature , long distance and time correlations of systems in _ equilibrium _ and it is borne out on the ideas of the renormalization group  @xcite . according to the latter , the low - temperature properties of a system are rather insensitive to the microscopic details as it is the structure of the low - lying excited states .",
    "therefore , a sudden quantum quench that involves highly excited states is not likely to yield correlations that are universal .",
    "nevertheless , since lm is a renormalization - group fixed point for the tomonaga - luttinger liquid universality class , there is much interest in investigating to which extent correlations following a sudden quench exhibit universality .",
    "analytical progress in this regard is particularly difficult .",
    "therefore , in order to ascertain whether the correlations are independent or not of the microscopic details of the model , a number of numerical and semi - numerical techniques have been deployed .",
    "in particular , the lm prediction for the dynamics of the discontinuity at @xmath44 in the momentum distribution reviewed in the pervious section , has been numerically tested by karrasch , rentrop , schuricht , and meden ( krsm )  @xcite using time - dependent dmrg  @xcite .",

    "as we discuss in this section , it also provides an excellent playground to understand the emergence of the generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) as an effective description of the correlations in the steady state ofollowing the quantum quench .    in order to gain a broader perspective ,",

    "rigol and coworkers noticed that dynamics of integrable models is strongly constrained by the presence of a large number of integrals of motion , @xmath341 ( @xmath342 = 0 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the post - quench hamiltonian ) .",

    "in such a case , the lagrange multipliers @xmath345 correspond to the familiar inverse absolute temperature @xmath346 and the ratio of ( minus ) the chemical potential to the absolute temperature , @xmath347 .",
    "however , in general , as it is the case of integrable systems , the set of conserved quantities is larger than @xmath348 , and more @xmath345 are required .",
    "the latter are determined from the initial conditions by requiring that @xmath349 where @xmath74 is the density matrix describing the initial state .",
    "rigol and coworkers have provided convincing numerical evidence for the gge by performing a careful numerical analysis of several types of quenches in the lattice hardcore bose gas  @xcite . for this system , they identified  @xcite the set of integrals of motion @xmath341 to be the occupation operators of the eigenmodes of the system , which are the occupations of the jordan - wigner fermions in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an analytical proof that the gge describes the correlations in the asymptotic state of the quenched lm model was provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "yet , the effectiveness of the gge description must be regarded as something rather non - obvious and even striking .",
    "it is striking that a density matrix corresponding to a mixed state can describe the result of the unitary evolution of a pure state such as the ground state of the non - interacting lm  .",
    "it is also not obvious that the number of integrals of motion required to construct the gge is only a particular subset of all the possible integrals of motion of the model .",
    "some answers to these questions can be extracted from the theory of quantum entanglement .",
    "as we have seen above , quantum entanglement plays a important role in the physics of quantum quenches . the light - cone effect described in section  [ sec : corrdyn ]",
    "can be traced back to the propagation of entangled pairs of quasi - particles .",
    "in addition , we will see below that the gge emerges as a consequence of decoherence caused by the time evolution which erases all but a certain kind of correlations that exist amongst the eigenmodes in the initial state of the system .",
    "this observation is applicable to a certain class of initial states , known as gaussian states , which are defined further below in this section .",
    "however , before discussing the connections between the gge and entanglement , it is worth providing a short pedagogical introduction to the most important concepts of entanglement theory , which is undertaken in the following section .",
    "entanglement is one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics .",
    "it was introduced by schrdinger when he used the german word ",

    "as mentioned above , entanglement can also be applied to gain deeper understanding of quench dynamics , and in particular , the emergence of the gge .",

    "thus , we can regard the effective temperature @xmath431 for the eigenmodes with @xmath92 as the result of their quantum correlations with the @xmath93 eigenmodes and vice versa .",

    "if the translational - invariance constraint is relaxed , dephasing will still erase the off diagonal correlations , not only the `` anomalous '' ones @xmath432 but also the normal ones @xmath433 ( @xmath387 ) because they always appear in the correlators multiplied by phase factors of the form @xmath434| t}$ ] , which oscillate very rapidly for @xmath435 and therefore yield a vanishing contribution .",
    "this is essentially the reason why the gge is so effective for describing the asymptotic state correlations .",

    "how this happens and what kind of perturbations to the lm drive such thermalization is still very much under debate ( although a number of important results have emerged recently , see below ) .",
    "a first attempt to understand how terms that have been neglected by the use of tll fixed - point ( i.e. the lm ) hamiltonian to describe the quench dynamics was undertaken by mitra and giamarchi  @xcite . using the non - equilibrium green s function ( keldysh ) formalism , and assuming that a non - linearity in the form of a sine - gordon term ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : sg ] ) is adiabatically switched - on following an interaction quench , they showed that the system would eventually reach a thermal state . in other words ,",
    "the coupling between the eigenmodes due to the sine - gordon term introduces quasi - particle scattering that violates the infinite conservation laws of the lm and relaxes the system to a thermal state .",
    "nevertheless , intrinsic sources of scattering between quasi - particles are present in most models of the tll class at all times .",
    "one of them is the curvature in the fermion dispersion , which  in bosonized form reads  @xcite : @xmath523 the effects on the post - quench dynamics of the _ resonant _ scattering of tomonaga bosons caused by eq .",
    "[ eq : curv ] have been recently addressed by buchhold , heyl , and diehl ( bhd )  @xcite . by using non - equilibrium green s functions",
    ", bhd wrote a quantum kinetic equation for the tomonaga bosons in the presence of collisions mediated by the eq .  .",
    "from the numerical solution of the kinetic equation , the following picture for the fermion single - particle correlation function emerges : besides the two regimes that have been discussed in section  [ sec : dyn ] , which are called pre - quench and pre - thermal by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , a new regime , termed ` thermal ' appears . in the thermal regime",
    ", @xmath139 exhibits an exponential decay with distance .",
    "thus , summarizing bhd s results for a quench of the interaction starting from the non - interacting ground state , the following three distinct regimes exist : @xmath524 } & t >",
    "t_{\\mathrm{th}}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in the pre - quench regime ( i.e. for @xmath525 ) , correlations are only multiplicatively modified from their initial state values .",
    "the pre - thermalized regime corresponds to @xmath526 . in this regime , the dynamics is controlled by the exactly solvable truncation of the total hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath91 . in this regard",
    ", @xmath91 plays a similar role to the exactly solvable truncation of the interacting 2d fermi gas discussed in section  [ sec : pretherm ] .",
    "in other words , the exactly solvable models describe a regime of ` inertial response ' to the quench of the interaction , in which quasi - particles are formed before they can start to scatter each other .",
    "the final ( `` thermal '' ) regime is takes places for @xmath527 .",
    "the thermalization time @xmath528 , where @xmath529 and @xmath530 are functions of the luttinger parameter , @xmath77 , that need to be determined numerically  @xcite ( @xmath21 is the interaction range , which effectively plays the role of momentum cut - off , see section  [ sec : history ] ) .",
    "the curvature , eq .  , leads to the emergence of a new time scale in the problem @xmath531 , where @xmath532 is the strength of the interaction - vertex arising from eq .  .",
    "bhd also pointed that the existence of the thermalized regime and the different scaling of the time ( or equivalently , length ) scales that determine them , implies the existence of a minimum time or distance below which the pre - thermalized behavior can not be observed .",
    "this distance , @xmath533 is found by equating @xmath534  @xcite and hence @xmath535 , and @xmath536 the quasi - particles with short wavelength have not formed before they begin to scatter each other .",
    "thus , below this length scale the system correlations will behave either as in the pre - quench or in the thermal regime .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that the thermal regime is a stationary state only asymptotically .",
    "this is because the correlation length @xmath537 = k/(1+k^2 ) \\left(v/\\pi t(t)\\right ) $ ] , where the effective temperature @xmath538 , where @xmath376 is the final temperature of the system , @xmath539 is a parameter that is determined numerically , and the exponent @xmath540  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , the experimental realization that was envisaged was a quantum quench in a dipolar fermi gas effectively confined to one dimension in a very anisotropic trap  .",
    "however , cooling fermi gases to temperatures well below the fermi temperature , @xmath541 , is technically difficult , although some progress has been recently reported in the case of dipolar fermi gases due to their long - ranged interactions  @xcite .",
    "currently , the lowest temperatures attainable are @xmath542 of @xmath541 .",
    "thus , even if the dynamics of trapped ultracold gases can be studied for quite some time due to their isolated nature making it extremely quantum coherent , finite temperature effects must be accounted for when comparing with the experiment .",
    "such effects were theoretically addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the momentum distribution , with the conclusion that the latter is probably not the most ideal observable to study quench dynamics . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reason are the rather small differences between the non - equilibrium steady state momentum distribution and the interacting finite temperature momentum distribution may be hard to discern experimentally .",
    "let us recall that the , at finite temperatures , the discontinuity in momentum distribution is absent due to entropic effects . in addition , the discontinuity is also very sensitive to other effects , such as inhomogeneity , finite - size , etc .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that not all finite - temperature effects are perverse . indeed ,",
    "if the initial state is a finite temperate state @xmath543 , then the steady state is reached much faster , @xmath544  @xcite , rather than for @xmath126 .",
    "cooling problems are less severe for ultracold atomic gases of bosons , and therefore much more progress has been made in studying the non - equilibrium dynamics of such systems .",
    "in fact , using a trapped 1d cloud of bosons that suddenly is split longitudinally into two 1d clouds , it has been possible to observe pre - thermalization  @xcite and also find strong evidence for relaxation to the generalized gibbs ensemble ( in the pre - thermalized regime )  @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , to some extent , these experiments can be interpreted in terms of a quench in a sine - gordon model that is dual to the one in eq .",
    ", i.e. with the replacement @xmath545  @xcite . in the experiment , the field @xmath546 corresponds to relative phase between the two atomic clouds and the coupling @xmath491 , which describes the josephson tunneling between the two clouds , is suddenly quenched from a large to a zero value .",
    "in other words , the quench proceeds from the gapped to the gapless phase of the sine - gordon model .",
    "since the initial ( josephson ) coupling @xmath547 is large due to the initial complete overlap of the two clouds , and the atoms in the 1d clouds are weakly interacting , the harmonic approximation where @xmath548 is a good starting point  @xcite .",
    "thus , the quench can be described by a quadratic model and a gaussian initial state , and it is therefore expected to relax to the gge , as we have discussed in section  [ sec : entgge ] . in the experiment , the post - quench correlations of the ( relative )",
    "phase are measured by letting the two atomic clouds interfere after releasing them from the trap  @xcite .",
    "quantum hall state of a 2d electron gas subject to a magnetic field . ]      despite being ultracold atomic gases a major motivation for the study of quantum quenches and non - equilibrium dynamics , it may appear as somewhat striking to some that , some of the above theoretical ideas have found faster applications in the realm of mesoscopic systems of electrons .",
    "however , when subjected to intense magnetic fields and low temperatures , the `` dirty '' 2d gases of interacting electrons in the quantum hall regime have been for some time the arena for many experiments that have reached the precision standards of atomic physics in interferometry@xcite , for instance .",
    "chirality arising from the application of the magnetic field makes the edges of the 2d electron gas in the _ integer _ quantum hall regime behave as clean , non - interacting , conducting channels as far as the transport at small voltage bias is concerned .",
    "this is manifested in the perfect conductance quantization of the latter in units of @xmath549 , which can be experimentally observed at low temperatures .",
    "however , this does not mean that the ( screened ) coulomb interaction can be neglected .",
    "coulomb interaction is indeed important to account for the spectral properties of the channels .",
    "furthermore , its effect is especially felt when driving the system out of equilibrium . in this",
    "regard , kovrizhin and chalker  @xcite first pointed out the interesting analogies between the study of the relaxation mechanisms of integer quantum hall interferometers and the interaction quench in the lm . in this section , we shall closely follow the work of milletar and rosenow  @xcite , which has also found recent experimental confirmation  @xcite .    using a hall bar device like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] at landau - level filling @xmath550 , it is possible to prepare a double - step non - equilibrium distribution for the fermions in the outer edge channel ( denoted by @xmath551 in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) .",
    "mathematically , @xmath552 where @xmath553 and @xmath554 ( @xmath555 ) , and @xmath556 .",
    "the initial state corresponding to the above distribution is prepared by taking the outer channel @xmath551 , which comes from a reservoir at chemical potential @xmath557 through the first quantum point contact ( qpc1 ) . at this contact",
    ", the channel is brought in close contact with its grounded left - moving partner at the other edge of the hall bar , which allows for local tunneling of electrons with different chemical potentials between the two . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "this results in the distribution function displayed in eq .  .",
    "after being driven out of equilibrium , channel @xmath551 is allowed to relax by interacting downstream with the grounded inner channel @xmath558 in the shaded region of fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "chirality implies that time and space play the same role and the spatial overlap of the two channels in this region can be regarded as sudden quench of their mutual interaction . in the interaction region",
    "the channels are described by the ( ` post - quench ' ) hamiltonian : @xmath559 which can be diagonalized by means of the canonical transformation @xmath560 and @xmath561 .",
    "the @xmath546 is the mixing angle , which is determined from @xmath562 , where @xmath563 parametrizes the ( screened coulomb ) interaction between the two channels and @xmath564 and @xmath565 are the outer and inner channel velocities , respectively .",
    "note that the appearance of trigonometric functions here ( instead of the hyperbolic functions of the previous sections ) is due to the same ( right - moving ) chirality of the two coupled fermionic channels .",
    "nevertheless , as in the case of the lm , a solution of the quench dynamics can be obtained by means of the following time - dependent canonical transformation : @xmath566 where @xmath567 the parameters @xmath568 are the eigenmode velocities .     in the inner channel @xmath558 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) vs. the mixing angle @xmath546 , which measures the strength of the inter - channel interaction .",

    "[ fig : device ] ) .",
    "the dots in both figures correspond to the numerical results obtained from the theory of ref .",
    "the dashed line is a simple model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which @xmath572 . the shaded ( blue ) area represents the best fit with the error of @xmath573 based on the fitted exponent @xmath569 . ]    after spatially overlapping , the two channels @xmath551 and @xmath558 are again spatially separated in order to probe the inner channel @xmath558 by taking it through a second quantum point contact at qpc2 .",
    "there , it comes into contact with its left - moving partner before reaching ground together with outer channel ( cf .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) . the shot noise in this channel is thus measured at contact number @xmath574   ( cf .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , shot noise measures the ( fractional ) charge of the carriers and can be obtained from the single - particle green s function of the channel ( @xmath575 ) : @xmath576 through the expression : @xmath577\\ ] ] where @xmath578 is the tunneling amplitude at the second point contact , qpc2 .",
    "the green s function of the inner upstream channel can be written as follows : @xmath579 where @xmath580 a_{1r}(q)$ ] and @xmath53 is a short - distance cut - off of the order of the magnetic length .",
    "the calculation of @xmath581 is complicated by non - gaussianity of the initial state , which yields the double - step distribution of eq .  .",
    "however , it can be still expressed in terms of a fredholm determinant of the toeplitz type and evaluated numerically  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the steady state are accessed by taking the limit @xmath126 in the above green s function .",
    "the resulting steady state is not thermal  @xcite , which is a consequence of the constrained dynamics of the model .",
    "the shot noise can be then extracted from the steady state green s function .",
    "the so - called fano factor , corresponding to the ratio @xmath582 where @xmath583 ( @xmath584 is the reflection probability at the second quantum point contact  @xcite , and @xmath585 is the voltage bias ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inue_exp ] as a function of the mixing angle , @xmath546 .",
    "the experimental determination of its value ( with the corresponding error bars ) is indicated by the shaded ( blue ) region .",
    "having the opportunity to write this article has taught us that the subject of quantum quenches in the luttinger and related models continues to enjoy tremendous vitality after ten years .",
    "there are plenty of new analytical results , often obtained by the combination of powerful techniques which include conformal field theory , bethe - ansatz , non - equilibrium ( keldysh ) green s functions , etc .",
    "in addition , powerful numerical methods have been applied to various models and are teaching us where the analytics can be ( and can not be ) applied .",
    "nevertheless , a deeper understanding of the universality of the lm predictions , beyond the rather fragmented knowledge obtained from specific models , is still lacking . in the authors view , such a framework still needs to be put in place .",
    "this framework should relate to some of the concepts of entanglement that have been surveyed in section  [ sec : entgge ] and should be able to account for the differences between gaussian and non - gaussian initial states .",
    "more importantly , the theoretical framework should also provide _ quantitative _ answers to questions about time scales and requirements for thermalization .",
    "it should tell which perturbations to the hamiltonian of an exactly solvable model like luttinger s are dominant in driving the system towards thermal equilibrium , which ones subdominant , and what the time scales associated with them are .    on the experimental side , results are coming out at an increased pace .",
    "these include the recent observation of relaxation to the generalized gibbs ensemble in an ultracold gas  @xcite .",
    "however , as theorists who cherish their own ( theoretical ) pets , we would like to see similar experiments carried out for a more faithful ( fermionic ) realization of the interaction quench in the luttinger model .",
    "our hope is that this article may motivate a young experimentalist to take on this challenge .",
    "in addition , let us mention that using different probes in the mesoscopic setup discussed in section  [ sec : expmeso ] may allow for a more thorough characterization of the non - equilibrium steady state , and whether it is really a steady state or just a pre - thermalized one .",
    "ultracold atomic systems still have a lot of offer as well as trapped ions  @xcite since possibilities for the control of the system parameters and the preparation of the initial state are larger for these systems .",
    "there are also new venues waiting to be fully explored .",
    "there is a zoo of newly discovered topologically - protected phases out there .",
    "many of them are endowed with gapless states at their interfaces with topologically trivial matter . in two dimensions ,",
    "some of these gapless states can be described as tomonaga - luttinger liquids , and the ideas described in section  [ sec : expmeso ] can be relevant for the understanding of their non - equilibrium dynamics as well . from a broader perspective , we may also wonder what kind of new manifestations in the non - equilibrium dynamics of interacting system topological protection can bring in .    going beyond isolated systems ( or systems that can be treated to a large extent as such ) ,",
    "the dynamics of the luttiger model and its relatives coupled to environments is , to the best of our knowledge , a largely uncharted territory .",
    "the study of mesoscopic systems is clearly an area that can benefit from such studies since , in the solid state , it is much more difficult to completely isolate fragile quantum systems from their environment . accounting for the effects of realistic sources of quantum dissipation  @xcite is therefore an interesting research direction .",
    "furthermore , in ultracold atomic systems , despite being largely isolated , it is also possible to engineer interesting environments  @xcite and the study of quantum dynamics in those setups should be a promising research topic .",
