    "the spin correlators are then related to correlators of monomers .",
    "in a worm algorithm @xcite , the constraint of flux conservation ( [ constraint ] ) is temporarily relaxed during a monte carlo move .",
    "one unit of flux is inserted at some lattice site and then moved through the lattice by local steps , until the insertion is healed again , either by coming back to the original site , or by a change of the local monomer number .",
    "the individual local steps are performed with metropolis update probabilities .",
    "each complete worm makes up one update step in the model with constraint ( [ constraint ] ) which is to be simulated .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , we use two different types of worm algorithms .",
    "type - i : the worms are closed , and in addition to the usual local worm propagation , there are random hops with insertion of monomers .",
    "type - ii : the worms are open strings on the lattice with monomers at the endpoints .",

    "[ worm2 ] for the simplest case of an initially empty lattice , i.e. , all dimer- and monomer variables are set to 0 in the beginning .",
    "the worm starts at a random position of the lattice ( 1 ) . it may decide to insert dimers and move to the neighboring site ( 2 ) but",
    "also monomers can be inserted ( 3 ) .",
    "the insertion of a monomer is followed by a sequence of attempts to insert another monomer at a randomly chosen site , which will succeed ( 3 ) with a probability depending on the weights @xmath41 .",
    "these steps are continued until the worm closes ( 4 ) .",
    "the acceptance of each step is governed by a metropolis decision .",

    "we denote the starting point of the worm and @xmath11 is the current position of its head .",
    "@xmath72 is a variable that determines whether the worm raises or lowers the flux .",
    "@xmath73 is a logical variable controlling the status of the worm . by @xmath74",

    "it is straightforward to show detailed balance using the boltzmann weight @xmath53 $ ] given in ( [ weight ] ) , and that the algorithm is ergodic .",
    "we also employed a second variant of the algorithm which we refer to as type - ii open worms . in this case , each worm is generated using three moves which we again illustrate for an initially empty lattice ( fig .",
    "[ worm open ] ) : the worm tries to start at a random position of the lattice by inserting a monomer ( 1 ) .",
    "it then may decide to insert dimers or monomers . if a dimer is inserted the worm moves to the neighboring site ( 2 ) .",
    "if a monomer is inserted , the worm is complete and terminates ( 3 ) . again",
    "the acceptance of the moves is decided with a metropolis step .",
    "we stress that the type - ii open worm will not work in the case of vanishing external magnetic field , i.e. , for @xmath26 . in that case",
    "no monomers appear and the type - ii worm can not start . for",
    "small @xmath4 the type - ii open worm will have a very small probability for starting , since the monomer weights are linear in @xmath4 ( for small values of @xmath4 ) . for larger values of @xmath4",
    "there is no starting problem of the type - ii worms ( see also section 4.2 ) .",
    "for @xmath80 it is straightforward to show detailed balance and ergodicity for type - ii worms , and we found that they are even simpler to implement than the closed worms .",
    "in this section we show the results of our tests and performance analysis for the two generalized worm algorithms . for a detailed discussion of the physics results obtained in the simulations of the generalized potts model we refer the reader to @xcite . here",
    "we only include a figure of the phase diagram to allow the reader to locate the parameter values of the simulations discussed in this section in the phase diagram . in fig .",

    "the same tests were conducted at other values of the parameters and also for @xmath23 and @xmath32 .",

    "we begin our assessment with analyzing the time series of measurements of the total number @xmath92 of non - zero dimer variables and the number @xmath93 of non - zero monomers .",

    "we do not observe structures on scales larger than several hundred worms and as a first impression conclude that the type - i worms lead to reasonably quick sampling .",

    "the monte carlo time on the horizontal axis is measured in units of @xmath89 worms . ]",
    "there are , however , regions in the space of couplings where one finds that the flux representation and worms are not the optimal approach . in general this is the case for very small values of @xmath4 ( typically for @xmath4 of @xmath102 ) , where the monomer weights are small ( in leading order they are linear in @xmath4 ) , and thus it is hard to generate monomers .",

    "although the time series for @xmath94 still looks reasonable , the time series for @xmath95 shows that monomers are generated only very rarely and very high statistics would be needed to obtain reliable results .",
    "we stress that this is a property of the flux representation : as mentioned , the monomer weights are very small at small @xmath4 , so monomers are indeed expected to be very rare and the flux representation is not the optimal choice for very small @xmath4 .",
    "this difficulty could be overcome by reweighting the sector of phase space with small monomer numbers to obtain a higher weight and thus higher frequency in the monte carlo .",
    "they could then be weighted back in order to compute expectation values . in the present study",
    "we did not explore such a reweighting strategy .",

    "let us now come to a quantitative comparison of the type - i closed worms and type - ii open worms . for a sensible comparison one has to consider the actual changes done by the worms : a type - ii open worm inserts two monomers at its endpoints and connects it with dimers ( one segment ) , while a type - i closed worm may consist of several segments of dimer strings connected by large hops between monomers ( it may also consist of only dimer hops without large hops , i.e. , only one closed segment ) .",
    "we first look at some characteristic quantities in order to describe the behavior of the worms in different regions of parameter space . by @xmath104",

    "in this article we presented in detail two worm algorithms that were used in a recent qcd - inspired study of the 3-state potts model with external field and chemical potential in three dimensions @xcite and analyzed their performance .",
    "the algorithms are based on a flux representation of the model which can be obtained using high temperature expansion techniques .",
    "the nearest neighbor term leads to the conventional dimer - based closed contours , while the magnetic terms allow violation of the constraint through the insertion of monomers ( similar structures will appear whenever one considers spin systems that are coupled to an external field ) .",
    "furthermore , the chemical potential gives a different weight to monomers and antimonomers .",
    "thus the model provides a rather general testbed for various algorithmic ideas based on the worm concept @xcite .",
    "we explored two types of generalized worm algorithms that differ in their treatment of monomers .",
    "the type - i closed worms start with dimers or monomers and allow for dimer insertions or the insertion of monomers which are then followed by a random hop to another position where a second monomer is inserted .",
    "these closed worms finish when the starting position is reached again . on the other hand",
    "the type - ii open worms create chains of dimers that start and end with the insertion of monomers .",

    "we then presented the results of an analysis of the autocorrelation times , suitably scaled to reflect computational effort .",

    "type - ii open worms perform considerably better in monomer dominated regions of the parameter space .",
    "however , we expect that changing the ratio of monomer to dimer steps in type - i closed worms would improve the latter for situations where monomers are abundant .",
    "the authors expect that generalizations of the worm concept will see a lot of attention in the future : matter fields ( bosonic and fermionic ) give rise to closed loops of flux on a lattice , and worm algorithms are a natural approach to update such a system . of course in more realistic models",
    "the structure of the fluxes is more involved ( see , e.g. , the generalized effective polyakov loop model @xcite ) and new strategies need to be found .",
