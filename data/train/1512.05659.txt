    "research on complex processes that arise in human settlements has recently attracted much attention since its results have proven to be useful in science - based socio - political decisions and in the efficient use of urban resources @xcite .",
    "one of the fields of this broad topic is the study of road networks and how it affects the social tissue and traffic behaviour while other works focus mainly in the abstract properties of the system .",
    "the road structure , one of the most prototypical and studied network types , condenses in its intricate configuration an uncountable number of interventions that happened upon it . as such",
    ", it conveys the information of historical and political periods and of the micro - decisions that occurred in those points in time , but in its aggregated state these decisions are diluted into a different type of logic , allowing us to study the current state of the network in terms of its physical properties as we would with any other system .",
    "we present in this work the application of a percolation process to the road network and the analysis of its results using a similar methodology to the one presented by the authors in @xcite but applied to the relative angles in the system instead of the metric distances .",
    "many structures in natural and artificial systems arise as a result of complex processes . in some cases",
    "it is even possible to infer these processes from the final structure of the system @xcite .",
    "percolation @xcite is a natural process that happens in different types of systems and it is used in fields as varied as oil extraction @xcite , the study of the electrical conductivity of materials @xcite , polymerization processes @xcite , epidemic studies @xcite and fire spreading @xcite or even the modular structure of brain networks @xcite or the spread of obesity @xcite .",
    "percolation processes are a branch from the field of complex systems that aims to study how geometrical microscopical properties affect the macroscopic configuration of the ensemble .",
    "these types of processes present a phase transition at a specific occupation probability , above which an infinite cluster is formed ( over a theoretical infinite lattice ) . below this critical probability",
    "only finite clusters are formed , that is , the density of occupation is not enough such that the connectivity saturates and covers the whole lattice with one continuous cluster .",
    "percolation has been previously applied to different types of properties of the road network and in general of human settlements . at times , the percolation is a percolation of a different process over the road network such as traffic behaviour @xcite or the robustness of the network @xcite and in some cases as in the work presented by the authors in @xcite the percolation is purely a process on the configurational and geometric structure of the road network .",
    "several authors have studied the application of percolation processes to spatially constrained networks , specifically to erdos - renyi networks @xcite .",
    "there is , as well , a paper @xcite that proposes a methodology to generate a set of superhighways and roads by using percolation over the minimum spanning tree of a network .",
    "this last approach is shown to give good performance on the graphs studied in the paper ( erdos - renyi , scale - free and grids ) , but it is not applicable to road networks since the main premise of the paper ( that the mst contains the main roads ) does not hold in road networks generating discontinuities in the main roads , so any subset of the mst will not hold the main roads .",
    "percolation has also been used to study the emergence of regions in @xcite .",
    "the approach undertaken in this paper introduces a novel methodology by applying the percolation process to the road network using the relative angle between road segments as the occupation probability .",
    "relative angles between roads segments have been part of the literature on road network analysis for a long time .",
    "we can find several works that classify different cities typologies and that use relative angles as part of their characterization @xcite .",
    "moreover , some other works have focused on generating dual informational graphs using the relative angle between segments @xcite while others use the relative angles between street segments ( noted as _ angular distance _ ) as the main driver for the analysis that uses centrality measures to infer route choice or urban structure @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper a theoretical result showing that under its angular description , the road network presents a first order phase transition and as a subsequent result of the percolation technique , a novel methodology to produce a hierarchical classification of road networks , which runs in linear time and is capable of simultaneously extracting the main skeleton of the underlying road network and of producing an index of the hierarchical level of each road .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ methodology ]",
    "we present the main traits of our methodology and explain several considerations in terms of the notation and the data used . in section  [ experimentalresults ] we present the main formulae of percolation processes , explain the complete methodology followed to obtain the critical exponents of the percolation and report the values of the exponents from our experiments . in section  [ relevantregimes ]",
    "we show how shannon s entropy of the distribution of the cluster sizes can help us determine the relevant regimes that happen during this percolation process and we study how the percolation process under its angular description gradually incorporates roads by their relative hierarchy in the system . in section  [ hierarchicalindex ]",
    "we present a novel index that can be produced using the percolation process and that helps characterise the importance of each road segment . finally in section  [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions and ideas for future work . for the interested reader ,",
    "we introduce all the specificities of the algorithm to calculate the percolation process in the appendix  [ algorithm ] .",
    "the properties of road networks can be divided into two subclasses : structural and geometrical .",
    "structural properties are studied by representing the network as a graph ( in which nodes are intersections and edges represent streets ) which allows us to calculate several features such as the distributions of degrees , neighborhoods , the spectrum of the graph , extract communities from it or apply centrality measures to further analyse its characteristics .",
    "geometrical properties , in turn , are related to distances over the network , lengths of street segments , width of roads , the slopes formed by the topography and the one that is the focus of our work , the relative angle between two street segments .",
    "one of the most common ways to incorporate these geometric factors into the analysis is to include them as weights of the graph that represents the structure of the network .",
    "this is easy to establish in the case of the length of street segments , since they are a relationship between the nodes of the graph , but in order to incorporate the relative angles and considering that they are relationships between streets ( edges of the graph ) we need to generate the edge - node dual ( or line - graph @xcite ) of the road network s graph ( @xmath0 , figure  [ p].a ) .",
    "the line - graph ( @xmath1 , figure  [ p].b ) of the road network will have a node for each edge ( street ) in the original graph and a edge each time that two edges of the original graph share a node and the weight of the edge is the relative angle .",
    "this is similar to what is done in @xcite with the difference that we do not normalize the values of the relative angles . throughout the text",
    "we will we refer to the number of edges of the line graph as the mass of a cluster or the system .",
    "we perform a bond percolation on the line - graph ( @xmath2 ) of the street network . given a certain angular threshold , the occupation probability for an edge is the probability that an edge of the line - graph has a weight equal or below the angular threshold ( figure  [ p].c ) . further explaining this concept , in a regular percolation",
    "if we set the probability to 0.5 half of the sites become occupied , and in order to mimic this behaviour in our context what we can do is to calculate what percentage of edges are below or equal to a threshold to see how many edges will be occupied ( e.g. , 37.6% of the edges are below or equal to 45 degrees , therefore the associated probability to the 45 degrees threshold is @xmath3 ) .    for this work",
    ", we have analyzed the uk road network .",
    "the original data for the road network of the uk is from the os mastermap database ( itn layer ) @xcite .",
    "the network was simplified , collapsing lanes and removing nodes of degree 2 ( intermediate nodes between intersections ) .",
    "this node removal modifies the result of the analysis by not taking into account the variation of angles within segments in between intersections .",
    "this variation is simultaneously negligible given that the angles within a road segment are not going to be very large and at the same time doing the analysis in this way produces a more robust determination of the properties of the system away from details of the digitalization and taking into account only the structural configuration of the network . even after this simplification",
    ", the line - graph generated from the network holds 4 million nodes and 7 million edges .",
    "we present in this section the formulae that describes typical percolation processes and the methods used to calculate the critical exponents .",
    "we will show how to calculate these exponents for the system as a finite object , and how to remove the finite size effect when calculating these values in order to obtain the exponents for a theoretical infinite lattice . for a full explanation and proofs of the typical results of percolation processes we encourage the reader to refer to @xcite and to @xcite to better understand the methodology we have followed in order to remove the finite size effect .    in order to try to explain in a simplified manner how a percolation process behaves",
    ", we can imagine a grid of wool and that we start to pour water drop by drop in the intersections of the grid .",
    "initially some separate stains ( clusters ) appear , but as the quantity of water increases ( the occupation probability ) the clusters start to interconnect until only one large continuous cluster is visible , which is called the spanning cluster .",
    "we refer to the largest cluster at each step as the giant cluster and when the phase transition is reached , the giant cluster is also called spanning or infinite cluster .",
    "the actual process is usually applied in a lattice , where the occupation probability is the probability that a site is occupied . when occupied sites are adjacent they are considered a single cluster .",
    "this process is obtained for finite systems and then extended to a theoretical infinite system by removing the finite size effect .",
    "when removing the finite size effect , we will need to use the lattice length ( @xmath4 ) of our system which is not available to us since our system is not a lattice , but we can observe directly the mass of the system @xmath5 which is the number of edges of the line graph ( see section  [ methodology ] ) .",
    "moreover , our system is not a regular lattice but a fractal object , so , in order to obtain the lattice size we need to calculate the fractal dimension of our system ( @xmath6 ) using box - counting and then , given that @xmath7 we can obtain a lattice size .    in order to characterise the percolation we have studied several of its critical exponents that are determined by the properties of the system .",
    "the first of these measurements is the mean cluster size of the finite clusters @xmath8 ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].a ) which is related to the critical exponent @xmath9 that measures the increase and decay of the size of the finite clusters around the critical probability ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this calculation allows us to clearly identify the probability where the phase transition arises .",
    "the critical probability is the probability before the size of the finite clusters drops suddenly .",
    "note that above the critical probability the giant cluster is infinite and therefore is not taken into account .",
    "the system under study undergoes a first - order phase transition at the moment the giant cluster spans over the whole system , at the 45.8 degrees angle which corresponds to the probability @xmath11 . in finite systems",
    "the calculation of @xmath9 can be obtained by plotting the @xmath8 vs. @xmath12 for @xmath13 below the critical probability in a log - log plot and measuring the slope of the plot ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].c ) .",
    "@xmath14    the second property to study is the probability of a site belonging to the giant cluster @xmath15 ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].b ) which has a related critical exponent @xmath16 that measures how fast is this probability growing after the critical probability has been reached . to calculate the exponent @xmath16 for a finite system we just need to plot the @xmath15 vs. @xmath17 for @xmath13 above the critical probability in a log - log plot and measure its slope ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].d ) .",
    "@xmath18    the correlation length is the typical radius of the largest finite cluster .",
    "this correlation length @xmath19 is related to another critical exponent @xmath20 . in finite systems ,",
    "we can obtain the @xmath20 exponent by measuring the correlation length and following a similar procedure as the cases above or simply apply the scaling law @xmath21 and arithmetically obtain @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath22    another of the critical exponents is the fractal dimension of the spanning cluster at the phase transition ( @xmath23 ) , which characterises how its size grows with respect to the lattice size in finite systems .",
    "@xmath24where @xmath25 is the mass of the spanning ( or giant ) cluster at the phase transition of a lattice of size @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath26 we can say @xmath27 or @xmath28 .    to be able to calculate these exponents removing the finite size effects we proceed as follows .",
    "the first step is to calculate the percolation in systems of different sizes , so we used our full set of roads , and then we generated 5 other subsets of the road network and calculated the percolation in those systems .",
    "each of those systems will have a different mass but maintain the same fractal dimension , therefore each system has a different lattice size . in a percolation process we have equation ( [ eq_pinf ] ) and equation ( [ eq_correlationlength ] ) so we can write @xmath15 as a function of the correlation length @xmath29 and this result will hold as long as the lattice size is larger than the correlation length but , in finite systems , close to @xmath10 the correlation length tends to infinity and it is larger than any lattice size , therefore , the size of the largest cluster at @xmath10 will be capped by the lattice size as @xmath30 , which equivalent to saying @xmath31 .",
    "we can , therefore , plot the values of @xmath25 in a log - log plot vs. @xmath4 ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].e ) and by measuring its slope obtain the exponent @xmath23 that is used to calculate the relation @xmath32 .",
    "we should remark that the critical probability in an infinite lattice will probably be different from the previously calculated critical probability , so we need to find which one is the critical probability in an infinite lattice .",
    "one way to calculate where this @xmath10 is located ( see @xcite ) is to plot @xmath33 vs. @xmath13 and tweak the value of @xmath34 until all the curves cross in one single point ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].f ) .",
    "as we can see , this is not perfect in our system due to the experimental nature of the data , but it is fairly close .    in turn",
    ", the exponent @xmath9 is also dependent on the lattice size and to avoid the finite size effects , by a similar reasoning , we can calculate @xmath35 at several different lattice sizes at the critical probability which will give us a proportion @xmath36 , so by calculating the slope of the log - log plot of @xmath35 vs. @xmath4 ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].g ) we can determine @xmath37 .",
    "this exponent can also be calculated arithmetically once we have obtained @xmath23 by using the following relationship @xmath38 , but we choose to calculate it from the gathered data in order to be able to check the correctness of the values obtained .    in order to find the values of @xmath16 , @xmath9 and @xmath20 in infinite systems we need to find one of the three independently .",
    "we proceed following the methodology presented in @xcite by plotting all the results of the different calculated lattices in a plot of @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 ( figure  [ firstphasetransition].h ) and tweak the value of @xmath41 until all the data collapses in a single result giving us the correct value of @xmath20 which in turn allows us to determine @xmath16 and @xmath9 .",
    "as we can see in table  [ criticalexponents ] our results are supported by the scaling law @xmath21 .    with the exponents",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath9 we can directly calculate the exponents @xmath42 and @xmath43 since there is an arithmetic relationship between them , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . the exponent @xmath42 determines how fast is the variation of the characteristic cluster size .",
    "@xmath46    while @xmath43 serves to characterize the variation of the normalized number of clusters around @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath47    where @xmath48 is the size of the cluster and @xmath49 is the characteristic cluster size and @xmath50 is the scaling function for the cluster number density and is defined as @xmath51 .",
    "[ my - label ]    .critical exponents of the phase transition for the finite and the infinite system .",
    "the values marked with ( * ) are the ones that have been calculated from the experimental results , the rest of the exponents were calculated by using the scaling relationships between exponents.[criticalexponents ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     these reported results of the critical exponents and typical values for the percolation in our approach are fundamental in order to completely characterize the results , and will serve in the future to perform comparisons with other road networks and estimate the variations ( or uniformity ) of systems in terms of their angular description .",
    "the angular percolation on road networks follow different growth rates of the giant cluster as we go through the different thresholds , and even changes in the type of growth which ranges from a regime that increases the spanning capacity of the cluster at the beginning to a growth that is based on the densification of the cluster at the largest thresholds .    to determine these regimes that characterise the formation of the giant cluster , we can analyse shannon s entropy of the distributions of the cluster sizes at the different thresholds @xmath52 where @xmath53 , that is , the fraction of the mass of cluster @xmath54 over the total mass of all the clusters .",
    "we observe in this measurement that the curve has several different slopes that can be mapped to different speeds of variation in the entropy levels of the distribution of the clusters .",
    "then , by identifying the points where the slope changes we can set the different boundaries for the different regimes in terms of its percolation threshold . in doing so",
    ", we have identified 5 different regimes .    1 .   the initial regime in which the size of the giant cluster can be disregarded and only very small clusters are formed .",
    "the second is the formation regime , where the giant cluster is starting to be formed and that ends in the phase transition that sets the point at which the giant cluster becomes infinite spanning over the whole system ( from scotland to the southern part of england ) .",
    "3 .   the consolidation regime spans between the phase transition at 45.8 degrees and approximately ends at 60 degrees and in this regime the giant cluster gets fully formed spanning over the full uk space and incorporating the most important roads .",
    "this regime marks also the point in which the giant cluster of the percolation is covering for the first time the whole territory of the uk cutting throughout its road network in all directions and making it impossible for the second largest cluster to develop",
    ". a closer look at the network formed at this threshold shows that this is also the regime where the giant cluster contains all and only the roads that are considered as first order roads of the network .",
    "4 .   next ,",
    "the densification phase starts to incorporate the minor roads and by the end of it ( approx .",
    "90 degrees ) the most important local roads are also included .",
    "5 .   that leaves only the saturation regime to incorporate the rest of the local roads and alley - ways .    as we can see in figure  [ percentageroads ] as the percolation advances through the different thresholds it incorporates to the giant cluster sequentially the roads by importance .",
    "furthermore , we can also observe in the figure how there are two different rates of incorporation of the roads , the upper strategy of the most important roads that get quickly annexed to the giant cluster ( motorways , a roads , b roads and minor roads ) and the lower strategy in which local roads and alleys are incorporated much later on .",
    "a very interesting observation is that when the roads are disaggregated by its secondary classification into dual / single carriageways , we can see that the different regimes identified with the entropy analysis actually correspond to different stages in terms of the types of roads that are incorporated to the giant cluster . at the phase transition the percolation incorporates to the giant cluster all the motorways .",
    "the end of the consolidation phase corresponds roughly to the moment where not only the motorways but also a roads ( dc ) and b roads ( dc ) are completely incorporated into the giant cluster .",
    "the end of the densification regime correspond to the point where simultaneously the a roads ( sc ) , b roads ( sc ) , all minor roads ( dc and sc ) and the local roads ( dc ) are all incorporated into the cluster .",
    "the end of the saturation phase corresponds to where all the rest of roads ( local roads ( sc ) and alleys ) are also into the cluster .    in the lower panel of figure  [ percentageroads ]",
    "we can get a visual idea of the roads that are in the giant cluster at the threshold of 45.9 degrees ( in black ) , just after the phase transition , compared to the full set of roads ( in light blue ) and it is easy to see that the giant cluster after the phase transition already contains the main roads of the system . in order to quantify this relation",
    "it is important to remark that despite the fact that the giant cluster just after the phase transition has a mass of only 17% of the full road network it already contains 98.3% of the motorways , 66.9% of the a roads , 47.7% of the b roads , 28.8% of the minor roads while only containing 0.50% of the local roads and 0.35% of the alleys .",
    "this gives us an idea of how well the giant cluster after the phase transition of the percolation is containing the main skeleton of the network .",
    "actually if we disaggregate the roads by their secondary classification ( single or dual carriageway , sc / dc ) we observe that after the phase transition the giant cluster contains 99.5% of the motorways ( dc ) , 81.5% of a roads(dc ) , 71% of b roads ( dc ) and 52.4% of the minor roads ( dc ) . as we can see , our approach forms a clearly separated set of roads that correspond to the main roads of the system .",
    "this set of roads compose the skeleton of the system , which is obtained by extracting the giant cluster at one of the stages in the consolidation phase , as close as possible to the critical probability to include the minimum number of roads .",
    "hierarchical classification of road networks is of fundamental importance to aid drivers in the identification of the most probable routes between destinations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some algorithms for the detection of shortest routes in road networks are also highly dependent on the classification and hierarchical organisation of road networks @xcite .",
    "there is , therefore , a large interest in the generation of a methodology to automate the hierarchical classification of road networks .",
    "historically , this classification has been manually obtained . as an example , in the uk , the process has been decentralized , giving local authorities the responsibility for the management of road classification .",
    "the large number of roads would make this task unmanageable from a centralised perspective but it has as a consequence that the classification of roads is uneven throughout the territory of the uk , given the number of different actors involved in the process .",
    "centrality measures have played a major role in the description of systems of road networks allowing to uncover a large number of its properties . as such ,",
    "one of the most accepted methodologies to visualize the hierarchical organisation of the road network is the use of centrality measures such as betweenness @xcite which can give a value for each road proportional to the quantity of flow that goes through it in the system , which can help to give a visual interpretation of the road hierarchies .",
    "much work has been done in the analysis of flows using centrality measures @xcite and a large part of that body of research has been devoted to the use of angular distances @xcite which seems to improve the detection of those main flows @xcite .",
    "the large drawback of using betweeneness to generate this index is that the complexity of its computation ( @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of nodes of the graph ) makes unfeasible its use for large systems .",
    "we propose in this section a novel index that highlights the importance of each road by analysing the mass of the clusters that have included a specific road along the different thresholds .",
    "the technique proposed in this paper is computationally a lot less demanding than calculating the betweenness index being linear in its complexity ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of thresholds which is independent of the size of the input and can be considered a constant , therefore , @xmath59 ) which means that it is fully capable of analysing large systems . in order to perform this analysis , we take for each threshold the set of clusters formed . for each cluster",
    "we assign a value of the logarithm of the total mass of the cluster to each road in it . by adding together all those values for the complete set of thresholds , each road is assigned an index that evokes its relative importance in the system . considering that shannon s entropy gives us a way to characterise the informational content of a distribution we can use it to add value only when we can extract enough information from the distribution of the cluster sizes .",
    "hence , we use a weighted sum of the log of the sizes using the entropy values of the distribution of sizes for each threshold .",
    "another correction included in the formula is that we normalise the values by the log of the total size of the system in pursue of obtaining a value that is independent of the size of the system .",
    "more formally we can write that the hierarchical index of road @xmath54 ( @xmath60 ) is :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 goes through all the percolation thresholds ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath63 is the mass of the cluster that contains road @xmath54 at the @xmath62-_th _ threshold , @xmath64 is the entropy of the distribution of the cluster sizes at the @xmath62-_th _ threshold and @xmath5 is the total mass of the system",
    ".    in figure  [ fig::hierarchicalindex ] we can view on the upper panel the percentage of roads per value of the hierarchical index obtained with our methodology , it clearly shows that the different types of roads have values ordered as expected ( the highest values correspond to motorways , then a - roads , followed by b - roads , minor roads , local streets and alleys ) .",
    "moreover , by looking at the right upper panel of the figure we can see that actually the index classifies with the same histogram a - roads ( sc ) and b - roads ( dc ) , the same is happening for b - roads ( sc ) and minor roads ( dc ) .",
    "meanwhile , a - roads ( dc ) get closer to their classification as motorways .",
    "this observations hint that though their classification is a priori different , the fact that internally ( in the comparison between the secondary classification sc / dc ) dual - carriageway roads are more important than single ones affects their importance within the system and more importantly this information can be extracted purely from its geometry .",
    "we have shown in this paper the existence of first order phase transitions in the road network , the properties of which and its mathematical proof will be further studied in a future work .",
    "we have as well provided with a methodology to extract the main skeleton of the network , shown that there exists several regimes of the percolation that can be identified through the entropy of the cluster size distribution and presented the formulation of an index that serves for the hierarchical classification of the road network .",
    "we have seen in this work how the road network behaves under its angular description using a percolation process .",
    "this angular description seems to be a natural way of describing the road network given the plethora of results that can be obtained with such percolation process .",
    "the presence of a first - order transition where the system changes its behaviour , and the fact that the percolation serves to classify the hierarchy of the network are very promising results that open up new possibilities for further studying its properties .",
    "furthermore , the hierarchical index of the percolation can serve as the basis for an algorithm in the spirit of contraction hierarchies that improves the speed of shortest path analysis . these are properties that the system did not present under its metric description and that , therefore , speak of the angular nature of the road network .    the most important piece of future work will be to apply this process to other systems , road networks from different continents and natural systems and establish a comparison by using the critical exponents of the infinite lattice to study what properties",
    "do they share , how they differ and if this procedure can be of use to infer growth processes and to classify such behaviour .",

    "given a graph of the road network @xmath65 , where nodes represent intersections and edges represent streets , we generate its line - graph and assign the angular distance between streets as the weights of the edges of the line - graph ( @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the weight function that given an edge returns its angular weight ) .",
    "for a certain angular threshold ( @xmath58 ) ( e.g. @xmath68 degrees ) we produce a network percolation as follows :          1 .   generate a new cluster and insert the transition into the cluster , set @xmath76 .",
    "2 .   we will keep a first - in first - out queue of _ nodes to expand _ , from which we will extract a node to continue the process .",
    "we add both nodes of the transition selected in step 1 to this queue .",
    "nodes are only added to this queue if they are not already included ( which can be checked with a simple boolean function ) .",
    "3 .   extract a node from the queue of _ nodes to explore _ and if a transition departing from that node ( not yet included in a cluster ) is smaller than the threshold , include the transition into the cluster and the end - node of the transition into the queue of nodes to explore .",
    "repeat step 3 until no further node can be expanded ( the queue is empty ) .",
    "road networks graphs have very specific characteristics , they are planar , sparse and due to spatial restrictions ( of the width of the streets ) their maximum degree is very limited ( to around @xmath77 ) . considering all these features of these graphs the proposed algorithm runs in linear time :    *",
    "the number of edges in a planar graph is linear with respect to the number of nodes @xmath78 . *",
    "the complexity of generating a linegraph is given by going through all the edges and then through all the edges that depart from its nodes .",
    "this can be quadratic in the number of edges in any given graph ( which for a complete graph would be quartic in the number of nodes ) , but in road networks is linear since its complexity will be @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the degree of node @xmath81 from edge @xmath82 ( same for @xmath83 ) , but in these graphs the maximum degree can be considered constant @xmath84 , so its complexity is more or less @xmath85 and because the graph is planar the complexity is more or less linear in the number of nodes @xmath86 .",
    "* what is purely the algorithm to create the clusters is closely related to a bfs and could actually be implemented as such . the inner loop will be a bfs exactly when all the weights are under the threshold and then we will go once more through all the edges ( because of the pile @xmath13 ) , in other cases the inner loop will be partials bfs ( or not executed , in the case that every weight is above the threshold ) . in any case the running time will be of o(n+m+m ) which can be reduced to o(n ) .",
    "so the total running time of the algorithm ( including generating the linegraph ) in road networks is o(n ) ."
