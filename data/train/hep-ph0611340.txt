    "strong decays of charmonia through annihilation of the @xmath5 pair to light hadrons dominate the total widths of the lighter charmonium states @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the faster open - charm decays , which appear to be reasonably well described by both the @xmath6p@xmath7 model @xcite and the cornell timelike vector decay model @xcite ( given the current state of the data ) , the @xmath5 annihilation decays are much less well understood .",
    "there are several general rules that appear to be respected by these decays ; in particular , the number of qcd vertices in the leading - order feynman diagram for annihilation into light quarks and gluons is a useful guide .",
    "for example , the c = @xmath8 charmonia that can annihilate at @xmath9 ( into @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for the @xmath3 ) have strong annihilation widths of @xmath13  mev , often much larger than the @xmath14  mev widths of the c = @xmath15 states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which must annihilate at @xmath18 into @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath5 annihilation is a short - ranged process ( the charm quark propagator implies a range of @xmath20 ) , a strong suppression of annihilation widths with increasing orbital angular momentum l@xmath21 is also anticipated ; this suggests for example that the d - wave @xmath5 states @xmath22d@xmath23 and @xmath6d@xmath23 , if below their dd * open - charm threshold , will have strong widths of @xmath24  mev @xcite .",
    "although the inclusive annihilation decays are qualitatively understood in terms of @xmath5 annihilation into gluons , exclusive @xmath5 annihilation decays remain a mystery , despite the existence of considerable experimental information on the branching fractions of some @xmath5 states into specific exclusive modes .",
    "in particular , much is known about the exclusive two - body annihilation decays of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and a  12% rule \" for the relative branching fractions of the @xmath17 and @xmath16 into many of these modes is part of charmonium folklore .",
    "the recent increase in the number of modes studied , for example by cleo - c  @xcite , has made it clear however that this rule is not generally applicable .    in this paper",
    "we note that there may be a simple relation between some two - body and three - body annihilation decays of charmonia , specifically in decays to the final states @xmath0 and @xmath25 .",
    "these decays are of interest both as a novel technique for studying n@xmath26 spectroscopy , for example at bes @xcite and because they can be used to estimate the cross sections for associated charmonium production in @xmath0 annihilation , as in @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "( we use @xmath28 to represent a generic charmonium state . )",
    "these cross sections are of particular interest in that they will be exploited by the panda project at gsi @xcite to search for excited charmonia and charmonium hybrids .",
    "the scales of these cross sections are at present largely unknown ; a better understanding of these associated charmonium production processes near threshold is obviously crucial for planning various aspects of this experiment , such as detector design and data acquisition .",
    "since strong decays to three - body final states are typically dominated by quasi - two - body transitions , one might anticipate that decays of the type @xmath29 could be described as two - step processes , @xmath30 , where the important n@xmath26 baryon isobars are those with large n@xmath31 couplings . specifically we might expect the nucleon itself to make a large or perhaps dominant contribution , in view of the large nn@xmath31 coupling .",
    "this in turn suggests that the associated production of a @xmath28 state and a pion in @xmath0 annihilation may take place through initial emission of a pion from the incoming @xmath32 or @xmath33 line , followed by direct annihilation of the @xmath0 state into @xmath5 . at tree level",
    "this process is described by the two feynman diagrams of fig.[fig : diags ] .",

    "their work was subsequently extended analytically by lundborg , barnes and wiedner @xcite ( much of ref.@xcite was numerical ) .",
    "et al . _ also showed that a constant amplitude approximation could be used to estimate the cross section for @xmath1 from the corresponding three - body decay @xmath29 ; numerical results for @xmath34 using both approaches are given in that reference .",
    "the work presented here gives extensive analytic results for differential and total cross sections derived from the pole model , assuming plane wave initial @xmath0 states .",
    "if the partial width of a charmonium state @xmath28 to @xmath0 is known experimentally , one can use this to estimate the corresponding @xmath35 coupling constant @xmath36 .",
    "since the nn@xmath31 coupling constant is known , one may then evaluate the differential and total cross sections for @xmath1 both analytically and numerically in this model . here",
    "we carry out this exercise for the cases of five low - lying @xmath28 states with known @xmath0 partial widths , specifically the @xmath37 and @xmath3 .",
    "we describe the reactions @xmath1 as two step processes , initial pion emission from an incident proton or antiproton followed by direct annihilation of the proton - antiproton pair , @xmath38 .",
    "this process at tree level is described by the two feynman diagrams of fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 vertices are taken to be the usual @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 vertex is generically @xmath43 , where the dirac matrix @xmath44 specifies the quantum numbers of the state @xmath28 .",
    "we use @xmath45 for the @xmath46 , @xmath47 for the @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath50 for the @xmath3 . for the vector and axial - vector cases @xmath51 and @xmath3 , @xmath44 is implicitly contracted into the final @xmath28 polarization four - vector @xmath52 .",

    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant is @xmath58 , and the ( state - dependent ) charmonium-@xmath0 coupling constant is @xmath59 .",
    "we also define squared strong coupling constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to rewrite this invariant amplitude in an equivalent form that makes the overall @xmath62 crossing symmetry more evident ;    -3 cm m = -  . since the commutator ( anticommutator ) of @xmath63 with @xmath44 vanishes for scalar ( pseudoscalar ) @xmath28 , this rearrangement simplifies the calculation considerably in these cases .",
    "the differential and total cross sections we find given this invariant amplitude are rather simple in the massless pion limit , and only involve two independent functions .",
    "for this reason we first give results for massless pions , and then treat each set of charmonium quantum numbers separately for nonzero pion mass .",
    "our results for the unpolarized differential cross sections in the massless pion limit are    -0.5 cm |_p|p ^0 _ c =  , [ eq : dsigdt1 ]    -0.7 cm |_p|p ^0 _ 0 = |_p|p ^0 ( j/ ,  ) = + 1.1 cm  , [ eq : dsigdt2 ]    -2.1 cm |_p|p ^0 _ 1 = 1.0 cm  .",

    "there are several interesting features in these angular distributions which are relevant to panda .",
    "note that the differential cross sections in eqs.([eq : dsigdt1]-[eq : dsigdt3 ] ) are @xmath62 ( @xmath70 ) crossing symmetric , and that there are maxima in the forward and backwards directions , which give the largest values for the proton propagator functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 . a more striking effect is the zero in the angular distribution of the final state @xmath73 , which follows from the odd @xmath62 spatial symmetry of this amplitude ; this implies a node at @xmath74 , corresponding to @xmath75 in the @xmath76  frame . in comparison",
    "the angular distributions of the other final states we consider also have minima at @xmath74 , but are nonzero there .",
    "these rapidly varying angular distribution could be used to test for the presence of this signal over the presumably more slowly varying backgrounds .      in the massless pion limit",
    "the unpolarized total cross sections follow from integrating the results in eqs.([eq : dsigdt1]-[eq : dsigdt3 ] ) over @xmath77 .",

    "the results given in the previous section for massless pions are attractive in their simplicity , and are useful for numerical estimates well above threshold .",
    "however we find that the angular distributions near threshold are strongly dependent on the pion mass ( the massless case is a singular limit ) , and the difference in the location of the threshold for massless versus massive pions leads to numerically important differences in the predicted cross sections at energies relevant to panda . for these reasons we give detailed predictions for the differential and total cross sections for these charmonium production processes in the case of general pion mass .    since we will discuss some angular distributions in the _ c.m .",
