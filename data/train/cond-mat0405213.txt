    "a deeper understanding of the behavior of disordered systems , and notably glassy ones , represents an outstanding challenge in modern condensed matter physics . in the face of the lack of a comprehensive theory ,",
    "much work is currently devoted to the numerical simulation of glassy behavior . to date",
    ", these simulation efforts rely mainly on molecular dynamics and monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "both methods incorporate details of microscopic behavior ( intermolecular potentials ) and , as a result , they fall short of reaching spatio - temporal scales of macroscopic interest .",
    "a typical molecular dynamics simulation would last a few tens - hundreds of nanoseconds , to be contrasted with relaxation times of the order of an hour and more of real glasses .",
    "larger scales are made accessible by coarse - grained lattice gas models in which the details of true molecular interactions are replaced by suitable heuristics about the behavior of fictitious lattice molecules .",
    "these models reach out larger scales but the corresponding outcomes have to be critically weighted against the simplifying assumptions they are based upon . at the extreme of this line one finds spin - glasses @xcite and their modern lattice glass variants @xcite .    although to a different degree of physical fidelity ,",
    "all of these models retain the many - body nature of the intermolecular interactions , with an inevitable price in terms of computational effort .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to explore whether mesoscopic models , namely suitable _ effective one - body formulations _ may capture at least some basic features of glassy behavior , at a fraction of the computational cost associated with the aforementioned many - body simulation techniques .    in the present paper",
    "this task is pursued within the framework of the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) , a minimal kinetic equation describing stylized pseudo - molecules evolving in a regular lattice according to a simple local dynamics including free - streaming , collisional relaxation and ( effective ) intermolecular interactions @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall show that it is possible to construct a class of suitable mesoscopic potentials supporting some basic traits of disordered systems . here",
    "we shall focus on a minimal requirement : the ability to sustain sharp density contrasts within a disordered pattern .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , after a cursory view of the main features of the standard lbe , we present our model .",
    "section iii is devoted to the results of numerical simulations and finally , we discuss the main findings of the present paper and outline possible future research directions .",
    "the most popular form of lattice boltzmann equation ( lattice bgk , for bhatnagar , gross , krook ) @xcite , reads as follows : @xmath1(\\vec{r},t)\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a discrete distribution function of particles moving along with discrete speed @xmath3 .",
    "the right - hand side represents the relaxation to a local equilibrium @xmath4 in a time lapse of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "this local equilibrium is usually taken in the form of a quadratic expansion of a local maxwellian : @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the fluid density , @xmath8 the fluid current , @xmath9 is a set of weights normalized to unity , @xmath10 the lattice sound speed ( a constant equal to @xmath11 in our case ) and finally , @xmath12 stands for the unit tensor .",
    "the set of discrete speeds must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee mass , momentum and energy conservation , as well as rotational invariance .",
    "only a limited subclass of lattices qualifies . in the sequel",
    ", we shall refer to the nine - speed lattice consisting of zero - speed , speed one @xmath13 ( nearest - neighbor connection ) , and speed @xmath14 , ( next - nearest - neighbor connection ) .",
    "standard analysis shows that the lbe system behaves like a quasi - incompressible fluid with an ideal equation of state @xmath15 and kinematic viscosity @xmath16 .",
    "departures from ideal - gas behavior within the lbe formalism are typically described by means of phenomenological pseudo - potentials mimicking the effects of potential energy interactions @xcite .",
    "these pseudo - potentials have proved capable of describing a wide range of complex fluid behaviors , such as phase - separation in binary fluids and phase - transitions . to date",
    ", however , no lbe model appears to have addressed frustrated systems .",
    "this is precisely the scope of this work .",
    "we choose the empirical pseudo - potential in the form of a lattice - truncated repulsive lennard - jones interaction : @xmath17 where the cut - off @xmath18 in lattice units and @xmath19 is a parameter controlling the strength of the interaction ( an inverse effective temperature ) , hence the surface tension between dense and light phases .",
    "the density - dependence is taken in the form of a hierarchy of polynomials , whose density zeroes are distributed according to a binary tree of depth @xmath20 ( number of generations ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the typical scale for the density gap . starting with the root value @xmath23 , at each generation @xmath24 , a mother density @xmath25 spawns two children @xmath26 spaced by an amount @xmath27 away from the mother value .",
    "this hierarchical potential implements the presence of @xmath28 competing density extrema .",
    "as an example , for @xmath29 , @xmath30 the denominator serves the purpose of letting @xmath31 outside the hierarchical range of zeroes @xmath25 .",
    "the result is an effective potential alternating stable repulsive regions ( @xmath32 , prime meaning derivative with respect to @xmath33 ) with unstable attractive ones ( @xmath34 ) , distributed approximately in the density range @xmath35 .",
    "since the case @xmath36 ( cubic interaction ) is somewhat equivalent to a van der waals interaction , we can think to our potential as of a series of hierarchically nested van der waals interactions .",
    "it is intuitively clear that if the coupling strength @xmath19 is sufficiently strong , attractive regions are subject to instabilities which can be likened to a phase transition .",
    "however , since there are multiple forbidden regions interweaved with density gaps with ( meta)stable behavior , the system is amenable to a full cascade of phase - transitions , depending on the strength of the interaction . as a result",
    ", the fluid is expected to exhibit a sort of `` frustration '' resulting from the competition of the multiple density minima .",
    "this competition is resolved through steep interfaces connecting the stable density regimes . in the language of free - volume theory",
    ", this frustration relates to the disordered short - range coexistence of two competing species : `` voids '' ( regions with @xmath37 ) and `` cages '' ( regions with @xmath38 ) .",
    "this contrasts with binary separation scenarios , in which the two species organize over coherent patterns ( `` blobs '' ) of sizeable extent .",
    "the lbe with hierarchical interactions takes the final form @xmath39(\\vec{r},t ) + f_i[\\rho(\\vec{r},t)]\\ ] ] where @xmath40 \\cdot \\vec{c}_i$ ] .",
    "this can be regarded as a dynamic , mean - field model of a non - ideal fluid with multiple density phases .",
    "to assess the viability of the present lbe , we have simulated a 2d dimensional fluid with the following parameters : grid size @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath19 is varied between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting effective potential @xmath47 is shown in fig .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a random perturbation uniformly distributed in the range @xmath50 $ ] . due to the combined effect of kinetic hopping from site",
    "to site ( the left - hand - side of the lbe ) and mode - mode coupling @xcite induced by the non - linear potential @xmath47 , the density distribution spreads out in time , so that an instability is triggered as soon as @xmath19 exceeds the critical threshold @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the maximum and minimum densities as a function of the coupling strength @xmath19 .",
    "this figure highlights a sizeable symmetry breaking of the order of @xmath52 for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "the density gap @xmath55 starts up at @xmath56 and rapidly fills the available range of states between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as the interaction strength is increased .",
    "the scaling law is approximately @xmath59 in accordance with mean - field theory . the critical value estimated on the basis of the stability condition @xmath60 yields @xmath61 , in a nice agreement with numerical data",
    ". a similar message is sent by the order parameter @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the density fluctuation around its spatial average , which is represented by the dotted line in fig .",
    "inspection of the spatial distribution of the density field @xmath64 shows that this non - zero order parameter is not associated with phase - separation , but rather with a disordered coexistence of voids and cages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the potential allows to model sharp density contrasts over a disordered spatial distribution .    as",
    "a further observable , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the density - density correlation : @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the curve has been obtained upon averaging the quantities @xmath67 over ten independent runs with different initial configurations .",
    "the error bars show the maximum errors on the values @xmath67 at each value of @xmath68 .",
    "this function exhibits oscillating - decay behavior .",
    "being in a lattice , it is clear that data are only available at discrete positions @xmath69 .",
    "the small error bars and the non - oscillating behavior of @xmath67 in the absence of potential , which is virtually zero as a consequence of the uniform and constant density distribution , suggest that the observed oscillations in the case @xmath70 are not a numerical artifact . however , only further simulations of larger systems can confirm this result .    in order to look for the existence of slow relaxation modes , we computed the density - density time - correlation function @xmath71 ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] )",
    "@xmath72 taken at @xmath73 . in the above , @xmath74 denotes a time average .",
    "we have run ten independent simulations starting from different initial configurations , and we computed @xmath71 in each run .",
    "these individual quantities were first averaged over time intervals of @xmath75 time - steps in order to eliminate high frequencies , and then the final average over the ten runs was taken .",
    "these quantities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where the error bars represent the maximum error on the values of @xmath71 .",
    "we find persistent oscillations around zero , possibly reflecting an everlasting competition between the various density minima of the potential over the timescale of the simulation .",
    "the case @xmath76 shows an immediate decay to zero of the time - correlation function , reflecting the fast relaxation towards a uniform distribution when no potential is acting on the system .",
    "we have presented a new mesoscopic lattice boltzmann model with a density - dependent hierarchy of attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "the long - time dynamics of this model yields disordered patterns with sharp short - range density contrasts , as opposed to binary phase - separation scenarios .",
    "such configurations do not relax towards a frozen state , but continuously change preserving a disordered spatial structure .",
    "the present results show that one distinguishing feature of disordered behavior , namely frustration , can be modeled within the framework of a suitable one - body effective kinetic theory . on the other hand",
    ", the same results also show that further crucial signatures of glassy behavior , such as slow time - relaxation , are not captured by the present hierarchical model . at this point ,",
    "the main question is : what major ingredients of glassy dynamics are we missing in the present model ?    according to palmer et al @xcite , a successfully theory of glassy relaxation should satisfy three basic requirements : ( 1 ) the theory must be based on _ dynamics _ , and not just statistics , because since glasses break ergodicity , equilibrium distributions are of scanty use . (",
    "2 ) the above dynamics must be _ constrained _ , because there is no reasonable hope to diagonalize such highly non - linear systems into independent modes . and",
    "finally , ( 3 ) the theory should be _ hierarchical _ , so that slow modes can adiabatically enslave the fast ones , while the fast modes , in return , set constraints on the dynamics of the slow ones .",
    "our hierarchical lb model does indeed _ generically _ meet with all of these three requirements , but only incompletely .",
    "the model is dynamic , but nonetheless based on a single - time relaxation to local equilibrium .",
    "our model is also non - linear and hierarchically constrained , but still within the class of effective one - body theories .",
    "such effective one - body theories prove exceedingly successful for simple fluids , but it might be that the physics of glasses , and particularly dynamic inhomogeneity @xcite , is just too intimately related to many - body effects which are beyond the reach of effective mean field theories , no matter how ingenious .",
    "we believe that , independently of the computational pay - offs discussed earlier in this work , this latter question bears a significant theoretical interest on its own .",
    "work in this direction is currently underway .",
