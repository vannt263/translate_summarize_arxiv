    "quasi - periodically forced systems could be considered as one of the simplest class of `` essentially non - autonomous '' dynamical systems . in this class of systems , surprisingly complex dynamical phenomena , including rather common existence of strange non - chaotic attractors(sna ) , were reported in early 1980s @xcite . since",
    "then the feature and the mechanism of such phenomena have been extensively studied by many researchers with various background , and related phenomena have been uncovered in relatively wide variety of systems @xcite .",
    "major part of the theoretical researches on the phenomena have been done mainly for the cases with systems with `` forced '' invariant set induced by something like symmetry @xcite . on the other hand , also for the systems without such forced invariant sets , rigorous results are obtained however mainly in reversible 1 + 1-dimensional systems : the existence of sna is indicated for the case where the existence of continuous attractor is excluded by topological constraint@xcite and the emergence of sna at non - uniform saddle - node bifurcation is proven @xcite . as for higher dimensional and/or irreversible systems , also where large part of the numerical studies have been done , there still many phenomena which have not been understood clearly .    when a quasi - periodic external force is applied to such systems that possibly exhibit chaotic behavior even without external forcing",
    ", it seems natural to expect that unstable invariant sets with complicated structure would play essential role in the dynamics@xcite . in quasi periodically forced circle map system with relatively strong modulation (",
    "thus it is no longer reversible ) , existence of such complicated structure is indicated using densely distributed winding number of the orbits@xcite . also in numerical researches , repelling invariant sets with complicated structure are observed , for example , as a basin boundaries between two distinct attractors , and the boundary crisis has been identified as one of the routes to sna .",
    "thus such repelling invariant sets are considered to be directly relevant with the emergence of sna at least for such cases .    in some other cases ,",
    "the existence of repelling sets is also strongly suggested from observation of the parameter dependence of the size or the smoothness of the attractor ( i.e. , crisis - like drastic enlargement of an attractor or `` fractalization '' of a torus ) , while there seem to be no visible basin boundary in its neighborhood . in such cases",
    "it is not trivial task to identify and to locate such presumed repellers .",
    "one possible approach to locate such invariant sets is to consider a perturbation to the invariant sets in the system without external forcing .",
    "however , this method is applicable only for limited class of invariant sets ( i.e. , a torus or composition of multiple tori ) .",
    "another useful approach is to approximate the quasi - periodic forcing with periodic one@xcite , and thus approximate 1 + 1-dimensional skew - product system with 1-parameter family of 1-dimensional autonomous systems .",
    "this method , known as rational approximation ( ra ) method , have been used as a major tool to observe such invariant sets in numerical researches .",
    "it has been used for the classification of the bifurcation to create sna in qplm @xcite , and corresponding types of bifurcation are observed also in qp - forced higher dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "though the observed features of the `` repeller '' obtained in ra are consistent with the qualitative changes of the behavior of the attractors on the whole , ra can not reproduce the topological structure of the genuine `` repeller '' verbatim , and the correspondence of the bifurcations in qp - forced systems and those obtained by ra is somewhat obscure .    in this report",
    ", we propose a method to locate and to obtain the images of repellers in qp - forced logistic map system(qplm ) including those with non - trivial structures , and exhibit some of the numerical results obtained with this method .",
    "our results are consistent with the bifurcation scenario that have been inferred from ra method or from direct observation of the attractors , and provide some novel perspective to bifurcation phenomena where various repellers are involved .",
    "our method is presented in section 2 .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary dynamical system describing the evolution of a segment , that is given as a 1 + 2 dimensional skew - product map system , and describe outline of the method to identify `` repeller '' of the qplm .",
    "some details of the algorithm is given in the the appendix .",
    "some of the numerical results obtained with this method are demonstrated in section 3 , including detailed phase diagram exhibiting a complicated bifurcation structure near tdt(torus doubling termination ) critical point , as well as images of repellers with non - trivial structure .",
    "summary and short discussion will be given in the last section .",
    "in this section , we will explain our method to obtain the images of `` repellers '' in qplm . in the first place ,",
    "we introduce concrete form of the system and auxiliary `` segment map '' , a 1 + 2- dimensional skew - product map that describes the evolution of a `` segment '' in the phase space of qplm .",
    "then we describe the method to obtain repellers in qplm .",
    "some technical details of the algorithm to obtain the images of repellers , together with a method to distinguish sna from `` smooth '' torus will be given in appendix .",
    "here we consider the quasi - periodically forced logistic ( quadratic ) map in the following form , @xmath0,@xmath1 , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are treated as control parameters , and @xmath6 is fixed as @xmath7 in this paper .    in order to examine the stability of a point in @xmath8",
    ", it would be a natural approach to consider the temporal evolution of its neighborhood .",
    "regarding the trivial neutral stability in the @xmath9 direction , it seems reasonable to think about the evolution of a vertical segment that contains the target point .",
    "fortunately the evolution of a vertical segment can be written concretely as a ( 1 + 2)-dimensional piece - wise polynomial skew - product map system .",
    "thus here we introduce an auxiliary `` segment map '' system , given as @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 here @xmath9 is the `` phase '' of the external force as in the qplm([eq : qplm ] ) . @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the center position and the half - length of the segment respectively .",
    "although the derivative of this map has discontinuity on @xmath15 , we have observed no symptom of pathological phenomena due to this discontinuity .",
    "note that , the subspace of zero - length segments ( @xmath16 ) is kept invariant by the map @xmath17 , and the restriction of @xmath17 on @xmath18 could be naturally identified with qplm ( @xmath19 on @xmath8 ) .",
    "we sometimes call a subset of the phase space with common @xmath9 value as a `` fiber '' ( both for qplm and for the segment map system ) . for a point @xmath20 , the length of the corresponding segment in @xmath8 ( @xmath21 ) is written as @xmath22 . for a point @xmath23 in @xmath24 , we let @xmath25 to represent a set ( segment ) @xmath26 . similarly , for @xmath27 which is a subset of @xmath28 , let @xmath29 stands for @xmath30 . we call @xmath29 as the `` shadow '' of @xmath27 . for an invariant set ( that may or may not be an attractor ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 may be either @xmath8 or @xmath28 , we let @xmath33 denote the basin of attraction @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the @xmath6-limit set of the orbit starting from @xmath36 .",
    "now let us describe the outline of the method to detect and to locate `` repellers '' .",
    "our basic strategy is to find a set of points that are transversely unstable and non - wandering , using the map describing temporal evolution of a line segment .",
    "as for the transverse stability of a point , we observe asymptotic behavior of an orbit ( of the segment map ) starting from a segment ( with positive length ) containing the point , and check if the length of the segment would converge to 0 or not .",
    "if it converges to 0 , that indicates no transversely unstable point is contained in the initial segment .",
    "on the other hand , if the length of the orbit starting from the segment has a positive limsup value , transversely unstable point(s ) presumably exist in the initial segment .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the orbit of the segment map gives some information about the recurrence property of the points in the initial segment as well .",
    "as the @xmath6-limit set of an orbit of the segment map is an invariant set , its shadow determines a corresponding invariant set of the original qplm .",
    "if the initial segment ( i.e. , a segment in qplm corresponding to the shadow of the initial point of the segment map ) is a subset of this invariant set , there should exist non - wandering points in the initial segment .",
    "thus we are interested in such point ( @xmath37 ) that satisfies    * @xmath6-limit set of any orbits ( of @xmath17 ) starting from a point corresponding to non - zero length segment containing the point @xmath37 is detached from @xmath38 plane , * the shadow of the @xmath6-limit set contains the point @xmath37    above mentioned @xmath6-limit set for starting point corresponding to sufficiently short segments is expected to be one of the attractors of the segment map .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the attractor .",
    "the ensemble of orbits starting from a neighborhood of the original point @xmath37 should be dense in the shadow of the attractor @xmath39 .",
    "thus the shadow of the attractor @xmath39 could be regarded as a `` basin of repulsion '' of the repelling non - wandering point @xmath37",
    ".    there can be multiple repelling non - wandering points with the common `` basin of repulsion '' .",
    "the set of those repelling non - wandering points consist a transitive set .",
    "thus the set as a whole could be identified as a `` repeller '' .",
    "we let @xmath40 denotes a repeller with `` basin of repulsion '' @xmath39 .",
    "basically what we try to obtain is a image of the section of repellers on a target fiber . in order to do this",
    ", we try to carry out the following steps .",
    "* obtain the list of pull back attractors of the segment map on the target fiber , * find pull back attractors that correspond to a segment whose proper subset corresponds to another pull back attractor , * look for such points which are in the shadow of the outer attractor and whose corresponding @xmath6-limit set does not belong to any of inner attractor s shadow .",
    "the obtained set of points would be the section of the repeller whose basin of repulsion is given by the shadow of the outer attractor . in practice , we try to obtain the image of multiple sections of the repellers using the information of pull back attractors on one fiber .",
    "the detail of the procedure is described in the appendix .",
    "it should be noted that a pull back attractor on a fiber does not simply correspond to a section of the attractor in autonomous 2-dimensional system.@xcite if @xmath41 is an asymptotically stable attractor of @xmath19 in the view the 2-dim autonomous system , boundary of @xmath39 would consist of graph(s ) of continuous and piece - wise smooth function of @xmath9 . in such cases , the intersection of @xmath39 with a certain fiber @xmath42 should coincide with a pull back attracting set on the fiber ( which may consists of multiple pull back attractors ) . on the other hand , for the cases with sna , although pull - back attractor(s ) for almost all fibers can be obtained just like the above case , the shape of their union over the fibers is not continuous .",
    "thus sna does not simply correspond to an asymptotically stable attractor of the 2-dimensional autonomous systems .",
    "it is not easy to distinguish these two types of pull back attractors from simple observation . for the case of sna , however , there should exist a repelling orbit ( that should be a part of a repeller ) in arbitrarily small neighborhood of the pull back attractor@xcite . thus we could expect that there exist trajectories of @xmath17 starting from a point in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of an `` sna '' but finally attracted to another attractor ( of @xmath17 ) that corresponds to the basin of repulsion of the repeller which is located in touch with the attractor(sna ) .",
    "thus , it is expected that snas exhibit a kind of sensitivity of final state against arbitrarily small perturbation in the neighborhood of the attractor in @xmath17 , like those attractors with `` riddled '' basin@xcite .",
    "we try to detect this presumed type of sensitivity of final state in @xmath17 expected for snas , by checking whether a small perturbation for @xmath14 component of @xmath17 would make the destination of the trajectory to another attractor ( in @xmath43 region ) or not . thus we introduce a `` perturbed '' version of segment map @xmath44 , given as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "( @xmath49 is set as @xmath50 in the examples shown in this report . )",
    "in this section , we present some of the numerical results , namely , phase diagrams in @xmath51-plane and visualized images of attractors and repellers for some selected parameter values .",

    "the observed type of the attractor or the repeller is indicated with color as illustrated in the legend box in box ( b ) .",
    "c , t , 2 t and s respectively stand for chaotic , torus , period 2 tori and strange non - chaotic attractor , and `` + r '' indicates the existence of a `` non - trivial '' repeller which is not a part of the basin boundary with other attractors .",
    "[ fig : diagram ]    the obtained phase diagram ( fig.[fig : diagram ] ) seems similar to those obtained in the preceding studies .",
    "however , since our criterion to identify an attractor as sna is different from those used in the preceding studies ( based on the divergence of the estimated phase sensitivity ) , the position of the obtained borderline between smooth attracting torus and sna has some discrepancy",
    ". it would be notable that we observed no sna near the border of the boundary crisis which is associated with the disappearance of bounded attractor in the bump - like region near @xmath58 ( as is shown in box ( c ) ) , which is consistent with the natural expectation that sna appears only at the boundary crisis for such cases .",
    "an example of the repellers with non - trivial structure ( observed as `` ring shaped '' repellers in ra method ) is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical - example ] . besides the apparently fractal layered structure",
    ", thin apertures can be observed in the rim of the rings ( in boxes b and c ) .",
    "these thin apertures are mapped to the large gap near @xmath59 ( indicated by a two - way arrow in box a ) , after 15 ( for box b ) and 28 ( for box c ) iterations .",
    "the above result suggests that the repeller has a family of infinitely many apertures ( with progressively thin widths ) , and thus when adequately coarse grained it could appear to consist of finite number of chunks .",
    "thus the approximation for the repeller obtained by ra could be a good approximation for the repeller in quasi - periodically forced system , in spite of the fact that the set of finite number of rings can not be invariant in the quasi - periodically forced system .    .",

    "we think that these spikes are a symptom of a non - uniform saddle - node bifurcation , where the attractor of @xmath17 ( which corresponds to the basin of the ring - like shaped repeller ) collide with a saddle .",
    "thus it is surmised that , at the bifurcation of the disappearance of the repeller , the boundary would touch the last component of the repeller on infinitely many fibers simultaneously , while on typical fibers the repeller of qplm with fractal - like structure is still retained .",

    "a similarity between attractors with riddled basin and snas become apparent , and the relevance between various phenomena including `` fractalization of torus '' and `` emergence of ring - like shaped repeller '' and ( easily observable ) bifurcations in the segment map ( i.e. , bifurcations accompanied with qualitative changes of attractors ) are also indicated .    at parameter values where the `` fractalization '' occur , it seems that the transformation from a smooth torus to sna and the emergence of a new repeller occur simultaneously",
