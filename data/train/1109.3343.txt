    "this step consists in the reduction to a case where for a fixed set of coordinates , both the components of @xmath1575 and the random variables @xmath1589 are well controlled .",
    "namely , if @xmath1590 , let @xmath1546 be as in lemma [ le : incompspread ] associated to vector @xmath1575 . then conditioned on @xmath1591 , from hoeffding s deviation inequality , the event that @xmath1592 has conditional probability at least @xmath1593 ( recall that @xmath1575 hence @xmath1522 are independent of @xmath349 ) . in summary , using our choice of @xmath1594 , by lemma [ le : normalincomp ] and , in order to prove , it is sufficient to prove that for all @xmath695 , @xmath1595 where @xmath1596 is the conditional probability given @xmath562 the @xmath752-algebra generated by all variables but @xmath1597 , @xmath1598 , and the event @xmath1599 we may write @xmath1600 where @xmath1601 is independent of @xmath1602 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1603 the idea , originated from @xcite , is now to use the rate of convergence given by the berry - esseen theorem to upper bound this last expression .",
    "[ le : smallballbe ] there exists @xmath1118 such that if @xmath255 are independent centered complex random variables , then for all @xmath695 , @xmath1604    let @xmath1605 , then either @xmath1606 or @xmath1607 is larger or equal to @xmath1608 . also @xmath1609 and similarly with @xmath1610 . hence ,",
    "up to loosing a factor @xmath70 , we can assume with loss of generality that the @xmath1611 s are real random variables .",
    "then , if @xmath160 is a real centered gaussian random variable with variance @xmath1612 , berry - esseen theorem asserts that @xmath1613 in particular , for all @xmath556 and @xmath1614 , @xmath1615 we conclude by using the fact that @xmath160 has a density upper bounded by @xmath1616 .",
