    "this work began in the eighties with an attempt to develop a singular normal surface theory as a means toward solving the word problem for @xmath9manifold groups .",
    "the word problem for @xmath9manifolds can be formulated as a decision problem given a knot - manifold .",
    "a compact , orientable @xmath9manifold with nonempty boundary , each component of which is a torus , is called a _ link - manifold_. if the boundary is connected , then we say it is a _ knot - manifold_. we are interested in algorithms to determine if a given knot- or link - manifold contains an interesting planar surface .",
    "often we are interested in how the planar surface sits within the manifold and for this we use some special terminology .    the isotopy class of a non contractible simple closed curve in a torus",
    "is called a _ slope_. classically , the study of knot - manifolds has been as the exterior of knots embedded in some other manifold .",
    "in such a situation , there is a unique slope on the boundary of the knot - manifold , corresponding to the isotopy class of curves on its boundary that bound a disk in the solid torus neighborhood of the knot .",
    "such a curve is called a meridian . when we are given a knot - manifold along with a slope in a component of its boundary",
    ", we use the term _ meridian _ for the given slope . a slope with geometric intersection _",
    "one _ with the meridian is called a _",
    "longitude_. there are infinitely many longitudes for a meridian , each obtained from any of the others by dehn twists about the meridian .",
    "if @xmath10 is a disk , @xmath11 are distinct points in the interior of @xmath10 , and @xmath12 are pairwise disjoint regular neighborhoods of the points with @xmath13 , then we say that @xmath14 is a _ punctured - disk with boundary @xmath15 and punctures @xmath16_. of course , a punctured - disk is a planar surface but a punctured - disk has a distinguished boundary component , and all other boundary components are called punctures .    in this",
    "setting , the following is the word problem for the fundamental groups of closed @xmath9manifolds .",
    "word problem ( closed @xmath9manifolds ) . _ given a knot - manifold @xmath0 and a meridian on @xmath2 .",
    "decide if a longitude bounds a ( possibly ) singular punctured - disk in @xmath0 with punctures meridians_.    we note that if any longitude bounds a singular punctured - disk , then all longitudes bound a singular punctured - disk .",
    "our approach was to understand singular punctured - disks by considering them as normal surfaces .",
    "one quickly notices that the analogous question for an embedded punctured - disk , which must actually be a disk having no punctures , is the classical unknotting problem .",
    "the unknotting problem was solved for knot - manifolds in @xmath17 by w. haken @xcite , where he showed that given a knot in @xmath17 it can be decided if it is the unknot . on the other hand , there is a curious analogy to link - manifolds , which does not have so fortunate an outcome ; in fact , it is an insoluble problem .",
    "word problem ( finitely presented groups ) . _ given a link - manifold @xmath0 , a component @xmath1 of @xmath2 , and a meridian slope on @xmath1 .",
    "decide if there is a ( possibly ) singular punctured - disk in @xmath0 with boundary slope a longitude in @xmath1 and punctures in @xmath4 or meridians on @xmath1_.    the word problem for finitely presented groups in not solvable ; hence , the preceding is an insoluble decision problem for link - manifolds .    in the last section of this paper ,",
    "we discuss the equivalence of these statements of the word problem with other familiar versions .",
    "being unable to make progress in the case of singular normal surfaces , we decided to investigate if analogous problems for embedded surfaces had solutions and found several interesting questions regarding embedded planar surfaces in knot- and link - manifolds .",
    "unfortunately , at that time , we did not make much progress on these either and laid the problems aside until the late nineties . in the late nineties , we discovered a number of new tools for working with normal surfaces and special triangulations , both of which lend themselves nicely to algorithmic problems .",
    "we soon obtained that given a link - manifold it can be decided if there is an embedded , essential planar surface in the manifold .",
    "we use the term _ essential _ in describing a properly embedded surface in a @xmath9-manifold in this work to mean that the surface is incompressible and is not parallel into the boundary . recall that for link - manifolds ,",
    "an incompressible surface is also @xmath18incompressible or is an annulus ; and if the knot - manifold is irreducible , the annulus must be parallel into the boundary .",
    "it was at that time we returned to these problems .",
    "we delayed writing these results for publication until now .    in section 4",
    "we give the following general result about finding interesting planar surfaces .    given a link - manifold there is an algorithm to decide if it contains a properly embedded , essential , planar surface ; if it does , the algorithm will construct one .",
    "possibly the most interesting aspects of this result are the tools used and the method of its proof .",
    "typically , algorithms using normal surface theory follow a standard format .",
    "firstly , there is an existence step where one shows that if a given manifold contains an embedded surface with a property @xmath19 , then it contains a normal one with this property @xmath19 .",
    "however , at some points in this work , we need to modify the triangulation in order to assure the existence of a normal surface with the desirable property .    secondly , there is a recognition step . the necessary algorithms for recognition that a given normal surface is an essential surface",
    "are given in @xcite ; however , we also use from @xcite that if @xmath20 is an embedded , essential surface and is least weight in its isotopy class , then every normal surface that has its projective representative in the carrier of @xmath20 also is an embedded , essential , normal surface .",
    "the latter result first appeared in @xcite using handle - decompositions and later in @xcite for closed surfaces and triangulations .",
    "thirdly , in the classical approach , the big ( typically , by far the hardest ) step is to show that if there is a surface with a property @xmath19 , then there is one among the fundamental surfaces .",
    "we note that a positive solution to the first two steps places us in the common situation for recursively enumerable problems .",
    "namely , given a @xmath9manifold @xmath0 by a triangulation @xmath7 , all normal surfaces in @xmath0 ( with respect to @xmath7 ) can be constructed .",
    "thus we merrily go about constructing the normal surfaces .",
    "if one with property @xmath19 exists , it is normal and if it is normal , we can recognize it .",
    "thus if the given manifold has such a surface , we will eventually find one .",
    "however , if there is none , we do not know this and do not know when to stop looking .",
    "there are only finitely many fundamental surfaces ; hence , if our surface must be among this finite set , which we can construct straight away , then we have solved the problem .",
    "our algorithms do not have the classical step three ; in fact , we might need to go quite far afield of the fundamental solutions of the given triangulation but we do find a finite set in which to look and all surfaces in this finite set are normal in our given triangulation . in section 4 , the proof is by a method we call a _ re - writing process_. a re - writing process was also used in @xcite ; the re - writing process here is different but is the same principle .",
    "in section 5 , we answer the problem for embedded punctured - disks analogous to the singular problem above for the word problem for finitely presented groups .",
    "it is given in the second of the next two theorems .    given a link - manifold @xmath0 , a component @xmath1 of @xmath2 , and a slope @xmath3 in @xmath1",
    ", there is an algorithm to decide if @xmath0 contains an embedded punctured - disk with boundary having slope @xmath3 and punctures in @xmath4 .",
    "if there is one , the algorithm will construct one .",
    "given a link - manifold @xmath0 , a component @xmath1 of @xmath2 , and a meridian in @xmath1 , there is an algorithm to decide if @xmath0 contains an embedded punctured - disk with boundary having slope of a longitude in @xmath1 and punctures in @xmath4 .",
    "if there is one , the algorithm will construct one .",
    "again , we do not conform to the classical third step of finding our solution among the fundamental surfaces .",
    "moreover , our proof uses an interesting method for link - manifolds ; we use induction on the number of boundary components . for rather subtle reasons",
    ", we can not use induction in section 4 .    besides not using the classical form of proof for the above problems , we also call upon a number of new results on triangulations and new tools in normal surface theory .",
    "we discuss what we need from the literature and provide results necessary for this work in section 3 and later sections .",
    "for example , our methods typically require minimal - vertex triangulations or at least triangulations that have at most one vertex in each boundary component . in some situations we need @xmath6efficient triangulations , which are minimal vertex triangulations for knot- and link - manifolds .",
    "these triangulations are quite general and given a @xmath9manifold via any triangulation , there are algorithms that modify the given triangulation to one of these that fits into our methods . in particular , in section 4 , we generalize a result from @xcite and prove the following prime decomposition theorem , where @xmath21 in the connected sum decomposition means the connected sum of @xmath22 copies of the manifold @xmath23 and @xmath24 for a triangulation @xmath7 stands for the number of tetrahedra of @xmath7 .    given a link - manifold @xmath0 via a triangulation @xmath7 , there is an algorithm to construct a prime decomposition @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nonnegative integers and each @xmath28 is given by a @xmath6efficient triangulation @xmath29 , respectively ; furthermore , @xmath30 .",
    "we also use results from @xcite and @xcite on layered - triangulations of the solid torus and the classification of normal surfaces in minimal layered triangulations of the solid torus .",
    "this is used in conjunction with triangulated dehn fillings , which were introduced in these same two references .",
    "if we are given a link - manifold @xmath0 with a triangulation @xmath7 , having just one vertex in each boundary component , then for slopes @xmath31 on distinct boundary components of @xmath0 , there is a natural way to triangulate the dehn filling @xmath32 with a triangulation that is @xmath7 on @xmath0 and is a minimal layered - triangulation of each of the solid tori added .",
    "we discuss this and some of the results we use from the literature in section 3 .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basic concepts from normal surface theory ; however , in section 3 , we identify some of the particular concepts and results that we use . among these ,",
    "one which may not be so familiar , is that mentioned above where if @xmath20 is an embedded , essential normal surface and is least weight in its isotopy class , then every normal surfaces that projects into the carrier of @xmath20 is embedded and essential .",
    "we also define and use the length of the boundary of a normal surface . another major tool related to the boundary of a normal surface ,",
    "also used in @xcite , is what we call the a_verage _ l_ength _ e_stimate _ ( ale ) for the boundary of a normal surface . for a manifold @xmath0 with triangulation @xmath7 , there is a constant @xmath33 dependent only on @xmath0 and @xmath7 so that every normal surface of bounded genus has the average length of its boundary no large than @xmath33 ; hence , in particular , for link - manifolds ( under the right conditions ) a normal planar surfaces must have a short boundary slope on some boundary of the link - manifold .",
    "this enables us to find a finite family of ( short ) slopes in which to do dehn fillings and apply an induction hypothesis . in using triangulated dehn fillings in conjunction with ale , we are able to have very strong control on the complexity of our methods",
    ".    among the questions we consider is one to determine if there is a planar normal surface with a prescribed boundary slope on some boundary component .",
    "this and other questions that involve the boundary of the normal surface are called _",
    "boundary conditions_. section 5 considers a theory of normal surfaces with boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , we show that for the triangulations we use , given a slope on the boundary , there is a set of matching equations so that we get a normal solution space having only normal surfaces that meet the given boundary component in the given slope .",
    "we may have closed normal surfaces and surfaces that meet other boundary components in a totally uncontrolled way .",
    "these method can be greatly generalized ; we did not do that here .",
    "we also adapt ale to normal surfaces with boundary conditions in section 5 .    in the last section we return to a discussion of those versions of the word problem given above and what we might call the classical versions .",
    "following the solution of the geometrization conjecture , we know that the word problem for @xmath9manifold groups is solvable ; however , we remain curious as to the existence of a straight forward method , say , in the spirit of the solution to the word problem for the fundamental groups of haken manifolds , given by f. waldhausen @xcite .",
    "we shall assume the reader has familiarity with our notion of triangulations , as well as a basic knowledge of normal surface theory .",
    "the references @xcite serve as good background material for both triangulations from our point of view and basic facts on normal surfaces .",
    "we have , however , collected some facts and background in this section , which are particularly relevant to this work .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of this work is not only the effectiveness of minimal vertex triangulations in understanding the combinatorial and algorithmic problems we encounter but also in enabling us to understand the topology better .",
    "the following is typical of the type of triangulations we like .",
    "@xcite[minvertex - triangs ] suppose @xmath0 is a compact , orientable @xmath9manifold with boundary , no component of which is a @xmath34sphere .",
    "then any triangulation of @xmath0 can be modified to a triangulation having all vertices in @xmath2 and just one vertex in each component of @xmath2 .    a proof is given in both the cited references .",
    "the idea is quite straight forward .",
    "first , there is an algorithm due to r.h .",
    "bing @xcite that can be used to modify a given triangulation to one having all vertices on the boundary .",
    "this step was not mentioned but is necessary in the proof given in @xcite . having all vertices in the boundary ,",
    "then the method of  closing - the - book \" , described in detail in theorem 3.3 of @xcite , finishes the proof .",
    "a manifold having a triangulation with just one vertex ( closed or possibly compact and bounded with just one boundary component ) or a triangulation with all vertices in the boundary and just one vertex in each boundary component ( compact with boundary ) can not have a triangulation with fewer vertices .",
    "we shall refer to such triangulations as _ minimal - vertex triangulations_. this is different from a minimal triangulation of the manifold @xmath0 ; a triangulation @xmath7 of @xmath0 is a _ minimal triangulation _ if and only if for any triangulation @xmath35 of @xmath0 , @xmath36 , where @xmath24 is used to denote the number of tetrahedra of a triangulation . for irreducible @xmath9-manifolds , distinct from @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , minimal triangulations are minimal - vertex triangulations .",
    "we suspect minimal triangulations are also minimal - vertex triangulations for reducible @xmath9manifolds but have not established this .",
    "minimal - vertex triangulations are completely general ; the above theorem shows that any compact @xmath9manifold with boundary ( no component of which is a @xmath34sphere ) admits a minimal - vertex triangulation and a proof is given in @xcite that any closed @xmath9manifold admits a one - vertex triangulation .",
    "we collect here the main results from normal surface theory we will need along with our conventions for notation .",
    "primary sources for this material are @xcite .    if @xmath0 is a @xmath9manifold , a triangulation of @xmath0 selects a family of surfaces called normal surfaces .",
    "typically a normal surface is defined as an embedded surface that meets the tetrahedra of the triangulation in normal triangles and normal quadrilaterals .",
    "an isotopy of @xmath0 that is invariant on the various simplices of the triangulation is called a _",
    "normal isotopy_. a normal isotopy class of normal triangles or of normal quadrilaterals is called a _ triangle type _ or _ quad type _ , respectively .",
    "we caution the reader that with the triangulations we are using , where the simplicies are only embedded on their interiors and may have identifications on their boundaries , an embedded surface is normal if and only if its pull back to the tetrahedra before face identifications is a collection of normal triangles and normal quadrilaterals",
    ".    we shall use standard normal coordinates . in this case",
    ", there are four normal triangle types and three normal quad types for each tetrahedron , giving each normal surface a parametrization with @xmath40 variables , where @xmath41 is the number of tetrahedra in the triangulation .",
    "hence , an embedded normal surface determines a unique nonnegative integer lattice point in @xmath42 .",
    "the triangulation also determines a system of homogeneous linear equations , the _ matching equations _ ; its solution space meets the nonnegative orthant of @xmath42 in a cone called the _ solution cone _ , which we denote @xmath43 .",
    "we say two normal surfaces satisfy the same _ quadrilateral condition _ if they do not meet any one tetrahedron in distinct quadrilateral types ; equivalently , there is an additional set of conditions placed on the coordinates in the solution cone where for each tetrahedron two of the quadrilateral types have been set to zero .",
    "this algebraic condition is also called a quadrilateral condition .",
    "there are @xmath44 possible quadrilateral conditions .",
    "each integer lattice point in the solution cone corresponds to a ( possibly singular ) normal surface .",
    "this correspondence is one - one between embedded normal surfaces in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath7 and the integer solutions in the solution cone that also satisfy a quadrilateral condition .",
    "those points in the solution cone that have norm one in the @xmath45norm ( @xmath46 ) form a compact , convex , linear cell called the _ projective solution space _ for @xmath0 with triangulation @xmath7 , which is denoted @xmath47 .",
    "the solution cone is the cone over @xmath47 with vertex the origin .",
    "each point in the solution cone has a unique projection into projective solution space .",
    "if two points in the solution cone project to the same point in @xmath47 , we say they are _",
    "projectively equivalent_. if @xmath20 is a point in the solution space and @xmath48 is its projection in @xmath47 , then we call the minimal dimensional closed face of @xmath47 containing @xmath48 the _ carrier of @xmath20 _ and denote it by @xmath49",
    ". we will not distinguish notation between an embedded normal surface @xmath20 and its parametrization @xmath20 in @xmath42 .    from the hilbert basis theorem ,",
    "there is a _ unique , minimal _ finite set of integer lattice solutions in @xmath43 , @xmath50 , so that for @xmath20 any integer lattice point in @xmath43 , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a nonnegative integer .",

    "vertex solution_. all vertex solutions must be among any set of fundamental solutions .",
