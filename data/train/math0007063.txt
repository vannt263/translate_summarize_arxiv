    "the differential geometric technique of state feedback linearization has been explored over the past two decades for the purpose of power system control ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea is to perform a co - ordinate transformation of the nonlinear state space system equations and define a new control input so that in the new co - ordinates , the nonlinearities in the plant are either wholly or partially masked .",
    "this formulation may result in linearizations which are valid for large practical operating points of the system , as opposed to a local jacobian linearization about an operating point .",
    "feedback linearization has been applied to the control of power systems represented by the state - space single machine / infinite bus model in two main ways .",
    "the _ input - state _ feedback linearization approach is formulated such that the system state becomes a linear function of a new control input and a new state , while the output ( for our purposes , the terminal voltage ) is still a nonlinear function , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "although this works well for designing stabilizing controllers , the nonlinearities in the output map make it very difficult to achieve good tracking of reference voltage signals .",
    "an alternative to this approach is the _ input - output _",
    "feedback linearization in which the terminal voltage becomes a linear function of a new control input , e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . due to the mathematical complexity of the nonlinear state - space model representing the high - order single machine / infinite bus power system ( a @xmath0 order model ) ,",
    "a simplified @xmath1 order model is used in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an excitation controller / stabilizer is then designed and tested using the high order model of the plant .",
    "the effects of the unmodelled system dynamics and possible shifts in parameters of the plant raise some questions on the effectiveness of the controller .",
    "an inherent drawback of the feedback linearization approach is the non - robustness due to the need for exact knowledge , both in terms of the structure and parameters , of the model of the power system .",
    "adaptive control has been used to compensate for parameter variation in a framework that allows the controller to learn the nonlinearities on - line @xcite . however",
    ", this assumes that the nonlinearities can be parameterized linearly in some unknown parameters @xcite , @xcite .",
    "some power system stabilizers based on adaptive control design techniques have been shown to increase the operating range over which they can provide good control as well as exhibit robustness to parameterized system disturbances @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a design which addresses these problems by working directly with the more accurate @xmath0 order model of the power system .",
    "the nonlinear dynamical system is modelled using multilayer neural networks made of sigmoid type nonlinearities and adjustable weights which are nonlinearly parameterized .",
    "the flexibility provided by the nonlinear parameterization allows for a more realistic representation of the underlying nonlinear power system model .",
    "power system controller designs using neural networks of various configurations exist in the literature and are reported in works like @xcite .",
    "neural adaptive control of feedback linearizable nonlinear systems was first proposed in @xcite and extensively analyzed in @xcite . in these references , the networks were trained using the backpropagation algorithm @xcite ; the nonlinear function approximation capability of neural networks ( see @xcite ) was exploited to model the plant in order to determine an appropriate feedback linearizing control .",
    "however , the approach used in @xcite , @xcite provides no clear way of specifying closed loop dynamics . in this work the neural network identifier is trained in batch form and adapted using the levenberg - marquardt optimization ( as in @xcite ) rather than using standard backpropagation .",
    "also , the whole control problem is formulated such that tracking dynamics can be user - specified by approprately assigning closed loop system poles .",
    "weight adaptation based on nonlinear optimization is attractive here because it significantly corrects some of the defects of standard backpropagation , most importantly slow rate of convergence . in this framework , the trained neural networks give an on - line estimate of the parameters of the power system at every sampling instant which are then used to calculate the feedback linearizing control law . the controller is designed to provide reference tracking ( with bounded state ) , damping of power angle oscillations and tolerate variations in the plant parameters .",

    "the class of systems to which this model belongs and which motivates the choice of a neural identifier is determined .",

    "the step change takes place at @xmath159 second and the response is depicted in fig .",
    "[ diff_excitation ] .",
    "it is observed that similar transient response characteristics are obtained compared to the response to a perturbation about the nominal operating point as shown in fig .",
    "[ all_excitation ] . also the control effort @xmath17 is less for the neural controller than for the analytic controller . finally , observe that in both fig .",
    "[ all_excitation ] and fig .",
    "[ diff_excitation ] , the magnitude of the rotor angle oscillations for the neural excitation controller mimics the behaviour of the system under no control in response to a small perturbation .",
    "this is due to fact that feedback linearization was applied to a @xmath38 order system , as opposed to a @xmath160 order , as done with analytic feedback linearization .",
    "hence , the effect of excitation control is almost completely decoupled from the mechanical modes of the system .",
    "* excitation controller / power system stabilizer : * in @xcite , the control law used for the power system stabilizer is given by @xmath161 giving voltage tracking dynamics : @xmath162 with gains @xmath163 these values are determined by a root locus criterion ( see @xcite ) in order to obtain optimal damping of rotor angle oscillations .",
    "recall that the control law for the neural adaptive controller / power system stabilizer is given by @xmath164 where the gain @xmath106 is given by @xmath165 for the simulations which follow , @xmath166 in general , increasing @xmath167 has the effect of improving the damping on @xmath168 for step changes in reference signal .",
    "however @xmath167 can not be assigned arbitrarily large values .",
    "for instance , values of @xmath167 much higher than @xmath169 have the effect of making the system unstable .",
    "the output of the system is originally at the nominal value of @xmath170 .",
    "a step change of @xmath171 in reference voltage occurs at @xmath151 seconds .",
    "observe from fig .",
    "[ perf_all ] that the neural controller accurately tracks the reference signal ( actually , tracking error is 0.0082 % after 2.8 seconds ) and quickly damps out the rotor angle oscillations .",
    "as done for the excitation controller , the controller / pss is validated for a change in operating point to @xmath157 and a step change of @xmath172 p.u .",
    "takes place at @xmath151 seconds .",
    "dynamic behaviour similar to that in fig .",
    "[ perf_all ] are obtained for both controllers . the figure depicting the tracking and stabilizing dynamics for this new operating point",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ perf_all_diff ]    the neural controller was also tested for big changes in the operating points of the system as follows : a step increase in @xmath173 from @xmath174 to @xmath175 was introduced at @xmath176 .",
    "after @xmath177 seconds , @xmath173 dropped to @xmath178 fig .",
    "[ perf_all_plus ] depicts the results for both the neural and analytic controllers .",
    "both controllers performed well and exhibited similar tracking dynamics compared to the response to a small step change in reference voltage shown in fig .",
    "[ perf_all ] .    the tuned analytic controller described above exhibits high frequency harmonics during tracking due to the effects of the unmodelled dynamics in the design phase",
    ". the neural model does not exhibit such pronounced oscillations .",
    "also observe that the control effort ( @xmath17 in figs .",
    "[ perf_all ] and [ perf_all_plus ] ) is several orders of magnitude higher for the analytic controller than for the neural controller .",
    "finally , observe that the steady state tracking error is effectively zero in both cases and the speed of response is comparable .",
    "another set of tests done on the control system involves the inertia parameter @xmath12 drifting from its nominal value of @xmath179 to about @xmath180 ( i.e. a @xmath181 drift ) to see how well the control system behaves when feedback linearization is inexact .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figs_vary ] .",
    "the neural controller performs better than the analytic controller in this case since the analytic controller design was based on exact knowledge of all the parameters of the plant .",
    "it is observed that the tracking dynamics of the neural controller is essentially the same as what we have in fig .",
    "[ perf_all ] , where the parameter @xmath182 . for this test",
    ", the value of @xmath167 in ( [ nu_eqn ] ) is reduced to @xmath183 . for arbitrary variation in the parameters",
    ", the neural controller performance can be improved by reducing the size of the deadzone used in the adaptation algorithm so that weights are updated for values of @xmath95 less than @xmath112 in this particular case .",
    "the system performance under a disturbance is investigated by forcing the mechanical power input , @xmath184 to drop suddenly by @xmath185 ( from 1.6512 to 1.1 ) ; the response is shown in fig .",
    "[ figs_disturb ] . observe that both controllers recover quickly and restore the terminal voltage @xmath19 to its nominally value .",
    "the rotor angle changes to a new value but still retains its damping . in this case",
    "both controllers gave the same level of performance , although the tracking dynamics for the neural controller is just slightly better .",
    "we note that in practice this may be a rather drastic change in power level , but the simulation is done just to see how far the system may be `` pushed '' whilst still maintaining control action .",
    "finally , the effect of on - line weight adaptation on the response of the overall control system is investigated by observing the rate at which the error adaptation occurs . the fig .",
    "[ figs_with_error ] shows how quickly the plant output error @xmath186 is adapted for the parameter variation , disturbance and normal excitation controller / power system stabilizer tests .",
    "observe that the errors are not too large ( apart from that associated with system disturbance ) and are adapted quickly . therefore it is concluded that adapting the weights online does not unduly slow down the response of the overall control system .",
    "a neural adaptive feedback linearizing excitation controller/ power system stabilizer has been proposed for a high - order model of the synchronous machine / infinite bus power system .",
    "the controller provides tracking performance with less high frequency harmonics than an analytic controller based on a reduced - order model of the system and would seem to tolerate parameter drift . in the cases considered , step changes in reference voltage are tracked , with the neural controller requiring significantly less control effort than the analytic controller .",
    "the neural controller also provides damping of power angle oscillations with similar voltage and power angle transient characteristics over different operating points of the system .",
    "also on - line controller adaptation does not slow down the overall control system response since output errors are reduced quickly .",
    "the advantage of this approach lies in the fact that exact knowledge of the power system dynamics is not absolutely necessary and the system state need not all be measurable .",
    "also , the complicated mathematical mapping required to carry out analytic feedback linearization is avoided .",
    "the control scheme is quite straightforward and easy to synthesize .",
    "thorough mathematical analyses guaranteeing convergence and/or stability for this type of control scheme ( comparable to that reported in @xcite ) is still to be done .",
