    "the maxi lightcurve ( panel a ) has a profile of fast rise and exponential decay ( fred ) as seen in many of the black hole transients in the soft x - ray band ( @xcite ) .",

    "it may be noted that the pca had no observations during most part of the plateau phase observed in maxi during mjd 55812 to mjd 55820 . had this plateau not been there , the whole lightcurve profile would have been a typical fred .",

    "the decay time is estimated to be of 32 days .",
    "the swift bat lightcurve in the energy band of 15 - 50 kev ( panel c ) exhibits that , the flux of hard photons initially did rise to a peak upto mjd 55810 , but the flux reduced later to a minimum on mjd 55820 .",
    "the hard flux is again observed to increase upto mjd 55830 , although not upto the same level as previous rise on mjd 55810 .",

    "the decrease in hard photons is observed simultaneously as shown in panel c of figure [ lc ] .",
    "this suggests that the spectra is softening during the rise as the outburst progresses .",
    "the trend in the value of t@xmath12 obtained from the fits is indicative of disk flowing inward although the data considered are above 3 kev only .",
    "also , @xcite and @xcite have already pointed out that since the parameter of disk radius does vary because of change in spectral hardening factor the diskbb model parameters are found to be not a correct representative of the spectra . during mjd 55821 to mjd 55846 , the disk temperature varies from 0.8 kev to 1.4 kev while the photon index reduces from 1.8 to 1.4 .",
    "this reduction in photon index implies the hardening of the spectra during the decay .    in panel a of figure [ spec_par ]",

    "the flux values over these energies are obtained after the spectral fits to each of the pca data sets using the _ flux _ command .",
    "we observe that during the rising phase of the outburst , the hardness ratio reduces from 0.86 ( mjd 55804 ) to 0.58 ( mjd 55820 ) , suggesting the spectral softening . the variation in hardness can also be seen in top panel of figure [ hid - rms ] ( see also figure 3 of @xcite ) . during this phase the total rms of the pds",
    "reduces from 24% to 19% . from mjd 55821",
    "to mjd 55838 , the hardness ratio is observed to increase from 0.63 to 0.99 .",
    "we observe that this is accompanied by the variation in the total rms of the pds around 19% and @xmath1425% ( bottom panel of figure [ hid - rms ] ) .",
    "the values of disk temperature , photon index , hardness ratio and total rms suggests that the source would have occupied a hard - intermediate state during this phase . from mjd",
    "55389 onwards , the hardness ratio remains around 1 and the rms of the pds increases to a maximum of 28% .",
    "also the diskbb component is not necessary for the spectral fitting .",
    "these suggest the spectral hardening and that the source enters the hard state .",
    "the variation of flux for the different model components in figure [ flux - frac ] shows that the powerlaw emission has a major contribution during the entire outburst with an intial contribution of @xmath1560% and then dominating the entire spectra completely during the end phase of the outburst . during the initial rise from mjd 55804 to mjd 55820",
    ", both powerlaw flux and disk flux are seen to increase ( see figure [ break - flux ] ) . the disk flux and",
    "the 3 - 20 kev flux becomes maximum around the peak of the outburst ( top panel of figure [ lc ] ) .",
    "thus from the spectral analysis , it is evident that the source exhibits spectral state transitions . during the initial rise from mjd 55804 , the source occupies a low / hard state .",
    "the source is definitely in a hard - intermediate state ( hims ) on mjd 55818 as indicated by the hardness ratio , though where it enters the hims can not be exactly determined .",
    "it continues in the hard - intermediate state till mjd 55840 after which the hardness ratio remains @xmath18 1 , and the source thus decays to a low / hard state .",
    "ergs @xmath4 sec@xmath5,width=340 ]",
    "it is evident from the spectral and timing analysis that the source maxi j1836@xmath0194 exhibits spectral state transition . during the rising phase , the source probably occupies a hard state on mjd 55804 , although the vertical portion of the hid diagram ( figure [ hid - rms ] ) is not observed . from the same figure it is clear that the source travels along an almost horizontal track towards lower hardness ratios . around mjd 55818",
    "hardness ratio is @xmath19 0.6 and clearly the source is in a hard - intermediate state .",
    "the return to hard state after mjd 55840 is more like a typical decay of hid to quiescent state .",
    "the above state transition is also supported by the fact that there is a disk contribution to the spectral fit also .",
    "figure [ flux - frac ] clearly shows that the contribution of disk component attains a maximum of 16.5% .",
    "the thermal flux contribution never reaches anywhere close to the 80% which is typically observed in black hole binaries while in a fully ( canonical ) soft state @xcite .",
    "although the hard power law component dominates the total flux contribution throughout the outburst , clearly the presence of the soft component is necessary in the spectral fit .",
    "this is further strengthened by the contribution of the fe line flux albeit small .",
    "it may also be noted that the contribution of soft component flux is much higher than observed in other sources like swift j1753.5@xmath00127 @xcite and xte j1118@xmath20480 , gro j0422@xmath2022 @xcite , which remain in the hard state throughout their outbursts and are termed as ` failed ' outbursts .. similar spectral analysis have been conducted by @xcite for maxi j1836@xmath0194 , and have termed this as a failed outburst . in our analysis",
    "we stress the feature that the source did reach the hard intermedite state and this is supported by the concurrent temporal features also .",
    "the trend of increase in break frequency is another parameter which is indicative of the source entering the hard intemediate state as seen in figure [ break - flux ] , and is also supported by the total rms values of the pds as shown in figure [ hid - rms ] .",
    "however , it is also observed that the break frequency instead of increasing further as would be expected of a source entering soft state , it starts to decrease after mjd 55820 .",
    "the qpo frequency and its q- factor also are highest on the same day .",
    "the temporal evolution of the source shows that the break frequency evolves with time .",
    "panel c of figure [ lc ] shows that the hard photons reduce drastically on mjd 55820 when the break frequency has reached its maximum .",
    "this suggests the increase in soft flux , which has been observed simultaneously in figure [ break - flux ] as mentioned in  [ sec : res ] .",
    "previous studies of gx 339@xmath04 by @xcite have shown that the break frequency increases while in the intermediate states , which is similar to what we observe in maxi j1836@xmath0194 . until now different theories have been developed to understand the nature of break frequency evolution @xcite .",
    "almost all the theories connect the origin of the break frequency with fluctuations in the inner boundary of a keplerian disk .",
    "@xcite compared the evolution of inner disk radius and break frequency as suggested by @xcite .",
    "but we are unable to do the same for this outburst , since the source does not enter a predominant soft state .",
    "evolution of the break frequency suggests that some oscillation occurs in the region where the keplerian flow gets truncated .",
    "figure [ break - flux ] shows that the break frequency is maximum when the disk flux is around its peak .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed only for very few observations during the outburst as seen in figure [ qpo_evo ] . during this period ,",
    "the inner disk temperature t@xmath12 varies from 0.62 kev to @xmath21 0.8 kev and the photon index is @xmath14 1.9 .",
    "this is when the source exists in the hard intermediate state .",
    "the qpos are seen when the disk flux has reached a maximum and the spectral index has also increased .",
    "the variations in different temporal parameters over days have been summarized in the table [ t1 ] .",
    "qpos are observed during mjd 55819 to 55822 .",
    "the observation on mjd 55823 does not show the presence of qpos .",
    "the next two observations on mjd 55824 and mjd 55825 show significant qpos in their pds with decreased peak frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note that the qpo frequencies observed in low / hard transients by @xcite have been in the range of mhz to 1 hz , while for maxi j1836@xmath0194 we find that the qpo frequency is @xmath14 3 to 5 hz , which is higher than those observed for other low / hard transients . for sources which exhibit canonical outburst , qpo frequencies observed are up to 10 hz ( e.g. xte j1859@xmath20226 ; @xcite ) , or occassionally even more extending to 20 hz(e.g .",
    "xte j1748@xmath0288 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this source therefore appears to be the second source which entered the hims but does not reach the soft state .",
    "similar features have been observed in h 1743@xmath0322 during its october 2008 outburst @xcite .",
    "this source therefore appears to be the second source which entered the hims but does not reach the soft state .",
    "both maxi j1836@xmath0194 and h 1743@xmath0322 enter a hard intermediate state and exhibit low frequency qpos in the few hz range .",
    "these are the two sources which have exhibited hims after the hard state , as compared to other sources with failed outbursts which remain in hard state only ( swift j1753.5@xmath00127 ; @xcite , xte j1118@xmath20480 , gro j0422@xmath2022 ; @xcite ) .",
    "maxi j1836@xmath0194 was softest on mjd 55820 and h 1743@xmath0322 was softest on mjd 54764 .",
    "one other curious feature of the two sources is that the qpos are not observed on one day ( mjd 55823 for maxi j1836@xmath0194 and mjd 54764 for h 1743@xmath0322 ) and after that the soft component decreases for both the sources . for maxi j1836@xmath0194 ,",
    "a radio flare was observed at 2011 september 20 09:50:24.0 ut on mjd 55824.42 by ratan-600@xcite , while for h 1743@xmath0322 there is no report of a peak radio flare close to mjd 54764 although there has been detection of a radio counterpart on 2008 october 7 @xcite . observations and results suggests that the observation of qpo not being observed in the pds on mjd 55823 is probably correlated with the subsequent detection of a radio flare of 50 mjy on mjd 55824.42 .",
    "there have been reports of qpo being not observed in the pds of black hole binaries whenever a flare occurs ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we conclude from the analysis of rxte observations of maxi j1836@xmath0194 that    * the source exhibits state transition of hard state @xmath22 hard intermediate state @xmath22 hard state * the source never occupies a soft state during the outburst but does reach hims , and therefore belongs to the category of few sources which enter hims but do not reach the soft state . *",
    "qpos are observed for a short duration when the source exists in the hard intermediate state * the evolution of break frequency is also observed which is linked with the disk characteristics",

    "<S> we present the results of analysis of the x - ray transient source maxi j1836@xmath0194 during its outburst in august 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> maxi gsc detected the source on 30th august 2011 , when it started rising from the quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the source using the observations of rxte . in this paper , we study the temporal and spectral evolution of the source during the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> spectral analysis shows that the source exhibits state transition to hard intermediate state(hims ) and decays back to a low / hard state . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal analysis indicates the presence of qpos during the hard intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe correlation between the evolution of break frequency with respect to the spectral characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this is probably the second source after h 1743@xmath0322 which exhibits transition to hims but does not reach soft spectral state . </S>"
