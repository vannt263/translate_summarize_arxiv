    "in today s metropolitan transportation systems , congestion is one of the major problems .",
    "traffic congestion causes delayed travel times as well as more energy consumption . in fact , the average of yearly delay per auto commuter due to congestion was 38 hours , and it was as high as 60 hours in large metropolitan areas in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the congestion caused 2.9 billion gallons of wasted fuel in 2011 , and this figure keeps increasing yearly @xcite , _",
    "e.g. , _ the increase was 3.8% in illinois between years 2011 and 2012 , @xcite .",
    "this trend poses a challenge for efficient transportation systems in terms of delay and energy , and new congestion control mechanisms are needed to eliminate this inefficiency .    a straightforward approach to address the congestion problem is to enhance the capacity of transportation systems , which requires significant investment .",
    "on the other hand , it is extremely important to understand the capacity of existing as well as future transportation systems so that ( i ) available resources are effectively and fully utilized , and ( ii ) new transportation systems are developed based on the actual need .",
    "capacity characterization of transportation systems and utilizing available capacity are getting increasing interest recently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is thanks to vehicle automation , which makes utilization of available capacity possible with the communication and coordination abilities of vehicles , enabled by the internet connection @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in this context , it is crucial to take into account practical constraints that arise from real transportation systems while characterizing capacity to fully utilize underlying resources in transportation systems .",
    "one of such practical problems is the blocking problem .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the impact of the blocking problem to transportation systems .",
    "the blocking problem naturally arises in transportation systems as multiple vehicles with different itineraries share available resources .",
    "for example , there may be multiple vehicles that would like to continue straight at an intersection , and they can block the other vehicles that would like to turn left .",
    "the next example illustrates the blocking problem using a canonical example .",
    "[ t ! ]     [ fig : intersection ]    [ example : ex1 ] let us consider fig .",
    "[ fig : intersection ] , which is an example intersection , where vehicles may turn left , go straight , or turn right .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](a ) is a simple queue representation of fig .",
    "[ fig : intersection ] , where one - way single - lane traffic is represented as a first - in - first - out ( fifo ) queuing mechanism , and head - of - line ( hol ) vehicle corresponds to the first vehicle in the queue .",
    "let us assume that the hol vehicle would like to turn right , but left - turn phase is on . in this case",
    ", the hol vehicle blocks the other vehicles that are waiting in the queue , _",
    "i.e. , _ at the intersection . similar blocking behavior could also be observed in more realistic scenarios such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](b ) , where lanes are dedicated to turn right ( and go straight ) or turn left .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](b ) , let us assume that two vehicles are allowed to pass through an intersection when light is on",
    ". however , hol vehicles would like to turn left and right , and the vehicle just behind the hol vehicles would like to go straight . in this case , if left or right light is on , one vehicle can pass , if go - straight light is on , no vehicle can pass .",
    "thus , even though two vehicles are allowed to pass , only one vehicle can pass in the best - case scenario .",
    "a similar argument holds for the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](c ) . as can be seen , blocking occurs in transportation systems , and it increases waiting time and wastes energy .",
    "@xmath1    in this paper , we analyze the effect of the blocking problem to waiting time ( which is related to energy consumption ) at the intersections of transportation systems .",
    "we assume that different vehicles , depending on their internet connection capabilities , may communicate their intentions ( _ e.g. , _ whether they will turn left or right or continue straight ) to intersections ( specifically to devices attached to traffic lights ) .",
    "we consider that information collected by these devices are transmitted to and processed in a cloud - based traffic control system .",
    "thus , a cloud - based system , based on the intention information , can calculate waiting times at intersections",
    ". this calculation would be deterministic if all vehicles could communicate their intentions . however , this is not possible today as only a percentage of devices may have such communication infrastructure . even in a futuristic setup , where all devices have ability of communicating their intentions , some people may prefer not to share this information due to privacy concerns .",
    "thus , we consider a hybrid system model , where arbitrary number of devices can communicate their intentions . in this setup ,",
    "our goal is to ( i ) calculate average waiting time by taking into account the blocking problem , and ( ii ) find shortest routes / paths in terms of waiting times .",
    "the following are the key contributions of this work :    * we investigate the impact of blocking problem in transportation systems by modeling arriving and departing vehicles at an intersection as a queuing model . in particular , we investigate two queuing models ; single - lane model in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](a ) and one+two lane model in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](b ) . for each model , we characterize average waiting times by taking into account the vehicles that can communicate their intentions ( to turn left , right , or go straight ) and blocking probability . * we design an algorithm that finds the routes ( or set of intersections ) between a starting and ending points with shortest delay .",
    "the shortest delay algorithm that we design takes into account the average waiting times at intersections , hence blocking probabilities .",
    "* we evaluate our algorithm via simulations for a multiple - intersection transportation network .",
    "the simulation results confirm our analysis , and show that our shortest delay algorithm significantly improves over blocking - unaware schemes .",

    "analyzing waiting times and modeling transportation systems using queueing theory have a long history ( more than 50 years ) @xcite .",
    "_ e.g. , _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite considered one - lane queues and calculated the expected queue length and arrivals using probability generation functions .",
    "these models focus on fixed - cycle traffic signals , and they calculate the steady - state delays and queue lengths under the assumption that the arriving process does not change over time @xcite .",
    "time - dependent arrivals have also been considered in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "different modeling strategies are also studied ; such as the queuing network model @xcite , cell transmission model @xcite , store - and - forward @xcite , and petri - nets @xcite .",
    "as compared to this line of work , our work considers ( i ) that some vehicles can communicate their intentions , which affects the delay analysis , and ( ii ) blocking problem .",
    "recently , with the development of sensor technology , there is an increasing interest in terms of estimating the average delay and queue length at isolated intersections using the information collected by probing vehicles .",
    "the queue length estimation and estimation error are characterized in @xcite , @xcite , where the probing vehicles can provide their location and entering and departure time in the road intersection to a central controller .",
    "isolated intersection is considered in @xcite , and optimal traffic cycle to adaptively serve two directions of vehicles are calculated .",
    "an optimization scheme is proposed in @xcite by taking into account stochastic features of traffic flows in isolated intersections . as compared to this line of work",
    ", we focus on the impact of blocking problem to waiting times in transportation systems .",
    "there is also an increasing interest in terms of controlling transportation networks by analyzing the network as a whole without focusing on specific intersections .",
    "for example , the control of a network of signalized intersections is discussed in @xcite , with the goal of stabilizing waiting times at intersections by considering the network as a whole and directing vehicles to appropriate intersections . however , this line of work does not take into account the blocking probability and its impact to the waiting times and queue sizes .",
    "we consider a transportation network consisting of multiple intersections .",
    "first , we will focus on an intersection as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : intersection ] as isolated from the rest of the network , and characterize waiting times by taking into account blocking problem . then , we will consider multiple intersections in a network , and determine the shortest delay routes / paths .    in our setup , we model each intersection as a set of queues . for example , in fig .  [",
    "fig : intersection ] , there are four queues for each direction ( for south - north , north - south , west - east , and east - west bounds ) .",
    "we specifically focus one direction in our model ; _",
    "e.g. , _ south - north bound in fig .",
    "[ fig : intersection ] , and model it using two models : , which is one - lane model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](a ) and ; which is a one+two lane model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](b ) .",
    "we consider a time - slotted system , where one vehicle is allowed to leave the queue during one time slot . at each slot",
    ", the arrivals of vehicles are distributed according to poisson distribution . in this setup ,",
    "when a vehicle enters a queue , it can communicate with the intersection and inform its intention in terms of turning left or right or continuing straight .",
    "we call this `` communication ability '' of the vehicle and , we call the probability that a vehicle has communication ability is `` communication probability ''",
    ". _ i.e. , _ each vehicle can communicate with the intersection ( actually with the sensor possibly attached to traffic lights ) with some `` communication probability '' . in this setup ,",
    "if vehicles at an intersection have communication abilities , then the traffic light can arrange its phases accordingly , so _ blocking is avoided_. otherwise , the traffic light selects a phase randomly , and _ blocking may occur_.    now , let us explain our queuing models ;   and   in detail .",
    "[ [ section ] ]     is a queuing model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](a ) . in this setup , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 correspond to arrival rates of vehicles that would like to turn left , continue straight , and turn right .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will assume in the rest of the paper that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "in this setup , if the head - of - line ( hol ) vehicle at time slot @xmath8 has communication ability , then there is no blocking in slot @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the hol vehicle does not have communication ability , traffic phases for left , straight , and right are `` on '' with probability @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "thus , if hol vehicle would like to turn left , but traffic phase turn right is `` on '' , then blocking occurs .",
    "we consider in our model that @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is pre - determined and independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) over time slots .    in this setup ,",
    "arrival traffic is poisson and departure is any general traffic .",
    "thus , we can model this queue according to m / g/1 queue . however , the analysis is not straightforward due to blocking effect .",
    "we present the details in section  [ sec : waiting_time ] .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    our second queuing model is , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : queuemodels](b ) . in this setup , to demonstrate the analysis in a simple way , we consider that the right - turning and continuing - straight traffics are combined together .",
    "thus , we consider the arrival rates as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in this model , there are two dedicated lanes for vehicles at the head - of - line ( hol ) , where left - turning vehicles can only join the left lane , while the right - turning or straight - continuing vehicles can only join the going straight lane .",
    "note that to further simplify the terminology , we call both right - turning and straight - continuing vehicles as going - straight vehicles in the rest of the paper . the simplified model is shown in fig .",
    "[ model2 ] .",
    "[ t ! ]    in this setup , at any phase , at least one vehicle is transmitted . however ,",
    "when we consider traffic phases lasting for two slots , either one ( if blocking occurs ) or two ( if there is no blocking ) vehicles are transmitted . in this model , we consider the case that traffic phases change at every two slots , and provide analysis for this setup .",
    "similar to , our goal is to characterize the average waiting time of this model using m / g/1 queues .",
    "the details are provided in the next section .",
    "in this section , we characterize the average waiting time for   and . both queuing models can be modeled as m / g/1 queues .",
    "thus , the average waiting times should follow the pollaczek - khinchine ( pk ) formula : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the average waiting time , @xmath18 is the service time and @xmath19 is the line utilization , @xmath20 .",
    "however , in this formula , it is not straightforward to characterize the expected service time @xmath21 and the second moment of the service time @xmath22 due to different communication abilities of vehicles and blocking .",
    "thus , our main contribution in this section is the characterization of these parameters ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , which we discuss next .      in , if there is a mismatch between the traffic phases and hol vehicle , then blocking occurs . for example ,",
    "if hol vehicle would like to turn left , but traffic phase turn right is `` on '' , then blocking occurs .",
    "this kind of blocking occurs only if hol vehicle does not have communication ability .",
    "thus , we discuss three scenarios with different levels of communication abilities ; ( i ) all vehicles have communication abilities , ( ii ) none of the vehicles have communication abilities , ( iii ) a percentage of vehicles have communication abilities .",
    "note that the first two scenarios are actually the special cases of the third scenario .",
    "however , we present the average waiting time analysis for these scenarios as well in the following to better explain our approach .      since every vehicle has communication ability , the traffic light always knows where the hol vehicle would like to go .",
    "thus , it can arrange the traffic phase accordingly , so the service time @xmath18 in ( [ eq : pk ] ) will be 1 .",
    "thus , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and ( [ eq : pk ] ) is expressed as    @xmath25    where the total arrival rate to the queue is @xmath26 .",
    "note that this is a trivial scenario without any blocking .",
    "next , we consider the case that none of the vehicles have communication abilities .",
    "if none of the vehicles have communication abilities , then the traffic lights randomly choose phases for left , straight or right with probabilities ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , respectively .    in this setup ,",
    "the hol vehicle can take more than one slots to pass the intersection .",
    "therefore , the service time @xmath18 can be any positive integer .",
    "if the service time @xmath27 , @xmath28 , this means that there has been a mismatch between the hol vehicle and the traffic phases in the last @xmath29 slots . therefore , the probability that the vehicle pass the intersection at the @xmath30th slot is @xmath31 $ ] , and it follows the geometric distribution @xmath32=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{3}\\alpha_i ( 1-p_i)^{n-1}p_i\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the probability that the hol vehicle is going to left , straight or right .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath35 .",
    "thus , ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is expressed as @xmath36=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_i(1-p_i)^{n-1}p_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_i}\\ ] ] using ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( the detailed calculations are provided in @xcite ) , which leads to the average waiting time @xmath37 note that the average waiting time for this scenario directly depends on the traffic phase probabilities . this is intuitive as the mismatch between vehicles and traffic lights increases the waiting time , which directly affects the average waiting time .",
    "now , we assume that a percentage of vehicles has communication abilities .",
    "let @xmath38 denotes the communication probability of a vehicle . in this scenario ,",
    "when the hol vehicle has communication ability , then the traffic phases could be arranged accordingly , and the vehicle immediately passes the intersection ( _ i.e. , _ it can take 1 slot to pass the intersection ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the vehicle does not have communication ability , then the traffic phases will be left , straight or right randomly with probabilities @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    in this scenario ,",
    "the service time @xmath39 occurs in two cases .",
    "the first case is that the hol vehicle has communication ability .",
    "the second case is that the hol vehicle does not have communication ability , but the traffic phase is aligned with the direction of the vehicle in the first slot ( note that it may take longer ) .",
    "the probability of the second case is @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the probability that the service time is equal to 1 as @xmath41=p_t+(1-p_t)\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_ip_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_i}\\ ] ]    if the service time is larger than 1 , we know that this only happens when the hol vehicle does not have communication abilities . thus , the calculation for @xmath42 case is similar to the scenario that none of the vehicles have communication abilities .",
    "thus , the probability of service time to be @xmath43 is @xmath44=(1-p_t)\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_i(1-p_i)^{n-1}p_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\lambda_i}\\ ] ] using @xmath31 $ ] in ( [ eq : pxn_2_2 ] ) , we can calculate @xmath21 and @xmath22 as details are provided in @xcite .",
    "then the average waiting time is characterized as @xmath45}{2\\left\\lbrace 1-\\sum_{i=1}^{3}\\left[\\lambda_i p_t+(1-p_t)\\frac{\\lambda_i}{p_i}\\right]\\right\\rbrace}\\ ] ]      now , we consider the characterization of the average waiting time for   shown in fig .",
    "[ model2 ] . in this model",
    ", we consider that traffic phases change at every two slots .",
    "thus , in this two - slot duration , one vehicle passes if there is blocking , and two vehicles can pass if there is no blocking .",
    "similar to , we consider different levels of communication abilities for vehicles ; ( i ) all vehicles have communication abilities , ( ii ) none of the vehicles have communication abilities , and ( iii ) a percentage of vehicles has communication abilities .",
    "next , we present our analysis for each scenario",
    ".      if every vehicle has communication abilities , two vehicles can pass at every two - slot duration .",
    "thus , the service time for vehicles is always 1 .",

    "e.g. , _ an empty left - turning hol location , it can be estimated that the only possible configuration is configuration iv in fig .",
    "[ fig : holconfiguration](d ) .",
    "then , the traffic light can arrange its phase to align with the configuration . on the other hand , if the configurations are configuration ii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : holconfiguration](b ) ) or configuration iii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : holconfiguration](c ) ) , the traffic light will randomly arrange its phases .",
    "based on the discussion above , we know that the service time can be 1 when there is an empty hol location or the traffic phase allows two vehicles go within two slots when there are no empty hol locations .",
    "since the service time can be 1 or 2 when there are no empty hol locations , to calculate the expected service time in this case , we can expand fig .",
