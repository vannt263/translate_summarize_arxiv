    "the motion of the euler top is governed by the euler equation , whose generic orbits are periodic . by applying the stokes theorem to a suitable surface on @xmath1 , montgomery @xcite obtained a berry - hannay - like formula for the angle by which the final position of the euler top is rotated with respect to the initial position after one period ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a different derivation , based on the poinsot description of the motion and the gauss - bonnet theorem , was given by levi @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a third , more elementary derivation , in the sense that it utilizes only basic facts about the euler equation and parallel transport on the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "the basic observation is that the motion of a fixed orthonormal basis as seen in the euler top s frame can be easily understood in terms of the euler flow on a sphere of fixed angular momentum norm and parallel transport on this sphere .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the first section briefly reviews the theory of the euler top ; the main result is proved in the second section , with montgomery s formula deduced as a corollary in the third section ; the fourth section contains an approximate geometric interpretation of the geometric phase for motions starting close to an unstable equilibrium point .",
    "in this section we briefly review the theory of the euler top , mainly to fix the notation .",
    "this material is standard and can be found in almost any book on mechanics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an * euler top * is a rigid body with a fixed point moving freely in an inertial frame .",
    "its motion is described by a curve @xmath2 which at each instant gives the orientation of the body with respect to a reference position .",
    "we have @xmath3 , where @xmath4 can be identified with @xmath5 through the well known linear isomorphism defined by @xmath6 for all @xmath7 .",
    "it is then easily shown that @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the euler top , and hence @xmath9 is the angular velocity as seen in the euler top s frame .",
    "the ( conserved ) total angular momentum of the euler top is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a symmetric , positive definite linear operator whose eigenvalues @xmath12 ( called the * principal moments of inertia * ) satisfy the triangular inequality @xmath13 ( and cyclic permutations ) .",
    "the @xmath14-dimensional eigenspaces of @xmath15 are called the * principal axes of inertia*.    the vector @xmath16 is the angular momentum vector as seen in the euler top s frame , and is in general not constant .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 satisfies the so - called * euler equation * @xmath19 using @xmath20 , this is a ode for @xmath18 , which in an orthonormal basis @xmath21 of eigenvectors of @xmath15 is written @xmath22 the euler equations are integrable .",
    "an obvious first integral is @xmath23 ( which we assume to be nonzero ) , and a second first integral is the kinetic energy @xmath24 : @xmath25 thus the solutions with fixed norm of the angular momentum live on the intersections of the angular momentum sphere @xmath26 with the ellipsoids @xmath27 for different values of @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] ) . on the sphere @xmath29 for the symplectic structure given by @xmath30 times the standard surface area element . ]",
    "consider a right - handed orthonormal basis @xmath31 , fixed in the inertial frame , with @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath33 will be the unit normal vector to the angular momentum sphere at the point @xmath18 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 will be ( orthogonal ) unit vectors tangent to the sphere at the same point .",
    "we can ask ourselves what is the covariant derivative of @xmath36 as it moves along the sphere . since @xmath37 is constant",
    ", we have the euler - like equation @xmath38 as is well known @xcite , the covariant derivative is just the projection @xmath39 of @xmath40 on the tangent space to the sphere . thus and @xmath41 . ]",
    "@xmath42 in other words , @xmath36 rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath43 with respect to a parallel - transported frame on the sphere ( and the same must obviously be true for @xmath44 ) .",
    "this gives a nice picture of the motion : the fixed orthonormal basis @xmath31 is seen in the euler top s frame as the moving orthonormal basis @xmath45 .",
    "if we imagine this basis placed on the point @xmath18 of the angular momentum sphere ( which moves according to the euler equation ) , then @xmath46 is the outward unit normal vector and @xmath36 , @xmath44 rotate at a constant rate about @xmath46 .",
    "except for the six equilibrium points and four heteroclinic orbits , all orbits of @xmath18 on the angular momentum sphere are periodic ( cf .  figure  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "after one period , the angular momentum vector as seen in the euler top s frame has returned to the initial position . therefore the euler top has rotated by some angle @xmath47 around * p * with respect to its initial orientation .",
    "montgomery s formula gives this angle as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the period and @xmath50 is the area of the region bounded by the orbit on the angular momentum sphere ( with sign according to whether the orientation of the periodic orbit is induced by the standard orientation of this region ) . and",
    "@xmath51 , lead to the same angle @xmath52 . ]",
    "the first term , which is just the time integral of the component of @xmath53 along @xmath54 , is a dynamical phase .",
    "the second term , which can be thought of as a solid angle , is what is usually called a geometric phase .",
    "we can use our picture of the motion to give an elementary derivation of the montgomery formula .",
    "first , it is clear that @xmath47 exactly coincides with minus the angle by which @xmath36 has rotated with respect to its initial position after one orbit . since @xmath36 rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath43 with respect to a parallel - transported frame on the sphere , it will have rotated @xmath55 with respect to such a frame after one orbit ( dynamical phase ) . by elementary geometry of curved surfaces",
    "@xcite , upon returning to the initial point the parallel - transported frame will be rotated by an angle equal to the curvature of the sphere ( @xmath56 ) times the ( signed ) area @xmath50 of the region enclosed by its path ( geometric phase )",
    ". therefore we obtain @xmath57 which is montgomery s formula .",
    "in particular , the geometric phase is seen as a consequence of parallel transport on the angular momentum sphere .",
    "it is possible to give an approximate geometric interpretation of the geometric phase in the case of an orbit which starts close to one of the unstable equilibrium points on the angular momentum sphere ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] ) . for such orbits ,",
    "the motion of the euler top is roughly as follows : initially it is rotating with angular speed @xmath58 about @xmath54 ( that is , @xmath18 remains close to the equilibrium point ) ; then it quickly reorients itself by rotating @xmath59 about an axis perpendicular to @xmath54 ( @xmath18 rapidly moves to the other unstable equilibrium point along a heteroclinic ) ; in this upside - down orientation it continues to rotate about * p * with the same angular speed @xmath60 ( @xmath18 remains close to the other equilibrium point ) ; finally , it performs another reorientation by rotating @xmath59 about a ( different ) axis perpendicular to @xmath54 ( @xmath18 returns to the first equilibrium point along another heteroclinic ) . in other words , with respect to an auxiliary frame in uniform rotation about @xmath54 with angular speed @xmath61 , the motion of the euler top during one period consists basically of two @xmath62 rotations about certain axes perpendicular to @xmath54 .",
    "is an orthonormal basis fixed in the auxiliary frame , so that @xmath63 , then @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 . ]",
    "since the auxiliary frame rotates by @xmath66 during one period , the geometric phase must result from the composition of the two reorientations ( which in particular has to be a rotation about @xmath54 ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the heteroclinics are half great circles .",
    "they are contained in the planes @xmath67 . ] during the reorientations , the auxiliary frame rotates with respect to the euler top s frame about the axes perpendicular to these great circles , in the direction given by the euler flow . according to the geometric construction described in the appendix , the composition of these two rotations is a rotation about the middle moment of inertia axis by twice the angle between the two heteroclinics .",
    "but this is exactly @xmath68 , where @xmath50 is the ( signed ) area enclosed by the two heteroclinics",
    ". therefore the euler top rotates by @xmath69 about @xmath54 with respect to the auxiliary frame , giving the geometric phase .",
    "here we describe the geometric construction for the composition of rotations given in @xcite .",
    "this construction is dual to the more familiar rodrigues - hamilton construction , which uses triangles with vertices on the rotation axes @xcite .",
    "suppose that one wants to compose a rotation about some axis @xmath70 by an angle @xmath71 with a rotation about some other axis @xmath72 by an angle @xmath73",
    ". then on the unit sphere one draws the great circles perpendicular to @xmath70 and @xmath72 , oriented according to the direction of the rotation . from an intersection point @xmath74 of the two great circles one moves backwards along the first great circle by an angle @xmath75 ,",
    "thus reaching a point @xmath50 , and forwards along the second great circle by an angle @xmath76 , thus reaching a point @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "then the composition of the two rotations is a rotation about the axis perpendicular to the great circle through @xmath50 and @xmath77 , from @xmath50 to @xmath77 , by an angle @xmath78 equal to twice the angle between @xmath50 and @xmath77 ."
