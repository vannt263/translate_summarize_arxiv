    "we refer to the book of gustafson and rao @xcite .",
    "this paper arose from an attempt to gain a better understanding of mapping theorems for numerical ranges .",
    "in contrast with spectra , it is not true in general that @xmath15 for polynomials @xmath16 , nor is it true if we take convex hulls of both sides .",
    "however , some partial results do hold .",
    "perhaps the most famous of these is the power inequality : for all @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 this was conjectured by halmos and , after several partial results , was established by berger @xcite using dilation theory .",
    "an elementary proof was given by pearcy in @xcite .",

    "the assumption that @xmath4 is essential in the berger ",
    "stampfli theorem , as is shown by an example in @xcite . without this assumption ,",
    "the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "the best result in this setting is drury s teardrop theorem @xcite , which will be discussed in detail in  [ s : drury ] below . at the heart of the teardrop theorem",
    "is an operator inequality , which drury proved by citing a decomposition theorem of dritschel and woerdeman @xcite , and then performing some complicated calculations .",
    "it turns out that these difficulties can be circumvented by exploiting a refinement of the inequality .",
    "we establish this refinement in  [ s : nrineq ] and show how it can be used to simplify drury s argument in  [ s : drury ] . in  [ s : conclusion ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we present an elementary proof of the aforementioned theorem of berger and stampfli .",
    "here is the formal statement of the theorem .",
    "[ t : berger ] let @xmath1 be a complex hilbert space , let @xmath0 be a bounded linear operator on @xmath1 with @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be a function in the disk algebra such that @xmath4",
    ". then @xmath5 .",
    "we require two folklore lemmas about finite blaschke products .",
    "let us write @xmath20 for the open unit disk and @xmath21 for the unit circle .",
    "[ l : blaschke1 ] let @xmath22 be a finite blaschke product . then @xmath23 is real and strictly positive for all @xmath24 .",
    "we can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". then @xmath28 in particular , if @xmath24 , then @xmath29 which is real and strictly positive .",
    "[ l : blaschke2 ] let @xmath22 be a blaschke product of degree @xmath30 such that @xmath31 .",
    "then , given @xmath32 , there exist @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35    given @xmath32 , the roots of the equation @xmath36 lie on the unit circle , and by lemma  [ l : blaschke1 ] they are simple . call them @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 has simple poles at the @xmath39 . also , as @xmath31 , we have @xmath40 and so @xmath38 vanishes at @xmath41 . expanding it in partial fractions gives , for some choice of @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath43 are easily evaluated .",
    "indeed , from we have @xmath44 in particular @xmath45 by lemma  [ l : blaschke1 ] .",
    "suppose first that @xmath3 is a finite blaschke product @xmath22 .",
    "suppose also that the spectrum @xmath46 of @xmath0 lies within the open unit disk @xmath20 . by the spectral mapping theorem @xmath47 as well .",
    "let @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "given @xmath32 , let @xmath33 and @xmath34 as in lemma  [ l : blaschke2 ] .",
    "then we have @xmath50 since @xmath2 , we have @xmath51 , and as @xmath45 for all @xmath52 , it follows that @xmath53 as this holds for all @xmath32 and all @xmath54 of norm @xmath55 , it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "next we relax the assumption on @xmath3 , still assuming that @xmath57 .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath58 .",
    "then there exists a sequence of finite blaschke products @xmath59 that converges locally uniformly to @xmath3 in @xmath20 .",
    "( this is carathodory s theorem : a simple proof can be found in @xcite . ) moreover , as @xmath4 , we can also arrange that @xmath60 for all @xmath30 . by what we have proved , @xmath61 for all @xmath30 .",
    "also @xmath62 converges in norm to @xmath63 , because @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that @xmath64 , as required .",
    "finally we relax the assumption that @xmath57 . by what we have already proved , @xmath65 for all @xmath66 . interpreting @xmath63 as @xmath67",
    ", it follows that @xmath5 , _ provided _ that this limit exists . in particular this is true when @xmath3 is holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath68 . to prove the existence of the limit in the general case , we proceed as follows .",
    "given @xmath69 , the function @xmath70 is holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath68 and vanishes at  @xmath71 , so , by what we have already proved , @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 the right - hand side tends to zero as @xmath74 , so , by the usual cauchy - sequence argument , @xmath75 converges as @xmath76 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded operator on a hilbert space @xmath1 and let @xmath48 .",
    "the left - hand inequality in amounts to saying that @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in this section",
    "we establish the following local refinement .",

    "set @xmath82 and @xmath83 . by the triangle inequality",
    ", we then have @xmath84 now , by pythagoras theorem , @xmath85 and likewise for @xmath86 and @xmath22 .",
    "also @xmath86 and @xmath22 are self - adjoint operators and have numerical radius at most @xmath55 , so @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "further , the condition @xmath81 implies that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "hence @xmath91 combining all these inequalities , we obtain @xmath92 which , after simplification , yields .    from theorem  [ t : nrineq ]",
    "we derive the following operator inequality .",

    "the best result is a theorem due to drury @xcite .",
    "to state his result , we need to introduce some terminology .",
    "given @xmath104 , we define the ` teardrop region ' @xmath105 namely , the convex hull of the union of the closed unit disk and the closed disk of center @xmath106 and radius @xmath107 ( see figure  [ f : teardrop ] ) .    ) , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    drury s theorem can now be stated as follows .",
    "[ t : drury ] let @xmath0 be an operator on a hilbert space @xmath1 such that @xmath108 , and let @xmath102 be a function in the disk algebra .",
