    "we consider a collection of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) associated with a vector field  @xcite ( a continuous - time dynamical system ) .",
    "the general solution to these equations defines a _ flow_a mapping from the phase - space domain onto itself . for smooth vector fields ,",
    "the flow can be regarded as a smooth coordinate transformation ( a diffeomorphism ) from the set of initial conditions to the state of the system at some later time  @xcite .",
    "the coordinates describing the initial conditions are called the _ lagrangian coordinates _ , and those describing the state at a later time",
    "are called the _",
    "eulerian coordinates_.    generally , even a smooth vector field will lead to chaotic dynamics , with trajectories of nearby phase - space elements diverging rapidly from each other , at an average rate close to exponential for long times .",
    "the allowable rates are called the _ lyapunov exponent _ of the flow  @xcite , and are associated with _",
    "characteristic directions _ of stretching . for chaotic flows ,",
    "the transformation to lagrangian coordinates becomes exceedingly contorted , and in practise it can no longer be inverted , due the exponentially growing errors on the position of phase - space particles .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of chaos can actually be advantageous because it leads to a large separation of timescales along the different characteristic directions of the flow .",
    "this separation of scale was used by boozer  @xcite , tang and boozer  @xcite , and giona and adrover  @xcite to study fluid mixing and the dynamo problem .",
    "many equations of fluid dynamics are `` advective '' in nature , in that they describe the motion of a scalar or vector field as it is dragged by a flow , and possibly influenced by other effects such as diffusion and sources .",
    "examples are the scalar advection  diffusion equation  @xcite and the induction equation for a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "when expressed in lagrangian coordinates , the advective term drops out of these types of equations . for scalar and vector",
    "diffusion equations , one is left with a diffusion equation with anisotropic diffusivity .",
    "the anisotropic diffusivity arises because the jacobian of the transformation between lagrangian and eulerian coordinates is not orthogonal . in a chaotic flow",
    ", the complexity of the transformation leads to a singular jacobian , which is reflected in an exponentially - growing diffusivity that enhances mixing  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the singular jacobian is decomposed to isolate the dominant direction of enhanced diffusion , leading to an expression in terms of the finite - time lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions of stretching . to get a full solution of the advection ",
    "diffusion problem , the lagrangian derivatives of the finite - time lyapunov exponents and of the characteristic directions are needed .",
    "this is because the lagrangian coordinate frame is position - dependent , so when derivatives of vector fields are taken one must also differentiate the basis vectors themselves ( this is the same procedure as in covariant differentiation , or when fictitious forces appear after transforming to a rotating frame ) .",
    "thus the necessity of obtaining lagrangian derivatives of the vectors defining the coordinate frame . because lagrangian coordinates are",
    "also _ stretched _ with respect to eulerian coordinates , the derivatives of the characteristic rates of separations ( as characterised by the finite - time lyapunov exponents ) are also needed .",
    "the problem of finding the asymptotic form of lagrangian derivatives of the coordinate transformation induced by a flow has been addressed previously by dressler and farmer  @xcite and taylor  @xcite in a different context .",
    "they examined the asymptotic behaviour of the hessian , the quadratic form consisting of the second derivatives of the flow .",
    "the hessian is the term that follows the jacobian matrix in a taylor expansion of the coordinate transformation form lagrangian to eulerian coordinates .",
    "dressler and farmer call the growth rates of the hessian _ generalised _ or _ higher - order _ lyapunov exponents . their motivation lay in characterising the growth of nonlinear distortions of geometric quantities evolving under the influence of one - dimensional maps .",
    "the lyapunov exponents quantify the leading order stretching of an infinitesimal ellipse moving with the phase fluid , and the generalised exponents describe deviations from an elliptical shape .",
    "dressler and farmer provided numerical results only for the largest lyapunov exponent , because no numerical method exist to evolve the hessian in a numerically stable manner that is not susceptible to limited precision .",
    "we provide such a method here .    in the eulerian picture",
    ", the higher - order exponents also characterise the growth of extrinsic curvature of curves and surfaces embedded in a flow ( material lines and surfaces ) , and so can be connected to work describing the evolution of the curvature of material lines in turbulent flows that originated with batchelor  @xcite , and more recently was applied to chaotic flows  @xcite . our results  derived in the lagrangian frame  can easily be adapted to the eulerian picture , and provide a comprehensive view of second - order deformation processes in chaotic flows .",
    "the connexion between the eulerian and lagrangian pictures is made in an appendix .",
    "our approach is similar to refs .",
    "@xcite but is more general and applies to flows rather than maps : we aim to give estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of the lagrangian derivatives of finite - time lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions by appealing to arguments of `` genericity '' of the quantities involved , thus showing that the estimates will hold in essiantially all cases .",
    "these arguments are formal in nature , in the sense that they do not provide a mathematical proof of the results , since there will always exist flows that can be specifically chosen to violate any of the estimates .",
    "in particular , there could be flows with degenerate lyapunov exponents ( finite - time lyapunov exponents that are degenerate for short periods of time do not concern us ) .",
    "we expect that even for degenerate exponents the results of the paper are applicable in a limited form .",
    "in practise the asymptotic behaviour holds to great accuracy for all flows examined .",
    "this will be verified in the numerical section of the paper .    to obtain the estimates of asymptotic behaviour of derivatives",
    ", we perform a singular value decomposition ( ) of the tangent mapping of the flow , and differentiate the odes derived by greene and kim  @xcite directly .",
    "a careful analysis of the equations , with the assumption of a nondegenerate spectrum and a bounded attractor as in goldhirsch  @xcite , leads to our asymptotic forms .",
    "we find that the lagrangian derivatives along diverging directions of the finite - time lyapunov exponents grow exponentially at the characteristic rate of that direction .",
    "this is consistent with the intuitive notion that small displacements in those directions will be exponentially amplified , so one expects derivatives to grow as well . for contracting directions ,",
    "the opposite is true : the lagrangian derivatives converge exponentially to time - asymptotic values , but often do so at a slower rate than the characteristic rate .",
    "the lagrangian derivatives of the characteristic directions of stretching have a more complicated behaviour , and it is not always true that a derivative along an expanding direction will diverge  the intuitive picture fails .    the asymptotic behaviour derived using the  method can be used to recover so - called _ differential constraints _ on the finite - time lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions .",
    "such constraints were first derived in two dimensions by tang and boozer  @xcite and giona and adrover  @xcite and were later extended to three dimensions by thiffeault and boozer  @xcite .",
    "these earlier derivations provided limited results and were difficult to generalise to higher dimensions .",
    "in particular , the convergence rate of the constraints was not obtained , making it difficult to gauge their effect in approximations .",
    "the derivation given here overcomes these difficulties .    whilst the  method is transparent and useful for theoretical derivations and interpretation ,",
    "it is not well - suited for numerical purposes  @xcite : it possesses troubling singularities and involves a needlessly large number of equations to evolve .",
    "a better method is the decomposition  @xcite , also known as the _ continuous gram ",
    "schmidt orthonormalisation _ method because it is a time - continuous version of earlier methods that involved re - orthonormalising a set of vectors evolved using the tangent map of the flow  @xcite . as for the  method ,",
    "we adapt the  method to finding the lagrangian derivatives of the finite - time lyapunov exponents and of the characteristic eigenvectors .",
    "the  method can be used to verify the differential constraints mentioned above , since they depend on delicate cancellations that require the high accuracy afforded by the method herein in order to be convincingly established .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : basicth ]",
    "we introduce the basic framework and notation necessary to the subsequent development . the central object of study is the _ metric tensor _ transformed to lagrangian coordinates , and its diagonal form that contains all the information on the characteristic separations and directions .",
    "section  [ sec : directmethod ] describes the direct method of evolving the hessian , where its governing equations are obtained by a variation of the odes and integrated directly .",
    "this method is not very useful numerically because the exponential blowup of the elements of the hessian leads to issues of limited precision , but illustrates the basic principles and can be used to check the results of more complex methods , for short times .",
    "a more powerful method is introduced in section  [ sec : svdmethod ] , the decomposition method .",
    "this allows derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of the lagrangian derivatives .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is exploited in section  [ sec : symhesconstraints ] to investigate the properties of the hessian , and to give a new and powerful derivation of differential constraints in chaotic flows .    in section",
    "[ sec : qrmethod ] the  decomposition is used to develop a suitable numerical method for evolving the various lagrangian derivatives .",
    "the numerical method is then used to verify to high precision the geometrical constraints derived in section  [ sec : symhesconstraints ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] consists of a brief summary of the main results of this paper and of possible future work , as well as a discussion of possible applications .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the concepts and notation we shall use .",
    "we consider the  @xmath0-dimensional dynamical system @xmath1 where the overdot indicates a time derivative , and  @xmath2 is a smooth function of  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 .",
    "the solution to  ( [ eq : dynsys ] ) is a function  @xmath5 , with initial condition  @xmath6",
    ". we can thus regard  @xmath5 as a coordinate transformation from the set of initial conditions  @xmath7 to the state at time  @xmath4 ; we write this transformation explicitly as  @xmath8 . on the initial time  @xmath9 . ] following standard terminology , we call  @xmath3 the eulerian coordinates and  @xmath7 the lagrangian coordinates",
    ".    the time - evolution of the jacobian matrix   is given by @xmath10 where  @xmath11 ; the initial conditions are  , since the coordinates  @xmath3 and  @xmath7 initially coincide .",
    "the nonsingular jacobian matrix tells us how to transform vectors in  @xmath7 coordinates to vectors in  @xmath3 coordinates ( @xmath12 is the tangent mapping to the transformation  @xmath8 ) .",
    "now construct the matrix @xmath13 called the _",
    "metric tensor in lagrangian coordinates _ or _",
    "cauchy  green strain tensor _",
    "@xcite ; it is symmetric and positive - definite , so it can be diagonalized with real positive eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors and rewritten as @xmath14 with  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 respectively the  @xmath17th eigenvector of  @xmath18 and corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "we refer to the  @xmath19 as the _ coefficients of expansion _ , because they represent the relative deformation of the principal axes of an infinitesimal ellipsoid carried by the flow .",
    "the coefficients of expansion can be used to define the finite - time lyapunov exponents , @xmath20 the finite - time lyapunov exponents ,  @xmath21 describe the instantaneous average rate of exponential separation of neighbouring trajectories .",
    "the multiplicative ergodic theorem of oseledec  @xcite implies that the infinite - time limit  @xmath22 of  @xmath21 exists and is independent of the initial condition  @xmath7 in a given ergodic domain , for almost all initial conditions . the infinite - time limit  @xmath23 of the characteristic eigenvectors",
    "@xmath15 also exists but depends on the initial condition .",
    "the lyapunov exponents converge very slowly , whereas for nondegenerate exponents the characteristic eigenvectors converge exponentially fast  @xcite .",
    "the slow convergence of the lyapunov exponents indicates that the instantaneous separation rate of neighbouring trajectories is not at all exponential on a typical attractor ; only in the infinite - time limit do the trajectories show a mean exponential rate of separation .",
    "the instantaneous deviations from this exponential rate are very large .",
    "however , even though it may not be growing exponentially , an eigenvalue  @xmath19 associated with a positive lyapunov exponent becomes very large after a relatively short time , and conversely an eigenvalue associated with a negative lyapunov exponent becomes very small .",
    "it is thus an abuse of language , but a convenient one we shall use , to refer to the  @xmath19 s as growing or shrinking exponentially .    in this paper we shall assume that the eigenvalues  @xmath19 are nondegenerate and ordered such that  .",
    "after allowing some time for chaotic behaviour to set in , we have that   for  @xmath24 .",
    "we shall make use of this ordering often in the subsequent development .",
    "when the vector field  @xmath25 is a known analytic function , explicit evolution equations for the spatial derivatives of the  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 can be derived , as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the method involves expressing the derivatives of  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 in terms of derivatives of the metric tensor  @xmath28 .",
    "this is done by taking the lagrangian derivative of the diagonal form  ( [ eq : metricdiag ] ) of  @xmath28  and dotting the resulting expression with the eigenvectors  @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain @xmath29 the derivatives of the metric are obtained from the hessian  @xmath30 of the coordinate transformation via the relation @xmath31 obtained by differentiating the non - diagonal form  ( [ eq : metricdef ] ) of  @xmath28 .",
    "the hessian is symmetric in its lower indices , and it is computed by solving the evolution equation @xmath32 where  . for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to  ( [ eq : tangent2ode ] ) , it is necessary that  @xmath33 be lipschitz , but it is sufficient that  @xmath2 be at least thrice - differentiable .",
    "is obtained by differentiating  ( [ eq : tangentode ] ) , and the initial condition is  @xmath34 .",
    "the time derivatives ( the overdots ) are taken at constant  @xmath7 , so they can be commuted with lagrangian derivatives .",
    "the linear part of  ( [ eq : tangent2ode ] ) is the same as for  ( [ eq : tangentode ] ) , but now there is a nonlinear coupling term to  @xmath35 .",
    "since for a chaotic flow the matrix  @xmath35 has at least one exponentially growing eigenvalue , the elements of the hessian  @xmath36 ctypically grow faster than  @xmath35 , owing to the nonlinear coupling .",
    "numerically , the system  ( [ eq : tangent2ode ] ) is thus unstable in an essential way , and we can expect the integration to give meaningless results ( except along the dominant stretching direction ) after the elements of  @xmath36 become too large .",
    "nevertheless , if one is not interested in long - time behaviour the direct method can yield satisfactory results .",
    "it is not suitable for a detailed , accurate , long - time solution of the lagrangian derivatives .",
    "we develop such methods in sections  [ sec : svdmethod ] and  [ sec : qrmethod ] .",
    "any matrix , and in particular the jacobian matrix  @xmath35 , can be decomposed into the product @xmath37 where  @xmath38 and  @xmath39 are orthogonal matrices and  @xmath40 is diagonal .",
    "the superscript  @xmath41 denotes a matrix transpose .",
    "this decomposition is called the _ singular value decomposition _ ( ) , and is unique up to permutations of rows and columns . the diagonal elements  @xmath19 of  @xmath40",
    "are called the singular values .",
    "requiring that the singular values be ordered decreasing in size makes the decomposition unique ( for nondegenerate eigenvalues ) . as can be seen by substitution of  ( [ eq : svddecomp ] ) into  ( [ eq : metricdef ] )",
    ", the columns of  @xmath39 are eigenvectors of  @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with eigenvalues given by the diagonal elements of  @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the advantage of the  is that it separates neatly the parts of  @xmath35 that are growing or shrinking exponentially in size ( as determined by the coefficients of expansion  @xmath19 ) .",
    "the  has the following interpretation : if we consider an infinitesimally small `` ball '' of initial condition obeying  ( [ eq : dynsys ] ) , it will deform into an ellipsoid under the action of the flow",
    ". the  @xmath19 give the relative stretching of each principal axis of the ellipsoid , the orthogonal matrix  @xmath39 gives the principal axes of stretching in lagrangian coordinate space , and the orthogonal matrix  @xmath38 gives the absolute orientation of the ellipse in eulerian space .",
    "constructing the metric tensor as in  ( [ eq : metricdef ] ) eliminates the eulerian orientation , retaining the essential features of the stretching .",
    "greene and kim  @xcite derived the equations satisfied by  @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and  @xmath40 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 numerically , the  method has limitations : the number of quantities to evolve is large , and when  @xmath48 the denominators become singular ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of these issues ) . however , conceptually the method is very straightforward and transparent , and it gives explicit equations for all the quantities we are interested in , as opposed to the  method ( section  [ sec : qrmethod ] ) which needs to be corrected to yield the true value of the  @xmath19 .    for large time ,",
    "when  @xmath49 ,  @xmath50 , we can approximate  ( [ eq : svduode ] ) and  ( [ eq : svdvode ] ) by @xmath51 where we have used @xmath52 the matrix  @xmath53 is symmetric , and defined such that ( for nondegenerate  @xmath54 ) all of its elements are decaying exponentially . because of the ordering of the  @xmath19 , the diagonal element  @xmath55 represents the element on the  @xmath56th row or column that decays the slowest , that is ,  @xmath57 .",
    "if we assume that the evolution of the system takes place on some bounded domain , then we know that  @xmath58 , and hence  @xmath59 and  @xmath60 , remains bounded ( we also assume that the vector field  @xmath2 is smooth ) .",
    "thus , the right - hand side of  @xmath61 in  ( [ eq : svduvodeapprox ] ) goes to zero exponentially , and we can solve the equation perturbatively for large time , @xmath62 for some constant  @xmath63 , which can only be determined by solving the unapproximated equation  ( [ eq : svdvode ] ) . we conclude that for large  @xmath4 the matrix  @xmath39 has the form  @xcite @xmath64 since  @xmath65 and  @xmath66 , the characteristic eigenvectors converge exponentially to their time - asymptotic value , @xmath67 .",
    "the elements of the matrix  @xmath38 do _ not _ in general converge .",
    "the lyapunov exponents have a very slow ( logarithmic ) convergence which does not concern us here , as we are considering timescales of fast ( roughly exponential ) convergence .",

    ".    in [ apx : svdlagrasym ] , the asymptotic behaviour of the derivatives is obtained from the equations of motion  ( [ eq : vgrnuode])([eq : vgrvode ] ) .",
    "we now summarise the main results of that section : for  @xmath79 , by which we mean that the dynamical system has evolved long enough for the quantities  @xmath26 to have reached a regime of quasi - exponential behaviour , we have that the lagrangian derivatives defined by  ( [ eq : vgrunuvdef ] ) evolve asymptotically as @xmath80 recall that in all these cases the first index ,  @xmath78 , denotes the characteristic eigendirection  @xmath81 along which the lagrangian derivative is evaluated . for a given  @xmath78 with  , corresponding to an expanding direction of the flow , both  @xmath74 and  @xmath73 grow exponentially with time ( the constant  @xmath82 is then irrelevant ) .",
    "thus , lagrangian derivatives of  @xmath83 along an expanding direction  @xmath78 become more singular with time , to a degree commensurate with the separation of neighbouring initial conditions along that direction , as given by  @xmath84 .",
    "conversely , for  @xmath78 with  , corresponding to a contracting direction of the flow , both  @xmath74 and  @xmath73 decrease exponentially with time ,  @xmath74 converging toward zero and  @xmath73 converging to a constant ,  @xmath82 . the convergence rate of both these quantities , however , is not necessarily equal to  @xmath84 but may be slower ( though still converging ) , as denoted by the  @xmath85 in  ( [ eq : vgruasym ] ) and  ( [ eq : vgrnuasym ] )",
    ". this slower convergence rate of  @xmath86 has two sources : ( i ) from  ( [ eq : vasym ] ) , the  @xmath87 in the definition  ( [ eq : vgrunuvdef ] ) of  @xmath73 converges at a rate  @xmath88 ; ( ii ) the  @xmath89 term in  ( [ eq : vgrnuode ] ) limits the convergence to  @xmath90 .",
    "the interpretation of the long - time behaviour of lagrangian derivatives of  @xmath39 , the characteristic eigenvectors , is less generic . for a contracting direction  @xmath78",
    ", the derivatives  @xmath75 converge to the constant value  @xmath91 at a rate of  @xmath92 .",
    "this convergence rate is dominated by the convergence of the individual  @xmath39 s in  ( [ eq : vgrunuvdef ] ) , as given by  ( [ eq : vasym ] ) . for an expanding direction  @xmath78 ,",
    "the specific behaviour of  @xmath75 depends on the relative magnitudes of the coefficients of expansion  @xmath54 .",
    "however , for a non - contracting direction  @xmath78 it is always true that @xmath93 so the gradients of  @xmath94 along expanding directions grow much more slowly that those of  @xmath95 .",
    "we close this section by considering the asymptotic behaviour of the lagrangian derivative of the determinant ,  @xmath96 , of the metric tensor  @xmath42 . from  ( [ eq : metricdiag ] ) , @xmath97 so that the lagrangian derivative of the determinant along  @xmath87 is @xmath98 an equation of motion for  @xmath99 is obtained by summing  ( [ eq : vgrnuode ] ) over  @xmath100 , yielding @xmath101 where the  @xmath89 term has dropped out .",

    "although we are not using the  method to obtain numerical results , the considerations of this section also apply to the  method of section  [ sec : qrmethod ] .",
    "the relations  ( [ eq : hessymrel1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : hessymrel2 ] ) can then be used as a diagnostic tool to monitor the numerical results .      rather than solving for the  @xmath118 , if the flow is chaotic the relations  ( [ eq : hessymrel1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : hessymrel2 ] ) can be put to good use in another manner .",
    "the lagrangian derivatives of  @xmath38 , as contained in  @xmath89 , are not quantities of great interest to us .",
    "they describe the sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the absolute orientation of phase - fluid elements in eulerian space .",
    "this information is not necessary for solving problems in lagrangian coordinates , and is too sensitive to initial conditions to be of use anyhow .",

    "the matrix  @xmath61 , given in  ( [ eq : svduvodeapprox ] ) , becomes exponentially small with time .",

    "@xmath221 , a perturbative expansion solution to an equation of the form @xmath222 is valid only for  @xmath223 .",
    "so for large time , at fixed  @xmath221 , the solution must eventually become invalid .",
    "however , in our case the parameter  @xmath221 , corresponding to  @xmath61 , actually decreases exponentially in time ( for nondegenerate eigenvalues  @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus ,  @xmath223 even for large  @xmath4 , and the expansion remains valid .",
    "in this appendix we prove that  ( [ eq : qreigensystem ] ) gives the asymptotically correct value of the eigenvectors  @xmath27 and coefficients of expansion  @xmath26 ( the square root of the eigenvalues of  @xmath42 ) .",

    "the matrix  @xmath150 is nonsingular , so we can invert  ( [ eq : gsorthoqr ] ) and write  @xmath225 .    using the definition of the metric ,  @xmath226 , and the  decomposition  ( [ eq : qrdecomp ] )",
    ", we have @xmath227 if  @xmath228 were diagonal , then we would be done ; the matrix  @xmath228 is not diagonal , but we show that it can be made so by exponentially small corrections of the  @xmath153 .",
    "writing out  @xmath228 explicitly , we find @xmath229 the  @xmath230 is the lower bound of the sum owing to the lower - triangular form of  @xmath150 . looking at  ( [ eq : rqrode ] ) , it is clear the the  @xmath145 converge to constant values , because for  @xmath231 ,  @xmath232 exponentially in time .",
    "hence , by their definition ,  @xmath153 and  @xmath150 also converge to constant values in time .",
    "all of the exponential behaviour is thus embodied in  @xmath233 .",
    "keeping only the dominant term , we have @xmath234 note that since  @xmath150 is triangular we have  @xmath235 . for the first column of",
    "@xmath153 , it follows that @xmath236 showing that the first column of  @xmath153 is an eigenvector of  @xmath42 with eigenvalue  @xmath237 .",

    "assume that the columns  @xmath240 , @xmath241 , are eigenvectors of  @xmath42 with eigenvalue  @xmath242 .",
    "we show by induction that with the ( small ) correction  ( [ eq : wcorr ] ) the column  @xmath243 is an eigenvector of  @xmath42 with eigenvalue  @xmath244 .    using   and  ( [ eq : wcorr ] ) ,",
    "the corrected matrix element  @xmath245 , with  @xmath241 , is @xmath246 we use the induction hypothesis that  @xmath247 when both  @xmath100 and  @xmath17 are less than  @xmath56 , and find @xmath248 to exponential accuracy .",

    "thus , to exponential accuracy  @xmath243 is indeed an eigenvector of  @xmath42 with eigenvalue  @xmath251 .    to complete the proof , we need to show that the columns  @xmath252 , with  @xmath253 , are not modified by the correction  ( [ eq : wcorr ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath254 which to leading order is @xmath255 showing that the correction can be neglected .",
    "we have thus proved by induction that the correction  ( [ eq : wcorr ] ) to  @xmath153 makes  @xmath228 diagonal to leading order , leaving its diagonal elements unaffected",

    "we conclude that the eigenvectors of  @xmath42 and corresponding coefficients of expansion are @xmath256 to exponential accuracy with time .",
    "the relative error on  @xmath27 and  @xmath155 is of order  @xmath156 , as can be seen from the leading - order correction in  ( [ eq : wcorr ] ) and  ( [ eq : ddcorr ] ) .",

    "conversely , one can regard eulerian derivatives as the effect of an infinitesimal change in the _ final _ condition of a trajectory , with the integration being performed backwards in time .",
    "this is the viewpoint taken in studies of the alignment of material lines with the eulerian unstable manifold of a system , a phenomenon referred to as _ asymptotic directionality _  @xcite .    in our framework , the eulerian characteristic directions are computed from the metric @xmath257 or  @xmath258 .",
    "we have explicitly written the dependence on initial time because we are now interested in evolving @xmath9 towards  @xmath259 , whilst holding the eulerian coordinates  @xmath4 and  @xmath3 fixed .",
    "the dynamical system  ( [ eq : dynsys ] ) and the  equations  ( [ eq : svdnugrode])([eq : svdvode ] ) are also evolved backwards in time : the method yields  @xmath260 , so that we must take the inverse of the resulting  @xmath19 to obtain the `` forward - time '' coefficients of expansion .",
    "we assume the forward - time coefficients have then been reordered in the usual decreasing manner , so that  @xmath261 is still the fastest - growing coefficient ( the columns of  @xmath38 and  @xmath39 are also reordered ) .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the eulerian derivatives will thus be the inverse of their lagrangian counterpart .",
    "the columns of  @xmath39 now contain vectors associated with the eulerian frame .",
