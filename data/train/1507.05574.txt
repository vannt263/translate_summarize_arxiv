    "this model spectrum assumes a central source of blackbody temperature 4200 k , and indicates that the temperature of dust detected by _",

    "note that this model does not include carbon or other featureless dust grains that contribute to the continuum emission .",
    "the modeling indicates that the silicate dust in the inner disk is primarily ( 86% by mass ) composed of large ( @xmath05 @xmath4 m radius ) amorphous pyroxene and olivine grains at both warm and cool temperatures .",
    "there are also clear signatures of warm and cool forsterite and silica in crystalline form ; these grain types constitute the other 14% of the total silicate dust composition , according to the model fitting .",
    "the modeling indicates that contributions to the mid - ir emission from small grains below the rayleigh limit ( 2@xmath57 1 , where @xmath58 is the radius of the dust grain ) or other non - crystalline components are negligible .",
    "the foregoing results allow us to compare the composition of the dust in the circumbinary disk orbiting v4046 sgr with other protoplanetary disks and other transitional disk objects of similar age , such as tw hya and hen 3 - 600 ( twa 3 ) .",

    "* ) , yet the disk around v4046 sgr has a comparatively high crystallinity fraction and is otherwise dominated by large silicate grains .",

    "however , the transitional and pre - transitional sources in the @xcite sample all have negligible crystallinity fractions .",
    "the fraction of large , cool dust grains inferred for the v4046 sgr disk is also very high larger than 93% of the sources in taurus / auriga .",
    "this suggests that grain growth has occurred in the disk , which is consistent with the advanced age of the system .",
    "@xcite also find that disks orbiting multiple star systems tend to have larger warm large grain fractions than single star systems .",
    "this may be due to dynamical interactions between the stars and the disk that trigger grain growth in the inner disk and/or to photoevaporation of small grains . since v4046 sgr is a multiple star system with a large mass fraction of cool large grains rather than warm large grains , it is possible that a planetary companion in the inner disk is clearing away smaller particles and enhancing the large grain population at larger ( cooler ) radii .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been suggested as to how crystalline silicates form in protoplanetary disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the leading mechanisms involves amorphous silicates being thermally annealed into crystalline silicates as a result of heating induced by shock fronts within the disk .",
    "these shock fronts can result from star - disk interactions , if the disk is massive enough , or from local gravitational instabilities associated with planet formation .",
    "@xcite present direct - imaging evidence for dust segregation by size , as well as dust ring structure , in the inner @xmath040 au of the disk around v4046 sgr , and suggest that planet formation has occurred or is ongoing in the disk . this planet formation activity , if present , would help explain the combination of moderate crystallinity and large dust grains .",
    "grain growth and planet formation may have occurred recently in the disk , thus creating a larger than typical crystallinity fraction for a disk with an inner gap and advanced age .",
    "crystalline silicates at or interior to these planet formation zones would likely accrete onto either the central binary star or protoplanet(s ) .",
    "since the _ spitzer _ spectra are tracing the inner few au of the disk ( see section 4.8 ) we may be seeing the crystalline silicates in the innermost portion of the disk that have not yet accreted onto the central stars .",
    "another possible scenario for the presence of crystalline silicates in the disk , and the varying crystallinity fraction amongst young stars , is thermal annealing of surface grains due to intense pre - ms stellar outbursts @xcite .",
    "such outbursts are typically associated with episodes of dramatically enhanced pre - ms accretion rate , however , and the ( highly evolved , low - accretion - rate ) v4046 sgr system is unlikely to have experienced such an episode .",
    "furthermore , our modeling shows that the warm dust is currently at a temperature of @xmath0350 k , far below the @xmath0700 k required to thermally anneal dust , so if crystalline silicates formed via irradiation during an accretion - related outburst , they have since cooled and migrated outward in the disk .",
    "modeling of the entire v4046 sgr disk was conducted by @xcite based on their sma co data , as well as on _ spitzer _ irs spectra and archival photometric data of v4046 sgr .",
    "using a 3d radiative transfer code , they developed a three - component model that includes an inner  gap \" filled with @xmath4m - sized dust grains out to @xmath0 30 au , a ring of cm / mm - sized dust grains from @xmath030 - 45 au , and an extended halo of co and small grain emission .",
    "their resulting model well reproduces the mid- to far - ir photometry and 1.3 mm @xmath45co and continuum interferometric observations of v4046 sgr .",
    "the same model fits our _ herschel _ data remarkably well , due to their inclusion of @xmath4m - sized grains out to @xmath0 30 au .",
    "however , the @xcite model did not reproduce the detailed sed structure at _ spitzer _ irs wavelengths .",
    "the mismatch between the model and data in this wavelength range was due to the presence of a complex ( crystalline plus amorphous ) silicate grain mixture in the inner disk ( see section 4.7 ) that is not accounted for by the three - component model .    in figure [ new_fit ] , we replace the shorter - wavelength ( 7.7 - 33 @xmath4 m ) portion of the @xcite model with our silicate model .",
    "this revised model , which better reproduces the _ spitzer _ spectra , merges seamlessly with the rosenfeld model at @xmath033 @xmath4 m . using the @xcite model , we can estimate the characteristic disk radii probed by our silicate model , assuming that our newly calculated dust composition and resulting dust opacities do not significantly alter the disk temperature in their models .",
    "figure [ temp_rad ] shows disk temperature versus radius for both large ( mm - sized ) and small ( micron - sized ) grains based on the @xcite model .",
    "our silicate dust modeling shows dust at 340 k and 116 k , which correspond to a radius of 0.3 au and 1.3 au , respectively , for small ( @xmath4m - sized ) grains .",
    "we conclude that the _ spitzer _ data likely probe the dust grain populations of the inner disk within these approximate radii .",
    "we have presented an analysis of _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ spectra of the disk around v4046 sgr that elucidates the gas and dust constituents within the disk .",
    "we confirm the measurement of strong [ ne  ii ] at 12.8 @xmath4 m previously reported by @xcite and report an upper limit for [ ne  iii ] emission .",
    "the [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] ratio is consistent with other ctts systems that are x - ray bright and lack jets .",
    "we also detect emission from pure rotational h@xmath1 0 - 0 s(1 ) ( j=3@xmath131 ) at 17 @xmath4 m that likely originates in the surface layers of the disk where the temperature is warmer than the midplane at a given radius due to stellar uv / x - ray irradiation .",
    "the x - ray / uv radiation coming from the central binary is likely photodissociating co , h@xmath1o , and oh , resulting in emission from [ o  i ] and oh . we detect emission from [ o  i ] at 63 @xmath4 m , but do not detect [ c  i ] or [ c  ii ] in the mid- to far - infrared .",
    "thus , the excess c atoms may be forming hcn and other hydrocarbons throughout the disk , and/or the [ o  i ] is arising from photodissociated oh in the disk .",
    "the strength of the [ o  i ] emission is lower than that for star - disk systems of similar spectral type and accretion properties surrounded by continuous disks , as was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "v4046 sgr exhibits oh @xmath43 emission at 84.4 , 84.6 , and 119 @xmath4 m , and possible weak h@xmath1o emission features in the mid- to far - infrared .",
    "this suggests that h@xmath1o and collisionally excited oh molecules reside in the the outer layers of the v4046 sgr disk .",
    "modeling of the _ spitzer _ spectra reveal that the mid - ir emitting region of the disk consists primarily of large ( @xmath59 m ) silicate dust particles ( 86% by mass ) , with crystalline forsterite and silica particles making up the other 14% of the mass .",
    "overall , the presence of large grains suggests that grain growth may be occurring in the inner @xmath030 au gap around v4046 sgr and the abundance of cool dust suggests that dust may be settling towards the midplane where temperatures are lower at a given radius .",
    "the moderate crystallinity fraction is similar to that of less evolved protoplanetary disks in the taurus / auriga star forming region @xcite , and may result from heating and thermal annealing of micron - sized dust that is associated with planet formation activity in the inner disk @xcite . combining our silicate dust model with the mid - ir to sub - mm three - component model of @xcite",
    ", we find that the dust emission seen in the spitzer spectrum likely originates from regions of the disk interior to 1.3 au .",
