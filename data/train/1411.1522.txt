    "even if the foundations of the theory of quantum mechanics are very well settled , there are still open questions about its classical limit and the interaction between classical and quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , there are hybrid theories which take into account classical as well as quantum degrees of freedom ( see for instance @xcite ) , but will not be considered here . concerning the classical limit of quantum mechanics , in ref .",
    "@xcite the idea that such a limit should be an ensemble of classical orbits was proposed .",
    "this classical ensemble should be described by a classical probability distribution on phase space and , thus , its evolution would be given by the liouville equation .",
    "it is not possible to compare directly classical and quantum probability distributions since they are defined on different spaces .",
    "therefore , a very convenient way to perform such a comparison is by decomposing both probability distributions in terms of its infinite set of moments .",
    "these moments are the observable quantities and one could directly relate ( and experimentally measure ) their classical and quantum values .",
    "the formalism to analyze the evolution of these moments was first developed in @xcite for the hamiltonian of a particle on a potential .",
    "a formalism similar to this one , but with a different ordering of the basic variables , was presented in @xcite on a canonical framework and for generic hamiltonians .",
    "let us comment that this latter formalism has found several applications in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , isotropic models with a cosmological constant have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "bounce scenarios have also been studied within the framework of loop quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in addition , the problem of time has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "remarkably this framework is also useful when the dynamics is generated by a hamiltonian constraint , as opposed to a hamiltonian function @xcite .",
    "recently the classical counterpart of the formalism developed in @xcite was presented @xcite . in this reference",
    "it was argued that the quantum effects have two different origins . on the one hand ,",
    "_ distributional _ effects are due to the fact that , because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , one needs to consider an extensive ( as opposed to a dirac delta ) distribution with nonvanishing moments .",
    "these effects are also present in the evolution of a classical ensemble and , for instance , they generically prevent the centroid of the distribution ( the expectation value of the position and momentum ) from following a classical trajectory on the phase space . on the other hand , _ noncommutativity _ or _ purely quantum _ effects appear as explicit @xmath0 terms in the quantum equations of motion and have no classical counterpart . in the present paper",
    ", this formalism for the evolution of classical and quantum probability distributions will be applied to the case of a particle moving on a potential with the particular aim of measuring the relative relevance of each of the mentioned effects .",
    "the analysis will be made in two parts .",
    "on the one hand , the systems with a harmonic hamiltonian will be considered , that is , those that are at most quadratic on the basic variables .",
    "this includes the system of a particle under a uniform force ( which trivially includes also the free particle case ) , the harmonic oscillator , and the inverse harmonic oscillator .",
    "one of the properties of this kind of hamiltonians is that there is no purely quantum effect and , thus , they generate the same dynamics in the quantum and in the classical ( distributional ) cases . in addition",
    ", the equations of motion generated by this harmonic hamiltonians are much simpler than in the general case , so it will be possible to obtain analytically the explicit form of their moments corresponding to stationary as well as to dynamical states .",
    "on the other hand , due to the complexity of the anharmonic case , a concrete particular example must be analyzed . in our case , between the large set of anharmonic systems",
    ", we have chosen the pure quartic potential in order to study both its stationary and dynamical states with this formalism . as simple as it might seem ,",
    "the quartic harmonic oscillator can not be solved analytically and one usually resorts either to numerical or analytical methods of approximation . nonetheless , from a perturbative perspective the model of the quartic",
    "oscillator corresponds to a singular perturbation problem due to the fact that in the limit of a vanishing coupling constant , several physical quantities diverge @xcite . hence ,",
    "even if it has been studied during decades and , for instance , its energy eigenvalues are well known from numerical computations @xcite , this model is still considered of interest in different context and new approximation techniques are being developed to treat it , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_formalism ] a summary of the formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is given .",

    ". finally , sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] summarizes the main results and details the conclusions of the paper .",
    "given a quantum system with one degree of freedom described by the basic conjugate variables @xmath1 , it is possible to define the quantum moments as follows : @xmath2 in this equation @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been defined , and weyl ( totally symmetric ) ordering has been chosen .",
    "the sum between the two indices of a given moment , @xmath5 , will be referred as its order .",
    "the evolution equations for these moments are given by the following effective hamiltonian , which is defined as the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator @xmath6 , and it is taylor expanded around the position of its centroid @xmath7 : @xmath8 the hamiltonian @xmath9 is the function obtained by replacing in the hamiltonian operator @xmath10 every operator by its expectation value .",
    "the equations of motion for the expectation values ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and for the infinite set of moments @xmath13 are directly obtained by computing the poisson brackets between the different variables with the hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) . in particular , it is easy to show that poisson brackets between expectation values and moments vanish .",
    "furthermore , a closed formula is known for the poisson bracket between any two moments @xcite . in this way",
    "an infinite system of ordinary differential equations is obtained , which is completely equivalent to the schrdinger flow of states . in the general case , as will be shown below , in order to perform the resolution of this system , it is necessary to introduce a cutoff @xmath14 and drop all moments of an order higher than @xmath14 .",
    "the classical counterpart of this formalism is obtained by assuming a classical ensemble described by a probability distribution function @xmath15 on a phase space coordinatized by @xmath16 . as it is well known , the evolution equation of such a distribution is given by the liouville equation .",
    "following the same procedure as in the quantum case , making use of the probability distribution @xmath15 , one can define a classical expectation value operation on the phase space : @xmath17 where the integration extends to the whole domain of the probability distribution . with this operation at hand ,",
    "the classical moments can be defined as @xmath18 @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the position of the centroid of the distribution , that is , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note that in this classical case , everything commutes and , thus , the ordering in the definition of the moments is indifferent . as in the quantum case , the effective hamiltonian that encodes the dynamical information of these variables",
    "is constructed by computing the expectation value of the hamiltonian and expanding it around the position of the centroid . in this way , one obtains the classical effective hamiltonian : @xmath21 the equations of motion for the classical moments and expectation values @xmath7 are then obtained by computing their poisson brackets with this hamiltonian .",
    "the infinite system of equations of motion that is obtained by this procedure is then completely equivalent to the evolution given by the liouville equation .",
    "the evolution equations obeyed by the classical moments are the same as the ones fulfilled by their quantum counterparts with the particularization @xmath22 .",
    "these @xmath0 factors only appear when computing the poisson brackets between two moments due to the noncommutativity of the basic operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in this formalism",
    "it is very clear that the classical limit , understood as @xmath25 , of a quantum theory is not a unique trajectory on the phase space , but an ensemble of classical trajectories described by a probability distribution @xmath26 or its corresponding moments @xmath27 . in this way ,",
    "the quantum effects have two different origins . on the one hand ,",
    "_ distributional _ effects are due to the fact that moments can not be vanishing ( due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation ) and generically the centroid of a distribution @xmath7 does not follow a classical _ point _ trajectory on phase space .",
    "( the classical orbit obtained with an initial dirac delta distribution , for which all moments vanish , will be referred as classical point trajectory . )",
    "these distributional effects are also present in a classical setting . on the other hand , there are _ noncommutativity _ or _ purely quantum _ effects , which appear as explicit @xmath0 factors in the quantum equations of motion .",
    "these latter effects are due to the noncommutativity of the basic operators and have no classical counterpart .",
    "the evolution of the classical and quantum moments differ for a generic hamiltonian due to the commented @xmath0 terms .",
    "nevertheless the harmonic hamiltonians , defined as those that are at most quadratic in the basic variables , have very special properties and , in particular , they generate exactly the same evolution in the classical and quantum frameworks . in this paper",
    "the hamiltonian of a particle on a potential will be studied and , due to these special properties of the harmonic hamiltonians , the analysis will be separated between the harmonic and the anharmonic case .",
    "all possible harmonic systems will be studied but , regarding the anharmonic sector , which is much more involved , only a particular example will be worked out : the pure quartic oscillator .",
    "once the equations of motion are obtained , the only information left to obtain a dynamical state are the initial conditions .",
    "nonetheless , the stationary states play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics . in this setting , moments corresponding to a stationary state can be obtained as fixed points of the dynamical system under consideration ; that is , by dropping all time derivatives on the equations of motion for @xmath28 and solving the remaining algebraic system .",
    "this system of algebraic equations , as will be made explicit below , is sometimes incomplete and thus it is not possible to fix the values of all variables @xmath28 of a stationary state by this method .",
    "nonetheless , as shown in @xcite , another condition for the stationary states can be derived as a recursive relation between moments of the form @xmath29 , by making use of the fact that these states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator ( @xmath30 ) . for the kind of hamiltonians that will be treated in this paper ,",
    "corresponding to mechanical systems of a particle on a potential @xmath31 with potentials of the form @xmath32 and vanishing expectation value @xmath11 in its stationary state , this recursive relation can be written in the following way ( see @xcite for more details ) : @xmath33 in consequence , whenever moments up to order @xmath34 are known , the higher - order fluctuations of the position can be obtained directly .",
    "classical stationary moments obey this very same equation dropping the last term .    in order to finalize the summary of previous works ,",
    "let us comment that the moments corresponding to a valid probability distribution ( wave function ) are not free and obey several inequalities .",
    "the most simple examples are the non - negativity of moments with two even indices , @xmath35 and the heisenberg uncertainty principle , @xmath36 as always , inequalities for classical moments are obtained from the ones of the quantum moments by taking @xmath22 . in ref .",
    "@xcite several inequalities for high - order moments were obtained .",
    "these inequalities will be used below to constrain the values of certain moments of stationary states as well as to monitor the validity of the numerical resolution of dynamical states .",
    "for definiteness , in order to check the interpretation and applicability of the formalism for classical and quantum moments summarized in previous section , here the hamiltonian for a particle moving on a potential will be assumed , @xmath37    let us define the dynamics for the quantum expectation values and moments .",
    "the effective quantum hamiltonian is given by @xmath38    from there , it is straightforward to obtain the equations of motion for the centroid of the distribution : @xmath39    note that the evolution equation of the position @xmath11 is not modified by the moments . on the contrary ,",
    "the equation of motion for its conjugate momentum @xmath12 does receive corrections due to the presence of the moments @xmath40 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the hamiltonian @xmath41 , which would describe the evolution of a classical distribution on the phase space , it is obtained by replacing the quantum moments @xmath13 by the classical ones @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ hq ] ) .",
    "the centroid of that classical distribution will follow the evolution given by ( [ eqq]-[eqp ] ) , replacing again @xmath13 by @xmath27 .",
    "it is enlightening to combine last two equations in order to obtain the corrected newton equation , @xmath42 the moment terms that appear in this modified equation are sometimes referred as the quantum contributions to the newton equations .",
    "nevertheless , we see from our analysis that the equations of motion for a centroid of a classical distribution in the phase space characterized by moments @xmath27 will obey this very same equation . therefore this equation",
    "must be understood as the fact that the centroid of a distribution does not follow a classical point trajectory .",
    "taking the poisson brackets between moments @xmath13 and the hamiltonian ( [ hq ] ) , and separating the terms with an explicit dependence on @xmath0 , the equations of motion for the quantum moments @xmath13 can be written as    @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\\\label{eqg } & -&\\sum_{n=3}^\\infty\\sum_{k=1}^{m } \\frac{v^{(n)}(q)}{(n-2k-1 ) ! } \\left(\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c } a\\\\2k+1 \\end{array}\\!\\!\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{4}\\right)^k g^{a-2k-1,b+n-2k-1},\\label{momenteq_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath44 being the integer part of @xmath45/2 $ ] .",
    "the evolution equation for the classical moments can be formally obtained from last equation by replacing all @xmath13 by @xmath27 moments and imposing @xmath22 , that is , removing all terms that appear in the second line : @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in summary , eqs .",
    "( [ eqq ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) , in combination with ( [ eqg ] ) , form an infinite closed system of ordinary differential equations that describes the quantum dynamics of a particle on a potential @xmath47 and are completely equivalent to the schrdinger flow of quantum states ( or the heisenberg flow of quantum operators ) . on the other hand , the infinite system composed by eqs .",

    "hence , in order to make these equations useful for a practical purpose , it is necessary to introduce a cutoff by hand , and assume @xmath13 to be vanishing for all @xmath49 , @xmath14 being the maximum order to be considered . in order to impose this cutoff , due to the special properties of the poisson brackets between two moments , care is needed ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . in order to truncate properly the system at an order @xmath14 , taking into account all contributions up to this order",
    ", it is straightforward to see that the upper limit of the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) should be taken as @xmath14 . regarding the equation for the moments ( [ eqg ] )",
    ", the sum of the first line should clearly go up to @xmath50 for the quadratic term in moments , but only up to @xmath51 for the second linear term .",
    "the summations in the second line of that equation are more involved and should be replaced by @xmath52 with @xmath53 and , for every fixed @xmath54 , @xmath55 the maximum between 1 and @xmath56 . for the classical equations ,",
    "the same limits as in their corresponding quantum equations should be imposed .",
    "the validity of this cutoff should be proved _ a posteriori _ by solving the equations of motion with different cutoffs and checking that the solution converges with the cutoff order .",
    "if an integer @xmath14 exists , for which @xmath57 vanishes for all values @xmath58 , the infinite sums on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) will become finite . regarding the quantum @xmath13 ( [ eqg ] ) and the classical moments @xmath27 ( [ eqc ] ) of order @xmath59 , the highest order that appears in their corresponding equations of motion is of order @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , only in the case that @xmath61 the introduction of a cutoff will not be necessary .",
    "this is in fact the case of a harmonic hamiltonian , which will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "the harmonic hamiltonians @xmath9 are defined as those for which all derivatives with respect to the basic variables @xmath7 higher than second order vanish . in the case of a hamiltonian of a particle on a potential ( [ hamiltonian_potential ] ) , this happens when @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "this kind of hamiltonians has very special properties , which were analyzed in ref .",
    "let us briefly summarize its main properties .",
    "first , for this kind of hamiltonians , equations at every order decouple from the rest of the orders .",
    "second , equations of motion of expectation values @xmath7 do not get any correction from moment terms and thus there is no back - reaction .",
    "hence , the centroid of the distribution follows a classical point trajectory .",
    "in addition , given the same initial data , classical and quantum moments have exactly the same evolution since no @xmath0 term appears in the equations of motion .",
    "as will be shown in this section , classical and quantum stationary states differ because the equations of motion do not provide the complete information to fix the value of all moments and thus recursive relation ( [ recursive ] ) will have to be used .",
    "due to the mentioned properties , most of the analysis of this section applies equally to classical as well as to quantum moments .",
    "thus the whole analysis will be performed for quantum moments and emphasis will be made in the particular points where the situation is different for classical moments .",
    "the expectation value of a hamiltonian of a particle on a potential @xmath47 , such that @xmath64 is a constant value , can be written in the following way in terms of expectation values and moments : @xmath65 this is , as explained in previous section , the effective quantum hamiltonian that can be used to obtain the equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the equations of motion for the expectation values @xmath11 and @xmath12 reduce to their usual form , @xmath66 here it can be seen that , as already commented above , there is no back - reaction of moments in the equations for the centroid , in such a way that the centroid follows a classical phase space orbit .    the equations for the moments ( [ momenteq_potential ] ) reduce to ,",
    "@xmath67 the classical moments @xmath27 fulfill this very same equation , replacing all quantum moments @xmath13 by their classical counterparts @xmath27 , as can be readily checked from ( [ eqc ] ) .    as it is well known , it is not necessary to solve eqs .",
    "( [ dqdt_harmonic][dpdt_harmonic ] ) explicitly to obtain the phase - space orbit that is followed by the centroid .",
    "it is sufficient to divide both equations to remove the dependence on time and integrate the resulting equation .",
    "this procedure leads to the implicit solution , @xmath68 @xmath69 being the integration constant that parametrizes different orbits , which can obviously be interpreted as the energy of the centroid .",
    "note that this @xmath69 energy is not the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , since @xmath70 ( and for the classical treatment @xmath41 ) is also a constant of motion , the difference between both , leads to another conserved quantity in terms of second - order moments : @xmath71 ( and @xmath72 for the classical moments ) .",
    "the first derivative of the potential @xmath73 only appears in the evolution equation for the momentum @xmath12 ( [ dpdt_harmonic ] ) and , certainly , the phase - space orbit followed by the centroid ( [ centroid_orbit ] ) depends on the precise form of the potential .",
    "nonetheless , note that the equations of the moments ( [ dgdt_harmonic ] ) only depend on the second derivative of the potential @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , in order to fully analyze the evolution of the moments , the study will be split in the two possible and physically different cases : @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the former describes a particle moving under a uniform force , whereas the latter corresponds to the harmonic ( @xmath77 ) and the inverse harmonic ( @xmath78 ) oscillators .      in this subsection",
    "the generic linear potential @xmath80 will be analyzed . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath81 will be chosen to be vanishing .",
    "this potential represents a particle under a constant force .",
    "the case of a free particle @xmath82 will also be included in the analysis .",
    "as explained above , in this case all orders decouple and the centroid of the distribution follows a classical point trajectory in phase space : @xmath83 , with @xmath69 a constant value . since the full hamiltonian @xmath70 is also a constant of motion , it is obvious then that the moment @xmath84 is also constant during the evolution . in fact , looking at the equations of motion ( [ dgdt_harmonic ] ) , it is immediate to see that the fluctuations of the momentum at all orders @xmath85 are constants of motion .",
    "let us first analyze the stationary states , that is , the fixed points of the dynamical system .",
    "dropping all time derivatives in the system of equations ( [ dqdt_harmonic][dgdt_harmonic ] ) , it is straightforward to see that only the free particle ( @xmath86 ) case allows for stationary solutions that would be given by @xmath87 ( particle at rest ) and all moments @xmath13 vanishing for all @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the position @xmath11 and its fluctuations at all orders @xmath90 could , in principle , take any value .",
    "that is , the particle can be anywhere and with an unbounded uncertainty in its position . nonetheless , even if this choice of moments is valid for the classical case , it is not for the quantum case since it violates the heisenberg uncertainty relation ( [ heisenberg ] ) .",
    "therefore as it is well known , and contrary to the classical case , no stationary state can be constructed for the free quantum particle .",
    "the analytical solution for a dynamical state can be found explicitly for the evolution of all moments , @xmath91 for initial data @xmath92 .",
    "the evolution of the moments is independent of the value of @xmath93 , thus this solution is valid both for the case of the free particle and the particle under a uniform force .",
    "as can be seen , each moment is given by a linear combination of the initial value of the moments of its corresponding order with polynomial coefficients on the time parameter .",
    "the state spreads away from its initial configuration and , for large times , the moments @xmath13 increase as @xmath94 .",
    "the initial conditions of this state are still free . for instance",
    ", it is possible to choose an initial state of minimum uncertainty but , even so , all moments , except the constants of motion @xmath85 , will increase with time .",
    "it is well known that any potential of the form @xmath96 can be taken to the form @xmath97 by a shift of the variable @xmath98 and a redefinition of the value of the potential at its minimum ( @xmath99 ) , which does not have any physical meaning . if @xmath74 is positive , this is the potential of a harmonic oscillator , a ubiquitous system in all branches of physics .",
    "since the equations of motion for expectation values ( [ dqdt_harmonic][dpdt_harmonic ] ) do not get any backreaction by moments , their solutions are oscillatory functions and they follow an elliptical orbit in phase space . on the other hand , the case @xmath78 corresponds to the inverted harmonic oscillator .",
    "this system can be viewed as an oscillator with imaginary frequency .",
    "the solution for the expectation values @xmath7 are hyperbolic functions and they follow hyperbolas in phase space . in the rest of this subsection",
    "the behavior of the moments will be considered for both systems .",
    "let us first analyze the stationary states .",
    "equaling to zero the right - hand side of the equations of motion ( [ dqdt_harmonic][dgdt_harmonic ] ) , the equilibrium point @xmath100 for the expectation values , as well as the recursive relation @xmath101 for the moments are obtained .",
    "the solution to this recursive relation is given by the following condition for moments with both indices even numbers , @xmath102 whereas the rest of the moments must vanish .",
    "if the sign of @xmath74 was negative , that would impose some moments with even indices to be negative .",
    "this is not acceptable since all moments of the form @xmath103 are non - negative by construction ( [ eveneven ] ) .",
    "thus , from here it is immediately concluded that the inverse oscillator can not have stationary states .",
    "as can be appreciated in the last relation ( [ recsol1 ] ) , even if the information concerning the stationary state contained in the equations of motion has been exhausted , there is still one freedom left at each order .",
    "this freedom is represented in this equation by the high - order fluctuations of the position @xmath29 .    in order to fix the moments @xmath29 , the recursive relation ( [ recursive ] ) can be made use of .",
    "for the potential under consideration , that relation reads @xmath104 this last equation allows us to compute all @xmath29 moments as function of the energy at the stationary point @xmath105 and planck constant @xmath0 . taking the limit @xmath25 , the ( two point ) recursive relation obeyed by classical moments is obtained , which can be easily solved . combining this solution with ( [ recsol1 ] )",
    ", the classical moments corresponding to a stationary situation of the harmonic oscillator can be written in a closed form .",
    "those with two even indices read @xmath106 and the rest are vanishing .",
    "the quantum case is a little bit more involved .",
    "the second - order moments @xmath84 and @xmath107 have the same form as their classical counterparts in terms of the energy @xmath108 and the frequency @xmath109 ( [ oscillatorcmoments ] ) . but",
    "higher - order moments will take corrections as a power series in the parameter @xmath110 when solving the recursive relation ( [ oscillatorrec ] ) . here",
    "we give the explicit expression of all the fluctuations of the position @xmath29 up to order ten : @xmath111 the rest of the nonvanishing moments are proportional to these and can be obtained by using the solution ( [ recsol1 ] ) .",
    "note that a quantum moment @xmath13 is equal to its classical counterpart ( [ oscillatorcmoments ] ) plus certain corrections that are given as an even power series in @xmath0 .",
    "this power series goes from @xmath110 up to @xmath112 , @xmath54 being the integer part of @xmath113 .",
    "the only information that is left here is the exact form of the energy spectrum : @xmath114 .",
    "this is the only input needed in order to obtain the complete realization of the system .",
    "in fact , one could obtain all the moments corresponding to the ground state by assuming that it is an unsqueezed state with minimum uncertainty that saturates the heisenberg relation ( [ heisenberg ] ) , @xmath115 , which implies @xmath116 .",
    "in addition note that , as expected , for this ground state the expression of the quantum moments reduces to the moments corresponding to a gaussian probability distribution with width @xmath117 .",
    "[ the explicit expression for the moments of a gaussian state is given below ( [ gaussiang ] ) . ]    regarding the dynamical states , it is easy to solve the equations of motion ( [ dqdt_harmonic][dgdt_harmonic ] ) .",

    "different cutoffs have been considered ( specifically @xmath14= 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 ) and the mentioned system of equations , in combination with relation ( [ relat ] ) and the definition of the energy ( [ energy_quartic ] ) , has been analytically solved .",
    "the idea behind performing this computation for several cutoffs is to study the convergence of the solution , that is , to check whether the solution for the moments does not change when considering higher - order cutoffs .    in principle , there are two different solutions : one that corresponds to the classical stationary configuration ( and thus its equilibrium position is at the origin @xmath135 ) and another , for which the position must not be vanishing [ note that this is possible due to the moment terms that appear in the hamilton equation ( [ pquartic ] ) ] and does not have a classical point counterpart .",

    "the only ingredient that is not derived by the present formalism , and thus one needs to include by hand , are the eigenvalues of the energy .",
    "finally , it has been proven that the inverse harmonic oscillator can not have stationary states .    concerning the pure quartic oscillator ,",
    "the moments corresponding to any stationary state have been derived by making use of the above technique . in this case , the system of equations is not complete and thus it does not fix the whole set of moments .",
    "hence , apart from the energy of the state , the fluctuation of the position has been left as a free parameter .",
    "furthermore , in order to constraint the values of these two parameters , use has been made of the high - order inequalities which were derived in @xcite .",
    "for the particular case of the ground state , a reasonable assumption is that the heisenberg uncertainty relation is saturated .",
    "this leads to a tight interval for the value of the ground energy ( [ interval6 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the exact ( numerically computed ) value of this energy is not contained in this interval , but it is quite close . therefore one can assert that , even if the exact saturation of the heisenberg uncertainty relation provides a good approximation for the ground state of the pure quartic oscillator , it is not exactly obeyed .",
    "the above analysis shows the practical relevance of the inequalities that were derived in @xcite as a complementary method to extract physical information from the system . in particular , high - order inequalities are of relevance because the conditions they provide are stronger than the ones obtained from lower - order inequalities .    finally , a numerical computation of the dynamical states corresponding to the pure quartic oscillator has been performed . to that end",
    ", a gaussian in the position has been assumed as the initial state . in this setting , a number of interesting results have been obtained .",
    "first , the validity of the method has been analyzed .",
    "the present formalism is valid as long as the high - order moments that one drops with the cutoff are small .",
    "the natural tendency of the moments in this system is to oscillate with a growing amplitude and thus , from certain point on , this method will not give trustable results . in order to find the region of validity of the method , on the one hand ,",
    "different cutoffs have been considered and the convergence of the solution with the cutoff order has been studied . on the other hand , the conservation of the hamiltonian , as well as the fulfillment of the high - order inequalities mentioned above , has been monitored during the evolution . with these control methods at hand , one can estimate when ( after how many cycles ) the formalism is not valid anymore . in particular , this `` validity time '' increases with the value of the initial classical energy .",
    "second , the departure of the centroid from its classical point trajectory has been analyzed , as well as the relative relevance of the two different quantum effects : the distributional and the purely quantum effects .",
    "it has been shown that , as one would expect , the former ones , which are also present in the evolution of a classical probability distribution , are much more relevant than the latter ones .",
    "nonetheless , the strength of the purely quantum effects in the equations of motion is of order @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , a change in the numerical value of the planck constant would tune the relative relevance of these effects .",
    "finally , the correspondence principle has also been verified in the sense that the larger the classical initial value of the energy is chosen , the smaller purely quantum effects are measured . in particular",
    ", the smallness of the quantity @xmath243 , as defined in ( [ gamma ] ) , gives a precise notion of semiclassicality .",
    "in fact the vanishing of @xmath243 would define a complete classical ( distributional ) behavior of the system .",
    "let us stress the fact that this classical behavior is distributional .",
    "in other words , and as commented already throughout the paper , the classical limit of a quantum state is not a unique orbit on the phase space but , instead , an ensemble of classical trajectories which are described by a probability distribution or , in the context of the present formalism , by its classical moments .    the author thanks carlos barcel , ral carballo - rubio , iaki garay , claus kiefer , manuel krmer , and hannes schenck for discussions and comments .",
    "special thanks to martin bojowald for interesting comments on a previous version of this manuscript .",
    "financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation through a postdoctoral fellowship is gratefully acknowledged .",
