    "superradiance is a phenomenon in which impinging waves are amplified as they scatter off a rotating black hole , e.g. , the kerr black hole , by extracting its angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it is also known that a similar phenomenon , a charge extraction , happens for a charged black hole , e.g. , the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole or the kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole , if impinging waves have a charge @xcite . using hawking s area theorem @xcite ,",

    "if the effect of rotation is included , the angular momentum and/or charge extraction condition is generalized to @xmath18 , which is referred to as `` the superradiance condition '' in this study , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the rotation angular velocity of the black hole and the azimuthal quantum number of the wave field , respectively . since the quasinormal frequencies of the uncharged massless field do not satisfy the superradiance condition , the angular momentum and/or the charge extraction",

    "the ads boundary behaves as an effective wall that encloses the black hole and waves in ads space are reflected inward at the ads boundary .",
    "as argued in @xcite , thus , a black hole in ads spacetime may be modeled by a black hole in a spherical container whose length scale is given by the ads scale @xmath3 ( see sec .",
    "thus , the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole in ads spacetime are scaled by @xmath21 as long as the black hole event horizon radius @xmath2 is sufficiently smaller than the ads scale @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the nondimensional quasinormal frequency @xmath23 of the black hole in ads spacetime unboundedly decreases with decreasing the nondimensional horizon radius of the black hole @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "if the effect of the black hole is taken into account , the quasinormal frequency @xmath77 becomes complex and may be written as _ q ( _q+ e c ) = _ 0 + i , for small ads black holes characterized by @xmath0 , where the subscript `` _ q _ '' to the right of @xmath42 is attached to emphasize that the @xmath42 is the quasinormal frequency of the black hole . here , @xmath78 has been assumed as already mentioned .    matching the near region solution with the far region solution in the intermediate region , we obtain the frequency correction @xmath79 , whose sign basically determines stability of the black hole . by using properties of the gamma function",

    "this instability condition implies that the lowest order mode , characterized by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , places the most strict condition on the instability , i.e. , @xmath94 , at least in the limit of @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath95 , we also see that the small black hole is always stable against the charged scalar perturbations with @xmath96 .    from the behavior of the radial function near the horizon , @xmath97 ,",

    ", an observer far from the black hole recognizes that the waves are coming out from the black hole if the instability condition is satisfied , @xmath98 .",

    "the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency is so small that the eigenfunction can be evaluated by direct numerical integration of the wave equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use the direct numerical integration method to obtain the quasinormal frequency of the black hole . since",

    "we obtain reliable results in the range @xmath141 for both the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies .",
    "we see that the results for the black holes with @xmath137 and @xmath123 are similar to those for the black hole with @xmath126 .",
    "the oscillation frequencies increase as the black hole charge increases , when the charge of the scalar field is @xmath132 , while the oscillation frequencies decrease as the black hole charge increases , when the scalar field is uncharged .",
    "it is found that for the scalar perturbations with @xmath132 , im@xmath142 if @xmath143 for the @xmath139 black hole and if @xmath144 for the @xmath125 black hole .",
    "again , we certainly have re@xmath145 for the modes characterized by im@xmath142 or the unstable modes .",
    "we also calculate the @xmath146 fundamental modes having @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 for the black hole with @xmath147 and the results are given in figs .  7 and 8 .",
    "we see that although the qualitative properties of the real parts of the frequency are basically independent of the value of @xmath45 , the qualitative properties of the imaginary parts of the frequency for the @xmath146 modes are different from those for the @xmath93 modes .",
    "it is found that for the @xmath146 perturbations , regardless of the value of @xmath7 , the imaginary parts of the frequency increase as the black hole charge increases and approach to zero although they stay negative .",

    "when the scalar field has a positive charge , the oscillation frequencies linearly decrease as the charge of the black hole increases .",
    "note that for the @xmath127 case , the result is the same as that of the @xmath34 case .",

    "10 and 11 .",
    "these show that our numerical results are in a good agreement with the analytical ones as long as the horizon radius of the black hole is sufficiently small .",
    "for all the results obtained in the present study , the real parts of the quasinormal mode frequency for the @xmath127 perturbations are of monotonically increasing functions of the black hole charge .",
    "this makes a sharp contrast with that for the large rn - ads black hole cases @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , it is expected that a sufficiently small reissner - nordstrm ads black hole is unstable against the charged scalar perturbations due to the superradiance charge extraction .",
    "we have proved that this expectation is correct by calculating the quasinormal modes of a massless charged scalar field on the reissner - nordstrm ads black hole .",
    "we have confirmed both with the analytical and numerical approaches that the small rn - ads black hole becomes unstable if the normal mode satisfies the superradiance condition .",
    "the studies on the stability of the black hole and the superradiance that have been done so far suggest that the superradiant condition indeed plays an important roll in stability of the black hole irrespective of the structure of infinity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for a small rn - ads black hole , @xmath0 , we have re@xmath156 ( see eq .",

    "this can be confirmed in the present results ( see sections ii.c and iii ) . for a large rn - ads black hole , @xmath159 ,",
    "on the other hand , the superradiance condition can be satisfied for a scalar field with a sufficiently large charge , @xmath160 , because the quasinormal mode frequency is characterized by re@xmath161 @xcite .",
    "but , so far , we have not known whether or not a large rn - ads black hole becomes unstable due to the superradiance charge extraction .",
    "maeda et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the rn - ads black holes having a large @xmath2 become unstable below a critical temperature and that the instability results in the charge extraction from the black hole . however , the instability they found is independent of the sign of the scalar field charge @xmath7 .",
    "thus they concluded that the instability is not directly related with the superradiance .",
    "note that the instability studied in this paper depends on the sign of @xmath7 , i.e. , the instability condition is never satisfied for the black hole with @xmath162 if @xmath163 .",

    "not only the ads boundary but also the mass of the perturbation field behaves like an effective confining wall around a black hole .",
    "furuhashi and nambu @xcite have investigated charged massive scalar perturbations of the kerr - newman black hole , which is a rotating charged black hole in asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "they demonstrated that the instability condition is given by the superradiance condition and that instability appears only for the rotating black hole and there is no instability in the rn black hole .",
    "this means that the confining wall created by the mass of the scalar field can not make the charged spherically symmetric black hole unstable .",
    "this is quite a contrast to the case of the ads boundary examined in the present study .",
    "we have investigated the quasinormal modes of the massless charged scalar field on the rn - ads black holes both analytically and numerically for the cases of @xmath0 . in the analytical approach , by using the small black hole approximation ( @xmath0 ) , we obtain the quasinormal mode frequencies in the limit of @xmath1 .",
    "we then show that the small rn - ads black holes are unstable if their quasinormal modes satisfy the superradiance condition and that the instability condition of the rn - ads black hole in the limit of @xmath1 is given by @xmath165 .",
    "we also calculate the quasinormal modes numerically for the small rn - ads black holes with @xmath0 and confirm that the imaginary part of the frequency certainly changes the sign when the superradiance condition is satisfied .",
    "our numerical results show that the black holes with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 becomes unstable against scalar perturbations with @xmath11 when the charge of the black hole satisfies @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , respectively .",
    "we compare our numerical results with the analytical results and confirm that our numerical results are perfectly consistent with the analytical ones .",
    "as mentioned before , it is interesting and important to generalize the present analysis to the large rn - ads black hole cases and to investigate the relation between the superradiance condition and the instability .",

    "<S> we investigate quasinormal modes of a massless charged scalar field on a small reissner - nordstrm - anti - de sitter ( rn - ads ) black hole both with analytical and numerical approaches . in the analytical approach , by using the small black hole approximation ( @xmath0 ) , we obtain the quasinormal mode frequencies in the limit of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the black hole event horizon radius and the ads scale , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the small rn - ads black hole is unstable if its quasinormal modes satisfy the superradiance condition and that the instability condition of the rn - ads black hole in the limit of @xmath1 is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the charge of the black hole , the critical ( maximum ) charge of the black hole , and the charge of the scalar field , respectively . in the numerical approach , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the quasinormal modes for the small rn - ads black holes with @xmath0 and confirm that the rn - ads black hole is unstable if its quasinormal modes satisfy the superradiance condition . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that the rn - ads black holes with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 become unstable against scalar perturbations with @xmath11 when the charge of the black hole satisfies @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively . </S>"
