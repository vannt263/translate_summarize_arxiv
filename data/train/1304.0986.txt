    "broad absorption line quasars ( balqs ) are a subtype of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , defined by the presence of broad and blue - shifted absorption features ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic fraction of balqs from the total quasar population is estimated to be @xmath2 per cent ( @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim it can be as high as @xmath3 per cent ) .",
    "while there are several differences in emission properties between balqs and non - balqs , balqs appear to be drawn from the non - balq population @xcite .",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) , and the  bal in particular , span a large range in depth , width and overall velocity shift ( ) between different objects . for most balqs , absorption is observed only in high - ionization lines ( these objects are termed ` hibalqs ' ) . for a smaller fraction of balqs , absorption is also observed in low - ionization lines , e.g.  ( ` lobalqs ' ) . the predominant unifying model states that the difference between the agn subtypes is our viewing angle towards the quasar central regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , an alternative scenario suggests that lobalqs are an evolutionary stage of agn , in which the nucleus expels a surrounding dusty ` cocoon ' ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    what are the average balq spectral properties shortward of , and near the lyman limit ?",
    "most of balq studies analyse spectra only down to  of  ( e.g. , @xcite ) or  ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this study , we utilize the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) dr7 quasar catalogue @xcite , and investigate high-@xmath4 @xmath5 object spectra , which cover  from  down to @xmath6   . the spectra of @xmath7 quasars are heavily absorbed by the intervening lyman forest at @xmath8   .",
    "we overcome this foreground absorption and derive the balq intrinsic absorption by taking the ratio of the average spectrum of balqs and the average spectrum of a matched control sample of non - balqs .",
    "the ratio spectrum allows us to place a limit on the average lyman edge depth associated with the bal systems , and thus a limit on the covering factor ( cf ) of low ionization bal system .",
    "we also extend earlier studies on the average absorption strength of ,  and  to the higher ionization  and  bals .",
    "the ratio spectrum is meaningful only if the average emission properties of balqs and non - balqs are indeed the same .",
    "various studies find systematic differences between the intrinsic emission properties of balqs and non - balqs .",
    "there are reports that balqs are located on the high-@xmath9 and high-  end of the @xcite eigenvector 1 @xcite .",
    "balqs are observed to have larger blueshifts of  emission than non - balqs @xcite , and lobalqs to have the highest blueshifts @xcite .",
    "balqs are found to be redder than non - balqs @xcite , and lobalqs to be redder than hibalqs @xcite .",
    "the reddening is interpreted by some authors as a result of balqs being viewed preferentially closer to edge on ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or as an imprint of a dusty ` cocoon ' ( see references above ) .",
    "@xcite find the emission lines to be broader for balqs than for non - balqs .",
    "balqs are reported to have lower  equivalent width ( ew ) than non - balqs , x - ray weaker balqs are observed to have stronger bals with larger terminal velocities , and the measured velocities are larger for higher-@xmath10 balqs @xcite .",
    "lobalqs show the strongest and broadest high - ionization absorption lines @xcite .    thus , to make a more accurate ratio spectrum one needs to use samples of balqs and non - balqs with a similar distribution of intrinsic emission properties .",
    "one can then take another step , and explore whether the derived absorption properties , in particular the average  absorption profile , depend on the intrinsic emission properties , such as .",
    "for this purpose , we expand our study to @xmath11 quasars , where one can observe the 14003000  range , and derive emission parameters , such as , based on the  @xmath122798 broad emission line . despite numerous studies , the intrinsic properties which underlie the diversity of bals remain elusive .",
    "this study allows us to address what causes the large diversity of the observed bal properties    we explore in this study the dependence of the  bal properties on the  ew and on the uv slope ( ) .",
    "this exploration is motivated by the following .",
    "the  ew is a measure of the strength of the extreme uv ( euv ) continuum above 54  ev , compared to the near uv continuum , and there are reports that balqs have on average lower  ew than non - balqs @xcite . a broad line region ( blr ) wind component is reported to be affected by the ionizing continuum hardness ( @xcite , based on  ew ; @xcite , based on @xmath13 ) , and the blr wind component is suggested by @xcite to be possibly relevant to the balq phenomenon . in addition ,  is correlated with reddening ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and since reddening is more common in balqs ( see above ) , this implies a possible relationship between  and balq properties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the data analysis method is described in section  [ sec : methods ] . in section  [ sec : mean_prop ] we analyse composite spectra of the balq and non - balq samples , find a trend between the ionization potential and the average bal depth , and constrain the average  absorber properties . in section",
    "[ sec : what_is_driver ] we investigate what parameters span the  bal properties . a physical interpretation to our findings",

    "the object balq classification is adopted from the @xcite quasar catalogue . from @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite use the @xcite balq classification for objects that are included in the sdss dr5 , and classify the remaining objects based on a visual inspection of the  region .",
    "note that @xcite use a modified version of ` balnicity index ' ( bi ) of @xcite to detect balqs , which they term bi@xmath14 .",
    "they integrate the continuum - normalized spectral flux starting from a blueshift of 0 , rather than @xmath15  km  s@xmath16  used in the traditional bi .",
    "we include in the data set only objects with @xmath17 in the sdss _",
    "i_-filter , to avoid unusually low - s / n spectra ( the s / n criterion excludes @xmath18 per cent of the objects ; see below ) .",
    "we divide the data set into two subsets that cover different  ranges as described below .    1 .   the @xmath19    range i.e. , @xmath20 for the sdss ( hereafter , the ` high-@xmath4 ' sample )",
    ". the lower limit on @xmath4 is set to allow a detection of lyman limit absorption intrinsic to the balqs , and the upper limit is set to detect the continuum redward of the  emission complex .",
    "the dr7 covers this @xmath4 range for 228 balqs and 1320 non - balqs .",
    "the @xmath17 criterion leads to 200 balqs and 1142 non - balqs .",
    "2 .   the @xmath21    range i.e. , @xmath22 for the sdss ( hereafter , the ` low-@xmath4 ' sample ) .",
    "the lower and upper limits are placed to cover the  bal and the  emission line , respectively .",
    "the dr7 contains 1691 balqs and 13,388 non - balqs in this range .",
    "the s / n criterion excludes 39 balqs and 739 non - balqs .",
    "since lobalqs are a distinct subtype of balqs , with redder spectra than the more common hibalqs @xcite , we exclude from the low-@xmath4 balq sample 56 objects with a detected  bal @xcite , and construct a sample of low-@xmath4 hibalqs only .",
    "we do not construct a similar high-@xmath4 hibalq sample , as it is not clear which low - ionization absorption line at @xmath23    matches the  absorption line .",
    "note that @xcite do not conduct a systematic search for  balqs in the post - dr5 quasar sample , and report only serendipitously found  balqs for this sample .",
    "thus , the exclusion of lobalqs from the low-@xmath4 balq sample might be incomplete .",
    "@xcite report a  balq fraction of 1.3 per cent of quasars for dr3 ( i.e.  164 objects in our sample ) , where bals are detected using the ` absorption index ' @xmath24 criterion , while @xcite , who use the @xmath25 criterion , find a smaller fraction of 0.3 per cent for dr6 ( 38 objects ) .",
    "the different fractions result from the different definitions of ai and bi .",
    "( @xmath25 ) requires at least one continuous absorption trough with a minimal absorption depth of 0.1 and a minimal width of 1000  km  s@xmath16  ( 2000  km  s@xmath16 ) in the @xmath26  km  s@xmath16  ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath16 ) range . ]",
    "thus , our low-@xmath4 hibalq sample is likely contaminated by @xmath28 lobalqs which pass the @xmath24 criterion , but none of these pass the @xmath25 criterion",
    ". the final low-@xmath4 sample is comprised of 1596 hibalqs and 12,649 non - balqs .",
    "since the spectra of high-@xmath4 objects have a relatively low s / n ( a median value of @xmath29 per resolution element at continuum regions unaffected by absorption and strong emission ) in the @xmath30    window . ] , the spectra are smoothed by a 22 pixel - wide moving average filter , which allows to achieve a median s / n of @xmath31 per resolution element [ the filter width is equivalent to @xmath32 resolution elements i.e. , @xmath33  km  s@xmath16  @xcite ] .",
    "the spectra of low-@xmath4 objects are smoothed by the same filter , yielding a median s / n of @xmath34 per resolution element .",

    "median spectra are calculated by utilizing a modified median method .",
    "a simple mean is not adopted as the representative average spectrum , since it can be affected by outliers .",
    "outliers have a negligible effect on the median , but the median yields a relatively ` noisier ' composite compared to the mean .",
    "we utilize a modified median method , which is a hybrid between the standard median and the mean , and which mitigates the shortcomings of the two methods .",
    "first , the object spectra are sorted based on the normalized @xmath37 .",
    "then , 10 per cent of the objects above and 10 per cent of the objects below the median are marked .",
    "finally , the mean @xmath38 of the marked objects is adopted as the composite @xmath38 at a given  ( a similar method is used to calculate the libor interest rate in economy ) .",
    "the intrinsic balq absorption is evaluated by utilizing the non - balq sample .",
    "the non - balq composite is assumed to represent the intrinsically unabsorbed emission of the balqs ( the construction of composites matched in emission properties is described below ) .",
    "the ratio between the balq and non - balq composites ( hereafter the @xmath39 spectrum ) is interpreted as the intrinsic balq absorption spectrum .",
    "since the ratio does not remove an overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) differences between balqs and non - balqs , we fit a straight - line continuum across the profile from @xmath40 to @xmath41  km  s@xmath16 . a residual  emission , if present , has little effect on the  measurements .",
    "the caveat of our approach is that if there are significant intrinsic differences in line emission within the absorbed region for balqs , then the derived absorption profile will be biased .",
    "the individual absorption profiles are often characterized by a relatively narrow absorption peak .",
    "this characteristic profile is smeared out when forming the composite , due to the distribution of peak absorption velocities . in order to investigate the median ` bal rest - frame ' absorption profile near the absorption peak",
    ", we also form a composite based on the aligned  peak - absorption .",
    "this composite , calculated for the high-@xmath4 balqs , allows to detect relatively narrow ( @xmath42  km  s@xmath16 ) and weak absorption lines which are otherwise heavily blended in the crowded fuv region , and also provides some hint on the optical depth of resolved multiplet absorption .",
    "the balq spectra are aligned by shifting each spectrum in velocity , so that the maximum absorption of  falls at the same velocity for all spectra .",
    "then , a composite of the aligned spectra is calculated .",
    "the 22-pixel spectral smoothing by a relatively broad filter , smooths out any narrow features ( @xmath43  km  s@xmath16 ) superimposed on the  bal , and reduces their effect on the alignment procedure .",
    "when the matched non - balq sample is constructed , a similar distribution of velocity shifts is used .",
    "we study the dependence of the balq absorption properties on the following parameters .    1 .   the  ew , which may serve as a measure of the euv ionizing sed hardness .",
    "the  ew is measured by integrating the normalized @xmath44 in the @xmath45    range , assuming @xmath46 i.e. , a constant @xmath47 between the normalization window ( 17001720   ) and @xmath48   .",
    "the adopted  range minimizes contributions from  and ] @xmath491661 , 1666 to the evaluated  ew . using a constant @xmath47 corresponds to a spectral slope of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , which serves as a rough approximation for the local slope ( section  [ sec : trends_auv ] ) .",

    "alternatively , the  ew may indicate the fraction of the sky of the ionizing continuum covered by the blr gas @xmath239 instead of a measure of the strength of the euv continuum above 54  ev . however , there are various relations favouring the interpretation of the  ew as an ionizing sed indicator .",

    "[ fig : ew_subs_ab1400 ] ) , and then each  ew bin is binned based on @xmath54 .",
    "the upper left corner in each panel provides the median  ew ( in  ) for the balq / non - balq bins used to generate the plotted ratio .",
    "the corresponding values for the four @xmath311 bins ( in erg  s@xmath16 ) are indicated in the lower left corner of each panel .",
    "note that for the lower two  ew bins ( two lower panels ) , the highest @xmath54 composite ( blue line ) has the deepest absorption trough at @xmath312  km  s@xmath16.,width=317 ]    the highest  ew bin shows very similar  as a function of @xmath9 . here",
    "the peak absorption occurs at @xmath313  km  s@xmath16 , and the absorbing material may still be confined close to the blr , i.e.  to the base of the outflow .",
    "overionization occurs just as the outflow starts to build up , before radiation pressure has time to build up a significant outflow component , beyond the initial dispersion in the velocity .",
    "only when the  ew is low enough , to allow significant acceleration , the effect of @xmath9 starts to appear .",
    "clearly , large samples which span a large range in @xmath9 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , are needed to explore the radiation pressure interpretation , and clearly separate out the effect of @xmath9 and the  ew on the outflow .",
