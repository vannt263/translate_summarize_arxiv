    "update the ordering accordingly .",
    "* moving a variable @xmath292 into @xmath288 - no change .",
    "only the cardinalities of @xmath288 and @xmath290 will change accordingly .",

    "we now proceed to find all the variables that are hr orthogonal with @xmath295 and not hr orthogonal with @xmath287 , since these will need to be jointly decoded with the variables in @xmath287 .",

    "we also need to ensure that this variable is not hr orthogonal with @xmath287 .",
    "so , we traverse the @xmath245-th row from column 1 to column @xmath297 and check for any non - zero entries . in case any of them are found , it means that this variable needs to be jointly decoded with @xmath287 .",
    "we add @xmath296 to @xmath287 .",
    "we now repeat the procedure on the variable @xmath295 again until all the variables have been exhausted . since there are a finite number of variables , this process terminates .",

    "these variables will be accounted for later .",
    "we now add @xmath295 to @xmath288 .",
    "we have now managed to create two sets which are hr orthogonal and the current ordering of the variables is @xmath298 .",

    "in such a case , we repeat the procedure of finding any variable that needs to be jointly decoded with @xmath287 on this variable as well .",
    "if any such variable exists , we move that variable and the pre - existing variables of @xmath288 into @xmath287 .",

    "we repeat the same procedure on these variables considering them as independent hrqf matrices .",
    "if the cardinality of @xmath287 is the same as that of the hrqf matrix row / column size , then we stop this procedure as it can not be ordered any further and set the fsd complexity to @xmath297 .",
    "this process terminates as the sizes of @xmath287 and @xmath288 keep reducing with each iteration and there are a finite number of variables .",
    "we calculate the fsd complexity of this ordering as - @xmath299 where @xmath300 and @xmath301 are the fsd complexities of @xmath287 and @xmath288 respectively .",
    "since we are dealing with fast sphere decoding and grouping the variables as sets @xmath285 and @xmath286 are the only possible ways to obtain a structure that will allow fs decoding , these are all the orderings we need to consider if we take @xmath98 as the first variable .",
    "hence , we have exhausted all the possible orderings which can provide fs decoding with @xmath98 as the first variable , and a best possible fsd complexity for this case has been found by the above steps .",
    "now , if we run through all the variables of the stbc making each one of them the first variable in turn and repeating the above procedure , we can find out a best possible fsd complexity for all possible orderings .",
