    "the leading proposal for the mechanism of core - collapse supernova explosions is that the shock first stalls and then regains its energy through heating of the material behind it by streaming neutrinos @xcite . within this paradigm a crucial role is played by vigorous convection behind the shock front @xcite .",
    "this convection , clearly seen in modern multidimensional simulations @xcite , brings the energy deposited by neutrinos in dense regions to the region behind the stalled shock front ( for a recent overview and references see , e.g. , @xcite ) . besides the shock revival",
    ", the convection leads to asymmetric accretion onto the protoneutron star , providing a compelling explanation for the high observed pulsar velocities @xcite .",
    "finally , evidence for the convection comes from observations of sn1987a that indicate extensive mixing during the early stages of the explosion @xcite .",
    "turbulent convective motions create a fluctuating density field in the post - shock region .",
    "importantly , these fluctuations remain long after the shock restarts and a successful explosion is obtained @xcite . in particular , they persist over the duration of the neutrino burst ( @xmath1 sec ) and can thus modulate the msw flavor transformations of the neutrinos .",
    "the goal of the present work is to show that the turbulence seen in the simulations indeed leaves an imprint on the neutrino signal , possibly starting from about 3 - 4 seconds after the onset of the explosion .",
    "this imprint may replace , or combine with , signatures of other features already discussed in the literature , such as the passage of the front @xcite and reverse @xcite shocks through the resonance layer ( see also @xcite ) , or effects of low - density bubbles @xcite .",
    "a core - collapse supernova emits both neutrinos and antineutrinos , of all three flavors , with energies @xmath210 - 20 mev .",
    "the spectra and luminosities for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are in general different . on the way out of the star ,",
    "the neutrinos undergo matter - enhanced flavor transformations at certain characteristic (  resonant \" ) densities ,",
    "@xmath7 g/@xmath8 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 or  high \" resonance ) and @xmath11 g/@xmath8 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 or  low \" resonance ) . ev@xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 ev@xmath14 ( the best fit to the atmospheric / k2k / minos data @xcite ) . notice that factors of @xmath16 , which traditionally appear in the definition of the resonance , lead to physically incorrect conclusions for large mixing angles @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath13 resonance the traditional definition implies that the flavor transformation should happen either in the neutrino or antineutrino channel , while in reality significant transformation occurs in both . ]",
    "these transformations permute the neutrinos in various flavors and determine the neutrino spectra detected on earth .",
    "to estimate the effect of the turbulence on the permutation efficiency , we need to know the spectrum of the density fluctuations in the turbulence and the response of neutrino evolution to stochastic fluctuations of different sizes .",
    "the two tasks are tightly coupled .",
    "the fluctuations relevant to neutrino evolution turn out to be smaller than the resolution of the present simulations and , hence , must be inferred from the large - scale features seen in the simulations by physical arguments . at the same time , the spectrum of fluctuations in a physical turbulence is very different from the  @xmath17-correlated \" noise for which analytical solutions for neutrino evolution exist @xcite .",
    "the appropriate treatment will be developed here .",
    "as we will see , the scales of interest are @xmath18 km . unless @xmath19 , these are much smaller than the local scale height @xmath20 at @xmath21 sec . due to",
    "rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholts instabilities , which are clearly seen in the simulations , kolmogorov cascade into smaller scales should develop .",
    "density ( just like velocity ) will then exhibit power - law fluctuations on all inertial range scales , that is on all scales between @xmath20 and viscous cut - off @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 for the kolmogorov turbulence the fourier transform of the velocity correlator has @xmath25 .",
    "we will consider the range @xmath26 .",
    "( [ eq : cpowerlaw ] ) implies that a density variation between two points separated by a distance @xmath27 scales as @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] . for @xmath29",
    "the variation has a strong unphysical dependence on the uv cutoff , @xmath30 , and diverges as @xmath31 .",
    "this is obvious for the @xmath17-correlated noise , @xmath32 , for which @xmath33 : the small - scale variation is infinite . even if one tries to make sense of the @xmath17-correlated noise by imposing an _ ad - hoc _ uv cutoff , one has no connection with a realistic turbulence . on the contrary , @xmath34 is physical as everything is related to the fluctuations on the largest scales .",
    "flavor transformations in a medium with this spectrum of the fluctuations , to the best of our knowledge , have not been treated in the literature .",
    "we consider a 2-flavor system which goes through a  noisy \" level - crossing , with a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we take the hamiltonian @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and set @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "the parameters are chosen such that for @xmath45 the evolution is adiabatic ( the adiabaticity parameter @xmath46 ) , and the relevant range @xmath47 ( see later ) is covered .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depolarization_log ] .",
    "three different regimes are clearly seen : ( i ) for small noise @xmath51 its effects are negligible ; @xmath52 is dictated entirely by the smooth component of the profile .",
    "( ii ) as the noise is increased , a stochastic scatter appears ; from @xmath53 to @xmath54 the average survival probability  shown by the diamonds  grows _ as a power law _ with @xmath42 .",

    "this result , well - known in the case of the @xmath17-correlated noise , is expected in general .",
    "[ fig : depolarization_log ] suggests that to understand the impact of the density noise on neutrinos it is enough to derive the expression for @xmath52 in the intermediate power - law regime .",
    "if the answer turns out to be @xmath59 , the noise completely flavor - depolarizes the neutrino state and the true answer is @xmath60 .",
    "given the significant uncertainties in the explosion model , the problem may not warrant anything more elaborate .",

    "by continuity , depolarization must be present even before the density reaches its resonant value .. ] let us estimate at what point the depolarization effect becomes significant .",
    "one way is to model the post - shock profile as a constant density region of extent @xmath119 cm . using eq .",

    "we see that for @xmath131 significant ( @xmath132 ) depolarization occurs already at @xmath133 sec .    to check the robustness of this result to the details of the profile",

    "let us briefly list the experimental implications of our findings .",
    "\\(1 ) when the densities in the turbulence reach @xmath138 g/@xmath8 , assuming @xmath139 , the @xmath10-resonance should become completely flavor - depolarized .",
    "this manifests itself in a characteristic dip of the average energy in the detector , or changing rate of the high - energy events .",
    "this is qualitatively ( but not quantitatively ) similar to what has been discussed in connection with the passage of the front shock @xcite .",
    "just like in that case , the signature appears either in neutrinos or antineutrinos , depending on the sign of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "an observation of the effect would thus determine the sign of the mass hierarchy and place a lower bound on @xmath140 .",
    "\\(2 ) the onset of the depolarization would be gradual , with the off - resonance effects possibly present up to a second earlier .",
    "this may be used to distinguish turbulence from the shock effects , as the latter are more abrupt .",
    "the effect may be even more pronounced for the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "\\(3 ) the depolarization _ replaces _ the signatures of the front shock and other features in the density range covered by the turbulence .",
    "indeed , flavor - depolarized neutrino is described by a density matrix @xmath141 , which commutes with any hamiltonian and carries no information about density features either before or after the turbulence .",
    "this extends to the earth effect when the @xmath13 resonance also becomes depolarized , providing yet another possible way to distinguish turbulence from other effects at future large detectors .",
    "the observation about the loss of sensitivity to the front shock was also made in an interesting recent paper @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite considers an _ ad - hoc _ @xmath17-correlated noise , following @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) the density profile varies between models and , moreover , even within a given model @xcite varies significantly depending on the direction to the observer .",
    "consequently , there is no unique prediction for when exactly the depolarization effects appear first .",
