    "in his recent papers georgi @xcite has proposed a new scenario . in his proposal",
    "new physics contains both standard model ( sm ) fields and a scale invariant sector described by banks - zaks ( bz ) fields @xcite .",
    "the two sectors interact via the exchange of particles with a mass scale @xmath6 . below this large mass scale interactions between sm fields and bz fields",
    "are described by non - renormalizable couplings suppressed by powers of @xmath6 @xcite :    @xmath7    the renormalization effects in the scale invariant bz sector then produce dimensional transmutation at an energy scale @xmath8 @xcite . in the effective theory below the scale @xmath8 ,",
    "the bz operators are embedded as unparticle operators .",
    "the operator ( 1 ) is now matched to the following form ,    @xmath9    here , @xmath10 is the scale dimension of the unparticle operator @xmath11 and the constant @xmath12 is a coefficient function .",
    "if unparticles exist , their phenomenological implications should be discussed . in the literature",
    ", there have been many discussions which investigate various features of unparticle physics @xcite . in",
    "the some of these researches several unparticle production processes have been studied .",
    "possible evidence for this scale invariant sector might be the signature of a missing energy .",
    "it can be tested experimentally by examining missing energy distributions .",
    "other evidence for unparticles can be explored by studying its virtual effects . imposing scale invariance ,",
    "the spin-1 unparticle propagator is given by @xcite :    @xmath13    where ,    @xmath14    in this work we investigate virtual unparticle effects through moller scattering .",
    "we consider the following effective interaction terms , first proposed by georgi@xcite :    @xmath15",

    "the behavior of the total cross section as a function of the center of mass energy of the @xmath24 system for @xmath25 is shown in fig.[fig2]-[fig5 ] . in the figures we investigate the influence of the scale dimension @xmath10 on the deviations of the total cross sections from their sm value for @xmath26 tev and @xmath27 tev .",
    "we omit a plot of the cross section for @xmath28 since it is very close to the sm .",
    "one can see from these figures that the deviations of the cross sections grow as the energy increases .    in fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig4 ] we investigate the sensitivity of the cross section to the vector coupling @xmath1 .",
    "so we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "similarly in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig5 ] we investigate the axial vector coupling @xmath2 .",
    "we see from these figures that the cross section is more sensitive to @xmath1 than @xmath2 . for instance , in fig[fig3 ] the cross section for @xmath31 at @xmath32=400 gev increases by a factor of 3.0 when we compare with its sm value . on the other hand in fig.[fig2 ] this increment is a factor of 3.8 for the same scale dimension @xmath31 .",
    "we also see from fig.[fig2]-[fig5 ] that the deviation of the cross section from its sm value increases with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "this is reasonable since the @xmath10 dependent coefficient @xmath33 is inversely proportional to the @xmath34th power of the energy scale @xmath8 ( 17 ) .",
    "therefore the contribution that comes from the unparticle couplings drastically grow as the @xmath10 decreases . to be precise for @xmath35 , @xmath36 grows with a factor of 4000 as @xmath10 decreases from 1.7 to 1.1 .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the unparticle couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 requires statistical analysis . to this purpose",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 c.l . limits on @xmath1 and @xmath2 using a simple @xmath37 analysis at @xmath38=100 , 300 , 500 gev and integrated luminosity @xmath39=50 and 500 @xmath40 without systematic errors .",
    "the @xmath37 function is given by ,        the limits for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given in tables [ tab1]-[tab4 ] .",
    "one can see from these tables that the lower and upper bounds on the unparticle couplings are symmetric .",
    "the decrease in @xmath10 highly improves the sensitivity limits .",
    "the most sensitive results are obtained at @xmath44 .",
    "this value of the scale dimension improves the sensitivity limits of @xmath1 by a factor of 6 - 16 depending on the energy when we compare with @xmath45 for @xmath39=50 @xmath40 .",
    "this improvement is a factor of 6 - 14 for the limits of @xmath2 , depending on the energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the sensitivity limits are interesting .",
    "as we have discussed in the previous section the deviation of the cross sections grow as the energy increases . on the other hand the sm cross section and therefore the number of events decreases with the energy .",
    "therefore it is very difficult to predict the behavior of the limits without an explicit calculation .",
    "explicit results are given in the tables .",
    "we see from the tables that the limits for the parameter @xmath1 are more sensitive than @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the sensitivity limit of @xmath1 for @xmath44 is 1.7 times restricted compared to @xmath2 at @xmath39=50 @xmath40 .",
    "this factor is 1.75 at @xmath39=500 @xmath40 .",
