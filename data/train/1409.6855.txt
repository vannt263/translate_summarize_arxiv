    "existence of such examples in higher dimensions follows from @xmath6-dimensional case . in spite of topological nature of the task ,",
    "the proof is purely discrete geometrical : it relies on metric and coloring properties of planar graphs .",
    "thus we tried to separate the discussion of established facts in toric topology which motivated this study , from the proof of the main theorem to keep things comprehensible for the broad audience .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secttopology ]",
    "we briefly review the necessary topological objects , and describe the standard combinatorial and geometrical models which are used to classify them .",
    "the objects are : quasitoric manifolds , symplectic toric manifolds , and toric origami manifolds .",
    "the corresponding combinatorial models are : characteristic pairs , delzant polytopes , and origami templates respectively . in section  [ sectweightedspheres ]",
    "we introduce the notion of a weighted simplicial cell sphere , which , in a certain sense , unifies all these combinatorial models . we define a connected sum of weighted spheres along vertices .",

    "this gives a simplicial sphere @xmath271 with at least @xmath418 vertices and the same lipschitz constants as @xmath419 .",
    "thus @xmath420 .",
    "now take the dual simple polytope @xmath41 of @xmath271 , consider any proper coloring of facets in four colors and assign a characteristic function @xmath38 , as described in lemma  [ lemfourcolor ] .",

    "of course , all our estimations are very rough , and , probably , there are better ways to construct fat spheres . for sure",
    ", there exist @xmath59-spheres of fatness @xmath421 with less than @xmath418 vertices .",
    "note that in dimension @xmath313 and higher there is no simplicial subdivision of a regular simplex into smaller regular simplices .",
    "this is one of two places in the proof , where the dimension restriction is crucial .",
    "the second place is the four color theorem in lemma  [ lemfourcolor ] .",

    "now we need to make the remaining cases @xmath422 .",

    "let @xmath52 be any quasitoric manifold , which is not toric origami .",
    "take the product of @xmath52 with @xmath423 ( the circle @xmath424 acts on @xmath423 by axial rotations ) . on the level of orbit spaces , this corresponds to multiplying @xmath41 with a closed interval @xmath425 .",
    "we claim that quasitoric manifold @xmath426 is not toric origami .",
    "if @xmath426 were a toric origami manifold , then all its characteristic submanifolds should be toric origami as well ( see construction  [ conorbitoforigami ] ) .",
    "but @xmath52 is one of them .",
    "this gives a contradiction .",
    "thus taking products with @xmath423 produces examples for all @xmath422 .",
    "sphere @xmath423 is the simplest example of a quasitoric manifold . in the proof of proposition  [ propexisthighdim ]",
    "we could have used any other quasitoric manifold instead of @xmath423 . if @xmath52 and @xmath427 are quasitoric manifolds and one of them is not toric origami , then the quasitoric manifold @xmath428 is not toric origami as well .    on the other hand ,",
    "new toric origami manifolds can be produced from a given one in a similar way as we used for constructing non - examples .",
    "it is easy to observe that if @xmath3 is a toric origami manifold and @xmath429 is a toric symplectic manifold , then @xmath430 is again a toric origami manifold .",
    "we would also like to mention that projective bundles over toric origami manifolds are again toric origami manifolds .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath12 is toric origami , and @xmath431 are complex line bundles over @xmath3 , each having an @xmath69 action on fibers , then the projectivization @xmath432 with the induced action of @xmath433 is also a toric origami manifold .",
    "we already mentioned a relation of our study to the theory of planar separators in section  [ sectproof ] .",
    "we also want to mention another connection to the theory of random infinite planar maps .",
    "this rapidly developing part of probability theory aims , among other things , to give a firm foundation for some facts in statistical physics and quantum gravity .",
    "the basic idea of this study is the following  @xcite .",
    "fix a number @xmath191 , a parameter of the whole construction . for",
    "a given @xmath7 consider all possible ( rooted ) plane @xmath191-angulations with @xmath7 faces .",
    "for @xmath434 , these are roughly the same as simplicial spheres .",
    "every plane graph has a standard metric , turning it into a metric space . by letting the number of faces tend to infinity , and renormalizing the diameter of graphs in a correct way",
    ", one considers the limits of converging sequences of graphs .",
    "the limits are taken with respect to the gromov ",
    "hausdorff metric defined on the set of isometry classes of metric spaces .",
    "since there is only a finite number of such graphs with a fixed number @xmath7 of faces , we can take a uniform distribution on this set of graphs .",
    "the uniform distributions on the sets of prelimit metric spaces give rise to a limiting distribution , which is viewed as a random compact metric space ( of course , here we omit a lot of technicalities , needed to state everything precisely ) .",
    "the resulting random metric space is called a brownian map and considered as a good @xmath59-dimensional analogue of the brownian motion .",
    "a wonderful thing is that a brownian map does not actually depend on the parameter @xmath191 , if @xmath191 is either @xmath313 or even  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the brownian map is almost surely homeomorphic to a @xmath59-sphere  @xcite .",
    "this suggests the following    for each @xmath323 almost all simplicial @xmath59-spheres @xmath271 have @xmath324 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath435 denotes the set of all simplicial @xmath59-spheres with @xmath436 triangles , and @xmath437 the subset of simplicial spheres having @xmath324 , then @xmath438    the reason is as follows ( cf .",
    "* cor.5.3 ) ) .",
    "if there were a lot of `` thin '' simplicial spheres , they all would have bottlenecks  small cycles , dividing them into macroscopic regions .",
    "after taking a limit as @xmath439 and rescaling the metric , these bottlenecks would collapse to points .",
    "thus the limiting metric space would be non - homeomorphic to a sphere with non - zero probability .",
    "this question is motivated by the following fact .",
    "there exist a simple 3-polytope @xmath41 such that any quasitoric manifold @xmath52 over @xmath41 is not equivariantly homeomorphic to a symplectic toric manifold . stating shortly",
    ": there exist combinatorial types of simple 3-polytopes which do not admit delzant realizations .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that any 3-dimensional delzant polytope has at least one triangular or quadrangular face .",
    "consequently , in particular , a dodecahedron does not admit a delzant realization .",
    "an origami template is a generalization of a single delzant polytope , thus a realizability of a given combinatorial polytope by an origami template is a more complicated task .",
    "problem  [ problcombrestr ] can be restated in different terms : are there any combinatorial restrictions on the orbit spaces of toric origami manifolds ?",
    "the examples of non - origami quasitoric manifolds in high dimensions were constructed from the @xmath313-dimensional case . on the other hand",
    ", lemma  [ lembigfatsmalcol ] applies for any dimension .",
    "the problem of finding higher - dimensional polytopes whose dual spheres have large fatness may be of independent interest .    actually , even if we find such a fat sphere , to make use of the developed technique we should also construct a characteristic function with a small range of values .",
    "this constitutes a certain problem , since characteristic function may not even exist , if @xmath440 ( this happens for dual neighborly polytopes , see  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a big class of simplicial @xmath272-spheres , so called balanced spheres , which admit a proper vertex - coloring in @xmath7 colors .",
    "such colorings give rise to characteristic functions , which have exactly @xmath7 values , i.e. minimal possible .",
    "such characteristic functions and the corresponding quasitoric manifolds were called linear models in  @xcite . passing to a barycentric subdivision",
    "makes every simplicial sphere into a balanced sphere .",
    "we suppose that passing to a barycentric subdivision does not strongly affect the fatness .",
    "if so , given any fat sphere dual to a simple polytope , one can pass to its barycentric subdivision , provide it with a linear model characteristic function , and finally obtain a quasitoric manifold which is not toric origami .",
    "another problem , which naturally arises from lemma  [ lembigfatsmalcol ] is to find , for a given polytope @xmath41 , a characteristic function @xmath38 with the minimal possible range of values @xmath441 , if at least one characteristic function is known to exist .",
    "this minimal number seems to be an analogue of buchstaber invariant ( see the definition in @xcite or @xcite ) , as was noted to us recently by n.erokhovets .",
    "it may happen that an interesting theory hides beyond this subject .",
    "there exist obstructions to origami realizability , other than those described in section  [ sectproof ] . if a weighted simplicial sphere @xmath271 can be represented as a connected sum , along a tree , of simplicial spheres dual to delzant polytopes , this does not mean automatically that @xmath271 corresponds to an origami template .",
    "the reason is that a convex polytope contains more information than its normal fan ( or , in our terminology , dual weighted simplicial sphere )",
    ". it can be impossible to assemble an origami template from a collection of delzant polytopes , even if their dual weighted spheres suit together well .",
    "any projective toric variety corresponds to a convex polytope .",
    "thus any smooth projective toric variety is a symplectic toric manifold , which is a particular case of toric origami .",
    "thus , to prove the conjecture , one should consider non - projective examples .",
    "translating the problem into combinatorial language , the task is to find a complete smooth fan , which is not a normal fan of any polytope and , moreover , not dual to any origami template .",
    "the simplest non - polytopal fan is the fan corresponding to a famous non - projective oda s",
    "3-fold  @xcite .",
    "so it is natural to start with a more concrete question :          in section  [ secttopology ] we mentioned that a toric origami manifold @xmath137 is not quasitoric if its template graph has cycles .",
    "even if the orbit space of @xmath137 is contractible , the manifold @xmath137 may not be quasitoric .",
    "the simplest example of this kind is the sphere @xmath150 ( example  [ exsfour ] ) .",
    "the orbit space of @xmath150 is a 2-gon , shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : orbitspace ] , which is not a convex polytope .",
    "excluding situations of these two kinds we may ask the following question ."
