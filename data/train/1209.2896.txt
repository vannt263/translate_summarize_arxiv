    "let @xmath3 be a group . for @xmath4 , let @xmath5 denote the number of isomorphism classes of @xmath6-dimensional irreducible complex representations of  @xmath3 . we suppose that @xmath3 is _ representation rigid _",
    ", i.e. , that @xmath7 for all positive integers  @xmath6 .",
    "if the group @xmath3 is finite then @xmath3 is automatically representation rigid and the sequence @xmath5 has only finitely many non - zero terms , capturing the distribution of irreducible character degrees of  @xmath3 .",
    "the study of finite groups by means of their irreducible character degrees and conjugacy classes is a well established research area ; e.g. , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "interesting asymptotic phenomena are known to occur when one considers the irreducible character degrees of suitable infinite families of finite groups , for instance , families of finite groups @xmath8 of lie type as @xmath9 tends to infinity ; see  @xcite .",
    "in the present survey we are primarily interested in the situation where @xmath3 is infinite , albeit @xmath3 may sometimes arise as an inverse limit of finite groups .",
    "two fundamental questions in this case are : what are the arithmetic properties of the sequence @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and what is the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath11 as @xmath12 tends to infinity ?",
    "to a certain degree this line of investigation is inspired by the subject of subgroup growth and subgroup zeta functions which , in a similar way , is concerned with the distribution of finite index subgroups ; e.g. , see @xcite .    in order to streamline the investigation it is convenient to encode the arithmetic sequence @xmath5 , @xmath13 , in a suitable generating function .",
    "the _ representation zeta function _ of @xmath3 is the dirichlet generating function @xmath14 if the group @xmath3 is such that there is a one - to - one correspondence between isomorphism classes of irreducible representations and irreducible characters then , writing @xmath15 for the space of irreducible characters of @xmath3 , we can express the zeta function also in the suggestive and slightly more algebraic form @xmath16    the function @xmath17 is a suitable vehicle for studying the distribution of character degrees of the group  @xmath3 whenever the representation growth of @xmath3 is ` not too fast ' , a condition which is made precise in section  [ sec : abscissa ] .",
    "groups which meet this requirement include , for instance , arithmetic groups in semisimple algebraic groups with the congruence subgroup property and open compact subgroups of semisimple @xmath18-adic lie groups . in recent years",
    ", several substantial results have been obtained concerning the representation growth and representation zeta functions of these types of groups ; see  @xcite . in the present survey we discuss some of these results and we indicate what kinds of methods are involved in proving them .",
    "our primary focus is on infinite groups , but it is instructive to briefly touch upon representation zeta functions of finite groups of lie type . for example , the representation theory of the general linear group @xmath19 over a finite field @xmath20 is well understood and one deduces readily that @xmath21 it is remarkable that the formula is uniform in @xmath22 in the sense that both the irreducible character degrees and their multiplicities can be expressed in terms of polynomials in @xmath22 over the rational field  @xmath23 . in general , deligne - lusztig theory provides powerful and sophisticated tools to study the irreducible characters of finite groups of lie type . in  @xcite , liebeck and shalev",
    "obtained , for instance , the following general asymptotic result .",
    "[ thm : finite - lie - type ] let @xmath24 be a fixed lie type and let @xmath25 be the coxeter number of the corresponding simple algebraic group @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "then for the finite quasi - simple groups @xmath28 of type @xmath24 over @xmath20 , @xmath29    the coxeter number @xmath25 is computed easily .",
    "for example , for @xmath30 and @xmath31 one has @xmath32 . in the smallest interesting case @xmath33 and for odd",
    "@xmath22 , the zeta function of @xmath34 is @xmath35 which is approximately the expression in   divided by @xmath36 . from the explicit formula one can verify directly the assertion of theorem  [ thm : finite - lie - type ] in this special case",
    "in section  [ sec : intro ] we introduced the zeta function @xmath17 of a representation rigid group @xmath3 as a formal dirichlet series . clearly , if @xmath3 is finite  or more generally if @xmath3 has only finitely many irreducible complex representations  then the dirichlet polynomial @xmath17 defines an analytic function on the entire complex plane .    now suppose that @xmath3 is infinite and that @xmath5 is non - zero for infinitely many @xmath13 .",
    "naturally , we are interested in the convergence properties of @xmath17 for @xmath37 .",
    "the general theory of dirichlet generating functions shows that the region of convergence is always a right half plane of @xmath38 , possibly empty , and that the resulting function is analytic .",
    "if the region of convergence is non - empty , one is also interested in meromorphic continuation of the function to a larger part of the complex plane .",
    "the _ abscissa of convergence _",
    "@xmath39 of @xmath17 is the infimum of all @xmath40 such that the series @xmath17 converges ( to an analytic function ) on the right half plane @xmath41 .",
    "the abscissa @xmath39 is finite if and only if @xmath3 has _",
    "polynomial representation growth _ , i.e. , if @xmath42 grows at most polynomially in  @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , if the growth sequence @xmath43 , @xmath44 , is unbounded then @xmath45 gives the _ polynomial degree of growth _ : @xmath46 for every @xmath47 .",
    "two fundamental problems in the subject are : to characterise groups of polynomial representation growth  motivated by gromow s celebrated theorem on groups of polynomial word growth  and to link the actual value of the abscissa of convergence @xmath39 of a group @xmath3 to structural properties of @xmath3 . in general these questions are still very much open . however , in the context of semisimple algebraic groups and their arithmetic subgroups a range of results have been obtained . a selection of these",
    "are discussed in the following sections .",
    "in @xcite , witten initiated in the context of quantum gauge theories the study of certain representation zeta functions .",
    "let @xmath26 be a connected , simply connected , complex almost simple algebraic group and let @xmath48 .",
    "it is natural to focus on rational representations of the algebraic group @xmath3 and one can show that @xmath3 is representation rigid in this restricted sense .",
    "the _ witten zeta function _",
    "@xmath17 counts irreducible rational representations of the complex algebraic group @xmath3 .",
    "these zeta functions also appear naturally as archimedean factors of representation zeta functions of arithmetic groups , as explained in section  [ sec : lattices ] .",
    "for example , the group @xmath49 has a unique irreducible representation of each possible degree .",
    "hence @xmath50 the famous riemann zeta function .",
    "in particular , the abscissa of convergence is  @xmath2 and there is a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane",
    ".    in general , the irreducible representations @xmath51 of @xmath3 are parametrised by their highest weights @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ,  , @xmath54 denote the fundamental weights and the coefficients @xmath55 range over all non - negative integers .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 is given by the weyl dimension formula . by a careful analysis ,",
    "larsen and lubotzky prove in @xcite the following result .",
    "[ thm : witten ] let @xmath26 be a connected , simply connected , complex almost simple algebraic group and let @xmath48",
    ". then @xmath57 , where @xmath25 is the coxeter number of @xmath26 .",
    "it is known that witten zeta functions can be continued meromorphically to the entire complex plane .",
    "further analytic properties of these functions , such as the location of singularities and functional relations , have been investigated in some detail using multiple zeta functions ; e.g. , see  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the same invariant @xmath58 features in theorems  [ thm : finite - lie - type ] and [ thm : witten ] .",
    "currently there appears to be no conceptual explanation for this .",
    "if @xmath3 is a topological group it is natural to focus attention on continuous representations . a finitely generated profinite group @xmath3 is representation rigid in this restricted sense if and only if it is _ fab _ , i.e. , if every open subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath3 has finite abelianisation  @xmath61 $ ]",
    "this is a consequence of jordan s theorem on abelian normal subgroups of bounded index in finite linear groups .",
    "we tacitly agree that the representation zeta function @xmath17 of a finitely generated fab profinite group @xmath3 counts irreducible continuous complex representations of  @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a complete discrete valuation ring , with residue field @xmath20 of odd characteristic .",
    "this means that @xmath60 is either a finite integral extension of the ring of @xmath18-adic integers @xmath62 for some prime @xmath18 or a formal power series ring @xmath63\\!]$ ] over a finite field of cardinality  @xmath22 .    in  @xcite ,",
    "jaikin - zapirain showed by a hands - on computation of character degrees that the representation zeta function @xmath64 equals @xmath65 where the dirichlet polynomial @xmath66 is described in .",
    "it is remarkable that the above formula is uniform in @xmath22 , irrespective of the characteristic , absolute ramification index or isomorphism type of the ring  @xmath60 . in the case where @xmath60 has characteristic @xmath67 , lie - theoretic techniques combined with clifford theory",
    "can be used to gain an insight into the features of this specific example which hold more generally ; see sections  [ sec : fab ] and [ sec : akov ] .",
    "clearly , the explicit formula for the function @xmath64 provides a meromorphic extension to the entire complex plane .",
    "the abscissa of convergence is @xmath2 and , in view of theorems  [ thm : finite - lie - type ] and [ thm : witten ] , this value could be interpreted as @xmath58 , the coxeter number of @xmath68 being @xmath69 .",
    "but such an interpretation is misleading , as can be seen from the following general result obtained in  @xcite .",
    "[ thm : isotropic ] let @xmath26 be a simple algebraic group over a non - archimedean local field  @xmath70 .",

    ". then @xmath73 .",
    "taking @xmath30 and @xmath74 , we may consider the compact @xmath18-adic lie groups @xmath75 .",
    "for these groups @xmath76 as @xmath77 , whereas @xmath78 is uniformly bounded away from @xmath67 . currently , the only explicit values known for @xmath78 are : @xmath2 for @xmath33 ( as seen above ) , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , these do not yet indicate the general behaviour .",
    "let @xmath3 be a compact @xmath18-adic lie group . then",
    "one associates to @xmath3 a @xmath81-lie algebra as follows .",
    "the group @xmath3 contains a uniformly powerful open pro-@xmath18 subgroup @xmath82 . by the theory of powerful pro-@xmath18 groups , @xmath82 gives rise to a @xmath62-lie lattice @xmath83 and the induced @xmath81-lie algebra @xmath84",
    "does not depend on the specific choice of @xmath82 .",
    "it is a fact that @xmath3 is fab if and only if @xmath85 is perfect , i.e. , if @xmath86 = \\mathcal{l}(g)$ ] .",
    "conversely , for any @xmath81-lie algebra @xmath87 one can easily produce compact @xmath18-adic lie groups @xmath3 such that @xmath88 , using the exponential map .",
    "this supplies a large class of compact @xmath18-adic lie groups which are fab and hence have polynomial representation growth .    using the kirillov orbit method and techniques from model theory , jaikin - zapirain established in @xcite that the representation zeta function of a fab compact @xmath18-adic analytic pro-@xmath18 group can always be expressed as a rational function in @xmath89 over @xmath23 .",
    "more generally , he proved the following result , which is illustrated by the explicit example @xmath90 given in section  [ sec : sl2 ] .",

    "the invariant @xmath39 is the largest real part of a pole of @xmath17 .",
    "it is natural to investigate the whole spectrum of poles and zeros of @xmath17 .",
    "currently , very little is known about the location of the zeros of representation zeta functions . in 2010",
    "kurokawa and kurokawa observed from the explicit formula given in section  [ sec : sl2 ] that @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "we note that if @xmath3 is a finite group then @xmath97 . based on this fact and the results in @xcite one can prove the following general result .",

    "before considering arithmetic subgroups of semisimple algebraic groups , let us look at representations of the simplest infinite group , i.e. , the infinite cyclic group @xmath100 .",
    "the group @xmath100 has already infinitely many @xmath2-dimensional representations . hence in order to say anything meaningful we need to slightly adapt our basic definitions .",
    "we make two modifications : firstly let us only consider representations with finite image and secondly let us consider irreducible representations over @xmath23 rather than @xmath38 .",
    "more precisely , for any finitely generated nilpotent group @xmath101 let @xmath102 denote the number of @xmath6-dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath101 over @xmath23 with finite image .",

    "@xmath106 where for each prime @xmath18 the local factor @xmath107 , enumerating irreducible representations of @xmath18-power dimension , can be re - interpreted as the @xmath23-rational representation zeta function of the pro-@xmath18 completion @xmath108 of @xmath101 . for more details and deeper results in this direction",
    "we refer to the forthcoming article  @xcite .",
    "let us now return to the simplest case : @xmath109 , the infinite cyclic group .",
    "since the group @xmath100 is abelian , its irreducible representations over @xmath23 with finite image can be effectively described by means of galois orbits of irreducible complex characters . in the general",
    "setting , one would also need to keep track of schur indices featuring in the computation of @xmath110 .",
    "a short analysis yields @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes euler s function familiar from elementary number theory .",
    "the dirichlet series @xmath113 is of independent interest in analytic number theory and has been studied by many authors ; e.g. , see @xcite . the euler product decomposition can be established directly @xmath114 the abscissa of convergence of @xmath115 , which can be interpreted as the degree @xmath116 of @xmath23-rational representation growth , is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , writing @xmath117 one sees that @xmath115 admits a meromorphic continuation to @xmath118 ( but not to the entire complex plane ) and has a simple pole at @xmath119 with residue @xmath120 this yields very precise asymptotics for the @xmath23-rational representation growth of @xmath100 ; in particular , @xmath121 one may regard this simple case and its beautiful connections to classical analytic number theory as a further motivation for studying representation zeta functions of arithmetic groups .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to lattices in semisimple locally compact groups .",
