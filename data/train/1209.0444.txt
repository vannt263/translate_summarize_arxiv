    "switched systems @xcite are an important subclass of hybrid systems for which the system dynamics are selected among a countable family of subsystems .",
    "they are very powerful modeling tools for several real world processes , like congestion modeling and control in networks @xcite , switching control laws @xcite , electromechanical systems @xcite , networked control systems @xcite , electrical devices / circuits @xcite , etc .",
    "these systems exhibit interesting behaviors motivating their analysis : for instance , switching between asymptotically stable subsystems does not always result in an overall stable system @xcite .",
    "conversely , switching between unstable subsystems may result in asymptotically stable trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in the case of asymptotically stable linear subsystems , when their matrices commute or can be expressed in an upper triangular form via a common similarity transformation , stability of the overall switched system under arbitrary switching is actually equivalent to the existence of a quadratic common lyapunov function @xcite . in all the other cases ,",
    "the existence of a quadratic common lyapunov function is only sufficient , albeit the existence of a common ( not necessarily quadratic ) lyapunov function is necessary . when no common lyapunov function exists , approaches based for instance on polyhedral lyapunov functions @xcite or switched lyapunov functions @xcite , may be considered instead .",
    "the main difficulty arising from the use of switched lyapunov functions lies in the discontinuities of the lyapunov function level at switching instants .",
    "if switchings occur too often , stability may indeed be lost . when considering switchings among a family of asymptotically stable subsystems ,",
    "an important notion is the notion of minimum dwell - time , which is the minimal time between two successive switchings @xcite such that any switching rule satisfying this minimal - dwell time condition makes the overall system asymptotically stable .",
    "this notion has been later relaxed in @xcite via the introduction of the average dwell - time .",
    "several recent results have characterized dwell - times as semidefinite programming problems ( lmis ) by using quadratic and homogeneous lyapunov functions @xcite .    in these latter results , the minimum dwell - time computation can be performed through a mix of continuous - time and discrete - time stability conditions , reflecting then the hybrid structure of the system .",
    "the continuous - time condition accounts for the asymptotic stability of the subsystems while the discrete - time condition ensures that the lyapunov function has sufficiently decreased between switching instants so that a positive jump of the lyapunov function level can be tolerated .",
    "the results reported in @xcite have led to dramatic improvements in terms of accuracy compared to initial minimal dwell - time @xcite and average dwell - time @xcite results .",
    "this efficiency emphasizes the importance of considering discrete - time and mixed stability criteria for analyzing switched systems , and motivates their extension to uncertain systems .",
    "the main drawback in this type of criteria is the presence of exponential terms which make the extension to uncertain systems a difficult task .",
    "there is indeed , at this time , no efficient way for dealing with matrix uncertainties at the exponential .",
    "a second drawback is their limited application to switched linear systems .",
    "the notions of stability under minimum @xcite and mode - dependent @xcite dwell - times are considered in this paper . concerning minimum dwell - time ,",
    "the ideas of @xcite are continued while results on mode - dependent dwell - times are directly inspired from results on discrete - time switched systems @xcite .",
    "conditions for stability with minimal and mode - dependent dwell - times are derived using a new technique initially developed for sampled - data systems @xcite and later extended to impulsive systems @xcite .",
    "it has indeed been proved in @xcite that discrete - time stability is equivalent to a very particular type of continuous - time stability , showing thus that any discrete - time stability criterion always has a continuous - time interpretation , in terms of the use of specific functionals referred to as _ looped - functionals_. the main interest of the alternative continuous - time formulation lies in its affine dependence on the system matrices that can be exploited to derive results for uncertain systems quite easily .",
    "based on this approach , conditions for minimal and mode - dependent dwell - times characterization of uncertain switched systems are obtained .",
    "the derived criteria are expressed as infinite - dimensional convex feasibility problems that are solved using polynomial techniques @xcite . as a byproduct ,",
    "the approach is also valid in the case of linear switched systems with uncertain time - varying parameters .",
    "_ outline : _ the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : prel ] preliminary definitions and results are recalled . in sections",
    "[ sec : aff ] and [ sec : modedep ] , affine conditions for the characterization of minimum dwell - time and mode - dependent dwell - time are stated .",
    "the results are then finally extended to the uncertain case in section [ sec : unc ] .",
    "examples are considered in the related sections . _",
    "notations : _ the sets of symmetric and positive definite matrices of dimension @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . given two symmetric real matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 means that @xmath5 is positive ( semi)definite .",
    "the set of positive real numbers is @xmath6 .",
    "for a square real matrix @xmath7 , the operator @xmath8 stands for the sum @xmath9 .",
    "the identity matrix and zero - matrix of size @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . for some square matrix @xmath12",
    ", we denote by @xmath13 the block - diagonal matrix @xmath14 .",
    "linear switched systems of the form @xmath15 are considered in this paper .",
    "above , @xmath16 are the state of the system and the initial condition , respectively . in sections",
    "[ sec : aff ] and [ sec : modedep ] , the matrices @xmath17 are assumed to be exactly known , while in section [ sec : unc ] uncertain convex sets @xmath18 of matrices are considered .",
    "the switching signal @xmath19 is defined as a piecewise constant function @xmath20 .",
    "we also assume that the strictly increasing sequence of switching instants @xmath21 is state - independent , that is the mode changes are viewed as external events .",
    "the sequence is also assumed to admit no accumulation point , i.e. @xmath22 as @xmath23 . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider the following family of switching rules @xmath24 that satisfy a minimum dwell - time condition .",
    "an upper - bound on the minimum dwell - time can be determined using the following result :    [ th : geromel ] assume that for some @xmath25 , there exist matrices @xmath26 , @xmath27 such that the lmis @xmath28 and @xmath29 hold .",
    "then , for any sequence of switching instants in @xmath30 , the equilibrium solution @xmath31 of system ( [ eq : mainsyst ] ) is globally asymptotically stable.@xmath32    this result is easy to interpret . to this aim ,",
    "let us consider the lyapunov function @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "in such a case , the continuous - time lmis ( [ eq : ctlmis ] ) ensure that all the subsystems are asymptotically stable and that the lyapunov function decreases between switching instants .",
    "the discrete - time conditions ( [ eq : exp ] ) capture the jumps of the lyapunov function at switching instants .",
    "positive jumps are tolerated provided that the lyapunov function has sufficiently decreased during the latest continuous - time regime , or equivalently , provided that @xmath25 is sufficiently large .",
    "note that conditions ( [ eq : exp ] ) characterize first the continuous - time evolution in mode @xmath36 , and then the discrete transition @xmath37 .",
    "it is also possible to consider the other way around , that is the transition @xmath38 first , and then the continuous - time evolution in mode @xmath36 .",
    "in such a case , the following dual discrete - time condition should be considered @xmath39 instead of condition ( [ eq : exp ] ) in theorem [ th : geromel ] .",
    "the two criteria are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] where we can see that despite being non - monotonic , the switched - lyapunov function is able to capture information on the asymptotic stability of the system .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that theorem [ th : geromel ] is more accurate than the initial results on minimum dwell - time @xcite and average dwell - time @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates the extension of theorem [ th : geromel ] to the uncertain system case in section [ sec : unc ] .",
    "assume now that the system remains in mode @xmath36 during a period @xmath40 included in the range @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we then have the following result :    [ th : second ] assume there exist matrices @xmath26 , @xmath27 , such that the lmis @xmath44 hold for all @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "then , the system with mode - dependent dwell - time @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath35 is globally asymptotically stable .",
    "the proof is a simple adaptation of the discrete - time stability condition for switched discrete - time systems @xcite .",
    "note , however , the permutation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 compared to the usual result .",
    "this can be performed according to the discussion on theorem [ th : geromel ] in the previous section .    in the above result , the dwell - times lie within a certain range of values .",
    "it is however possible to have the upper - bound @xmath47 for certain modes by slightly modifying the conditions .",
    "this is explained in the remark below .",
    "[ rem:1 ] when @xmath47 for some indices @xmath36 , it is then necessary that subsystem @xmath36 be stable , in a similar way as in minimum dwell - time results . in this case ,",
    "inequality ( [ eq : djsqod ] ) considered at @xmath48 can be substituted by @xmath49 .",
    "the stability conditions for subsystem @xmath36 then become @xmath50 and @xmath51 a proof for this statement is similar to the one of theorem [ th : geromel ] and is thus omitted .",
    "it is important to mention that the provided approach for mode - dependent dwell - time is radically different from the standard approaches , such as the one in @xcite . in the current approach",
    ", a discrete - time condition is used to explicitly characterize a range of values for the dwell - times , while in most of the approaches continuous - time conditions are considered . additionally , the proposed approach does not require stability of all the subsystems , and is thus applicable to a wider class of switched systems .",
    "the price to pay is the difficulty for extending the results to uncertain systems , a problem which is resolved by the proposed approach relying on looped - functionals .",
    "the main drawback of theorem [ th : geromel ] lies in the presence of exponentials in the conditions ( [ eq : exp ] ) which make the extension to uncertain systems very difficult since there is no efficient way for considering matrix uncertainties at the exponential . to overcome this difficulty , an alternative condition for theorem [ th : geromel ] that is affine in the system matrices",
    "is provided in this section .",
    "it is also emphasized that this novel condition can be interpreted as the non - increase condition of a certain class of looped - functional @xcite recently introduced by the authors .",
    "the following result provides sufficient conditions for theorem [ th : geromel ] .",
    "[ th : equiv ] assume there exist a scalar @xmath52 , matrices @xmath26 , @xmath27 and symmetric differentiable matrix functions @xmath53\\to\\mathbb{s}^{3n}$ ] , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , verifying @xmath56 where @xmath57 and such that the lmis @xmath58 @xmath59 hold for all @xmath60 $ ] where @xmath61 then , the switched system ( [ eq : mainsyst ] ) is asymptotically stable for any sequence of switching instants in @xmath30 and the conditions of theorem [ th : geromel ] are satisfied with the same matrices @xmath45.@xmath32    to see the implication , first pre- and post - multiply ( [ eq : expless ] ) by @xmath62\\ ] ] to obtain @xmath63\\le0.\\ ] ] integrating the above inequality from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , we get @xmath66d\\tau\\\\    & & + \\xi(\\bar{t})^{\\operatorname{\\intercal}}z_{ij}(\\bar{t})\\xi(\\bar{t})-\\xi(0)^{\\operatorname{\\intercal}}z_{ij}(0)\\xi(0)\\le0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 . noting that @xmath68 the last row of ( [ eq : eta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 which is equal to 0 by virtue of the constraint ( [ eq : loliloolldr ] ) . hence , we have @xmath70\\\\    & = & \\bar{t}\\left[v_i(x(\\bar{t}))-v_j(x(0))+\\operatorname{\\varepsilon}||x(0)||^2_2\\right ] .",

    "this then implies that ( [ eq : exp2 ] ) holds and shows that the feasibility of the conditions of theorem [ th : equiv ] implies the feasibility of those of theorem [ th : geromel ] .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "it is worth noting that condition ( [ eq : expless ] ) is infinite - dimensional since the decision variables @xmath74 s are matrix functions . in order to render the problem tractable",
    ", these functions will be assumed as polynomials and determined using sum - of - squares programming @xcite .",
    "this can be performed conveniently using the package sostools @xcite together with the semidefinite programming solver sedumi @xcite .",
    "the above result provides a sufficient condition for theorem [ th : geromel ] .",
    "the necessity of the conditions of theorem [ th : equiv ] is an open problem and examples tend to suggest that the conditions might be necessary .",
    "this question is left for future research .",
    "the following corollary concerns the case of constant inter - switching periods :    assume there exist a scalar @xmath52 , matrices @xmath75 , @xmath27 and continuously differentiable symmetric matrix functions @xmath53\\to\\mathbb{s}^{3n}$ ] , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , satisfying the constraints ( [ eq : loliloolldr ] ) and such that the lmis ( [ eq : expless ] ) hold for all @xmath76 $ ] . then , the switched system ( [ eq : mainsyst ] ) with constant switching period @xmath65 is globally asymptotically stable.@xmath32      the result of theorem [ th : equiv ] can be interpreted as a monotonic non - increase condition of the looped - functionals @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath76 $ ] and the matrix functions @xmath79 satisfy the boundary condition ( [ eq : loliloolldr ] ) .",
    "the looped - functionals ( [ eq : looped ] ) are indeed nonincreasing over @xmath80 $ ] if and only if the conditions ( [ eq : expless ] ) hold .",
    "the term ` looped ' comes from the presence of the boundary condition ( [ eq : loliloolldr ] ) that ` loops ' both sides of the functional .",
    "such functionals have been successfully applied to the analysis of sampled - data systems @xcite and impulsive systems @xcite .",
    "illustrative examples are given here .",
    "the conditions of theorem [ th : equiv ] are enforced using sum - of - squares programming @xcite and the semidefinite programming solver sedumi @xcite .",
    "thus , in the examples below , the matrix functions @xmath79 s will be searched over the ring of polynomials with fixed degree .",
    "note that polynomials can approximate continuous functions over compact set as precisely as desired by virtue of the weierstrass approximation theorem .",
    "it is thus expected to obtain more and more accurate results as the degree of the @xmath79 s increases .",
    "the rates of convergence of the computed upper bounds may however be very heterogeneous .",
    "let us consider the system ( [ eq : mainsyst ] ) with matrices @xcite @xmath81 using the initial result on minimal - dwell - time in @xcite , the upper - bound 6.66 on the minimum dwell - time is found . for comparison , the average dwell - time condition of @xcite yields the value 16.5554 as the upper - bound on the average dwell - time . using the minimum dwell - time result based on mixed continuous - time and discrete - time conditions , i.e. theorem [ th : geromel ] , the upper bound 2.7508 on the minimum dwell - time is obtained .",
    "this emphasizes the efficiency and importance of theorem [ th : geromel ] in dwell - time analysis of linear switched systems .",
    "theorem [ th : equiv ] yields the minimum dwell - time estimates summarized in table [ tab : ex123 ] .",

    "new conditions for minimal and mode - dependent dwell - times characterization for linear switched systems have been presented .",
