    "the introduction of @xmath0-parity violation @xmath20 implies the existence of lepton or baryon number violating processes , like the unobserved proton decay and neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath21 ) . in order",

    "( [ mqq])([mll ] ) contain superparticle masses and trilinear coupling constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the masses of superparticles in mssm may be generated using the renormalization group equations , with some unification conditions assumed at high energies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is important to note , that we have no information about the @xmath35 and @xmath36 couplings neither at @xmath37 nor at @xmath38 and therefore we can not use the rge procedure for them ( although the required rg equations are known ) .",
    "it follows that , after obtaining the numerical forms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the experimental data , we can put constraints on the non - standard couplings @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this idea has already been discussed in literature in various forms @xcite .",
    "all of them , however , were based on many simplifications , like the approximate treatment of squark ( slepton ) mixing , negligence of quark mixing and very simplified treatment of the mssm mass spectrum .",
    "a  problem directly related to the discussed mass formulae is the determination of the phenomenological neutrino mass matrices from the experimental data .",
    "these can be evaluated using the well - known relation @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the neutrino mass eigenvalues .",

    "one remark is in order .",
    "we have found several regions of @xmath64 for which there exist combinations of phases which give certain elements in the neutrino mass matrix equal to zero .",
    "this is an interesting observation , especially when related to the @xmath65 element , which is governing the @xmath21 decay rate .",
    "it turns out that for some sets of parameters this decay may be suppressed even for three massive majorana neutrinos .",
    "for example , our calculations suggest that @xmath66 for normal hierarchy and @xmath67 ev .    as a  consequence for the trilinear @xmath0-parity violating mechanism described in the previous section , these combinations of neutrino parameters imply either @xmath68 , or the existence of other mechanism which suppresses the amplitudes of the diagrams from fig .",
