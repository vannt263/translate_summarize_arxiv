    "physical problems described by hamiltonians composed of competing terms can display very complicated behavior , and are thus quite interesting .",
    "competition between short - range and long - range interactions are particularly interesting , and have been studied in the context of elastic long - range interactions which favor ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering . if the short - range interaction is also ferromagnetic , the critical behavior of the physical system belongs to the mean - field universality class ( miyashita 2008 , nakada 2001 ) .",
    "if the short - range order is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) the statistical mechanics of the critical behavior is much more complicated .",
    "this competition is essential to the molecular crystals known as spin - crossover materials ( miyashita 2008 , nakada 2011 , nishino 2013 ) , in which there is a volume change associated with the spin state of the molecules .",

    "the second term is a long - range interaction of the mean - field husimi - temperley form ( miyashita 2008 ) and favors fm configurations over afm ones .",
    "the third term is the normal zeeman energy and favors @xmath9 for @xmath10 . to study the antiferromagnet , it is sufficient to consider @xmath11 with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 .",

    "are all degenerate at @xmath20 for the former .",
    "such degeneracy never arises for the latter model , and this is one reason the afm ising model has more complicated behavior ( hwang 2007 ) .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath0 is much different .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",

    "the afm and fm classes are exactly degenerate .",
    "the right - most panel shows the effect of applying a field on the arrangement of the classes .",
    "clearly , this shows that depending on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 the phase transition between the afm and paramagnetic ( pm ) states can be either first order or second order .     as determined by metropolis monte carlo .",
    "the black curve with small circles at data points represents critical temperatures determined by extrapolation of cumulant crossings .",

    "below all the curves the afm configurations are minima in the free energy : global minima and absolutely stable within the curves of the phase transitions , as opposed to metastable minima between the transition lines and the spinodals . the positively oriented pm@xmath27 configuration has a free - energy minimum to the right of the pm@xmath27 spinodal ( green ) , while the negatively oriented pm@xmath28 configuration has a free energy minimum to the left of the pm@xmath28 spinodal line ( blue ) .",
    "aside from the overall temperature scale , the features of the phase diagram considered so far are similar to those for a model in which the local afm interaction term is replaced by the two - sublattice , mean - field approximation ,",
