    "zeeman coherences are also a basic ingredient of sub - doppler @xcite and sub - recoil @xcite laser cooling mechanisms .",
    "very recently an experimental and theoretical investigation of a multilevel atomic system with two optical fields have revealed a new coherent feature of electromagnetic enhanced absorption @xcite .",
    "the combined action of the two coherent optical fields produce a low frequency zeeman coherence that increases the atomic absorption .",
    "the subnatural linewidth of the resonance observed scanning the frequency difference between the two optical fields is determined by the coherence relaxation rate . in this work",
    "we investigate a closely related enhanced absorption associated to the low frequency zeeman coherence in a degenerate two level system and detected in a hanle effect configuration .    in the original hanle effect @xcite",
    ", the resonance fluorescence of an atomic sample is depolarized by an applied magnetic field as result of the destruction of the excited - state zeeman coherences . in that case",
    "the hanle resonance width is the natural linewidth of the excited state . in the case of the hanle effect in the ground state @xcite ,",
    "the width of the hanle signal is limited only by the relaxation rate of the ground state and subnatural resonances can be realized .",
    "the low - frequency coherences result also in the modification of the total fluorescence intensity , and hanle resonances of both negative and positive sign have been observed .",
    "the case of a @xmath1 transition has been extensively studied @xcite and more recent work @xcite has pointed out the strict connection between hanle effect on these transitions and coherent population trapping . for zero magnetic field",
    "the atoms are optically pumped into a nonabsorbing ( or dark ) state .",
    "an applied magnetic field destroys the nonabsorbing state and produces an absorption with a linewidth determined by the relaxation rate of the created zeeman coherence .",
    "thus the hanle effect in the ground state of an atomic system appears as a decrease in the atomic absorption , with a minimum centered at zero magnetic field and a linewidth determined by the relaxation rate of the ground state coherences .",
    "however anomalous hanle effect lineshapes may be observed under different experimental conditions .",
    "for instance , for the transition @xmath2 in neon the circulation of zeeman coherence between excited and ground states produced an inversion in the sign of the hanle effect , with an increased absorption at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the study of the hanle effect on a @xmath0 transition leads to different results depending whether the considered transition is open or closed .",
    "for the _ open _ @xmath3 transition of the sodium d@xmath4 line under resonant laser excitation , the fluorescence profile is given by a nearly lorentzian curve @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the _ closed _ @xmath5 transition of the sodium d@xmath6 line line , narrow resonances of positive sign have been observed superposed to the homogeneous broadening lorentzian profile @xcite .",
    "similar observation have been reported also by fischer and hertel @xcite , who explained the effect as a disturbance of the optical pumping process by the larmor atomic precession .",
    "those authors connected the linewidth of the fluorescence increase to the pumping time , but they did not perform a lineshape investigation . very recently experimental results of an enhanced absorption in rubidium atoms excited by diode lasers on @xmath7 transitions have been obtained by two different groups @xcite .",
    "narrow enhanced - absorption hanle effect lineshapes have been observed also for in molecules@xcite , but the mechanism of their production has not been completely defined .    in the present work we analyse the ground - state hanle effect on a closed @xmath8 transition , with the standard configuration of an applied linear - polarized laser radiation and magnetic field collinear to the laser light wavevector .",
    "we describe the peculiarities of the hanle signal for a closed atomic transition , and identify the mechanism responsible for narrow bright resonances at low laser intensities .",
    "we provide a connection with the laser cooling processes where ground state coherences play an important role .",
    "we derive the lineshape for enhanced absorption hanle effect with linewidth determined by the ground state optical pumping time .",

    "thus , in order to modify significantly the excited state populations or coherences related to the excited state , the magnetic field should be strong enough , _",

    ", the narrow features can be originated from what occurs in the ground state . in the case of a closed transition a steady state",
    "can be reached and a particularly simple situation is the limit of weak saturation , where the laser field can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "it is well known that in this case the excited state can be adiabatically eliminated , leading to an effective master equation for the density matrix of the ground state @xcite .",
    "these approximations result in optical coherences proportional to the amplitude of the laser field and excited state populations proportional to the light intensity .",
    "the characteristic evolution rate for the ground state populations and coherences is then given by the parameter @xmath53 known as the optical pumping rate and defined by @xmath54 the choice of the quantization axis is also a crucial point . clearly , when one introduces a magnetic field , the quantization axis is usually taken along this field .",
    "however , because the narrow structures are expected for very weak magnetic fields , a better physical insight can be obtained in the natural basis given , when b=0 , by the light polarization .",
    "in this basis , the steady state populations for the ground sublevels are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the atoms accumulate mostly in the level more interacting with the light field ( bright state ) , leading to a maximum in the fluorescence .",
    "when a magnetic field orthogonal to the quantization axis is applied , the populations of the ground states will be partially redistributed , because the zeeman states are no more eigenstate of the energy for @xmath57 .",
    "thus the population of levels weakly coupled to the excited state will increase at the expenses of the population of the bright states .",
    "this redistribution , leading to a _ decrease _ of the fluorescence rate , explains the bright resonance . to couple efficiently",
    "the zeeman sublevels the larmor frequency has to be of the order of the relaxation rate of the coherences or , in the case of a non - zero laser detuning , of the order of the energy separation due to the light - shift . because the relaxation rate of the coherences is @xmath53 , a narrow feature is expected , even if a more careful examination is needed to give the proportionality coefficient .",
    "notice also the strong analogy with the raman spectroscopy of @xmath58 optical molasses , where a two - photon process couples the zeeman sublevels @xcite .    if the magnetic field is used as quantization axis , a different description of the process originates with a creation of zeeman ground state coherence at zero magnetic field and its destruction at non zero values of magnetic fields characterizing the bright resonance .",
    "in fact the density matrix investigation required to analyse the hanle effect with quantization axis along the magnetic field direction is formally equivalent to that of the polarization gradient mechanism denominated as @xmath59 configuration . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the equivalence is realized by replacing the atomic larmor frequency in the applied magnetic field with the doppler shift of the atoms moving within the cooling laser field .",
    "thus the equations derived for the ground - state populations and coherences in those references eliminating adiabatically the optical coherences and the excited - state populations and coherences may be used to analyze the coherence creations in the bright line hanle effect .",

    "to point out out the basic features of the effect of narrow bright resonances , we have solved the obe for a cold atomic sample , where the laser light excites only one atomic hyperfine transition , with only the natural broadening .",
    "moreover for a cold sample the interaction time between laser and atoms may be assumed long enough to consider only the steady state solution of the density matrix equations .",
