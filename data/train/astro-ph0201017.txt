    "in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological scenario , structures in the universe form through hierarchical merging of smaller structures ( white & rees 1978 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 ; davis et al .  1985 ) .",
    "within this general framework , early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) in the cores of rich clusters form at high redshifts ( @xmath13 ) , corresponding with the first dark - matter overdensity peaks , as opposed to a later formation epoch for field e / s0 ( kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "clusters subsequently form around these seeds by accretion of smaller - mass galaxies , with significant structural and dynamical evolution occurring at more recent cosmological times .",
    "recent observations have shown that massive cluster e / s0 were already assembled at @xmath11 and subsequently evolved passively through ageing of their stellar populations ( e.g. van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "similarly , field e / s0 galaxies seem not to evolve dramatically between @xmath14 and @xmath6 , both in number ( schade et al.1999 , i m et al .",
    "2002 ) and structural properties ( van dokkum et al.2001 ; treu et al .  1999 , 2001b , hereafter t01b ) , although secondary episodes of star formation might be frequent at @xmath15 ( menanteau et al .  2001 ; treu et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter t02 ) . however , most observational results on the evolution of e / s0 concern the evolution of their stellar populations and little is known about the evolution of their internal structure .    to comprehensively quantify the luminosity , color _ and _ structural evolution of the stellar mass and of the dark - matter halo of e / s0 as function of redshift",
    ", we are conducting an observational program with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ) on the w.m .",
    "keck  ii telescope : the _ lenses structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey_. aim of the _ lsd survey _ is to measure the internal kinematics of a dozen gravitational - lens galaxies up to @xmath14 , allowing a powerful combination of dynamical and lensing constraints on their mass distribution .",
    "the lsd survey , its main goals and observing strategy will be described in detail elsewhere ( treu & koopmans 2002 , in preparation ) .    here",
    "we present the first result of the _ lsd survey _",
    ", a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy in the system mg2016 + 112 at @xmath0 . a summary of relevant prior observations and a new lens model can be found in koopmans et al.(2002 ) and references therein .",
    "the primary lens galaxy ( d ) in mg2016 + 112 is the highest spectroscopically - confirmed redshift lens galaxy known to date .",
    "the suggestion that this lens was embedded in a massive `` dark cluster '' , based on asca x - ray observations ( hattori et al .",
    "1997 ) , was recently shown to be incorrect by high - resolution chandra observations , showing no evidence for hot x - ray gas ( chartas et al .",
    "on the other hand , deep optical studies that show an overdensity of at least six bright e / s0 with the same redshift as the lens galaxy ( benitez et al .",
    "1999 ; soucail et al .",
    "2001 ; clowe et al .",
    "2001 ) . the absence of a significant weak - lensing signal ( clowe et al .",
    "2001 ) and the absence of x - ray emission , however , shows that these galaxies are not associated with a massive evolved cluster .    in the following ,",
    "we assume for definiteness that the hubble constant , the matter density , and the cosmological constant are h@xmath16  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we observed mg2016 + 112 using esi on the w.m .",
    "keck  ii telescope during four consecutive nights ( 2326 july , 2001 ) , with a total integration time of 8.5hrs .",
    "the seeing was good ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) and three out of four nights were photometric .",
    "between each exposure of 1800s , we dithered along the slit to allow for a better removal of sky residuals in the red end of the spectrum .",
    "the slit ( 20@xmath21 in length ) was positioned at a position angle of @xmath22 in order to include galaxies d and e , and arc  c@xmath23 ( see  fig .  [ plottwo ] ) .",
    "the slit width of @xmath24 yields an instrumental resolution of 30km@xmath25  which is adequate for measuring the stellar velocity dispersion and remove narrow sky emission lines .",
    "data reduction was performed using a newly developed iraf package , that combines the procedures described in treu et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001a ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the treatment of echelle distortions and sky subtraction .",
    "spectra of g  k giants observed at twilight with a @xmath26 slit width were used as stellar templates , after appropriate smoothing to match the instrumental resolution of the @xmath27 slit .",
    "the best fit was obtained for a g4-iii stellar template , using the gauss ",
    "hermite pixel - fitting software on the spectral region around the g band ( fig .",
    "[ plotone ] ) .",
    "this yielded a stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath1kms@xmath2 inside an effective circular aperture with radius 065 .",
    "the scatter in the fits for the different stellar templates was used to estimate the uncertainties related to template mismatches ( see t01a ) .",
    "the error on @xmath28 therefore includes both the random error contributions and the systematic uncertainties due to template mismatches , continuum fitting , and fitted spectral range .",
    "the inferred central velocity dispersion is @xmath29 , i.  e. @xmath30  kms@xmath2 .",
    "the correction is based on the average ratio ( and spread ) between the central stellar velocity dispersion ( i.e. measured in a @xmath31 aperture ) and the dispersion measured from a larger aperture ( @xmath32 in our case ) , as determined from local e / s0 ( see t01a for details ) . the predicted velocity dispersion from isothermal gravitational - lens models , i.e.  320340  km@xmath25  ( koopmans et al .",
    "2002 ) , is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic determination of the central stellar velocity dispersion ( see also kochanek 1993 , 1994 and kochanek et al .",
    "2000 for a general discussion ) .",
    "in addition , we detect [ oii ] emission from galaxies d and e at nearly identical redshifts ( @xmath0 ; fig.2 ) .      optical and infrared hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of the system are available from the hst archive . the near infrared camera and multi object spectrograph ( nicmos ) camera 2 imaged the galaxy in f160w for 5112s , while the wide field and planetary camera 2 imaged the system through filters f555w and f814w for 5200s each ( fig  [ plottwo ] ) .",
    "the images were reduced and surface photometry performed on the f160w and f814w images as described in treu et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001a ) , except that cosmic rays rejection on the f814w image was performed using the la cosmic algorithm ( van dokkum 2001 ) .",
    "the lens galaxy is very faint at f555w and barely detected in the planetary camera images , yielding a very uncertain flux .",
    "the galaxy brightness profiles are well represented by an @xmath33 profile , but the f160w- and f814w  band effective radii are significantly different and the galaxy shows a significant reddening towards its core .",
    "we attribute the larger effective radius in f814w  band to a bluer extended envelope around galaxy  d ( seen as a `` wing '' in the brightness profile ) , which presumably comes from a younger stellar population that has been accreted from smaller galaxies ( e.g. galaxy e ) . because the f160w  band light is a better tracer of the underlying old stellar population ( dominant in mass ) and is not contaminated by the [ oii ] emission line ( fig.2 ) , we only use @xmath34 for our analysis . in addition , the fits provided the integrated magnitudes and effective surface brightnesses .",
    "the relevant observational quantities of mg2016 + 112 are listed in tab .  1 .",
    "rest frame photometric quantities are corrected for galactic extinction using e(b - v)=0.235 from schlegel et al .",
    "using the stellar velocity dispersion , effective radius , effective surface brightness and colors of the lens galaxy , we can now quantify the evolution of its stellar mass - to - light ratio , as well as the age and metallicity of the dominant stellar population .",
    "a discussion is given in sec .",
    "recent studies have shown that e / s0 in clusters and in the field define a tight fundamental plane ( fp ) out to @xmath35 ( van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ; t02 ) , with slopes very similar to the ones observed in the local universe . assuming that galaxy d lies on a fp with slopes similar to those in the local universe ( bender et al . 1998 ) for the local fp in rest - frame b - band ( see t01b for discussion ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the local determination of the fp are negligible in our analysis . ]",
    ", we can obtain the evolution of the intercept @xmath36 of the fp with redshift , which is related to the evolution of the average effective mass to light ratio ( m / l ) . in fig .",
    "[ plotthree ] we plot the evolution of the m / l for cluster and field e / s0 as function of redshift ( small squares and pentagons ; from t02 ) , together with the value obtained for galaxy d ( large filled square ) . from the local fp , one finds an offset @xmath37  mag  arcsec@xmath38 , which corresponds to @xmath39 for pure luminosity evolution , the error being dominated by the observed fp parameters of galaxy d. we also note that errors on @xmath40 and sb@xmath41 are correlated and partly cancel in the fp relation ( e.g. treu et al .",
    "2001a ; herafter t01a ) .",
    "the m / l evolution is intermediate between that of clusters and field e / s0 , when we assume that a linear fit , @xmath42 ( see fig .  [ plotthree ] ) , provides a good description of the data and can be extrapolated to @xmath0 .",
    "eventhough this is only a single - galaxy measurement  not a determination of the fp at @xmath43  the inferred m / l evolution suggests that passive evolution of and old stellar population is a good representation of the evolution of massive e / s0 out to @xmath0 .",
    "additional measurements , covering a range of fp parameters , are needed to confirm this result .",
    "the color and m / l evolution of lens galaxy  d can be used to infer age and metallicity of its stellar population . a single - burst stellar population , generated with two independent population synthesis codes ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , gives a single - burst equivalent age of 2.8@xmath70.8  gyr ( i.e.  @xmath44@xmath91.9 ) and a supersolar metallicity @xmath45$]=0.25@xmath70.25 ( fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] ) , assuming there is no significant internal extinction in the lens galaxy .",
    "the contours in fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] are based on the @xmath46 difference between the model and the observed color and mass - to - light ratio evolution ( and their errors ) . because the colors and the luminosity can be dominated by a small mass - fraction of bright young stars",
    ", this age should be regarded as a lower limit for age of the dominant stellar population .",
    "the supersolar metallicity is slightly higher , but within 1@xmath47 consistent with results obtained from e / s0 in clusters at redshifts @xmath48 , which have been assembled through hierarchical merging of smaller galaxies ( e.g.  ferreras , charlot & silk 1999 ) .",
    "we have presented a direct measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy in the highest spectroscopically - confirmed redshift lens system mg2016 + 112 ( @xmath0 ) , as part of the _ lenses structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey_. the effective radius and surface brightness are determined from hst images , to compare the properties of the lens galaxy with those of e / s0 in the local universe .",
    "the colors and evolution of m / l@xmath49 of its stellar population , as derived by comparison to the local fp , indicate an old ( @xmath123gyr ) metal - rich stellar population , consistent with a passively evolved single stellar population formed at @xmath50 .",
    "the large stellar velocity dispersion and metallicity of the lens galaxy is comparable to the most massive present - day cluster galaxies ( ferreras et al .",
    "1999 ; fisher et al .",
    "in addition , the f814w - band surface brightness profile at large radii deviates slightly from the @xmath33 profile , possibly indicating an outer envelope , as typically found for brightest cluster galaxies and cd galaxies ( graham et al .",
    "this bluer envelope and the [ oii ] emission that we detect from galaxy d ( see also soucail et al .",
    "2001 ) could be due to the accretion of a younger stellar populations from smaller gas - rich galaxies , such as the closest companion to galaxy d for which we detect [ oii ] in emission ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the gravitational - lens system being embedded in a galaxy overdensity ( i.e. a proto - cluster ; see also benitez et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is not yet relaxed to a more centrally concentrated system and still shows evidence for ongoing merging and accretion .",
    "in addition , it would explain the absence of a significant weak - lensing signal ( clowe et al .",
    "2001 ) , the relatively small lensed - image separation , as well as constraints from recent chandra x - ray observations ( chartas et al .",
    "in particular , the spread of the velocities of the galaxies in the overdensity ( soucail et al.2001 ) , if they are assumed to be virialized , implies a mass three times larger than the 3@xmath47 upper limit inferred from the non - detection of extended x - ray emission with chandra ( chartas et al .",
    "we therefore think that the assumption of virialization is _ not _ correct and that these galaxies form a ( non - virialized ) proto - cluster .",
    "three galaxies in the field are spatially clustered at @xmath51 and might be falling towards the overdensity with high velocity ( soucail et al .",
    "2001 ) , consistent with a cluster in formation .",
