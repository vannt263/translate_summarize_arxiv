    "one of the most remarkable results in recent observational cosmology is the detection of type ia sne at cosmological distances . comparing the hubble diagram of these @xmath10 sne with the predictions of classical cosmological models strongly favors models with acceleration in the cosmic expansion , presumably due to a significant cosmological constant ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ) . given the far - reaching implications of this result , it is important to assess the possible systematic effects that could mimic the behavior of cosmic acceleration , and thus allow cosmologies without a cosmological constant .    intergalactic ( ig ) dust could provide such a systematic effect .",
    "the amount of dust required to fully account for the systematic dimming of sne at high redshift in an open universe is @xmath11 ( aguirre 1999a ; aguirre 1999b [ a99 ] ) .",
    "if this quantity of dust had the same composition as interstellar dust in the milky way , it would cause a significant reddening in the sn spectra , which is not observed .",
    "however , a99 showed that the removal of small dust grains during their ejection from galaxies into the ig medium could bias the composite dust cross section to cause little reddening for a given amount of extinction .",
    "a99 presented specific models for the evolution of the ig dust that are consistent with the observed lack of reddening , but provide the amount of extinction to fully account for the sne results in an open universe .    in the present paper , we study the observational consequences of the ig dust hypothesis in far infrared wavelength bands . as is well known from previous studies , ig dust would efficiently absorb the uv / optical flux of galaxies and quasars , and re - radiate this energy in the far infrared ( e.g. wright 1981 ; bond , carr & hogan 1991 ; loeb & haiman 1997 ) .",
    "although studied in great detail in these works , this effect is at present of renewed interest , owing to recent direct estimates of the global average comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) in the universe ( e.g. madau 1999 [ m99 ] ) , and determinations of the extragalactic uv / optical background ( uvb , bernstein 1997 ) , as well as of the cosmic far infrared background ( firb ; see fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ; puget et al 1996 ) .",
    "we thus have , for the first time , a measurement of both the uv reservoir available for dust absorption , as well as the background flux at the wavelengths where this energy would be emitted by the dust .    in this paper",
    ", we compute contributions to the firb and cmb arising from ig dust , and compare it to the measured values .",
    "our aim is to assess whether the amount and type of dust that would explain the sne results in an @xmath2 universe is compatible with these new observations .    at the present time , the source of the observed firb remains unclear , although rapid progress is being made using deep observations with scuba .",
    "barger et .",
    "al ( 1999a ) and hughes et al . (",
    "1998 ) have detected a population of discrete ir sources whose cumulative flux down in flux to @xmath12mjy accounts for at least 20 - 30% of the firb at 850@xmath13 m .",
    "the gravitationally lensed sample of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) goes further down to @xmath14mjy , but is more uncertain because of the lensing model and small number of detections .",
    "it it therefore currently uncertain whether the counts continue to sufficiently faint flux to account for all of the firb .",
    "furthermore , we lack information on the spectra of these sources at wavelengths other than 850@xmath13 m .",
    "although the full firb can be explained theoretically in semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( guiderdoni et al . 1998 ) , this requires the somewhat ad - hoc postulate that the ratio of the number of uligs ( a population of `` ultraluminous infrared galaxies '' ) to that of normal optical galaxies increases rapidly with redshift . in summary , according to our present knowledge , a fraction 70 - 80% of the firb could still be contributed by diffuse emission from ig dust  but this may change very quickly .    as in the case of the firb , the nature of the observed uvb is unclear .",
    "the directly observed values at 0.55 and 0.8@xmath13 m are 20@xmath15 ( bernstein 1997 ) . by comparison , a recent compilation of ground based galaxy counts , and",
    "a survey of galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) has yielded an estimate for the evolution of the global star formation rate in the universe between @xmath16 .",
    "the uvb that follows from a census of these galaxies is around @xmath17 ( madau 1999 [ m99 ] ; pozzetti et al . 1998 ) , a factor of @xmath18 smaller than the observed value . a natural explanation for the difference would be if the remaining @xmath19 of the uvb were contributed by faint , undetected galaxies ; however this appears to violate limits from the fluctuations in the uvb measured in the hdf ( vogeley 1997 ) . despite these uncertainties , the approximate amplitude of the uvb allows us to compute useful estimates of the contribution of ig dust to the firb .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we summarize our model for the amount and type of ig dust ; in   3 we describe our assumptions concerning the redshift evolution of both the uv emission and dust production , and outline our calculation methods ; and in   4",
    "we discuss limits from existing firas observations of the cmb .",
    "  5 contains our main results on the contribution to the firb from ig dust , as well as hopes for future tests of the dust hypothesis for the sn results ; and , in   6 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "unless otherwise stated , in this paper we adopt an open cosmology with total matter density @xmath20 and hubble constant @xmath21 .",
    "the model adopted here for ig dust is discussed at length in a99 ; here we provide only a brief summary .",
    "the model is based on the following method of estimating the total ig dust density @xmath22 : we first estimate the total metal density @xmath23 , then multiply this figure by the fraction @xmath24 of these metals which lie outside galaxies , and then by the fraction @xmath25 of ig metals is contained in ig dust .    as shown in a99 , both a direct integration of the sfr ( with an assumption of the metals produced for each star formed ) and fossil evidence from clusters",
    "indicate that @xmath26 ( adjusted from a99 for @xmath21 ) .",
    "these estimates follow from conservative assumptions : that stars in cluster galaxies have the same imf as in field galaxies , that there is not a dominant population of unobserved galaxies , etc . ; see a99 .",
    "measurements of the metallicity of intracluster gas indicate that a fraction @xmath27 of a typical cluster s metals lie in the intracluster medium ( e.g. renzini 1997 ) , presumably removed from the galaxies by some combination of winds , dust expulsion , ram - pressure stripping , and tidal disruption / merging of galaxies .",
    "while ram - pressure stripping and mergers may be more effective at removing metals from cluster galaxies , it is nevertheless likely that the figure @xmath27 applies to the field galaxies , since a much smaller value , together with the estimate of @xmath28 , would imply that field galaxies have mean metallicity several times solar  contrary to observation .    to estimate the fraction @xmath25 of ig metals in dust , we assume a value of @xmath29 for",
    "metals leaving the galaxy , as applies to the interstellar medium of both typical galaxies and perhaps even to damped ly-@xmath30 systems ( pei , fall & hauser 1998 ) .",
    "some fraction @xmath31 by mass of this dust must be destroyed either during ejection or in the ig medium , giving @xmath32 combining these figures , we estimate an ig dust density at @xmath33 of @xmath34 to fix both @xmath35 and the dust properties , we shall adopt the two - component draine & lee ( 1984 ) [ dl ] dust model of silicate and graphite spheres with size distribution @xmath36 ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 [ mrn ] ) as representative of galactic dust .",
    "we further assume that ig dust differs from mrn dust due to the removal  by the selective ejection of large grains and/or the selective destruction of small grains by sputtering  of the small - size end of the grain - size distribution . in this paper we use absorption and scattering curves as calculated in laor & draine ( 1993 ) , and the truncated mrn distribution with @xmath37 ; the minimal grain size ( which corresponds to @xmath38 ) is chosen to give dust which is grey enough not to over - redden the supernovae ( a99 ) .",
    "note that our results should not be sensitive to our adoption of the milky way dust cross section - e.g. lmc dust differs from milky way dust mainly at short wavelengths , where the opacity has anyway been modified by removing the small grains .",
    "silicate and graphite grains are assumed to have equal mass densities , and the total dust density is chosen , according to the cosmology , as that sufficient to reconcile the chosen cosmology with the supernova results .",
    "for example , @xmath20 requires @xmath39 mag of extinction at @xmath40 and hence @xmath41 to be consistent with the observations .",

    "in estimating the contribution from ig dust to the firb and the cmb , we follow the methods of wright ( 1981 ) ( see also loeb & haiman 1997 ) .",

    "the infrared background spectrum arises from the re - emission of uv light absorbed by dust .",
    "the two main factors determining the firb are therefore the evolution of the uv emissivity @xmath50 from stellar sources ( determining the dust temperature ) , as well as the evolution of the dust density , @xmath62  determining the overall amplitude of the emissivity . for the uv production rate , here we adopt the global average star",
    " formation rate as determined recently by madau et al .",
    "we ignore any additional uv flux from quasars : at the redshifts of interest here ( @xmath63 ) , the contribution to the uv background from the known population of quasars is less than 20% ( m99 ) .",
    "note , however , that a population of faint , undetected quasars could contribute substantially to the uv background ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) .    for simplicity , we assume further that the average spectrum from the stellar uv sources is described as that of black - body radiation at a temperature of @xmath64k .",
    "this is a reasonably good approximation to the continuum in the composite spectra found in the population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) , although the pure black - body spectrum is somewhat narrower .",
    "the black - body also falls below the uv background flux limit at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath65 m ) ; see also    [ sec - othermod ] .",
    "our results below depend primarily on the total amount of stellar light absorbed by the dust , and are insensitive to the precise shape of the uv spectrum ( see detailed discussion below ) . with the above assumptions ,",
    "the stellar emissivity is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the planck function , and @xmath68 is the star formation rate in madau et al .",

    "the overall normalization constant @xmath72 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "m99 argues that the total uv produced by stars is a factor @xmath73 smaller than the recent measurement of the extragalactic uv background , @xmath74 at @xmath75 m by bernstein ( 1997 ) .",
    "it is not clear what the reason for this discrepancy is ; the shortage of uv could be provided by additional faint galaxies or quasars ( however , see vogeley 1997 ) . here",
    "we take the simplest approach , and adjust the normalization constant @xmath72 so that the measured value of @xmath76 for the uv background at 0.55@xmath13 m is exactly reproduced ( taking into account dust absorption ) .",
    "given the shortage of uv provided by the known stellar population , we will also examine below a model normalized to @xmath77 , the lower end of the @xmath78 range quoted by bernstein ( 1997 ) .",
    "this also lies above the lower limits on the uv background derived from galaxy counts in the hubble deep field ( pozzetti et al .",
    "1998 ; see figure  [ fig - spectrum ] ) . note that we have assumed a specific spectral shape and redshift - evolution of the uv emissivity .",
    "we again emphasize that our results are insensitive to the detailed shape of the uv flux around 1@xmath13 m , and depend only on the total amount of uv light absorbed ; this is demonstrated by a model we examine below with a more realistic spectrum obtained from population synthesis models ( bruzual & charlot 1996 ) and models with sf histories different from m99 .",
    "as mentioned above , the difference between the background inferred from the observed star - formation rate ( i.e. by direct integration of @xmath79 and an empirical uv flux per stellar mass ratio ) , and the measured value of @xmath80 could be provided by undetected quasars , or other yet undiscovered sources . as long as the redshift evolution of these sources does not depart significantly from the range of our assumed @xmath81 s",
    ", our results below would remain valid .",
    "next , we assume that the same stellar population that produces the uv background is the source of ig dust . under this simple assumption , the mass density of dust increases in proportion to the mass density in stars : @xmath82 and we assume further that @xmath83 ( as discussed in   5 the exact value of",
    "this ratio is not crucial ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath84 is chosen by requiring the total optical depth due to dust absorption + scattering between @xmath85 and @xmath86 to be @xmath87 . as we argued in section ",
    "[ sec - dustmodel ] above , this is the amount needed to account for the sn results ( a99 ) .",
    "this normalization corresponds to @xmath88 .",
    "adding to the arguments given in   [ sec - dustmodel ] , we note that this dust density fits in comfortably with the amount of dust expected to be produced in normal stars .",
    "for instance , assuming that each type ii sn ( @xmath89 ) yields @xmath90 of dust , adopting a scalo imf , and normalizing @xmath91 ; we obtain @xmath92 ( cf . loeb & haiman 1997 ) . this estimate does not account for dust trapped in galaxies or destroyed , but is also a lower limit since it only includes the dust formed in supernovae , and not that formed in ( for example ) dense clouds or carbon stars .",
    "we note that although stellar dust production can not occur instantaneously with star - formation , the relevant time - scales are likely to be much shorter than the hubble time at redshifts of interest .",
    "type ii sne produce dust in a few million years ; while the lifetime of carbon stars ( believed to be dominating the dust budget in the milky way , see gehrz 1989 ) is still only @xmath931 gyr . the ejection timescale for dust leaving spiral galaxies",
    "is probably between 100 and 1000 myr ( a99 ) .",
    "we have found that incorporating a delay of @xmath931 gyr between star formation and dust production into equation [ eq : omdust ] does not change our results below by more than a few percent .",
    "equations [ eq : photons]-[eq : omdust ] , together with the initial condition that @xmath94 at some high redshift is equal to the pure cmb with @xmath95k , determine the redshift evolution of the full background spectrum .",
    "[ sec - calcmethod ]",
    "any existing ig dust component will process some uv / optical energy into the fir / microwave . as a result ,",
    "some ( perhaps vanishingly small ) fraction of the observed cmb is due to emission from ig dust .",
    "this contribution has been studied a number of times previously .",
    "some authors have investigated the possibility that the cmb is entirely dust - processed emission from astrophysical objects ; see , e.g. , layzer & hively ( 1973 ) , wright ( 1982 ) , wollman ( 1992 ) and aguirre ( 1999c ) on ` cold big - bang ' models , or wickramasinghe et al .",

    ", thermalization takes place at very high @xmath42 after energy emission by population iii objects .",
    "both cosmologies require grains of a type that can maintain a temperature very close to that of the cmb .",
    "if the grains have a temperature only slightly different from that of the cmb , they will be too cool to contribute to the firb ; however , spectral distortions of an initially blackbody cmb will occur ( e.g. rowan - robinson , negroponte & silk 1979 ; hawkins & wright 1988 ; bond et al .",
    "more recently , this effect has been used by loeb & haiman ( 1997 ) and by ferrara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to limit the density of ig dust . we shall perform a similar analysis using the method and assumptions outlined in ",
    "[ sec - calcmethod ] , and with the dust model described in   [ sec - dustmodel ] .",
    "models which distort the cmb at long ( @xmath96 mm ) wavelengths can be easily constrained since there is a clear model for the cmb ( perfect blackbody ) .",
    "but in the absence of an equally unique and well - defined model for the firb , it is much less clear how to limit fir emission that does not actually exceed the observed fir background .",
    "the procedure adopted here is as follows : following the methodology of fixsen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we fit the results from @xmath97 by a blackbody @xmath98 plus a ` uniform dust component ' parameterized by an emissivity and temperature in a @xmath99 spectrum .",
    "these fitted components are shown in dotted lines in figure  [ fig - spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum with the cmb _ only _ subtracted is shown as a solid line ; this makes clear the contribution of ig dust emission to the firb .",
    "the residuals with both components subtracted are shown in the second panel , along with the firas frequency range ( vertical dotted lines ) and the limit on r.m.s .",
    "deviations from blackbody ( horizontal dotted line ) .",
    "an interesting note about this general procedure is the following .",
    "our calculations show that the fitted cmb temperature may be close to , but not exactly the same as the actual initial cmb , and this small discrepancy affects the measured slope of the fir emission at @xmath100 , since the firb is @xmath101 of the cmb flux there .",
    "for example , fitting the cmb plus @xmath102 gives a fitted cmb temperature of @xmath103k , exactly as it should be .",
    "but if we fit a cmb plus @xmath104 ( the shape of the firas fit ) , we find @xmath105k .",
    "the cmb is then slightly under - subtracted , and the residual firb closely follows a @xmath106 shape at long-@xmath107 .",
    "this suggests that accurately determining the slope of the firb long - wavelength tail requires knowledge of @xmath108 to much higher accuracy than available from cobe data .",
    "for this reason , we find it is not useful to compare the firb slope predicted by models to the firas fit , for @xmath109 .",
    "table  [ tab - models ] gives the r.m.s .",
    "deviation from blackbody for the computed spectra , with the mean taken over the @xmath110 wavelength range analyzed by fixsen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and divided by the peak of @xmath98 .",
    "the limit given by fixsen et al .",
    "1996 on this number is @xmath111 .",
    "the result of this analysis is that the dust emission would not cause detectable distortions to the cmb for the dust model described , despite the fact that the amount of emission appears to violate the quoted limits on the @xmath112 parameter .-",
    "parameter from the cobe group must be used with caution .",
    "rather large spectral distortions can be ` hidden ' in the microwave tail of the firb which has a poorly defined spectral shape .",
    "assuming conservatively that the firb as detected by firas exists in the 150 - 600 ghz range ( and zero outside ) , it corresponds to a @xmath112-parameter in the full 60 - 600 ghz interval of @xmath113 , over an order of magnitude above the quoted upper limit . ]",
    "the residuals are , of course , even smaller if the ` uniform dust component ' is fit using a free index in the power law .    on",
    "the other hand , modification of the long - wavelength opacity of the dust can be important , since dust types with higher fir opacity have lower equilibrium temperatures which may lead to excessive emission into the firb / cmb .",
    "since the dust emission tends to be well described by the fitted @xmath102 isotropic dust component , this emission does not tend to leave excessive distortion in the cmb residuals .",
    "rather , it leads to a fit of the isotropic dust component incompatible with that found by firas .",

    "this time - dependent template is convolved with the sfr from m99 to find the redshift - evolution of the frequency dependent uv emissivity .",
    "the full spectrum under these assumptions is shown by the curve labeled `` bc '' in figure  [ fig - spectra1 ] .",
    "the peak in the uvb from the direct galactic emission is broader than in our fiducial model , and extends to higher energies .",
    "as mentioned above , this procedure results in a uvb at @xmath85 that falls short of the measured value by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "overall , the contribution to the firb is not effected significantly : it is reduced only by @xmath147 relative to our fiducial model at @xmath148 m ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab - models ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that the above procedure is not strictly correct , as we have not corrected the galactic templates for reddening by dust internal to the galaxy .",
    "this reddening could be important in the present context , since it makes the uv peak steeper in the @xmath149 m range , and allow a broader uvb in this wavelength range that reaches @xmath150 at @xmath75 m , while extending to energies higher than assumed in our fiducial model .",
    "here we do not attempt to derive an accurate reddening correction ( see instead madau et al .",
    "rather , our aim is to assess the maximum uv flux that could , in principle , be present in the @xmath149 m range , that is consistent with both the voyager upper limit ( murthy , henry & holberg 1998 ) and the @xmath75 m detection .    to compute this maximal uv flux , we reddened the galactic template spectrum , assuming the cross section of milky way dust ( dl ) , with a total ( unrealistically high ) maximum optical depth of @xmath151 .",
    "we then re - scaled the uv efficiency by a factor of @xmath9310 to retain an intensity of @xmath150 at @xmath75 m .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown by the curve labeled `` bc2 '' in figure  [ fig - spectra1 ] .",
    "this spectrum fits in with both the voyager and bernstein ( 1997 ) data points , and reasonably represents the maximally allowed uv emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that a simultaneous fit to these two data - points requires a very steep spectrum ( @xmath116 at 0.55@xmath13 m to @xmath152 at 0.1@xmath13 m , implying a slope of @xmath153 ) , which can only be derived from the bruzual - charlot template by postulating an exceedingly high reddening .",
    "one resolution of this paradox might be that the true value of the uvb is closer to @xmath132 ( as argued by vogeley 1997 in a different context ) .",
    "we find that with this maximal emission , the firb contribution increases somewhat , but the change is once again not significant , only @xmath154 relative to the galactic model without reddening , over - predicting the 850@xmath13 m firb by @xmath155 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab - models ] ) , but still well within the @xmath156 uncertainty .",
    "third , we have tested our assumption that we may treat the grain - size distribution as a single component , by considering grains of a single grain size @xmath157 , for @xmath128 ( model mg ) and @xmath130 ( model lg ) .",
    "these extremes change the @xmath85 temperature by @xmath158 and the @xmath119 flux by @xmath159 , demonstrating that the approximation is not very important .",
    "the test also shows that the results are not sensitive to the grain size distribution , as long as all of the grains are relatively large ( @xmath160 ) . the exact graphite :",
    "silicate ratio is also fairly unimportant ; models gra and s2 have graphite : silicate ratios of 1:0 and 1:2 respectively .",
    "the former corresponds to a scenario in which silicates are preferentially destroyed ( see a99 ) ; the latter is an extreme of reasonable graphite : silicate ratios for two - component model , as shown in the recent computations of weingartner & draine 1999 .",
    "neither is drastically different from the fiducial model , and the s2 model is almost identical .    finally , we check our assumption that the dust temperature follows from equilibrium with a homogeneous background radiation bath , because dust near concentrations of radiation could have somewhat higher temperature . to determine whether this might be important , we have computed the critical distance @xmath161 ( from center of a model galaxy ) at which a dust grain would feel equal contributions from the cosmic uvb intensity @xmath162 and from the nearby galaxy , i.e. @xmath163 where the galaxy luminosity @xmath164 ( corresponding to a @xmath165 starburst galaxy , with the spectral model of bruzual & charlot 1996 ) is constant and @xmath162 is proportional to the integrated comoving sfr and has the value @xmath116 at @xmath85 .",
    "the result is that @xmath166kpc for all @xmath42 and @xmath167kpc for @xmath168 . in a99 , it was argued that ig dust must be @xmath169kpc from its progenitor galaxy to be uniform enough to be in accord with limits on the dispersion in supernova brightnesses .",
    "thus even near extremely bright galaxies , dust of the a99 model should have temperature dominated by the isotropic background rather than nearby galaxies .    as discussed in   [ sec - calcmethod ] , there are still sizeable uncertainties in the normalization of the uv spectrum .",
    "the 1@xmath121 lower limits from bernstein ( 1997 ) roughly coincide with the lower limits given by integrated counts ( m99 ) at @xmath170 at @xmath117 .",
    "we have employed this normalization ( model luv ) , and find that this lowers the @xmath119 flux by about 30% ( the decrease in energy is somewhat offset by the lower temperature of the dust ) .",
    "although most models considered predict an @xmath119 flux comparable to that detected by firas , some models exceed the firas upper limit . to reconcile the supernova measurements with a closed ,",
    "matter - dominated cosmology  such as the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm )  an extinction of @xmath171 is required ( a99 ) , in turn requiring @xmath172 for @xmath173 in the present model this predicts an @xmath119 flux which exceeds the @xmath174 bound of the firas detection ( see the scdm model in table  [ tab - models ] . ) with the lower uv normalization , however , the emission is marginally compatible with the errors .",
    "( model scdmb in table  [ tab - models ] ) .",
    "if the higher uv normalization holds , these results make it very unlikely that ig dust could reconcile scdm with the supernova observations , even if the large necessary quantity of dust existed ( cf .",
    "the present calculations can also constrain the properties of intergalactic dust if it is assumed to be responsible for the supernova dimming .",
    "very grey dust , for instance , absorbs more uv / optical flux for a given v - band extinction ( and can hence overproduce the firb ) . both very grey dust and ` standard ' dust with high ir emissivity can also have lower equilibrium temperature , which overproduces the firb at long wavelengths . to limit these sorts of dust ,",
    "we have considered two illustrative types .",
    "the first is dust that is grey out to some wavelength @xmath175 , then falls as @xmath176 : @xmath177}. \\label{eq - needlekappa}\\ ] ]    this is conservative in the sense of ensuring the maximum reasonable temperature for a given @xmath175 .",
    "models ( g05-g10 ) are of this type , and show that for @xmath178 the firb is overproduced .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that @xmath179 models actually produce a firb fitting the observations rather well over the entire frequency range .",
    "conducting needles have an absorption spectrum which can be roughly modeled by eq .",
    "[ eq - needlekappa ] ( wright 1982 ; wickramasinghe & wallis 1996 ; aguirre 1999a ) , and using wright s 1982 rc model with a resistivity of @xmath180 , we can rule out needle models with length - to - diameter ratio @xmath181 . and high conductivity , such as the iron whiskers of hoyle & wickramasinghe ( 1988 ) , can maintain a temperature very close to that of the cmb and are not constrained by the present calculations ; see also aguirre ( 1999c ) . ]",
    "the second dust type is ` standard ' dl / mrn dust , but with long - wavelength ( @xmath182 ) emissivity given by @xmath183 with @xmath184",
    "fluffy / fractal grains can give @xmath185 ( e.g. wright 1987 ; stognienko et al . 1995 ) , and @xmath30 generally depends upon the optical properties of the grain material .",
    "dust with @xmath186 generally has lower temperature , and the calculations ( see models l1.0 , l1.5 in table  [ tab - models ] ) show that such dust will overproduce the @xmath119 firb ( at the @xmath78 level ) for @xmath187 . on the other hand ,",
    "if dust had @xmath188 , model l2.5 shows that the higher resulting temperature would lead to less flux at @xmath119 .",
    "the comoving dust temperature @xmath189 for the fiducial model and models gr05 and l1.0 is shown in figure  [ fig - tdust ] .",
    "all computed models fall within the range spanned by the gr05 and l1.0 models .    in summary , using only the firas limits on the firb , we can with some confidence rule out scdm models , ` very grey ' dust models with @xmath178 , and dust models with lower law index @xmath190 in their long - wavelength emissivity .",
    "the next section discusses stronger constraints which derive from the fraction of the measured firb which is known to be due to discrete sources .",
    "[ sec - othermod ]      when constraining models using their predicted ig dust contribution to the firb , we have so far considered the full value of the firb . however , as mentioned above , we already know that the entire firb can not be comprised of ig dust emission alone . on the one hand , the ig dust models generally fail to produce the short wavelength fluxes ; on the other hand , observations have already resolved a non - negligible fraction @xmath191 of the firb into discrete sources . if @xmath192 of the firb is accounted for by resolved sources , the numbers in column six of table  [ tab - models ] should be multiplied by 1.25 - 1.5 , as only @xmath193 of the measured firb can be ig dust emission . to use instead the @xmath78 upper limit on the detected firb , but taking into account the resolved fraction ,",
    "column six should be multiplied by @xmath194 .",
    "the calculations therefore indicate that resolving the firb further could provide significantly stronger constraints on the models .",
    "it must also be noted , however , that there is a @xmath195 uncertainty in the scuba flux calibration , and that the quoted errors on the measured firb are really rough estimates of systematic uncertainty reflecting only differences between the fits resulting from different foreground subtraction method . for comparison , guiderdoni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) give an allowed firb intensity range at @xmath196 of @xmath197 at @xmath174 .",
    "these uncertainties correspond to roughly four to five times those quoted by fixsen et al .    at the present time , a handful ( @xmath198 ) of objects with fluxes @xmath199 above @xmath200mjy at @xmath119 have been detected by scuba .",
    "these data have been used to derive the empirical number counts @xmath201 of sources , as a function of apparent flux . at the limiting flux of @xmath202mjy , the total contribution from these objects",
    "is a fraction @xmath192 of the firb value ( barger et al .",
    "as emphasized by these authors , the faint - end counts are very steep ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "extrapolating at the faint end of the number counts to @xmath9mjy would then account for the entire measured background .",
    "these conclusions are further supported by the somewhat less reliable detections of faint sources down to @xmath204mjy : the gravitationally lensed sample of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) extends to this limit , albeit with only a four sources fainter than @xmath12mjy .    in light of these existing measurements , and especially because of the steepness of the faint - end number counts , tightening the constraints obtained in this paper requires relatively small further improvements in the observations .",
    "in particular , with a faint - end slope of -3.2 , the flux limit needs to be lowered only by a factor of four , to @xmath205mjy , to detect the sources that account for the whole of the firb , provided these sources exist .",
    "if the faint sources do not exist , then these measurements will find the turn - over and flattening in @xmath201 , and yield the actual fraction of the firb not accounted for by these sources .",
    "if the faint sources are detected , the uncertainty in their total cumulative flux would be relatively small , since these sources are expected to be numerous .",
    "a complication we have ignored in this analysis is the following : most ig dust emission occurs at @xmath206 , where a tentative redshift analysis ( barger et al .",
    "1999b and references therein ) indicates that most of the scuba @xmath119 sources lie .",
    "the source fluxes are derived using a 30 arcsec aperture , which at @xmath168 corresponds to a physical size of @xmath207kpc .",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that the ig dust is effectively uniform , but at @xmath208 significant quantities could be within @xmath209kpc of galaxies , so there is a danger that the scuba derived fluxes include some emission from what we have termed ig dust .",
    "upcoming sub - mm surveys with better angular resolution should be able to clarify this ambiguity .    in summary , with a factor of four improvement over the current scuba detection threshold",
    ", we would either see explicitly the need for something else to explain the firb , or else a fairly tight constraint on the ig dust will be possible .",
    "forthcoming instruments such _ bolocam _ and _ sirtf _ will reach the required sensitivities at 160@xmath13 m and 1100@xmath13 m ( see table 1 in blain 1999 ) .",
    "the constraints that can be obtained then might then be limited by the accuracy of the absolute measurement of the coarse - grained firb .",
    "the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) on the future planck satellite , covering the @xmath210 m range at several intermediate frequencies , will be able to greatly improve our existing knowledge of the unresolved component . finally ,",
    "as shown by haiman & knox ( 1999 ) , angular correlations in the firb are expected to be at the few percent level , and depend strongly on the nature of its sources .",
    "future instruments such as _ blaze _ and _ firbat _ will be able to measure these correlations , providing another diagnostic that distinguishes between ig dust and discrete sources .    [",
    "sec - resolve ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the far infrared emission from the type and amount of ig dust necessary to explain the recent hubble diagrams , derived from observations of type ia sne at redshifts @xmath0 , in cosmological models without a cosmological constant .",
    "in particular , we computed the contribution from the ig dust emission to the value of the firb recently measured by the cobe satellite .",
    "we investigated a broad range of models , and focused on the wavelength of @xmath148 m , where the largest fraction of the firb is presently resolved into discrete sources , thus yielding the strongest constraints .",
    "the current constraints are limited by @xmath211 errors in each of the following : the dust model , the measured firb flux , the scuba counts and the scuba calibration .",
    "our results show that the ig dust emission is consistent with the spectral distortion of the cmb allowed by present cobe data , but may contribute nearly all of the _ unresolved _ fraction of the firb in the @xmath212 m range . in a few specific models ,",
    "this contribution is sufficiently large to render those models implausible , including standard cdm and models with very grey dust , or dust with unusually high ir emissivity . in the ( perhaps most interesting )",
    "case of an open universe with a low matter density ( @xmath20 ) , we find that the contribution is still within the experimental uncertainty . assuming that 20% of the firb is accounted for by the discrete scuba sources , the ig dust contributes up to @xmath213 of the @xmath156 limit on the _ unresolved _ fraction .",
