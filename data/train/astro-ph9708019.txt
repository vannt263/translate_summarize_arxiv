    "the mean - field magnetic dynamo ( mfmd ) has been a standard framework for understanding the origin of large scale magnetic fields ( b - fields ) in planets stars and galaxies ( @xcite ) . in this mechanism",
    ", a large scale seed field grows exponentially at the expense of small scale turbulent energy .",
    "this can be distinguished from fast dynamo turbulent amplification of b - fields ( e.g. @xcite ) , which occurs on the scale of the input turbulence .",
    "many systems such as planetary and solar spots ( @xcite ) , and accretion and galactic disks ( @xcite ) also show evidence for large scale vortex structures .",
    "jets may also be related . in the absence of b - fields ,",
    "the mean vorticity equation is similar to the mean magnetic induction equation ( @xcite ) and can allow mean field vorticity dynamo ( mfvd ) growth . when the mutual coupling of vorticity and b - field is considered , the mean quantity whose time evolution is of interest has 6 components : 3 components each for the mean b - field and mean vorticity .",
    "growth arises in this coupled mean field dynamo ( cmfd ) .",
    "we first derive the equations for mean and fluctuating quantities and show that the evolution equations for the mean vorticity and b - field are non - trivial only when the turbulence is at least weakly inhomogeneous and anisotropic . by expanding the turbulent quantities to first order in the time - varying mean velocity and mean b - field , we derive the initial mutual dynamo growth for several sets of initial conditions .",
    "when cross - correlations between turbulent velocities and turbulent b - fields vanish , mutual field growth is described by decoupled mfvd and mfmd equations . however ,",
    "when the cross correlations do not vanish , the time evolution of the mean fields is coupled . as a result",
    ", we find that a seed mean vorticity and small scale b - field can allow growth of the mean b - field even when the latter is initially zero , in contrast to the decoupled theory .",
    "we include the mean b - field backreaction on the velocity flows to lowest order , thus deriving corrections to the kinematic magnetic and vorticity dynamo coefficients . however , we do not compute these corrections to higher order , nor do we purport to offer a fully developed non - linear theory of mhd turbulence .",
    "we make explicit assumptions / approximations , but emphasize that none of these are beyond those used in standard mean - field dynamo treatments .",
    "( in many treatments , the same approximations are imposed without explanation . )",
    "we are aware of the controversies of the non - linear backreaction ( e.g. @xcite ) , but inasmuch as the `` @xmath1''(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) or `` @xmath2 '' ( e.g. @xcite ) dynamos are at least a framework for the study of b - field generation and comparison with observations , so too is the more generalized treatment of the vorticity - magnetic field dynamo developed herein .",
    "consider the navier - stokes equation for incompressible flows in the presence of b - fields ,    @xmath3 + { \\bf f}({\\bf x } , t)+\\nabla\\phi , \\end{array } \\label{ns}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is a constant viscosity , @xmath5 is a forcing function , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the constant density normalized b - field .",

    "the vorticity equation ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , is obtained by taking the curl of ( [ ns ] ) .",
    "the induction equation for @xmath12 is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is a constant magnetic viscosity .",
    "next , decompose @xmath15 , and @xmath16 into mean ( indicated by an overbar or @xmath17 ) and fluctuating ( indicated by prime ) components @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively with @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is a constant global velocity whose curl is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the time dependent mean components whose spatial scales of variation are smaller spatial than that of @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath23 supplies helicity to the turbulence and ensures that any growth of @xmath25 represents a transfer of angular momentum from the turbulence .",
    "( alternatively , the helicity could be supplied by @xmath26 . )",
    "we assume that derivatives with respect to @xmath27 or @xmath28 obey @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( reynolds relations ( @xcite ) ) , where @xmath31 are components of vector functions of @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    ". for statistical ensemble means , these hold when the correlation time scales are short relative to the variation times of mean quantities . for the spatial mean , defined by @xmath32 , the relations hold when",
    "the averaging is taken over a large enough scale , such that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "subtracting the mean of ( [ ns ] ) from itself , and assuming @xmath36 , gives    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",
    "the average of ( [ vorticity ] ) is    @xmath39    where we have neglected terms second order in time - varying mean quantities .",
    "subtracting ( [ omegabar ] ) from ( [ vorticity ] ) gives    @xmath40    similarly , the equation for the mean b - field , derived by averaging ( [ induction ] ) is    @xmath41    subtracting ( [ bbar ] ) from ( [ induction ] ) yields the equation for the fluctuating b - field    @xmath42    growth of @xmath43 or @xmath25 requires the @xmath44 terms in ( [ bbar ] ) and ( [ omegabar ] ) to be non - vanishing .",
    "however , when the turbulence is strictly homogeneous in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , these quantities vanish . for purely isotropic turbulence , the term @xmath47 in ( [ bbar ] ) vanishes since it is the average of a vector , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 vanish from reynolds rules and incompressibility .",

    "we assume weakly anisotropic inhomogeneous turbulence : terms linear in the time - varying mean quantities contribute , but their averaged 0@xmath50 order coefficients , are taken to be isotropic and homogeneous ( still allowing for reflection asymmetry ) . iterating the equations using the formal solutions for the turbulent fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and using times appropriately chosen such that the correlations @xmath53 , we obtain to first order in mean quantities    @xmath54    with similar expressions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "consider the pressure in the isoentropic energy equation ( hereafter neglecting microphysical fluid and magnetic viscosities ) @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the adiabatic index ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed incompressibility ( @xmath61 and constant @xmath62 ) above , but here we must allow @xmath63 for the last term in the energy equation : even though @xmath64 is small , the sound speed is large ( _ i.e. _ @xmath60 is large , see @xcite ) such that the magnitude of @xmath65 can not be ignored .",
    "this is why the energy equation is normally not useful in incompressible approaches .",
    "but here it will be symmetry properties of the energy equation that account for the absence of a pressure contribution when used in ( [ pterms ] ) and the seemingly offending term will not contribute .",

    "a similar analysis holds for the second term in ( [ pterms ] ) when put into ( [ bbar ] ) ; thus , the pressure does not contribute to ( [ omegabar ] ) or ( [ bbar ] ) .",

    "the cross - correlations @xmath89 , taken to vanish in @xcite , need not vanish , as they preserve all mhd symmetries in ( [ weqm ] ) and ( [ beqm ] ) .",
    "we will now see how the finite helicity is required for both b - field ( @xcite ) and vorticity growth ( @xcite ) .    to show the growth , we assume constant dynamo coefficients and consider the simple case when the last 3 terms in ( [ weqm ] ) and the last term in ( [ beqm ] ) are negligible .",
    "this assumption is valid in systems for which @xmath23 is perpendicular to the gradient of the time varying mean quantities , and for which the former is relatively uniform or perpendicular to the dominant b - field component .",
    "( the influence of @xmath23 is always present however , in providing reflection asymmetry to the 0@xmath50 order turbulent quantities . )",
    "the simplified equations yield a generalized vorticity - magnetic @xmath1 dynamo .",
    "the mean - field equations are then solved by assuming solutions of the form exp@xmath90 to obtain the linear algebraic equations @xmath91 .",

    "the general @xmath99 matrix equation can be solved numerically for @xmath100 and contains all decaying and growing modes . because the @xmath101 are combinations of the initial @xmath102 , for growing modes , all components of @xmath103 and @xmath104 will in general grow unless very specific initial conditions @xmath105 and values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 make certain @xmath96 vanish .",

    "we see that terms with one higher derivative in the mean quantities are reduced by a factor @xmath120 .",

    "have considered solutions of an @xmath1 vorticity - magnetic dynamo .",
    "an important implication of ( [ weqm ] ) and ( [ beqm ] ) is that the mean b - field can grow even when its initial value is zero because a seed mean b - field can be generated by a coupling between the small scale b - field to the small scale velocity , and the latter to the mean vorticity .",

    "astrophysical applications of more extensive treatments may include accretion disks , where vortices and b - fields can combine to concentrate emerging radiation into strong beams ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , yoshizawa & yokoi ( 1993 ) showed that an equation similar to ( [ beqm ] ) can lead to generation of toroidal fields whose upward pressure drives a jet that subsequently may develop poloidal fields .",
