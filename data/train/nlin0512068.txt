    "in recent years , an important subject of the theoretical studies became the coherent phenomena in the anisotropic media .",
    "this is caused by the significant progress in the technologies of growing the semiconductor crystals and producing the low - dimensional quantum structures .",
    "unlike to the case of isotropic media , the parity of the stationary states of the quantum particles located in the anisotropic medium is not well defined . as a result ,",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix of the dipole moment operator and their difference usually called the permanent dipole moment ( pdm ) of the transition may not vanish .",
    "the dynamics of one - component extremely short electromagnetic pulses in the presence of pdm was considered in works@xmath1 .",
    "the stationary pulse solutions decreasing exponentially and algebraically of the full maxwell  bloch equations for the two - level medium were found@xmath2 .",
    "it was shown that these solutions possess an asymmetry on the pulse polarity .",
    "the complete integrability of the corresponding system of the reduced maxwell ",
    "bloch equations with the help of the inverse scattering transformation method@xmath3 was revealed in paper@xmath4 .",
    "the multisoliton solutions were constructed on fixed background , which was selected in such a manner that the problem under consideration is reduced to isotropic case .",
    "the effects of a pump on dynamics of these pulses were discussed in@xmath5 . also , the numerical study of the pulse formation in the medium possessing pdm was performed@xmath6 .",
    "an existence of solitary stable bipolar signal with nonzero time area was discovered .",
    "the asymmetry on the polarity manifested itself there in that the sign of the time area is determined by the sign of pdm .",
    "the propagation through optically uniaxial medium of the two - component electromagnetic pulses consisting of short - wavelength ordinary and long - wavelength extraordinary components was investigated in@xmath7 .",
    "as opposite to the case of one - component pulses mentioned above , an application of the slowly varying envelope approximation does not eliminate the influence of pdm in this problem .",
    "it was shown that , under conditions of a strong interaction between the components , the regimes of the pulse propagation may differ from the self - induced transparency .",
    "various regimes of the optical transparency were classified with respect to the pulse velocity and the degree of the resonant medium excitation .",
    "the two - component pulse solutions possess also the pdm - induced asymmetry : signs of the pulse extraordinary component and pdm are opposite .",
    "it is remarkable that the equations distinguishing from ones studied in@xmath7 by notations only describe the two - component ( transverse - longitudinal ) acoustic pulse propagation in the low - temperature paramagnetic crystal@xmath8 .    to investigate the propagation of the two - component pulses in optically uniaxial medium ,",
    "we apply here the approximation of the unidirectional propagation instead of the slowly varying envelope approximation . the two - component system of reduced maxwell ",
    "bloch equations is derived and , as in the case treated in works@xmath7 , its acoustic analogue is found .",
    "the properties of exponentially and algebraically decreasing pulse solutions of these equations are discussed .",
    "consider the optically uniaxial medium containing the two - level quantum particles .",
    "let the medium optical axes coincide with @xmath9 axes of the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "suppose that the plane electromagnetic pulse propagates through the medium in the positive direction of @xmath10 axes .",
    "then , ordinary @xmath11 and extraordinary @xmath12 components of the electric field of the pulse are parallel to @xmath13 and @xmath9 axes , respectively .",
    "the maxwell equations yield in the case we study the next system for the electric field components : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the ordinary and extraordinary components of the polarization , which is induced by the two - level particles ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices , respectively ; @xmath20 is the speed of light in free space .    to describe the evolution of the state of the quantum particle , we make use the von  neumann equation on density matrix @xmath21 : @xmath22 . \\label{3}\\ ] ] here hamiltonian @xmath23 of the two - level particle",
    "is defined as given @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the resonant frequency of quantum transition @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the plank s constant ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the matrices of the projection of the dipole moment operator on @xmath13 and @xmath9 axes , respectively .    in the geometry chosen ,",
    "the expressions for the polarization components are @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the concentration of the quantum particles . since the medium is axially symmetric , the matrices of the dipole moment have the following form : @xmath33 @xmath34 then hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) reads as @xmath35 and equation ( [ 3 ] ) gives the next system for the density matrix elements : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is pdm of the transition",
    ". formulas ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 5])([8 ] ) imply @xmath39 @xmath40    let us suppose that concentration of the quantum particles is small ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the order of derivatives in the equations for the electric field components can be reduced in this case . indeed , by applying the approximation of the unidirectional propagation@xmath42 to equations ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) and excluding the derivatives of the elements of the density matrix with the help of formulas ( [ 10a ] ) and ( [ 11a ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath43 @xmath44    it is convenient for the subsequent consideration to rewrite equations ( [ 10a ] ) , ( [ 11a ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) in dimensionless form @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    obviously , system ( [ 14])([17 ] ) coincides with the reduced maxwell ",
    "bloch equations for isotropic medium if @xmath53 .",
    "one can see that the electric field components fulfill different functions here .",
    "the ordinary component causes the quantum transitions , while the extraordinary one shifts its frequency .",
    "also , the same functions were executed by these components in works@xmath7 , where the system , which follows equations ( [ 14])([17 ] ) in the slowly varying envelope approximation , was considered .",
    "it is remarkable that the system of equations equivalent to ( [ 14])([17 ] ) appeared in the acoustics .",
    "namely , the propagation of the transverse - longitudinal acoustic pulses in a crystal containing paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath0 in a direction parallel to the external magnetic field is described by next equations ( see@xmath54 ) : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 are dimensionless variables defining transverse and longitudinal components of the acoustic pulse , respectively ; @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are expressed through the elements of the density matrix of the paramagnetic impurities ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 are dimensionless spatial and retarded time variables ; constant @xmath68 is defined through the coupling constants of the spin - phonon interaction ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 are linear velocities of the transverse and longitudinal acoustic waves , respectively ; @xmath71 is the frequency of the zeeman splitting of the kramers s doublets ; @xmath72 is the concentration of the paramagnetic impurities ; @xmath73 is the mean crystal density ; @xmath74 is the component of the lande tensor ; @xmath75 is the coupling constant of the spin - phonon interaction .",
    "the variables of both systems are connected by relations : @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79    complete integrability of equations ( [ 22])([26 ] ) in the frameworks of the inverse scattering transformation method@xmath3 in the case , when the linear velocities of transverse and longitudinal acoustic waves are equal , was established in paper@xmath80 .",
    "consequently , system ( [ 14])([17 ] ) is also integrable if @xmath81 .",
    "let us begin with system ( [ 14])([17 ] ) . at first , we suppose that the refractive indices of the medium are equal : @xmath82 . as it was noted at the end of previous section ,",
    "system we deal with is integrable by inverse scattering transformation method in this case , and its multisoliton solutions can be obtained by means of the algebraic methods of the soliton theory . the darboux transformation@xmath83 technique can be used for constructing these solutions , for instance . since the one - soliton solution is stationary , it can be found by direct integration of equations ( [ 14])([17 ] ) .",
    "after straightforward calculations , one reveals that there can exist two families of the one - soliton solutions .",
    "these families are distinguished by the domains on the spectral parameter plane , in which the points of the discrete spectrum of the solution spectral data lie .",
    "solution of the first family has next form : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 is an initial population of the quantum level ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "free parameter of this solution is real constant @xmath92 .",
    "it is assumed here that parameter @xmath92 takes the values such that condition @xmath93 holds .",
    "this condition is true with arbitrary @xmath92 , if @xmath94 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "parameter @xmath92 has to satisfy constraint @xmath96    in the case @xmath97 , the one - soliton solution is written as follows @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 this solution belongs to the second family of the one - soliton solutions",
    ". it can exist only if @xmath95 . also , the parameter @xmath92 value is such that @xmath102 the well - known one - soliton solution of the reduced maxwell ",
    "bloch equations@xmath42 is obtained from formulas ( [ 31])([34 ] ) if we put @xmath103 .",
    "it is seen from equations ( [ 19 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) that there exists asymmetry on the polarity of the extraordinary component of the pulse electric field : signs of @xmath12 and pdm are opposite .",
    "similar asymmetry was found in@xmath7 for two - component pulses , in which the ordinary component has slowly varying envelope .",
    "the number of peaks of variable @xmath104 of the second family solution depends on parameter @xmath92 . if @xmath105 it has two peaks , while at @xmath106 only single peak exists .",
    "one can show that a degree of the medium excitation grows with increase of @xmath107 for the first one - soliton solution family and , on the contrary , with decrease of @xmath107 for second one .",
    "the full inversion of the quantum level population can take place only if @xmath108 .",
    "the curves of variables @xmath104 and @xmath109 of the first and second families of one - soliton solution are presented on figs 1 , 2 and fig .",
    "3 , respectively .",
    "the distance between the peaks of @xmath104 depends on parameter @xmath92 and can take an arbitrary value if @xmath95 ( see curves on figs  2a and 3a ) .",
    "if @xmath110 , there exists an upper limit of this distance that corresponds to fig .",
