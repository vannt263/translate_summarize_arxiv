    "4c+73.18 ( 1928 + 738 ) is an extremely core - dominated , super - luminal quasar at a redshift of 0.302 .",
    "it is a flat - spectrum radio source in the s5 survey ( khr 1981 ) , which has been well studied with vlbi and shows unusual jet properties . on arc - second ( kpc )",
    "scales , the source exhibits two - sided curved jets , lobes , and a dominant core ( johnston 1987 , hummel 1992 , murphy 1993 ) . on pc scales , vlbi observations of the core reveal an one - sided jet , which exhibits apparent super - luminal motion with @xmath1 ( eckart 1985 , witzel et al .  1988 ) .",
    "the jet is estimated to be aligned within @xmath2 to the line - of - sight ( e.g.  ghisellini 1993 , jiang 1998 ) .",
    "no @xmath3-ray emission was detected by egret ( fichtel 1994 ) .",
    "to explain the mis - alignment between the vlbi jet and the kpc - scale jet , hummel ( 1992 ) suggested that the observed vlbi jet might be only one of the doppler - boosted filaments .",
    "interestingly , the most recent results from the space vlbi ( vsop ) monitoring of 4c+73.18 reveal substantial jet bending at a distance of 6.3pc from the core , and dramatic temporal variations of the bend angle over a few months ( murphy et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "it is intriguing that the sub - milliarcsec jet exhibits ballistic motion along a sinusoidal curve with a period of about 3 years ( hummel  1992 ) .",
    "the wiggles over such short period were modeled by roos ( 1993 ) as the orbital motion of a binary black hole system , which has a mass of the order of @xmath4 , a mass ratio @xmath5 , and a separation of @xmath6 cm .",
    "no other observational evidence for the binary black hole model has been reported so far .",
    "x - ray observations , having the advantage of looking into the region closed to the black hole , provide a potential tool to find signatures of binary black holes .    in the x - ray band , 4c+73.18 has been observed previously by _ einstein _",
    "( biermann et al .  1981 ) , _ exosat _ ( biermann 1992 , ghosh & soundararajaperumal 1992 ) , ginga ( lawson & turner 1997 ) , and by rosat in the survey ( voges et al .",
    "1999 ) and pointed observations with pspc ( brunner 1994 , and sambruna 1997 ) and hri , respectively .",
    "the measured spectra were generally described by a power law . of particular interest",
    "is the detection of a significant iron k@xmath7 emission line in the ginga observation , making this object one of the few flat - spectrum radio quasars showing iron k@xmath7 line .",
    "furthermore , the rosat data seem to suggest an absorption column in excess of the galactic value .    in this paper",
    ", we report on results of an x - ray observation of 4c+73.18 in the 0.810kev band performed by the asca satellite .",
    "the spectral and temporal analysis of the data are presented in  2 and 3 , respectively . a re - analysis of the archival rosat pspc spectrum is also given (  [ spec : rosat ] ) .",
    "we discuss the implications of the results and summarize the main conclusions in  4 and  5 , respectively .",
    "errors are quoted at 68% level throughout the paper , unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "4c+73.18 was observed with asca ( tanaka et al .",
    "1994 ) on 12 august , 1997 .",
    "the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) was operated in 1-ccd faint mode .",
    "the data reduction and spectral analysis was performed using ftools ( v.4.2 ) and xspec ( v.10 ) , respectively .",
    "we used the ` bright  2 ' mode data for sis with the corrections for dark frame error and echo effect applied .",
    "after removing hot and flickering pixels , the data screening was performed in the standard way using the following criteria : an elevation angle of @xmath8 , a magnetic cutoff rigidity of 6gev / c , and bright earth angles of @xmath9 for the sis0 and @xmath10 for the sis1 .",
    "the effective exposures for good data interval were 16.8/17.6ksec for the sis0/1 and 17.8ksec for the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) .",
    "the source counts were extracted from circular regions of @xmath11 and 6 arcmin radius for sis and gis , respectively .",
    "the background counts were determined in two ways , from blank sky observations at the same region of the detector and from a ` local ' off - source region of the same observation ( at the same off - axis position with the same radius as the source region in the case of gis ) .",
    "the count rates of the two kinds of background data agree with each other within about 10% relative errors . in the analysis we always used both backgrounds and compared the results but only those obtained by using blank sky data",
    "are presented here , for they have a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the averaged net source count rates of the sis1/2 and gis3/4 are 0.14cts / s and 0.13cts / s , respectively . the spectra of both the two gis and sis detectors were combined in the spectral fits .",
    "we therefore used pure poissonian errors for the counts in each bin for the combined spectrum .",
    "this might slightly overestimate the resulting @xmath12 of the fits since systematic uncertainties were not taken into account ; however , for relatively weak sources , the uncertainties were dominanted by photon statistics .",
    "] and re - binned to have at least 30 counts in each energy bin .        due to the increasing degradation of the response at low energies",

    "( ikebe , private communication ) .",
    "a simultaneous single power law fit to the combined sis and gis spectra is not acceptable ( see table1 ) either for free or for fixed galactic absorption ( @xmath16@xmath17 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "noticeable deviations from a power law can be seen from the residuals in fig.[fig : one - pl ] ( a ) and ( b ) , which show a spectral hardening above 6kev and a line - like feature around 1.3kev . even ignoring the 1.11.5kev data which covers the line - like feature yielded no acceptable fits . repeating the same fits ( fixing at the galactic value ) to the 210 , 310 , and 410kev band data gave progressively flattening photon indices",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively ) , indicative of a curved spectral shape in the 0.810kev band ( 113kev in the quasar frame ) .",
    "this suggests composite spectral models , i.e. a power law plus a soft x - ray component .",
    "the integrated 210kev flux is @xmath21 , using the mean value of the sis and gis measurements , which corresponds to a k - corrected luminosity of @xmath22ergs@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "no emission line features were seen at the iron k@xmath25 line energy .",
    "the 90% upper limits on the equivalent width of a 6.4kev line ranges from 62 to 112ev ( source rest frame ) for line - widths ranging from 0.01 to 0.5kev .",
    "we have tried the following models for the soft x - ray component : power law ( pl ) , blackbody ( bb ) , disk - blackbody ( dbb ) , and thermal plasma ( rs , raymond - smith in xspec ) .",
    "the results are summarized in table1 except for dbb models .",
    "the listed temperatures are in the quasar rest frame . in general , the addition of a soft component improves the fits significantly ( @xmath2616 , 16 , 17 , 19 for pl , bb , dbb , rs , respectively ) ; yet the fits remain relatively poor . ignoring the 1.11.5kev line - like feature",
    "improved the fits slightly and made them marginally acceptable , with a significance level @xmath27 0.11 for pl , 0.13 for bb , 0.16 for dbb , 0.25 for rs , respectively .",
    "thus , the current data are insufficient to impose strong constraints on the spectral form of the soft x - ray component , given the degrading sis low energy response .",
    "on the other hand , as will be discussed below , it is also possible that none of the above models is a good representation of the real spectral shape .",
    "the thermal plasma model yields the minimal @xmath12 and in good agreement with the galactic value , but , implausibly low metal abundances and a much flatter photon index than the ` canonical value ' @xmath28 for flat - spectrum radio quasars .",

    "however , neither an absorption edge nor a notch line fits the data .      to check the consistency of the spectral models derived from asca with previous observations , we re - analyzed the archival spectrum of the pspc pointed observation of 4c+73.18 .",
    "a power law with neutral absorption model yields a steep photon index ( @xmath101 ) and absorption significantly higher than the galactic value ( table1 ) .",
    "fixing at the galactic value gives an unacceptable fit ( @xmath102 ) and a flatter index .",
    "these results are in agreement with those given in brunner et al .  (",
    "1994 ) and sambruna ( 1997 ) . in light of the asca spectral modeling",
    ", we added a soft x - ray component and performed the same fits as in  [ spec : asca ] .",
    "the results are given in table[tab : spec_fit ] .",
    "considering the narrow pspc bandpass , we first fix the photon index of the hard power law at @xmath103 . adding a blackbody or thermal plasma model both yields the best fits , with @xmath104 and @xmath105kev ( source frame ) , respectively , and an consistent with the galactic value .",
    "fixing at the galactic value and setting @xmath33 as a free parameter gives @xmath106 for the thermal plasma and @xmath107 for the blackbody model , respectively .",
    "the fits are insensitive to the metal abundances , and the best fit value is @xmath108 solar .",
    "the excess absorption suggested previously is not required , which apparently resulted from fitting a single power law to the steepening part of the curved spectrum toward low energies .    no emission line like feature",
    "is seen around 1.25kev in the rosat spectrum .",
    "however , the poor energy resolution ( 40% at 1kev ) makes the pspc insensitive to such a weak line . the upper limit on the equivalent width of a narrow emission line at 1.25kev is found to be 74.5ev at 90% confidence , which is consistent with the asca data .      the asca spectra exhibit a concave curvature which flattens toward high energies .",
    "models composed of a power law and a soft x - ray excess improve the fits significantly , though the spectral shape of the soft component is inconclusive",
    ". such models also fit the previous rosat spectrum well , hence the soft x - ray excess in 4c+73.18 seems to be persistent , rather than a transient emission feature .",
    "no significant excess x - ray absorption is indicated .",
    "no iron k@xmath25 line is detected .",
    "a weak emission line like feature at 1.25kev is present in both , the sis and gis spectra , though the significance is not high .",
    "it should be noted that the asca spectra are ` noisy ' above 2kev , and the spectral fits are relatively poor in general .",
    "this may result , at least partly , from source variability as shown below .",
    "x - ray light curves were extracted from the source region and binned with a bin size of 96min ( one asca orbit ) for both the sis and gis detectors .",
    "the background count rates , estimated from the source free region and normalized to the source region , were subtracted . plotted in fig[fig : vari_flux ] are the light curves from the sis detectors only .",
    "small amplitude , but statistically significant flux variations in the 0.510kev band are found ( @xmath12 test , see table[tab : vari ] ) over the @xmath109ksec observation . as shown above , the x - rays in the asca band",
    "are likely composed of a hard power law , a soft component dominating below 1kev , and a tentative reflection component above 7kev ( 9kev in the source frame ) .",
    "we divided the asca energy band into three corresponding bands , i.e.   a low ( 0.51kev ) , a medium ( 16kev ) , and a high ( 610kev ) band .",
    "the light curves in fig.[fig : vari_flux ] show different temporal variations in the medium band ( the power law component ) from those in the low and high bands .",
    "the medium band flux reveals significantly more variability than the whole band ( @xmath110 ) , whereas the low and high energy band fluxes are consistent with no variations ( table[tab : vari ] ) .",
    "we checked the significance of the relative variations between different bands by testing the constancy of their counts ratios , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the probabilities for the @xmath12 tests are listed in table[tab : vari ] .",
    "non - synchronized variations between the medium and low , and the medium and high bands , however , can not be confirmed .",
    "this is likely due to the poor photon statistics in the low and high bands , as well as to the contribution from the underlying power law flux in these two bands .",
    "the gis light curves show very similar variations ; however , the large counting errors due to the higher background level makes the gis insensitive to variability with such small amplitudes .",

    "we conclude that the observed short time scale flux variability in is mainly attributable to variations of the hard band power law .",
    "the variability time scale is not obtainable from the relatively short observation interval ; however , it could be of the order of the duration of the observation , i.e.  10 hours in the source frame .",
    "no statistically significant variations are found for the flux in the 0.11kev band .",
    "this result is supported by the lack of variations of the flux in the 0.12.4kev pspc band on similar time scales during the rosat observation ( @xmath115 for 37 d.o.f .",
    ", brunner et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the uncorrelated , energy dependent flux variations are consistent with the above models of multi - component x - ray emission .",
    "we present in fig.[fig : hist_lc ] the long - term x - ray light curve of 4c+73.18 , compiled from the flux densities at 1kev from previous missions .",
    "the estimated ginga flux is an extrapolation of the observed 210kev spectrum and , as discussed below , should be taken as an upper limit due to possible flux contamination from nearby sources .",
    "the light curve tends to suggest an overall increase of the 1kev flux density by a factor of 50% over 18 years of observations .",
    "in addition , prominent flux variations in the hard x - ray band were reported from the _ exosat _ observations : the 210kev flux varied by a factor of 23 ( from 1.55.1@xmath116 ) on a time scale of about one month ( ghosh & soundararajaperumal 1992 ) .",
    "as mentioned by brunner ( 1994 , quoting a private communication ) there are indications for a cluster of galaxies around 4c+73.18 , which would affect the x - ray spectrum determined from instruments with limited spatial resolution .",
    "to investigate the possible role played by an extended x - ray emission component , we fitted a point source plus a @xmath117-model ( e.g. gorenstein et al . 1978 ) of the form @xmath118 to the surface brightness profile of the rosat hri source ( with an exposure of 38660sec ) .",
    "the result is inconclusive ; however , a noticeable contribution from a cluster at a flux level greater than a few percent in the hri energy band can be ruled out .    in the hard x - ray band ( 0.810kev ) , no evidence for extended emission is found in the asca gis image .",
    "moreover , no iron k@xmath25 emission line is detected in the asca spectra .",
    "it should be noted that the gis source extraction radius of 6arcmin corresponds to @xmath94mpc at the quasar distance , which is about 23 times the typical x - ray core radius and hence may well encompass the x - ray emitting region of the host cluster . taking the typical value of 1kev for the equivalent width of the iron k@xmath25 line of cluster emission , the derived @xmath119ev places an upper limit on the flux density of a host cluster of being 7% of the quasar flux at about 5kev in the observer frame .",
    "thus , we do not find evidence for noticeable x - ray emission from a host cluster of galaxies .",
    "one of the interesting results of this work is the non - detection of the iron k@xmath25 line , which was previously reported from the ginga observation ( lawson & turner 1997 ) .",
    "the upper limits of the equivalent width is estimated to be 62ev , in contrast to the measured @xmath120ev by ginga .",
    "moreover , the spectrum ( @xmath121 ) is steeper and the flux ( @xmath122 ) higher for ginga than for the asca observations ( @xmath123 and flux @xmath124 ) in the 210kev band .",
    "the difference of the two continuum spectra can be seen clearly in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "there are two possible explanations to this observed discrepancy , namely , either genuine spectral variations of both the iron line and continuum , or contamination of the ginga spectrum by other sources .",
    "we consider the latter to be more plausible , based on the following arguments .",
    "it is rare for blazar - type radio quasars to show iron line emission ( e.g.  siebert et al .",
    "1996 , lawson & turner 1997 , reeves et al .",
    "1997 , cappi et al .",
    "x - ray monitoring of 3c273 also revealed that the iron line was detected in only some but not all of the observations .",
    "this effect seems to be dependent on variations of the continuum rather than of the line flux  at a high continuum flux , the line equivalent width decreases or the line is even swamped ( e.g.  turner et al .  1990 ,",
    "cappi et al .",
    "however , this was not the case for 4c+73.18 during the ginga observation ( see below for a discussion on the ginga flux ) . if the line did come from the quasar , there must be a variation of the line itself .",
    "this may suggest that during the ginga observation seyfert like emission from the central agn was substantially enhanced while the jet emission dimmed since no significant changes were found for the overall flux level .",
    "given the large field of view ( fov ) of @xmath125 ( fwhm ) and poor energy resolution of ginga , the association of the detected line with the quasar , and even the presence of the line , may be questionable .",
    "we examined x - ray sources in the vicinity of 4c+73.18 which may have fallen into the fov of the ginga observation . within the gis fov",
    "there is another source detected at a distance of 12arcmin from the quasar ; however , the flux in the ginga energy band is too low ( @xmath126 ) to make considerable contribution to the observed ginga flux .",
    "we next analyzed the data of rosat pspc pointed observation of 4c+73.18 , whose @xmath127 fov covers a large portion of the ginga fov . among 27",
    "x - ray sources detected ( with a detection likelihood larger than 10 ) in addition to 4c+73.18 , we found one source of particular interest .",
    "the source is located 43arcmin away from the quasar and inside the ginga fwhm field of view ( yamagisi , private communication ) .",
    "it is bright ( 0.1 countss@xmath23 in the 0.12.4kev band40% of the count rate of the quasar ) and extended ( 4 times of the fwhm of the point spread function ) .",
    "this source has been selected from the rosat all - sky survey as a candidate of , and later confirmed in optical to be , a cluster of galaxies ( boehringer et al .",
    "2000 ) . the rosat spectrum , which is of poor photon statistics , can be fitted with thermal bremsstrahlung emission , and the temperature seems to be higher than 3kev . though the redshift is unknown , we suggest this x - ray cluster as a likely source of the emission line detected by ginga .    as a self - consistency check",
    ", we compare the line intensity predicted for the cluster with the observed value .",
    "the observed line flux by ginga is @xmath128photons@xmath23@xmath17 and the line energy @xmath129kev ( observer frame ) . assuming a cluster temperature of 6kev and extrapolating the fitted rosat spectrum to higher energies",
    ", we expect that ginga would detect a line flux of @xmath130photons@xmath23@xmath17 , where @xmath131 is the line equivalent width ( in units of kev , in the source frame ) and @xmath132 the ginga off - center detection efficiency at the source position ( @xmath133 in this case ) . for a redshift close to that of the quasar , @xmath134",
    ", we have @xmath135 ( @xmath88photons@xmath23@xmath17 ) , which is compatible with the observed value for a range of line equivalent width from several hundred ev to 1kev . in this case",
    ", the measured ginga line energy implies that the cluster is at a redshift range 0.23 @xmath136 0.36 for a 6.7kev k@xmath25 line .",
    "however , no firm conclusion can be drawn on the origin of the line until the redshift of the cluster is available .",
    "the estimated continuum flux from the cluster , using the above parameters , is @xmath137 in 210kev , which may account for the measured flux excess for ginga over the asca measurement .",
    "further , though the rest of the sources in the pspc fov are too faint and soft to be considerable contributors to the observed ginga flux , they may account for the steepening of the ginga spectrum in the soft x - rays",
    ". the total pspc count rate of sources in the vicinity of 4c+73.18 turned out to be @xmath138counts   s@xmath23 , 1.3 times higher than that of quasar itself .",
    "thus we suggest that the excess fluxes of the ginga observation over those of rosat and asca in the soft and medium x - ray band ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) could be , at least partly , accounted for by emission from the cluster of galaxies and other nearby soft x - ray sources .",
    "the genuine x - ray flux of the quasar might be comparable with that of asca and rosat , though quantitative estimates can only be obtained by detailed modeling .",
    "the presence of an excess flux at energies below @xmath13kev over the extrapolation of the hard band spectrum is evident from the curved spectrum in the asca band and the uncorrelated variations in the soft ( 0.51kev ) and hard ( 16kev ) band .",
    "the latter was also reported from the _ exosat _ observations ( ghosh & soundararajaperumal 1992 ) .",
    "however , the spectral shape of the soft excess is uncertain .",
    "we show in fig.[fig : sed ] the optical to x - ray energy distribution of 4c+73.18 , which is very similar to that of 3c273 . the optical - uv spectral shape , though with sparse data points , is suggestive of a prominent uv component which peaks at shortward 1300@xmath139 or above @xmath140hz ( the ` blue bump ' ) , and probably extends into the euv band .",
    "it is natural to regard the soft x - ray excess to be the high - energy tail of the uv bump , which results from compton up - scattering disk photons to higher energies by hot gas .",
    "when fitted with a thermal emission model , the temperature @xmath141 ( e.g.  0.4kev for blackbody ) is somewhat higher than those obtained in a few core - dominated radio quasars for which @xmath141 was relatively well determined , e.g.   @xmath142kev in 3c273 ( e.g.  turner 1990 , bhler 1994 , cappi 1998 ) .",
    "the higher @xmath141 could imply that the up - shift of the energy of disk photons is more pronounced in 4c+73.18 than in 3c273",
    ". the hot gas may be the skin - type coronae surrounding the accretion disks , as discussed in detail in , e.g. , czerny & elvis ( 1987 ) . in the czerny & elvis model",
    ", the high @xmath141 implies that the quasar is likely radiating at a luminosity around the eddington luminosity ( see fig.7 of czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "if this is true , a uv luminosity of the order @xmath143ergss@xmath23 ( see fig.[fig : sed ] ) implies a central mass of the order of @xmath144m@xmath145 in 4c+73.18 .",
    "this value is close to the mass of the binary black hole system ( @xmath146m@xmath145 ) estimated by roos et al .",
    "( 1993 ) by modeling the wiggles of the vlbi jet .",
    "other sources of the hot gas might be the base of the relativistic jet where it emerges from the accretion disk , as proposed by mannheim ( 1995 ) .",
    "these scenarios all require a small inclination angle of the disk ( or the jet , respectively ) to the observer , in agreement with the super - luminal motion observed in this source .",
    "finally , the result is consistent with the findings by brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the soft x - ray excess tends to be more significant in core - dominated than in lobe - dominated quasars .    in the soft x - ray band ,",
    "the spectral analyses in  2 indicate a higher temperature for the soft thermal component in the asca than in the rosat observations .",
    "this may well be a genuine spectral change , as the observations are about 6 years apart .",
    "the conclusion , however , must be drawn with caution due to the inter - instrument calibration uncertainties .",
    "there have been reports that the rosat pspc tends to give steeper spectra than asca , even within the overlapping bandpass ( e.g.  iwasawa et al .",
    "such an effect might play a role in comparing the temperatures derived from the two instruments .",
    "the observed flat power law continuum in the hard x - ray band is typical for flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars .",
    "the inferred time scale of variations of the power law continuum might be as short as of the order of hours .",
    "these factors , as well as the lack of an iron @xmath147 line , are typical signatures of the radio - jet - linked x - ray emission in radio - loud agn , which is strongly beamed by relativistic bulk motion .",
    "thus the asca observation provides strong evidence for the idea that the hard x - rays in 4c+73.18 are emitted predominantly from the jet ( via inverse compton scattering ) .",
    "such mechanism has been tested in detail in a few similar super - luminal quasars ( e.g.  3c345 , unwin 1994 ) .    to investigate the contribution of possible seyfert - like emission",
    ", we tried to include a steep power law ( fixing @xmath148 ) as well as reflection in the above fittings .",
    "no acceptable fits were obtained when a significant seyfert - like emission component was included .",
    "though , as shown in ",
    "[ spec : asca ] , including a reflection model can account for the tentative excess fluxes in the highest energy bins of the asca spectra , the addition of this component is not justified statistically by the data .",
    "given the lack of an iron line and that the continuum is dominated by beamed jet emission , a significant reflection component can not be physically justified either .",
    "a marginal , narrow line feature at 1.25kev is suggested to be present in 4c+73.18 .",
    "it is not clear from the current data whether this is a real line or an instrumental artifact , though the latter seems unlikely given that this feature appears in both the co - added sis and gis data at almost identical energies . if interpreted as associated with the quasar , the line energy corresponds to 1.63@xmath149 and 1.64@xmath150kev in the quasar frame for the sis and gis , respectively .",
    "no known emission lines have been found or are expected to be present around these energies .",
    "the closest line is the he - like mgxi transition at 1.58kev .",
    "interestingly enough , using asca data yaqoob ( 1998 ) reported the discovery of a peculiar narrow emission line ( @xmath151ev ) , which has never been seen in any other agn , in another flat - spectrum quasar pks0637 - 752 ( redshift 0.654 ) .",
    "the line energy in quasar frame is at 1.60@xmath150 , which is strikingly close to what we found in this work .",
    "therefore , the line - like feature in 4c+73.18 provided the first independent evidence for the presence of such an emission line , though the statistical significance of the presence of the line is low .",
    "it seems unlikely that the match of the line energies in two quasars with different redshifts is a coincidence .",
    "the identification of this line is , however , unknown ( see yaqoob 1998 for a discussion of the possibilities ) .",
    "if the emission line feature found in this work is real and identical to that of yaqoob ( 1998 ) , the obtained @xmath152kev should be the line energy in the rest frame , rather than a doppler - shifted value due to the in- or out - flow of the emitting gas .",
    "otherwise it is hard to explain why the bulk motions are exactly the same in the two quasars .",
    "the flat - spectrum , super - luminal quasar 4c+73.18 resembles the well studied , similar object 3c273 in some basic properties in the soft - to - medium x - ray band .",
    "rapid , small amplitude ( @xmath153 ) flux variations were detected in the 110kev band on a tentative time scale of the order of 10 hours , whereas no significant variations were found for the soft x - rays below 1kev .",
    "the 0.810kev spectrum exhibits a curvature , which can be modeled by a power law plus a soft component .",
    "both , the x - ray spectrum and the uncorrelated flux variations provide strong evidence for the presence of a soft x - ray excess over the extrapolation of the hard band power law , which might be the high - energy extension of the uv bump emission .",
    "the underlying continuum is flat , with a power law photon index of 1.11.5 , depending on the spectral model adopted for the soft component .",
    "the dominance of the flat power law over possible seyfert - like emission , together with the short time scale variability , are naturally explained by beaming models for the jet , which is estimated to be observed at an inclination angle about 10 degree .",
    "no iron k@xmath25 emission line is detected , in contrast to the significant line reported in a previous ginga observation , which is most likely contamination from another source .",
    "a weak emission line - like feature around 1.25kev ( 1.6kev in the quasar frame ) seems to be present in both the sis and gis spectra , though the significance is not high .",
    "the line energy is identical to that of a mysterious emission line in the flat - spectrum quasar pks0637 - 752 reported by yaqoob ( 1998 ) .",
