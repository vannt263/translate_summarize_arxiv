    "the internal structure of colliding nuclei strongly influences heavy - ion collisions at energies around the coulomb barrier .",
    "a well known example is a reaction of a deformed nucleus . in this case",
    ", the nucleus - nucleus potential depends on the orientation angle of the deformed nucleus with respect to the beam direction . assuming that the orientation angle does not change during the collision , the cross section",
    "can then be obtained by averaging the contribution from all possible angles @xcite . in this picture , the relative motion between the colliding nuclei experiences many distributed potential barriers depending on the orientation angle of the target nucleus , instead of a single barrier . to a good approximation",
    ", the concept of barrier distribution can be extended also to systems with a non - deformed target @xcite , where the distribution originates from the coupling between the relative motion and several intrinsic degrees of freedom such as collective inelastic excitations of the colliding nuclei and/or transfer processes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , rowley , satchler , and stelson argued that a barrier distribution can be directly extracted from a measured fusion excitation function @xmath2 , by taking the second derivative of the product @xmath3 with respect to the center - of - mass energy @xmath4 , that is , @xmath5 .",
    "this has stimulated many high precision measurements of fusion cross section , so that the second derivative is meaningful @xcite .",
    "the extracted barrier distributions have revealed that the concept indeed holds and the barrier distribution provides a nice tool to investigate the fusion dynamics of the entrance channel .",
    "it was also shown recently that the concept of barrier distribution still retains even in massive systems , such as @xmath6mo + @xmath6mo @xcite .",
    "a similar barrier distribution can be extracted also using the quasi - elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the quasi - elastic scattering is a sum of elastic , inelastic , transfer , and breakup processes , and is a good counterpart of heavy - ion fusion reaction @xcite .",
    "a major difference is that the quasi - elastic scattering is related to the reflection probability of the coulomb barrier , while the fusion is related to the transmission .",
    "since the penetration and reflection probabilities are related to each other due to the flux conservation , similar information can be obtained both from fusion and quasi - elastic scattering .    in this contribution , we discuss two recent theoretical activities on heavy - ion quasi - elastic scattering at sub - barrier energies .",
    "we first present our recent systematic analyses on heavy - ion quasi - elastic scattering at deep - subbarrier energies , in aiming at extracting the surface diffuseness parameter of inter - nuclear potential @xcite .",
    "we then discuss coupled - channels calculations for the @xmath0zn + @xmath1pb reaction , for which the quasi - elastic barrier distribution has recently been obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "before we proceed , let us first summarize the theoretical formulas for quasi - elastic barrier distribution . in the eigenchannel representation of the coupled - channels method ,",
    "the fusion and quasi - elastic cross sections are given as a weighted sum of the cross sections for uncoupled eigenchannels @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fusion and the elastic cross sections for a potential in the eigenchannel @xmath10 .",
    "notice that the same weight factors @xmath11 appear both in eqs .",
    "( [ crossfus ] ) and ( [ crossqel ] ) .",
    "this is a generalization of well - known orientation average formula for a system with deformed target , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the orientation of the deformed target and represents a continuous variable for @xmath10 in eqs .",
    "( [ crossfus ] ) and ( [ crossqel ] ) .",
    "the idea of barrier distribution is led by the fact that the classical cross sections for fusion and quasi - elastic scattering for a single potential barrier are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively@xcite . here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the barrier position and the barrier height for the @xmath18-wave scattering ( thus the scattering angle is set to be @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ el ] ) ) , respectively , and @xmath20 is the rutherford cross section .",
    "these yield @xcite , @xmath21 = \\sum_\\alpha w_\\alpha \\pi \\left[r^{(\\alpha)}_b\\right]^2\\,\\delta(e - v_b^{(\\alpha ) } ) ,   \\label{dfus}\\\\ d_{\\rm qel}(e)&\\equiv &   -\\frac{d}{de}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm el}(e,\\pi)}{\\sigma_r(e,\\pi)}\\right ) = \\sum_\\alpha w_\\alpha\\,\\delta(e - v_b^{(\\alpha ) } ) .   \\label{dqel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evidently , these functions provide information on how potential barrier heights are distributed , and are called fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions , respectively . in realistic situations ,",
    "the quantum ( tunneling ) effect smears the delta function in eqs .",
    "( [ dfus ] ) and ( [ dqel ] ) .",
    "moreover , the effect of nuclear potential has to be taken into account in quasi - elastic cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ dqel ] ) @xcite . nevertheless , from the derivation",
    ", it is apparent that the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions behave in a similar way .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath22o + @xmath23sm system .    in actual experiments ,",
    "it is impossible to put a detector at a scattering angle @xmath19 .",
    "one can , however , scale a cross section in energy by taking into account the centrifugal correction .",
    "estimating the centrifugal potential at the distance of closest approach for the rutherford scattering , @xmath24 , the effective energy may be expressed as @xcite @xmath25 therefore , one expects that the function @xmath26 evaluated at an angle @xmath27 will correspond to the quasi - elastic barrier distribution at the effective energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eeff ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the application of deep - subbarrier quasi - elastic scattering to the problem of surface diffuseness anomaly in heavy - ion potential @xcite . for calculations of elastic and inelastic scattering , which are sensitive only to the surface region of the nuclear potential ,",
    "the diffuseness parameter of around 0.63 fm has been conventionally employed @xcite .",
    "this value of surface diffuseness parameter has been well accepted , partly because it is consistent with a double folding potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a recent systematic study has shown that experimental data for heavy - ion fusion reactions require a much larger value of the diffuseness parameter , ranging between 0.75 and 1.5 fm , as long as the woods - saxon parameterization is employed @xcite .    since quasi - elastic scattering and fusion are complementary to each other , it is of interest to investigate this problem using quasi - elastic scattering . in doing so , we are particularly interested in the deep sub - barrier region @xcite . at these energies , the cross sections of ( quasi-)elastic scattering are close to the rutherford cross sections , with small deviations caused by the effect of nuclear interaction , @xmath28 .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by the semiclassical perturbation theory @xcite , which leads to @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the reduced mass .",
    "@xmath32 is the sommerfeld parameter , and @xmath24 is the distance of closest approach .",
    "this formula shows that the deviation of the elastic cross sections from the rutherford ones is sensitive predominantly to the surface region of the nuclear potential , especially to the surface diffuseness parameter @xmath33 .",
    "there is another advantage of using the deep sub - barrier data .",
    "that is , the effect of channel coupling on quasi - elastic scattering can be disregarded at these energies , since the reflection probability is almost unity irrespective of the presence of channel couplings @xcite . from these considerations , it is evident that the effect of surface diffuseness parameter can be studied in a transparent and unambiguous way using the large - angle quasi - elastic scattering at deep sub - barrier energies .     for the @xmath34s + @xmath35au ( the upper panel ) reaction and for the @xmath36s + @xmath35au ( the lower panel )",

    "figure 1 compares the experimental data with the calculated cross sections obtained with different values of the surface diffuseness parameter for the @xmath34s + @xmath35au system ( the upper panel ) and the @xmath36s + @xmath35au system ( the lower panel ) . in order to analyze the experimental data at deep sub - barrier energies",
    ", we use a one - dimensional optical potential with the woods - saxon form .",
    "absorption following transmission through the barrier is simulated by an imaginary potential that is well localized inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "the best fitted values for the surface diffuseness parameter are @xmath37 fm and @xmath38 fm for the @xmath34s and @xmath36s + @xmath35au reactions , respectively .",
    "the cross sections obtained with these surface diffuseness parameters are denoted by the solid line in the figure .",
    "the dotted and the dot - dashed lines are calculated with the diffuseness parameter of @xmath33 = 0.80 fm and @xmath33 = 1.00 fm , respectively .",
    "it is clear from the figure that these spherical systems favor the standard value of the surface diffuseness parameter , around @xmath39 0.60 fm .",
    "the calculations with the larger diffuseness parameters underestimate the quasi - elastic cross sections and are not consistent with the energy dependence of the experimental data .",
    "we obtain a similar conclusion for the @xmath40s + @xmath1pb and @xmath22o + @xmath1pb systems@xcite .",
    "this indicates that the double folding procedure is valid at least in the surface region and for spherical systems which we studied .    for deformed systems , such as @xmath22o + @xmath23sm , @xmath41w",
    ", on the other hand , we found that the surface diffuseness parameter of @xmath42 fm and 0.79 @xmath43 fm for the former and for the latter , respectively , is required in order to account for the experimental data @xcite .",
    "although these large values of surface diffuseness parameter are consistent with that extracted from fusion , the origin of the difference between the spherical and the deformed systems is not clear . in order to clarify the difference in the diffuseness parameter ,",
    "apparently further precision measurements for large - angle quasi - elastic scattering at deep sub - barrier energies are urged , especially for deformed systems .",
    "we next discuss the barrier distribution for synthesis of superheavy elements .",
    "when one discusses a fusion reaction to synthesize superheavy elements , one often refers to a single potential such as the bass barrier @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of channel coupling is in general strong for massive systems , and thus one can expect a broad distribution of potential barriers . it is thus important to study how the potential barrier is distributed for massive systems , since it is crucial to choose the right beam energy in order to effectively synthesize superheavy elements .",
    "moreover , there is no a priori evidence why the bass barrier is reasonable in the superheavy region . for these reasons ,",
    "the quasi - elastic barrier distribution measurements have been recently performed by mitsuoka _",

    "the deep - inelastic component has been subtracted from the experimental data using a statistical code , as is explained in ref .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the results of the coupled - channels and the potential model calculations , respectively .",
    "we use the woods - saxon potential with @xmath48 = 140 mev , @xmath49 = 1.186 fm , and @xmath33 = 0.69 fm for the real part and @xmath50 = 50.0 mev , @xmath51 = 1.0 fm , and @xmath52 = 0.1 fm for the imaginary part . in the coupled - channels calculation , we include the double quadrupole phonon excitations in the @xmath0zn and the triple octupole phonon excitations in the @xmath1pb nucleus . in addition , we include the mutual excitation channels , [ 1,1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,1 ] , and [ 2,2 ] , where [ @xmath53,@xmath54 denotes the excitation channel with @xmath53 phonon state in the projectile and @xmath55 phonon state in the target nucleus . in this way , we include 10 channels ( including the entrance channel , [ 0,0 ] ) in the calculations . the excitation energy for the single phonon state and the deformation parameter are @xmath56 = 0.885 mev and @xmath57 = 0.228 for the projectile nucleus @xmath0zn and @xmath58 = 2.614 mev and @xmath59 = 0.11 for the target nucleus @xmath1pb .",
    "we use @xmath49 = 1.2 fm for the coupling term .    in the code ,",
    "the coupled - channels equations are solved by constructing @xmath60 linear independent solutions of the equations , where @xmath60 is the dimension of the coupled - channels equations . a linear superposition of these solutions",
    "is then taken to construct the physical solution , which fulfills the asymptotic boundary condition for scattering . for massive systems , it is sometimes difficult to numerically maintain the linear independence of the solutions , since the wave functions scale very differently from one channel to another .",
    "this leads to a numerical instability of the solution of the coupled - channels equations .",
    "we avoid this difficulty by taking a linear superposition of the solutions at several places , with an interval of 1 fm up to 15 fm , so that the linear independence is recovered .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "even though we use this prescription , we still find a small spurious oscillation in the calculated excitation function of quasi - elastic cross section due to the numerical inaccuracy , when the coupling is strong .",
    "we therefore average the calculated cross sections with a gaussian weight with 0.5 mev width .",
    "we have checked that the shape of quasi - elastic barrier distribution is insensitive to the value of the width parameter .",
    "as we can see in the figure , the potential model calculation ( the dashed line ) significantly underestimate the quasi - elastic cross sections at energies above the coulomb barrier . also , the barrier distribution has a significantly narrow width , and is inconsistent with the experimental data . on the other hand ,",
