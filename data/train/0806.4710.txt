    "we investigate the possibility of extending the elementary length operator for a wedge to a length operator for an elementary curve dual to a plaquette , @xmath120 .",
    "+ thanks to the results of section [ sec : commutators ] , we know that length operators associated to different wedges belonging to the same plaquette commute",
    ". therefore they can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "moreover , as they commute with the area operator , we can choose a specific configuration for the spin labels .",
    "let s start considering the particular situation when all the links of @xmath28 ending at a node of the plaquette are labelled by spins which are all equal to @xmath121 .",
    "a simultaneous eigenstate of all the operators @xmath122 can be easily found .",
    "we simply have to choose at each node of the plaquette one of the @xmath123 intertwiners @xmath124 which diagonalizes the @xmath125 matrix @xmath126 . in this way we have defined a spin  network state which is a simultaneous eigenstate of each of the operators @xmath122 to eigenvalues @xmath127 which are in general different .",
    "from the point of view of the cellular decomposition @xmath128 this means that this state describes a quantum geometry such that the curve dual to the plaquette @xmath129 has a different length when seen from different wedges .",
    "this fact has a flavor which is very close to the simplicial discontinuous - metrics discussed in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of imposing a _ continuous - metrics condition _ can be considered .",
    "for instance if in the spin  network state described above we choose the same intertwiner @xmath130 in each of the nodes of the plaquette , then we have that the curve @xmath119 has the same length @xmath131 when seen from different wedges .",
    "let s call this state @xmath132 . in this case the continuous - metrics condition would involve all the nodes belonging to the plaquette , not simply single nodes .",
    "in this sense it can be called a _ local _ condition , but not an ultralocal one .    notice that for general fixed spins @xmath29 labelling the links of @xmath28 , the spectra of the matrices @xmath133 , .. , @xmath134 do not match .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spectrum for the wedge @xmath135 depends on the spins labelling the links which end at the node @xmath0 and different wedges of the plaquette may have different spins . in this case",
    "the requirement of a matching of eigenvalues is highly non - trivial and in general can not be satisfied .",
    "however , this does not mean that an operator @xmath120 properly associated to the length of the curve dual to the plaquette @xmath129 can not be introduced .",
    "in fact the operator has to be defined on the hilbert space @xmath35 and not on a subspace with prescribed spins on the links .",
    "this suggests that an operator @xmath120 satisfying the continuous - metrics condition can be introduced , that it acts locally on the plaquette both on spins and intertwiners and that the @xmath123 states @xmath132 described above are eigenstates of @xmath120 .",
    "a second milder possibility is to impose the continuous - metrics condition only on semiclassical states . with respect to the discussion of section [ sec : semiclassical ] , this amounts to add to the semiclassicality requirements ( a ) and ( b ) the third requirement ( c ) that the expectation value of length operators for different wedges belonging to the same plaquette match .",
    "notice that in order to satisfy ( a ) and ( b ) an ` ultralocal ' superposition of spin  network states is enough .",
    "that is we have a product of coefficients @xmath136 as in ( [ eq:|c > ] ) , one for each node and not relatively constrained . in order to satisfy ( c )",
    "too we need a superposition which is _ local _ with respect to the plaquette but in general not ultralocal .",
    "the superposition over intertwiners labeling nodes of the plaquette may be required to be of a non - product ( or entangled ) form or more simply to be a product of non - independent coefficients .",
    "these issues clearly deserve further work .",
    "finally we describe how to define the length operator for an ` extended ' curve @xmath5 embedded in the @xmath22-manifold @xmath24 out of the ` elementary ' length operator discussed in section [ sec : properties ] .",
    "we make use of the framework set at the beginning of this section and ultimately of the dual picture of quantum geometry described at the very beginning of this paper in section [ sec : picture ] .",
    "+ the idea is to introduce a length operator which measures the length of a curve belonging to the dual  network .",
    "we recall that starting from the spin  network graph @xmath28 we can identify a cellular decomposition @xmath128 of the @xmath22-manifold @xmath24 which is dual to the graph @xmath28 .",
    "a curve belonging to the dual  network is simply defined as a path on the @xmath137-skeleton of @xmath128 . in the language of the soapfilm - like @xmath116-complex @xmath117 , it is a curve which goes from bubble to bubble crossing common faces of the bubbles .",
    "such curve is the composition of elementary curves , @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we can attempt to use the ` elementary ' length operator to define the length of the extended curve as a sum of elementary lengths in a fashion analogous to what is done for the volume operator    given the discussion of the previous subsection , we have to declare if we are attempting to impose a continuous - metrics condition or not .",
    "even if the possibility of imposing such condition can be considered , in the following we will avoid relying on it .",
    "therefore , when discussing the length of the curve @xmath5 , we have to tell from which wedge the portion @xmath118 is seen .",
    "we will indicate it explicitly writing @xmath5 in terms of @xmath139 for wedges . within the dual picture given by the cellular complex @xmath128 , what we have to give is the curve @xmath5 together with a tube of @xmath22-cells which contains @xmath5 on its boundary .",

    "we have that , in order to define the length operator @xmath142 as a sum of @xmath143 , the elementary length operators @xmath144 have to be compatible observables .",
    "as the length operators for two wedges @xmath145 , @xmath146 sharing a node do not commute ( see section [ sec : commutators ] ) , we have that only a specific class of nice curves can be considered . within the dual picture",

    ", for a four - valent node we have a @xmath22-cell @xmath14 with the topology of a tetrahedron and two opposite edges of the tetrahedron do not intersect .    for the class of nice curves described above",

    "an elementary attempt to quantize general relativity in the connection representation would lead to an electric field operator acting as a functional derivative @xmath154 within such framework , promoting a classical geometrical quantity like the volume of a region ( see equation [ eq : vol ] ) to a quantum operator appears out of hope . from this perspective , the fact that  in the loop approach  geometric operators corresponding to areas and volumes can be introduced and studied is a highly non - trivial result . in this paper",
    "we have introduced in loop quantum gravity a new geometric operator  the length operator . as for the area and for the volume",
    ", the length operator turns out to have a discrete spectrum .",
    "we have avoided entering into the difficult issue of observability of such spectrum .",
    "we refer to @xcite for perspectives and to @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "the operator is constructed starting from the classical expression ( [ eq : classical l])([eq : classical g ] ) for the length of a curve .",
    "the quantization procedure goes through an _",
    "external _ regularization of the classical quantity , a canonical quantization of the regularized expression and an analysis of the existence of the limit in the hilbert space topology .",
    "the operator constructed in this way has a number of properties which are discussed in sections [ sec : properties ] and [ sec : extended length ] .",
    "let s highlight some of them :    * the length operator fits into the dual picture of quantum geometry proper of loop quantum gravity .",
    "more in detail , for given spin  network graph , the operator measures the length of a curve in the dual  graph .",
    "* an ` elementary ' length operator can be introduced .",
    "it measures the length of a curve defined in the following intrinsic way .",
    "a node of the spin  network graph is dual to a region of space and a couple of links at such node are dual to two surfaces which intersect at a curve .",
    "the ` elementary ' length operator measures the length of this curve . *",
    "the ` elementary ' length operator has a discrete spectrum .",
    "a number of eigenstates and eigenvalues computed algebraically and numerically are presented in section [ sec : spectrum ] . *",
    "the ` elementary ' length operator has non - trivial commutators with other geometric operators , as shown in section [ sec : commutators ] . *",
    "a semiclassical analysis has been performed .",
    "it shows that the ` elementary ' length operator has the appropriate semiclassical behaviour : on a state peaked on the geometry of a classical tetrahedron it measures the length of one of its edges .",
    "* for given spin  network graph , the length operator for a curve in the dual  graph can be written in terms of a sum of ` elementary ' length operators . *",
    "the analysis of the length of a curve in the dual graph shows that the geometry described by a spin  network state is in general discontinuous .",
    "the possibility of identifying states which describe a continuous geometry is discussed in section [ sec : continuous - metric ] .",
    "* the length operators for two curves in the dual  network do not commute if the two curves come close to intersecting .",
    "there remains still much to be done .",
    "mainly , an analysis of the extension of the operator to the full hilbert space @xmath27 , a study of the continuous - metrics condition of section [ sec : continuous - metric ] and an investigation of its consequences on the semiclassical behaviour of loop quantum gravity .",
