    "our phase - referenced image of j1502s shows that it consists of two radio sources , as reported by d14 , with a summed flux density of less than 2 mjy .",
    "this image was used to self - calibrate the phases of the j1502 + 1115 data . because j1502s is so faint , the phase - only self - calibration was based on data coherently averaged for 35  m over all frequencies and both polarizations .",
    "this long coherent average was possible because the initial phase referencing had already removed the short - term phase fluctuations .",
    "this phase self - calibration was used to reduce residual systematic calibration offsets . for j1502s ,",
    "the improved calibration recovered an additional @xmath10 10% in the peak flux densities and @xmath10 5% in the integrated flux densities .",
    "self - calibration at low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) can adjust the flux density upwards excessively by gathering noise , or downward by failing to calibrate the residual phase fluctuations . to account for these effects , our experiments with several coherent averages",

    "the data used for imaging retained the 0.5-mhz channels from the correlator to prevent bandwidth smearing , and had its phase center shifted by @xmath111.329 in right ascension and 0.330 in declination .",
    "j1502p was detected as a slightly resolved source in both images , with the self - calibration providing a 9% enhancement in the peak flux density and no change in the integrated flux density .",
    "the signal from j1502p did not enter into the self - calibration , so this is an independent check of the quality of that calibration .",
    "an elliptical gaussian fit in the image plane was consistent with j1502p being unresolved with major and minor axes less than 3.5 mas and 1.5 mas , respectively .",
    "since j1502p is so point - like , no image is presented .",
    "from evn images at 1.7 and 5  ghz , d14 reported evidence that the dust - obscured agn exhibits two flat - spectrum radio sources , j1502se / sw , offset by 26 mas ( 140 pc ) , with each source being energized by its own supermassive bh .",
    "while intriguing , this interpretation of a close binary bh hole was adopted only after d14 had ruled out a more prosaic double - hotspot scenario . in a double - hotspot scenario both hotspots are energized by a single , central bh .",
    "such a configuration occurs in a well - studied class of radio - selected agn , the csos ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "csos have radio extents of less than 1 kpc ; slow - moving emission on both sides of the central engine ; and weak , if any , radio variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when observed with sufficient sensitivity and resolution , the overall structure of a cso can appear edge - brightened , that is , the emission is brightest at the cso s extremities , called hotspots , and becomes fainter closer to its central bh .",
    "the radio sources j1502se / sw were only slightly resolved in the evn images , making it difficult to look for edge - brightening .",
    "however , the vlba image in figure 1 clearly shows the expected edge - brightened structure for j1502se / sw .",
    "for this reason , we conclude that the double - hotspot scenario should be reconsidered as a viable interpretation for j1502se / sw .    when compared to csos in the compilation of @xcite , d14 noted that j1502se / sw has several unusual properties , including an atypically low spectral power of @xmath12 w hz@xmath1 and an atypically flat spectral index of @xmath13 , especially given its projected linear size .",
    "these properties provide important clues as to the nature of j1502sw / se .",
    "below , we discuss these properties within an alternate , and yet related , context that stems from two findings for agns with radio powers similar to j1502se / sw .    first , the radio source j1148 + 5924 has a spectral power of @xmath14 w hz@xmath1 , a factor of a few below that of j1502s @xcite .",
    "j1148 + 5924 is dominated by radio emission with an extent of less than 1 kpc , shows a slow apparent separation speed of 0.3c on parsec scales , and displays slow radio variability @xcite .",
    "such traits are shared by the powerful csos @xcite , suggesting that j1148 + 5924 is a low - power cso .",
    "moreover , j1502s shows evidence for an overall rotational symmetry on scales 0.1 - 10 kpc ( d14 ) .",
    "j1148 + 5924 also shows evidence for an overall rotational symmetry on similar scales , possibly caused by interactions between the low - power radio outflow and the circumnuclear gas and dust @xcite .",
    "redshifted hi is seen in absorption against the two - sided structures in j1148 + 5924 @xcite , and this infalling gas could fuel and/or distort the slow - moving radio outflow .",
    "second , the obscured agn j1502s was originally [ oiii]-selected @xcite and has a luminosity of @xmath15 } ) = 3.6 \\times 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath1 . in their analysis of the radio properties of obscured agn that have @xmath15",
    "} ) \\sim 10^{42}$ ] erg s@xmath1 , @xcite find a high incidence of spectra that are flat or rising between 1.4 and 8.4 ghz .",
    "those authors speculate that such radio spectra could be caused by free - free absorption in the ionized gas traced in [ oiii ] .",
    "j1502s has a similar [ oiii ] luminosity .",
    "this hints that free - free absorption could contribute to the flat spectra d14 measure for j1502se / sw , although achieving flatness between 1.7 - 15.7 ghz could be a challenge for such an absorption model .",
    "still , this suggestion is testable with vlba imaging spanning a wide frequency range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could also help reveal emission from a centrally located origin of activity .",
    "d14 cite a 10% uncertainty in the amplitude scale of the evn at 5 ghz .",
    "factoring this into their reported photometry leads to flux densities of 857@xmath499 @xmath16jy and 872@xmath4100 @xmath16jy for j1502se and j1502sw , respectively , in 2011 april 12 .",
    "comparison with the vlba photometry ( table 1 ) obtained more than two years later implies no time variability , another trait consistent with cso - like behavior . from the evn images , the apparent separation between j1502se and j1502sw increases by less than 5 pc yr@xmath1 .",
    "for comparson , for j1148 + 5924 the apparent separation increases by 0.1 pc yr@xmath1 .",
    "if j1502se / sw have a similarly - slow apparent separation , it would be advantageous to monitor that separation with the vlba s higher sensitivity and higher resolution .",
    "more broadly , establishing a double - hotspot scenario for the dust - obscured agn j1502s could have important implications for feedback in obscured agns , whether those agn are discovered in surveys for x - ray or infrared continuum or for narrow optical emission lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) or in increasingly deep vlba surveys ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "conversely , our study underscores the importance of culling double - hotspot sources from vlba surveys seeking candidate binary bhs on parsec scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or strong gravitational lenses on mas scales @xcite .      from table  1 the vlba detection of j1502p at @xmath5 = 5 ghz",
    "has a rest - frame brightness temperature of 4.8 million k , or more if truly unresolved .",
    "such levels are not achieved by even the most compact startbursts @xcite .",
    "also , the vlba image is too shallow to detect even the most luminous radio supernovae beyong @xmath17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus the vlba detection indicates that j1502p must be agn driven , confirming , independent of f11 , that j1502p hosts an agn . at @xmath5",
    "= 5 ghz , the vla photometry ( f11 ) localizes the emission to a diameter of 300 mas ( 1.6 kpc ) , whereas the evn photometry ( d14 ) , obtained only about two months earlier , recovers less than 20% of the vla signal .",
    "both this fact and the overall steep - spectrum nature of j1502p ( f11 ) suggest that source - resolution effects are at play , a motivation for deeper vlba imaging .",
    "we used the vlba at 5  ghz to image j1502 + 1115 , a merging system at @xmath18 containing a dust - obscured agn , j1502s , offset by 1.4 ( 7.4 kpc ) from an unobscured agn , j1502p ( f11 ) .",
    "regarding j1502s , d14 advocate it as hosting two agns and , thus , two supermassive bhs , based on evn images at 1.7 and 5  ghz showing two slightly - resolved , flat - spectrum radio sources , j1502se / sw , offset by 26 mas ( 140 pc ) .",
    "d14 reached their intriguing interpretation of a 140-pc binary bh after discounting a double - hotspot scenario , wherein both hotspots are energized by a single , central bh , a configuration occuring amongst radio - selected csos .",
    "when observed with sufficient sensitivity and resolution , an object with double hotspots should have an edge - brightened appearance .",
    "we find clear evidence for such edge - brightening in our vlba image of j1502s that has higher sensitivity and resolution than the evn images .",
    "we thus conclude that the double - hotspot scenario should be reconsidered as a viable interpretation for j1502se / sw . we also suggest that free - free absorption by j1502s s [ oiii ] emitting gas could help flatten the radio spectra of j1502se / sw . future vlba imaging can further test the double - hotspot scenario for j1502se / sw , as well as the potential role of free - free absorption .",
    "a double - hotspot scenario could have important consequences for feedback modes in obscured agns , a key population for understanding evolutionary linkages between galaxies and the bhs they host .",
    "future vlba imaging of samples of low - power csos is also needed to investigate trends between spectral indices and projected linear sizes , to help distinguish low - power csos from close binary bhs . and",
    "because the detection of polarized intensity is relatively rare among powerful csos @xcite , such vlba imaging should include polarimetry as a possible discriminant between low - power csos and close binary bhs .",
    "regarding j1502p , as it is detected in our vlba image , it must be agn driven .",
    "this confirms , independent of f11 , that j1502p hosts an agn .",
