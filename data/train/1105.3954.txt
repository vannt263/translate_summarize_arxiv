    "we caution , however , that while the light profile of the primary component of these galaxies is therefore `` disklike '' in the sense that the light profile falls off more slowly with radius than for bulge - like profiles ( @xmath90 ) , these are generally _ not _ classical disks in a morphological or kinematic ( e.g. , frster - schreiber et al .",

    "2005 , franx et al .",

    "( 2005 ) , who found little evidence for evolution of the stellar mass - radius relation from @xmath129 to the present day .",
    "we note that our results are robust to our choice to adopt @xmath7 of the brightest component as the effective radius for the galaxy while stellar masses are derived from the total integrated light from all clumps within a given galaxy .",
    "if we instead scale the stellar mass of the galaxy by the fraction of f160w flux contained within the primary component ( or indeed , if we ignore the comparable - magnitude multi - clump systems entirely ) our derived value of @xmath112 changes by less than 1% , and the index @xmath130 of the redshift evolution changes by @xmath131 .",
    "such a trend might , however , be telling us less about the growth of galaxies within their dark matter halos than about the evolution of the sites of star formation in the young universe .",
    "it is not necessarily surprising that @xmath80 star forming galaxies do not adhere precisely to the local mass - radius relation for late - type galaxies since ( despite a similar radial index of their rest - frame optical light distribution ) they represent drastically different physical systems . at fixed stellar mass ,",
