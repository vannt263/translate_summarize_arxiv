    "high energy transient events from compact sources are characterized by rapid increases in x - ray luminosity ( greater than @xmath1 orders of magnitude ) out of a normal or quiescent state .",
    "many studies in the particular topic of x - ray transients are related to accreting galactic black holes ( gbh ) and to the weakly magnetized neutron stars ( ns ) in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) . in these sources ,",
    "the x - ray outburst is originated by sudden increases of accretion rate probably triggered by a viscous - thermal instability in the accretion disk ( lasota , 2001 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the sources are often discovered in coincidence with the outbursts , as these are usually separated by very long quiescence periods ( @xmath2  months to decades ) .",
    "the asm on board rxte and the wfc on board bepposax have provided a wealth of new discoveries in less than a decade , resulting in a big increase in the number of known lmxb objects . for bepposax , the systematic monitoring of the galactic bulge region as part of the mission core programme ( see in  t zand et al .",
    "2004 for review ) was complemented by a target of opportunity ( too ) program aimed at the detailed spectral study on a wide spectral band ( 0.2 - 200 kev ) .",
    "this led to successful observations for a sample of x - ray bursters ( see table  1 ) .",
    "[ tab1 ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fig1 ]",
    "in transient bursters , outbursts have a typical duration of days to weeks and type - i x - ray bursts ( thermonuclear flashes on a ns surface , lasting @xmath2  seconds to minutes ) are often observed during source activity . as for gbh transients , bursters may behave as soft x - ray transients ( sxt ) with short rise , exponential decay light curves at high luminosities , or undergo weak outburst ( l@xmath3  erg / s ) . in fig.1",
    "the light curves of two transient bursters are shown . in the case of sax  j1747.0 - 2853 ( 1998 outburst )",
    "the flux is slowly rising and the luminosity of the source is a small fraction ( @xmath4% ) of the eddington luminosity .",
    "both curves have been obtained with the wfc instrument ( jager et al .",
    "1997 ) on board bepposax . for sax  j1750.8 - 2900",
    "the outburst is typical of sxt and the luminosity is @xmath5  erg / s or less . for this source , an upper limit to the distance of @xmath6",
    "kpc is available by the observation of the peak luminosity of x - ray bursts .",
    "references to these observations are given in table  i.    both sax  j1747.0 - 2853 and sax  j1750.8 - 2900 experienced further activity . in the spring of 2000 , saxj1747.8 - 2900 had a luminous outburst with sxt behaviour ( natalucci et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "a light curve with multiple peaks was measured by rxte / pca ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) indicating the presence of variations on the time scale of days .",
    "an important characteristic of this source is that after this long , exponential decay outburst , the source did not return to quiescence but entered a period of low luminosity activity ( wijnands et al 2002 ) for more than one year . very recently",
    "( march 2004 ) , the source brightened to an intensity greater than 200  mcrab ( markwardt & swank , 2004 ; deluit et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "sax j1750.8 - 2900 had also a second , luminous outburst in the spring of 2001 . during this outburst , ms oscillations in the rise of an x - ray burst and khz qpos",
    "were recently discovered with rxte ( kaaret et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this paper , we present detection of further x - ray bursts and the results of a preliminary study of the broadband spectrum obtained by the nfi ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) on board bepposax .",
    "spectra of transient bursters were obtained in both low / hard and high / soft states . due to the low energy extension ( down to @xmath7  kev ) of the nfi ,",
    "both the thermal emission from disk or ns and the low energy tail of the comptonized spectrum could be modelled . in the low / hard state",
    "the thermal component is generally weak , contributing a fraction of @xmath8% of the total flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "modelled by a pure blackbody , the thermal emission has a typical colour temperature below @xmath9  kev .",
    "the spectra of these bursters during a low / hard state outburst is very similar to the ones of low luminosity , persistent bursters ( see e.g. barret et al . , 2000 ) and their high energy spectrum is generally well described by thermal comptonization with a plasma temperature @xmath10  @xmath11  kev .",
    "a notable exception is the source sax  j1810.8 - 2900 , discovered by the wfc in march 1998 , with its very hard spectrum compatible with a pure power - law ( see fig.2 , compared to the low state spectrum of sax  j1747.0 - 2853 ) .",
    "sax j1747.0 - 2853 was also observed by the nfi in a high state .",
    "unfortunately , due to its vicinity to the galactic centre , the high energy instrument pds was affected by source confusion and could not be used effectively for this observation . in fig.3 the high state spectrum of the march 2000 outburst is shown . for this event ,",
    "the x - ray emission is characterized by a soft component with temperature @xmath12  kev and by a second component , which is most likely non - thermal ( see details in natalucci et al .",
    "2004 ) . since for this observation",
    "we could not obtain valid spectral measurements above 10.5  kev , in fig.3 two model spectra are shown corresponding to spectral fits with or without a hard comptonization tail .",
    "[ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]",
    "after the outburst of 1997 , sax  j1750.8 - 2900 had a second eruption in 2001 . on this occasion , the bepposax / nfi performed successfully two observations . during the 1st one on 23 - 24 march ,",
    "the source intensity was @xmath13  mcrab ( 2 - 10 kev ) and the source was in a rising phase ; on 9 - 10 april , the intensity was slowly decaying with an average value of 43 mcrab . the light curve of this observation in shown in fig.4 for the mecs instrument ( units 2 + 3 ) . in this dataset",
    "we detect the presence of three x - ray bursts , which are visible in the 100  s binned curve .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]    [ fig6 ]    in fig.5 the profile of the first x - ray burst is shown for two different energy bands . from the plot itself",
    "we see clear evidence of spectral softening with time ( as expected from a type - i x - ray burst ) .",
    "the intensity of this burst corresponds to a bolometric fluence of @xmath14  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath16 , similar to the other bursts observed from this source .",
    "no x - ray bursts were observed during the first observation , when the intensity was 10 times lower .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behaviour observed in 1997 , where most x - ray bursts occurred at an intermediate level of persistent flux ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .    in fig . 6 the count rate spectrum is shown for the two nfis , after subtraction of the data sections corresponding to the detected bursts .",
    "both observations were fitted with a model consisting of two components : a multicolor disk blackbody plus thermal comptonization .",
    "a standard systematic error of 1% was used to account for calibration related uncertainties .",
    "the above model is found to provide good fits : @xmath17=0.84 ( 61 dof ) and @xmath17=1.07 ( 144 dof ) for the 1st and 2nd observation , respectively .",
    "for the second observation , the model is in good agreement with the spectrum found by rxte / pca ( kaaret et al .",
    "2002 ) in a quasi - simultaneous observation , yielding a relatively low plasma temperature ( @xmath10  @xmath18  kev in our fit ) .",
    "however , the temperature is not well constrained .",
    "we attempted to add the pds data ( 15 - 200 kev ) but due to possible significant source contamination , this analysis is difficult and work is still in progress .",
    "a significant sample of the x - ray bursters detected by the bepposax wfc during the galactic centre monitoring program has been studied by dedicated follow - up observations with the nfi instruments .",
    "one of the sources ( sax  j1747.0 - 2853 ) had outbursts in both low / hard and high / soft state besides showing very long ( @xmath9  year or more ) , low luminosity activity .",
    "another recurrent transient , sax  j1750.8 - 2900 , showed two relatively luminous episodes with sxt behaviour , the latest occurring in march 2001 . in this paper we have presented the main spectral characteristics of these sources along with some preliminary results of the second outburst of sax  j1750.8 - 2900 . during this event , at least three x - ray bursts were present in the light curve , which were clearly spot by the sensitive nfis .",
