    "one of the most outstanding and clean predictions of inflationary paradigm is related to relic gravity waves @xcite which are generated quantum mechanically in the early universe .",

    "since the effect was not observed , the tensor to scalar ratio was supposed to be negligibly small . however , the recent observations on cmb polarization has demonstrated that the effect is sizeable , namely , the scalar to tensor ratio of perturbations , @xmath1 @xcite such that the scale of inflation is around the gut scale .",
    "quintessential inflation @xcite , a unified description of inflation and dark energy using a single scalar field , is necessarily followed by kinetic regime responsible for blue spectrum of relic gravity waves @xcite .",
    "these scenarios can be classified into type i and type ii . in first type",
    ", we consider models for which the scalar field potential is exponentially steep for most of the history of universe and only at late times the potential turns shallow . in type ii , we place models with potentials , shallow at early times followed by steep behavior thereafter .",
    "ideally , quintessential inflation requires a potential that could felicitate slow roll in the early phase followed by approximately steep exponential behavior such that the potential turns shallow only at late times .",
    "steep nature of potential is necessitated for the radiative regime to commence and peculiar steep behavior is needed to realize the scaling regime .",
    "however , the generic potentials do not change their character so frequently , they rather broadly come into two said categories : + type a : the inverse power law and @xmath2 hyperbolic potentials belong to this category . in this case one",
    "requires to assist slow roll by an extra damping at early times . in randall - sundrum scenario",
    "@xcite , the high energy corrections to einstein equations @xcite give rise to brane - damping which assists slow roll along a steep potential @xcite . as the field rolls down its potential , high energy corrections cease leading to graceful exit from inflation .",
    "unfortunately , the tensor to scalar ratio in this case is too large , @xmath3 to be consistent with observations and the steep brane - world inflation is therefore ruled out . + type b : in this case , the field potential stays steep after inflation . in this case",
    ", the late time behavior can be achieved by invoking an extra feature in the potential .",
    "for instance , massive neutrino matter with non - minimally coupled to scalar field can give rise to minimum of the potential at late times when neutrinos become non - relativistic @xcite .    in this paper , we shall describe a class of models of quintessential inflation of this category and look for parameter space which could comply with the recent measurement of b mode polarization spectrum@xcite .",
    "in case of small - field approximation , we have @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the potential becomes @xmath19 @xcite which can give rise to slow roll for small values of @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , for very large values of @xmath9 , we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the potential reads @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 is expressed in terms of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 .",

    "let us note that the conventional ( p)reheating mechanism does not work in quintessential inflation .",

    "it is required that the field potential is steep in the post inflationary era , allowing radiative regime to commence . in this case , during scaling regime , @xmath93 ; nucleysynthesis from _ planck _",

    "an important comment regarding the small and large field limit inflation is in order .",
    "as noticed before , the boundary of the two regions is given by @xmath99 .",
    "thus , in case inflation commences in the large field regime , @xmath20 needs to be small in order to collect the required number of e - foldings .",
    "however , if inflation begins around the boundary , the slow roll region is larger and we might improve upon the numerical values of @xmath20 for the given number of e - foldings , thereby giving rise to larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the large field approximation does not lead to the desired result in view of the recent observations .    at the commencement of inflation we have @xmath100 which gives us the value of the potential at the beginning of inflation @xmath101 now replacing @xmath26 from ( [ eq : al_bet_n ] ) we acquire @xmath102 @xmath103 gives the scale of inflation as in relation ( [ eq : inf_scale ] ) and for consistency check the value given by @xmath104",

    "finally , we also have @xmath108 which for large field limit reduces to @xmath109 @xcite . during the inflationary phase of the universe the first friedmann equation reduces to @xmath110 , and",
    "this provides the ratio @xmath111 .",

    "the scale factor goes as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 . in order to compute the spectral energy density of gravity waves , we need to compute the bogoliubov coefficients ( for detailed calculations",
    "one can see @xcite ) . in order to obtain the analytical expression one assumes inflation to be exponential . in that case , the spectral energy density @xmath130 , after the transition from de sitter to post inflationary phase , characterized by the equation - of - state parameter @xmath113 , is given by @xcite , @xmath131    in the model under consideration the post inflationary dynamics is described by the scalar field in the kinetic regime with @xmath132 , which implies that @xmath133 thereby a blue spectrum of gravity wave background .",
    "let us again note that in our case as usual , @xmath134 is small which we ignored when assumed inflation to be exactly exponential .",
    "the blue spectrum in our proposal is solely attributed to the kinetic regime that follows quintessential inflation irrespective of the underlying model .    as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the gravitational waves amplitude increases during the kinetic regime and this might come into conflict with nucleosynthesis at the commencement of radiative regime , in case the kinetic regime is long .",
    "since the standard mechanism does not work here , one assumes that radiation with energy density @xmath135 is produced via an alternative mechanism .",
    "the ratio of the field energy density to @xmath135 , can be compared with the ratio of the energy density in gravity waves @xmath136 to radiation energy density at the beginning of radiative era , namely , @xmath137 where , @xmath138 is the square of dimensionless gravity wave amplitude .",
    "nucleosynthesis imposes a stringent constraint on the ratio of energy densities at equality , that is @xmath139 , thereby giving rise to the lower bound of @xmath140 at the end of inflation which reads @xmath141 and it also gives @xmath142 .",
