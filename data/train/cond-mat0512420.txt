    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity by bednorz and mller @xcite , the unusual physical properties of the copper oxides have stimulated theorists and have led to the appearance of many new ideas @xcite .",
    "one of the especially appealing new pictures that has emerged is the instability towards a novel type of coexisting incommensurate ( ic ) charge and magnetic order , i.e. , stripe phase . as a rare event in the theory of high temperature superconductivity ,",
    "the theory preceeded here the experiment and the existence of stripe phases was predicted on the basis of hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations in the two - band model for cuo@xmath0 planes of layered la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) @xcite , before their experimental confirmation .",
    "this instability persists as well in the effective single - band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "all these calculations yielded solutions with a phase separation manifested in formation of nonmagnetic lines of holes , one - dimensional ( 1d ) domain walls or stripes , which separate antiferromagnetic ( af ) domains of opposite phases .",
    "such states result from the competition between the superexchange interaction , which stabilize the af long - range order in the parent mott insulator , and the kinetic energy of doped holes .",
    "indeed , the magnetic energy is gained when electrons occupy the neighboring sites and their spins order as in the nel state , whereas the kinetic energy is gained when the holes can move and the af order is locally suppressed along a domain wall ( dw ) .",
    "thus , a stripe phase provides the best compromise between the superexchange promoting the af order and the kinetic energy of doped holes .    however , the debate on the microscopic origin of the stripe instability is far from closed .",
    "two main scenarios , based on a ginzburg - landau free energy , for the driving mechanism of the stripe phase have been discussed @xcite . in the first one , stripes are charge - density waves with large periodicity arising from the fermi surface ( fs ) instability with the transition being spin driven @xcite .",
    "a general feature of such an instability is a gap / pseudogap which opens up precisely on the fs .",
    "hence , the spacing between dws is equal to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting doping level so as to maintain a gap / pseudogap on the fs . in this scenario",
    "spin and charge order occur at the same temperature or charge stripe order sets in only after spin order has developed .",
    "an alternative scenario comes from the coulomb - frustrated phase separation suggesting that stripe formation is charge driven . indeed , using the ising model",
    ", it has been shown that the competition between long range coulomb interactions and short range attraction between holes leads to formation of stripes @xcite . in this case",
    "ginzburg - landau considerations lead to an onset of charge order prior to spin order as the temperature is lowered .",
    "however , the above analysis does not take into account spin fluctuations which might be crucial for the nature of the phase transition by precluding the spins from ordering at the charge - order temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , the conjecture that long range coulomb forces are required to stabilize stripe phases has been challenged by the studies of the @xmath6-@xmath7 model , in which the dw structures were obtained without such interactions @xcite .    in order to investigate the influence of strong electron correlations due to large on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 at cu ions , several methods have been employed to study the stripe phases which go beyond the hf approximation , such as : density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , slave - boson approximation ( sba ) @xcite , variational local ansatz approximation @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed ) of finite clusters @xcite , analytical approach based on variational trial wave function within the string picture @xcite , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite . in spite of this huge effort",
    ", it remains unclear whether dws are centered on rows of metal atoms , hereafter named site - centered ( sc ) stripes , or if they are centered on rows of oxygen atoms bridging the two neighboring metal sites , the so - called bond - centered ( bc ) stripes , and even calculations performed on larger clusters did not yield a definite answer @xcite .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to study the stability of both structures based on the mean - field method applied either to the extended single - band hubbard model or the single - band peierls - hubbard hamiltonian which includes the so - called static phonons @xcite . for stable phases we determine charge and magnetization densities , double occupancy , kinetic and magnetic energies , and",
    "investigate the role of a finite electron - lattice coupling .",
    "experimentally , stripe phases are most clearly detected in insulating compounds with a static stripe order , but there is growing evidence of fluctuating stripe correlations in metallic and superconducting materials . the most direct evidence for stripe phases in doped antiferromagnets has come from neutron scattering studies in which charge and spin modulations are identified by the appearance of some ic bragg peaks , in addition to those which correspond to the crystal structure .",
    "however , sometimes sufficiently large crystals are not available for such experiments , and one has to resort to other methods capable of probing local order .",
    "these methods include nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , nuclear quadruple resonance ( nqr ) , muon spin rotation ( @xmath9sr ) , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .",
    "furthermore , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , angle - integrated photoemission spectroscopy ( aipes ) , as well as x - ray photoemission ( xps ) and ultraviolet photoemission ( ups ) spectroscopies all provide essential information about conspicuous changes in the electronic structure when stripe structure sets in .",
    "finally , a distinct imprint of the 1d spin - charge modulation on transport properties should be detectable as the in - plane anisotropy of the resistivity and the hall coefficient @xmath10 .    the abundance of the current evidence on various types of stripe order as well as the recent arpes results on the spectral weight of the cuprate superconductors is contained in the review articles by kivelson _",
    "@xcite , and by damascelli _",
    "historically , the first compelling evidence for both magnetic and charge order in the cuprates was accomplished in a neodymium codoped compound la@xmath11nd@xmath12sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( nd - lsco ) . for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "_ @xcite found that the magnetic scattering is not characterized by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) af wave vector ( @xmath15 ) , but by ic peaks at the wave vectors @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , inspired by the pioneering works demonstrating that the staggered magnetization undergoes a phase shift of @xmath18 at the charge dws @xcite , the authors found additional charge order peaks @xmath19 , precisely at the expected position @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , this doping corresponds to a local minimum in the doping dependence of the superconducting temperature @xmath21 in nd - lsco @xcite , suggesting that the static stripes are responsible for this anomalous depression of superconductivity . however , it may well be that the apparent correlation is entirely accidental and therefore the role of stripes in superconductivity remains an open question @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in early studies tranquada _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite detected only magnetic ic peaks at higher doping levels @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , systematic nqr studies of nd - lsco revealed the presence of robust charge stripe order throughout the entire superconducting regime of doping @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "also in a more recent study , both charge and spin superlattice peaks at @xmath22 were found recently in the neutron diffraction experiments by wakimoto _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "in fact , the reason why static stripes could be detected in this compound is a structural transition from the low temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) to the low temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase , induced by the substitution for la ions by isovalent nd ions .",
    "this , in turn , provides a pinning potential for dynamic stripes and stabilizes the charge order .",
    "evidence of a similar pinning potential has also been found both in the @xmath9sr and nqr studies of la@xmath11eu@xmath12sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( eu - lsco ) with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the connection between the ltt phase and the appearance of charge and spin stripe order has been clearly demonstrated both in the neutron scattering and @xmath5-ray diffraction studies on la@xmath11ba@xmath12sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( ba - lsco ) with @xmath26 @xcite . finally , static ic charge @xmath27 and magnetic @xmath16 peaks have been detected within the ltt phase of la@xmath1ba@xmath28cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the position of the peaks and the established incommensurability @xmath17 are exactly the same as those obtained by tranquada _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite for nd - lsco .",
    "notably , the peaks that correspond to charge order appear always at somewhat higher temperature than the magnetic ones , indicating that the stripe order is driven by the charge instability .",
    "let us now discuss the experimental evidence of slowly fluctuating stripes in la@xmath1sr@xmath28cuo@xmath3 .",
    "the main difference between the ba and sr codoped system is the fact that the latter undergoes a structural phase transition from the high - temperature tetragonal ( htt ) phase to the lto phase . as a consequence , in the superconducting regime @xmath30 , the lsco system exhibits purely _ dynamic _ magnetic correlations which give rise to ic peaks at the wave vector @xmath16 specified in tetragonal lattice units @xmath31 . in their seminal inelastic neutron scattering studies ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite established a remarkably simple relation @xmath32 for @xmath33 , followed by a lock - in effect at @xmath34 for larger @xmath5 .     in the cuprates .",
    "results have been obtained by different groups : nd - lsco ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; lsco ( refs .",

    "@xcite ) ; zn - lsco ( refs .",

    ", @xmath35 has been defined as a distance from the ic peak position to the af wave vector ( @xmath15 ) either in the orthorhombic ( @xmath36 ) or tetragonal ( @xmath37 ) notation ( see insets ) , whereas at @xmath38 , both definitions are used due to the coexistence of diagonal and parallel to the cu - o bonds spin modulations . ,",
    "scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in contrast , in the insulating spin - glass regime of lsco @xmath39 , quasielastic neutron scattering experiments with the main weight at zero frequency demonstrate that ic magnetic peaks are located at the wave vectors @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has often been interpreted as the existence of static diagonal stripes , even though no signatures of a charge modulation were observed .",
    "another possible explanation is the formation of a short ranged spiral order as its chirality also breaks the translational symmetry of the square lattice by a clockwise or anticlockwise twist @xcite .",
    "remarkably , even though the spin modulation changes from a diagonal to vertical / horizontal one , i.e. , along cu - o bonds , at @xmath5 around 0.06 , @xmath35 follows the doping @xmath5 reasonably well over the entire range @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] .",
    "in fact , just for @xmath38 , both diagonal ( @xmath42 ) and vertical / horizontal ( @xmath43 ) ic spin modulations have been found to coexist @xcite . in a stripe model",
    "this corresponds to a constant density of 0.5 ( 0.7 ) holes per cu atom in the dws in the vertical / horizontal ( diagonal ) stripe phases , respectively , because of the difference in cu spacings in the two geometries , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , in the narrow region @xmath45 , ic magnetic peaks are located at the wave vector @xmath46 with @xmath32 corresponding to a constant charge of one hole / cu ion along a diagonal dw @xcite . however , below @xmath47",
    ", this does not hold anymore and the incommensurability gets locked with the value @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , any concomitant charge ordering has not yet been detected in lsco .",
    "nevertheless , by comparing the data based on the wipeout effect of @xmath49cu nqr charge order parameter in lsco with the ones obtained from charge stripe compounds as ( nd , eu , ba)-lsco , hunt _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite concluded that a similar stripe instability exists in lsco over the whole underdoped superconducting region @xmath50 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that a very compiling evidence for its existence has been established in the measurements of the in - plane resistivity and the dynamical infrared conductivity anisotropy @xcite .",
    "experimental detection of ic magnetic peaks in the lto phase of lsco suggests that the ltt structure is not essential for the appearance of stripes .",
    "this conjecture has been confirmed in experiments on the oxygen doped la@xmath51cuo@xmath52 ( lco ) with the orthorhombic crystal structure @xcite .",
    "it is also supported by the evidence for _ static _ ic magnetic peaks in another orthorhombic compound la@xmath1sr@xmath28cu@xmath53zn@xmath54o@xmath3 ( zn - lsco ) with @xmath55 up to @xmath56 , even though attempts to observe the charge order peaks were unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "in fact , zn substitution pins the stripe fluctuations similarly to the rare - earth elements .",
    "however , in contrast to the latter , it does not induce a structural transition to the ltt phase , but provides randomly distributed pinning centers that promote meandering of stripes and correspondingly broadens ic peaks .",
    "an important question is whether charge stripes appear solely in monolayered lanthanum compounds or if they are a generic feature of all the cuprates .",
    "the latter conjecture seems to be supported by inelastic neutron scattering experiments on bilayered yba@xmath51cu@xmath57o@xmath58 ( ybco ) compounds that have identified the presence of ic spin fluctuations throughout its entire superconducting regime @xcite .",
    "in fact , as the doped charge is nontrivially distributed between the cuo@xmath0 planes and cuo chains , it is very difficult to determine the precise doping level @xmath5 in the cuo@xmath0 sheet of ybco .",
    "nevertheless , systematic studies by dai _",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the incommensurability in ybco increases initially with doping but it saturates faster than in lsco , i.e. , already at @xmath59 with the value @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no any compelling explanation that would account for such a different behavior of @xmath35 in both systems .",
    "eventually , charge order peaks have been observed in ybco@xmath61 but in spite of several attempts , no static charge order could be detected in ybco@xmath62 and ybco@xmath63 so far @xcite .",
    "furthermore , although some neutron scattering experiments have been performed on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath64 ( bscco ) sample , the sample has only produced weak evidence of the ic structure @xcite .",
    "in contrast , fourier transform of the recent stm data has revealed some ic peaks corresponding to a four - period modulation of the local density of states along the cu - o bond direction , which may imply the existence of stripes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , definite answer pertinent to the appearance of stripes in all the cuprates remains still unsettled and further experiments are required to reach an unambiguous conclusion , even though the summary of the experimental data illustrating the doping dependence of the incommensurability @xmath35 in cuprates , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon ] , includes an array of compounds .",
    "tendency towards phase separation is also a starting point to understand the doping evolution of the electronic structure in lsco and nd - lsco .",
    "for example , arpes spectra measured at the @xmath65 point in lsco show that even though the data are solely characterized by a single high binding energy feature in the insulating regime , upon increasing doping one observes a systematic transfer of spectral weight from the high- to the low binding energy part @xcite .",
    "consequently , a well - defined quasiparticle ( qp ) peak develops near the optimal doping .",
    "in contrast , the intensity near the @xmath66 point remains suppressed for the entire underdoped regime so that a qp peak is observed only for @xmath67 .",
    "another peculiar feature of the arpes band dispersion is extensively discussed in the literature saddle point at the @xmath68 point , the so - called flat band @xcite .",
    "as hole doping increases , the flat band moves monotonically upwards and crosses the fermi level @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "this is reflected in the enhancement of the dos at the chemical potential @xmath71 observed by aipes @xcite .",
    "the experimental distribution of the photoemission spectral weight near the @xmath68 and @xmath72 points in doped lsco has been nicely reproduced using the dmft approach for vertical sc stripes obtained within the hubbard model @xcite . as a consequence of the stripe order ,",
    "the obtained spectra along the @xmath73 path were not equivalent to those along the @xmath74 one , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 . moreover , as in the experiment , the spectral weight along the @xmath77 direction was suppressed close to the @xmath78 point and simultaneously enhanced at the @xmath68 point .",
    "furthermore , in the framework of stripes , the flat qp band near the @xmath68 point with a large intensity at the maximum below the chemical potential @xmath9 follows from a superposition of the dispersionless 1d metallic band along the @xmath5 direction , formed by holes propagating along the vertical domain walls , and an insulating band that stems from the af domains . in contrast , an af band at the @xmath79 point is characterized by a high binding energy well below @xmath9 and consequently the spectral weight at @xmath80 almost vanishes . finally , a distinct gap for charge excitations should open at @xmath9 near the @xmath72 point .",
    "this gap follows indeed from the stripe structure  while the system may be metallic along the stripes , i.e. , in the antinodal directions @xmath77 or @xmath81 , the low - energy excitations should be noticeably suppressed along the nodal direction @xmath82 crossing all the stripes .",
    "this conjecture is also supported either by the ed studies @xcite or by the analytical approach based on variational trial wave function within the string picture @xcite , both applied to the @xmath6-@xmath83-@xmath84-@xmath7 model , or by the cpt for the @xmath6-@xmath7 model @xcite .",
    "in fact , the low - energy spectral weight of nd - lsco at @xmath14 , a model compound for which the evidence of spin and charge stripe order is the strongest , is also mostly concentrated in flat regions along the @xmath77 and @xmath81 directions , while there is only little spectral weight along the @xmath82 direction @xcite . on the other hand , arpes spectra of both lsco and nd - lsco at @xmath22",
    "have revealed not only the presence of flat bands around the @xmath68 and @xmath79 points , but also the existence of appreciable spectral weight at @xmath69 in the nodal region @xcite . while the observation of flat segments might be directly ascribed to 1d domain walls @xcite , detection of nodal spectral weight poses a formidable task to develop a theory that would describe the electronic structure resembling the fs of a fully 2d system because , as it was already stressed out , the nodal spectral weight is expected to be suppressed in a static sc stripe picture @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the experimentally established fs looks rather like the one arising from disorder or from dynamically fluctuating stripes @xcite .    alternatively , guided by the cpt results showing that",
    "while the sc stripes yield little spectral weight near the nodal region , the bc ones reproduce quite well the nodal segments @xcite , zhou _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite have conjectured that the experimental fs may result from the coexistence of the sc and bc stripes . within this framework , upon increasing doping the bc stripes",
    "are formed at the expense of the sc ones .",
    "this scenario is particularly interesting because it has been shown that the bc stripe , in contrast to its sc counterpart , enhances superconducting pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "the relevance of a bond order at the doping level @xmath22 is supported by recent studies of the arpes spectra in a system with the bc stripes @xcite .",
    "these studies have yielded pronounced spectral weight both in the nodal and antinodal directions , reproducing quite well the experimental results in nd - lsco and lsco @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the stripe scenario would also explain the origin of the already discussed two components seen in the arpes spectra at the @xmath68 point near @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the response from the af insulating regions would be pushed to the high binding energies due to the mott gap , whereas the charge stripes would be responsible for the other component near @xmath69 .",
    "existence of dws should also give rise to the appearance of new states inside the charge - transfer gap that would suppress the shift of the chemical potential @xmath9 in the underdoped regime @xmath86 where @xmath35 increases linearly .",
    "such pinning of @xmath9 in lsco was indeed deduced from xps experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the overdoped region with a lock - in effect of @xmath35 , the number of stripes per unit cell saturates , doped holes penetrate into the af domains , and consequently @xmath9 would move fast with doping in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the picture of broadened stripes and holes spreading out all over the af domains above @xmath29 is also indicated by the doping dependence of the resistivity and the hall coefficient @xmath10 in nd - lsco .",
    "namely , a rapid decrease in the magnitude of @xmath10 for doping level @xmath87 at low temperature provides evidence for the 1d charge transport , whereas for @xmath88 , relatively large @xmath10 suggests a crossover from the 1d to 2d charge transport @xcite .",
    "altogether , it appears that the metallic stripe picture does capture the essence of the low - lying physics for nd - lsco and lsco systems .",
    "conversely , it is important to note that so far no evidence of ic peaks has been detected in any electron - doped cuprates superconductors . instead",
    ", the neutron scattering experiments have established only _ commensurate _ spin fluctuations as in nd@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath89 ( ncco ) , both in the superconducting and in normal state @xcite .",
    "moreover , observation of such peaks is consistent with the xps measurements in ncco showing that the chemical potential increases monotonously with electron doping @xcite .",
    "in this section we attempt a systematic investigation of the properties and relative stability of filled vertical and diagonal stripes .",
    "we shall see that in spite of the difficulty to stabilize the ground state with half - filled stripes ( one hole per every two atoms in a dw ) , the mean - field framework is useful as providing a generic microscopic description of filled inhomogeneous reference structures with the filling of one doped hole per stripe unit cell .",
    "their special stability rests on a gap that opens in the symmetry broken state between the highest occupied state of the lower hubbard band and the bottom of the so - called mid - gap bands , i.e. , some additional unoccupied bands lying within the mott - hubbard gap that are formed due to holes propagating along dws @xcite .    here , we extend early hf studies of the filled dws @xcite and determine a phase diagram of the hubbard model with an anisotropic nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath6 by varying the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 and investigating locally stable structures for representative hole doping levels @xmath29 and @xmath90 .",
    "we also report the changes in stability of the stripe structures in the extended hubbard model due to the next - neighbor hopping @xmath83 and to the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath91 . finally , in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the competition between different types of stripes in a realistic model , we include lattice degrees of freedom induced by a static peierls electron - lattice coupling .      the starting point for the analysis of stripe structures",
    "is the extended single - band hubbard model , which is widely accepted as the generic model for a microscopic description of the cuprate superconductors @xcite , @xmath92 where the operator @xmath93 @xmath94 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath95 on lattice site @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , and @xmath98 gives the electron density .",
    "the hopping @xmath99 is @xmath6 on the bonds connecting nearest neighbors sites @xmath100 and @xmath83 for second - neighbor sites , while the on - site and nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions are , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath91 .",
    "the model can be solved self - consistently in real space within the hf , where the interactions are decoupled into products of one - particle terms becoming effective mean fields that act on each electron with the same strength .",
    "this approximation basically involves solving an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the obtained wavefunctions form a new potential and hence the hamiltonian for a new eigenvalue problem .",
    "typically , the new potential is chosen as some linear combination of the current and preceding potential .",
    "the iterations are continued until the input and output charge density and energy do not change within some prescribed accuracy .",
    "the most significant drawback of this method is that it neglects correlations .",
    "electron correlation changes the system properties and manifests itself in the decrease of the ground state energy .",
    "the difference between the energy of the exact ground state and the energy obtained within the hf is thus called the correlation energy .",
    "it arises from the fact that an electron s movement is correlated with the electrons around it , and accounting for this effect lowers further the energy , beyond the independent electron approximation .",
    "we do not consider noncollinear spin configurations , and use the most straightforward version of the hf with a product of two separate slater determinants for up and down spins , whence , @xmath101 a similar decoupling is performed for the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction .",

    "we compare the stability of such nonmagnetic sc domain walls with the bc stripe phases in which dws are formed by pairs of magnetic atoms , as obtained by white and scalapino @xcite ( _ cf_. fig .  [ fig:16bc ] ) . in the three - band model ,",
    "sc ( bc ) stripes correspond to dws centered at metal ( oxygen ) sites , respectively @xcite .",
    "we begin by setting @xmath128 and @xmath129 with the goal of elucidating the effects of hopping anisotropy on the stripes .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the first detection of static stripes in both charge and spin sectors was accomplished in nd - lsco @xcite indicating that rare - earth elements doping is in some way helpful for pinning the stripe structure .",
    "indeed , it produces a structural transition in the system from the lto to ltt phase @xcite .",
    "both phases involve a distortion of the cuo@xmath0 plane by rotation of the cuo@xmath130 octahedra . in the lto phase the tilt axis runs diagonally within the copper plane , such that all the oxygen atoms are displaced out of the plane .",
    "conversely , in the ltt phase this rotation takes place around an axis oriented along the planar cu@xmath131o bonds .",
    "therefore , oxygen atoms on the tilt axis remain in the plane , while the ones in the perpendicular direction are displaced out of the plane .",
    "this provides a microscopic origin for in - plane anisotropies  the cu@xmath131cu hopping amplitude @xmath6 depends on the cu@xmath131o bond and it is isotropic in the lto phase and anisotropic in the ltt one . for a physical tilt angle of order 5@xmath132 , the relative anisotropy taking @xmath133 , @xmath134 is weak and amounts to @xmath135 @xcite .",

    "the in - plane anisotropies might also be represented theoretically by on - site potentials as in the qmc study by riera @xcite .",
    "all these studies have shown a pronounced tendency to forming stripe phases , which manifests itself by the reduction of their energy @xcite , accompanied by the appearance of ic peaks in the spin and charge structure factor @xcite .",
    "it appears that a finite anisotropy of the next - nearest hopping term @xmath83 might play a role in stabilizing diagonal incommensurate peaks observed in the spinglass phase of lsco ( @xmath142 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , although the lto phase is usually considered as isotropic , which is the case for nearest - neighbor hopping and interaction , a different length of the orthorhombic axes implies the need for an anisotropic @xmath83 parameter .",
    "exact diagonalization studies incorporating such anisotropy have shown that it strongly strengthens hole correlations along one direction and suppresses them along the other , resulting in a 1d pattern of holes @xcite .",
    "but for the bc stripe phases .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it turns out , however , that the variation of the hopping anisotropy @xmath143 ( [ eq : et ] ) has only a little visible effect on the local hole density , @xmath144 shown in fig .",

    "similarly , the anisotropy does not modify the modulated magnetization density , @xmath149 with a site dependent factor @xmath150 compensating modulation of the staggered magnetization density within a single af domain .    in contrast , the strong effect of finite anisotropy @xmath143 ( [ eq : et ] ) is clearly demonstrated by variation of the expectation values of the bond hopping terms along the @xmath5- and @xmath55-directions , @xmath151 these features are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc16 ] . for the vsc stripes",
    "one finds a large anisotropy in the values of the kinetic energies ( [ eq : etx ] ) and ( [ eq : ety ] ) , which becomes especially pronounced beside the stripes , and is strongly reinforced by the hopping anisotropy .",
    "therefore , taking into account that the hopping between two different charge densities is favored over motion between equal densities , one should expect that transverse charge fluctuations will always tune the direction of dws along the weaker hopping direction in the anisotropic model .",
    "analogous conclusion based on fig .",
    "[ fig : bc16 ] might be drawn concerning the orientation of the vbc stripes .",
    "regarding diagonal stripes , although a finite anisotropy in hopping is also reflected in the kinetic energy anisotropy , a system with either the dsc or dbc stripe pattern becomes topologically frustrated and consequently may gain less kinetic energy compared to a system with vertical stripes , taking a full advantage of the hopping anisotropy ( _ cf_. tables  [ tab:16e ] and [ tab:16ean ] ) .",

    "let us consider a site in the af domain with larger density of @xmath113-spin electrons ( at @xmath156 sublattice ) .",
    "once the magnetization is reduced , the corresponding @xmath113-spin energy level which belongs to the lower hubbard band is pushed upwards , and the @xmath112-spin of the upper hubbard band goes down . as a result , the locally raised @xmath113-spin state becomes stronger mixed with @xmath112-spin states at the surrounding sites of @xmath157 sublattice , and simultaneously bond - charge density increases . at the same time , electrons , jumping forth and back between the central site with the @xmath113-spin polarization and its nearest neighbors with the @xmath112-spin one , enhance considerably double occupancy @xmath158 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sc16pho ] and [ fig : bc16pho ] .",
    "this weakens the stripe order and results in a more uniform distribution of @xmath158 .",
    "of course , the increase of the elastic energy and concomitant enhancement of the on - site energy , both owing to finite bond contractions ( [ eq : ph ] ) , is compensated by the kinetic energy gain and the total energy is lowered ( _ cf_. tables [ tab:16e ] and [ tab:16eal ] ) .",

    "they were obtained by varying @xmath8 and the coefficient @xmath159 , while maintaining constant @xmath160@xmath161 .",
    "the increased stability of vertical stripes follows from the relative stronger enhancement of the local hopping elements ( [ eq : tuij ] ) ( and consequently larger gain of the kinetic energy ) , especially on the bonds in the direction perpendicular to the dws itself .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a competition between magnetic energy of interacting almost localized electrons and the kinetic energy of holes created by doping leads to the formation of new type of coexisting charge and spin order  the stripe phases .",
    "we have shown that vertical ( horizontal ) and diagonal stripes dominate the behavior of the charge structures formed by doping the antiferromagnet away from half filling , using the solutions obtained for the hubbard model within the hf approximation in the physically interesting regime of the coulomb interaction . the detailed charge distribution and the type of stripe order depend on the ratio @xmath162 , on the value of the next - neighbor hopping @xmath83 , and on the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath91 .",
    "we have also shown that a strong electron - lattice coupling might be responsible for the appearance of the vertical stripes observed in the superconducting cuprates at @xmath29 .    altogether , although some experimentally observed trends could be reproduced already in the hf approach , the presented results indicate that strong electron correlations play a crucial role in the stripe phases and have to be included for a more quantitative analysis .",
