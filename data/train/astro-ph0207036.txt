    "a supernova explosion is a dramatic event which includes such a rich diversity of physics @xcite that self - consistent numerical simulations on current computer hardware do not allow to include all relevant pieces at once .",
    "after stellar core collapse , a nascent neutron star is formed at the center of the event , requiring a description in general relativity .",
    "neutrinos generated in the compactifying region are tightly coupled to the matter at high densities , while they leak or stream out at lower densities .",
    "the collapsing stellar core bounces as the equation of state stiffens when nuclear densities are exceeded , and a shock wave is formed that ploughs outwards through the still infalling outer layers .",
    "multi - frequency radiation hydrodynamics must be used to quantify the energy that the neutrinos deposit in the material behind the shock .",
    "this energy deposition has been considered to be essential for the success or failure of the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "observational and theoretical evidence suggests that this neutrino heating drives convection behind the shock .",
    "instabilities in the protoneutron star , significant rotation , and strong magnetic fields further complicate the picture .",
    "observations of neutron star kicks , mixing of nuclear species , inhomogeneous ejecta , and polarization of spectra support the presence of asymmetries in supernova explosions @xcite . motivated by such observations , the neutrino driven explosion mechanism has been explored in multidimensions @xcite , and alternative jet - based explosion scenarios have received new momentum @xcite .",
    "because of their excessive computational demand , multi - dimensional simulations have had to rely on physically significant approximations .",
    "simulations are performed that impose the neutrino radiation field externally or uniformly , that prescribe the neutrino spectrum ab initio , that artificially seed instabilities , or that insert jets in order to explore important phenomena of supernova explosions in observational data .",
    "a complementary approach is to model supernovae in spherical symmetry .",
    "spherically symmetric simulations of stellar core collapse reach back to the late sixties @xcite when computers first became available . although the assumption of pure spherical symmetry is also a physically significant simplification , it can provide an essential contribution to the quality of numerical supernova models and their interpretation .",
    "a spherically symmetric model can implement full general relativity .",
    "additionally , the reduced number of computational zones allows an accurate treatment of neutrino radiation transport and the inclusion of sophisticated microscopic input physics . during the search for a robust supernova mechanism , standards in the nuclear input physics @xcite and weak interaction physics",
    "@xcite have been established . in recognition of the importance of neutrino transport in the supernova ,",
    "its numerical treatment has been improved from simple leakage schemes @xcite to multi - group flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) approximations @xcite to investigations of the full boltzmann transport equation @xcite .",
    "only recently have self - contained simulations of stellar core collapse and postbounce evolution with boltzmann neutrino transport been performed , in newtonian gravity and the o@xmath2 limit @xcite and in general relativistic space - time @xcite .",
    "they allow , on the one hand , the exploration of nuclear physics under extreme conditions , and , on the other hand , provide a solid point of reference for the construction of accurate multidimensional simulations @xcite .",
    "basic numerical techniques for radiative transfer have been designed and continuously improved over the last three decades ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for a review ) . in most applications , photons or neutrons",
    "are the transported particles . in our application",
    "to supernova dynamics , the transport of neutrinos requires a new combination of capabilities derived from both fields , photon and neutron transport .    as in _ neutron transport",
    "_ the radiation particles are fermions .",
    "in contrast to photons , the neutrinos assume a fermi - dirac distribution in thermal equilibrium .",
    "weak interactions with nuclear matter can be suppressed due to pauli blocking of final states .",
    "this makes the dependence of the collision integral on the distribution function nonlinear .",
    "several quantities have to be evolved with special care : an important constraint for the evolution of neutrino and electron abundances is lepton number conservation .",
    "while applications to photon transport do not require an exact count of photons as particles , the outcome of a supernova simulation sensitively depends on the deleptonization .",
    "the transfer of lepton number occurs via the reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the protons , @xmath5 , and neutrons , @xmath6 , are free or bound in nuclei .",
    "the electron neutrino , @xmath7 , and antineutrino , @xmath8 , may escape to infinity or be absorbed at distant locations .",
    "these reactions determine the electron fraction , and hence , the partial pressure of the electron gas in the fluid .",
    "this pressure contributes importantly to the dynamics if the electron gas is degenerate and the density lower than nuclear density . beside of the transport of lepton number ,",
    "the transport of energy is a crucial phenomenon in supernova dynamics .",
    "neutrinos escaping from the accreting material and the protoneutron star may be absorbed behind the stalled shock .",
    "this energy transfer is believed to add to the thermal pressure behind the shock such that ultimately a supernova explosion is launched with the ejection of the outer layers @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , the evolution of the global energy should be monitored . just before collapse , the progenitor star is marginally bound . during collapse ,",
    "the binding energy of the nascent protoneutron star increases dramatically .",
    "it is balanced by the internal energy of the compressed matter and the trapped neutrinos . only on a longer time scale",
    "is the energy of the radiation field transported away from the star while the emptied states in the neutrino phase space are immediately replenished by neutrino emission in the cooling protoneutron star . since the gravitational energy , the internal energy , and the energy in the radiation field rise to the order of @xmath9 erg , a detailed analysis of global energy conservation",
    "is advised in order to make the comparatively small explosion energy of @xmath10erg predictable . whether we choose a kinetic equation for the propagation of particle number or an equation prescribing the evolution of radiation intensity , it is a numerical challenge to conserve both lepton number and energy with the same finite difference representation of the transport equation .",
    "the following transport requirements more closely resemble the astrophysical applications of _ photon transport _ than neutron transport .",
    "owing to the protoneutron star or black hole formed at the center of the event , space - time is curved .",
    "the particles follow geodesics in general relativistic space - time , i.e. their angular distribution is affected by gravitational bending . additionally , the particle energies are subject to a gravitational frequency shift . in contrast to many neutron transport applications ,",
    "the fluid is highly dynamic during collapse and even more so after shock formation .",
    "thus , observer corrections for doppler shift and angular aberration have to be implemented as in photon transport applications .",
    "however , there is some freedom in the choice of where to apply these corrections . in an inertial frame",
    "they complicate the description of interactions in the collision integral . in a comoving frame",
    "they enter the transport terms in the boltzmann equation .",
    "we proceed with the latter choice in an @xmath11-method .",
    "our code , agile - boltztran , emerged from the following components : the neutrino transport part , boltztran , has been developed for the simulation of stellar core collapse in an implicitly finite differenced o@xmath2 approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been compared to mgfld in selected stationary state phases , and standard test problems for radiative transfer in supernovae have been performed @xcite .",
    "agile is an implicit general relativistic hydrodynamics code that evolves the einstein equations based on conservative finite differencing on an adaptive grid @xcite . in this paper , we describe how these codes are merged and extended to enable accurate simulations of the very dynamic postbounce phase . in particular , we detail the finite differencing of the observer corrections for the dynamic conservation of particle number and total energy in the transport scheme , and describe the extension of boltztran to general relativistic flows @xcite . in section [ section_physical_model ] ,",
    "we start with the characterization of the equation of state and a list of the included neutrino - matter interactions , followed by a collection of the basic equations of general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics in spherical symmetry .",
    "two exemplary runs from collapse through bounce and postbounce evolution are also described in this section . in order to test our code in a broad range of conditions , we launched simulations from a small @xmath12 m@xmath13 progenitor star @xcite and a very massive @xmath14 m@xmath13 progenitor star @xcite .",
    "we investigate the different regions of neutrino emission in the star .",
    "section [ section_computer_model ] is entirely devoted to the documentation of the finite differencing in our computer model . in section [ section_code_verification ] ,",
    "we analyze and verify the performance of our code in various example situations encountered in the evolution of the two simulation runs .",
    "we close the section with the comparison of our results with bruenn s multi - group flux - limited diffusion code which implements a recently developed new flux limiter @xcite .",
    "the physical model can be divided into two parts . on the one hand",
    ", there is the microscopic physics input  the specification of particle abundances and reaction cross sections .",
    "the microphysics in supernova models is continuously improving and many uncertainties remain to be resolved .",
    "however , in this methodological paper , we will only shortly summarize the ingredients that were standard at the time the code was written and hope that our code agile - boltztran will continue to be useful in future discussions and evaluations of input physics improvements .",
    "on the other hand , there are the radiation hydrodynamics equations we are solving on the computer .",
    "they are the foundation of our implementation of neutrino transport and receive a detailed discussion later in this section .",
    "the equation of state describes the thermodynamical state of a fluid element based on density , @xmath15 , temperature , @xmath16 , and the composition .",
    "we use the equation of state of @xcite .",
    "it assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium and we apply it wherever the density is larger than @xmath17 g/@xmath18 and the temperature larger than @xmath19k .",
    "this region is described by a liquid drop model for a representative nucleus with atomic number @xmath20 and charge @xmath21 , surrounded by free alpha particles , protons , and neutrons .",
    "the baryons are immersed in an electron and positron gas in equilibrium with a photon gas . beyond nuclear density , where no isolated nuclei are present , the complicated population of hadrons @xcite is approximated by bulk nuclear matter comprised of protons , neutrons , and electrons .",
    "however , the central density of the protoneutron star at bounce reaches only about twice nuclear density and the hadron population may only develop later , after the very dynamical postbounce phases . at the low temperature border of nuclear statistical equilibrium ,",
    "the equation of state is connected to a boltzmann gas of silicon atoms . in any of these cases , once the density and temperature are given , the composition is fully determined by the specification of the electron fraction @xmath22 .",
    "matter is connected to the neutrino radiation field by weak interactions .",
    "we consider neutrinos of all three flavors and assume that they are massless .",
    "the weak interactions enter the collision term in the boltzmann equation as energy- and angle - dependent emissivities , opacities , and scattering kernels .",
    "we include the set specified by @xcite : ( i ) electron - type neutrino absorption on neutrons , ( ii ) electron antineutrino absorption on protons , ( iii ) electron - type neutrino absorption on nuclei , ( iv ) neutrino - nucleon scattering , ( v ) coherent scattering of neutrinos on nuclei , ( vi ) neutrino - electron scattering , and ( vii ) neutrino production from electron / positron pair annihilation .",
    "these reactions , and their inverses , are implemented in our code as described by @xcite . in the following code description",
    ", we will only include emissivities , @xmath23 , and opacities , @xmath24 , because this is sufficient to describe how the collision term enters the transport and hydrodynamics equations . in the simulations ,",
    "the scattering kernels are included in the collision integral as well .",
    "the particles treated by the equation of state are assumed to react with each other on very short time scales such that a description in terms of an instantaneous equilibrium is appropriate .",
    "neutrinos in high - density regimes can also achieve local thermal and weak equilibrium with matter if the opacities are sufficiently high .",
    "unlike the equilibrium with respect to the strong interaction , however , this equilibrium must be determined within our solution of the transport equation .",
    "for example , in the protoneutron star at densities above @xmath25 g @xmath26 and temperatures above @xmath27 k the neutrinos are trapped and are well - described by a fermi - gas in thermal equilibrium with the fluid . at lower densities , the thermalization time scale becomes longer ; then the neutrinos can propagate with a nonequilibrium spectrum throughout these regions , to be absorbed elsewhere or leave the star .",
    "the strong coupling of the neutrinos to the matter at high densities and the strong coupling between different locations mediated by neutrino transport complicates the evolution of a numerical solution . if the problem is separated into independently updated pieces by operator splitting , the numerical solution will only be stable if information in the numerical implementation is shared faster between the independent updates than in the evaluated physical processes .",
    "the fast time scale of neutrino - matter interactions and the propagation of neutrinos at light speed may severely restrict the time step .",
    "the required coupling can be built directly into the numerical scheme by an implicit finite differencing of essential parts of the transport equation .",
    "unfortunately , such a differencing requires knowledge of the derivatives of the collision term with respect to all independent state variables  i.e . , density , temperature , electron fraction , and neutrino distribution functions .",
    "because the emissivities , opacities , and scattering kernels strongly depend on the neutrino energies and , in the scattering case , on the neutrino propagation directions , the numerical evaluation of the collision term and its derivatives becomes a nonnegligible part of the overall computational effort .",
    "@xcite developed a storage scheme that allows the reuse of previously calculated emissivities , opacities , and scattering kernels by linear interpolation within a dynamical table in the independent variables of logarithmic density , @xmath28 , logarithmic temperature , @xmath29 , and electron fraction , @xmath22 .",
    "if one uses these same independent variables in the implicit formulation of the boltzmann equation , the correct partial derivatives of the reactions directly emerge from the coefficients of the linear interpolation , without additional computational effort . on the one hand ,",
    "the reuse of previously evaluated interactions is straightforward if the transport equation is solved in the rest frame of the fluid , such that no transformation of the neutrino energy or angle dependence of the interactions is required . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport equations are simpler in the laboratory frame . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that in the case of spherical symmetry the complexity of the transport equation is manageable and proceed with the analysis in a comoving frame ( spacetime coordinates and neutrino four - momentum ) to take advantage of the simplifications in the collision term . on average",
    ", we have to evaluate new collision integrals in about two to three zones per time step ( out of a hundred zones ) .",
    "although these numbers depend very much on the specific phase of the simulation , the evaluation of nuclear physics input may still take about half of the total execution time .",
    "many spherically symmetric simulations of compact objects have been approached in comoving orthogonal coordinates @xcite .",
    "finite difference schemes of varying complexity were designed in @xcite , culminating in an approximate riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the left - hand side of the einstein field equation , the einstein tensor , is based on the metric @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the areal radius and @xmath32 is a label corresponding to an enclosed rest mass ( the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath32 : @xmath33 ) .",
    "the proper time lapse of a comoving observer is related to the coordinate time @xmath34 by the lapse function @xmath35 .",
    "we have made the substitution @xmath36 , based on a function @xmath37 , for the space - space component of the metric .",
    "the angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe a two - sphere .",
    "we use natural units such that the velocity of light , @xmath40 , and the gravitational constant , @xmath41 , become @xmath42 .",
    "the right - hand side of the einstein equations is given by the fluid- and radiation stress - energy tensor , @xmath16 . in a comoving orthonormal basis , it has the components @xcite@xmath43 the total energy is expressed in terms of the rest mass density , @xmath15 , the specific internal fluid energy , @xmath44 , and the specific radiation energy , @xmath45 .",
    "the isotropic fluid pressure is denoted by @xmath5 , and the radiation stress is composed from the zeroth ( @xmath45 ) and second ( @xmath46 ) angular moments of the radiation intensity .",
    "radial net energy transport is accounted for by the nondiagonal component of the stress - energy tensor , the first angular moment ( @xmath47 ) of the specific radiation intensity .",
    "we define a velocity @xmath48 , equivalent to the @xmath31 component of the fluid four - velocity as observed from a frame at constant areal radius @xmath31 @xcite , and identify the total energy enclosed in a sphere with the gravitational mass , @xmath49 . in the special relativistic limit",
    ", @xmath50 then becomes the lorentz factor corresponding to the boost between inertial and comoving observers .",
    "as in nonrelativistic hydrodynamics we can define a specific volume , @xmath51 , specific energy , @xmath1 , and specific radial momentum , @xmath52 , by@xmath53 it has been shown in @xcite that these definitions lead to conservation equations ( [ eq_continuity])-([eq_momentum ] ) that are analogous to the continuity equation , the conservation of total energy , and the conservation of radial momentum ) and the isotropic approximation has exactly the same form as the artificial viscosity tensor introduced in the same reference to numerically stabilize shock fronts .",
    "hence , in all derivations in the above reference we may simply use the pressure @xmath54 for the isotropic part and set the viscosity coefficient , @xmath55 , to @xmath56 , in order to obtain a description of radiation hydrodynamics that extends to the case where large radiation energies do not satisfy @xmath57 . ] :    @xmath58   & = & \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial a}\\left [ 4\\pi r^{2}\\alpha u\\right ] \\label{eq_continuity } \\\\",

    "we confirm this in section [ subsection_resolution ] in a comparison with a dynamical run discretized with @xmath166 angular bins . in the regions of free streaming , where numerical angular diffusion becomes apparent ,",
    "the neutrino field is already decoupled from the matter and does not influence the dynamical evolution anymore .      for the check of the observer corrections , we go back to the original solution at @xmath167 ms after bounce .",
    "both , the neutrino luminosities and rms energies show a discontinuity across the shock front because of the doppler effect and angular aberration . in the laboratory frame of a distant observer ,",
    "however , the radiation field should not be affected by the shock .",
    "we may therefore test the implementation of the observer corrections by transforming the electron neutrino luminosity and rms energy from our comoving frame to the rest frame .",
    "in @xcite we determined for the particle propagation angle , @xmath168 , and particle energy , @xmath169 , in schwarzschild coordinates the relationship@xmath170 where @xmath171 . assuming free outwards streaming with transport coefficients @xmath172 in the interesting region around the shock , we evaluate for the luminosity , @xmath173 , and rms energy , @xmath174 , the finite difference expression@xmath175 the result is shown in figure ( [ fig_observer.ps ] ) .",
    "the solid line is the luminosity in the rest frame according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_schwarzschild_transformation_fd ] ) .",
    "the dotted line shows the luminosity in the comoving frame for comparison .",
    "we find that the luminosity profile shows a numerical local distortion on top of the shock front .",
    "however , if we compare the left hand side values with the right hand side values , we find the expected disappearance of the discontinuity , indicating that the observer corrections in the comoving frame are well represented . the same behavior can be seen in the rms energies .",
    "we have now performed many checks of the particle transport in stationary - state situations . in this subsection",
    ", we check the dynamics of the radiation field itself .",
    "the neutrino transport in the supernova is most dynamic when the shock crosses the neutrinosphere .",
    "as soon as the shock has propagated to densities where the opacities are low enough that neutrinos can escape from the hot material behind the shock , immediate electron capture will occur to refill the emptied phase space with new electron neutrinos .",
    "a neutrino burst carries an energy of order @xmath10 erg throughout the star towards the distant observer .",
    "although the neutrino burst is not completely interaction free , it is an excellent example for a time - dependent radiation field where pulse propagation can be studied .",
    "we do this by plotting the luminosity profiles at selected times after the launch of the neutrino burst .",
    "we shift the radial coordinate , @xmath31 , in each time slice by the amount a free massless neutrino would have propagated during the time @xmath69 since bounce , @xmath176 . with an ideal numerical solution to free propagation ( and assuming a point source ) , we would expect congruent pulse shapes from each time slice at the same positions @xmath177 .",
    "figure ( [ fig_pulse.ps ] )    shows the neutrino burst with the described radius adjustment in the evolution of the @xmath14 m@xmath13 progenitor .",
    "we first observe , that the position of the pulse is fairly stationary .",
    "therefore , the pulse indeed travels with speed of light through the star .",
    "however , we also observe that the shape of the pulse broadens considerably with ongoing time . from the check of the neutrino number luminosity conservation in fig .",
    "( [ fig_fluxcheck.ps ] ) , we already know that the number and energy of the emitted neutrinos is conserved during their propagation to larger radii . the broadening is likely to occur by artificial diffusion in our numerical finite differencing scheme .",
    "indeed , from considerations in @xcite we remember that first order upwind differencing introduces a numerical diffusivity proportional to the advection speed and zone width,@xmath178 we quantify the influence of this effect to the evolution of our neutrino pulse by approximating the diffusion between the time steps with @xmath179 .",
    "we evaluate the diffusivity ( [ eq_numerical_diffusivity ] ) and the second derivative of the luminosity at the pulse peak in the first time slice .",
    "the time span @xmath180 to the next time slice gives us an estimate @xmath181 for the change of the peak luminosity .",
    "we subtract @xmath181 from the pulse height and draw a horizontal line on the right hand side in fig .",
    "( [ fig_pulse.ps ] ) at this estimated peak level for the next time slice .",
    "the close to perfect agreement with the numerically evolved pulse height leads to the conclusion that the diffusivity ( [ eq_numerical_diffusivity ] ) introduced with the low order advection scheme fully accounts for the observed pulse broadening .",
    "the resolution study in the next section illustrates that this is the dominant effect .      in spite of our ambition to produce accurate results already at low resolution , the reader has been left wondering about the actual resolution dependence of our data . in this subsection",
    ", we demonstrate reasonable convergence of our results by separately doubling the resolution in each phase space dimension in otherwise identical simulations . historically , our standard resolution with @xmath182 adaptive zones , @xmath165 angular bins , and @xmath166 energy groups formed as the minimum resolution where we felt safe about our physical conclusions . in fig .",
    "( [ fig_resolution ] )    we compare the results with a simulation that uses @xmath183 adaptive zones , one that uses @xmath166 angular bins , and one that uses @xmath184 energy groups .",
    "we focus on the quantities and instances where we find the largest deviations .",
    "we start with two limitations that are well - known .",
    "graph ( a ) shows the mean flux factor at @xmath140 ms after bounce in the neutrino heating phase .",
    "it can clearly be seen , that the run with @xmath166 angular bins determines the flux factor with more accuracy in the free streaming limit @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution determines how close to the radial direction the most forward peaked angular bins are .",
    "the closer they are the larger is the asymptotic limit of the flux factor . in graph ( b ) , we show another previously documented effect @xcite . in the last half of a millisecond before bounce , insufficient resolution of the energy phase space leads to a poor representation of the fermi energy in the degenerate neutrino gas when the trapped neutrinos are compressed to high densities .",
    "the consequence are rapid and transient local displacements of neutrinos . at poor energy resolution",
    ", the fermi energies rather increase in steps than continuously , and the neutrino fluxes try to balance the numerical variations in the fermi energies between adjacent zones .",
    "therefore , the effect is best seen in the electron neutrino luminosities as shown in graph ( b ) . while the conserved lepton number can not show numerical variations , the electron fraction and neutrino abundances also reflect the transient steps in the fermi energies .",
    "variations in these quantities are of order @xmath185 .",
    "however , because the neutrinos are trapped and because our scheme is conservative , this transient wiggles do not lead to any differences that survive bounce .    this is shown in the two graphs ( c ) and ( d ) at bounce where the entropy and luminosity profile , respectively , have again converged with respect to energy resolution . at this stage , we detect an influence of the spatial resolution . during collapse , there is no special region with a high concentration of grid points . at bounce , however , the grid points speed inwards to resolve the newborn shock wave .",
    "we detect an effect of this rapid grid displacement in the entropy and electron neutrino luminosity profiles to the extent shown in graphs ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "differences in the entropies can also be seen at the interface between the silicon layer and nuclear statistical equilibrium at a radius @xmath186 km .",
    "the difference is of no concern because it stems from the granular triggering of zone conversions from silicon to nse .",
    "each run determines autonomously when output files are dumped . for a given time , we then compare the output with the closest available output files in other runs .",
    "hence , it can happen that the conversion of a zone took already place in one run , but not in another one .",
    "the location of the transition to nse shows an uncertainty of at least one zone width .",
    "the first @xmath187 ms after bounce are probably the most dynamical time in the simulations . at this time",
    "we find again the most prominent resolution dependencies in the entropy and luminosity profiles .",
    "it is still a dependency on the space resolution alone .",
    "the entropy in the high energy resolution run carries the slight enhancement from before , overlapped by a slightly narrower and deeper cooling at the launch of the neutrino burst .",
    "the higher luminosity peak in graph ( f ) at higher spatial resolution comes not unexpectedly , as we have seen in subsection [ subsection_pulse_propagation ] that the decay of the outwards propagating neutrino burst depends on the zone width .",
    "we can also demonstrate by this resolution study , that the described pulse spreading does only marginally depend on the angular resolution .",
    "note that the apparent difference in the run with higher energy resolution is not a real difference , it stems from an insufficient time match between the output files and shows the rapidly decaying luminosity profile at a slightly earlier time .",
    "finally , we compare the runs with different resolutions during the important neutrino heating phase , e.g. at @xmath140 ms after bounce . graphs ( g ) and ( h ) show again the entropy and luminosity profiles .",
    "we are happy to report that the simulations are converged at this stage . with the exception of the slightly higher entropy in the outer layers of the high space resolution run",
    ", none of the previously discussed differences has survived to this time . moreover ,",
    "the quality of agreement presented in these graphs is similar to what we find in the velocity , logarithmic density , electron fraction , and rms neutrino energy profiles at any time during the simulations .",
    "we conclude that convergence issues are far from affecting our physical conclusions from the simulations .",
    "only if one asks for high precision numbers in specific quantities , we may , with descending importance , recommend an increase of space- , energy- , and angle - resolution .",
    "after having put much effort into the consistent finite differencing of the transport equation in favor of an accurate evolution of expectation values , we investigate in this section the energy conservation properties in the most challenging run started from the massive @xmath14 m@xmath13 progenitor star .",
    "our scheme preserves lepton numbers to machine precision by construction . in fig .",
    "( [ fig_energy1 ] )    we show how the total energy in the simulation divides up into different energy forms during the simulation .",
    "the gravitational energy ( thin solid line in the lower part of the figure ) and the internal energy of the fluid ( thin solid line in the upper part of the figure ) form the largest contributions . for this figure",
    ", we have set the undetermined constant in the internal energy such that the total energy vanishes at the start of the simulation .",
    "the energy stored in neutrinos ( dash - dotted line ) grows with respect to the internal fluid energy until bounce .",
    "afterwards , it evolves almost proportionally to the internal fluid energy .",
    "the kinetic energy ( thin dashed line ) also grows during collapse .",
    "it peaks at bounce and settles on a lower level afterwards , slightly decaying during the stationary postbounce phase because of the decreasing density of infalling material .",
    "the dotted line at the center of the figure is the work exerted on the surface of the computational domain .",
    "the thick dashed line is the accumulated energy emitted by neutrinos .",
    "its steep increase around bounce is delayed with respect to the other energy contributions because of the delay in the neutrino burst and the propagation time to the surface of the computational domain at @xmath188 km radius .",
    "the thick solid line represents the evolution of the total energy in our simulation .",
    "it is very accurately conserved during the core collapse phase .",
    "it shows a perturbation of order @xmath189 erg in the most dynamic phase around bounce when the grid points rush to the center to resolve the shock front .",
    "it systematically increases afterwards and reaches the order of an explosion energy at the end of the simulation when the neutron star collapses to a black hole .",
    "we further investigate this energy violation in the next two figures .",
    "we would obtain energy conservation to machine precision if we could enforce perfect cancellation in the six chains discussed after eq .",
    "( [ eq_cancellation_table ] ) , i.e. @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "the hydrodynamics scheme is designed to absorb the energy exchange by the collision integral to machine precision and conserve energy perfectly , even on the adaptive grid . by selecting only the positive contributions in the canceling terms",
    "we obtain a measure of the importance for an accurate cancellation . after an integration over the computational domain , fig .",
    "( [ fig_energy2 ] )    illustrates this measure for the six above - mentioned expressions with a thick dashed line , a thick solid line , a dash - dotted line , a dotted line , a thin dashed line , and a thin solid line , respectively .",
    "after bounce , the maximum individual contribution to the energy conservation equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_radiation_energy_conservation ] ) reaches a typical level of @xmath196 erg / s .",
    "( [ fig_energy2 ] ) makes immediately evident that maintaining accurate energy conservation is more challenging after bounce than before bounce .",
    "moreover , we note that the o@xmath2 terms @xmath190 and @xmath191 are much larger than the higher order terms @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    nevertheless , these terms are perfectly matched in our implementation .",
    "violation of energy conservation therefore stems from the terms @xmath194 ( the matching is tuned for an isotropic neutrino distribution ) and @xmath197 ( the matching is based on an energy flux averaging ) as discussed in the context of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_gmu_fd ] ) and ( [ eq_ge_fd ] ) respectively . in section [ subsection_adaptive_grid ]",
    "we have discussed energy conservation violations by the adaptive grid corrections when they are applied to the radiation quantities . where do they enter the conservation check ? if we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq_radiation_energy_conservation ] ) on the adaptive grid according to the recipe in eq .",
    "( [ eq_reynolds_theorem_fd ] ) , we note that the integration of the energy over the whole star reduces the adaptive grid corrections to surface terms .",
    "these surface terms vanish because the grid velocity is zero at the center and the surface of the star . if we compare with the more detailed eq .",
    "( [ eq_cancellation_table ] ) we find that this time derivative corresponds exactly to the term @xmath198 .",
    "the energy violations by the adaptive grid show only up in the terms @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "if these terms are evaluated with all the grid corrections in the time evolution of @xmath97 , @xmath48 , @xmath45 , and @xmath47 , they will numerically differ from the terms @xmath199 and @xmath200 we have used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_misner_dgdt_fd ] ) and ( [ eq_ge_fd ] ) for the approximate matching .",
    "we check the influence of the adaptive grid corrections by a comparison with a run using a pure lagrangian grid , where no adaptive grid corrections can compromise energy conservation .",
    "however , in order to get enough resolution in the run with the fixed grid , we had to run with @xmath167 spatial zones instead of the @xmath182 we used with the adaptive grid .",
    "this run is extremely slow . on the one hand ,",
    "the solution vector is four times larger .",
    "but much more important is that every single zone has to change its value from the preshock conditions to the postshock conditions in the allowed @xmath201-change steps .",
    "this requires an almost @xmath187 times smaller time step than with the adaptive grid , where a zone can follow the shock . in the latter case ,",
    "the conditions in the zone changes on a much longer time scale determined by the drift between the zone speed and the shock propagation . in order to let a run",
    "reach the interesting phase around @xmath140 ms after bounce in reasonable time , we had to reduce the angular resolution to only two angular bins . both measures , the increase of spatial and time resolution and the decrease of angular resolution can in principle affect energy conservation .",
    "nevertheless , we hope to get the correct impression of the influence of the adaptive grid on the energy conservation .",
    "the two terms @xmath199 and @xmath200 of the lagrangian run are also shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_energy3 ] ) ( thin lines ) .",
    "we find that the order of magnitude of energy violation in the cancellation @xmath194 does not significantly change on the fixed grid .",
    "however , the cancellation in the term @xmath197 is greatly reduced on the fixed grid .",
    "this suggests that the adaptive grid corrections of the radiation quantities are the dominant remaining sources of energy violation , about five times larger than the mismatch in @xmath194 .",
    "the absolute necessity of accurate energy conservation may be discussed .",
    "but certainly , it provided an invaluable check for the congruence between the programmers intention and the actual implementation of the many intricate finite difference expressions in our code .",
    "following our tradition @xcite , we conclude this paper with a comparison with simulations using the multi - group flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) approximation .",
    "we note that , excepting the pioneering boltzmann solver of @xcite , codes with mgfld currently provide the only alternative numerical data for the evolution of a supernova in full general relativity @xcite .",
    "we compare the evolution of a @xmath12 m@xmath13 progenitor @xcite .",
    "this is a stellar model with a small iron core which  in the hope of seeing an explosion in numerical simulations  has been used throughout the supernova literature .",
    "questions concerning the accuracy of the mgfld approximation in the dynamic semi - transparent region between the neutrino sphere and the heating region have been posed and answered in several studies with different flux limiters ( in the supernova context e.g. @xcite ) . for general relativistic mgfld simulations @xcite bruenn developed a new flux limiter that consists of two parts @xcite :",
    "the first part is a specific implementation of the usual scheme for interpolating between the optically thick diffusion regime and the optically thin free streaming regime , namely@xmath202 where @xmath203 is the total energy - dependent transport mean free path .",
    "this ensures that@xmath204 in the diffusion limit , and that @xmath205 in the free streaming limit .",
    "this part alone suffers from the generic problem of too rapid a transition to the free streaming limit when matter goes from optically thick to optically thin abruptly . to avoid this problem ,",
    "a second piece of the flux limiter is constructed .",
    "it basically prevents the neutrino angular distribution from becoming more forward peaked than the geometrical limit . at radius @xmath31 ,",
    "the second part depends on the radius of the neutrinosphere , @xmath206 , and is given by@xmath207",
    "where@xmath208 and@xmath209 the quantity @xmath0 is the cosine of the angle from the limb of the neutrinosphere to the point at @xmath31 , corrected for gravitational bending , and @xmath210 is that same angle as seen in the fluid frame .",
    "the net diffusivity in the diffusion equation is then set by the minimum of the two parts of the flux limiter,@xmath211 in the following , we compare bruenn s mgfld simulation with this flux limiter to the solution we have obtained by the complete solution of the transport equation . beside of the different methods implemented for the radiation transport , the two codes also use different schemes to solve the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "while the code described in this paper adapts to spatial resolution requirements by continuously displacing zones , the mgfld code adjusts the resolution by occasionally inserting or removing zones .",
    "it uses of order @xmath141 zones at bounce and @xmath212 zones half a second after bounce , while agile - boltztran works with @xmath182 zones throughout . the energy resolution in mgfld",
    "is given by @xmath136 groups which adapt to the general relativistic redshift .",
    "in the boltzmann solver , we used @xmath166 fixed energy groups .",
    "we start with the comparison of a time slice at bounce in figure ( [ fig_bounce.ps ] ) .",
    "the ordinates of graphs ( a - h ) display the enclosed mass . at the end of core collapse , we find differences in the density profiles in graph ( b ) of @xmath213 at the center , and less than @xmath201 in the inner core . differences of up to @xmath214 around the shock front are due to a different resolution of the shock . outside of the shock , we find a @xmath215 lower density in agile - boltztran .",
    "the shock position , however , is in reasonable agreement as shown in the velocity profiles in graph ( a ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the agreement in the thermodynamical state within the homologous inner core up to the sonic point at an enclosed mass of @xmath216 m@xmath13 .",
    "differences in the infall velocities are of order @xmath217 . in the diffusive domain , we find agreement in the entropies of order @xmath185 ( graph ( c ) ) . around an enclosed mass of @xmath218 m@xmath13 , however , the deviations are systematic and of order @xmath219",
    ". at least part of it is due to a narrow choice of the spatial resolution in agile - boltztran as discussed in section [ subsection_resolution ] .",
    "immediately connected to the entropy profile is the temperature profile in graph ( f ) .",
    "the temperature is very sensitive to entropy differences in the degenerate high density material .",
    "the electron fractions in graph ( d ) differ typically by @xmath220 .",
    "the maximum deviation of @xmath221 is found where the entropy deviation is largest . at lower densities than @xmath222 g/@xmath18",
    ", the dominant source of neutrinos is provided by electron capture on heavy nuclei .",
    "as the mass fraction of heavy nuclei is not very temperature dependent , the entropy difference only affects the deleptonization by the dependence of the electron capture rates .",
    "agile - boltztran finds a slightly lower electron fraction in this regime . at densities exceeding @xmath222 g/@xmath18 ,",
    "however , standard input physics used to prematurely switch off electron captures on heavy nuclei in the oversimplified independent particle model @xcite such that electron captures on free protons became dominant in the simulations compared here .",
    "the lower entropy in the simulation with agile - boltztran leads to a smaller mass fraction of free protons and reduced deleptonization with respect to the mgfld simulation .",
    "the slightly larger electron abundance between @xmath223 and @xmath218 m@xmath13 is a consequence .",
    "the agreement in the luminosities in graph ( e ) is of order @xmath224 .",
    "the solution in the diffusive domain is smoother in agile - boltztran because the expanding zones of the adaptive grid equilibrate local discontinuities introduced by the equation of state .",
    "in contrast to these random fluctuations inside the shock front , we find a systematic deviation of @xmath224 in the luminosities outside of the shock front .",
    "this difference might also be a consequence of the lower entropy in agile - boltztran .",
    "the neutrino rms energies ( graph ( h ) ) in the inner core are determined by thermal equilibrium . there , the agreement is to @xmath213 . outside of the shock front , the deviation is initially more around @xmath217 , before it becomes better again towards very large radii .",
    "the mean flux factor , the ratio of neutrino flux over neutrino density , @xmath225 , in graph ( g ) shows differences of order @xmath163 at this time .",
    "the smaller flux factor of the mgfld neutrinos at an enclosed mass of about @xmath218 m@xmath13 is probably due to increased isotropic neutrino emission at the higher entropy .",
    "it leads to slightly higher luminosities and higher rms energies , and is consistent with the smaller electron fraction .",
    "we should note here that it is very typical for such comparisons that each code presents an itself consistent picture of the dynamics such that it is sometimes almost impossible to isolate a single cause for a difference in the strongly coupled variables .",
    "the smaller flux factor in agile - boltztran outside @xmath226 m@xmath13 stems from the limited angular resolution discussed in section ( [ subsection_anglecheck ] ) .",
    "it is systematic and visible in all the following figures .",
    "its impact on the dynamics , however , is negligible because of the small coupling between the neutrino flux and matter at large radii .",
    "figure ( [ fig_burst.ps ] )    shows a time slice just after the launch of the neutrino burst .",
    "this is the most dynamical phase for the radiation transport .",
    "the neutrino burst in graph ( e ) is evident in both codes as a propagating peak in the luminosity profile .",
    "the peak at @xmath161 km radius is broader and by @xmath227 smaller in agile - boltztran because of the numerical diffusion we have analyzed in section [ subsection_pulse_propagation ] .",
    "the mgfld burst changes its shape more slowly because the mgfld code reverts , in the transparent regime , to centered difference advection ( rather than first order upwind ) which is second order accurate in space ( on a uniform spatial grid ) .",
    "the luminosity in the region between the shock and the luminosity peak decays very rapidly .",
    "differences of order @xmath224 are due to a small time mismatch between the two solutions . inside the shock front ,",
    "the luminosity is still much noisier in the mgfld solution .",
    "this is also true for the entropy profile in graph ( c ) , where local differences of @xmath163 behind the shock or @xmath228 at @xmath167 km radius , disturb the otherwise nice agreement of order @xmath185 .",
    "note however , that the temperature profiles in graph ( f ) is less sensitive to this entropy variation .",
    "the temperature difference at @xmath167 km radius is @xmath229 .",
    "the agreement in the infall velocities in graph ( a ) has improved to generally @xmath220 agreement with the exception of @xmath230 around @xmath167 km radius , i.e. the region with the entropy differences .",
    "the entropy deviations inside the shock front and at @xmath167 km radius cause density differences of @xmath227 in these regions .",
    "the central density agrees to @xmath201 and the agreement in the very distant layers is of order @xmath213 .",
    "the electron fraction profile is affected by the numerical noise as well .",
    "deviations , however , are only of order @xmath220 , with local exceptions showing differences of @xmath219 .",
    "the rms energies in graph ( h ) typically agree to @xmath185 .",
    "the differences in the flux factors in graph ( g ) show systematic deviations of @xmath219 outside of @xmath140 km radius and random fluctuations of order @xmath163 interior to it .",
    "the latter are probably a consequence of the variations in the density and entropy profiles .",
    "most important for the success or failure of the supernova explosion in our spherically symmetric simulations is the time @xmath231 ms after bounce .",
    "though , we have to state clearly that the general relativistic runs are not failing marginally .",
    "they are failing with officious insistence , and differences of the size we have described above are far from changing this , as we will show with the next two time slices .",
    "figure ( [ fig_heat.ps ] )    shows the comparison of the two simulations at @xmath140 ms after bounce , when the efficiency of the neutrino heating is close to maximum .",
    "the agreement of the data in this phase is remarkable . in this quasi - stationary phase ,",
    "the position of the stalled shock is in accurate agreement as one can see in graph ( a ) .",
    "we note however , that the important infall velocity in the heating region ( e.g. at @xmath140 km radius ) is @xmath219 larger in mgfld than in agile - boltztran .",
    "since this infall velocity determines the time the infalling matter spends in the heating region before being accreted onto the protoneutron star , its value is as relevant as the heating rate .",
    "better visible in the graph are the differences in the infall velocity which have only a size of @xmath213 .",
    "again , they reflect differences in the entropy profile in graph ( c ) . outside the shock the entropy deviations of order @xmath163 seem large . however , they correspond to temperature variations of only @xmath219 and are explicable by the assumption of instantaneous silicon burning in agile - boltztran .",
    "mgfld uses a @xmath232 species nuclear network to burn nuclei to iron until the temperature exceeds @xmath233 k , at which point the zone is flashed to nse . inside the shock front ,",
    "the agreement in the entropies is good to @xmath220 ( except for some local fluctuations in the mgfld solution in the heating region ) . as the rise in entropy between the shock front and the location at @xmath140 km",
    "radius is entirely due to neutrino heating , this is an encouraging result . in this time slice , we have replaced the temperature graph ( f ) with a graph of the more important heating rates .",
    "plotted is the sum of the heating rates by electron neutrino absorption and electron antineutrino absorption .",
    "the rate is negative in the cooling region , representing cooling rates by the inverse processes , electron capture and positron capture .",
    "we find @xmath234 difference in the heating region and @xmath219 difference in the cooling region .",
    "the values in the mgfld simulation are larger .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the larger electron antineutrino luminosity in graph ( e ) and the larger infall velocity behind the shock in graph ( a ) .",
    "the electron fraction profiles in graph ( d ) agree to @xmath220 accuracy with the exception of two local @xmath217 deviations at @xmath157 km and @xmath235 km radius , where the electron fraction is as small as @xmath236 .",
    "this close agreement in the entropy and electron fraction leads to a similar thermodynamical state of the fluid in the inner core .",
    "good agreement in the nearly hydrostatic density profile in graph ( b ) is the consequence .",
    "differences are @xmath237 at the center and on average around @xmath185 up to a radius of @xmath167 km .",
    "further out , differences stemming from the silicon / iron layer interface are visible .",
    "the good agreement in the density profiles facilitates the comparison of other density - dependent quantities .",

    "this is just inverse to the relation between the rms energies .",
    "while , for example , an increase in the rms energy contributes only linearly towards a luminosity increase , the neutrino flux , however , is determined by the quadratically decreasing mean free path . where the flux factors in graph ( g ) are below @xmath238 , they are typically @xmath185 lower in mgfld . between this domain and the shock front ( including the heating region )",
    "the flux factors show on average no discernible deviation , but fluctuations of @xmath239 are evident .",
    "the flux factors in agile - boltztran disagree with the asymptotic limit , @xmath240 , by @xmath241 at distant radii due to the limitation in angular resolution as discussed in subsections [ subsection_anglecheck ] and [ subsection_resolution ] .",
    "similar agreements and differences are found in later stages of the quasistationary phase , e.g. at @xmath167 ms after bounce ( fig .",
    "( [ fig_moreretract.ps ] ) ) .",
    "we find again hotter neutrinos between the neutrino sphere and the shock position in the mgfld simulation and a larger diffusive flux at very high densities in agile - boltztran . on a longer time scale ,",
    "the latter leads to a marginally larger deleptonization , visible in the innermost @xmath242 km of the electron fraction profile .",
    "the electron fraction in agile - boltztran is now @xmath220 smaller , whereas it was @xmath220 larger early after bounce .",
    "a new difference of @xmath217 appears in the peak of the entropy profile , which might be due to differences in the hydrodynamics scheme for the solution of the shock jump conditions .",
    "we also point to the fact that the resolution of the shock in this stage is quite poor .",
    "the thin marks at the top of graph ( a ) represent the grid point locations in the agile - boltztran simulation .",
    "most of the grid points cluster around the forming density cliff between @xmath136 km and @xmath155 km radius .",
    "a high resolution in this domain is important for the radiation transport because most neutrinos are emitted from the cliff .",
    "however , this leaves less grid points to focus on the shock front .",
    "graph ( a ) shows only a small increase of the grid point concentration at the shock front .",
    "the infall velocities inside the shock in graph ( a ) have increased to @xmath188 km / s . at this speed ,",
    "the infalling material is only very shortly exposed to neutrino heating .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the entropy increase from the shock to the peak entropy is only marginal in both runs . without unaccounted effects ,",
    "a shock revival is impossible under these conditions .",
    "the most significant new differences appear in the luminosity and rms energy profiles .",
    "mgfld has now consistently smaller luminosities and higher rms energies .",
    "the differences are @xmath163 in the luminosities and unchanged @xmath217 in the rms energies in the heating region . also interesting to note",
    "is that the rms energies agree perfectly right outside the shock at @xmath140 km radius , and develop deviations of @xmath243 at far distances .",
    "there might be small differences in the implementation of the observer corrections .",
    "the flux factors in graph ( g ) are more difficult to compare , because the neutrinos no longer decouple at exactly the same radius .",
    "the flux factor in agile - boltztran is still numerically limited in its asymptote , while the flux factor in mgfld exhibits somewhat peculiar fluctuations in the heating region .",
    "overall , in our general relativistic simulations of stellar core collapse and postbounce evolution in spherically symmetric space - time , we find quite exactly the same physical evolution in both runs .",
    "one implementing the full boltzmann transport equation , and the other based on the multi - group flux - limited diffusion approximation with a new sophisticated flux limiter .",
    "this is especially true in all phases of stationary radiation transport .",
    "there are modest quantitative differences in these simulations of failed supernovae .",
    "however , except for some obvious cases , like e.g. the limited asymptotic flux factor in agile - boltztran , or the numerical fluctuations that the equation of state induces to purely lagrangian hydrodynamics in mgfld , these quantitative differences can not uniquely be traced back to principal weaknesses or strengths of either method .",
    "they may rather be due to method - specific details in the implementation of two very different methods to solve a complex time - dependent physical problem .",
    "the advantage of the boltzmann solution is that it is complete , and , beside of numerical resolution , does not need to justify or verify any basic assumptions .",
    "the advantage of mgfld is the transparency of the approach , and that it produces accurate results with much higher efficiency in the application we have tested here .",
    "agile - boltztran directly solves the general relativistic boltzmann transport equation for the specific neutrino distribution function in spherically symmetric space - time . in combination with general relativistic hydrodynamics ,",
    "we present a consistent finite differencing for fermion radiation hydrodynamics in spherical symmetry .",
    "we test our code in the context of stellar core collapse and postbounce evolution of a smaller @xmath12 m@xmath13 , and a more massive @xmath14 m@xmath13 progenitor star .",
    "they embrace the progenitor mass range expected to produce explosions after core collapse . but",
    "no explosions are obtained in our simulations .",
    "we analyze the regions of neutrino emission by a statistical description allowing the detailed presentation of the specific production reactions and energies of escaping neutrinos .",
    "the boltzmann transport equation plays a fundamental role in kinetic gas theory .",
    "one may derive from it the diffusion equation , or  if one drives the limit further to vanishing transport  the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "thermodynamical quantities are given by the expectation values of various operators on the fundamental particle distribution functions .",
    "it is quite unique to numerically solve a single equation for the fundamental particle distribution functions in an object of astronomical size !",
    "however , this basic approach becomes intricate in the detailed finite difference representation . in theory",
    ", the solution of the boltzmann equation guarantees the correct evolution of expectation values in the energy conservation equation or the diffusion limit .",
    "also the equation of state for radiation , @xmath244 will emerge correctly .",
    "this is not automatically the case in a numerically solved boltzmann equation . especially in the astrophysical application",
    ", a distant observer will rather observe macroscopic phenomena than the microscopic local state of the matter and the radiation field .",
    "therefore we compose the finite difference representation of the microscopic physics such that important macroscopic quantities are accurately met .",
    "this optimizes the accuracy of the simulations at moderate resolution settings . however , it would be more straightforward to comply with this ambition if there would not be an additional complication . physically ,",
    "the boltzmann transport equation is a trivial equation , describing free particle propagation on geodesics between independent collisions ( even more so in spherical symmetry , where only two independent spatial degrees of freedom have to be considered ) . with respect to the collisions",
    ", the supernova has been investigated as a site of interesting nuclear physics and neutrino - matter interactions .",
    "the cross sections depend on the local neutrino energies and scattering angles .",
    "they are most conveniently evaluated in the fluid rest frame and most easily described in combination with comoving coordinates .",
    "the latter are also favored by the initial core collapse where the relevant computational domain collapses with the matter from several thousands to some hundreds of kilometer radius , before it hopefully expands again with the explosion .",
    "the comoving coordinates convert the simple statement of the boltzmann equation , that the derivative of the invariant particle distribution function along the phase flow vanishes between collisions , into a complicated sum of partial derivatives along the comoving coordinates .",
    "the finite differencing of all comoving frame correction terms have to be adjusted in a mutually dependent way to correctly transform to conservation equations for the observer in a laboratory frame .",
    "we construct number conservation to be guaranteed . with respect to energy conservation , we match the largest o@xmath245 terms to machine precision , while higher order gravitational terms are matched approximately , guided by specific limiting cases .",
    "the adaptive grid applied to the neutrino distribution function in the comoving frame introduces additional deviations from perfect energy conservation in the laboratory frame . in the worst case ,",
    "i.e. in the evolution of the very massive @xmath14 m@xmath13 progenitor star , all these deviations together reach the order of a supernova explosion energy ( @xmath246 erg ) at the time the protoneutron star collapses to a black hole .",
    "however , when the conditions are most favorable for an explosion ( we should rather say least unfavorable ) , the numerical energy gain has not yet exceeded @xmath247 erg and we are confident that the remaining energy drift does not influence our physical conclusions .",
    "we have also tested the implementation of the gravitational redshift and bending , the angular advection in the free streaming regime , and the propagation of the neutrino burst . quite generally , we find that the choice of first order upwind differencing is the limiting factor for the accuracy in our numerical solution . in space",
    ", it causes artificial pulse spreading . in the advection terms of the adaptive grid",
    ", it causes artificial diffusion . in momentum space",
    ", it causes angular diffusion in the evolution of the particle distribution function .",
    "although these limitations can be reduced by the choice of higher resolution , more elaborate advection schemes could generally be beneficial for the accuracy of the simulations . with an investigation of the resolution dependence of the results in each phase space dimension , however , we demonstrate that our physical results are sufficiently converged in the supernova application .",
    "the undesired effects of low order upwind differencing predominantly affect the regions far from the neutrinospheres , where the radiation field is decoupled from the matter such that an adverse influence on the dynamics of the model can be excluded .",
    "we derived the moments entering the energy conservation equation .",
    "moreover , we algebraically derived the finite difference representation of the diffusive limit , the nonrelativistic limit , and the radial dependence of the radiation quantities in a stationary state free streaming radiation field .",
    "these algebraic gymnastics led to a better understanding of the internal mechanisms in our finite difference representation and , by comparison with the code results , enhanced the confidence that the implementation exactly corresponds to the programmer s intention . in order to perform simulations over a second or more ,",
    "the radiation transport and hydrodynamics have been implemented with implicit finite differencing .",
    "this allows reasonably sized time steps during the neutrino heating phase .",
    "finally we compared the evolution of a @xmath12 m@xmath13 star with an independently implemented general relativistic supernova code which applies the multi - group flux - limited diffusion approximation with a recently developed flux limiter @xcite .",
    "we find significant agreement that is especially impressive in the neutrino heating phase .",
    "other phases show regions with moderate deviations , but those are far from affecting any physical conclusions .    with the exponentially growing power of computer hardware ,",
    "computational astrophysics may reach a comparable status in astronomical , nuclear and particle physics research as terrestrial experiments have received in the previous century .",
    "we may sort scientific progress into three phases : first , the astronomical observation or a new theoretical concept lead to a primary idea about the basic physics involved in an event . at this stage ,",
    "order of magnitude estimates are made and compared to the qualitative observational data .",
    "the second step involves plausibility studies of the suggested scenario , which may include detailed numerical simulations and comparisons to observations .",
    "often , however , approximations have to be used that are dictated by technical limitations in the newly developing field .",
    "only in the simplest cases it can be shown that all assumptions are based on undeniably justifiable physical considerations .",
    "this exciting phase of discovery and controversy should be followed by more rigorous numerical simulations in a third step , when technical limitations fade and remaining approximations become quantifiable .",
    "this phase has to be accompanied by code documentation that allows independent researchers to analyze and eventually reproduce the numerical results , similar to the way the value of experimental data is enhanced by a detailed description of the reproduceable experiment .",
    "the recent emergence of functional boltzmann solvers leads the radiation hydrodynamics in spherically symmetric supernova models into this third phase . the third phase , by principle ,",
    "should be accompanied by solid agreement in the numerical solution found with independent implementations of the same physical ingredients . in order to perform such comparisons",
    ", we appreciate the situation that a basic set of standard nuclear and weak interaction physics has been defined and used for over @xmath248 years ( e.g. @xcite ) . in a comparison with the second phase ",
    "which used the former standard scheme for neutrino transport in supernovae  multi - group flux - limited diffusion , we hope to increase the confidence in our results . on the other hand ,",
    "we support the validity of the mgfld approximation in spherical symmetry if the flux limiter is chosen carefully .",
    "as satisfying as these close results are , they should not be mistaken as an example of convergence to agreement in the sense of the third phase . the third phase is only reached if similar agreement is found between independent groups and other documented codes that solve physically complete neutrino transport equations with general relativistic effects , e.g. the variable eddington factor method implemented by @xcite .",
    "we hope that spherically symmetric simulations with neutrino radiation hydrodynamics have reached phase three and that accurate and detailed neutrino information continues to be useful for the exploration and improvement of the local microscopic input physics .",
