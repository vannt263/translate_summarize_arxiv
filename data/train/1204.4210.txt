    "the connection between the overall morphology and dynamics of galaxies and the centrally located supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) they harbor provides a fundamental constraint in the study of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one well - known example of this link is seen in the correlation between smbh mass ( @xmath1 ) and the large - scale stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) of the bulge / spheroid encompassing it ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . likewise , the discovery of a relationship between @xmath1 and spiral arm pitch angle ( @xmath0 ; seigar et al .",
    "2008 ) suggests that smbhs are tied to the overall secular evolution of a galaxy .",
    "seigar et al.(2005 , 2006 ) have already shown that there is a strong correlation between @xmath0 and rotation curve shear rate ( @xmath6 ) , where small values of @xmath0 correspond to large @xmath6 ( see their figure 3 ) and a large central mass concentration .",
    "more recent studies have further indicated that smbhs are linked to secular processes ( e.g. cisternas et al .",
    "2011 , orban de xivry et al .",
    "2011 ) .    the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge / spheroid is commonly linked to @xmath1 ( gebhardt et al . 2000",
    "; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) . for example",
    ", m33 is a bulgeless late - type galaxy with the lowest nuclear bh mass ever measured with an upper mass limit of 1500 @xmath7 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) . the discovery of smbhs in the centers of late - type galaxies with little or no bulge ( satyapal et al",
    ". 2007 , 2008 ) suggests that the size , or mass , of smbhs may be tied to the dark matter halo virial mass , or concentration ( see , e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "2007 for a relation ) .",
    "this hints at the cause of the @xmath8 connection and the reason why m33 fits in this relation .",
    "comparisons of the corrected central velocity dispersion with the maximum rotation velocity of disk galaxies also reveal a good correlation between @xmath1 and the mass of the dark matter halo ( ferrarese 2002 ) .",
    "additionally , bulge size and dark halo mass show a direct correlation in general , but the relationship exhibits a lot of scatter ( see , e.g. , ho 2007 ) .",
    "recently , booth & schaye ( 2010 ) have shown through simulations that @xmath1 appears to be linked to halo binding energy rather than the halo mass , with the central halo concentration playing a role in the relationship s scatter .",
    "other recent papers have also argued both for ( seigar 2011 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2011 ) and against ( kormendy & bender 2011 ) a coupling of smbh masses and the properties of the dark matter halo .",
    "the secular evolution of a barred spiral galaxy is chiefly influenced by the rotation rate of the non - axisymmetric component ( e.g. , lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ; kalnajs 1991 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "simulation models have shown that after a bar initially forms , the pattern speed ( @xmath9 ) remains fast when embedded in a dark matter halo with a low central density ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ) .",
    "this is due to reduced dynamical friction between the two components that would otherwise cause a rapid decrease in @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 also determines the locations of important resonance regions in galaxies with a single perturbation mode , such as a bar or grand design spiral .",
    "this allows the rotation of a bar to be described by the ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the corotation , or 1:1 , resonance ( cr ) radius and @xmath13 is the bar semimajor axis length .",
    "when @xmath14 a bar is deemed to be a fast rotator , while @xmath15 implies a slow rotating bar .",
    "theoretical arguments by contopoulos ( 1980 ) state that self - consistent bars must have @xmath16 .",
    "about 50% of all spiral galaxies display either a full , broken , or partial ring shaped pattern in their light distribution ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "although rings are observed in some non - barred galaxies , they are typically associated with barred galaxies due to the ease at which they form through bar - driven gravity torques ( see grouchy et al . 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical arguments suggest that inner rings in barred spiral galaxies are features of the inner ultraharmonic , or 4:1 , resonance ( iuhr ; schwarz 1984 ; byrd et al .",
    "athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1982 ) have discussed that for a flat rotation curve , where @xmath17 , the ratio of the outer lindblad , or 2:1 , resonance ( olr ) to iuhr radius is @xmath18 while the ratio of the olr to cr radius is @xmath19 this implies that the ratio of the cr to iuhr radius is @xmath20 since bars are encircled by inner rings , if present , @xmath13 must be similar to the inner ring radius .",
    "this suggests that @xmath21 or that bars are slow rotators in general .",
    "statistics of observational data show that the median ratio of outer to inner ring diameter is 2.2 ( buta 1995 ) or the approximate mean of the theoretical olr : iuhr and olr : cr values .",
    "if outer rings in general can be linked to the olr , this suggests a nearly even distribution of galaxies with fast or slow bars .",
    "recent evidence suggests that outer rings may not always be linked to the olr as expected though ( treuthardt et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "@xmath9 , or @xmath22 , can be estimated using a number of methods ( e.g. , canzian 1993 ; buta & combes 1996 ; puerari & dottori 1997 ; salo et al .",
    "1999 ; weiner et al . 2001 ; egusa et al . 2004",
    "; zhang & buta 2007 ) with the most direct being that of tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ; tw ) .",
    "much emphasis has been placed on this method recently but it has been suggested that morphological matching through dynamical simulations yield similar estimates while lacking the limited applicabilty of the tw method ( treuthardt et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the goal of our study is to estimate the bar pattern speeds and measure the spiral arm pitch angles of 40 barred spiral galaxies .",
    "this will indicate which of these galaxies have low central dark halo densities and provide an estimate of the central smbh mass , respectively .",
    "based on the simulation results of booth & schaye ( 2010 ) , we expect to find that for a given halo mass , smbhs in galaxies with fast bars will have a less - than - average mass due to anemic growth within the low central density dark halo .",
    "this means that the total luminous and dark mass of these galaxies ( @xmath4 ) predicted from the @xmath23 relationship ( bandara et al .",
    "2009 ) would be the minimum expected observationally measured value .",
    "we will investigate this claim with measurements of @xmath4 in a forthcoming paper .",
    "@xmath24-band images from the carnegie - irvine galaxy survey ( cgs ; ho et al .",

    "our mass models also include a dark halo component based on the universal rotation curve of persic et al .",
    "the halo profile was calculated using @xmath46 derived from hyperleda ( paturel et al .",

    "our estimate of @xmath9 , average error , and bar semimajor axis radius for this galaxy are overlayed .",
    "the radial regions where specific resonances in the linear ( epicyclic ) approximation are located are indicated where the horizontal line corresponding to @xmath9 intersects each frequency curve . for this galaxy",
    ", we estimate that the bar extends to the iuhr and not to the cr .",
    "once gravitational potentials were determined for our sample , we were also able to estimate the strength of the bar in each galaxy .",
    "this was done by calculating two dimensional maps of the radial ( @xmath48 ) and tangential ( @xmath49 ) forces .",
    "the tangential forces induced by the bar were calculated using a polar method discussed by laurikainen & salo ( 2002 ) and laurikainen et al .",
    "the polar method was applied to an azimuthal fourier decomposition of the intensity and the even components , up to m = 20 , were then converted to the corresponding potential components ( salo et al .",
    "the ratio of the maximum of @xmath49 to the azimuthally averaged @xmath48 at each radius produces a radial profile of the distance dependent maximum tangential force . the maximum of the this profile gives a single measure of the bar strength , @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath50 , however , can be affected by spiral arm torques , making it a convolution of the bar ( @xmath51 ) and spiral strength ( @xmath52 ; buta et al .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 can be thought of , at worst , as an upper limit to the true bar strength , @xmath51 .",
    "our sample of galaxies was modeled by simulating the behaviour of a two - dimensional disk of inelastically colliding ( or `` sticky '' ) , non - self - gravitating gas particles in our predetermined potentials .",
    "the details of the simulation code we used can be found in salo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and salo ( 1991 ) .",
    "the advantage of using a sticky particle code over a smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code , for example , is that it better approximates the cold gas component of a galaxy ( merlin & chiosi 2007 ) . in sph ,",
    "gas particles are subject to nongravitational forces , such as pressure gradients , making it better suited for modeling the warm gas phase .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to use sticky particle models for matching observed morphological components containing star formation , such as resonance rings and spiral arms .",
    "the overall modeling process closely followed that of treuthardt et al .",
    "for example , we produced snapshots of 100,000 gas particles at the bar rotation period of interest by simulating the behaviour of a two - dimensional disk of 20,000 gas particles and aligning and coadding individual snapshots within @xmath53 0.2 bar rotation periods in 0.1 period increments .",
    "we also assumed that each galaxy has only one pattern speed , that of the bar , and @xmath9 was the main parameter that was varied . with an estimate of @xmath13 and using the lindblad precession frequency curves derived from our potentials , we are able to link @xmath9 to @xmath22 via @xmath12 . in doing so , we varied @xmath9 by allowing @xmath22 to increase from 1.0 by increments of 0.1 .",
    "treuthardt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) investigated the morphological effects of differing the gravitational potential used in the simulations of ngc 1433 .",
    "they found that the different m / l models of bell & de jong ( 2001 ) had little effect on the modeled morphology of the galaxy .",
    "the amplitude of the bar potential was also incrementally altered in order to account for possible uncertainties in the bar height or halo contribution .",
    "the morphology of the resultant models were markedly different from each other in terms of inner ring shape and outer spiral morphology ( see figure 9 of treuthardt et al .",
    "this implies that the use of grossly inaccurate gravitational potentials will not produce models with morphologies that can be easily matched to observations .",
    "further examples of morphological variation within sticky particle models of a galaxy can be found in treuthardt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the best fitting @xmath22 of each galaxy was determined by visually comparing the observed @xmath24-band morphology to that produced in a series of models .",
    "deep @xmath24-band images with good resolution are ideal for comparing observed low velocity dispersion , young stellar components , such as resonance rings , to our models . in our simulations ,",
    "the viscosity within various regions of the gas particle system may not be comparable to real systems , meaning features seen in the simulation snapshots can correspond to different physical timescales in different regions . with that in mind",
    ", we primarily compared the morphology in the region near the ends of the bar ( such as the size and shape of any inner rings ) but also considered the outer spiral structure , especially any outer ring features . since we are dealing with gas particle simulations of barred spiral galaxies , areas within the bar region of our models tend to be void of gas particles and are not considered in matching with the observed images .",
    "four independent estimates of the model morphology that best matches the observed morphology were used to determine the weighted average value and 1@xmath5 error of @xmath22 given in table 1 . in some cases",
    "a slower @xmath9 provided a better fit to the outer spiral structure while a faster @xmath9 provided a better fit to the inner structure .",
    "this is not unexpected since n - body simulations have shown that the spiral component may have a slower pattern speed then that of the bar ( e.g. rautiainen & salo 1999 )",

    "<S> the discovery of a relationship between supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and spiral arm pitch angle ( @xmath0 ) is evidence that smbhs are tied to the overall secular evolution of a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of smbhs in late - type galaxies with little or no bulge suggests that an underlying correlation between the dark matter halo concentration and smbh mass ( @xmath1 ) exists , rather than between the bulge mass and @xmath1 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath0 using a two - dimensional fast fourier transform and estimate the bar pattern speeds of 40 barred spiral galaxies from the carnegie - irvine galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern speeds were derived by estimating the gravitational potentials of our galaxies from @xmath2-band images and using them to produce dynamical simulation models . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern speeds allow us to identify those galaxies with low central dark halo densities , or fast rotating bars , while @xmath0 provides an estimate of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a wide range of @xmath1 exists in galaxies with low central dark matter halo densities , which appears to support other theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that galaxies with low central dark halo densities appear to follow more predictable trends in @xmath0 versus de vaucouleurs morphological type ( @xmath3 ) and bar strength versus @xmath3 than barred galaxies in general . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical relationship between @xmath1 and total gravitational mass of a galaxy ( @xmath4 ) allows us to predict the minimum @xmath4 that will be observationally measured of our fast bar galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions will be investigated in a subsequent paper .    </S>",
