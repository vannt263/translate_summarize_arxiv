    "bohr s principle of complementarity  @xcite is a cornerstone of the modern understanding of the physical world at the quantum level .",
    "it states that a quantum system may exhibit equally real yet mutually exclusive properties  it requires seperate experiments to examine different features of a system .",
    "certain properties can not be measured simultaneously even though both measurements are individually possible and are in fact necessary for a full description of the object .",
    "this principle forms the foundation of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and states that a quantum object , such as an electron , does not have an objective reality ; instead all descriptions of properties of such an object must be given in terms of experiments made on the object .",
    "we do not ` reveal ' the value of properties in experiments but rather assign them by the act of measurement .",
    "the original _ orthodox _ complementarity principle of bohr states that wave and particle attributes may not be simultaneously displayed by a quantum system .",
    "this stringent stipulation was later relaxed to permit the observation of complementary observables within the same experimental set up , although retaining a restriction on the degree to which each could be observed in the same experiment .",
    "wooters and zurek  @xcite were the first to consider an interferometric setting where particle - like _ welcher weg _ information was obtained whilst preserving the wave - like interference pattern , although an increase in the precision with which one of the two behaviors is observed results in a corresponding decrease in the precision of the other .",
    "a similar observation concerning neutron interferometry was made by greenberger and yasin a decade later  @xcite .",
    "a quantative theoretical basis for this effect has been given independently by jaeger _",
    "et al _  @xcite and englert  @xcite .",
    "more recently , jakob and bergou  @xcite derived a generalised complementarity relation for pure bipartite systems of two qubits involving local properties ( that describe the single - partite nature of the system ) and a measure of the non - local properties that describe its bipartite nature .",
    "a proposal for a quantum - non - demolition test of bipartite complementarity relations has been put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we study bipartite complementarity in a continuous variable ( cv ) system by taking the infinite - dimensional limit of the relation designed in  @xcite for @xmath0-level systems .",
    "our aims are firm on a pragmatic ground : we are interested in verifying quantum complementarity between single - partite and multi - partite properties of a two - mode cv system and in identifying a clear connection with experimentally - accessible quantities characterizing the state at hand .",
    "we achieve this result by using the powerful tool of variance - matrix formalism of two - mode gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "this class encompasses cv states whose characteristic function is gaussian in the phase space and includes many relevant experimentally available cv states .",
    "we show that for two - mode states with specific chracteristics of symmetry , any entry in the bipartite complementarity relation can be expressed in terms of the elements of the variance matrix of the system and , as such , can be fully experimentally determined by means of homodyne measurements , for instance  @xcite .",

    "the first two quantities give a measure of single - particle behavior in that they account for single - particle coherence and welcher - weg information ( _ i.e. _ single - particle relative population ) , respectively . on the other hand , concurrence accounts for genuine bipartite properties of the state under scrutiny . with these definitions",

    "it is appropriate to think about a collective single - particle quantity , defined as @xmath16 , which is globally invariant under local unitary operations .",
    "we may then express the complementarity relation as a more traditional `` duality '' formula @xmath17 it is worth stressing , on the other hand , that a grouping process putting together concurrence and predictability , so as to form a new entity called _ distinguishability _ , allows us to put bipartite complementarity relations of the form reported here in correspondence with englert s complemetarity relation  @xcite , which is only apparently a single - partite relation  @xcite .",
    "key to the aims of our work is the observation that eq .",

    "any property ( such as purity and entanglement ) of the state can be expressed by relying on the elements of the associated vm , which is characterized by important properties of invariance with respect to symplectic operations .",

    "we have discussed the relation between the vm of a bipartite cv state and a complementarity relation that contrasts local and non - local properties . we have revealed that symmetry in the vm allows the formulation of a simple connection between quadrature variances and predictability / entanglement .",
