    "a basic approach is to generalize the explicit construction of linking cycles done by bott and samelson . pursuing this strategy",
    ", we need and find global structural characteristics of the foliations concerned .",
    "while singular riemannian foliations are well understood locally , their global structure can be arbitrarily complicated at least in the non compact case .",
    "after a short introduction , we restrict our interest to properly embedded leaves from chapter [ s : ex ] forward . at first",
    ", we show the existence of global tubular neighborhoods , see theorem [ theotube ] , which is the basic tool to reveal global structural results in the following .",
    "then , we have a look at exceptional leaves , i.e. leaves of highest dimension with non - trivial holonomy .",
    "this kind of leaves does not occur too often as the set of specificly regular leaves is open , connected and dense in the manifold ( propositions [ propregdense ] and [ propregcon ] ) .",
    "we define the type of a leaf and show that the stratum of exceptional leaves as well as the manifold itself are stratified by the types of leaves .    in the third chapter ,",
    "we analyse foliations without horizontally conjugate points ( with properly embedded leaves ) .",
    "locally constructed variations of horizontal geodesics can be extended globally , which leads to the geometric characterization formulated in theorem [ theowhcp ] : a singular riemannian foliation has no horizontally conjugate points if and only if the singular points are exactly the focal points of the leaves . for this theorem , we need the extension of homothetical transformations , defined in @xcite within tubular neighborhoods , to the negatives which is done in proposition [ prophomotheties ] .",
    "even more , we show that the homothetical transformations are diffeomorphisms that respect not only the leaves but also the types of leaves .",
    "there are two other papers that among other things show the existence of negative homotheties , namely the one of alexandrino and tben , @xcite , and the one of lytchak and thorbergsson , @xcite .",
    "as these proofs are contemporaneous but independent and use completely different methods , we include our proof here .    with these structural results",
    "we finally can address ourselves to morse theory of the leaves , i.e. the tautness problem . as a first step ,",
    "we show that the leaves of a singular riemannian foliation without horizontally conjugate points are @xmath0-taut .",
