    "the growing faith in the late time cosmic acceleration is directly supported by observations of high red - shift supernovae and indirectly by observations on microwave background , large scale structure and weak lensing .",
    "what causes the repulsive effect , in the cosmic expansion , is one of mysteries of modern cosmology at present .",
    "theoretically , the phenomenon can be accounted for either by supplementing the energy momentum tensor by an exotic matter component with large negative pressure ( _ dark energy_)@xcite or by modifying gravity itself .",
    "cosmological constant , the simplest candidate of dark energy , is plagued with fine tuning problem of an unacceptable level@xcite .",
    "scalar field could provide an interesting alternative to cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "they can mimic cosmological constant like behavior at late times and can give rise to a viable cosmological dynamics at early epochs .",
    "scalar field models with generic features are capable of alleviating the fine tuning and coincidence problems@xcite . as for the observations , at present , they are absolutely consistent with @xmath1 but at the same time , a large number of scalar field models are also permitted .",
    "future data should allow to narrow down the class of permissible models of dark energy .",
    "as an alternative to dark energy , the large scale modifications of gravity could account for the current acceleration of universe .",
    "we know that gravity is modified at short distance and there is no guarantee that it would not suffer any correction at large scales where it is never verified directly .",
    "large scale modifications might arise from extra dimensional effects or can be inspired by fundamental theories of high energy physics . on purely phenomenological grounds ,",
    "one could seek a modification of einstein gravity by replacing the ricci scalar in einstein - hilbert action by @xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , any large scale modification of gravity should reconcile with local gravity constraints and should have potential of being distinguished from cosmological constant . since the general theory of relativity is in excellent agreement with local gravity phenomenon , it is quite challenging to construct a viable model of @xmath0 gravity along the said lines .",
    "stability requires that the first and the second derivatives of @xmath0 with respect to the ricci scalar @xmath2 should be positive definite .",
    "most of the corresponding modifications of the einstein - hilbert action are either cosmologically un - viable or can not be distinguished for the cosmological constant .",
    "the class of models proposed by hu - sawicki and starobinsky ( hss ) is of great interest .",
    "these models can evade local gravity constraints and have potential capability of being distinguished from the cosmological constant@xcite(see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , they are quite delicate @xmath3 the minimum of the scalaron ( scalar degree of freedom present in @xmath0 gravity ) potential which corresponds to dark energy in these models is very near to field configuration corresponding to infinitely large value of @xmath2 for solar physics constraints to evaded .",
    "thus it is quite likely that the scalar field , which controls the space - time curvature , hits singularity while evolving near the de - sitter minimum@xcite .",
    "the problem becomes acute in high curvature regime but can be circumvented by carefully tuning the parameters of the model@xcite .",
    "the hss models are characterized by a finite potential barrier between the minimum of the scalaron potential and the curvature singularity and hence are vulnerable to singularity .",
    "recently , the hss models were modified such that the said potential barrier is infinite and the curvature singularity is hidden behind the infinite potential barrier@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the deformations of hss models and demonstrate that these models are generic to local gravity constraints .",
    "we also argue that the viable resolution of curvature singularity can be provided by adding higher curvature terms to the originally proposed form of @xmath0 in refs.@xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath0 gravity in jordan frame in the presence of matter described by the matter lagrangian @xmath4 is given by @xcite , @xmath5 , \\label{actionj}\\ ] ] where the matter lagrangian depends on the metric @xmath6 and the matter fields .",
    "in what follows , it would be convenient to write @xmath0 in the following form , @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the correction to einstein - hilber action and @xmath9 denotes its derivative with respect to the ricci scalar @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 theory apart from the spin-2 object necessarily contains a scalar degree of freedom which becomes clear either by taking the trace of the modified einstein equations obtained from ( [ actionj ] ) or by passing to the einstein frame .",
    "indeed one can always make a conformal transformation which converts the original action ( [ actionj ] ) into einstein - hilbert action along with a canonical scalar field @xmath10 which directly couples to matter .",
    "the solar system and equivalence principle bounds give a strong constraint on the magnitude of the scalar field @xmath10 in the einstein frame .",
    "the potential of field @xmath10 is uniquely constructed from the ricci scalar @xmath2 .",

    "it is really interesting that the height of the barrier between de - sitter minimum and curvature singularity turns out to be proportional to @xmath91 which is heavily constrained by local gravity constraints . in what follows",
    ", we shall address this issue .",
    "let us note that in the limit of @xmath95 , @xmath96 and the maximum of the potential is located at @xmath97 whose magnitude is given by @xmath98 since @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we find that @xmath101 .",
    "the minimum of the potential in free space given by ( [ maxv ] ) can be estimated numerically , @xmath102 at @xmath103 . in this case",
    "the height of the potential barrier for large value of @xmath91 is approximately equal to @xmath104 as shown in the fig.[pott ] .",
    "the local gravity constraints impose a restriction on the height of the barrier or equivalently , the parameter @xmath91 for a given value of @xmath69 and @xmath105 . in case of @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ,",
    "the model passes both the local gravity constraints . for large values of @xmath91 ,",
    "the height of the potential barrier becomes large thereby hiding the singularity but resulting into clear violation of local gravity constraints .",
    "we also observe that taking small values of @xmath91 , the de - sitter minimum shifts towards singularity , see fig.[pott ] .",
    "this implies that we should have moderate values of parameters for a viable evolution .",
    "situation gets worse when we move to high density regime whose treatment requires extreme fine tuning of initial conditions of the field@xcite .    as we have seen that the size of @xmath109 for any viable @xmath0 gravity and is constrained to be less than @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the minimum of the potential corresponding to @xmath111 , is very close to @xmath112 even in the case of baryonic / dark matter density .",
    "it should be emphasized that in case of large curvature , the quantum effects become important leading to higher curvature corrections . keeping this in mind",
    ", we can incorporate @xmath113 term in the model under consideration@xcite(see ref.@xcite on the similar theme ) which allows us to move the singularity away from @xmath97 .",
    "the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint at @xmath114 mev ( @xmath115 or @xmath116 tells us that the correction term should satisfy the following condition@xcite , @xmath117 if we choose @xmath118 , we find that @xmath119 . in case of neutron star with @xmath120 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath121 is constrained to be @xmath122 .",
    "the local gravity constraints are satisfied in this case as @xmath123 let us note that in case we intend to describe inflation with the help of @xmath124 terms @xmath3 _ a la _ starobinsky model , the numerical value of @xmath121 is much smaller than the quoted value . indeed",
    ", the mass of scalaron ( @xmath125 ) , if it is to be inflaton , should be @xmath126@xcite which implies that @xmath121 is much smaller than its numerical value quoted in case of neutron star .",
    "such a correction does not disturb the neutron star physics and nucleosynthesis constraint but can help in avoiding the curvature singularity . as a result , the correction term can not contribute any effect to the local gravity experiments .",
    "this implies that the behavior of the model improves in the high curvature regime though it might be quite challenging to probe it numerically .",
    "plane for the hss model ( @xmath127 ) with the additional term @xmath128 .",
    "the dashed diagonal line is the critical line @xmath129 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath66 is chosen such that the condition of the stability of the future de sitter stage is satisfied.,width=415 ]    we can see from fig.([mr ] ) that in case the bbn condition on @xmath121 is satisfied , the model would have a standard matter phase .",
    "then a small @xmath121 is not only necessary for the bbn but also for the matter phase .",
    "furthermore because of this additional term the curve @xmath130 cross the line @xmath131 for a finite @xmath2 while @xmath132 for the hss model .",
    "thus we can connect the early phase of accelerated expansion to the late time acceleration of universe without a singularity of the curvature scalar @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have examined the variants of hss models described by three parameters , @xmath66 , @xmath91 and @xmath69@xcite .",
    "the hss scenario in starobinsky parametrization corresponds to @xmath106 and @xmath133 .",
    "these models can satisfy the local gravity constraints and have potential capability of being distinguished from cosmological constant .",
    "the de - sitter minimum of the effective potential of the scalar degree of freedom is quite close to curvature singularity for moderate values of @xmath66 and @xmath91 in these models . for larger values of @xmath66 and @xmath134 , the de - sitter minimum moves towards singularity .",
    "the potential barrier between the de - sitter minimum and curvature singularity is finite in hss models which makes them delicate .",
    "thus one should carefully tune the scalaron evolution such that it does not hit singularity while evolving in the neighborhood of the minimum of effective potential . for a given value of @xmath69",
    ", the height of the barrier is defined by the parameter @xmath91 which is large for larger values of @xmath91 thereby hiding the singularity behind the potential barrier@xcite .",
    "however , large potential barrier between singularity and de - sitter minimum comes into conflict with the local gravity constraints .",
    "the high curvature behavior of @xmath135 is extremely crucial for local gravity constraints to be evaded . in case @xmath136",
    "slowly as it happens in case of large @xmath91 , we can not satisfy the local gravity constraints . on the contrary , if @xmath135 approaches zero fast , the corresponding models become more vulnerable to singularity as the minimum of the effective potential moves very near to singularity in the high curvature regime . in this case",
    ", the models under consideration can hardly be distinguished from cosmological constant .",
    "the hss scenario is build very carefully such that the curvature dependence of @xmath137 is just right to satisfy the local gravity constraints and at the same time to allow to distinguish itself from @xmath78 .",
    "thus the finite time singularity in viable @xmath0 models is generic .",
    "however , the safe passage of the scalaron to the minimum of its effective potential can be ensured by the appropriate fine tuning of the scalaron evolution@xcite .",
    "the fine tuning turns ugly in case of compact objects like neutron stars .",
    "the introduction of higher curvature terms becomes legitimate near singularity and can in principle improve the behavior of the model .",
    "the resulting scenario can give rise to a viable cosmic evolution .",
