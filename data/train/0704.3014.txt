    "the act of pumping is well known from everyday life . by repeatedly operating a periodic sequence of steps one can transfer a certain amount of fluid or gas between reservoirs held at equal potential .",
    "the same principle applies to electrical charge . by periodically modulating spatially - confined potentials it is possible to generate a nonzero dc current between leads that are kept at equal temperature and electrochemical potential . when operated sufficiently slow such that the typical scattering time for electrons is much faster than the time over which the scattering potentials vary , this process is know as adiabatic quantum pumping .",
    "recently , there has been considerable theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite interest in adiabatic quantum pumping in confined nanostructures . besides the fundamental and technological importance of understanding time - dependent phenomena in nano - devices such as semiconductor and carbon nanotube quantum dots ,",
    "adiabatic quantum pumping offers new possibilities that otherwise are difficult to realize in conventional dc transport measurements with a finite voltage bias .",
    "most notably , the ability to pump a quantized amount of charge per cycle ,  @xcite which is of potential metrological importance . in this paper",
    "we address another such example , the generation of pure , possibly quantized spin current without any charge current .",
    "@xcite    in the absence of interactions , adiabatic pumping is by now well understood .",
    "in particular , building on the scattering approach of bttiker _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite brouwer has elegantly shown  @xcite that the adiabatically pumped current can be expressed in terms of the instantaneous ( equilibrium ) scattering matrix . in the case of two driven parameters ,",
    "the pumped charge per cycle reduces to a geometrical property of the equilibrium scattering matrix , pertaining to the area enclosed in parameter space by the pumping cycle .",
    "all other details of the pumping cycle , i.e. , the explicit time dependences of the scattering potentials , are irrelevant as long as pumping is adiabatic .",
    "far less understood are the effects of interactions , where efforts have focused thus far on zero-  @xcite and one - dimensional  @xcite systems .",
    "the difficulty with incorporating interactions lies in the need to treat retardation effects beyond the static limit .",
    "indeed , recent attempts to generalize brouwer s formula so as to include interactions  @xcite have either required the introduction of complicated vertex corrections ,  @xcite or the application of a gradient expansion to interaction - induced self - energies .",
    "@xcite both formulations can only be implemented approximately at this stage , urging the need for benchmark results against which approximate treatments can be tested . in this paper",
    "we provide such an exact result for the pumped currents through a kondo impurity .",
    "kondo - assisted tunneling has been observed by now in an abundance of nanostructures , ranging from semiconductor  @xcite and nanotube  @xcite quantum dots , to single - atom  @xcite and single - molecule  @xcite transistors . in the kondo regime , these systems are described by the well - known kondo model : a spin-@xmath2 local moment undergoing antiferromagnetic spin - exchange with the conduction electrons in the leads .",
    "the nonequilibrium kondo model , either with a static or a time - dependent voltage bias , is a difficult problem .",
    "remarkably , it possesses an exact solution when tuned to a special manifold in its parameter space , known as the toulouse limit .",
    "@xcite at the toulouse limit one can apply a suitable canonical transformation to recast the interacting problem in free , quadratic form .",
    "this requires the introduction of new fermionic degrees of freedom having no simple relation to the physical electrons in the leads .",
    "the resulting solution , which generalizes previous exact results for the equilibrium kondo problem ,  @xcite does not correspond to realistic parameters .",
    "it requires large values of certain exchange couplings ( see below ) , rendering it incapable of describing weak - coupling physics .",
    "however , the toulouse limit is expected to correctly describe the strong - coupling regime of the nonequilibrium kondo effect , as different microscopic models are governed by the same strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "indeed , previous applications of the model to dc ,  @xcite ac ,  @xcite and pulsed - bias potentials  @xcite have shown all the qualitative features of kondo - assisted tunneling : a zero - bias anomaly that splits in an applied magnetic field ; fermi - liquid characteristics in the low-@xmath3 and low-@xmath4 differential conductance ; side peaks in the differential conductance at @xmath5 for an ac drive of frequency @xmath6 ; and a hierarchy of time scales for the rise , saturation and falloff of the current in response to a pulsed bias potential .",
    "the toulouse limit was also recently applied to compute the full counting statistics for tunneling through a kondo impurity .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we take the solution one step further , by exactly computing the adiabatically pumped currents on the toulouse manifold .",
    "contrary to previous applications of the toulouse limit to kondo - assisted tunneling we set the voltage bias to zero , but consider a general periodic modulation of the transverse exchange couplings and the local magnetic field ( the free parameters on the toulouse manifold ) . in the limit of slow time variations",
    "we obtain an exact analytic expression for the adiabatically pumped spin current . in particular , we show that a nonzero spin current can be pumped through the system for a time - varying magnetic field , provided the couplings to the two leads are made asymmetric .",
    "such a condition is easily met in practical devices .",
    "unlike the spin current , the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero in the absence of both potential scattering and a voltage bias , as follows from general symmetry considerations .",
    "this feature is generic to the kondo model , independent of the adiabatic and toulouse limits .",
    "hence tunneling through a kondo impurity offers a natural mechanism for the realization of a spin battery , i.e. , a source of pure spin current without any charge current .",
    "this statement , valid both in the adiabatic limit and beyond , is in qualitative agreement with earlier slave - boson mean - field studies of adiabatic pumping through an anderson impurity ,  @xcite indicating that no fine tuning of model parameters is required as long as one operates in the kondo regime .",
    "finally , we show that one can devise suitable pumping cycles that operate as a quantized spin pump .",
    "namely , a spin closely quantized to @xmath1 is pumped per cycle without an accompanying charge .",
    "as indicated above , the solution at the toulouse limit relies on a nonlocal transformation that converts the original spin - exchange hamiltonian to free - fermion form .",
    "@xcite in contrast to conventional quadratic hamiltonians , though , the number of fermions ( not to be confused with the physical electrons in the system ) is not conserved , excluding the application of brouwer s formula in its existing form . to generalize brouwer s result to this somewhat unconventional case",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in studying the photovoltaic effect in open chaotic cavities .",
    "starting from the nonequilibrium keldysh green function technique , we show how the adiabatic limit is obtained from a systematic gradient expansion . in this manner",
    "we are able to express the instantaneous spin current in terms of an energy - shift matrix ,  @xcite leading to a brouwer - type formula for the adiabatically pumped spin current .",
    "the formalism outlined above has three notable advantages over the scattering approach  @xcite originally used by brouwer to derive his result : ( i ) it conveniently accommodates the case where particles are not conserved ; ( ii ) all orders of perturbation theory are summed up in the keldysh technique , thus exceeding linear response ; ( iii ) based on a systematic gradient expansion , one can easily read off the small parameter controlling the adiabatic limit .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the resulting brouwer - type formula for the electronic spin current is formally expressed in terms of the scattering matrix for the majorana fermions that appear in the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "while technically useful , these degrees of freedom have neither a simple representation nor interpretation in terms of the physical electrons in the leads , thus obscuring a clear physical picture .",
    "it remains to be seen whether a similar expression can be written down for the spin current directly in terms of the scattering properties of the lead electrons which carry the current .",

    "a spin-@xmath2 local moment @xmath7 is embedded between two leads of noninteracting spin-@xmath2 electrons , undergoing a spin - exchange interaction with the local conduction - electron degrees of freedom on either side of the junction .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , the impurity moment @xmath7 can either represent an ultrasmall quantum dot with a single unpaired electron ,  @xcite or an actual magnetic impurity as in single - atom  @xcite and single - molecule  @xcite transistors .",
    "since scattering off the impurity is restricted to the @xmath8-wave channel , one can reduce the conduction - electron degrees of freedom that couple to the impurity to one - dimensional fields @xmath9 , where @xmath10 labels the lead ( right or left ) and @xmath11 specifies the spin orientations . in terms of the one - dimensional fields , coupling to the impurity takes place via the local spin densities at the origin : @xmath12 .",

    "the transverse couplings @xmath30 and the local magnetic field @xmath22 are allowed to be arbitrary , and will subsequently be taken to be periodically modulated in time .",
    "physically , this choice of parameters implies that tunneling is always accompanied by a spin flip .",
    "although quite remote from the situation encountered in real quantum dots , this model is expected to correctly describe the strong - coupling regime of the kondo effect , as argued in the introduction and elaborated on in refs .   and .",

    "the mapping involves a sequence of steps , comprised of ( i ) bosonizing the fermion fields , ( ii ) a nonlocal canonical transformation involving the conduction - electron spin degrees of freedom , and ( iii ) refermionization of the boson fields to form four new fermion fields : @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",

    "the domain of integration , @xmath232 , is the ( oriented ) area in parameter space enclosed by the contour @xmath225 .",

    "thus , the physical picture underlying eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) is consistent with that of simple resonant elastic scattering , where a single resonance is symmetrically split about the fermi energy by an applied magnetic field .    from a theoretical standpoint it is clear that one can realize a quantized spin pump using either a quantum dot in the kondo regime or a zeeman - split single - particle resonance that is tuned to the fermi energy .",
    "however , practical considerations make the kondo - dot scenario a more promising candidate for the realization of such a device .",
    "indeed , modulation of the couplings to the two leads is typically accompanied in real devices by a capacitive shift of the dot level . in case of a simple resonance ,",
    "the induced modulation of the dot level will generally produce a finite charge current , and is likely to spoil the quantization of the pumped spin .",
    "the kondo - dot scenario is immune to such fluctuations , as these produce only a tiny shift of the abrikosov - shul resonance . indeed , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetries ] , charge transport is strictly forbidden as long as the coulomb - blockaded dot can be described in terms of a pure kondo hamiltonian having no potential scattering .",
    "although a realistic description of quantum dots generally requires the inclusion of potential scattering , the latter term can be made negligibly small by operating the device deep in the kondo regime . in this manner charge transport",
    "can be excluded .",
    "in this paper we have presented an exact analysis of adiabatic quantum pumping through a quantum dot in the kondo regime .",
    "it follows from general symmetry arguments that the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero in the absence of potential scattering and for zero voltage bias .",
    "a similar statement applies to the symmetrized spin current either in the absence of an applied magnetic field or for symmetric coupling to the leads .",
    "pumping of a spin current therefore requires both a finite magnetic field and for left - right symmetry to be simultaneously broken .",
    "both conditions are readily met in practical devices , making ultrasmall quantum dots a natural candidate for the realization of a spin battery .    to quantify this statement ,",
    "we have computed the pumped spin current exactly at the toulouse limit . exploiting the mapping onto a quadratic hamiltonian and performing a controlled expansion in the small parameter @xmath289 ( @xmath190 being the characteristic modulation frequency , @xmath236 is the kondo temperature ) , we have expressed the pumped spin per cycle as a geometric property of the scattering matrix associated with three flavors of majorana fermions , which are the effective degrees of freedom at the toulouse limit . in particular , employing the coupling to the leads as one pumping parameter and the applied magnetic field as another , we have shown that one can devise pumping cycles that realize a pure quantized spin pump .",
    "namely , a device for which the average spin pumped per cycle is closely equal to @xmath1 , but where no accompanying charge current is produced .",
    "we expect the pumped spin per cycle to remain nearly quantized in real quantum dots provided that one operates at @xmath256 .",
    "there have been by now a number of different proposals in the literature for the realization of spin pumps , employing diverse setups such as chaoticity in quantum dots ,  @xcite ferromagnetic leads ,  @xcite spin - orbit interactions ,  @xcite classical turnstile cycles ,  @xcite one - dimensional luttinger - liquid physics ,  @xcite and finally the kondo effect in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite while all these proposals reported schemes to realize a pure adiabatic spin pump along specific cycles , the quantization of the spin pumped per cycle has been shown to be the case only in the classical turnstile setup  @xcite and for a luttinger liquid .",
    "@xcite in contrast to ref .",
    ", the pumping scheme investigated in this paper offers an interesting possibility to realize a _ coherent _ quantized spin pump , in which the absence of charge current is essentially warranted along all possible cycles ( including beyond the adiabatic limit ) .",
    "the quantization of the pumped spin per cycle reported in this paper is subject to small deviations as the temperature @xmath3 becomes of order @xmath236 , or as the magnetic - field excursion is altered .",
    "moreover , it applies only to the _ average _ spin pumped per cycle . in order to better characterize such a quantum pump , a detailed study of its noise properties ( and full counting statistics )",
    "is desirable .",
    "a study of the statistical properties of the kondo pump is a challenge left for future work .",
