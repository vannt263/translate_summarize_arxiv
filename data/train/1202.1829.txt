    "however , spatial separation of this scale can also be explained by differential dust obscuration in a single galaxy , as has been proposed for other high - redshift smgs where spatial offsets have been observed between rest - frame uv and submillimeter ( e.g. , gn20 and aztec  3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "differential magnification may affect the observed far - ir sed as well as the co ladder , as hotter dust and higher-@xmath42 co lines may have more compact morphologies @xcite .",
    "however , because the magnification map is smooth in the area , the six times difference in the sizes of the co(1@xmath60 ) and the dust emitting region only lead to a @xmath310% difference in magnification , which is smaller than the 1@xmath46 errors of our estimates of the magnification factors .",
    "therefore , differential magnification is unlikely to be significant enough to affect the far - ir sed and future co ladder measurements in hatlas12@xmath100 .",
    "how does the massive gaseous disk compare with the disks in other smgs ?",
    "we estimate an dynamical mass of @xmath265\\times10^{11}$]@xmath12  and a gas fraction of @xmath308% for the co(1@xmath60 ) disk using the `` isotropic virial estimator '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the co line fwhm in km s@xmath13  and @xmath311 is half of the fwhm size of the disk in kpc . combined with the fwhm disk radius , we further estimate a gas surface density of @xmath312  @xmath12  pc@xmath313 .",
    "both @xmath314 and @xmath315 are similar to those of the extended co(1@xmath60 ) disks in the two @xmath316 smgs in @xcite . but both values are significantly smaller than those of the kinematically resolved co(6@xmath65 ) disk of the `` cosmic eyelash '' ( @xmath317 , @xmath318@xmath12pc@xmath313 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the discrepancies illustrate the limitations of these widely used but crude estimators _ and/or _ that high excitation co lines probe more compact and denser regions in a disk .",
    "higher resolution observations are clearly needed to resolve this issue .",
    "without spatially resolved gas kinematics , we refrain from estimating the disk stability parameter of @xcite .    hatlas12@xmath100  is a gas - rich , initial starburst system similar to unlensed smgs and local ulirgs .",
    "its intrinsic ir luminosity well exceeds @xmath319",
    "@xmath10  ( i.e. , hy - lirg ) , implying an enormous rate of star formation ( @xmath251 @xmath12  yr@xmath13 ) .",
    "although the molecular gas reservoir is massive and it constitutes @xmath267% of the _",
    "visible _ baryonic mass ( @xmath320 ) and @xmath269% of the dynamical mass , it will exhaust in just @xmath321  myr at the current sfr ( assuming no gas accretion ) .",
    "the star formation timescale , @xmath322/sfr = @xmath323 myr , is only @xmath31% of the cosmic age at @xmath279 ( @xmath324  gyr ) , suggesting that hatlas12@xmath100  is an initial starburst system with maturity @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "the specific sfr , ssfr = sfr/@xmath225 = @xmath326 gyr@xmath13 , is consistent with the average @xmath17 smgs , but it is an order of magnitude higher than the median value of the star - forming main sequence of lyman break galaxies at the same epoch @xcite . we can also estimate the star formation efficiency : @xmath327 , where @xmath328 is the dynamical or free - fall timescale . for @xmath329 = 3  kpc and @xmath330 , we obtain @xmath331 , or [ 11@xmath3324]% per dynamical timescale , which is comparable to unlensed smgs but is an order of magnitude higher than normal starforming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the dust mass of @xmath244\\times10^{8}$ ]  @xmath12  is similar to the average dust mass of unlensed smgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the gas - to - dust ratio , @xmath333/0.07  m@xmath4  kg@xmath334/0.8 ) , is comparable to that of the milky way . assuming that the dust emission is indicative of the size of the starburst and a starburst disk radius of @xmath335 kpc , the star formation surface density of @xmath336 @xmath234  kpc@xmath313 approaches the eddington limit of radiation pressure supported starburst disks ( @xmath337 @xmath234  kpc@xmath313 ; *",

    "hatlas12@xmath100  is a _ bona fide _",
    "smg with an intrinsic submillimeter flux density of @xmath339  mjy .",
    "the starburst disk , where most of the molecular gas and dust reside , is spatially separated from the less obscured stellar population by @xmath34  kpc , suggesting either a major merger or differentiated dust obscuration .",
    "the @xmath31  kpc radius starburst disk is presumably supported in large by radiation pressure on the dust grains .",
    "its physical properties , such as molecular gas mass , stellar mass , gas - to - dust ratio , gas fraction , sfr , star formation efficiency , and radio - to - far - ir luminosity ratio , are all very similar to unlensed @xmath17 smgs @xcite .",
