    "the open cluster m67 is one of the most comprehensively studied of all star clusters , and has long been the prototype for old ( 4 gyr ) open clusters in the galaxy . indeed ,",
    "one of the first photoelectric color - magnitude diagrams was derived for m67 by johnson &  sandage ( 1955 ) . since that time",
    "the precision of stellar photometry has steadily improved , and with it has the definition of the m67 giant branch ( janes &  smith 1984 , montgomery et al .",
    "1993 ) . indeed",
    "the remarkable narrowness of the m67 giant branch has served as a precise touchstone against which innumerable single - star evolution models have been tested ( e.g. , dinescu et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , even after application of strict proper - motion membership criteria , the color - magnitude diagram of m67 remains littered with stars that do not fall on a single - star isochrone ( fig .",
    "[ s1063:cmd ] ) . some of these seeming anomalies can be accounted for .",
    "for example , one luminous star to the blue of the giant branch is a spectroscopic binary whose composite light can be explained by a giant  main - sequence pairing ; another is a giant  white dwarf pair with a complicated history ( mathieu et al .",
    "1990 , verbunt &  phinney 1995 , landsman et al . 1997 ) .",
    "many of the stars immediately above the turnoff and subgiant branch are spectroscopic binaries and consequently overluminous . and the parallel sequence of stars to the red of the main sequence",
    "is assuredly comprised of binaries as well ( montgomery et al . 1993 ) .",
    "still , there remain stars that are not so easily explained .",
    "most famous are the blue stragglers , first noted in m67 by johnson & sandage .",
    "the origin of blue stragglers in an open cluster environment is still not securely understood today ( bailyn 1995 , hurley et al .",
    "similarly , the yellow giant s1072 , lying 1.2 magnitudes in v above the main - sequence turnoff , has defied explanation . a kinematic member in all three dimensions and lying in projection in the cluster core , its explanation as a non - member remains possible but not satisfying ( mathieu & latham 1986 , nissen et al . 1987 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider two more stars  s1063 and s1113  which by every indication are cluster members , yet whose location in the m67 color - magnitude diagram is dramatically inconsistent with single - star evolutionary theory . specifically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ s1063:cmd ] , these stars lie below the subgiant branch .",
    "our attention has converged on these stars from two directions .",
    "we have underway a multi - decade survey of the spectroscopic binary population in m67 ( mathieu et al .",
    "1990 , latham et al .",
    "both s1063 and s1113 were found to be spectroscopic binaries , with s1113 in particular being notable for the rapid rotation of its primary star .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also undertaken a comprehensive study of stellar x - ray sources in m67 based on rosat observations .",
    "s1063 and s1113 were independently discovered to be x - ray sources , of which there are only 25 known among cluster members .",
    "both stars are also photometric variables ( van den berg et al . 2002 ) , which are infrequent in a cluster of this age ( stassun et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of the orbital , spectroscopic , and photometric properties of s1063 and s1113 . regrettably , like the blue stragglers and s1072 , their interpretation remains a puzzle .",
    "the stars s1063 and s1113 had attracted some attention prior to the radial - velocity and x - ray studies .",
    "both stars are included in the highly precise proper - motion study of girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , in which s1063 is given a proper - motion membership probability of 97% and s1113 of 98% .",
    "being a bit less than one core radius from the cluster center , s1063 has been included in most photometric studies of m67 ; s1113 is located at three core radii , and thus only has been observed in the wider - field photometric surveys .",
    "racine ( 1971 ) noted that s1063 was photometrically unusual in that it lies roughly a magnitude in @xmath3 below the subgiant branch .",
    "s1113 has photometric properties very similar to those of s1063 , but seems to have escaped notice until mentioned by kaluzny &  radczynska ( 1991 ) . in fig .",

    "both stars have been found to be photometric variables .",
    "racine ( 1971 ) noted a large range ( 0.18 mag ) in photometric observations of s1063 , and its variability was subsequently confirmed by other observers ( rajamohan et al .",
    "1988 , kaluzny &  radczynska 1991 ) .",
    "s1113 has a variable star designation ",
    "ag cnc  and kaluzny &  radczynska ( 1991 ) found s1113 to be photometrically variable at the 0.05 mag level . based on the variability ( but not light curves ) of the stars and their location in the color - magnitude diagram , kaluzny &  radczynska ( 1991 ) suggested that both stars are highly evolved w uma binaries with extremely small mass ratios and consequently small photometric amplitudes .",
    "both s1063 and s1113 were included in a large survey for spectroscopic binaries among m67 proper - motion cluster members begun in the mid-1980 s ( last summarized in latham et al .",
    "s1063 was found to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary , with no evident distinction otherwise .",
    "s1113 was immediately recognized as an unusual double - lined spectroscopic binary in that the primary star was a rapid rotator .",
    "independently , rosat pspc observations of m67 identified these two stars as among 25 cluster members detected to have x - ray emission ( belloni et al .",
    "1993 , 1998 ) . as members of this select group ,",
    "s1063 and s1113 received optical spectroscopic attention by pasquini & belloni ( 1998 ) and van den berg et al .",
    "both stars show strong emission cores in the ca ii h and k lines , indicative of chromospherically active stars .",
    "both stars also show h@xmath4 emission . in",
    "s1063 the h@xmath4 line is asymmetric , showing emission which is blue - shifted with respect to an absorption feature .",
    "the position of the absorption line agrees with the velocity of the primary , perhaps suggesting that the absorption can be attributed to the primary star and that the h@xmath4 emission originates elsewhere in the system .",
    "alternatively , the h@xmath4 line profile is very similar to that seen from hklac by catalano &  frasca ( 1994 ) , who attribute the emission to a large flare lasting 6 days .",
    "in s1113 the h@xmath4 emission is broad and clearly centered on the velocity of the primary star , with an equivalent width of 15  .",
    "radial - velocity observations of s1063 were begun in 1987 , and 28 observations were obtained through 1989 .",
    "18 radial - velocity observations were obtained for s1113 between 1989 and 1998 .",
    "all observations were obtained with the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometers ( latham 1992 ) .",
    "two nearly identical instruments were used on the multiple mirror telescope and the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector atop mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona .",
    "echelle spectrographs were used with intensified photon - counting reticon detectors to record about 45   of spectrum in a single order near 5187   with a resolution of 8.3 km s@xmath5 and signal - to - noise ratios ranging from 8 to 15 per resolution element .",
    "the 28 radial velocities for s1063 were measured using the one - dimensional correlation package rvsao ( kurtz &  mink 1998 ) running inside the iraf environment .",
    "the template spectrum was drawn from a new grid of synthetic spectra ( morse &  kurucz , in preparation ) calculated using kurucz s code atlas9 .",
    "we correlated our observed spectra against an array of solar - metallicity templates spanning effective temperature , surface gravity , and projected rotation velocity .",

    "0.2 km s@xmath5 is consistent with the cluster mean radial velocity of 33.5 km s@xmath5 and observed velocity dispersion of 0.5 km s@xmath5 ( mathieu 1983 ) , so the star is a kinematic cluster member in all three dimensions .",
    "otherwise , the orbital elements are unremarkable .",
    "the analyses of the s1113 spectra were done using the two - dimensional correlation technique todcor ( zucker &  mazeh ( 1994 ) , as implemented at cfa ) .",
    "a two - dimensional array of templates in effective temperature and projected rotation velocity , again derived from kurucz spectra , were correlated with all of the s1113 spectra .",

    "we here summarize their main results .",
    "van den berg et al . ( 2002 ; figure 5 ) also find s1063 to be variable , but as yet no period has been identified in the photometric data .",
    "the variability is clearly of a long - term nature .",
    "if it is periodic , the 18-day - long eso light curve establishes that the period is longer than the pseudo - synchronous period of 14.64 days ( hut 1981 , eq.42 ; see also claret & gimnez 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the eso and kitt peak data do not phase up on the orbital period of 18.4 days .",

    "the @xmath18 color shows little or no variation as the system brightens .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 become bluer by as much as 0.05 mag with increased system brightness .",

    "[ s1063:1113phot ] the @xmath3 light curves derived from the 18-day eso observations and phased to the radial - velocity orbit solution , which is also shown in fig .  [ s1063:1113phot ] .",

    "maximum brightness occurs at orbital phase 0.5 , when the stars are aligned perpendicular to our line of sight and the primary is approaching .",
    "the system becomes bluer in all bands as it brightens , although again it is most evident in @xmath20 .",
    "a time - series analysis on all of the photometric data indicates a possible period of 2.822@xmath11 0.001 days .",
    "this period is very similar to the orbital period of 2.823094@xmath110.000014 days , indicating a close association .",
    "there is some indication that the light curve shape is not stable . as is evident in figure 4 , three sets of photometric observations obtained at intervals of 4 - 6 weeks and 2 years",
    "do not repeat to within the formal photometric errors , suggestive that the source of the photometric modulation has undergone small changes on these time scales .",
    "we use kinematic evidence to assess the membership of these binaries in the m67 cluster . as noted above , girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) find the proper - motion membership probability of s1063 to be 97% and of s1113 to be 98% .",
    "the location of s1113 at 3 core radii in projection makes the argument for its membership somewhat less secure .",
    "however , even weighting by the cluster surface - density distribution girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) give it a membership probability of 94% , reflecting the fact that s1113 lies within the half - mass radius of the cluster ( mathieu 1983 ) . at the same time",
    ", both binaries have radial velocities within 1 km s@xmath5 of the cluster radial velocity .    the proper motions of girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) are of very high precision , and thus their ability to distinguish cluster members and field stars is excellent ( see their figure 5 ) .",
    "nonetheless , even the highest probability members have some chance of being field stars .",
    "our radial - velocity survey provides independent information which permits us to evaluate the percentage of field stars among the proper - motion high - probability members .",
    "specifically , we consider the sample of stars with proper - motion membership probability greater than 95% . within this sample",
    "there are 140 stars with multiple radial - velocity measurements obtained in the cfa survey and no indication of velocity variability . of these 140 stars",
    ", only one has a velocity ( 25.6 km s@xmath5 ) indicating non - membership .",
    "the remainder show a gaussian velocity distribution with a mean velocity of 33.55 km s@xmath5 and a velocity dispersion of 1.06 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this result remains true for the subset of 39 stars at projected radii greater than 2 core radii , which show a mean velocity of 33.45 km s@xmath5 and a velocity dispersion of 1.07 km s@xmath5 .",
    "based on the single field - star interloper , we conclude that the field contamination among those high - probability proper - motion members is of order 1% .",
    "a fraction of these field - star contaminants may have radial velocities similar to that of the cluster .",
    "the field radial - velocity dispersion is expected to be much larger than the observed cluster velocity dispersion of 0.5 km s@xmath5 . as",
    "yet the true field radial - velocity distribution in the direction and magnitude range of the proper - motion study has not been measured . in its place we model the field radial - velocity distribution with a gaussian having a typical galactic disk velocity dispersion of 20 km s@xmath5 ( sparke & gallagher 2000 ) and conservatively center the field velocity distribution on the m67 radial velocity . with an r.m.s dispersion of 29 km",
    "s@xmath5 . since the survey selection was based on proper - motion membership , this distribution is not independent of the proper - motion distribution and thus may not be appropriate for use in this analysis .",
    "nonetheless these results give plausibility to the adopted radial - velocity distribution . ] with these assumptions , we find that 4% of field stars have velocities within 1 km s@xmath5 of the cluster velocity , corresponding to two times the observed velocity dispersion of cluster members .",
    "thus we estimate that the percentage of field stars with both high proper - motion membership probability and radial velocities consistent with cluster membership is no more than 0.04% .",
    "there are 246 stars in the proper - motion study with membership probabilities in excess of 95% . using the binomial theorem and our estimated probability of 0.04% ,",
    "there is a 0.4% chance that two of these stars are field stars with radial velocities consistent with cluster membership , and a 9% chance that one such star is a field star .",
    "given that the chances of one or even two field stars being three - dimensional kinematic members of m67 are not entirely negligible , the possibility that s1063 and s1113 are field stars rather than anomalous members must be explored . however , as we shall see in the next section , neither of these systems can be completely explained as field stars . furthermore , s1063 and s1113 are not the only three - dimensional kinematic members of m67 without evident explanation ; for example , s1072 already has been noted in the introduction .",
    "the probability that all of these seemingly anomalous cluster members are simply field stars is indeed negligible .",
    "finally , several of the authors would argue that s1063 and s1113 have been drawn from the much smaller sample of rosat - detected stars , and therefore would conclude that the chances that they are field stars are yet smaller than presented here .",
    "* s1063 * the most notable property of the orbit of s1063 may be its ordinariness .",
    "if s1063 fell on the cluster main sequence or subgiant branch , its orbit would merit no further attention .",
    "for example , the eccentricity of @xmath21 is quite typical for main - sequence and subgiant binaries in m67 with periods @xmath22 days ( mathieu , latham & griffin 1990 ) .",
    "if the primary star is more massive than the unseen secondary , then the orbit places an absolute lower limit on the primary and secondary masses of 0.06 @xmath1 , which is too low to be useful .",
    "given the anomalous location of s1063 in the m67 cmd , we have no estimate of the primary mass based on stellar evolution theory .",
    "however , we will show below that the primary is an evolved star , with the surface gravity of a subgiant .",
    "thus we consider primary masses between 0.7 @xmath1 and 1.3 @xmath1 , delimited by the main - sequence lifetime equal to the age of the galaxy and the upper mass limit on the formation of a subgiant branch .",
    "for this range on the primary mass the orbit places a lower limit on the secondary mass between 0.23 @xmath1 and 0.34 @xmath1 .",
    "evidently the primary star dominates the light at 5187  .",
    "as noted above , the cfa spectra indicate an effective temperature of @xmath23 k and a gravity of @xmath6 .",
    "new analyses of the higher - signal - to - noise spectra of van den berg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) yield similar measures .",
    "comparison of the v i 6251.83  / fe i 6252.57   line ratio with the spectral analyses of gray ( gray 1989 , gray &  johanson 1991 ) yield a @xmath24 of 5150 k for a dwarf and 4900 k for a giant .",
    "alternatively , in fig .  [ s1063:class ]",
    "we use the spectral diagnostic @xmath25 as defined by malyuto &  schmidt - kaler ( 1997 ) to derive a spectral type of g8k0 .",
    "such a spectral classification indicates effective temperatures similar to the spectral line results ( schmidt - kaler 1982 , bessell &  brett 1988 , bessell et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "detailed analyses of the optical spectra obtained by van den berg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) indicate that the primary of s1063 is neither a giant nor a dwarf .",
    "we have taken two approaches to determining the surface gravity .",
    "first , we have compared the gravity - sensitive mg b lines with kurucz spectra . in fig .",
    "[ s1063:magn ] we show the spectrum of s1063 and kurucz spectra at @xmath26 k over a range of @xmath27 . based on the mg b triplet line shapes ,",
    "s1063 is neither a giant ( @xmath28 ) nor a dwarf ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "spectral fitting to the mg i b lines ( with @xmath24 a free parameter ) results in @xmath26 k , @xmath27 = 3.5 , and @xmath8 = 8 km s@xmath5 , corroborating the results obtained from the lower - signal - to - noise cfa spectra .",
    "however , the referee has correctly noted several disparities of relative line depths in other wavelength regions between the observed spectrum and the models , for example comparing the fe i 5187.9 and ti ii / ca i 5188.8 lines .",
    "more detailed spectroscopic analyses and modeling may prove fruitful .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "[ s1063:class ] we compare the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for s1063 with those of stars of all luminosity classes .",
    "again , for stars of similar @xmath25 s1063 falls between the dwarfs and giants .",
    "thus all of the spectroscopic evidence indicates that the primary of s1063 is a subgiant with an effective temperature of @xmath32 k.    montgomery et al .",
    "( 1993 ) provide ubvi photometry ( table  [ s1063:phot ] ) which allows an analysis of the extinction toward s1063 under the assumption that the luminosity of the system derives solely from the primary star .",
    "we initially consider the extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.032 found for m67 by nissen et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . adopting the extinction curve of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the dereddened colors of s1063 are given in table  [ s1063:phot ] .",
    "for comparison we also give in table  [ s1063:phot ] the colors of a solar - metallicity 4-gyr 1.37 @xmath1 subgiant with the same value of ( b - v)@xmath33 , using the yale isochrones with the gdk color transformation ( yi et al .",
    "the intrinsic colors of s1063 are both 0.15 mag bluer in ( u - b ) and 0.14 mag redder in ( v - i ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective temperature implied by the ( b - v)@xmath33 = 1.02 mag is 4577 k , significantly cooler than the effective temperature of 5000 k derived from spectroscopy .",
    "these color differences can be resolved if the extinction toward s1063 ( or equivalently the intrinsic color ( b - v)@xmath33 of s1063 ) is taken as a free parameter .",
    "for example , we consider the colors of a @xmath0 5000 k subgiant , specifically a 4 gyr 1.35 @xmath1 subgiant as defined by the yale models and presented in table  [ s1063:phot ] .",

    "we note that given the observed photometric variability of s1063 ( section 3.2 ) , detailed modeling of colors as in table  [ s1063:phot ] must be considered with care .",
    "s1063 shows little variation in ( b - v ) , and so combined with the spectroscopic derivation of the effective temperature the argument for enhanced extinction toward s1063 remains unchanged .",
    "the argument is also not sensitive to the surface gravity of the primary star , with which the colors vary only slightly . on the other hand , the observed ( u - b ) and",
    "( v - i ) of s1063 show variations of up to 0.05 mag peak - to - peak , and so there is uncertainty in the use of the single - epoch mongtomery et al .",

    "( perhaps surprisingly , the ( u - b ) measurements of mongtomery et al . , racine ( 1971 ) and sanders ( 1989 ) agree to within 0.01 mag ; the ( b - v ) measurements agree to within 0.02 mag . )",

    "interestingly , correcting for a reddening of e ( b - v ) = 0.18 mag moves s1063 to a position 0.15 mag in v below the base of the m67 giant branch .",

    "given a log g = 3.5 this radius implies a mass of 0.7 @xmath1 ; however we have not determined the gravity to better than a factor 2 - 3 .",
    "we stress that all of these values are only meaningful given cluster membership .",
    "alternatively , the colors of s1063 can be modeled with a background giant star having an effective temperature somewhat in excess of 4900 k. for specificity , we show in table  [ s1063:phot ] the intrinsic colors of a 0.8 gyr 2.3 @xmath1 giant , using the yale models with the lcd transformation .",

    "this giant model for the primary also has the modest difficulty of a lower surface gravity ( log g = 2.9 ) compared with the log g = 3.5 derived from the spectral analyses .    in summary",
    ", these color analyses suggest a reddening of s1063 of order 0.15 mag more than can be attributed to galactic extinction in the direction of m67 .",
    "the system might be interpreted as a cluster subgiant or as a distant ( @xmath0 3 kpc ) halo giant , but neither interpretation naturally explains the enhanced reddening .",
    "a conjecture is that the reddening might be due to circumstellar or circumbinary material local to the system .",
    "indeed , the slow but substantial v brightness variation observed in this system might be attributed to variations in local extinction ; however such an explanation is confounded by the lack of associated variation in ( b - v ) .",
    "we also note that the system shows no evidence of a near - infrared excess .",
    "infrared colors have been obtained from the 2mass survey and are given in table 5 .",

    "agree to within the 4% measurement errors on the colors . reducing these errors and extending measurements to longer wavelengths would be worthwhile .    of course , these color analyses presume that the colors of the primary star are not abnormal for a 5000 k star , and that the composite light of the system derives only from the primary photosphere .",
    "we encourage more careful spectroscopic analyses of s1063 , among other things to precisely compare abundances with cluster members , to better determine the surface gravity , and to search for evidence of extincting matter .",
    "we also recommend photometric observations over a broader wavelength range to search for other contributors to the composite light .    finally , we briefly discuss the rotation of the primary star in the context of an m67 1.3 m@xmath37 subgiant with a system e ( b - v ) = 0.18 mag .",
    "the non - detection of the secondary in our spectra requires that the secondary star have @xmath38 , roughly two magnitudes fainter than the primary ( here taken as equivalent to the composite light ) .",
    "if the secondary is a main - sequence star in the cluster , then based on this magnitude limit and extinction the yale isochrones give an upper limit on the mass of the secondary of 0.9 @xmath1 and an associated lower limit on the inclination angle of 28 deg from the orbital solution . for aligned rotational and orbital axes and a measured vsin i of 6 km s@xmath5 , the true equatorial rotation velocity could be as large as 13 km s@xmath5 .",
    "for a primary radius of 2.4 @xmath2 the rotational period could be as short as 9.5 days .",
    "such a short rotation period would be consistent with the observed x - ray emission , chromospheric activity , and possible flares",
    ". perhaps most plausibly the pseudo - synchronous rotation period of 14.64 days ( cf . claret & giminez 1993 ) , requiring an inclination angle of @xmath39 , is permitted by the primary mass range and the upper limit on the secondary mass .",
    "however , we remind the reader that the photometric data show no evidence of periodicity at this rotation period , nor is there strong h@xmath4 emission from the primary ( van den berg et al .",

    "both are expected for a circularized orbit , since alignment and synchronization happen on shorter timescales than circularization ( hut 1981 ) , and synchronization is further supported by the observed photometric variation on a period very similar to the orbital period .    given these two assumptions , the mean density of either star can be written as @xmath40 the mean density is thus independent of the unknown inclination angle and completely determined by the observables msin@xmath41 , p , and vsin i. using the values for these observables and t@xmath42 given in section 3.1 , both stars can be placed on the density - effective temperature diagram , as shown in figure [ fig - rho - temp ] .",

    "similarly , the location of the primary star in figure [ fig - rho - temp ] is closely consistent with the 4 gyr isochrone of m67 , although the uncertainties in effective temperature permit a wide range of ages for the primary star .",

    "the primary lies somewhat further below the subgiant branch and further to the red than indicated by the composite light .",
    "this color deconvolution leaves an interesting loose end , in that the primary shows a ( u - b ) blue excess of 0.3 mag relative to either main - sequence or giant colors .",
    "a giant model selected to match the dereddened primary ( b - v ) color is shown in table  [ s1063:1113decomp ] ; the ( u - b ) color of this model is significantly redder than derived for the primary star .",

    "this excess ultraviolet light may in fact be associated with the primary star , or it may derive from elsewhere in the system .    since the gravity of the primary star is weakly constrained by the spectroscopy , we use both main - sequence and giant models of the same b - v color as the primary to provide bolometric corrections and luminosities at the distance of m67 . the giant model implies a luminosity for the primary of 2.0 @xmath34 and an effective temperature of 4534 k. the main - sequence model provides a luminosity of 2.1 @xmath34 and effective temperature of 4726 k. both of these temperatures are somewhat lower than the spectroscopically determined effective temperature of 4800 k ( section 3.1 ) .    unlike the secondary star",

    "this discrepancy between the primary luminosities derived from geometric and photometric arguments can be cast in a distance - independent manner .",
    "the geometric argument provides a distance - independent prediction for the ratio of primary to secondary v flux . continuing to assume synchronization and alignment of axes , the ratio of primary to secondary radii is the same as the ratio of vsin i. using also the ratio of our spectroscopically determined effective temperatures ( section 3.1 ) ,",

    "this ratio is significantly smaller than the measured flux ratio at v of 0.352 @xmath11 0.016 ( section 3.1 ) .",

    "in addition , the long timescale light variations are not easily explained if they are aperiodic .",
    "if they are periodic on timescales longer than 18 days , then they likely are due to star spots on the primary star and indicate that the primary is not rotating pseudosynchronously .    given both its close kinematic association with m67 and projection upon the core of the cluster",
    ", we have explored explanations for s1063 in the context of cluster membership . in this context , we have previously inferred a radius of 2.4 @xmath2 for the primary star . as such , the primary star does not approach its critical surface at periastron passage .",
    "thus the radius of the star is not confined by the presence of the secondary , nor is there motivation for present mass transfer .",
    "similarly , the eccentricity of the orbit does not suggest either a large evolved star or mass transfer in the past , both of which would likely have circularized the orbit .",
    "we have explored the possibility that rather than being an underluminous subgiant the primary star is instead an overluminous main - sequence star .",
    "for example , a recent merger of two main - sequence stars would deposit kinetic energy into the merging stars .",
    "here we consider two types of mergers : coalescence and collision . in the coalescence scenario ,",
    "the s1063 system was originally a triple system in which the present secondary was the tertiary star .",
    "if we assume that the orbital period that we observe now was equal to the period of the original tertiary star , we can use stability arguments to place an upper limit on the period of the original inner binary star . using the coplanar formulation of mardling &  aarseth ( 1998 ) for the stability of a triple system , and adopting a mass ratio of @xmath49 ( outer star to inner binary ) , we find that an original inner binary would have had an orbital period of less than 2.22 days",
    ". such a period is physically permitted , and so that s1063 was formerly a triple system is possible .",

    "collisions of single stars are improbable .",
    "however , binary - binary encounters have substantially higher probabilities , and in the course of such encounters the probability of a stellar collision is not negligible . in this scenario ,",
    "the present s1063 would consist of three of the stars involved in the binary - binary encounter , two having merged into the primary and a third being the present secondary .",
    "an eccentric orbit is a natural result of such a resonant encounter .",
    "a prediction of either of these merger scenarios is that the resulting star will rotate rapidly . in the coalescence scenario rapid rotation",
    "is expected as a result of synchronous rotation prior to the merger . with respect to the collision scenario , the simulations of sills et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that a collision product is born with a high rotation rate .",
    "we argued in sect .",
    "5 that for aligned rotation and orbital axes , the true equatorial rotation velocity could be as large as 13 km s@xmath5 , and for a primary radius of 2.4 @xmath2 the rotational period could be as short as 10 days . however such a rotation period is still long compared to those expected from mergers or collisions . in the collision scenario , of course , the primary rotation axis and the orbital axis need not be aligned , particularly since tidal circularization has not come to completion . as such , the surface rotation velocity of the primary could be significantly higher .",
    "a high inclination angle could also possibly explain a lack of periodic photometric modulation .",
    "most problematic , these impulsive origins must face the challenge that  even if the merger product would briefly have the properties of the s1063 primary star ",
    "the thermal time scale of the primary is very short compared to the cluster lifetime . if , for the sake of example , we adopt a primary mass of 0.7 @xmath1 , the present thermal time scale @xmath50/@xmath51 is only 3.4 myr .",
    "a merger product would be expected to readjust to its new mass on such time scales ( and perhaps become a present or future blue straggler depending on the combined mass ) .",
    "given such short time scales , the probability of observing the primary prior to its new equilibrium state is very low .",
    "on the other hand , should a star be found shortly after a merger , the presence of residual circumstellar material resulting from the merger might also be expected , and represents a possible explanation for the enhanced reddening of this system .",
    "lastly , if formed recently such a system may not yet be pseudo - synchronized .",
    "we stress that the nature of the secondary is unknown ; we know only that it is substantially fainter than the primary at @xmath3 .",
    "thus the secondary is permitted to be a white dwarf .",
    "an isolated white dwarf of the cluster age would have a mass of order 0.60.7 @xmath1 ( wood 1992 , richer et al . 1998 ) ; a white dwarf deriving from a prior mass transfer scenario could be much different . a hot source of radiation might help explain the weak h@xmath4 emission observed at a velocity different from the primary star velocity .",
    "how the secondary could become a white dwarf without circularizing the orbit during its prior post ",
    "main - sequence evolution would need to be explained ; again , a dynamical exchange might play a role .",
    "* s1113 * in section 5 we derived the properties of the stars in s1113 from two independent lines of reasoning , geometric and photometric .",
    "the two arguments produced quite different conclusions regarding the luminosity ratio of the stars , or similarly regarding the nature of the primary star . to bring these two lines of reasoning into agreement",
    ", we must give up a basic premise of at least one of the arguments . here",
    "we explore two possibilities , and then discuss the measurement uncertainties .",
    "\\a ) both the geometric and photometric arguments converge on a 0.9 @xmath1 main - sequence secondary .",
    "this suggests that the resolution of the contradiction in luminosity ratios might be found in the primary star . under the assumption of membership in m67 the geometric argument",
    "must be found wrong , for its implied 4800 k primary star of radius 4.0 @xmath2 would be 1.2 mag more luminous in v than observed .",
    "the problem can not be solved with extinction , since the reddening vector for the s1113 primary does not pass through an m67 4.0 @xmath2 giant .",
    "examining the premises of the geometric argument , we first note that relaxing the assumption of alignment of orbital and rotational axes can not in itself resolve the problem .",
    "even if the inclination angle of the primary rotation axis is taken to be 90@xmath43 , its radius is reduced only to 3.0 @xmath2 .",
    "( recall that the primary radius derived from the photometric argument is 2.0 @xmath2 . )",
    "supersynchronous rotation of the primary leads to more success .",
    "specifically , a rotation period of 1.4 days - or supersynchronous rotation by a factor of 2 - would bring the primary radii derived from both the geometric and photometric arguments into agreement on a primary radius of 2.0 @xmath2 .",
    "such supersynchronism is not expected theoretically given the close proximity of the stars , the primary s large radius , and the surface convection zones on both stars .",
    "unless continuously driven , the duration of a supersynchronous state would be short .",
    "furthermore , supersynchronous rotation of the primary would also require that the observed variability of the composite light with the orbital period must derive from elsewhere in the system .",
    "a cool spot on the secondary seems an unlikely origin .",
    "given a secondary / primary v luminosity ratio of 0.35 , a 38% light modulation from the secondary would be required to reproduce the observed 10% variation in the composite light at v.    we note that making the secondary subsynchronous would imply a larger , more luminous secondary which would also resolve the flux ratio discrepancy .",
    "however the consequent change in mean density moves the secondary off the main sequence into a domain not occupied by standard stellar evolution ( figure 7 ) . while perhaps this is the case , this path permits essentially unconstrained modeling of the binary .",
    "finally , the unusual cmd position of s1113 is not easily solved by enhanced extinction of a cluster member .",
    "large extinctions ( in excess of 1 mag ) along a standard reddening vector would imply a primary star near the top of the m67 main sequence , with much higher effective temperatures than found spectroscopically .",
    "\\b ) alternatively , we consider arbitrarily discounting the spectroscopically determined flux ratio at v of 0.32 ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) and adopt the geometric model for the system .",
    "this model indicates a secondary / primary flux ratio at v of 0.11 .",
    "corresponding decomposition of the composite v magnitude leads to a primary v = 13.88 and a secondary v = 16.31 .",
    "the geometric model indicates a 0.9 @xmath1 main - sequence secondary , and so without considering additional reddening the secondary v magnitude places the binary 1 mag beyond m67 .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by comparing the luminosity of a 4800 k , 4.0 @xmath2 primary star to the composite light . at this distance",
    "the 1.3 @xmath1 primary becomes very similar to a star at the base of the m67 giant branch , and as such can be explained by standard stellar evolution theory ( albeit not as a cluster member ) .    the larger primary radius of 4.0 @xmath2 implied by the geometric model represents a large fraction of the primary roche radius .",
    "the roche radii are 4.5 @xmath2 and 3.8 @xmath2 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "an equipotential surface about the primary whose volume equals that of a 4.0 @xmath2 sphere extends 74% of the way to the @xmath52 point .",
    "thus , within the geometric model , the role of mass transfer in the evolution of s1113 merits consideration . evidently the 0.9 @xmath2 main - sequence secondary lies well within its roche radius .    interestingly ,",
    "both the phasing of the periodic photometric variation and the ultraviolet excess are suggestive of a hot spot near the secondary star powered by an accretion stream .",
    "such spots are formed on the following side of the secondary ( e.g. , flannery 1975 ) , in qualitative agreement with the phasing of the light and velocity curves shown in figure 4 .",
    "the 10% system brightness variation at v requires a mass accretion rate of 2.5 x 10@xmath53 @xmath1/yr , presuming that the energy is released by a 10,000 k spot on the surface of the secondary star .",
    "we note that at present no spectral signatures of such a hot spot have been seen .",
    "van den berg et al . ( 1999 ) did find broad h@xmath4 from s1113 , but this emission was kinematically associated with the primary star .",
    "they argued that this emission could be consistent with the higher chromospheric activity driven by the rapid rotation of the star , in analogy to v711 tau .",
    "in this context , we note that the photometric variation can also be well modeled by a large cool spot on the primary star .",
    "for example , we have reproduced the light variations with the addition of a cool spot in the upper hemisphere of the primary and located 90@xmath43 from the major axis of the orbit .",
    "specifically the spot properties are : latitude 40@xmath43 , longitude 270@xmath43 , radius 27@xmath43 , temperature 0.82 of the stellar surface temperature .",
    "the location of the spot at 270@xmath43 longitude is motivated by the observations rather than an independent physical argument .    the large extent to which the primary star fills its roche lobe in this model implies that its shape is significantly asymmetric . using the wilson - devinney formalism we have investigated the expected magnitude of photometric variations due to the anticipated ellipsoidal shape of the primary . adopting the spot parameters above , a temperature of 4800 k for the primary star , a limb darkening coefficient ( linear law ) of 0.6 for each star , a gravity - brightening coefficient of 0.32 , and a reflection coefficient of 0.5 , we find the peak - to - peak ellipsoidal variations to be 0.06 mag in @xmath3 .",
    "most importantly , these ellipsoidal variations produce a double - peaked light curve over the orbital period , in marked contrast to the observed single - peaked light curve .",
    "it is possible that these small ellipsoidal variations have gone undetected in contrast to the larger photometric variations of the system .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ s1063:ellips ] we show the light curve combining both the cool spot described above and the ellipsoidal variations .",
    "evidently the ellipsoidal variations are lost to inspection in this synthetic light curve , which in fact looks very similar to the observed light curve .",
    "to summarize , the geometric line of reasoning suggests that s1113 is a field binary located behind m67 . in this scenario",
    "it may be a detached rs cvn whose rapid rotation is producing the several emission diagnostics of enhanced chromospheric activity as well as a large spot .",
    "alternatively , mass transfer may be underway , producing a hot spot in the vicinity of the secondary star .",
    "however , to adopt this interpretation of the system , both the kinematic association with m67 and the agreement of the primary mass with the m67 turnoff mass must be taken as merely coincidental .",
    "in addition , the measured v flux ratio must be ignored . as we discuss below",
    ", we find this last requirement to be a serious counterargument .",
    "\\c ) measurement uncertainties we have explored whether the discrepancy between the conclusions of the geometric and photometric analyses are the result of our measurement uncertainties . on the photometric side , broadband",
    "photometric measurements of s1113 are several and corroborative .",
    "the effective temperature for the primary derived from photometric colors is similar to the effective temperature derived from our high - resolution spectra , indicating that both determinations of the effective temperature are reasonable .",
    "finally , we find it unlikely that the bolometric correction for the primary star overestimates the luminosity by a factor 3 , particularly given the observed excess flux in the u - band .",
    "however , given that only ubv photometry is available , photometry over a wider range of wavelength is much needed .",
    "the geometric luminosity ratio can be brought into accord with the observed v ratio if the effective temperatures and projected rotation velocities of both stars are all adjusted by 1.5 @xmath12 in the appropriate senses .",
    "ad hoc _ and improbable , the required adjustments are small enough relative to their uncertainties that further precise measurements of these quantities are in order .",
    "the measured flux ratio at v is pivotal in this discussion .",
    "external checks of this quantity on other eclipsing binary systems , using similar spectroscopic material and with the same techniques used here , have not shown significant systematic errors . for example , a comparison with independent determinations available from the light - curve solutions of double - lined eclipsing binaries typically agree within 10% or better with our spectroscopic determinations ( see , e.g. , lacy et al .  1997 ; 2000 ) .",
    "thus we have no reason to believe that our flux - ratio measurement for s1113 would be in error by as much as a factor 3 . nonetheless , given the importance of this measurement we encourage additional observational study .    in closing , we note that hurley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have suggested that s1113 is subluminous due to an evolutionary response to mass transfer .",
    "albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) identify stars below the subgiant branch of the globular cluster 47 tuc which they note are similar to s1063 and s1113 .",
    "they suggest that such systems may result from mass transfer , with the subsequent contraction of the primary roche radius deflating the primary star and making it less luminous .",
    "our analyses indicate that , considered as a cluster member ( i.e. , the photometric model ) , both stars in s1113 presently fall well within their roche radii . put another way , if the primary of s1113 fills its roche lobe ( e.g. , the geometric model ) and has an effective temperature of 4800k , the observed brightness places it behind m67 ( and as noted above this conclusion of non - membership can not be removed via extinction arguments ) .",
    "thus at least presently s1113 would not seem to be a candidate for a roche - filling cluster binary .",
    "the stars s1063 and s1113 in the field of the old open cluster m67 have attracted attention for their location in the cluster color - magnitude diagram roughly 1 magnitude below the cluster subgiant branch ( fig .  [ s1063:cmd ] ) .",
    "comprehensive photometric ( optical and x - ray ) , spectroscopic , and astrometric studies have shown them to be rscvn - like systems with observed three - dimensional motions that are the same as that of the cluster to high precision .",
    "their location in the color - magnitude diagram has led us to describe these stars as candidate `` sub - subgiant '' cluster members .",

    "these densities indicate a 0.9 @xmath1 main - sequence secondary star and a 1.3 @xmath1 , 4.0 @xmath2 primary star that very nearly fills its roche lobe . in this model",
    "s1113 would be an rs cvn ( possibly transferring mass ) located behind the cluster .",
    "however , the v flux ratio derived from this model differs by a factor 3 from the spectroscopically measured flux ratio .",
    "in addition , the observed light curve shows no evidence for asymmetry of the nearly - roche - filling primary star .",
    "thus neither the photometric nor the geometric analyses are able to provide a fully consistent model for the s1113 system .    the issue of cluster membership is pivotal for understanding both s1063 and s1113 . given their low apparent luminosity , the interpretation of both binaries as background field rs cvn s is a natural solution .",
    "this interpretation runs counter to the very close kinematic three - dimensional association of both binaries to the cluster .",
    "still , our statistical analyses indicate that the probability of one of the two being a background binary is not entirely negligible , although both being background stars is improbable . equally important",
    ", we have not been able to create model background binaries which reproduce all of the observed properties of either s1063 or s1113 .",
    "star clusters have long been recognized as dynamically active environments , particularly in the form of binary encounters with both single stars and other binaries .",

    "would it be a surprise if the products of such encounters were binary stars . s1063 and",
    "s1113 may be recent products of such encounters , and as such may define alternative evolutionary tracks in the cluster environment .",
    "regrettably we have not yet been able to explain their low luminosities , although we conjecture that their evolutionary histories include mass - transfer episodes , mergers , and/or dynamical stellar exchanges .",
