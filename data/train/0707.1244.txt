    "at low temperatures , low - dimensional electron systems manifest peculiar quantum - transport properties .",
    "one of the key elements of such transport systems are the quantum point contacts ( qpc ) constructed on a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) .",
    "the wide variety of the experiments concerning qpcs  @xcite , including quantum hall effect ( qhe ) based mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi )  @xcite , have attracted many theoreticians to investigate their electrostatic  @xcite and transport properties  @xcite . however , a realistic modelling of qpcs that also takes into account the involved interaction effects is still under debate .",
    "the magneto - transport properties of such narrow constrictions is typically based on the standard 1des  @xcite , which relates the conductance through the structure to its scattering characteristics , considering typically a hard - wall confinement potential .",
    "the reliability of such non - interacting approaches is limited , since interactions are inevitable in many cases and plays a major role in determining the electronic and transport properties . in order to account for the interactions",
    "simplified models are used with some phenomenological parameters , which is not always evident whether such a description is sufficient to reproduce the essential physics .",
    "the qhe based mzi  @xcite has become a central interest to the community , since it provides the possibility to infer interaction mechanisms and dephasing  @xcite between the es by achieving extreme contrast interference oscillations . in these experiments",
    "ess  @xcite are assumed to behave like optical beams , whereas qpcs simulate the semi - transparent mirror in its optical counterpart .",
    "the unexpected behavior of interfering electrons , such as path - length - independent visibility oscillations , is believed to be related to long range @xmath0 interactions .",
    "thus , the experimental findings present a clear demonstration of the breakdown of , commonly used , landauer s conductance picture away from the linear regime . here , we calculate the effective potential in a self - consistent manner and , in addition , using a local version of the ohm s law within and out - of - the - linear - response regime , we obtain the current distribution near the qpc s .",
    "we essentially show that , in the presence of an ies , the imposed current is confined to this region , otherwise is distributed classically .",
    "our aim is to calculate the distribution of the es within a interacting model .",
    "we start with the bare confinement potential obtained from the lithographically defined construction , following ref s  @xcite . for a given pattern of ( metallic )",
    "gates residing on the surface and the potential values @xmath1 , one can obtain the potential experienced @xmath2 by the 2des beneath using semi - analytical scheme  @xcite yielding [ eq : davies]v_ext(*r*,z)= v_g(*r*,0)d*r * , where @xmath3 is the dielectric constant of the hetero - structure ( @xmath4 for gaas / algaas ) and @xmath5 . given the external potential in the position space , it is straight forward to calculate the screened potential in the momentum space @xmath6 by @xmath7 using the thomas - fermi dielectric function , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( for gaas @xmath10 nm ) .",
    "we use this potential to initialize the self - consistent scheme described below , to obtain density @xmath11 and potential distribution in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath12 , at a finite temperature @xmath13 , @xmath14 is scly found . in the absence of an fixed external current @xmath15 , @xmath14 is position independent and is constant all over the sample , which is in turn determined by the average electron ( surface ) number density , @xmath16 . in our calculations we set @xmath17 @xmath18 , corresponding to a fermi energy @xmath19 mev . starting from @xmath20 one can obtain the electron density distribution , within the thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite ( tfa ) , from [ thomas - fermi ] n_el(*r*)=ded(e)f ( [ e+v(*r*)-^]/k_bt ) , where @xmath21 is the gaussian broadened ( single - particle ) density of states ( dos ) and @xmath22^{-1}$ ] the fermi function .",
    "the total potential energy of an electron , @xmath23 , differs from the hartree potential energy @xmath24 by the contribution due to external potentials and is calculated from [ hartree ] v(*r*)=v_ext(*r * ) + _ a d*r * k(*r*,*r*)n_el(*r * ) . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the kernel @xmath25 can be found in a well known text book  @xcite , otherwise has to be solved numerically .    in a classical manner , if a current is driven in @xmath26 direction in the presence of a perpendicular @xmath12 field a hall potential develops in the @xmath27 direction .",
    "therefore the electrochemical potential has to be modified due to external field in the @xmath26 direction with @xmath28 , for a given resistivity tensor and boundary conditions , in the thermal - equilibrium ( locally ) , which brings a new self - consistent loop to our problem .",
    "we calculate the electric field by solving the equation of continuity under static conditions , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , for a fixed total current , self - consistently .",
    "as mentioned above , in the single particle model it is believed that the current is carried by the ballistic 1d landauer - bttiker ( lb)-es and the conductance is obtained by the transmission coefficients .",
    "here we calculate , the electron and current density self - consistently and observe the different distributions of the ies under quantum hall conditions , within the linear response regime .",
    "we will always consider the case , where @xmath31 is larger than the hight of the barrier at the center of the qpc , so that the conductance is finite and it is at least equal to the first landau energy ( @xmath32 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we selected three representative @xmath12 field values , such that ( i ) the system is almost compressible ( a ) ; ( ii ) the ies merge at the opening of the qpc ( b ) and ; ( iii ) the ies percolate through the constraint ( c ) . from the `` classical '' current point of view",
    "we observe that , the current biased from bottom is ( almost ) homogeneously distributed all over the sample if there exists no ies inside the constraint , the current passes through the qpc and ends at the right top contact , mostly ( d ) .",
    "[ fig : fig2]e , shows us that , the current is confined to the ies and conductance is quantized , whereas for @xmath33 it is a bit larger than @xmath34 .",
    "these results indicate that , the ess present structures inside the qpcs if one models them in a more realistic scheme rather than as a single point , although the conductance quantization remains unaffected .",
    "since now we can calculate the widths of the ies , depending on the magnetic field and sample structure it is also possible within this model to obtain the electron velocity inside ies , which may be combined with a recent work by i. neder  @xcite .",
    "this work is based on non - gaussian noise measurements at the mach - zehnder interference experiments .",
    "their main finding is that the unexpected visibility oscillations observed , can be explained by the interaction between the `` detector '' and `` interference '' edge channels .",
    "the essential parameters of this work are the electron velocity at the detector edge channel and the coupling ( interaction ) strength between the detector and the interference channels .",
    "we believe that , an extension of our present model to a realistic system may contribute to the understanding of the mentioned experiments .",
    "we would like to thank r. r. gerhardts for his fruitful lectures on screening theory , enabling us to understand the basics .",
    "the authors acknowledge the support of the marmaris institute of theoretical and applied physics ( itap ) , tubitak grant @xmath35 , tubap-739 - 754 - 759 , sfb631 and dip .",
    "the color coded @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( a - c ) and corresponding current distribution indicated by the arrows .",
    "the calculations are done at @xmath38 for a fixed external current driven in the @xmath26 direction ( @xmath39 ) , where the 1d current density is set to @xmath40 a / m .",
    "the gates defining the qpc , are taken to be @xmath41 nm apart and biased with @xmath42 v. the 2des is @xmath43 nm below the surface and unit cell is a square with dimensions @xmath44 nm@xmath45 . ]",
