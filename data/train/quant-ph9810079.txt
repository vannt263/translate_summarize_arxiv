    "from the point of view of classical dynamics all phenomena , that are described in the framework of conventional theory of quantum mechanics are stochastic processes .",
    "the natural symmetry between the schrdinger and fokker - plank equations was used both for the formulation of quantum mechanics as a classical stochastic theory @xcite and quantization of classical theory by introduction of the concept of random process @xcite .",
    "note , that in all representations the main object of quantum mechanics , the wave function , is deterministic .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the deterministic nature of a physical theory is a consequence of the symmetry of basic equations with respect to time inversion @xcite .",
    "it is known that the observability is an essential property of objects that is realized when the contact with an external world is established .",
    "therefore , all objects under study are open physical systems . this conclusion implies , in particular , that it is impossible to conform in any reasonable way the probabilistic , irreversible nature of measurements to the reversibility of quantum theory concepts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the stochastic nature is the basic property of the physical world .",
    "this assertion becomes especially conclusive if one allows for the real existence of physical vacuum in the nature that is the cause of casual quantum jumps in the isolated systems @xcite .",
    "in other words , all objects that are investigated taking into account the interaction with fluctuations of the physical vacuum are open physical systems .",
    "whereas the isolated systems are studied by means of methods of conventional quantum mechanics , the behaviour of open systems , in particular of systems that are in equilibrium with the environment , is usually described by the laws of thermodynamics .    since due to permanent fluctuations the open system has no any definite quantum state , i.e.",
    ", the state vector of the system randomly changes with time , the construction of a theory alternative to the reversible quantum mechanics becomes urgent .",
    "one can construct such a theory if , in particular , the random processes taking place in the system are directly included in the foundations of the theory and are not regarded as external perturbations .    in the present work the problem of stochastic quantum mechanics",
    "is investigated using the model of random motion of 1d quantum reactive oscillator ( qrho ) .",
    "mathematically the problem of an evolution of quantum states is formulated in the framework of probabilistic complex process in an extended space with stochastic space - time continuum . for roaming classical oscillator the conditions of reducibility of a model stochastic differential equation ( sde ) to nonlinear langevin sde",
    "are investigated . with the help of model",
    "sde the variables in the sde for a wave functional - the complex probability process , have been separated .",
    "based on the langevin - type sde the fokker - plank equation is derived and the measure of functional space is obtained . for roaming qrho the average wave function",
    "is constructed in the form of functional integral with positive measure .",
    "the local stochastic and averaged transition matrix of the roaming qrho is calculated analytically . the probability of `` vacuum - vacuum '' transition is calculated numerically and its behavior is shown versus the fluctuation parameter .",
