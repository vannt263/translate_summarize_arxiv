    "it has been apparent for many years that the b galaxy number counts may be steeper at bright magnitudes than expected in a homogeneous , unevolving , cosmological model ( shanks et al .",
    "the counts appeared to have a euclidean slope whereas the models predict a much flatter slope due to the expansion and the k - correction .",
    "shanks et al . suggested that these steep counts maybe caused by large - scale galaxy clustering whereas other authors such as maddox et al .",
    "( 1990a ) tended to favour the suggestion that the steepness was due to evolution .",
    "both ideas had difficulties - the unevolved n(z ) at b=17 and b=21 argued against galaxy luminosity evolution , while the local void would have to persist to almost 300@xmath6mpc if the low number counts were caused by galaxy clustering .",
    "most of these authors used counts made from measurements of photographic plates .",
    "this meant that there remained the possibility that these observations were in error , due to non - linearities in the photographic magnitude scales .",
    "more recently it has become possible to survey large areas of the sky with linear ccd detectors . at first these",
    "were used to calibrate the photographic magnitudes but this effort has been hindered by the quite large rms errors in the photographic photometry found even at relatively bright magnitudes .",
    "the ccd detectors are now large enough to provide the survey data by themselves and in this paper we describe a new survey primarily in the 2df galaxy redshift survey areas , using the ctio curtis schmidt ccd camera .",
    "the advent of deeper galaxy redshift surveys such as 2dfgrs opens up a new possibility of investigating the scale at which the local hole ceases to dominate and the universe appears to become homogeneous . in previous surveys such as the durham - ukst galaxy redshift survey , the n(z ) extended to z@xmath10.1 and it was found that count models which quite successfully fitted galaxy counts at b@xmath1018 did not fit the b@xmath017 n(z ) even in the range 0.05@xmath0z@xmath00.1 which might have been thought to be safely outside any local inhomogeneities .",
    "the fact that the model n(z ) over - predicted the observed n(z ) all the way to z=0.1 meant that if the local void hypothesis was correct then the ` hole ' in the galaxy distribution had to extend to z@xmath10.1 or r@xmath1 300 .    in this paper",
    "we first present details of our observations and data reduction in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we use our ctio ccd data to check the calibration of several previous galaxy number counts so that the corrected results from the various authors can be compared to the ctio counts themselves . in section 4",
    "the ctio counts are presented in each band .",
    "the number redshift distributions from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and the durham - ukst redshift survey ( ratcliffe et al . 1998 ) are examined in section 5 to investigate the possible existence of a ` local hole ' in the galaxy distribution in the southern galactic cap ( sgc ) .",
    "a discussion follows in section 6 .",
    "the observations were taken using the 0.6 m curtis schmidt telescope at ctio , la serena , chile .",
    "we had two filters , harris b and r , with magnitude limits of 20.5 and 19.5 respectively , and the imaging data was taken over 2 observing runs of 7 nights , each in excellent weather conditions .",
    "the north galactic cap ( ngc ) observations were taken from 8 - 14 april 1999 inclusive ( observers gsb and ts ) , and the data in the south galactic cap ( sgc ) from 17 - 23 october 2000 inclusive ( observers gsb and pjo ) .",
    "the ccd is a 2048x2048 24 micron chip with 2.3 arcsecond pixels , so that when the bias was subtracted this resulted in a 1.69 degree@xmath4 field of view for each exposure .    in the ngc",
    ", we observed 3 main strips of sky in b and r at declinations of 0 , -5 and -10 degrees , where the equatorial and -5 degree strips overlap with the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( colless et al .",
    "the strips were 1.3 degrees wide , which was dictated by the field of view of the telescope , and had an ra range from 9hrs .",
    "45mins . up to 15hrs .",
    "the strips were joined at the ends by two smaller strips which were constant at declinations of 10hrs and 15 hrs . in total , this gave a potential 300 hundred square degrees of data in our b and r filters , assuming we had photometric conditions throughout all 7 nights .    in the sgc",
    ", we again observed in 3 main strips at constant declinations , this time at -28 , -30 and -32 , with the knowledge that this would completely overlap with the 2dfgrs fields .",
    "the ends of the strips were at ra s of 21hrs .",
    "40mins . and 03hrs . 15mins . because the strips were much closer together than in the ngc , it was possible to connect the strips by simply doing single exposures every half hour of ra at declinations of -29 and -31 degrees .",
    "in addition to these three long strips of @xmath11 100 square degrees each , we also observed a shorter strip at a declination of -45 degrees from an ra of 02hrs . to 02hrs .",
    "45mins . giving an area of @xmath12 square degrees .",
    "in total this gave us an imaging area in the sgc of 337 square degrees .",
    "the format of our observations would be to take two standard star frames of suitable landolt equatorial fields in each band at the beginning , the middle and the end of each night .",
    "we would then begin the observations in our chosen field by taking an exposure in the r band for 120 seconds and stop the tracking of the telescope for 1 min 18 seconds ( when observing in the north , 1 min .",
    "30 secs . in the south ) , so that the sky moved over by one quarter of the ccd chip .",
    "this 1 min 18 seconds was sufficient to let the ccd read out which took @xmath13 seconds .",
    "an exposure of the same length of time would then be taken in the b filter , and so on .",
    "the result would be a series of frames at a constant declination in the sky where each frame overlapped its adjacent frames in the same filter by about half a chip",
    ". we would typically be able to cover about 90 mins .",
    "of ra ( 30 deg@xmath4 ) using this method before the sky was too far over and we would then move the telescope and begin again .",
    "the bias was subtracted , images trimmed and bad pixels corrected using the iraf quadproc package . typically , five or six dawn and twilight flat field images were taken in each bandpass . a master flat field image was produced in each filter for each night by first using the imcombine routine to median together each of the dawn flats and evening flats separately .",
    "the resulting frames were then averaged to produce our b and r master flats for that night . by dividing the median - ed dawn and twilight flats we typically found a 1 - 2% gradient from top to bottom of the resulting frame , implying an error of about 0.005 - 0.01 to our galaxy photometry due to this effect .",
    "the frames for a particular night in each filter were then flat - fielded using the iraf ccdproc package and the appropriate flat - field master frame .      the fact that adjacent frames of the same filter overlapped by half - a - chip meant that a detailed analysis of the photometric conditions throughout each night could be performed .",
    "the results of this photometric analysis are shown in table [ table : photo ] .",
    "given that the weather was so good during both observing runs we decided to enforce a relatively strict criterion to determine the nature of the observing conditions .",
    "a night was deemed partially photometric if two or more adjacent frames show significant offsets ( @xmath14 mag ) from each other when performing best fits to the magnitude residuals of the stars .",
    "if a particular night was deemed to be `` partially photometric '' then none of the frames were used on the strip where the @xmath14 magnitude offset was found .    .",

    "( 2001 ) @xmath29 is used .",
    "the motivation for these variable @xmath29 models is to locate the structure in the n(z ) which dominates the bright galaxy counts .",
    "recall that the dukst n(z ) indicates three distinct deficiencies in the galaxy distribution below z@xmath10.1 .",
    "the dukst z@xmath420.09 and z@xmath420.06 models were constructed then in order to see the effect on the predicted number counts , assuming that just the first two and then all three of these holes have significant effects on the galaxy counts .",

    "[ fig : countsb_photcorr ] with the homogeneous model still indicates a 25% deficiency over the full 4300 deg@xmath4 of the apm southern survey .",
    "the conclusion from these variable @xmath29 models then is that the southern b - band counts are most consistent with there being a galaxy number discrepancy for z0.1 , which is of order @xmath125% .",
    "these results agree very well with those of frith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who investigated the angular extent of the hypothesised deficiency of galaxies in the sgc using the publicly available 2mass second incremental release data .",
    "the authors took @xmath44 declination slices in the ngc and sgc with ra ranges similar to that of the 2df regions , and plotted galaxy number counts in the k - band . in total twelve declination slices of data , each of @xmath45 deg@xmath4 ,",
    "were analysed totalling @xmath46 deg@xmath4 from the two galactic caps .",
    "since the apm , 2df sgc and dukst survey areas overlap with the three of the southern 2mass strips , the work done by frith et al .",
    "is extremely relevant to the discussion in this paper .",
    "their conclusions also show strong evidence for a significant under - density of @xmath130% in the galaxy number density in their sgc areas .",
    "this agrees well with the 25% deficiency that we have shown in this paper is implied by the apm and apmbgc data .",
    "the dukst field then extends further south than is currently sampled by 2mass , to @xmath47=-43@xmath48 and the apm area even further to @xmath47=-70@xmath48 .",
    "this then implies a hole in the sgc galaxy distribution of 100@xmath48x60@xmath48 , which extends to z@xmath10.1 .",
    "this corresponds to a huge volume of space of @xmath110@xmath7  @xmath8  mpc@xmath9 and implies significant power on large scales of @xmath11100 - 200 .    to illustrate how excess power on larger scales increases the chances of finding a 25% galaxy deficiency over these volume sizes ,",
    "we have used the 3-d analogue of equation 45.6 in peebles ( 1980 ) . by assuming a power law form of the spatial two - point correlation function out to a given scale length",
    ", we can calculate the probability of finding a given number deficiency of galaxies over a volume of space defined by a sphere of radius 150@xmath6mpc . in this simplified scenario ,",
    "the fluctuation in galaxy number over the expected galaxy number can be written as :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the two - point spatial function and v is the volume of the sphere over which a particular survey is sampling .",

    "we assume two cases , each corresponding to a different value of r@xmath54 . in the first case r@xmath54=10@xmath6mpc .",
    "if we set @xmath56=@xmath58 , where we assume @xmath59=0.01 which is the mean galaxy density in units of @xmath60mpc@xmath31 , then we find that @xmath61/@xmath56=0.016 .",
    "this corresponds to an expected galaxy number fluctuation over our sphere of radius 150@xmath6mpc of 1.6% and therefore means that finding a galaxy number deficiency of 25% over our sphere is a 15.6@xmath62 result , although it is difficult to judge how much the @xmath63 selection is affecting this result .",
    "however , if we assume our second case where r@xmath54=150@xmath6mpc then we find an expected galaxy number fluctation of 8% .",
    "this is a 3.75@xmath62 result and so a power law correlation function extending to 150   is starting to be more consistent with the observation of the local underdensity .",
    "we take the @xmath5cdm real - space correlation function of padilla & baugh ( 2003 ) , which we have modelled by two power laws of @xmath64=-1.7 and @xmath64=-3.44 with a break at r@xmath65=30 .",
    "this overestimates the @xmath5cdm @xmath50 at all scales for r@xmath66 .",
    "even so , integrating this model to r@xmath55=150 , we find that a 1@xmath62 fluctuation is of order 4.8% indicating that our 25% observed fluctuation is a 5@xmath62 deviation .",
    "we conclude that there may be more power required at large scales than in the @xmath5cdm @xmath50 ; although biasing the galaxy distribution could improve the agreement , in standard versions of the @xmath5cdm model the galaxy distribution is predicted to be unbiased on large scales .",
    "the implied excess power is also in contradiction with the currently observed forms for the apm and 2dfgrs correlation functions ( hawkins et al .",
    "either these correlation functions have underestimated the amount of power at large scales or the galaxy distribution in the sgc is atypical of the overall distribution of galaxies .",
    "we are therefore currently reanalysing the correlation functions of the 2dfgrs to check whether any such problem exists ( frith et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper we first presented the resulting galaxy counts from our ctio curtis schmidt data . the large deficiency of galaxies seen in the sgc motivated us to investigate the possible existence of a large `` hole '' in the sgc galaxy distribution .",
    "using our ctio data , covering 300 deg@xmath4 in the sgc , we were able to make the first ever detailed checks of the bright ( b@xmath017 ) galaxy photometry in the dukst , 2dfgrs and apm surveys which has crucial implications for the existence of a local hole in the distribution of galaxies .",
    "our conclusions are :    * our b - band galaxy counts in the ngc agree extremely well with the model of metcalfe et al .",

    "* we compared our ccd galaxy catalogue to that of the 2dfgrs in the ngc and sgc . in the ngc",
