    "superfluidity , as a remarkable macroscopic quantum phenomenon , was first discovered in the study of liquid helium 4 in the 1938  @xcite .",
    "although it is found theoretically that superfluidity is a general phenomenon for interacting boson systems  @xcite , liquid helium had been the only bosonic superfluid available in experiments until 1995 . in this year , thanks to the advance of laser cooling of atoms , the bose - einstein condensation of dilute alkali atomic gases was realized experimentally  @xcite ; a new superfluid , bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , was born .",
    "this addition to the family of superfluids is highly non - trivial as becs offer various aspects of advantages over liquid helium that can greatly enrich our understanding of superfluidity .",
    "great deal of work has been done to explore the properties of liquid helium as superfluid  @xcite .",
    "however , these efforts have been hindered by limitations of liquid helium . as a liquid ,",
    "the superfluid helium is strongly - interacting system , which makes the theoretical description difficult . at the same time , no system parameters , such as density and interaction strength , can be tuned experimentally . and helium 4 has no spin degrees of freedom .",
    "becs are strikingly different .",
    "almost all the parameters of a bec can be controlled easily in experiments : its kinetic energy , density , and the interaction between atoms can all be tuned easily by engineering the atom - laser interaction , magnetic or optical traps , and the feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by choosing the atomic species and using optical trap to release the spin degrees of freedom , one can also realize various types of new superfluids , including the spinor superfluid  @xcite and the dipolar superfluid  @xcite .",
    "all these are impossible with liquid helium . moreover , as most ultracold gases are dilute and weakly - interacting , controllable theoretical methods are available to study these superfluids in detail .    in this review",
    "we mainly discuss three types of bosonic superfluids : superfluid with periodic density , superfluid with spin - orbit coupling , and superfluid of pure spin current .",
    "the focus is on the stability and critical velocities of various superfluids . for a uniform superfluid ,",
    "when its speed exceeds a critical value , the system suffers landau instability and superfluidity is lost .",
    "when the superfluid moves in a periodic potential , with large enough quasi - momentum , new mechanism of instability , i.e. , dynamical instability comes in .",
    "this instability usually dominates the landau instability as it occurs on a much faster time scale .",
    "the periodic density also brings another twist : the superfluidity can be tested in two different ways , which yield two different critical velocities . for a superfluid with spin - orbit coupling , a dramatic change is brought in , namely the breakdown of galilean invariance . as a result ,",
    "its critical velocity will depend on the reference frame .",
    "the stability of a pure spin current is also quite striking .",
    "we find that the pure spin current in general is not a super - flow .",
    "however , it can be stabilized to become a super - flow with quadratic zeeman effect or spin - orbit coupling .",
    "related experimental proposals are discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ basics ] , we discuss briefly the basic concepts related to the understanding of superfluidity , including landau s theory of superfluidity , mean field gross - pitaevskii equation , and bogoliubov excitations .",
    "these concepts are illustrated with the special case of a uniform superfluid .",
    "we then apply these general methods to study in detail the superfluid in periodic potentials in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "superfluid is a special kind of fluid which does not suffer dissipation when flowing through a tube .",
    "it loses its superfluidity only when its speed exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the superfluidity of liquid helium 4 was first explained by l. d. landau  @xcite .",
    "he considered a superfluid moving inside a stationary tube with velocity @xmath0 .",
    "since the system is invariant under the galilean transformation , this scenario is equivalent to a stationary fluid inside a moving tube . if the elementary excitation in a stationary superfluid with momentum @xmath1 has energy @xmath2 , then the energy of the same excitation in the background of a moving fluid with @xmath0 is @xmath3 .",
    "a fluid experiences friction only through emitting elementary excitations , and it is a superfluid if these elementary excitations are energetically unfavorable . in other words ,",
    "a superfluid satisfies the constraint @xmath4 .",
    "it readily leads to the well - known landau s criterion for superfluid , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the critical velocity of the superfluid , which is determined by the smallest slope of the excitation spectrum of a stationary superfluid .",
    "another way of deriving the formula of critical velocity is from the point view of cerenkov radiation .",
    "consider a macroscopic impurity moving in the superfluid generates an excitation .",
    "according to the conservations of both momentum and energy , we should have @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass of the impurity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the initial and final velocities of the impurity , respectively .",
    "the above two conservations ( [ co1 ] ) and ( [ co2 ] ) can not be satisfied simultaneously when @xmath11 the critical velocity @xmath12 here has the same expression as that obtained from landau s criterion . if the excitations are phonons , i.e. , @xmath13 , then @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the impurity could not generate phonons in the superfluid and would not experience any viscosity when its speed was smaller than the sound speed .",
    "this is in fact nothing but the cerenkov radiation  @xcite , where a charged particle radiates only when its speed exceeds the speed of light in the medium .    .",
    "( c ) an impurity moves at @xmath15 in the superfluid .",
    "the two - way arrow indicates the equivalence between different scenarios.,width=302 ]    these two different ways of derivation are equivalent when the system has the galilean invariance . by transforming to another reference frame illustrated in fig .",
    "[ gi](b ) , the superfluid can be viewed as being dragged by a moving tube .",
    "we then replace the moving tube with a macroscopic impurity moving inside the superfluid as shown in fig .",
    "[ gi](c ) . consequently",
    ", for systems with galilean invariance , the critical velocity of a superfluid moving inside a tube without experiencing friction is just the critical velocity of an impurity moving in a superfluid without generating excitations . for systems without the galilean invariance ,",
    "such an equivalence is lost as we will see later with the spin - orbit coupled bec .    for ultracold bosonic gases , the low energy excitation is phonon , linear with respect to momentum @xmath1 , thus the critical speed of this superfluid is just the sound speed . taking into account the non - uniformity of the trapped gas ,",
    "the critical velocity measured in experiments agrees well with the value predicted by landau s theory  @xcite . for liquid helium 4 ,",
    "as there is another kind of elementary excitations called rotons , the critical speed of superfluid helium 4 is largely determined by the roton excitation , much smaller than its sound speed . nevertheless , the critical velocity measured in experiments is still one order of magnitude smaller than the value predicted by the theory  @xcite .",
    "so it is remarkable that landau s prediction of critical velocity was experimentally confirmed with bec almost six decades after its invention .",
    "one remark is warranted on landau s theory of superfluidity .",
    "landau s criterion ( [ min ] ) of critical speed does not apply for many superfluids .",
    "however , landau s energetic argument for superfluidity is very general and can be applied to all the cases considered in this review .",
    "we shall use this argument to determine the critical speeds of various superfluids .      as liquid helium 4",
    "is a strongly interacting system , the calculation of its excitation spectrum theoretically is challenging .",
    "however , for a dilute ultracold bosonic gases , convenient yet precise approximations can be made to determine its excitation in theory . due to the dilute nature and short range interaction , the interaction between atoms can be approximated by a contact interaction .",
    "furthermore , for low energy scattering of bosonic atoms , the @xmath16-wave scattering channel dominates .",
    "so , as a good approximation , the actual complex interaction between atoms is replaced by an effective @xmath16-wave contact interaction , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath16-wave scattering length . at zero temperature ,",
    "assume all the particles condense into the same orbit @xmath19 , then its evolution is governed by the mean field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trapping potential or other external potential , and @xmath22 is the interaction parameter or coupling constant . the gp energy functional reads @xmath23=\\int d\\mathbf{r}\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2+v(\\mathbf{r})|\\psi|^2 + \\frac{c}{2}|\\psi|^4\\right].\\ ] ] note that here the wave function @xmath24 is normalized to the total particle number @xmath25 .",
    "the approximation we make here is the mean field approximation , and the interaction between atoms is replaced by an effective mean field potential .",
    "the validity of the approximation usually depends on the condensed fraction . for weakly interacting dilute bosonic gases near zero temperature",
    ", the condensed fraction can be more than 90 percent . in these situations ,",
    "the gp equation works well .",
    "it has been used to calculate the collective excitations of trapped bec , as well as vortex dynamics .",
    "pretty good agreement is achieved between theory and experiment . with a stochastic term describing the effect of thermal atoms ,",
    "the modified stochastic gp equation can also simulate bec systems at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for atoms with spin , one can also derive a multicomponent gp equation to describe a spinor superfluid  @xcite .",
    "the stationary state the gp equation describes is a zeroth order approximation in some sense .",
    "it only takes into account the interaction between the condensed particles .",
    "the first order approximation is to take into account the interaction between the condensed particles and un - condensed particles .",
    "this is settled by the bogoliubov theory of elementary excitations  @xcite .",
    "the standard bogoliubov theory is to diagonalize the mean field hamiltonian by the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "here we adopt an equivalent yet more convenient way to deal with this problem in inhomogeneous systems . for a stationary state @xmath26 that satisfies the gp equation , we consider some small time dependent perturbations @xmath27 added to this stationary state .",
    "the perturbed state @xmath28 also satisfies the gp equation , @xmath29 expanding this equation to first order in the perturbation @xmath30 , one arrives at the equation of motion of the perturbation @xmath27 , @xmath31 and its complex conjugate partner . assume the state before perturbation is a stationary state with the wave function @xmath32 , and write the perturbations as @xmath33 $ ] , then we arrive at a pair of equations that @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy , @xmath36 where the matrix @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 . by diagonalizing @xmath37 , one obtains two sets of solutions , but only the solution satisfying the constraint @xmath40 represents physical excitations .",
    "note that since the characteristic matrix @xmath37 is not hermitian , its eigenvalues are not necessarily real .",
    "if its eigenvalue @xmath41 has nonzero imaginary part , the perturbation @xmath42 $ ] will grow exponentially with time , signaling that the state before perturbation suffers _",
    "dynamical instability_. if its eigenvalue is real but negative , elementary excitations associated with the perturbations will be energetically favorable and superfluidity is lost , which is called _",
    "landau instability_. for the excitations of repulsive bose gases without external potentials , the low energy excitations must be non - negative and gapless from the hugenholtz - pines theorem  @xcite .    as a specific example",
    ", we apply the above formalism to the uniform bose gas , namely , putting @xmath43 . the wave function before perturbation is just @xmath44 , and the perturbation has this form @xmath45 , @xmath46 . plugging these wave functions into the above equations , one immediately obtains the excitation spectrum for a uniform bose gas , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the single particle spectrum . at long wavelength or small momentum @xmath49 ,",
    "the excitation has the asymptotic form @xmath50 .",
    "this is nothing but phonon excitation , and @xmath51 is just the speed of sound . from landau s theory of critical velocity ,",
    "we conclude that the critical velocity of a uniform superfluid bose gas is just the sound speed .",
    "the method of mean field approximation and bogoliubov transformation is very general , and applies in other more complicated situations . in the following discussion , we use this method to study three types of superfluids , superfluid in a periodic potential , superfluid with spin - orbit coupling and superfluid of pure spin current .",
    "it is hard to change the density of helium 4 as it is a liquid . in contrast",
    ", we can easily modulate the density of a bec which is a gas .",
    "when we put a bec in an optical lattice , we obtain a superfluid whose density is periodically modulated .",
    "one can even further periodically modulate the interatomic interaction of the bec with optical feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "supersolid helium 4 may be also regarded as a periodic superfluid as it can be viewed as some superfluid defects ( most likely vacancies ) flowing in a helium solid lattice  @xcite . in this section , we use a bec in an optical lattice as an example to examine the properties of a periodic superfluid .",
    "compared to the uniform superfluid in free space , a new type of instability , i.e. , the dynamical instability is found when the quasi - momentum @xmath52 of the superfluid is larger than a critical value .",
    "usually the dynamical instability dominates the accompanying landau instability as it happens on a much faster time scale  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the periodic potential also brings along another critical velocity .",
    "now we study the superfluidity of a bec in a periodic potential  @xcite , which is provided by the optical lattice in cold atom experiments . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a quasi - one - dimensional bec , confined in a cigar - shaped trap .",
    "we treat the system with the mean field theory and obtain the grand - canonical gp hamiltonian @xmath53,\\ ] ] where all the variables are scaled to be dimensionless with respect to a set of characteristic parameters of the system , the atomic mass @xmath54 , the wave number @xmath55 of the laser light generating the optical lattice , and the average density @xmath56 of the bec .",

    "the interaction constant is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the @xmath16-wave scattering length .",
    "for non - interacting case ( @xmath66 ) , diagonalizing the hamiltonian will give the standard bloch waves and energy bands .",
    "when the mean field interaction is turned on ( @xmath67 ) , in principle the hamiltonian allows for other types of solutions which have no counterpart in the non - interacting case  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the solutions which still have the form of bloch waves , i.e. , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 has the same period with the optical lattice .",
    "@xmath69 can be found by extremizing the hamiltonian above  @xcite .",
    "the solution found in this way should satisfy the stationary gp equation with periodic potential , @xmath70    to determine the superfluidity of these bloch states , we must consider elementary excitations around these bloch states , and check whether the excitation energy is always positive .",
    "positive excitation energy indicates that the bloch state is a local energy minimum , and it is stable against small perturbations . due to the periodicity of the bloch wave",
    ", the perturbations can be decomposed into different decoupled modes labeled by @xmath49 , @xmath71 where @xmath49 ranges between @xmath72 and @xmath73 and the perturbation functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are of periodicity of @xmath76 .    following the similar method in sec .",

    "the above equation is just the resonance condition between such excitations in the lowest band ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can write the resonance condition as @xmath102 so , this condition may be viewed as the energy and momentum conservation for two particles interacting and decaying into two different bloch states @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this is the same physical picture behind eq .",
    "( [ eq : kqc ] ) .",
    "one common feature of all the diagrams in fig.[fig : kq ] is that there are two critical bloch wave numbers , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "beyond @xmath105 the bloch waves @xmath81 suffer the landau instability ; beyond @xmath106 the bloch waves @xmath81 are dynamically unstable .",
    "the onset of instability at @xmath106 always corresponds to @xmath107 . in other words , if we drive the bloch state @xmath81 from @xmath108 to @xmath109 the first unstable mode appearing is always @xmath110 , which represents period doubling . only for @xmath111 can longer wavelength instabilities occur .",
    "the growth of these unstable modes drives the system far away from the bloch state and spontaneously breaks the translational symmetry of the system .      besides inducing the dynamical instability , the presence of the optical lattice has also non - trivial consequences on the concept of critical velocity .",
    "in contrast to the homogeneous superfluid which has only one critical velocity , there are two distinct critical velocities for a periodic superfluid  @xcite . the first one , which we call inside critical velocity , is for an impurity to move frictionlessly in the periodic superfluid system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slatt](a ) ) ; the second , which is called trawler critical velocity , is the largest velocity of the lattice for the superfluidity to maintain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slatt](b ) ) .",
    "we illustrate these two critical velocities with a bec in a one - dimensional optical lattice .     inside a superfluid residing in a periodic potential .",
    "the superfluid and periodic potential are `` locked '' together and there is no relative motion between them .",
    "( b ) the lattice where a superfluid resides is slowly accelerated to a velocity of @xmath112 . , width=302 ]    the presence of the optical lattice plays a decisive role in the appearance of the two critical velocities : two very different situations can arise .",

    "for phonon excitations , i.e. , @xmath13 , these two conservations can always be satisfied simultaneously no matter how small the velocity of the impurity is .",
    "in other words , the critical velocity for this scenario is exactly zero .    in the other scenario ,",

    "<S> liquid helium 4 had been the only bosonic superfluid available in experiments for a long time . this situation was changed in 1995 , when a new superfluid was born with the realization of the bose - einstein condensation in ultracold atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid helium 4 is strongly interacting and has no spin ; there is almost no way to change its parameters , such as interaction strength and density . </S>",
    "<S> the new superfluid , bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , offers various aspects of advantages over liquid helium . on the one hand , bec is weakly interacting and has spin degrees of freedom . on the other hand , it is convenient to tune almost all the parameters of a bec , for example , the kinetic energy by spin - orbit coupling , the density by the external potential , and the interaction by feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> great efforts have been devoted to studying these new aspects of superfluidity , and the results have greatly enriched our understanding of superfluidity . here </S>",
    "<S> we review these developments by focusing on the stability and critical velocity of various superfluids . </S>",
    "<S> the bec systems considered include a uniform superfluid in free space , a superfluid with its density periodically modulated , a superfluid with artificially engineered spin - orbit coupling , and a superfluid of pure spin current . </S>",
    "<S> due to the weak interaction , these bec systems can be well described by the mean field gross - pitaevskii theory and their superfluidity , in particular critical velocities , can be examined with landau s theory of superfluid . experimental proposals to observe these new aspects of superfluidity </S>",
    "<S> are discussed .    </S>"
