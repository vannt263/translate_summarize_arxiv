    "therefore , @xmath99 and @xmath109 have the same tm phase distribution .",
    "let us see what this implies for the input state considered by torgerson and mandel , two weak coherent states .",
    "we have for @xmath115 @xmath116 a consequence of the result in the previous paragraph is that the state @xmath117 has the same tm phase distribution as @xmath102 which is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) , i.e. @xmath118 this fact has been noted by nfm @xcite .",
    "torgerson and mandel pointed out that the agreement between the above phase distribution , which agreed with their measurements , and the london distribution for @xmath102 is poor .",
    "suppose we instead compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) to the london distribution for the state @xmath109 .",
    "we find that they are identical .",
    "one interpretation of these results is the following .",
    "if @xmath119 is taken to be the tm phase distribution of @xmath102 one has the rather puzzling result that as @xmath120 and @xmath90 go to zero , with @xmath121 fixed , the phase distribution does not change .",
    "one would expect that as @xmath102 becomes closer to the vacuum its phase distribution would become more uniform . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath122 is interpreted as the phase distribution for @xmath109 the puzzle disappears .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath90 go to zero , with @xmath121 fixed , the state @xmath109 does not change and , therefore , neither should its phase distribution .",
    "furthermore , its operational phase distribution ( obtained via the direct measurement procedure ) agrees with its london phase distribution .",
    "because it discards data , the measurement procedure of torgerson and mandel is insensitive to the vacuum component of input states , which , along with the previous two observations , suggests that what is being measured is the phase distribution of @xmath109 and not that of @xmath102 .",
    "this observation is closely related to one by hradil in his discussion of the original noh , fougres , and mandel proposal  @xcite .",
    "another objection which can be raised to the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) as a phase distribution for @xmath102 has to do with the connection between a phase distribution and the rotational properties of its corresponding state in phase space .",
    "a useful property for a phase distribution to have is providing information about how distinguishable a state is from a rotated version of itself",
    ". a phase distribution with this property will be able to tell us how useful a given state is for the measurement of phase shifts . in the case of two - mode states",
    "we would like the difference - phase distribution of a state @xmath123 to give us information about @xmath124 , which is a measure of how distinguishable @xmath123 is from its difference - phase rotated version , @xmath125 . here",
    "the operator @xmath126 $ ] rotates mode 1 by @xmath127 and mode 2 by @xmath128 , thereby changing the phase difference between the modes by @xmath129 . for @xmath102",
    "we find @xmath130 which goes to one as @xmath120 and @xmath90 go to zero .",
    "this shows that @xmath102 and its rotated version become indistinguishable in this limit and @xmath102 would be of little use in detecting a phase shift .",
    "this is contrary to what one sees from the tm phase distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) . if @xmath131 the tm phase distributions @xmath122 and @xmath132 are clearly distinguishable if @xmath129 is , for example , @xmath133 while according to eq .",

    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) implies that if @xmath131 and @xmath136 , then @xmath114 and its rotated version can be distinguished which is consistent with what we expect from its london distribution .",
    "this again suggests interpreting the tm phase distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) as being associated with @xmath114 rather than @xmath102 .",
    "it should be noted that if all of the data is kept these questions of interpretation do not arise . in that case",
    "the vacuum state does contribute to the phase distribution and the phase distributions for @xmath102 and @xmath109 are no longer the same .",
    "in section  [ sec : direct ] we have discussed two possibilities of data analysis and have shown the phase distributions corresponding to retaining or discarding ambiguous data . in this section",
    "we briefly return to this point .",
    "the data analysis used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) and ( [ eq : p1 ] ) may be compactly summarized by considering the distribution for the random variable @xmath137 given the distribution @xmath138 for the random variables @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "this can be written as @xmath141 when the data , which in this case is a pair @xmath142 , unambiguously determines @xmath143 the above formula is trivial ; however , when the data leads to no single @xmath143 then we must make the assignment based on other considerations .",
    "we suggest spreading the probability evenly amongst the consistent values  uniformly across the @xmath144 radians .",
    "this is consistent with a maximum entropy assignment given no other information about the incoming state .",
    "in contrast the approach used in refs . @xcite discards data obtained for @xmath14 .",
    "the excluded data does not appear to be very useful for informing us about phase .",
    "thus , it is justifiable to select only the unambiguous data as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , a comparison of the behavior of the direct scheme without and with postselection for weak fields , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : direct - with ] ) and  ( [ eq : direct - mandel ] ) respectively , shows that the latter has a significantly narrower distribution .",
    "we have argued in the previous section that one resolution of this apparent paradox is that by discarding data we are changing the state which we measure .",
    "another way of looking at this issue is in terms of the sensitivity of the measurement .",
    "it seems that when data is discarded we achieve a greater measurement sensitivity , because the resulting phase distribution is narrower than would be the case if all the data were kept . how can we reconcile this with shannon s information theory which teaches us that we can not improve sensitivity by discarding information",
    "it must be that the apparent difference in widths  and naively sensitivity  for these two distributions is in some sense illusory .",
    "the resolution to this ` paradox ' is that the discarded data carries information about the overall resources used which would need to be factored into any meaningful measure of sensitivity .",
    "the deeper question of how we may compare phase distributions between different schemes , with respect to the cost of resources involved , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , it is clear that for states of very small photon number most measurements will yield a null result and will have to be thrown out . therefore",
    ", a large number of measurements will have to be made in order to obtain only a few usable ones , which suggests a large expenditure of resources , and a corresponding decrease of sensitivity .",
    "we may generate the distribution for the relative phases of a pair of coherent states @xmath145 and @xmath146 using the direct or indirect schemes described here .",
    "our results confirm torgerson and mandel s claim of the non - uniqueness of operational phase operators ; the two measurement procedures lead to different phase distributions .    a real comparison between the schemes sensitivity must await a careful analysis of the resources used .",
    "notwithstanding this , we shall make a zeroth - order comparison here in the absence of postselection . as we noted already above ( section  [ sec : indirect - strong ] ) in the strong field limit ( @xmath147 and @xmath148 ) the two schemes , direct and indirect , go to the same distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) . in the weak fields",
    "limit we have calculated , however , the situation is somewhat more interesting : the direct scheme reproduces the statistics of the london distribution ( also called suskind - glogower or pegg - barnett ) applied to the difference - phase @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the indirect scheme produces a phase distribution which is slightly broader by the ratio of @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "these facts surprised the authors : both that one scheme is a realization of the london distribution in the limit where both input fields are weak coherent states , and that the other scheme does not perform identically .",
