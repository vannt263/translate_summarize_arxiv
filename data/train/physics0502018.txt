    "photoionization of two - electron atoms has been studied theoretically by different authors starting from the pioneering paper by @xcite .",
    "review of early literature on this subject can be found in ref .",
    "subsequently , a large number of computations of helium photoionization cross - sections was reported @xcite .",
    "these calculations produced a collection of results varying typically by 5% from each other . on the experimental side , the benchmark set of data was reported by @xcite who measured the total photoionization cross - section of he in the photon energy range from the threshold to 120 ev .",
    "agreement between the theoretical and experimental data was within the same margin of 5% . in the following years , the theoretical interest shifted towards calculation of differential characteristics of the photoionization process and to studies of double photoionization . here , several approaches have been advocated including the many - body perturbation theory @xcite , convergent close - coupling method @xcite , time - dependent close - coupling method @xcite , @xmath0-matrix approach @xcite , and methods based on the computation of the dipole response function @xcite or @xmath1-spline implementations of the exterior complex scaling @xcite .    due to this shift of focus",
    ", there have been no further attempt to produce a consistent set of photoionization cross - sections of he with an accuracy better than several percent .",
    "@xcite combined measurements of @xcite at low energies and theoretical calculations at high energies to construct a set of photoionization cross sections of he that should be reliable at all energies . however , there was no consistency check applied to the experimental data",
    ". in the meantime , accurate helium photoionization cross - sections would be highly desirable due to importance of he in astrophysics and its use as a standard gas in determination of the photoionizaiton cross - sections of other atomic and molecular species .    in the present paper ,",
    "we develop the complex rotation method ( crm ) for highly accurate calculations of the total photoionization cross - section of two - electron atomic targets .",
    "one way of calculating the photoionization cross - section is to combine the crm technique with the perturbation theory with respect to interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic field .",
    "in such a perturbation theory , the crm provides the basis of the field - free atomic states .",
    "it was demonstrated by @xcite that relying on the spectrum of the crm eigenvalues , one can construct a representation of the complete green s function of the atom .",
    "this , in turn , allows to write down a convenient representation for the projection operator corresponding to the continuous spectrum of the atom @xcite . using this projection operator ,",
    "one can compute probabilities of transitions into continuum under the action of some perturbation , in particular , the interaction of the atom with the electromagnetic field . calculations of total photoionization cross - sections of the helium atom based on this technique have been reported in refs .",
    "similar ideas were also used to determine static and dynamic polarizabilities of helium @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we use the crm procedure in a somewhat different , non - perturbative way by applying it to the whole system the atom plus the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , we are capable of going beyond the perturbation theory and considering very strong fields . in this respect ,",
    "the present technique has certain features in common with refs .",
    "@xcite , where an approach based on the configuration interaction procedure was developed for atoms with more than one electron .",
    "we cast our formalism using the language of square - integrable functions with a finite norm .",
    "this approach becomes feasible in the so - called floquet - fourie representation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "another key ingredient of the present work is the hylleraas basis functions which have long been used in various variational - type calculations .",
    "an excellent review of applications of the hylleraas basis to calculations of energies of two - electron atoms is given by @xcite .",
    "a well - known trademark of the hylleraas basis set is a very high accuracy of the atomic energies . in the present paper ,",
    "we show that the same high accuracy which is achieved for field - free atomic states can also be attained when the atom is subjected to a monochromatic electromagnetic field .",
    "in particular , the total photoionization cross - sections can be calculated with an accuracy of the order of a fraction of a percent .",
    "thus generated cross - sections were compared with the experimental results of @xcite .",
    "we discovered a systematic deviation from the experiment , especially in the region close to double ionization threshold at the photon energies of @xmath280  ev .",
    "this deviation was confirmed by comparison with earlier results produced by the convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) method @xcite .",
    "the true potential of the present method is realized in the strong field regime where the perturbation theory fails .",
    "as demonstrated below , the floquet - fourie - hylleraas ansatz produces very accurate results in this regime as well .",
    "the non - relativistic hamiltonian of the helium atom in the presence of the external monochromatic linearly - polarized electromagnetic field can be written as : @xmath3 where , @xmath4 is a kinetic term : @xmath5 @xmath6 potential energy term : @xmath7 and @xmath8 describes interaction of atom and the field . in the length gauge ( which will be used in the present paper ) , this operator assumes the form : @xmath9 with @xmath10 . unless stated otherwise , the atomic units are used throughout the paper .",
    "we write the solution of the time - dependent schrodinger equation ( tdse ) using the floquet - fourie ansatz @xcite @xmath11 by substituting this expression into the tdse and equating coefficients with @xmath12 , we obtain a chain of coupled equations for the floquet - fourie coefficients @xmath13 : @xmath14 we solve this set of equations with the help of the complex rotation procedure @xcite .",
    "formally , the cmr can be described as a complex transformation of radial variables @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the rotation angle , the sole parameter defining the transformation .    under this transformation ,",
    "the chain of equations ( [ fl1 ] ) is converted into @xmath17 according to the general theory of crm @xcite , the set of equations ( [ fl2 ] ) can be solved by means of variational techniques if the rotation angle @xmath16 is properly chosen .",
    "we introduce a basis set of square integrable functions @xmath18 where the index @xmath19 refers to the number of the floquet block and the index @xmath20 denotes a particular @xmath21 function in the subspace of the @xmath19-th block so that @xmath22 . with these notations , the set of eqs.([fl2 ] ) can be rewritten in a matrix form as : @xmath23 notations can be further simplified by introducing obvious shorthands : @xmath24 where it is understood that summation is carried over the repeated @xmath20-index .",
    "here @xmath25 , and @xmath0 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for the overlap , kinetic energy and potential energy matrices , respectively .",
    "one could say here a few words about the choice of the basis allowed by the structure of the system ( [ fl5 ] ) .",
    "suppose first , that in each of the subspaces corresponding to different floquet blocks we chose some compete set of functions , such that for any @xmath13 in eq.([fl2 ] ) we had : @xmath28 .",
    "let the set of @xmath29 s be the same for all floquet subspaces . then , if we have retained @xmath30 floquet blocks in the system ( [ fl2 ] ) and keep @xmath31 terms in the expansion for each @xmath13 in eq.([fl2 ] ) we have altogether @xmath32 unknowns @xmath33 in the system ( [ fl2 ] ) . to get a correctly posed eigenvalue problem , we should have the same number of equations .",
    "this number is provided by projecting each of the equations ( [ fl2 ] ) on one of the @xmath29 s with @xmath34 .",
    "this way of reducing the set of equations ( [ fl2 ] ) to the form of matrix eigenvalue problem is correct , but too general for our purposes .",
    "it can be seen , that one can considerably diminish the resulting dimension of the matrix eigenvalue problem by using certain symmetry properties of the system eq.([fl2 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see , that this system allows the following class of solutions : @xmath13 s with even @xmath19 are of even parity , while @xmath13 s with odd @xmath19 are of odd parity .",
    "parity here is understood with respect to the spatial inversion .",
    "of course , there is a class of solutions with the opposite property : @xmath13 s with even @xmath19 are of odd parity , while @xmath13 s with odd @xmath19 are of even parity .",
    "the solution we are looking for ( which is to describe behavior of the even @xmath35 state of helium ) evidently belongs to the first class .",
    "we can therefore , choose the basis set as follows .    instead of choosing the same set @xmath29 for each floquet block ,",
    "we choose two sets : a set @xmath36 , consisting of basis finctions of even parity , is used as a basis to represent @xmath13 s with even @xmath19 s .",
    "another set @xmath37 , composed of odd parity functions is used as a basis to represent @xmath13 s with odd @xmath19 s .",
    "suppose that in the expansions of @xmath13 s with even @xmath19 s we retain @xmath38 terms , and in the expansions of @xmath13 s with odd @xmath19 s - @xmath39 terms .",
    "let the number of floquet blocks with even and odd @xmath19 s be respectively @xmath40 and @xmath41 . than we have @xmath42 unknown coefficients @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain the same number of equations by projecting equations ( [ fl2 ] ) on @xmath43 for even @xmath19 and on @xmath44 for odd @xmath19 .",
    "projection of equations with even @xmath19 on the @xmath37 and of equations with odd @xmath19 on the @xmath36 gives identically zero and does not add new equations .",
    "more details about the basis functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given below .",
    "according to the general theory of crm , some of the energy values ( generally complex ) for which system  ( [ fl5 ] ) has a solution are related to the position and width of the resonance state via @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is position of the resonance and @xmath47 its width .",
    "this leads one to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "effectiveness of finding eigenvalues of such a problem depends crucially on the choice of the basis used to represent the matrices in eq.([fl5 ] ) .",
    "the basis set used in the present paper was constructed from the hylleraas type functions : @xmath48 where @xmath49,@xmath50 are some constants ( to be specified below ) , @xmath51,@xmath52,@xmath30 are integers and the angular part @xmath53 represents two angular momenta @xmath54 coupled to a state with a total angular momentum @xmath55 .",
    "the basis functions ( [ hil ] ) must also be properly symmetrized with respect to exchange of the electron coordinates . when choosing parameters in eq .",
    "( [ hil ] ) , we followed the following empirical rules @xcite .",
    "all the basis functions with the parameters satisfying : @xmath56 were included in the calculation .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 determines the overall size of the basis .",
    "there is also a semiempirical rule for choosing angular momenta @xmath58,@xmath59 in the eq.([hil ] ) .",
    "thus , for states of the natural parity @xmath58,@xmath59 are best chosen so that @xmath60 .",
    "both these criteria help to avoid the numerical problems due to near - degeneracy of the basis set when its dimension becomes large .",
    "in the present work , our main goal is to obtain accurate photoionization cross - sections from the ground state of neutral helium for not very large electromagnetic field intensities .",
    "accordingly , our main interest is focused on the states of @xmath61 and @xmath62 symmetries .",
    "therefore , our first goal is to choose such a basis that solution of the eigenvalue problem ( [ fl5 ] ) yields accurate energies for the ground @xmath63 and first excited @xmath64 state of the helium atom in the absence of the field .",
    "this goal was achieved as follows .",
    "we chose parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 for the @xmath61-states and @xmath67 , @xmath68 for the @xmath62-states .",
    "the reason for enlarging the basis set for the excited @xmath62-states is that the electrons in such states are generally on different distances from the nucleus .",
    "this choice combined with restriction on angular momenta ( [ max ] ) resulted in @xmath69 basis functions for the @xmath61-states and @xmath70 basis functions for the @xmath62-states .",
    "the next step was to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for the field - free case . in eq .",
    "( [ fl5 ] ) we put @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and limited ourselves to the blocks with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the @xmath73 block being composed of the states of @xmath35 symmetry , and @xmath74 blocks composed of the states of @xmath64 symmetry . all the numerical results reported below",
    "were obtained using the quadruple precision arithmetics .",
    "we note , that in the presence of the weak electromagnetic field account of the blocks with @xmath74 corresponds to absorption and emission of one photon .",
    "we shall use this fact below to extract the photoionization cross - section from our calculation . for the moment",
    ", we are concerned with testing the accuracy of our basis .",
    "diagonalization of the eigenvalue problem ( [ fl5 ] ) with @xmath71 , @xmath72 in the basis described above produced the following results for the complex energies : @xmath75 ( the ground state ) and @xmath76 @xmath77 state ) .",
    "a small imaginary part which , in the absence of the field , should be zero could be taken as an indication of an accuracy of our basis set .",
    "either this criteria or a direct comparison with the well - known results of highly accurate calculations @xcite shows that we have achieved an accuracy of the order of @xmath78 a.u .",
    "this accuracy , as will be demonstrated below , is sufficient to obtain the photoionization cross - sections with at least three significant figures .      to calculate the total photoionization cross sections we adopted the following strategy .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ fl5 ] ) was solved with the floquet blocks @xmath79 retained , the composition of each block was the same as described above for the field - free case .",
    "diagonalization of the eigenvalue problem ( [ fl5 ] ) produced energy shift and total width for the ground state . by definition , the photoionization cross - section from this state is related to the total width @xmath47 via @xmath80 where @xmath81 is field strength , @xmath82 its frequency , @xmath83 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we need therefore to extract from our calculation the coefficient with @xmath84 in the asymptotic law defining the weak - field behavior of the width : @xmath85 to implement this strategy , we need an extrapolation procedure since the calculation based on the system ( [ fl5 ] ) is performed for a non - zero field strength .",
    "although finite , this field strength should not be too small to compute @xmath47 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the issue of accuracy can be addressed as usual in variational - type calculations , by merely increasing the basis size and verifying that the results do not change appreciably .",
    "such a test was performed for a photon energy @xmath86 ev and a field strength @xmath87 a.u . by varying the parameter @xmath57 in eq.([max ] ) for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 states .",
    "the diagonalization of the problem ( [ fl5 ] ) was performed with the floquet blocks @xmath79 retained .",
    "all the remaining details of the basis ( nonlinear parameters etc . ) were the same as in the field - free case reported above .",
    "the calculation was performed for the value of the rotation angle @xmath88 .",
    ".[tabm1 ] results for the ground state eigenvalue of problem ( [ fl5 ] ) as functions of parameters @xmath57 in eq.([max ] ) , @xmath86 ev , @xmath87 a.u . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparison of the results given in table [ taben ] supports the assertion we made in the previous section as to the accuracy of our results for the widths .",
    "as one can see , for the field strengths @xmath89 a.u .",
    ", inclusion of the additional floquet blocks and basis states of symmetries other than @xmath61 and @xmath62 produces relative variations in the widths on the order of @xmath90 percent .",
    "this means that for such field values we are still within the domain of the validity of the perturbation expansion . for the frequencies presented in the table",
    "the domain of the perturbation theory actually extends quite far in the region of large field strengths .",
    "as one can see from the table ( [ taben ] ) , the ratio @xmath91 starts changing in a more or less appreciable manner only for field strengths as large as @xmath92 a.u .",
    "we performed a calculation of the total photoionization cross - sections from the ground state of helium .",
    "we employed a theoretical procedure based on the floquet - fourie representation of the solutions of the tdse describing the helium atom in the presence of the linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic field .",
    "the resulting set of floquet equations was cast into a generalized eigenvalue problem by the complex rotation method .",
    "our approach is essentially non - perturbative .",
    "this is in contrast with other works @xcite where the crm was used to produce an accurate description of the field - free helium atom , thus giving the ground for application of the perturbation theory . in our approach",
    ", we do not rely on any perturbation expansion to describe interaction of the atom and the electromagnetic field .",
    "this interaction is included into the theory from the beginning .",
    "we would like to emphasize the accuracy of the present results for the photoionization cross - sections which , we believe , is on the level of a fraction of a percent .",
    "although only few selected photon energies were reported in the paper , far wider and denser energy grid was covered by the present calculation .",
    "these results might serve as an accurate database and find their use in various astrophysics and atomic physics applications .",
    "the authors shall gladly communicate these data on request .",
    "the authors acknowledge support of the australian research council in the form of discovery grant dp0451211 ."
