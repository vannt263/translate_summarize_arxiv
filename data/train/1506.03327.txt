    "in heavy ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies , such as those performed at the rhic or the lhc , the bulk of particle production originates from soft gluons that carry a small fraction of the projectile longitudinal momentum  @xcite . because of the infrared singularity present in the emission probability of soft massless gluons , the occupation number of these gluons increases as an inverse power of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath2 , according to the bfkl evolution equation @xcite .",
    "when it reaches values of order @xmath3 , non - linear processes such as recombinations become important and tame the growth of the occupation number  a phenomenon known as gluon saturation @xcite .    by virtue of this large occupation number ,",
    "the dynamics of these soft gluons is essentially classical , but non - perturbative because highly non - linear @xcite . the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective theory @xcite provides an organization principle for this regime of strong interactions , and a calculational framework for computing observables relevant to hadronic or nuclear collisions involving such densely occupied projectiles .    in the study of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the cgc has been applied to calculate the gluon yield at early times @xcite . at leading order ( tree level ) , this amounts to solving the classical yang - mills equations with light - cone currents representing the fast color charges of the two projectiles . at next - to - leading order ( one loop ) @xcite , one can extract the terms that contain logarithms of the collision energy and show that they can be absorbed into the renormalization group evolution according to the jimwlk equation @xcite  of the probability distribution of the above currents .",
    "the cgc framework can also be used in order to study the production of quarks in heavy ion collisions . in this framework , the light - cone color currents couple only to gluons ( because gluons are the dominant constituents of high energy hadrons or nuclei ) , and quarks are produced indirectly from the gluons by the process @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the quark spectrum is one order higher in @xmath0 than the gluon spectrum .",
    "equivalently , one may say that the quark spectrum is a 1-loop quantity while the gluon spectrum is a tree level quantity .",
    "it is well known that the single inclusive quark spectrum can be expressed in terms of a basis of solutions of the dirac equation , with a color background field that corresponds to the lo gluons ( i.e. the classical solution of the yang - mills equations ) .",
    "the choice of this basis of solutions is not unique .",
    "when they are chosen in such a way that they coincide with the free spinors @xmath5 or @xmath6 in the remote past , they are often called _ mode functions _ in the literature , and we will also adopt this terminology in the rest of this paper .    this approach can be used to study the production of fermions or scalar particles in any situation where the production is due to a classical background field @xcite . in the context of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "this formulation has been used first in studies of electron production in nuclear collisions @xcite ( although this is a pure qed process , its treatment in the `` equivalent photon '' approximation is very similar to the cgc ) , and later in a computation of quark production in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this earlier work was limited in a number of ways : ( i ) the basis of mode functions that was used was expressed in terms of proper time and the cartesian coordinates @xmath7 , making the boost invariance of the problem highly non - obvious , ( ii ) the sum over the modes was restricted to a subset of all the possible modes , and ( iii ) the resulting quark spectrum may be contaminated by spurious lattice doublers at high momentum .",
    "the goal of this work is to revisit this study in order to overcome all these limitations . in this first paper",
    ", we first obtain a new basis for the dirac mode functions , that naturally depend on the proper time @xmath8 , on the rapidity @xmath9 and on the transverse position @xmath10 .",
    "these mode functions are indexed by the transverse momentum @xmath11 and a wave number @xmath12 which is the fourier conjugate to @xmath9 , making them very convenient for a lattice implementation where the grid covers a fixed range in @xmath9 .",
    "in order to improve the sampling of the mode functions , we use spinors that are random linear superpositions of all the possible mode functions .",
    "a proper choice of the distribution of the random weights ensures that the exact result is recovered in the limit of infinite statistics . with finite statistics",
    ", this procedure provides a straightforward way to estimate the statistical errors .",
    "numerical results based on a lattice implementation of this framework will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the contents of the paper is the following  : in the section [ sec : cgc ] , we briefly remind the reader of the color glass condensate and of the expression of the quark spectrum in this framework .",
    "we also show in this section how to choose a basis of mode function that makes boost invariance manifest . in the section [ sec : stat ]",
    ", we present a statistical method to sample the modes , and derive the formula for the corresponding statistical errors .",
    "the initial value of the mode functions on the forward light - cone ( i.e. just after the collision of the two nuclei ) is derived in the section [ sec : mode ] .",
    "the section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "a few appendices collect more technical material .",
    "the derivation of the expression of the quark inclusive spectrum in terms of dirac mode functions is recalled in the appendix [ sec : spectrum ] , and an alternate derivation following more closely standard feynman perturbation theory is presented in the appendix [ sec : spectrum - f ] .",
    "the appendix [ app : ic ] discusses a technicality in the derivation of the initial value of the mode functions , and the appendix [ app : inner ] is devoted to the study of a conserved inner product between the mode functions .",
    "we make an extensive use of this inner product in order to properly normalize the mode functions , and as a consistency check at various stages of the calculation . in the section [ sec : abelian ] ,",
    "we use the qed version of the mode functions derived in the section [ sec : mode ] in order to recover the electron production amplitude in the collision of two electrical charges .",
    "the color glass condensate framework is an effective theory that can be used to study the early stages of heavy ion collisions , summarized by the following lagrangian density , @xmath13 written here for one family of quarks of mass @xmath14 .",
    "the color charge content of the incoming nuclei is described by the two currents @xmath15 , whose supports are restricted to the light - cones , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in a collision at very high energy .",
    "these currents fluctuate event - by - event , with a gaussian probability distribution in the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite that we use in this paper .",
    "if one is interested in the production of quarks in a given collision , one could draw randomly one configuration of @xmath15 , and not perform an average over these currents , loop corrections to observables contain unphysical logarithms of the longitudinal momentum cutoff that separate the gluon modes that are described by the sources @xmath18 and those that are described as gauge fields . these logarithms can be absorbed into a redefinition of the probability distribution @xmath19 $ ] of these sources ( that must now evolve according to the jimwlk equation ) .",
    "but this procedure only works if one performs an average over the sources . ] .    in the gluon saturation regime ,",
    "the currents @xmath20 are inversely proportional to the gauge coupling , @xmath21 for this reason , gluonic observables at leading order are expressible in terms of a classical color field that obeys the yang - mills equation with the source @xmath22 , @xmath23=j_1^\\mu+j_2^\\mu\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : ym}\\ ] ] one should in principle also impose the covariant conservation of the current @xmath24=0 $ ] .",
    "this constraint becomes trivial in the fock - schwinger gauge , @xmath25 , since it ensures that the gauge potential vanishes on the support of the current .",
    "we adopt this gauge in the following .",
    "furthermore , for inclusive observables , one can prove that this equation of motion must be supplemented by a retarded boundary condition @xcite , such that the gauge field vanishes in the remote past , thereby making this classical solution unique . in the saturation regime , this classical gauge field is strong , of order @xmath26 .      in the cgc framework",
    ", the fermions do not couple directly to the currents @xmath15 , but only indirectly through the gauge field that appears in the covariant derivative in the dirac operator @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the natural order of magnitude of the spinors is @xmath28 , in accordance with the fact that the occupation number of fermions is bounded by unity .",
    "thus , observables that contain quark fields are of higher order in the gauge coupling .",
    "for instance , the @xmath29 power counting for the quark spectrum at lo is the same as that of the gluon spectrum at nlo : both are 1-loop quantities , the only difference being the nature of the field running in the loop ( quark versus gluon ) . in a fixed background color field ,",
    "the quark spectrum at lo is given by the following formula and @xmath30 .",
    "if one expands it to lowest order in these currents ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , one recovers the standard result for the process @xmath32 with off - shell incoming gluons , derived in the framework of @xmath33-factorization in refs .",
