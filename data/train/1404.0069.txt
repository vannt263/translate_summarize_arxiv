    "the theoretical study of high critical temperature iron - based superconductors@xcite was initially centered on the concept of fermi surface ( fs ) nesting , within a framework that assumes a weak on - site hubbard @xmath0 coupling strength .",
    "however , a variety of recent experiments have indicated that there are serious deviations from this simplistic scenario.@xcite for example , robust local moments have been found at room temperature@xcite that are incompatible with a weak coupling perspective where both the local moments and long - range magnetic order should develop simultaneously upon cooling .",
    "the existence of nematic states@xcite and orbital - independent superconducting gaps@xcite are other experimental observations that can not be rationalized merely by fs nesting . at present",
    ", from the results of several experiments and calculations there is a convergence to the notion that these materials are in an `` intermediate '' coupling regime with regards to the strength of the hubbard @xmath0 interaction.@xcite this coupling regime certainly represents a challenge to theorists because standard many - body techniques are not sufficiently developed to study with accuracy the difficult intermediate @xmath0 regime . in addition , the nature of the problem requires using complex multiorbital hubbard models that are considerably more difficult to study than the simpler one - orbital models used for cuprates .    adding to the complexity that emerges from these recent investigations is the discovery of insulating states in alkali metal iron selenides , with a chemical composition very close to those of superconducting samples.@xcite in particular , a novel magnetic state of the iron superconductors was reported for the intercalated iron selenide k@xmath7fe@xmath8se@xmath3 , with iron vacancies in a @xmath9 arrangement .",
    "neutron scattering studies@xcite of this ( insulating ) compound revealed an unusual spin arrangement involving 2@xmath102 iron blocks with their four spins ferromagnetically ordered , supplemented by an in - plane antiferromagnetic coupling of these 2@xmath102 magnetic blocks .",
    "k@xmath7fe@xmath8se@xmath3 also has a large ordering temperature and large individual magnetic moments @xmath113.3  @xmath12/fe .",
    "note that phase separation tendencies have also been reported in this type of materials,@xcite and for this reason the relation between the exotic magnetic order involving ferromagnetic blocks described above and superconductivity is also a matter of intense discussion .",
    "these developments suggest that new insights into iron pnictides and chalcogenides could be developed if the iron spins are arranged differently than in the nearly square geometry of the fese layers . for this reason",
    "considerable interest was generated by recent studies@xcite of bafe@xmath3se@xmath13 ( 123 ) that contains substructures with the geometry of two - leg ladders , similarly as those widely discussed before in the context of cu - based superconductors.@xcite neutron diffraction studies of the 123-ladder at low temperature  @xcite reported a magnetic order involving blocks of four iron atoms with their moments aligned , coupled antiferromagnetically along the `` leg '' ladder direction .",
    "this `` block - afm '' state is similar to that discussed before for k@xmath7fe@xmath8se@xmath3 , with the iron vacancies .",
    "when the 123-ladder material is hole doped with k , the magnetic state evolves from the block - afm state to a spin state ( called cx ) for the case of kfe@xmath3se@xmath13 with ferromagnetically align spins along the rungs , coupled antiferromagnetically along the legs of the ladders.@xcite adding to the importance of these novel ladder materials , a single layer of alkali - doped fese with the geometry of weakly coupled two - leg ladders was recently reported to be superconducting.@xcite these fe - based ladders provide a simple playground where superconductivity and magnetism can be explored , in a geometry that simplifies the theoretical studies due to its quasi one - dimensionality .    in recent real - space hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations of ladder",
    "models,@xcite the 2@xmath102 block - afm state was indeed found to be stable in a robust region of parameter space , after a random initial magnetic configuration was used as the start of the iterative process to avoid biasing the results .",
    "the other recently observed@xcite cx - state was also found in the theoretical phase diagrams .",
    "several other competing states , that could be stabilized in related compounds via chemical doping or high pressure , were also identified.@xcite the variety of possible magnetic states is remarkable , revealing an unexpected level of complexity in these systems .",
    "a technical aspect important for our purposes is that the study in ref .   showed that the use of the hf technique , which is a crude approximation particularly in a low - dimensional geometry , did capture the essence of the magnetic order in ladders at least when compared with density matrix renormalization group calculations .",
    "this previous agreement allow us to be confident that a hf study in one dimension , as presented below , may still capture the dominant correlations at short distances in the phase diagrams .",
    "in addition to the bafe@xmath3se@xmath13 compound already mentioned , there is another group of fe - selenide materials that also display quasi one - dimensional characteristics but in this case simply involving chains as opposed to ladders .",
    "a typical representative is tlfese@xmath3 .",
    "its crystal structure is in fig .",
    "[ figure.structure ] , and it contains dominant substructures in the form of weakly coupled chains.@xcite iron is in a state fe@xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath15 for the electronic population of the @xmath16 fe orbitals ( @xmath17 is the average number of electrons in the @xmath16 shell of the iron atoms ) .",
    "tlfese@xmath3 is believed to be antiferromagnetic , based on magnetic susceptibility and transport measurements , with a characteristic temperature @xmath18  k where short - range order along the chains develops,@xcite followed upon cooling by the stabilization of three - dimensional long - range order at a lower temperature @xmath19  k. as a consequence , over a wide temperature range the material behaves as nearly - independent quasi - one dimensional chains .",
    "there are other compounds with similar structures,@xcite such as tlfes@xmath3 and kfese@xmath3 . in particular",
    ", tlfes@xmath3 has been studied with neutron diffraction and it is also believed to be antiferromagnetic at low temperatures.@xcite in spite of all this progress , the microscopic details of the spin order arrangements are unknown .",
    "it is interesting to recall that in the context of the cu - based superconductors the study of materials that contain dominant one - dimensional chain substructures , such as srcuo@xmath3  @xcite and sr@xmath3cuo@xmath13,@xcite as well as the already mentioned two - leg ladders,@xcite led to considerable advances in the understanding of cuprates .",
    "for all these reasons , in the present effort the theoretical study of the magnetic states of models for one - dimensional iron - based superconductors will be initiated .",
    "our aim is to present a hf comprehensive study of multiorbital hubbard models in one dimension to predict qualitatively the dominant magnetic states in this context , thus guiding future neutron scattering experiments . the previously discussed success in the use of the hf approximation when applied to ladders",
    "give us confidence that at least qualitatively this crude approximation may still reveal the dominant magnetic tendencies in one - dimensional systems .",
    "of course , it is important to realize that long - range order in the hf sense may in practice only correspond to dominant power - law behavior in a particular ordering channel for the one - dimensional systems of interest here , or merely short - range order tendencies .",
    "the electronic density @xmath15 of relevance for tlfese@xmath3 will be studied here , but other electronic densities , such as @xmath20 which is of relevance in two - dimensional pnictides , will also be analyzed .",
    "this extension in the range of @xmath17 is in anticipation of the possible synthesis of novel one - dimensional materials with other values of @xmath17 in the future . in general terms , our overarching goal is to motivate further experimental and theoretical efforts in the study of one - dimensional iron - based materials since their theoretical analysis is simpler than in two dimensions and considerable insight on these exotic compounds can be gained by their detailed study and subsequent comparison with experiments .    the organization of the manuscript and our main results are the following . in sec .",
    "ii , details of the density functional theory calculation are described , together with the five - orbital hubbard model and the many - body technique employed .",
    "section  iii contains the phase diagrams at both densities @xmath15 and @xmath21 , in one and in anisotropic two dimensions .",
    "section  iv contains the density of states and orbital composition .",
    "finally , the conclusions are provided in sec .  v. the details of the hopping amplitudes",
    "are provided in the appendix .",
    "the theoretical work presented in this section consists of two parts .",
    "first , using @xmath22-@xmath23 techniques the band structure of tlfese@xmath3 was calculated , and tight - binding hopping amplitudes were deduced .",
    "second , using the band structure information , hubbard models involving the five @xmath16 orbitals of fe were constructed and studied with hf approximations . the detail is the following :      the electron fe - fe hopping amplitudes corresponding to the five fe  @xmath16 orbitals in tlfese@xmath3 were calculated using two independent density functional theory ( dft ) approximations . in the first one , the all - electron linearized augmented plane wave method , as implemented in wien2k  @xcite with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof approximation for the exchange - correlation functional,@xcite was employed to obtain the electronic structure of tlfese@xmath3 , which was subsequently projected onto a wannier functions basis.@xcite the second calculation has been carried out in the frame of the local spin density approximation with the perdew and zunger ( pz ) exchange - correlation functional,@xcite using the plane wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the pwscf code of the quantum espresso ( qe ) distribution.@xcite the ultrasoft pseudo - potential@xcite optimized in the rrkj scheme@xcite was used ( se.pz-n-rrkjus.upf , fe.pz-spn-rrkjus.upf from the qe pseudopotentials database were employed , while the pb.pz-dn-rrkjus.upf pseudopotential was used as a prototype for the tl pseudopotential ) .",
    "furthermore , the result was used to calculate maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite as it is implemented in the wannier90 distribution.@xcite since the difference between hopping amplitudes obtained by these two methods does not exceed a few percent , for simplicity below only the wien2k results will be used .",
    "the dft calculations presented here are based on the crystal structure refined by klepp and boller.@xcite tlfese@xmath3 belongs to the @xmath24 space group with a monoclinic centered unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ figure.structure ] ) .",
    "the edge - sharing fese@xmath25-tetrahedra form layers of parallel chains with slightly alternating nearest - neighbor fe - fe bond distances in the @xmath26-plane of the primitive unit cell , separated by tl atoms ; each primitive unit cell contains two formula units .    according to the dft calculations",
    ", the fe and se states are strongly hybridized , with the fe  @xmath16 character prevailing between -1.8 and 1.5  ev ( fermi level is at 0  ev ) .",
    "this energy range was used to construct the projected fe  @xmath16 wannier functions and calculate the corresponding hopping integrals .",
    "the final tight - binding ( tb ) model , used in our model calculations , includes all hoppings between the fe pairs in the plane of fe chains within the separation range of 8.24   .",
    "after the model is constructed , different electronic densities will simply be reached by changing a chemical potential .",
    "the dft - calculated values of some of the hopping amplitudes are in the appendix .",
    "as expected , the nearest - neighbor hoppings along the fe - chains are dominant , with the largest absolute value being approximately 0.43  ev . however , in order to reproduce accurately the fine details of the band structure it is necessary to consider quite a number of longer - ranged hoppings in other directions as well .",
    "thus , a judicious truncation of the hopping range ( details presented below ) must be carried out to render practical the hf approximation described below .",
    "a multi - orbital hubbard model will be employed in this study , based exclusively on the fe @xmath16 electrons .",
    "our emphasis will be on the magnetic states obtained by varying the coupling parameters .",
    "this hubbard model includes all five fe @xmath16 orbitals @xmath27 , which are widely believed to be the most relevant orbitals at the fermi surface for the iron - based superconductors , in agreement also with the band structure calculations of the previous subsection .    in real space",
    ", this multi - orbital hubbard model includes a tight - binding term defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 creates an electron with spin @xmath30 in the orbital @xmath31 at site @xmath32 , and @xmath33 refers to the tunneling amplitude of electron hoppings from orbital @xmath31 at site @xmath32 to orbital @xmath34 at site @xmath35 .",
    "the coulombic interacting portion of the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote the fe @xmath16 orbitals , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the spin ( electronic density ) of orbital @xmath31 at site @xmath40 ( this index labels sites of the square lattice defined by the irons ) , and the standard relation @xmath41 between the kanamori parameters has been used .",
    "the first two terms give the energy cost of having two electrons located in the same orbital or in different orbitals , both at the same site , respectively .",
    "the second line contains the hund s rule coupling that favors the ferromagnetic ( fm ) alignment of the spins in different orbitals at the same lattice site .",
    "the `` pair - hopping '' term is in the third line and its coupling is equal to @xmath1 by symmetry .    in this effort , the hartree - fock approximation will be applied to the coulombic interaction , restricted to act only `` on site '' , to investigate the ground state properties .",
    "this hf approximation results in a hf hamiltonian containing several unknown hf expectation values ( due to the many combinations of orbitals that can be made ) .",
    "all these expectation values need to be optimized by a self - consistent iterative numerical process .",
    "the expectation values are assumed independent from site to site in the numerical procedure , allowing the system to select spontaneously the state that minimizes the hf energy , thus reducing the bias into the calculations . to start the self - consistent iteration process , first all the hf expectation values",
    "are set to some randomly chosen numbers , defining a random initial state .",
    "these random - start process tends to be time consuming and at the end of the iterations states are obtained that typically display close , but not perfect , regularity . by hand , these imperfections are removed and then those regular states are used again as initial states in the hf iterative process where they are further optimized .    at the end of this tedious procedure , the ground states are selected by comparing the final ground energies after convergence . as discussed before ,",
    "the tight - binding hopping amplitudes are obtained from the dft calculation . however , for comparison purposes results using the hoppings from ref .  , which were deduced in a quite different context ,",
    "will be used as well to judge how robust our hf results phase diagrams are .",
    "our conclusions are that the essence of the phase diagrams do not depend much on the details of the hoppings .    the hf calculations reported here are carried out using three different lattices : ( 1 ) our most important results are obtained on @xmath42 clusters , namely on one - dimensional single chains .",

    "( 2 ) also @xmath50 one - dimensional single chains were used but employing the hopping amplitudes from ref .  .",
    "the ratio of hopping amplitudes at maximum and minimum distances is about @xmath51 in this case as well .",
    "( 3 ) to develop at least a qualitative idea of the magnetic coupling between the one - dimensional dominant structures , @xmath52 two - dimensional square lattices were also studied .",
    "all the hopping amplitudes presented in the appendix were employed in this case .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are used here for all the calculations . in the self - consistent iterative process , the criteria of convergence is set so that the changes of the hf expectation values are less than @xmath53 . under this criteria , the typical number of iterations can be as large as @xmath54 for the two - dimensional calculations and as large as @xmath55 for the one - dimensional calculations , particularly for the case of random starting configurations .",
    "let us start our description of the main results with the case of electronic density @xmath15 , corresponding to tlfese@xmath3 , and using first a one - dimensional system containing 32 sites , and employing the real - space hf technique described in the previous section .",
    "increasing the hubbard coupling @xmath0 to move beyond the paramagnetic regime and for all the hund couplings @xmath1 analyzed here , there is only one magnetic state in the entire phase diagram , namely the staggered @xmath56 state denoted as af1 in fig .",

    "the average electronic population of the @xmath16 orbitals of mn is @xmath61 , different from the @xmath20 of fe , but the crystal structures are similar as in layered iron pnictides .",

    "perhaps due to limitations in the cluster size studied in this effort , other possible states are not present in the phase diagram , but it is possible that the size of the individual fm clusters does not stop at just 4 but a cascade of block states with increasing cluster sizes could also be stabilized ( in increasingly narrower regions of parameter space ) in the transition from afm to fm states .",
    "overall , it appears that neither fully fm nor fully staggered afm states are stabilized , but instead the phase diagram is dominated by intermediate magnetic states such as the c - type afm and the fm blocks coupled afm in both directions .",

    "although the magnetic state cx that dominates the phase diagram is not spin staggered in all directions , the chains are certainly dominating since the hoppings are the largest along the direction they define .",
