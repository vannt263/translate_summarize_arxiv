    "many kinds of eruptive phenomena , such as flares , filament eruptions and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , can be seen in the solar atmosphere .",
    "eruptive flares and cmes are often observed with filament eruptions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely believed that these eruptive phenomena are triggered by the same global magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) process by which free magnetic energy stored in the coronal magnetic field is released as a form of thermal and/or kinetic energy .",
    "many models and theories about the triggers have been proposed from both observational and theoretical studies @xcite , however , the exact mechanism by which eruptions occur is still under debates .",
    "the interaction between newly emerging flux and coronal magnetic fields is one candidate .",
    "many observational studies report that newly emerging flux exists near the filament channel before the occurrence of a filament eruption ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found in a statistical study that quiescent filament eruptions tended to occur when the polarity of newly emerging flux and the magnetic field of a filament channel were favorable for reconnection .",
    "the observational statistical study of confirmed the results of @xcite and found that the location of emerging flux relative to the filament channel strongly affected the occurrence of eruptions .",
    "@xcite performed a theoretical study by two - dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "they used the quadrupole magnetic structure , which consisted of a detached flux rope and an overlying magnetic arcade as an initial condition , and modeled emerging flux by changing the magnetic field at the bottom boundary . as a result ,",
    "the system entered a non - equilibrium state and the flux rope was driven upward by the reconnection beneath it .",
    "@xcite analytically investigated the detailed conditions for the eruptions by interaction between the emerging flux and the pre - existing coronal magnetic field which contains a flux rope . though the analytic solutions of the equilibrium curves allow us to know whether the conditions are eruptive or not , the nature of eruptions in some cases are not clear . in order to get the physical understanding and to validate the eruptive conditions , numerical simulations must be performed .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a theoretical model of a filament eruption associated with emerging flux by using three - dimensional mhd simulations with gravity . a flux tube buried in the convection zone entered the corona by magnetic buoyancy in a self - consistent manner",
    "the emerging flux deformed the arcade field , which caused reconnection , and resulted in the formation and eruption of a flux rope .",
    "@xcite showed that emerging flux introduced into the pil can destabilize sheared magnetic arcade fields in the corona and cause plasma eruptions through the use of three - dimensional zero-@xmath0 mhd simulations .",
    "one of the differences between @xcite and @xcite was the location of emerging flux ; it was apart from the pil in the former , while it was on the pil in the latter .",
    "in this paper we aim to determine the conditions under which eruptions occur due to the interaction between newly emerging flux and coronal arcade fields and express them by using observable variables such as the magnetic flux , the location of flux emergence and the shear angle of coronal arcade fields . for this purpose , we perform mhd simulations , based on a model similar to that of @xcite . the parameters varied in our study are the magnetic scale height which relates to the shear angle of the arcade field , the magnetic field strength and the location of the emerging flux .",
    "we show the simulation model in  2 and the results in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the results drawn from the simulations , and compare them with those of other observational and theoretical studies .",
    "we solve nonlinear , time - dependent , resistive , compressible mhd equations in a rectangular computational box .",
    "the simulations are 2.5-dimensional , i.e. , all three components in velocity and magnetic fields are taken into account in a two - dimensional @xmath1-domain .",
    "the gas is assumed to be ideal with the ratio of specific heats @xmath2 .",
    "thermal conduction , radiative cooling and viscosity are absent in our simulations .",
    "the equations are @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5-\\rho { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ g$}}\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}=0,\\ ] ] @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a unit tensor , @xmath10 is the magnetic diffusion rate , @xmath11 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath12 is constant .",
    "temperature is derived from the equation of state : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean molecular mass ( @xmath15 is assumed where @xmath16 is the proton mass ) , and @xmath17 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "the normalized units of length , velocity , and density are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively , where the subscript ` pho ' means the typical value in the photosphere , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are scale height and speed of sound , respectively .",
    "the other normalized units are combinations of these units : time is @xmath23 , temperature is @xmath24 , magnetic field is @xmath25 , and gravitational acceleration is @xmath26 .",
    "we use anomalous resistivity ( e.g. @xcite ) to trigger a petschek - type reconnection : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is drift velocity , @xmath29 is elementary charge , and the normalized values of the parameters are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . we restrict the value of @xmath10 to @xmath32 .      the initial condition is the modeling of the solar atmosphere from the convection zone to the corona .",
    "we follow the manner of modeling in the previous simulation studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fig.[init ] shows the initial vertical distribution of temperature , density , gas pressure , and magnetic pressure .",
    "the background gas consists of four layers :    t(y)= t_- ( d|| _ ) y ,  ( yy _ ) + t _ ,  ( y_y y _ ) + t_+ ( t_-t _ ) ,  ( y_y y _ ) + t _ ,  ( y _ y )    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    "because @xmath39 is chosen to be 1.015 , the vertical gradient of temperature is slightly larger than the adiabatic temperature gradient , causing the magnetic buoyancy instability to the flux tube .",

    ", we refer to the right arcade toward the flux tube in the initial condition as ` counter - arranged arcade ' because the polarity arrangement is in reverse order , and the left arcade as ` co - arranged arcade ' because the polarity arrangement is in the same order as emerging flux ( fig.[arc ] ) .",

    "for the parameter survey , we performed the multiple simulations among which the field strength @xmath48 , the location of the emerging flux @xmath50 and the magnetic scale height of the arcade field @xmath57 varies .",

    "the plasmoids are formed and erupted by the interaction between the emerging flux and the arcade fields .",
    "we found that two types of eruptive mechanisms exist . before showing the results of the parameter survey ,",
    "the typical examples of each eruptive mechanism are shown in the next subsection .",
    "our simulations suggest two mechanisms for the formation and eruption of plasmoids : one is due to compression of the arcade field by the emerging flux ( hereafter ` ca - type ' mechanism ) , and the other is due to reconnection coupling as a consequence of multipoint reconnections between the arcade field and the emerging flux ( hereafter ` rc - type ' mechanism ) .",
    "the ca type eruptions can be seen when the location of the emerging flux is around @xmath79 ( separator line dividing the counter - arranged arcade and the co - arranged arcade ) .",
    "the rc type eruptions can be seen when the location of the emerging flux is around @xmath75 ( the pil of the counter - arranged arcade ) . in both mechanisms ,",
    "the plasmoid is accelerated by reconnection outflow . in spite of the distinct mechanisms , both the ca - type and the rc - type eruptions succeed in creating a hot cusp structure ( @xcite ) , as proposed in the standard cshkp model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fig.[mecha1 ] shows a time evolution of the ca - type mechanism in the case of @xmath80 .",
    "the flux tube initially buried in the convection zone expands rapidly after entering the corona ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the compression of the arcades by the expanding emerging flux makes the current inside the arcades larger and thinner ( @xmath82 ) . as a result",
    ", reconnections occur inside both the counter - arranged and co - arranged arcades above each pil around @xmath83 , leading to the formation of plasmoids .",
    "both the plasmoids are initially accelerated by reconnection outflow ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the plasmoid originating from the counter - arranged arcade continues to rise up even after reconnection stops ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , the plasmoid originating from the co - arranged arcade is pulled by a downward magnetic tension force from the overlying arcade field , resulting in the confined eruption .",
    "since the field lines of the emerging flux and those of the co - arranged arcade are antiparallel , the reconnection is triggered in the same manner as the standard jet model @xcite .",
    "this reconnection transfers the magnetic flux from the right footpoints of the co - arranged arcade to the right side of the emerging flux , forming the large overlying arcade ( see also fig.[ca_mecha ] ) .",
    "even though the plasmoid is formed in the same manner as the counter - arranged arcade case , the downward tension force of the overlying arcade prevents the plasmoid from going upward .",
    "consequently , the plasmoid turns to fall down after the temporal upward motion .",
    "fig.[unformed ] shows a time evolution of @xmath86 .",
    "this case is categorized to the unformed case .",
    "compared with the erupted case such as @xmath80 , the compression of the arcade is not sufficient to trigger the reconnection inside the arcades because the field strength of the emerging flux is small and its expansion in the corona is weaker .",
    "although weak reconnection is triggered between the co - arranged arcade and the emerging flux as well ( @xmath87 ) , the system rather evolves into a quasi - static state ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "fig.[mecha2 ] shows a time evolution of the rc - type mechanism in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "compared with the two cases shown above , the emerging flux is located at the pil of the counter - arranged arcade field .",
    "in contrast to the ca - type , since the location of @xmath50 is at the pil , the emerging flux does not lead to a sideways compression of the arcade field and the formation of a vertical current sheet . in this case , a current sheet is formed at the interface between the emerging flux and the arcade field as these oppositely directed fields are pushing against each other ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the reconnections are triggered at multiple points in this sheet almost simultaneously , and a plasmoid grows ( @xmath85 ) . in the end ,",
    "two reconnections play an important role for the eruptions .",
    "the hot outflow from a right - side reconnection point , which is slightly more intense compared with that from the left - side reconnection point , passes through the boundary region between the arcade and the emerging flux , and links to the inflow region of the left - side reconnection point ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the left - side reconnection is driven by the outflow from the right - side reconnection point , leading to a plasmoid eruption ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "fig.[mecha2_bh ] is the extended view of the reconnection coupling .",
    "the outflow from one reconnection point at @xmath92 reaches the other x - point at @xmath93 and promotes the reconnection there , leading to the growth and eruption of a plasmoid .",
    "reconnection points in the current sheet appear in random positions as a result of a resistive instability in which the seed perturbations are imposed by numerical noises .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the breakout model @xcite with respect that the reconnection between the overlying arcade field and the expanding magnetic flux ( which corresponds to the emerging flux in our simulations ) triggers the eruption .",
    "the critical difference is the number of the reconnection points .",
    "the breakout model has one reconnection point ( null point ) on the top of the expanding flux , while the rc - type mechanism has two reconnection points in the current sheet between the arcade field and the emerging ( expanding ) flux .",
    "this difference leads to the distinct eruptive process . in the breakout model ,",
    "the expanding flux itself erupts , while , in the rc - type mechanism , the plasmoid formed by the two reconnections in the current sheet finally erupts .",
    "note that when the flux emergence is located at the pil of the co - arranged arcade ( @xmath74 ) , the reconnection between the emerging flux and the co - arranged arcade does not occur because they have the same direction of the field lines .",
    "the emerging flux just expands the arcade , and ends up with a quasi - static state .",
    "the result of each run is categorized to ` erupted case ' , ` formed case ' or ` unformed case ' . in the erupted cases ,",
    "the formed plasmoids continuously go upward for the simulation time . in the formed cases , the formed plasmoids turn to descend or stop after temporal ascending .",
    "the formed cases include the confined eruptions .",
    "the unformed cases do not show the formation of any plasmoids .",
    "the results of our parameter survey with respect to @xmath48 and @xmath50 are shown in fig.[resr ] .",
    "the magnetic scale height of the arcade field is fixed to be @xmath94 .",
    "the filled circles represent erupted cases , the triangles represent the formed cases , and the crosses represent the unformed cases .",
    "ca - type eruptions occur when the field strength of the emerging flux is sufficiently large , and its location is closer to the boundary between neighboring arcades",
    ". however , when the flux emergence is too close to the pil of an arcade , ca - type eruptions do not occur .",
    "rc - type eruptions occur only when the location of the emerging flux is at the pil of the counter - arranged arcade , and when the field strength is sufficiently small .",
    "there are several cases in which plasmoids form in both arcades , however , in none of them both plasmoids erupt ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "fig.[resa ] shows the results of the parameter survey with respect to the magnetic scale height @xmath57 .",
    "the cases of @xmath95 and @xmath96 are investigated as the typical cases of the ca - type eruptions and the rc - type eruptions , respectively .",
    "both the ca - type eruptions and the rc - type eruptions are more likely to occur when @xmath57 is larger , i.e. , when the shear angle of the arcade is larger .      fig.[height ] ( a ) shows the time evolution of height , and fig.[height ] ( b ) shows the mean ejection speed of the plasmoid in each eruptive and confined case . the temporal ascent and subsequent descent of the plasmoid from the co - arranged arcade in the cases of @xmath97 and that from the counter - arranged arcade in the case of @xmath98 are regarded as the confined eruptions",
    "the mean ejection speed of each plasmoid is calculated from the inclination of the time - height curves .",
    "because the confined eruptions have not only the ascending phase but also the subsequent descending phase of plasmoid , we use the time - height curve only during the ascending phase for the computation of the mean ejection speed .",
    "when the field strength of the emerging flux is large , the mean ejection speed is high .",
    "the dependence on @xmath99 is relatively small .",
    "this means that the kinetic energy of the plasmoid comes from the magnetic energy of the emerging flux , i.e. , it is stored in the corona through the deformation of the coronal arcade field by the emerging flux and the reconnection releases the stored magnetic energy as kinetic energy of the plasmoid .    the mean ejection speed of the confined eruptions ( the open symbols in fig.[height ] ( b ) ) is smaller than those of full eruptions in the same situations .",
    "this is due to the downward magnetic tension force of overlying arcade field lines , which is formed by the reconnection between the co - arranged arcade and the emerging flux ( see also fig.[ca_mecha ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the reasons why the results of the parameter survey show the tendencies in figs.[resr ] and [ resa ] and attempt to outline the eruptive conditions of each mechanism .",
    "when the flux tube emerges around the edges of the arcade fields , the expanding emerging flux compresses the arcade fields , which generates a vertical current sheet above the pils .",
    "if the current exceeds a certain threshold , reconnection occurs , resulting in the formation and eruption of a plasmoid .",
    "therefore , deriving the eruptive conditions requires the evaluation of the current density inside the compressed arcade field , of the extent to which the emerging flux compresses the arcade field , and of the threshold of the current to trigger the reconnection .",
    "though our simulation set - up include the multiple arcades compressed by the emerging flux , we discuss the eruptive condition by using the system which has one arcade and one emerging flux tube in order to simplify the problem and to get fundamental physical picture .    first , we evaluate the extent to which the emerging flux compresses the arcade field .",
    "this can be estimated by considering the balance of magnetic pressures between the arcade and emerging flux .",
    "fig.[each_force ] ( a ) shows magnetic pressure ( solid line ) , gas pressure ( dashed line ) , and total pressure ( dotted line ) on the white line in the inset corresponding to fig.[unformed ] ( the case of @xmath86 , @xmath100 ) .",
    "fig.[each_force ] ( b ) shows the @xmath101-directional forces of the magnetic pressure gradient , gas pressure gradient , and magnetic tension force .",
    "the region between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , next to the interface between the emerging flux and the arcade , is a high-@xmath0 region .",
    "the high-@xmath0 region is composed of the material fallen from the top of the emerging flux where ` dense sheath ' ( @xcite ) is formed .",
    "as shown in fig.[each_force ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the magnetic pressure gradients of the emerging flux and the arcade field are balanced with the gas pressure gradient of the high-@xmath0 region . according to fig.[each_force ] ( b )",
    ", the magnetic tension force is negligible compared with the other two forces .",
    "therefore , it is possible to regard the magnetic pressures of the emerging flux and the arcade field as being in balance with each other .",
    "next , we postulate the self - similar time evolution of the magnetic fields , assuming that the parameters of the arcade field @xmath104 are changed into @xmath105 after being compressed .",

    "therefore , the obtained model can also qualitatively explain the simulation results regarding the magnetic scale height @xmath57 .    in a three - dimensional case , it is probable that larger values of @xmath148 are required because the radius of expanded emerging flux is smaller than that in a two - dimensional case .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field strength of the emerging flux that caused an eruption in @xcite was twice as large as that in our results .",
    "when the emerging flux is located at the pil , it does not lead to a sideways compression of the arcade and the formation of a vertical current sheet .",
    "hence , ca - type eruptions are not likely to occur . in the case of counter - arranged arcades ,",
    "some plasmoids are formed through reconnections in the long current sheet between the arcade and the emerging flux .",
    "the reconnection coupling , the linkage of outflow of one reconnection to inflow of another reconnection , enables a plasmoid to erupt .",
    "the formation of small plasmoids is always seen in the current sheet between the arcade and the emerging flux . on the other hand , it is not always predictable from our simulations whether the plasmoids will grow to large plasmoids or not .",
    "in addition , when reconnection coupling does not occur , an eruption does not occur , even if there is a continuous growth of a plasmoid .",
    "the tendency seen in the results of the parameter survey ( fig.[resr ] ) indicates that rc - type eruptions occur only when the field strength of the emerging flux @xmath48 is small .",
    "this is because the reconnection coupling is likely to occur when the two reconnection points are close enough to link with each other .",
    "the distance between the two reconnection points depends on the expansion radius of the emerging flux , so that a smaller field strength of emerging flux is preferable . when the location of the emerging flux surrounds the pil of the co - arranged arcade , no current sheet forms between the arcade and emerging flux , resulting in an ` unformed ' case .",
    "rc - type eruptions and ` reversed shear ' ( rs)-type eruptions , as observed in @xcite , occur under similar conditions .",
    "our simulations reveal that the eruptions are likely to occur when the magnetic scale height @xmath57 is large ( fig.[resa ] ) .",
    "@xcite revealed that their rs - type eruptions are triggered when the shear angle of the arcade is large . according to the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath60 in eq.([dtheta ] ) , for constant @xmath59 , larger values of @xmath57 correspond to larger values of @xmath60 , meaning that our parameter dependence on @xmath57 qualitatively agrees with the results in @xcite .",
    "one difference is the formation process of the plasmoids . in rs - type eruptions in @xcite ,",
    "the force that causes the magnetic field lines of arcades to converge , by which reconnection is triggered , is the magnetic pressure gradient . in our simulations ,",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient is immediately balanced with the gas pressure gradient . instead of the pressure gradient ,",
    "the convergence of field lines is enhanced by the coupling of multi - point reconnections in our rc - type eruptions .      formed cases , in which the plasmoid is formed but non - eruptive , are shown with triangles in fig.[resr ] , [ resa ] and [ cocounter ] . in these cases ,",
    "the eruption of a plasmoid that forms in a co - arranged arcade is suppressed by the stabilizing flux of the overlying arcade , which successively increases due to reconnection between the arcade and the emerging flux ( see bottom pannels in fig.[ca_mecha ] ) .",
    "another reason for non - eruption is that the earlier eruption from either the counter- or co - arranged arcade blocks the passage of the later eruption .",
    "this can happen in the cases of ca - type eruptions if the emerging flux is strong enough to trigger reconnection in both arcades .",
    "no eruptions are seen also when the coupling of two reconnection points fails .",
    "this is likely for the plasmoids formed in rc - type condition with strong emerging flux .",
    "even when the plasmoids grow sufficiently , they do not erupt but remain stationary without the reconnection coupling .",
    "the continuous growth of plasmoids in formed cases might lead to eruptions in three - dimensional simulations by the help of the kink or torus instability .",
    "@xcite first showed in their statistical study that eruptions were triggered when the spatial arrangement of pre - existing arcade fields and newly emerging flux was favorable for reconnection . in our results ,",
    "the rc - type eruptions are clearly consistent with their observation . in the case of ca - types",
    ", both favorable and unfavorable reconnection arrangements can cause eruptions .",
    "this is because the most essential point for ca - type eruptions is whether or not the arcade field is compressed enough to cause reconnection .",
    "statistically investigated the triggering mechanism of eruptions caused by emerging flux , especially with respect to the polarity , amount and the location of emerging flux .",
    "they reported that eruptions did not occur when the emerging flux had same polarity orientation as that of the ambient magnetic field and was located too close to or too far from the pil , and when the emerging flux is too weak .",
    "our results are consistent with their findings .",
    "they also showed that eruptions were triggered when the emerging flux had opposite polarity orientation and was located inside the filament channel , or when the emerging flux had same polarity orientation and was located outside the filament channel .",
    "the former case agrees with our rc - type conditions .",
    "the latter case corresponds to our ca - type condition with the co - arranged arcade and does not conflict with our results , while the ca - type eruptions are also triggered from the counter - arranged arcades in our simulations .",
    "@xcite theoretically investigate the condition for the eruptions by interaction between the newly emerging flux and the pre - existing coronal magnetic field which contains a flux rope .",
    "their analysis is based on the loss of equilibrium model .",
    "our results of parameter survey agree with one of their results that the eruptions can occur even when the orientation of the emerging flux and the coronal magnetic field is unfavorable for reconnection .",
    "one difference between theirs and ours lies in the initial coronal magnetic field . in our case , the flux rope ( plasmoid )",
    "is formed after the interaction between the emerging flux and the coronal arcade field . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "the initial coronal magnetic field contains the flux rope .",
    "the other difference is that our simulations solve the flux emergence self - consistently . in the study of @xcite , the parameters of emerging flux such as the field strength and the vertical location are independent with each other .",
    "in addition , the flux rope contained in the initial coronal field also has several independent parameters .",
    "because of these many independent parameters , the conditions for eruptions became complicated . in the present study , because the flux emergence is solved self - consistently and the initial coronal field has simple arcade configuration , the number of the independent parameters are reduced .",
    "this makes the physical nature and the eruptive condition more simple .",
    "our simulations are applicable to the eruptions triggered by flux emergence in so - called pseudostreamers , since two neighboring arcades in our system correspond topologically to the two closed flux lobes at the base of a pseudostreamers . @xcite",
    "modeled the sympathetic eruptions by imposing the shearing flow at the two pils of the pseudostreamer . in their simulations , both the two arcades of pseudostreamer are erupted .",
    "it is common between our ca - type mechanism and their mechanism that the reconnections are triggered inside each arcade , leading to the formation and eruption of the plasmoid .",
    "the difference is that our model does not result in the sympathetic eruptions .",
    "one reason is that the eruptions from the co - arranged arcade tend to be confined by the large overlying arcade , which is formed through the reconnection between the emerging flux and the co - arranged arcade .",
    "the other reason is that the earlier eruption from either the counter - arranged or the co - arranged arcade blocks the path of the later eruption .    in our two - dimensional simulations ,",
    "the effects of the torus and kink instabilities ( , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are absent .",
    "the criteria of the torus instability is @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the external magnetic field strength , @xmath184 is major radius of toroidal flux rope , @xmath185 is decay index . for the two - dimensional case of an infinite long , straight flux rope ,",
    "the criteria of eruptions based on the loss of equilibrium is expressed by the same manner with @xmath186 @xcite . as seen in fig.[resa ] ,",
    "eruptions are likely to occur when the magnetic scale height @xmath57 is larger .",
    "this dependence on @xmath57 will be opposite if the loss of equilibrium or the torus instability is effective .",
    "for the arcade field used in our simulations , the critical condition of the loss of equilibrium of a plasmoid is @xmath187 eq.([ctorus ] ) shows that eruptions are more likely to be triggered when the magnetic scale height @xmath57 is smaller ( note that the situation is same as when the shear angle @xmath60 is smaller ) .",
    "the critical height in our simulations is around @xmath188 . in the all formed cases ( triangles in fig.[resa ] ) , the formed plasmoids exceed the critical height , however , they do not result in full eruptions . in the present two - dimensional simulations",
    ", we can not find the clear evidence for the occurrence of the loss of equilibrium .",
    "it is necessary to confirm the dependence on @xmath57 in three - dimensional simulations .",
    "if the coupling with the instabilities ( not only the torus instability but also the kink instability ) is achieved , the plasmoid will be accelerated more and result in the faster eruptions such as cme .",
    "the mechanisms of eruptions associated with interaction between newly emerging flux and coronal arcade fields were investigated by 2.5-dimensional mhd simulations .",
    "we found that two possible eruptive mechanisms exist for the configuration studied here , and we determined their parametric dependence on the magnetic scale height of the arcade field , the amount of emerging flux , and the location of emerging flux .",
    "the ca - type mechanism , which occurs if emerging flux compresses the field in the lower part of an arcade , is dominant when the location of emerging flux surrounds the edges of arcades .",
    "the condition to trigger the ca - type eruption is represented as formula ( [ econd ] ) , namely , the formation and eruption of a plasmoid occurs when the location of emerging flux is close to the edge of the arcade field and the amount of flux introduced into the corona is large enough .",
    "the eruptions are also more likely to occur when the magnetic scale height is large ( this is the same situation as when the arcade is strongly sheared ) . the rc - type mechanism , which occurs if multiple reconnections occur in the current sheet between the emerging flux and the counter - arranged arcade , is dominant when emerging flux surrounds the pil .",
    "the parameter dependence shows that such eruptions are more likely to occur when a small amount of magnetic flux is introduced and when the arcade is strongly sheared .",
    "the eruptive mechanisms we described here appear to work in fully three - dimensional configurations as well .",
    "for example , the simulation by @xcite suggests the occurrence of a ca - type mechanism , while the eruptive mechanism described in @xcite corresponds to our rc - type cases .",
    "the kink or torus instability can be expected to support both types of eruptions in three - dimensional cases .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for his / her constructive suggestions and tolerant encouragement .",
    "numerical computations were carried out on general - purpose pc farm and cray xc30 at the center for computational astrophysics , cfca , of national astronomical observatory of japan . we have greatly benefited from the proofreading / editing assistance from the gcoe program ."
