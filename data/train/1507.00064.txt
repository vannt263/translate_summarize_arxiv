    "heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds have provided some of the clearest evidence for quantum phase transitions @xcite . a large effective mass introduces a characteristic low energy scale that can easily be tuned by non - thermal control parameters , making hf systems desirable for studying quantum criticality .",
    "an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) has been explored in many hf systems @xcite . however , a magnetic field - tuned qcp in yb - based materials has been limited to only few cases , among stoichiometric compounds , in particular tetragonal ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite and hexagonal ybagge @xcite .",
    "recently , the hf compound ybptbi attracted attention because of a quantum phase transition driven by magnetic field @xcite , in particular providing relatively easy access to the field - tuned qcp as well as the appearance of a new phase between the ordered ( afm ) state and paramagnetic fermi liquid state .",
    "ybptbi has face - centered cubic ( f@xmath33 m ) structure and manifests afm ordering below @xmath4 = 0.4 k with an electronic specific heat coefficient of @xmath5 @xmath0 7.4 j / mol k@xmath1 at zero field @xcite .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments characterized the averaged ordered moment of @xmath0 0.8 @xmath6/yb with the afm propagation vector @xmath7 = ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) @xcite .",
    "a field - tuned qcp is readily accessible by suppressing afm ordering below @xmath4 = 0.4 k by application of external magnetic field of @xmath8 @xmath0 4 koe @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity indicates a recovery of the fermi liquid ( fl ) state for @xmath9 @xmath10 7.8 koe .",
    "in addition , of particular interest in ybptbi is the fact that a new phase appears in the proximity of the qcp . in this new phase , strange metallic metallic behavior ( non - fermi liquid ) manifests and separates the afm state and fl regime .",
    "a crossover scale has been found in thermodynamic and transport measurements @xcite , where the crossover line shows a tendency of converging toward to @xmath9 @xmath0 7.8 koe in the zero temperature limit . a similar phase near qcp and the crossover line",
    "have been observed in ybagge @xcite and ge - doped ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "although many examples of qcp have been reported in hf materials @xcite , theoretical classifications have not been firmly established yet . unlike the traditional picture ( e. g. for a spin density wave ) of approaching a quantum criticality @xcite , where the heavy quasiparticles survive near the qcp , the unconventional way ( local quantum criticality ) to explain quantum phase transition suggests a destruction of kondo screening of the @xmath11-electrons @xcite , involving fermi surface reconstruction , where the heavy quasiparticles decompose into the conduction sea and local magnetic moments .",
    "if the fermi surfaces have different shapes or are completely reconstructed across the qcp , then a lifshitz transition , associated with a reconstruction of the fermi surface , must separate the two phases between ordered and disordered state . in general , because most of the hf compounds have multiple fermi surfaces , it is difficult to probe such a lifshitz transition at extremely low temperatures .",
    "transport measurements can address this issue clearly for a system with a single band , however this may not be true for a multiband systems . in metallic systems",
    ", the interpretation of physical quantities requires careful consideration of the fermi surface , especially at the qcp .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the determination of the high - field stabilized fermi surfaces for ybptbi inferred from quantum oscillations and band structure calculations . until now",
    ", there was no direct experimental information about the size or shape of the fermi surface in ybptbi . by producing high quality single crystals",
    ", we are able to infer fermi surfaces by detecting quantum oscillations down to 60 mk , but for only above @xmath0 60 koe , in resistivity measurements .    in principle",
    ", the fermi surface can be studied by comparing the quantum oscillation measurements with electronic structure calculations . however ,",
    "quantum oscillation data in most hf compounds is likely to be incomplete mainly due to the experimental difficulties .",
    "this is a standing problem in hf physics : in order to detect the heavier effective masses , higher magnetic fields and extremely lower temperatures ( order of @xmath0 mk ) are needed , however the mass enhancement can be suppressed due to the application of these larger magnetic fields .",
    "further , when there is a 4@xmath11 electron contribution to the fermi volume , band structure calculations ca nt accurately predict the fermi surface topology in detail and an estimate of the density of states .",
    "therefore , in this study , we focused data analysis on the high field - paramagnetic regime and compared it to the band structure calculations in zero field for simple , trivalent yb .",
    "we confirm the multiband nature of this system , but are unable to identify the heavy fermi surface .",
    "in addition , we compare our results to the family of @xmath12ptbi , where quantum oscillations have been observed for @xmath12 = y , la , ce , and nd @xcite .",
    "single crystals of ybptbi were grown out of a ternary melt with excess of bi as has been described in earlier reports @xcite .",
    "four - probe ac resistivity ( @xmath11 = 16 hz ) measurements were performed in a oxford dilution refrigerator , where the samples were attached to the cold state using ge - varnish .",
    "pt wires were used as leads and attached to the sample with epotek h20e silver epoxy . the magnetic field ( * h * )",
    "was applied along the [ 100 ] and [ 111 ] direction , and the electric current ( * i * ) across the sample was applied perpendicular to * h * : * h * @xmath13 * i*. details of experimental conditions are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to compare the experimental observations of shubnikov - de haas frequencies to the topology of the fermi surfaces , we calculated the zero field band structure of paramagnetic , trivalent , ybptbi . for the fermi surface calculation ,",

    "in addition to the unusual temperature dependence of the sdh frequency for ceptbi , the disappearance of the oscillations was observed above about 25 t at which the magnetic field - induced band structure change was proposed @xcite .",

    "these values are much larger than the predicted value for laptbi and ceptbi @xcite , however four times smaller than the frequencies determined from our experimental results .",

    "as included in core levels appears to be reasonable .",
    "if the fermi level is shifted to lower energy , the experimentally observed frequencies can be matched to the hole - like pockets at the zone center , whereas the electron - like pocket surrounding the zone center will not be detected . as a conjecture ,",

    "similarly the orbits @xmath42 , @xmath5 , and @xmath36 , connected to the @xmath31 , all came from the 3-dimensional shape of the band 56 . without an angular dependence of the sdh measurements , the fermi surface topology can not be determined unambiguously and further theoretical work is needed to unravel the discrepancies in the precise extremal orbit sizes .",
    "since we have observed only small effective masses for ybptbi , it is expected that the hybridization between 4@xmath11 and conduction electrons has been suppressed for these high magnetic fields .",
    "this is consistent with the specific heat results ; the enormous value of @xmath5 @xmath0 7.4 j / mol@xmath43k@xmath1 for @xmath24 = 0 is suppressed to @xmath5 @xmath0 0.15 j / mol@xmath43k@xmath1 for @xmath24 = 50koe and would extrapolate to @xmath0 0.030 j / mol@xmath43k@xmath1 at 140 koe ( using date from @xcite ) .",
    "note that if there are still significant 4@xmath11 electron contributions in this magnetic field range , up to 140koe , it would require much lower temperatures to observe heavy electrons in sdh measurements .",
    "this is a standing problem in hf physics , in order to detect the heavier effective masses , higher magnetic fields and very low temperatures are needed , however the mass enhancement can be suppressed due to the application of these larger magnetic fields .",
    "thus , lower measurement temperatures and crystals with extremely low scattering in terms of dingle temperature are necessary to detect heavier effective mass of carriers .",
    "measuring de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) oscillations as a complementary to sdh oscillations may be another experimental approach since oscillation amplitudes have different dependence of @xmath27 in dhva and sdh .",
    "however , this task can be challenging due to high paramagnetic background signal .",
    "in summary , we have presented shubnikov - de haas quantum oscillations detected in ybptbi , which is the first report on quantum oscillations since the discovery of its heavy fermion behavior in 1991 .",
    "the band structure calculations for the fermi surface are also presented , where treating 4@xmath11 electrons as included in core levels appears to be important in high field regime far beyond the quantum critical point .",
    "comparison is made between the high field oscillations and zero field band structure calculations , allowed us to infer fermi surfaces only in the paramagnetic state .",
    "the current study clearly shows that i ) small oscillation frequencies suggest a low carrier density , consistent with hall effect measurements , ii ) multiple oscillation frequencies imply a multiband nature , and iii ) small effective masses at high fields indicate a suppression of kondo screening , consistent with specific heat results .",
