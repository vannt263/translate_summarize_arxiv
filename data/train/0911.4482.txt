    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are canonically considered the main sources of cosmic - rays in the galaxy .",
    "the detection of non - thermal x - ray emission from snrs clearly indicates that electrons are actually accelerated around the snr shocks @xcite , and the observations can constrain the electron spectra . on the other hand , observational confirmation of accelerated protons is not as easy as that of electrons .",
    "one way to study the acceleration and spectrum of protons is to study gamma - ray emission through @xmath2-interactions and the decay of neutral pions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , molecular clouds are efficient targets of cosmic - ray protons because of their high density .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical studies have suggested that old snrs could be appropriate objects to investigate gamma - ray emission through @xmath2-interactions , because the radiation from the accelerated electrons ( primary electrons ) disappears as the snr evolves , owing to their short cooling time @xcite .",
    "in other words , we could ignore the gamma - rays from primary electrons via inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of ambient soft photon fields and/or non - thermal bremsstrahlung from the interaction of electrons with dense ambient matter .    in this letter",
    ", we consider the evolution of an snr surrounded by molecular clouds .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of cosmic - rays accelerated in the snr and the photon spectrum of the molecular clouds illuminated by the cosmic - rays .",
    "we assume that a supernova explodes in a low - density cavity , because the progenitor star expels ambient dense gas via strong uv - radiation and stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the cavity may also have been created through previous supernova explosions .",
    "what differentiates this study is that we consider whether high - energy cosmic - rays illuminating molecular clouds were accelerated even after the snr became old or they were accelerated only when the snr was young .",
    "we also discuss the influence of particle diffusion on the cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "we construct specific models for the open cluster westerlund  2 and the snr w  28 , and compere the results with latest observations .",
    "westerlund  2 is one of the young open clusters from which tev gamma - ray emission has been detected with h.e.s.s .",
    "it is surrounded by molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray emission is extended ( @xmath3 ) and covers the molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "noticeable objects such as pulsars that can be the source of the gamma - ray emission have not been observed in this region .",
    "@xcite proposed that the gamma - ray emission comes from an old snr , although there is no clear signature of snrs in the cluster .",
    "w  28 is a mixed - morphology snr interacting with a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "it is an old snr and tev gamma - rays have been detected from molecular clouds around the snr @xcite .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the proton spectrum around westerlund  2 and w  28 can be fitted with a power - law with an index @xmath4 ( the definition is shown in equation  [ [ eq : npe ] ] ) . moreover",
    ", the shock waves seem to have finished accelerating particles for those objects , while the surrounding regions are bright in the gamma - ray band . here",
    ", we briefly discuss what they mean before we explain assumptions in our specific models for westerlund  2 and w  28 .",
    "if the duration of particle acceleration is shorter than that of the diffusion , and the particle source is spatially localized well , we can use the analytical solution in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where particles are accelerated mainly when the snr is young and compact , and the molecular cloud illuminated by accelerated cosmic - rays is distant from the snr shock .",
    "if the shape of the source spectrum is a power - law with an index @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the energy spectrum at the position of the cloud ( @xmath7 ) is represented by @xmath8 if radiative cooling during the diffusion can be ignored .",
    "the diffusion length is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic field . at a point distant from an snr",
    ", we expect that @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for a given magnetic field , the energy spectrum is represented by @xmath14 if @xmath15 at the position of the molecular cloud .",
    "this means that even if particles are accelerated efficiently ( @xmath16 ) , the energy spectrum must be soft ( @xmath17 ) . in other words , if the index of the spectrum is observed to be @xmath18 at a molecular cloud , it is likely that the particles are accelerated near the cloud after the snr becomes large .    for westerlund  2 and w  28 , since the spectral indices are @xmath4 for the high - energy protons",
    "( @xmath19  tev ) that are illuminating the molecular clouds around these objects , we expect that the cosmic - rays were accelerated near the molecular clouds even after the snrs became old and large .",
    "this may be in contrast with the assumption often adopted in theoretical studies .",
    "we assume that the snr shock had traveled in a low - density cavity . during the propagation in the cavity ,",
    "the shock wave is in the adiabatic sedov phase , because the low - density prevents the radiative cooling .",
    "thus , even if particles can be accelerated only during the sedov phase , they are being accelerated until the shock reaches and collides with the surrounding high - density region , which is an effective target of the cosmic - rays .",
    "the particles illuminate the high - density region with the energy spectrum at the acceleration site or the shock .",
    "thus , the spectral indices of @xmath18 are possible .      for westerlund  2 and w  28 , efficient particle acceleration around shock waves seems to have finished . for the former ,",
    "there is no signature of a shock .",
    "thus , the shock may have already collided with the surrounding dense region and dissipated . for",
    "the latter , the shock is traveling in a relatively high density region ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) and seems to be in a radiative phase @xcite .",
    "thus , cosmic - rays that are illuminating molecular clouds might be accelerated in the past . for @xmath22 and @xmath23 in equation ( [ eq : de ] ) , @xcite estimated the diffusion time of cosmic - rays in a typical molecular cloud and showed that it is only @xmath24  yr for protons with an energy of @xmath20  tev .",
    "however , the probability that the particle acceleration has finished within @xmath24  yr must be very small .",
    "therefore , in the next section we simply assume that @xmath25 around the snrs and later discuss it quantitatively",
    ". the small @xmath26 may be because of the generation of plasma waves by cosmic - rays @xcite .",
    "note that if particles are accelerated with a spectral index of @xmath16 , and if they diffuse in the interstellar gas and illuminate molecular clouds before the index increases to @xmath27 , the observed spectral index could be @xmath4 as the ones observed in westerlund  2 and w  28 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath26 and/or the distance between the snr and the molecular clouds must be fine - tuned in this case . in particular , for w  28 , the molecular clouds are adjacent to the snr @xcite and there seems to be no room to adjust the distance .",
    "thus , we do not consider this possibility .",
    "we assume that the distance to westerlund  2 is @xmath28  kpc @xcite .",
    "we also assume that a supernova exploded at the center of a cavity , which is filled with warm gas , and is surrounded by molecular clouds ( fig .",

    "the size of the cavity is based on the arc structure found by @xcite .",
    "when the shock expands in the cavity , the shock velocity @xmath30 is written as a function of the snr age ( @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 where @xmath33  cm  s@xmath34 is the initial velocity of the ejecta @xcite . at @xmath35",

    "we do not consider non - linear effects , and thus @xmath47 is equal to or smaller than 4 .",

    "after the collision , it takes @xmath84  yr until the shell velocity decreases to the internal velocity of the clouds ( @xmath85 ; @xcite ) .",

    "for this object , protons accelerated at an earlier stage of the sedov phase ( when the mach number of the shock is large ) may be illuminating molecular clouds .",
    "moreover , if molecular clouds are distributed with various sizes and distances from the snr , the gamma - ray spectrum may be the superposition of the spectrum of each cloud and may reflect the energy - dependence of particle diffusion ( equation  [ [ eq : de ] ] ; see @xcite ) ."
