    "now we present numerical results for the andreev reflection coefficients and the tunneling conductance for the @xmath71 junction with @xmath72 . in this condition , there is a large mismatch of fermi surfaces on the g and sg sides .",
    "such a mismatch is well known to act as an effective barrier@xcite .",
    "the transport properties of the two cases of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 are significantly different . in the case of @xmath73 ,",
    "i.e. , the incident electron and the reflected hole both lie in the conduction band , which results in the `` retro - andreev reflection '' , while in the case of @xmath75 , only the `` specular andreev reflection '' takes place , since the incident electron in the conduction band is converted into the reflected hole in the valence band@xcite . in general , it is very difficult to reach the regime @xmath76 in experiment@xcite .",
    "so we only consider the case of @xmath73 and the condition of comparable @xmath15 and @xmath26 , in the latter of which both normal andreev reflection and specular andreev reflection play roles and we can see that the retroreflection crosses over to specular andreev reflection .",
    "firstly , we consider dependence of the transport properties on the sg - barrier thickness .",
    "the tunneling conductance through the sg - barrier as a function of the thickness for different potential strengths @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . dimensionless thickness @xmath78 is used .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath79 and 10 , respectively .",
    "when the bias voltage is small , the conductance exhibits oscillation features .",
    "their oscillation amplitudes decay with increase of the thickness of the sg layer .",
    "the oscillation period of the shot noise power is the same as that of the conductance .",
    "the shot noise characterises correlations of the current .",
    "it can be seen from the curves that the growing trend of the shot noise is opposite to that of the conductance .",
    "when the conductance reaches the maximum value , the shot noise approaches the minimum value .",
    "this can be interpreted by the relation between the shot noise and the properties of the scatterer .",
    "a coherent conductor with all the transmission channels open ( the open channel means that the transmission probability is close to one . ) has minimal shot noise with the fano factor approaching 0 .",
    "a coherent conductor with all closed channels ( the closed channel means that the transmission probability is close to zero . ) has maximal shot noise with the fano factor approaching 1 .",
    "the strength of the shot noise is in the middle of the two limits when a conductor has open and closed channels coexistent .",
    "therefore large transmission probabilities enhance the conductance and suppress the shot noise .",
    "it can also be seen in the panels ( b ) and ( d ) that for the case of @xmath80 the conductance and shot noise decrease with the increase of the thickness of the sg layer .",
    "this is because that the parameter @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath81 for identical @xmath77 and it is in the exponential form of @xmath82 in the wave function as shown in eq .",
    "( [ sgwavefunctions ] ) .",
    "it is larger for the case of @xmath80 than for the case of @xmath83 , which results in the quick decrease of the shot noise and the conductance . on the other hand",
    ", we can see from fig .",
    "2 that with the increase of the potential strength , the tunneling conductance decreased , which illustrates that the fermi surface mismatch between the normal and superconducting regions suppresses transmission .",
    "we also considered the dependence of the tunneling conductance on the value of @xmath77 for small bias voltages .",
    "as expected , we found that the oscillation amplitude decreases monotonically with the increase of @xmath77 in the case of @xmath80 and finally approaches a constant value .    in figs . 3 and 4 , we provide numerical results of the tunneling conductance as a function of the bias voltage @xmath68 .",
    "similar results to beenakkers@xcite are obtained . in the limit of @xmath84 ,",
    "all the conductances have the same value of @xmath85 . for the case of @xmath86 ,",
    "a sharp change in the conductance occurs at @xmath87 and all the conductances vanish at @xmath88 , which is shown in fig .",
    "this is because of that no andreev reflection occurs for all the incident angles ( the critical angle of incidence @xmath89 ) when @xmath90 . for the small bias voltages before the turning point @xmath88 , the conductance decreases with the increase of the sg energy gap .",
    "the conductance curves exhibit oscillatory behavior in the region of @xmath91 , which is different from the condition considered by beenakker . by analyzing the transmission coefficients of the system",
    ", we found that in the condition of @xmath91 the transmission spectrum demonstrates oscillatory behavior and the oscillating period increases with the increase of the sg energy gap .",
    "the oscillatory behavior originates from the effect of the quantum - mechanical interference between the electron - like and hole - like quasiparticles@xcite in the sg barrier .",
    "this effect gives rise to oscillations in the reflection and transmission probabilities for the incident energies larger than the gap energy .    in fig .",
    "4 , numerical results of the conductance for different sg - barrier thickness @xmath92 are provided .",
    "it can be seen that the conductance is sensitive to the sg - barrier thickness , especially in the condition of @xmath91 . in this condition , the oscillation period increases and the oscillation amplitude decreases sharply with the increase of the thickness .",
    "this is also a result of the exponential term @xmath82 in the wave function .",
    "it can be interpreted by the @xmath93 limit . in this limit , the components of the wave function with the exponential term @xmath94 are nonphysical , therefore only two of the components of wave function in the sg - region are physical .",
    "the model reduces to that of the the g / sg - junction , in other words , the model proposed by beenakker@xcite is obtained .",
    "we also considered the shot noise properties of the conductance through",
    "the g / sg / g structure .",
    "numerical results of the shot noise and the fano factor are provided in fig .",
    "the parameters of panels ( a ) and ( c ) are the same with fig . 4 and teh parameters of ( b ) and ( b ) are the same with fig .",
    "3 . we can see from the curves that the shot noise oscillates greatly in the region of @xmath95 , while it increases monotonically in the region @xmath96 .",
    "these behaviors are similar to the tunneling conductance . in tunneling through the g / sg / g - structure ,",
    "transmission is enhanced by the active hole channels . as a result , the values of the shot noise are small in comparison with the poisson value , which is @xmath97 corresponding to the uncorrelated transport . when the hole channels in addition to the electron channels contribute to the transport , the interference effect is strong and the shot noise is significantly suppressed . in the region of @xmath96 ,",
    "the impact of the proximity effect in the sg - region is strong giving rise to strong conductance and the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 approach 0 .",
    "in the case of @xmath95 , the amplitude of oscillation decreases with the increase of @xmath100 ; in the case of @xmath96 , the amplitude of oscillation increases with the increase of @xmath100 , which originates from the same reason as the conductance .",
    "based on the dirac  bogoliubov  de gennes equation and the scattering theory , we investigated the transport properties of the relativistic electrons and holes through the g / sg / g junction .",
    "we have deduced the analytical formulas of the tunneling conductance and the shot noise .",
    "numerical results of the tunneling conductance and shot noise in the system are provided .",
    "we compared the two cases , one of which is in the presence of the specular andreev reflection and the other of which is in the absence of the specular andreev reflection .",
    "the physical results can be summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , the conductance increases with the increase of the thickness of the sg - layer and the shot noise is suppressed by the conductance in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "secondly , the potential strength significantly affects the transport properties .",
    "it suppresses the conductance and enhances the shot noise .",
    "thirdly , we obtained similar results with the model of the g / sg junction in the condition @xmath101 . in the limit of @xmath102 ,",
    "the results of beenakker for a g / sg junction can be reproduced .",
    "fourthly , the thickness of the sg - layer affects the conductance and the shot noise more prominently in the condition @xmath95 , causing the decrease of the oscillation amplitudes and the characteristic features of the specular andreev reflection . in conclusion ,",
    "the conductance is a combined result of the andreev reflection and the specular andreev reflection , which can be tuned by the system parameters ; the shot noise is suppressed by the sg - barrier because of the contribution of the hole channels in addition to the electron channels .",
