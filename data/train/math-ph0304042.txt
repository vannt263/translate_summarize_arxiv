    "we also remark that , when @xmath100 , one can regard @xmath99 as a discrete integrable system which generalizes a discrete version of the lotka - volterra equation .",
    "-5 mm    it should be noticed that the discrete time evolution of @xmath99 is defined in terms of a _ subtraction - free _ birational transformation ; we say that a rational function is subtraction - free if it can be expressed as a ratio of two polynomials with real positive coefficients .",
