    "electrical conduction in nanostructured materials consisting of granular metals dispersed in insulating oxide matrix has been investigated since the 1970s@xcite .",
    "the transport from one metallic grain to the other takes place through the intervening insulator ( which may act as the tunnelling barrier ) and the transport is governed by the coulomb charging energy @xmath7 of the metallic grains .",
    "generally at temperatures t @xmath8 the current through such a system is limited by the phenomenon of coulomb blockade ( cb ) that hinders the current for bias v @xmath9 . often these systems show an activated transport with the resistivity showing the relation@xcite : @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is a constant inversely proportional to the strength of hopping between sites , and @xmath2 , the activation energy , is related to the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the average tunnelling distance of the carrier ( @xmath14 intergrain separation ) and @xmath15 is the average grain diameter . the activation energy , @xmath2 , as discussed later on , is related to the charging energy @xmath16 .",
    "this phenomenon becomes even more fascinating when the metallic grains are ferromagnetic .",
    "in such granular magnetic medium , the magnetic energy plays a role and the transport gets modified by the spin order@xcite . in such cases , the tunnelling between metallic grains depends on the spin polarization of the tunnelling electrons and the magnetization of the ferromagnetic metallic grains .",
    "application of the magnetic field , thus , can change this spin polarized tunnelling ( spt ) which gives rise to a change in the current through such systems , leading to the phenomenon of tunnelling magneto resistance ( tmr)@xcite . in arrays of magnetic nanocrystals separated by an insulating tunnelling barrier",
    ", one would expect the phenomenon of spt to be strongly modulated by the contribution from coulomb charging at temperatures t@xmath17 .",
    "the interplay of these two phenomena leads to interesting physics where the transport in the coulomb blockade region can be effectively controlled by an applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "most of the reported investigations of the interplay of spt and cb in granular medium have been done in systems containing nanoparticles of conventional metallic ferromagnets like co and ni embedded in insulating matrix made of sio@xmath18 or al@xmath18o@xmath19@xcite . in this prototypical system , there is a clear separation of the insulating matrix and the dispersed phase of metallic nanoparticles . in recent years , other systems where the insulating layer can be a non - oxide , have been investigated .",
    "for example , in arrays of cofe magnetic nanoparticles where the nanoparticles have been separated by a thin organic insulating layer have been studied to understand the transport in the cb regime@xcite . in this context , systems made up of ferromagnetic metallic oxide nanoparticles , particularly those of perovskite manganites and cobaltates , present an interesting class of systems . in this case , the barrier need not be another material .",
    "the grain boundaries in some of these oxides ( in particular the manganites ) can be highly resistive and can act as a tunnelling barrier , in particular when they are cooled to lower temperatures .",
    "one would expect that in such a system , for sufficiently small crystal size and at sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath20 ) , the coulomb charging effects can show up and one will be able to observe that in i - v measurements . if the ferromagnetic nanocrystals have sufficient spin polarization , then one would expect contribution from spt as the electron tunnels between neighbouring ferromagnetic nanocrystals .    in this paper , we report an investigation of the interplay of spt and cb by measurement of electronic transport ( including non - linear transport ( i - v ) ) in samples of very well characterized @xmath21 ( lcmo ) nanocrystals with size down to 15 nm and temperatures below 5 k and particularly down to 0.3 k , and in magnetic fields upto 14 t. ( note : @xmath21 having particle size in the nanometer regime were synthesized as early as 1996@xcite . )",
    "this system is known to have highly resistive grain boundaries , which can form the tunnelling barrier . for comparison ,",
    "we have also carried out similar experiments in nanocrystals of another perovskite ferromagnetic oxide @xmath1 with size as small as 35 nm . in this system ,",
    "the resistance is not very high and the degree of spin polarization is very low .",
    "this is expected to show weak manifestations of the above effects .",
    "a comparison of the two brings out the special nature of the manganite system and the important role the grain boundaries can play .",
    "investigations on transport in nanocrystals of manganites like lcmo have been done before , however , at temperatures above 5 k. below we give a brief review of some of the relevant published works on this problem to put the present investigation in proper perspective and to high light the new observations that are only seen at lower temperatures .",
    "it had been recognized since long that the grain boundary dominated transport in fine particles of manganites can enhance their magnetoresistance@xcite at low temperature , particularly at low fields . in subsequent investigations",
    "this was attributed to the spt effects  @xcite .",
    "presence of coulomb blockade had been first investigated in fine powders of @xmath22 ( lsmo ) with grain size down to 20 nm for temperatures down to 10 k@xcite .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of resistivity was found to obey eqn . 1 although the activation energy @xmath2 was identified with @xmath7 .",
    "no non - linear transport ( i - v curves ) and effect of magnetic field on the cb phenomenon was investigated .",
    "subsequent studies down to 4 k done on @xmath23 with grain sizes down to 12 nm addressed the issue of grain size distribution , leading to a distribution of charging energies@xcite .",
    "it was found that the activation energy , @xmath2 , decreases with an increase of the particle diameter @xmath15 , although the exact dependence was not explored and tunnelling parameters were not evaluated .",
    "it was proposed that as the field increases , the coupling between grains is enhanced , leading to de - localization of the charges to neighbouring grains .",
    "this reduces the effective capacitance and thus the charging energy .",
    "spin polarized transport ( in presence of coulomb charging ) in thin granular films of lcmo were investigated to explore the role of magnetic energy through temperature and field dependent transport down to 30 k. the resistivity was found to obey eqn .",
    "1 , although there was no correlation established between any dimension / size with the activation energy and no i - v characteristics were studied@xcite . electrical transport in granular lcmo with somewhat larger particle size (",
    "@xmath24 300 nm ) had been investigated@xcite and modelled , although the resistivity does not show any characteristic upturn at low temperatures .",
    "the issue of spin polarized transport has also been investigated@xcite in nanocrystals of lsmo and lcmo close to room temperature through studies of size dependence of low field magnetoresistance ( lfmr ) and a dependence of the lfmr and surface spin susceptibility was established .",
    "due to high temperature the issue of cb was not addressed .    the tunnelling nature of transport through grain boundary ( gb ) junctions using i - v characteristics was investigated in artificial grain boundary junctions in epitaxial films down to 4 k and in magnetic field@xcite . although the issue of spt through the artificial gb junction was investigated , the coulomb charging was of no consequence in such junctions .",
    "investigation of i - v characteristics of nanocrystals of lcmo and lsmo with size down to 30 nm were carried out for temperatures down to 4 k and in magnetic fields upto 9 t and the results were analysed using the theories of barrier tunnelling@xcite .",
    "this investigation brought into picture the important estimate of the barrier to tunnelling occurring at the grain boundaries .",
    "the spt in nanostructured films ( grain sizes @xmath14 30 nm ) of lcmo and lsmo had been probed through investigations of i - v curves and magnetotransport in magnetic fields upto 6 t and down to 4 k@xcite .",
    "the films showed prominent rise in resistivity below 40 k , although there was no clear signature of coulomb charging .",
    "the magnetic field had a big effect on the non - linear transport , as seen through the modification of the dynamic conductance in magnetic field .",
    "very recently the low temperature transport including non - linear transport in different nanostructured manganites ( including nanostructured films ) with grain sizes down to 50 nm have been investigated@xcite in the temperature range down to 3 k and in magnetic fields upto 10 t. the data were analysed using a description of spin - dependent transport incorporating both tunnelling and non - tunnelling transport .",
    "it has been argued that the magnetic field dependent non - linear transport in such systems ( with larger particle size @xmath25 50 nm ) need not arise from cb phenomenon alone .",
    "a review of the published papers on electronic transport in nanostructured manganites shows that while the issue of spt as well as cb have been raised in earlier investigations in the manganite systems , the effect of both the effects occurring together@xcite has not been studied in details .",
    "in particular , their contributions to non - linear i - v curves ( and its link to the resistivity @xmath26 ) as well as the effect of high magnetic field have not been addressed or unambiguously understood .",
    "there was no observation of a gap like feature in bias dependent conductance curve that shows existence of a charging energy @xmath7 , the main reason being that the experiments had not been done to low enough temperature ( t@xmath27 ) with small enough particles and high magnetic fields to clearly identify various effects that may govern the transport in such nanostructured materials .",
    "often the low temperature rise in resistivity in such systems is taken as a sign of entry to the cb dominated regime although it was realized that such a rise in @xmath26 at low t does not necessarily imply existence cb@xcite . in most of these studies , the size dependence of the observed @xmath2 ,",
    "the tunnelling parameters and the effect of the magnetic field on these important parameters have not been investigated .",
    "in particular , none of the studies made a quantitative analysis of the activation energy of the transport in the cb regime using the concept of size dependence that can clearly give the average tunnelling distance @xmath13 , the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function @xmath3 ( and thus the barrier height)@xcite and also their field dependence if any .",
    "we also find that no studies on magnetotransport and i - v characteristics of the nanostructured cobaltate system @xmath1 ( lsco ) have been made except a preliminary report by our group@xcite .",
    "the present investigation was undertaken to carry out these experiments to temperatures as low as 0.3 k and magnetic fields upto 14 t and to quantitatively analyse the transport ( @xmath26 vs t ) , magnetoresistance ( mr ) and the non - linear i - v data in these nanostructured materials . in this temperature range , for most of the nanocrystals of lcmo , the coulomb charging energy @xmath7 is larger than @xmath28 .",
    "we find that a distinct coulomb blockade dominated transport regime develops below 5 k. the transport was found to contain contributions of transport paths that are mostly of tunnelling type .",
    "@xmath2 , obtained from the temperature dependence , was found to depend on the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath15 is the average diameter of the particle and @xmath13 , the average inter - particle separation .",
    "this dependence also allowed us to determine the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function @xmath3 and the height of the tunnelling barrier . at low magnetic fields ,",
    "the transport and the mr are dominated by the spin polarized tunnelling , while at higher magnetic fields , the mr arises from the lowering of the tunnel barrier by the magnetic field leading to an mr that does not saturate even at 14 t. the non linear i - v data were analysed and connection to parameters obtained from the resistivity data was established .",
    "we observed that the bias dependence of the non - linearity shows a conventional barrier dominated type tunnelling which interestingly becomes rather large at high magnetic fields .",
    "the investigation on lsco allows us a comparison with the manganite system and elucidates the role of high spin - polarization and the nature of grain boundary in the manganite systems .",
    "the present investigation was done on two well characterized nanostructured oxides , namely , @xmath23 ( lcmo ) nanocrystals with size down to 15 nm and nanocrystals of @xmath1 ( lsco ) with size down to 35 nm .",
    "the ferromagnetic state in lcmo with size down to 15 nm has been investigated in details by us recently , using magnetization as well as neutron scattering@xcite . it has been found that even down to this size range the long range ferromagnetic order prevails in lcmo with @xmath29 k , albeit with a spontaneous magnetization ( measured from neutron scattering data ) which is 50 @xmath30 of the bulk data .",
    "the ferromagnetic order also persists in the @xmath1 nanocrystals down to the size range investigated .",
    "the samples were synthesized by a polymeric ( polyol ) precursor route to synthesize the nanocrystals@xcite .",
    "this method allows synthesis at a significantly lower sintering temperature compared to the conventional solid state procedure .",
    "typical phase formation occurs at @xmath31 @xmath32c for lcmo and @xmath31 @xmath33c for lsco .",
    "since the phase formation occurs in lsco at higher temperatures , the nanocrystals grow to a relatively larger size compared to that in lcmo .",
    "we optimized these process parameters to obtain phase pure lcmo and lsco nanocrystals which were tested through a number of characterization techniques .",
    "the details of the process as well as the characterization used have been given in our earlier publications on nanomanganites@xcite .",
    "the stoichiometry of the materials were also checked independently by a quantitative analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ( icpaes ) and also iodometric titration .",

    "this gives an independent estimate of @xmath84 nm , which is very close to @xmath85 0.2 nm as obtained from the transport data .",
    "analysis of the size dependence of the activation energy @xmath2 is very useful because it gives values for important parameters that govern the tunnelling process .",
    "this analysis also vindicates the basic assumption that in these systems , the non - magnetic and insulating shell on the nanocrystal serves as the tunnel barrier .",
    "this is an important consideration because in this system , unlike transition metal / insulating oxide systems , no extra insulating phase has been added .",
    "the charging energy @xmath16 , though related to the activation energy @xmath2 , is a distinct physical quantity .",
    "its value depends not only on the particle size @xmath15 , but also on the interparticle separation @xmath13 .",
    "this is given as@xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the dielectric constant of the medium , which for the manganites , is taken as @xmath31 10 ( ref .",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 7 mev for the smallest lcmo particle and 0.25 mev for the largest lcmo particles ( @xmath89 100 nm ) .",
    "thus , even for the largest particles , the lowest temperature range of measurement is lower than @xmath16 .",
    "the basic assumption of the validity of transport in cb regime is thus satisfied .",
    "the field dependence of the transport parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath61 and @xmath3 for the lcmo nanocrystal system with smallest size ( @xmath89 15 nm ) are shown in fig .",
    "the changes in these parameters cause the suppression of the resistance in the magnetic field and hence the mr .",
    "the field dependences of @xmath2 and the resistivity pre - factor @xmath61 are distinct , and , as stated before , distinguish the physical origin of the lfmr ( as mainly arising from a reduction in @xmath61 ) and the mr at higher field ( as mainly arising from a reduction in @xmath2 as well as a gradual reduction in @xmath61 ) . in the same graph",
    ", we also show the field dependence of @xmath3 obtained from eqn .",
    "the important observation in lcmo is the existence of a rather substantial lfmr when the transport has predominantly tunnelling nature .",
    "this is traced to a sharp lowering of @xmath61 in low magnetic field .",
    "the term @xmath61 depends on the spin polarization of the tunnelling electrons and relative orientation of the magnetization of the two nanocrystals between which the tunnelling occurs .",
    "it has been shown that the tunnelling conductance for spin - polarized tunnelling @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the spin polarization and @xmath92 is the angle between the moments of two ferromagnetic nanocrystals  @xcite . in that case",
    "the value of @xmath61 due to spin polarization will be : @xmath93 where , @xmath94 is the average of the @xmath95 factor . due to the high value of the spin polarization of the tunnelling electron and the alignment of the magnetic moments in the nanocrystals at low field ,",
    "@xmath94 will increase substantially when the field is applied , leading to a decrease in @xmath61 as observed in the low field region .",
    "this decrease in @xmath61 due to spin polarization is expected to saturate at field values where the technical saturation point is achieved in the m - h curves . at this field value",
    ", the nanocrystals will have their spins almost aligned .",
    "the continual and gradual decrease of @xmath61 without saturation as the field is enhanced to 14 t arises from decrease of @xmath3 as discussed below .    from eqn .",
    "3 it can be seen that since @xmath12 does not change with magnetic field , the change in the activation energy @xmath2 will arise from a change in the parameter @xmath3 which is a measure of the barrier height @xmath4 .",
    "the reduction in @xmath3 ( and hence @xmath2 ) in magnetic field is thus expected to arise from a reduction in @xmath96 .",
    "we find that the changes in @xmath3 in magnetic field do not saturate at higher field and thus provide a clear basis for nonsaturation of the mr .",
    "the change in @xmath96 in applied field , as derived from @xmath3 , is shown in fig .",
    "11 . at high field (",
    "fields above few t ) , the spins in the core region of the nanocrystals are aligned and the magnetization is mainly saturated .",
    "any change in the barrier can arise from a change in the zeeman energy .",
    "for lcmo , using the core spin value as the value of the saturation magnetization of the bulk @xmath97@xcite , the zeeman energy at a field of 14 t is @xmath14 6 mev .",
    "this is very close to the observed change in the barrier @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "thus the change in @xmath2 and its non - saturation in high magnetic field can be traced to lowering of barrier @xmath96 in magnetic field due to zeeman effect and its consequent effect of suppression of @xmath3 .",
    "the gradual lowering of the resistivity factor @xmath61 , which is @xmath98 ( see eqn .",
    "5 ) can also be explained by the lowering of @xmath96 in magnetic field .",
    "reduction in @xmath96 lowers @xmath3 and leads to the depression of @xmath61 .     on magnetic field.,width=302,height=264 ]    a quantitative evaluation of all the parameters , as is done in this investigation , allows us to cleanly separate out the effects of spin - polarized tunnelling and the effect of coulomb blockade dominated tunnelling parameters in determining the low temperature transport in these materials .",
    "in particular , distinct effects of the magnetic field in the low field region ( controlling the spin polarization dominated regime ) and in the high field region ( as arising from lowering of barrier ) can be clearly evaluated . extending these measurements to low temperatures and to high fields",
    "adds to this understanding .",
    "the analysis of the resistivity as well as the magnetotransport data has shown that in the temperature range of our investigation , the transport is through a network of tunnel junctions that consists of the metallic ferromagnetic oxide nanocrystals as electrodes and the intervening grain boundary regions as tunnel barriers .",
    "thus , an investigation of the non - linear i - v characteristics in these materials at low temperatures will provide information on the tunnelling type transport through these materials .",
    "the i - v characteristics of the systems studied have been shown in fig . 7 and fig .",
    "8 . the data on lsco shows mainly ohmic behavior and the i - v curves are more or less linear .",
    "we do not discuss this system further .",
    "we plot the differential conductance @xmath99 vs bias voltage v curves in fig .",
    "12 for the lcmo system for the smallest nanocrystal size ( d = 15 nm ) .",
    "the data shown are for zero field and with varying temperature and for fixed temperature ( t = 0.3 k ) with applied fields varying upto 5 t.        it is noted that the @xmath100 at lowest temperatures show gap like features below a bias of 5 mv .",
    "the appearance of a gap of this magnitude in the @xmath101 curve is expected in view of the existence of a coulomb charging energy @xmath16 which , for the nanocrystals of this size , we estimated to be @xmath14 7 mev . the observed value and the estimates are thus very close .",
    "thus the non - linear transport data clearly shows existence of the coulomb gap .",
    "application of magnetic field as well as increase in temperature fills up the gap region and it closes by a field of 0.2 t and for t @xmath36 0.7 k. the observation of such a clear gap like feature in the @xmath101 curve has not been seen before .",
    "this is because the present investigation was carried down to a temperature range , where the condition t @xmath102 is well satisfied .    to explore the nature of non@xmath103linearity in the i - v characteristics ,",
    "the bias dependence of the differential conductance ( @xmath100 versus v curves ) have been fit to the empirical equation as has been done for investigating artificial grain boundary junctions before@xcite : @xmath104 this is a two parameter relation that quantifies the nonlinearity through the exponent @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the latter being a measure of the weight of the nonlinear transport . at lowest @xmath107 ,",

    "the data have been fit to a bias ( @xmath110 ) upto @xmath14 40 mev . for applied bias beyond this value ,",

    "@xmath105 decreases as the electron crosses the barrier through the localized states in the barrier .",
    "specifically , @xmath111 , where , @xmath112 is the number of localized states in the barrier through which tunnelling occurs . for no scattering in the barrier , @xmath113 = 0 and @xmath105 = 2 . for thick barriers often @xmath112 can be very large and in that case @xmath114 1 .",
    "past investigations on artificial gb junctions have shown the applicability of the above ideas for a gb based junction@xcite .",
    "it was also shown that at low temperatures , existence of disordered materials in the barrier region can contribute a @xmath115 term to @xmath109@xcite .",
    "existence of all the parallel channels can contribute simultaneously to the tunnelling conductance @xmath109 and the observed @xmath105 will be an effective average value that will weigh the contributions from all the bias dependent channels . as the relative contributions of all the channels may vary with t as well as h , the exponent @xmath105 can also vary .",
    "the observed value of the exponent @xmath105 changes from a value of 1.7 at lowest temperature measured ( and in zero field ) and reaches a value of nearly 2 at higher temperature ( as well as in higher applied magnetic field ) as expected for a conventional barrier tunnelling junction@xcite .",
    "we suggest that at lower temperatures , there is a contribution like @xmath116 arising from a parallel transport through the disordered region ( non - tunnelling type ) which will lower the effective @xmath105 .",
    "the gradual change of the exponent @xmath105 to the value 2 thus shows the predominance of the tunnel type transport through the barrier in the gb region .",
    "the temperature dependence of the zero bias conductivity @xmath108 is expected to be similar to that of the conductivity ( = @xmath117 ) .",
    "@xmath108 increases as the temperature is increased from 0.3 k to 3 k and we find that down to 0.7 k , it follows the temperature dependence @xmath118 .",
    "the value of the activation energy @xmath119 was found to be 1.5 mev which is similar to @xmath2 ( @xmath14 1.8 mev ) obtained from the @xmath26 data .",
    "the increase in t also suppresses the non - linearity as seen by a substantial suppression of @xmath106 . above a few k ,",
    "the transport is mainly through non - tunnelling mechanisms as increased scattering in the gb region makes the tunnelling process very weak .",
    "an important observation from our work is the strong effect of the magnetic field on i - v curves at low temperatures .",
    "application of the magnetic field enhances the conductivity ( both @xmath106 and @xmath108 ) and suppresses the gap like feature in the @xmath120 curves .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath106 is very steep below 0.2 t",
    "( by nearly 2 orders ) which is qualitatively similar to the lfmr and then it changes gradually beyond that field and the change saturates beyond 14 t. the relative enhancement of the non - linear term @xmath106 with application of field in the low field region is much more than the term @xmath121 .",
    "for instance , between zero field and a field of 1 t the ratio @xmath122 changes by 2 orders from @xmath123 to @xmath124 and beyond that it stays constant at this value as the field is increased .",
    "thus at higher field , since the ratio @xmath122 is field independent , the change in both occurs mainly due to barrier height change in the magnetic field as one would expect from a tunnelling process controlled by a barrier@xcite .",
    "there is a rapid rise in the junction current i beyond a bias of 35 mev ( see fig .",
    "this is most visible in the i - v data under high field and at low temperatures .",
    "we find that the rapid rise of the current typically occurs at a given power @xmath125 130 - 150 nw at 0.3 k ( for the data in different magnetic fields ) and at somewhat higher powers as the temperature increases .",
    "we conclude that this rapid rise is a manifestation of thermal run - away which is most visible in the data taken with a magnetic field , because the junctions due to high conductance carry a high current and dissipate higher power .",
    "it is for this reason that our data analysis has been restricted to lower bias with measurement power @xmath35 0.5@xmath126 .",
    "the investigation done here brings out the difference between a strongly spin polarized system like lcmo ( half - metallic ) and a system lacking such strong spin polarization , namely , lsco . the absence of spin polarization in lsco is reflected in the absence of a discernible lfmr .",
    "the grain boundary in lsco is much less resistive , the transport shows a low value of @xmath2 and the i - v curves are almost linear showing very weak contribution of tunnelling in case of lsco .",
    "in summary , we have presented a comprehensive study of the electrical transport properties ( including non - linear transport ) of nanocrystals of two ferromagnetic perovskite oxides @xmath0 and @xmath1 which vary significantly in their degree of spin polarization .",
    "the studies , done in the temperature range down to 0.3 k and magnetic fields upto 14 t , allow us to investigate the effect of spin polarization in a regime where the inter - grain transport is dominated by tunnelling in coulomb blockade regime in such nanocrystals with sizes down to 15 nm .",
    "it is noted that this is the first time such measurements were carried out well below 1 k where the t @xmath127 .",
    "the transport below 5 k was found to contain contributions of transport paths that are mostly of tunnelling type dominated by coulomb blockade .",
    "the activation energy of transport , @xmath2 , was found to depend on the ratio @xmath12 . from this dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath12 the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function @xmath3 , the height of the tunnelling barrier @xmath96 and",
    "also their magnetic field dependences were determined .",
    "the data taken over a large magnetic field range allowed us to separate out the mr contributions at low temperatures to two distinct contributions . at low magnetic field ,",
    "the transport and the mr are dominated by the spin polarization , while at higher magnetic field the mr arises from the lowering of the tunneling barrier by the magnetic field ( due to zeeman energy ) leading to an mr that does not saturate even at 14 t. the idea of inter - grain tunnelling through the disordered grain boundary region ( which acts as a barrier to tunnelling ) has been validated by direct measurements of the non - linear i - v data in this temperature range .",
    "we made the important observation that at lowest temperature a gap like feature ( with magnitude @xmath5 ) shows up in the @xmath109 versus v curve for the systems with smallest nanocrystal size .",
    "the gap closes as the field and the temperature are raised and one observes a conventional barrier type tunnelling with @xmath128 .",
    "the non - linear transport was found to be strongly dependent on the applied magnetic field .",
