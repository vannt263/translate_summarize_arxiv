    "late type stars constitute the most important tracers for understanding the chemical and kinematical evolution of the galaxy . among them",
    ", unevolved stars , dwarf and subgiant stars , are widely used to probe different stellar populations of the galaxy in the solar neighborhood . however , evolved stars with bright absolute magnitude are necessary targets to extend the galactic study far from the solar neighborhood where the galactic halo is the main population . in this regard , horizontal branch stars with a constant luminosity are the most common stellar tracers and thus are widely used in galactic halo study .",
    "however , we note that the most populated targets of evolved stars in the halo are red giant stars , which will constitute a larger sample of targets for statistical study . in this sense ,",
    "red giant stars are important stellar tracers for galactic evolution .",
    "the sdss and its extensions provide @xmath9 photometry and low resolution spectra for a large amount of galactic stars , including a huge amount of red giant stars having the main spectral types of g and k ( hereafter gk red giants)@xcite .",
    "there are some works on the galaxy based on unevolved stars ( main - sequence and turnoff stars ) of the sdss spectroscopic survey @xcite and a few works adopt later type m giants as stellar tracers @xcite . as we stated above",
    ", unevolved stars reach a smaller distance range than that of evolved stars , and later type m giants mainly represent the metal - rich or young populations @xcite .",
    "instead , gk red giant stars have the advantage of tracing the metal - poor and old populations of the galaxy extending to a distance of at least 20 kpc . however , there is no work on galactic evolution using gk red giant stars as stellar tracers based on the sdss survey in the literature .",
    "thus , it is of high interest to investigate the chemical and kinematic properties of different populations in the galaxy by using gk red giant stars from the sdss spectroscopic survey , which will be the scope of our next paper .",
    "it is expected that a large sample of gk red giant stars in the sdss survey will provide new information on the formation of the halo , the division of the inner and outer halo and the transition from the halo to disk .    before a statistical study can be carried out , clear selection of red giant stars without contamination of stars from other stages",
    "is important .",
    "it is known that evolved stars with gk spectral type in the sdss spectroscopic survey span the entire rgb mixing with the red clump , rhb and early - agb phases .",
    "the contamination of these stars in the rgb sample could affect the spatial , kinematic and chemical distributions in the statistical study .",
    "in particular , distances of red giant stars beyond the solar neighborhood are usually estimated from interpreting the fiducial sequence ( hereafter fs ) of globular clusters ( gcs ) or isochrones of theoretical models . in this way",
    ", wrong distances will be provided for the contaminating stars ( such as red clump , rhb and early - agb stars ) if they are assumed to be rgb stars since they have similar colors but very different luminosities at a given metallicity . in principle",
    ", stellar parameters ( temperature , gravity and metallicity ) from the sspp @xcite in the sdss database can be used to separate evolved and unevolved stars , with @xmath10 being the former . however , since @xmath11 values provided by the sspp pipeline have quite large uncertainties , they can not be used to further classify among evolved stars . in this work",
    ", we are searching for the possible criterion for separating the early - agb and rhb stars from the rgb by using the line index measured from member stars of globular clusters and field stars in the sdss survey .",
    "there are eight gcs in the sdss spectroscopic survey that have enough spectra of member stars for statistical study , and @xcite have presented these cluster stars . for field stars ,",
    "we select a sample of stars from the sdss dr9 catalog with a @xmath0 range of @xmath120.2 to 1.0 @xmath13 , @xmath2}}$ ] from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and @xmath11 less than 3.5 dex , where the main targets are giant stars .",
    "the sample is limited to stars with spectra available in the dr7 database , but the stellar parameters and @xmath0 were taken from the sdss dr9 database .",
    "this limitation of using spectra in dr7 ( instead of dr9 ) will reduce the star number in the field sample , but we assume that there are enough stars in the dr7 database for high statistics .    we have measured the ch(g ) index ( ch g band at @xmath16 ) defined by @xcite and the spectral index s(3839 ) ( cn band at @xmath17  defined by @xcite , following the same definitions adopted in @xcite . note that the released spectra of the sdss dr7 database are flux calibrated and the wavelength is shifted such that measured velocities will be relative to the solar system barycenter at the mid - point of each 15-minute exposure .",
    "we thus corrected the wavelength with the redshift of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is taken from the sppparams table of the sdss dr7 database ( in order to fit our spectra from dr7 ; and we checked that they are generally in agreement with dr9 ) , @xmath20 is the speed of light , and 7.3 km  s@xmath21 is an empirically derived offset putting the @xmath19 of all stars on a system consistent with that of other literature measures of known radial velocity standards as described in @xcite .",
    "then we interpolate the spectra and produce new spectra with 5,000 points for the wavelength range of 3840 - 4500  ( versus @xmath22700 points in the original spectra ) so that the measurements of the line index will not depend on the chosen points at the edge of the defined bands and thus the line index will become more consistent among stars . we have checked that both sets of data generally agree quite well .",
    "errors are less than 0.03 mag for @xmath0 based on @xmath23 and @xmath24 sdss photometric errors , less than 0.015 @xmath13 for the s(3839 ) index and less than 0.012 @xmath13 for the ch(g ) index . to determine the errors on the line index we included errors in the flux ( available in the sdss spectra fits files ) and in the wavelength shift ( via the radial velocity errors ) since these are the two dominant sources of uncertainty in our determination .",
    "the comparison of our indices with those of smolinski et al .",
    "( 2011b ) shows a systematically higher value for the ch(g ) index and lower value for the s(3839 ) index by the order of @xmath25 in our work with a small scatter of @xmath26 .",
    "the systematic deviation disappears if we adopt the redshift available in the fits file headers .",
    "therefore , the small scatter in the line index comparison indicates a good agreement between smolinski et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and our work .",
    "the wavelength correction by using @xmath19 in our work is more reasonable than using the redshift in the fits file headers since this is the way that the sdss survey presents its spectra . but both works have internally consistent values for stars and thus this difference will not significantly affect the results .",
    "among the eight gcs in the sdss spectroscopic survey , only m3 has a significant number of agb stars , while others do not have many early - agb and rhb member stars .",
    "thus we start the study from globular cluster m3 in this work .",
    "we adopted the member star list of m3 from @xcite ( their table 3 ) and obtained photometry and stellar parameters from the sdss dr9 database @xcite . with the adopted distance modulus of 15.070 in @xmath27 band and reddening of 0.010 from the new version of @xcite published in 2010 we calculated the absolute magnitude in @xmath23 band ( @xmath28 ) for each star .",
    "there are 77 member stars in the list of @xcite , but we exclude four bhb stars with @xmath29 since they are not in the color range of gk red giant stars . moreover , we found one star with the identification numbers ( plate - mjd - fiberid ) of 2475 - 53845 - 486 is significantly outside the fs of m3 , which was excluded as well . among the remaining 72 member stars ,",
    "three groups are divided according to their evolutionary stages .",
    "there are 12 rhb ( open squares ) , 10 early - agb ( open diamonds ) and 50 rgb stars ( filled circles ) , which are shown in fig",
    "the solid line in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the observed fs of m3 based on @xcite and the dash - dotted line shows a theoretical isochrone of 11.5 gyr , which is close to 11.3 gyr for m3 .",
    "also shown are dotted lines for 8 and 14 gyr isochrones at @xmath2}}= -1.5 $ ] from the dartmouth isochrones @xcite .",
    "it seems that age variation from 8 to 14 gyr has no significant effect on the cmd and thus it is possible to extrapolate our result to field stars with different ages in the following sections .",
    "the upper - right panel of fig .  1 shows the ch(g ) index as a function of @xmath0 with three groups of stars indicated by different symbols .",
    "the lower two panels present the s(3839 ) index as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath30 , and stars with enhanced s(3839 ) index are indicated by additional pluses in fig .",
    "it is interesting that the rgb is clearly separated from early - agb stars in the @xmath0 versus the ch(g ) index diagram despite their similar colors . in the s(3839 ) vs. @xmath0 diagram , rgb stars with @xmath31 show two branches with a clear gap in between .",
    "early - agb stars lie in between but are located closer to the lower branch .",
    "there is a hint of lower ch(g ) indices for s(3839)-strong rgb stars as compared with s(3839)-weak rgb stars , but it is difficult to separate them considering significant scatter in the ch(g ) index at a given @xmath0 color . with significantly lower @xmath0 colors ,",
    "rhb stars have even lower ch(g ) indices due to their higher temperatures .",
    "the implication from fig .",
    "1 is that the ch(g ) index is a better criterion than the s(3839 ) index for excluding early - agb stars from rgb stars .",
    "moreover , in comparison with the @xmath32 versus @xmath11 diagram in fig .  2 , we can see that the ch(g ) index is a more successful way to exclude early - agb and rhb / bhb stars .",
    "the origin for the lower ch(g ) indices for agb stars than those of rgb stars at similar colors is the so - called weak g - band effect first noted by @xcite .",
    "this effect comes from a combination of low carbon abundances and low gravities in the agb stars @xcite .",
    "the lower carbon abundance in agb stars than rgb stars at similar colors was theoretically predicted since @xcite and very recently by @xcite , who proposed a theoretical model of carbon evolution for m3 and showed that carbon abundances decrease after the bump of the rgb due to the onset of extra mixing . with bright luminosities ,",
    "the early - agb stars of m3 in our work have lower gravities than rgb stars at similar colors and are in a later stage after the bump of the rgb .",
    "both factors contribute to the significant gap between the early - agb stars and lower rgb stars in the @xmath0 versus ch(g ) diagram .    in order to check if the ch(g )",
    "index can successfully separate rgb stars from other contaminations at a given metallicity similar to m3 , we select a sample of stars from sdss dr9 with @xmath33 @xmath13 , @xmath34}}\\,\\leq\\,-1.4 $ ] dex and @xmath35 dex , where the main targets are giants . in order to avoid the early type stars ,",
    "we limit the stars to have sspp temperatures from 3000k to 10000k and the signal - to - noise ratio larger than 10 . we do not limit the low edge of @xmath11 , but we note that our selected stars with sspp parameters available in the sdss database have surface gravity of @xmath36 .",
    "3 shows the @xmath0 versus ch(g ) index for the above selected field stars with locations of member stars of m3 overplotted .",
    "it seems that most stars with @xmath31 in our selected field sample are rgb stars and they match the locations of rgb stars of m3 . in order to apply the method for further use , we have established a calibration between the ch(g ) and @xmath0 for rgb stars of @xmath37 .",
    "the dashed lines follow the above calibrated line with a deviation of @xmath38 dex in the ch(g ) index at a given @xmath0 color .",
    "stars within the dashed lines are classified as rgb stars .",
    "stars significantly lower than the calibration may consist of early - agb and rhb stars as indicated by member stars in m3 . turnoff and main sequence stars",
    "are clumped at the blue edge with @xmath0 from 0.2 to 0.4 @xmath13 , they have ch(g ) index lower than @xmath39 , and overlap with hb stars .",
    "rhb stars have a wider range of @xmath0 from 0.2 to @xmath40 but also have ch(g ) indices less than @xmath39 .",
    "in order to extend the study to other metallicities , we investigated the spectroscopic data of the sdss survey for m92 and m15 , which have metallicities of @xmath2}}\\sim -2.3 $ ] .",
    "4 shows the evolutionary stages , the ch(g ) and s(3839 ) indices as a function of @xmath0 , and the absolute magnitude versus s(3839 ) index .",
    "the same symbols as in fig .  1 are used and turnoff stars from the gcs are shown as crosses .",
    "the same results are found at this metallicity but the scatter is slightly larger than that in m3 .",
    "specifically , the only possible agb star is located at the lower edge in the diagram of the @xmath0 versus ch(g ) index , and subgiants and turnoff stars generally have lower ch(g ) indices than those of rgb stars . in particular , a few stars with enhanced s(3839 ) indices lie in the middle part of the @xmath0 versus ch(g ) index diagram among member stars .",
    "thus , the s(3839 ) index is not taken into account in selecting rgb stars in the following sections .",
    "note that the deviation in the ch(g ) index is large for one rgb star with the plate - mjd - fiberid numbers of 1960 - 53289 - 530 and the reason for this odd value is unknown . in connection with possible differences between cluster and field stars ,",
    "there are more cluster stars than field stars at the red end of rgb stars in m3 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , which are lacking in m15/m92 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the difference in stellar color distribution between cluster and field stars comes from the target selection of the clusters in the sdss spectroscopic survey because stars within the cluster tidal radius are favorably selected as targets and thus the color range of the targets depends on the distance of the cluster .",
    "this selection criterion is not applied in the target selection of the general field .",
    "in addition , there is a hint that the ch(g ) band index for field stars are slightly higher than those of the cluster stars at a given color in fig .  5 and possibly in the blue end of rgb stars in fig .",
    "this discrepancy comes from the different absolute magnitudes of the stars in the sense that bright field stars with @xmath41 show a slightly higher ch(g ) band index than that of fainter stars with @xmath42 in fig .  5 .",
    "the quality in the spectra of cluster stars is higher than the average value of field stars at the blue end of rgb stars ( and also fainter magnitude ) , which leads to a slightly lower ch(g ) index .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty in reddening for field stars could be larger than that of cluster stars , which could also contribute to the larger scatter ( via @xmath0 color ) for field stars as compared with cluster stars in this diagram .    in a similar procedure as for m3 , we selected a sample of field stars from the sdss dr9 database with a @xmath0 range of 0.1 to 0.8 @xmath13 , @xmath2}}$ ] from @xmath43 to @xmath44 dex and @xmath11 less than 3.5 dex , and the @xmath0 versus ch(g ) index diagram is shown in fig .  5 .",
    "the member stars from m92 and m15 are overplotted .",
    "then we established a calibration for the selected field stars located in the rgb region of fig .",
    "we found that the coefficients are very similar to those at @xmath2}}= -1.5 $ ] , but the constant is different .",
    "we thus adopted the same @xmath0 coefficients and obtained the calibration of @xmath45 for @xmath2}}= -2.3 $ ] as shown with the solid line in fig .",
    ", the two dashed lines show the locations of rgb stars around the calibration with a deviation of 0.05 @xmath13 in the ch(g ) index at a given @xmath0 color , and stars within the dashed lines are classified as rgb stars . in the selection , many cemp stars ( see later discussions in sect .",
    "3.3 ) with significant enhancement of the ch(g ) index were avoided with the upper cut of the rgb calibration , and a few early - agb stars or agb - related stars are excluded with the low cut of the rgb calibration .",
    "finally , it may be more reasonable to exclude blue stars where the strength of the ch(g ) index starts to decrease for turnoff stars and rhb stars .      in view of similar coefficients but different constants in the calibrations between @xmath0 and ch(g ) index at",
    "@xmath2}}=-1.5 $ ] and @xmath2}}=-2.3 $ ] , we attemp to establish a metallicity - dependent constant for the calibration . for this purpose , we need to extend and obtain constants for more metallicity bins .",
    "first , we selected field stars with @xmath0 of @xmath46 to 1.0 @xmath13 and @xmath11 less than 3.5 dex for each metallicity bin ranging from @xmath2}}<-2.8 $ ] to @xmath2}}=0.0 $ ] with a step of 0.2 dex .",
    "we assume that the main populations of field stars , selected based on @xmath0 of 0.4 to 1.0 @xmath13 and @xmath11 less than 3.5 dex at a given metallicity , are rgb stars in the sdss dr9 database .",
    "this assumption is valid for @xmath2}}=-1.5 $ ] and @xmath2}}=-2.3 $ ] as described above .",
    "again , cemp stars with significant enhancement of the ch(g ) index at a given color and metallicity were avoided and we excluded blue stars with @xmath47 being turnoff stars or rhb / bhb stars .",
    "then we used the above - adopted coefficients for @xmath0 and obtained a set of different constants for the individual metallicity bins in the fitting of rhb stars .",
    "then we fit the constants with a metallicity - dependent linear function , and the final calibration gives @xmath4}}-0.844 $ ] .",
    "6 shows the location of selected rgb stars around the calibration ( the solid line for @xmath2}}\\leq -1.2 $ ] and long dashed line for @xmath2 } } > -1.2 $ ] ) within the deviation of @xmath48 ( the two dashed lines for @xmath2}}\\leq -1.2 $ ] ) .",

    "there are small numbers of stars outside the red cuts until m giants become significant at the metal - rich end .",
    "we should keep in mind that this calibration is only one possible way to select most rgb stars from the sdss database .",
    "it is by no means the only solution to pick out rgb stars . in particular",
    ", this calibration deviates from the centering points of field giant stars and it gives too high values for the high metallicity end and perhaps too low values for the low metallicity end .",
