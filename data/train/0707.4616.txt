    "the kloe experiment is performed at the frascati @xmath7 factory da@xmath8ne@xcite .",
    "da@xmath8ne is a high luminosity @xmath9,@xmath10 collider working at @xmath11 mev , corresponding to the @xmath7 meson mass . in the whole period of data taking ( @xmath12 ) kloe",
    "has collected an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb@xmath0 , corresponding to about 8 billions of @xmath7 produced and @xmath13 millions of @xmath2 mesons through the electromagnetic decay @xmath14 .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber @xcite , dc , surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber sampling calorimeter @xcite , emc , both immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field of 0.52 t with the axis parallel to the beams , @xmath15 in the following .",
    "the dc momentum resolution for charged particles is @xmath16=0.4% .",
    "the calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two endcaps , and covers 98@xmath17 of the total solid angle .",
    "photon energies and arrival times are measured with resolutions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "photon - shower centroid positions are measured with an accuracy of @xmath20 along the fibers , and 1 cm in the transverse direction .",
    "a photon is defined as a cluster of energy deposits in the calorimeter elements that is not associated to a charged particle .",
    "we require the distance between the cluster centroid and the nearest entry point of extrapolated tracks be greater than 3@xmath21 , where @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the trigger @xcite uses information from both the calorimeter and the drift chamber .",
    "the emc trigger requires two local energy deposits above threshold ( @xmath22 mev in the barrel , @xmath23 mev in the endcaps ) .",
    "the trigger has a large time spread with respect to the time distance between consecutive beam crossings .",
    "it is however synchronized with the machine radio frequency divided by four , @xmath24=10.85 ns , with an accuracy of 50 ps . for the 2001 - 2002 data taking , the bunch crossing period was @xmath25=5.43 ns . the time ( @xmath26 ) of the bunch crossing producing an event",
    "is determined offline during event reconstruction .",
    "the value of the @xmath2 mass has been recently measured with high precision by two collaborations na48@xcite ( @xmath27 mev / c@xmath28 ) and gem@xcite ( @xmath29 mev / c@xmath28 ) using different techniques and production reactions .",
    "the two measurements differ by more than eight standard deviations from each other .",
    "the gem measurement is in agreement with the older ones@xcite while the na48 measurement is higher .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to provide a further measurement of comparable precision in order to clarify the experimental situation .",
    "we measure the mass studying the decay @xmath30 . a kinematic fit is performed imposing the 4 constraints given by the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "sing there are three photons and there are 4 constraints , the fit overconstrains the energies of the photons that are , practically , determined by the position of the clusters in the calorimeter .",
    "the inputs of the fit are the energy , the position and the time of the calorimeter clusters , the mean position of the @xmath31 interaction point , the total four - momentum of the colliding @xmath31 pair .",
    "each of these variables is determined run by run using @xmath32 events ( almost 90000 events for each run , allowing a very precise determination of the relevant parameters ) .",
    "the @xmath14 events are selected by requiring at least three energy deposits in the barrel with a polar angle @xmath33 , not associated to a charged track .",
    "a kinematic fit imposing energy - momentum conservation and time of flight of photons equal to the velocity of light is done for all 3 @xmath34 s combination of n detected photons .",
    "the combination with the lowest @xmath35 is chosen as a candidate event if @xmath36 .",
    "the events surviving the cuts are shown in fig.[fig : dalitz ] , where the dalitz plot is shown .",
    "three bands are clearly visible . the band at low @xmath37 is given by the @xmath5 , while the other two bands are @xmath30 events",
    ".     events .",
    "the photons are sorted according their energies @xmath38.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    with the cut shown in the dalitz plot we select a pure sample of @xmath39 events . the resulting @xmath40 spectrum ( fig.[fig : etafit ]",
    ") can be fitted well with a single gaussian of @xmath41 .",
    "the fitted function is the continuous line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to determine the systematic error we have evaluated the uncertainities on all the quantities used in the kinematic fit and the effect on the fitted value .",
    "+ a sample of @xmath42 events has been used to check the mean position of the interaction point , the energy response of the calorimeter and the alignment of the calorimeter with the drift chamber .",
    "the mean position of the interaction point , determined run by run using the @xmath32 events , has been compared with the reconstructed @xmath43 vertex .",
    "the difference between this two values has been computed run by run and the spread of the distribution is used for the systematic error on the determination of the i.p mean position .",
    "since the i.p position is determined with the tracks reconstructed in the drift chamber , small displacement between the dc and the calorimeter can affect position measurement of this point in the calorimeter reference frame . to check disalignment between the calorimeter and the drift chamber , the @xmath44 and @xmath45 tracks of the @xmath46 events",
    "were extrapolated to the calorimeter and the closest approach point to the cluster centroid was determined .",
    "the difference in the position @xmath47 were determined and the spread of these values are taken as systematic error on dc - calo allignment .",
    "a small correction of 1.1 mm in the calorimeter position along the @xmath48 direction , the vertical , and 2 mm along the @xmath15 direction ( the direction of the beam axis ) was applied .",
    "the absolute energy scale of the calorimeter and the linearity of the energy response was checked using the @xmath49 events and the @xmath50 events .",
    "the energy of the @xmath34 can be determined using the two charged tracks in the drift chamber and then compared to the reconstructed cluster energy .",
    "a linearity better than 2 % was found while the absolute scale was found to be calibrated at better than 1 % .",
    "these systematic uncertainties result in just 4 kev for the scale and 4 kev for the linearity on the value of the reconstructed mass .",
    "the measurement shows very small sensitivity to the calorimeter calibration because , as explained before , the kinematic fit overconstraints the photon energy with the cluster positions . + for this reason it is important to evaluate the systematic error due to the misalignment of single modules in the calorimeter .",
    "this has been done evaluating the value of the mass as a functon of the position of the photons in the calorimeter .",
    "a spread of about 10 - 15 kev was found and assumed as systematic error .",
    "+ systematics due to the particular choice of the cut on the dalitz plot shown in fig.[fig : dalitz ] was also determined to be 12 kev , while the cut on the @xmath35 pratically does nt have any effect on the value of the @xmath2 mass ( 0.7 kev ) .",
    "+ the measured value of the mass is , instead , very sensitive to the energy in the center of mass of the @xmath51 system . due to initial state radiation emission ( isr )",
    "the available center of mass energy is a bit lower than the @xmath52 of the @xmath31 beams measured using @xmath32 events .",
    "a variation of 100 kev of the measured mass value is predicted by the mc simulation .",
    "since this correction is realtively large we have checked the simulation of isr emission in the mc in the following way :    * the correction to apply to the fitted value in order to obtain the real value of the mass has been determined as a function of @xmath52 and shown in fig.[fig : isrcorr ] ; * the whole data taking has been devided in ranges of @xmath52 using 8 points for the on peak data and two off - peak points at 1017 mev and 1022 mev ; * the value of the mass obtained for each value of @xmath52 has been corrected according the mc prediction ; * the residual spread of these points has been taken as systematic error ( 8 kev ) ( see fig .
