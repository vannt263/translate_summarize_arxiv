    "the effects from the quantum domain have intriguing consequences for the way we view the world and the way we interpret physical models , and these effects can be seen in single particle phenomena .",
    "plasma physics , on the other hand , deals with the collective interaction of charged particles , and processes related to such . however , there are physical parameter domains where quantum mechanics and plasma physics need to be taken into account simultaneously , e.g. dense and/or hot astrophysical plasmas . indeed , the creation of pair plasmas surrounding neutron stars can be viewed as a collective quantum plasma effect .",
    "thus , there is interest and application for a model taking both collective charged particle effects and quantum phenomena into account ( see , e.g. refs .   and ) .",
    "one of the most prominent models in plasma physics is described by the zakharov equations @xcite , in which high frequency langmuir waves are coupled nonlinearly to low frequency ion - acoustic waves .",
    "the statistical properties of this system has been analyzed in ref .",
    ", where a landau - like damping was found .",
    "recently , a generalization of the zakharov system was derived , taking quantum effects into account @xcite .",
    "the effect of the quantum correction was to introduce higher order dispersion into the system of equations , thus altering the behavior of wave evolution .",
    "it was argued in ref . that these contributions could be important in astrophysical plasmas , as the plasma densities may become significant .    in this paper , we will introduce a kinetic description of the quantum zakharov equation , by applying the wigner transform to the langmuir propagation equation .",
    "the resulting system of equations may be useful for understanding the properties of partially coherent langmuir waves interacting with quantum ion - acoustic waves .",
    "we derive the general dispersion relation , and analyze the stability of the system .",
    "a comparison between monoenergetic langmuir waves and random - phase langmuir waves is given , and it is found that the interplay between quantum corrections and spectral broadening may alter the instability properties in novel ways .",
    "in particular , it is found that the growth rate for a short wavelength partially coherent quantum langmuir wave is larger than the corresponding growth rate for the classical langmuir wave .",
    "thus , the interplay between incoherence and quantum effects gives rise to modified modulational instability growth rates , a result that may be relevant to astrophysical and intense laboratory laser - plasmas , for which the quantum parameter may take on significant values .",
    "the dynamics of the nonlinearly coupled quantum langmuir and ion - acoustic waves is given by the zakharov - like equations @xcite    @xmath0    and @xmath1 [ eq : eqs ]    where @xmath2 is the quantum parameter due to a quantum pressure emanating from the underlying hydrodynamic model @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 is planck s constant divided by @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the ion plasma frequency , @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath7 is the electron temperature , @xmath8 is the constant background density , and @xmath9 is the ion rest mass .",
    "the electric field @xmath10 has been normalized according to @xmath11 , while the density @xmath12 is normalized by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electron mass .",
    "the coordinates have been rescaled using @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron plasma frequency and @xmath18 is the electron debye length . as @xmath19 , we regain the classical zakharov equations from ( [ eq : eqs ] ) .",
    "however , in some astrophysical plasmas , the quantum parameter @xmath20 may approach unity , since in such environments , high densities are not uncommon ( see , e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "we see that the effect of the quantum parameter is to introduce higher order dispersion .",
    "the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function , as given for the electric field by @xmath21 was introduced by wigner @xcite in quantum statistical mechanics . here",
    "the angular brackets denotes the ensemble average , and the asterisk denotes the complex conjugation operation .",
    "the wigner function @xmath22 is a generalized distribution function , which satisfies @xmath23 applying the transformation ( [ eq : wigner ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : langmuir ] ) gives the kinetic equation @xcite @xmath24 which is coupled to the ion - acoustic equation ( [ eq : ion ] ) via eq .",

    "the @xmath25-operator is defined by its taylor expansion , and arrows denote direction of operation . keeping the lowest order derivative in this taylor expansion , corresponding to the long wavelength limit , gives a modified vlasov equation @xmath26 for the quantum langmuir wave , driven by the ion - acoustic ponderomotive force . here",

    "becomes @xmath35\\left [ \\omega^2   - ( 1 + h^2k^2)^2k^4 \\right ]    = 2i_0(1 + h^2k^2)k^4 , \\ ] ] such that @xmath36 , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the coherent monoenergetic background distribution gives important information on wave instabilities .",
    "however , in many applications the background field is not fully coherent , but rather displays partial decoherence due to , e.g.  noise .",
    "the noise , either classical or quantum , may stem from different sources , such as thermal effects , weak turbulence , or quantum fluctuations .",

    "we note that as @xmath55 , we regain the monoenergetic dispersion relation ( [ eq : monodisp ] ) .",
    "if @xmath19 , we obtain the classical limit of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : newdisprel ] ) , when we use a kinetic photon description for the langmuir waves .",
    "the effects of statistical broadening on the zakharov system was also analyzed in ref .  .",
    "we note that the two complex poles approaches infinity , and only the real pole remains with the value @xmath56 , as it should .",

    "the growth rate has a linear dependence on the wavenumber , the slope being determined by the values of the width @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath20 is nonzero , the combined effects of quantum correction and decoherence make themselves apparent in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : newdisprel ] ) through new and novel wave modes . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : quantum ] ) we display the growth rate @xmath61 as a function of the wave number @xmath62 . as",
    "compared to the classical case , the combined effect of partial coherence and quantum effects , i.e.  finite @xmath46 and @xmath20 respectively , is to make the modulational instability growth rate smaller for long wavelength perturbations . however , the interesting effect is for short wavelengths , where the modes introduced due the finite spectral width is amplified by the quantum corrections .",
    "thus , we may expect much stronger growth rates for short wavelength perturbations , making these dominant in quantum plasmas . in fig .",
    "[ fig : quantum ] the dispersion curves for a value @xmath63 of the quantum parameter has been plotted .",
    "the strong growth rate for short wavelengths can clearly be seen .",
    "the effects of partial coherence in quantum plasmas , such as in the form of a random phase , is of interest in certain plasmas , such as astrophysical plasmas @xcite , and the next generation laser plasma systems @xcite .",
