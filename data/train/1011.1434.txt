    "due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of strong interactions @xcite strong constraints among the interactions between the lightest pseudoscalars arise , which are most efficiently derived in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite . for the isospin ( @xmath7 ) 0 ,",
    "1 and 1/2 the scattering of the pseudoscalars in s - wave is strong enough to generate dynamically the lightest scalar resonances , namely , the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as shown in refs .",
    "still one can make use of the tightly constrained interactions among the lightest pseudoscalars in order to work out approximately the scattering between the latter mesons and scalar resonances , as we show below .",
    "we concentrate here on the much narrower resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 and consider their interactions with the pseudoscalars @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if these interactions are strong enough new pseudoscalar resonances with @xmath14 would come up .",
    "this is the case and the resulting pseudoscalar resonances have a mass larger than 1  gev ( this energy limit is close to the masses of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , typically following the relevant scalar - pseudoscalar thresholds .    the problem of the excited pseudoscalars above 1  gev is interesting by itself . these resonances are not typically well - known @xcite . in @xmath15",
    "one has the @xmath2 and @xmath16 resonances .",
    "the @xmath17 resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 are somewhat better known @xcite .",
    "they are broad resonances with a large uncertainty in the width of the former , which is reported to range between 200 - 600  mev in the pdg @xcite .",
    "some controversy exists for interpreting the decay channels of the @xmath4 within a quarkonium picture @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that together with the second radial excitation of the pion there would be a hybrid resonance somewhat higher in mass @xcite .",
    "special mention deserves the @xmath18 channel where the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 have been object of an intense theoretical and experimental study . for an exhaustive review on the experiments performed on these resonances and the nearby @xmath21 axial - vector resonance @xmath22 see ref .",
    "experimentally it has been established that while the @xmath20 decays mainly to @xmath23 the @xmath5 decays to @xmath24 @xcite . in this way , the study of the @xmath25 system is certainly the most adequate one for isolating the @xmath20 resonance because both the @xmath22 and @xmath5 have a suppressed partial decay width to this channel @xcite",
    "@xcite favor the interpretation of considering the @xmath19 and @xmath5 as ideally mixed states ( because the @xmath19 and the @xmath3 are close in mass ) of the same nonet of pseudoscalar resonances with the other members being the @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "all these resonances would be the first radial excitation of the lightest pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 would then be an extra state in this classification whose clear signal in gluon - rich process , like @xmath26 @xcite or @xmath27 radiative decays @xcite , and its absence in @xmath28 collision @xcite , would favor its interpretation as a glueball in qcd @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation opens in turn a serious problem because present results from lattice qcd predict the lowest mass for the pseudoscalar glueball at around 2.4  gev @xcite .",
    "given the success of the lattice qcd prediction for the lightest scalar glueball , with a mass at around 1.7  gev @xcite , this discrepancy for the pseudoscalar channel would be quite exciting .",
    "qcd sum rules @xcite give a mass for the lightest pseudoscalar gluonium of @xmath29  gev and an upper bound of @xmath30  gev . however , the @xmath20 would fit as a @xmath31 glueball if the latter is a closed gluonic fluxtube @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has also been pointed out that the mass and properties of the @xmath20 are consistent with predictions for a gluino - gluino bound state @xcite .",
    "the previous whole picture for classifying the lightest pseudoscalar resonances has been challenged in ref .",
    "the authors question the existence of the @xmath19 and argue that , due to a node in the @xmath32 wave function of the @xmath5 @xcite , only one isoscalar pseudoscalar resonance in the 1.4 - 1.5  gev region exists .",
    "this node shifts the resonant peak position depending on the channel , @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "it has been also recently observed by the bes collaboration the resonance @xmath6 with quantum numbers favored as a pseudoscalar @xmath31 resonance both in @xmath33 @xcite and in @xmath34 @xcite . for the former decay ref .",
    "@xcite offers an alternative explanation in terms of the @xmath26 final state interactions .",
    "we consider here the s - wave interactions between the scalar resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the approach followed is an extended version of the one that refs .",
    "@xcite applied to study the s - wave interactions of the @xmath35 with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances , respectively .",
    "we show that the interactions derived generate resonances dynamically that can be associated with many of the previous pseudoscalar resonances listed above , namely , with the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this way",
    ", new contributions to the physical resonant signals result from this novel mechanism not explored so far .",
    "in addition , we also study other exotic channels and find that the @xmath36 @xmath37 channel could also be resonant .    after this introduction we present the formalism and derive the s - wave scattering amplitudes for scalar - pseudoscalar interactions in section [ sec2 ] .",

    "the basic point is that this diagram is enhanced because the masses of both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are very close to the @xmath41 threshold . in this way , for scattering near the threshold of the reaction ,",
