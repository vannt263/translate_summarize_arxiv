    "elliptical and s0 galaxies are luminous sources in the x - ray sky ( e.g. , forman et al . 1985 ) .",
    "in terms of their x - ray - to - optical luminosity ratios , these early - type galaxies can generally be divided into two categories : x - ray bright galaxies and x - ray faint galaxies .",
    "both x - ray faint and x - ray bright galaxies reveal a hard x - ray component whose intensity is roughly proportional to the optical luminosity of the galaxy . in x - ray bright early - type galaxies , the hard spectral component",
    "is often overwhelmed by the emission of the hot diffuse gas .",
    "however the hard x - ray component appears to be significant in x - ray faint galaxies and , in some cases , dominates the x - ray spectrum .",
    "trinchieri and fabbiano ( 1985 ) and other later studies of the non - thermal emission ascribed it to the contribution of a large number of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , such as observed in the bulges of m31 and our galaxy ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "1995 ) . with the advent of the high spatial resolution observations of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ,",
    "hundreds of point sources have been resolved in a number of nearby elliptical and s0 galaxies and the lmxb - origin has been confirmed ( e.g. , sarazin et al . 2000 ) .",
    "most of the resolved x - ray point sources in early - type galaxies are likely lmxbs and they may be useful in deciphering the evolutionary history of their host galaxies and stars therein , and constraining our understanding of the physics of compact stars . in the past few years",
    "_ chandra _ observations have revealed that the x - ray luminosities of the resolved point sources in early type galaxies span a wide range from the typical observational limit of a few @xmath9 erg s@xmath3 to over @xmath7 erg s@xmath3 ( e.g. , sarazin et al . 2000 ; angelini et al .",
    "2001 ; kundu et al .",
    "the observed xlfs show quite similar , but not exactly the same profiles among galaxies .",
    "for example , in ngc 4697 , sarazin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported that there is a knee on the xlf at around the eddington luminosity of normal accreting neutron stars with a mass @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ergs s@xmath3 ) , and thus suggested that the break might be an universal feature that can be used as a distance indicator .",
    "the existence of a similar break was confirmed by kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in ngc 4472 and by blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in ngc 1553 .",
    "however , by analyzing a sample of 14 e / s0 galaxies , kim and fabbiano ( 2004 ) argued that the position of the break is significantly higher than @xmath12 of normal neutron stars . in ngc 720 ,",
    "jeltema et al . ( 2003 ) showed an even higher break at @xmath13 ergs s@xmath3 ( although this is based on a distance derived from an adopted @xmath14 of 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "similar breaks or upper cutoffs at substantially high luminosities have been found by sivakoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in ngc 4365 and ngc 4382 , and by jord@xmath15n et al .",

    "moreover , in ngc 1600 sivakoff et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the break is not needed to fit the observed xlf .",
    "the obvious disagreements between these works cast doubts on the feasibility of using @xmath16 as a reliable standard candle for distance determinations .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been revealed that in early - type galaxies about 4% of the gcs host bright lmxbs , and about 1870% of the resolved lmxbs are found to be associated with gcs with a preference on the optically brighter and redder ones ( e.g. , kundu et al .",
    "2002 ; sarazin et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2003 ) . in most cases ,",
    "such a correlation with color is attributed to metallicity ( kundu et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these results imply that gcs are an efficient breeding ground for lmxbs , as it is true in our own galaxy ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) .",
    "the origin of the lmxbs that are not associated with gcs ( field lmxbs ) is still unclear .",
    "it has been speculated in many published papers ( e.g. , kundu et al .",
    "2002 , maccarone et al 2003 ) that the majority of them may be an ejected gc population , or have been left in the field after gc disaggregation .",
    "still , the possibility that they are a true field population and were actually formed in situ can not be ruled out at present ( maccarone et al .",
    "the comparisons between the x - ray properties of the gc lmxbs and field lmxbs should help answer the question . as of today",
    ", it appears that in some cases the difference between the spectra of gc lmxbs and field lmxbs is almost undistinguishable in the x - ray band , strongly supporting a similar origin .",

    "it is usually classified as an elliptical galaxy , although in some cases ( e.g. , ferrari et al .",

    "hst _ observations show that from 1991 to 1996 the intensity of the central , unresolved source of this galaxy changed by a factor of several in the near uv band , along with the appearance of some uv / optical emission lines ( renzini et al .",
    "1995 ; cappellari et al .",
    "this indicates that ngc 4552 harbors a mini - agn at the center , as has been inferred in the x - ray band by colbert and mushotzky ( 1999 ) who studied the nuclear source with _",

    "we quote errors at the 90% confidence level unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "ngc 4552 was observed on april 2223 , 2001 with the ccd 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 and 8 of the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) for a total exposure of 56.8 ks .",
    "the center of the galaxy was positioned on the acis s3 chip ( ccd 7 ) with an offset of @xmath19 from the nominal pointing for the s3 chip , so the entire galaxy was covered by the s3 chip .",
    "the ccd temperature was @xmath20c .",
    "the events were telemetried in the very faint mode , and the data were collected with frame times of 3.1 s. in the analysis that follows , we used the ciao 2.3 software to process the data acquired from the s3 chip only . in order to use the latest calibration",
    ", we started with the level-1 data .",
    "we only kept events with _",
    "grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 , and removed bad pixels , bad columns , and columns adjacent to bad columns and node boundaries . in order to identify occasional intervals of high background ( `` background flares '' ) , whose effects are particularly significant on the backside - illuminated s1 and s3 chips , we extracted and examined lightcurves of the background regions on the s3 chip in 2.57 kev where the background flares are expected to be most visible .",
    "we found that the detected intervals contaminated by the particle events that raise the count rate to over 20% more than its mean value is less than 9% of the total exposure .",
    "we have excluded these intervals and used a net exposure time of 52.2 ks in our analysis .",

    "= @xmath23 ) .",
    "we limited the spectral analysis to the @xmath24 kev energy band in order to avoid the effects of calibration uncertainties at lower energies and instrumental background at higher energies .",
    "we extracted all of the spectra in the pulse height - invariant ( pi ) channels , and performed model fittings with xspec v11.2.0 .",
    "because there has been a continuous degradation in the acis quantum efficiency ( qe ) since launch , we applied acisabs to correct the created arf files before using them to fit the spectra .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the raw _ chandra _ image of ngc 4552 in 0.310 kev , which has not been corrected for either exposure or background . for a comparison ,",
    "we overlap the dss optical intensity contours on the x - ray image .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the spatial distribution of the x - ray emissions is nearly symmetric within about 9@xmath25 ( 0.7 kpc ) . outside the nuclear region",
    "the distribution of the x - rays is elongated roughly in the north - south direction out to about 50@xmath25 ( 4.1 kpc ) , where it does not follow the profile of the optical light . in the region about @xmath26 east of the center",
    "there is a lack of diffuse x - ray emission . in figure 2 , we show the smoothed x - ray image with a minimum significance of 3 and a maximum significance of 5 . in the figure we use a large circle to indicate the region within the 4 effective radii ( 4 @xmath0 ) , where 1 @xmath27 or 2.4 kpc ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the locations of the detected x - ray point sources are also marked , which show a clear tendency to concentrate toward the center .",
    "the details of the detection and analysis of these point sources are presented in  4 .",
    "there is a lack of diffuse x - rays in the region about @xmath26 east of the center , while the region about @xmath28 south - west of the center lacks bright x - ray point sources .",
    "we find that the _ chandra _ x - ray position of the central point source ( src 1 ; see  4.6 ) , the brightest one in the field as well as the peak of the diffuse x - ray emission , coincides with the optical / ir center of the galaxy ( monet et al .",
    "1998 ; cutri et al .",

    "this is the x - ray counterpart of the mini - agn identified through its uv / optical activity ( cappellari et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we do notice that by using the _ rosat _ hri data colbert and mushotzky ( 1999 ) reported an offset of @xmath30 between the position of the compact x - ray source in the nuclear region and the position of the optical photometric center of the galaxy .",
    "but since this offset is much smaller than the uncertainty of the _ rosat _ hri positioning , which is typically @xmath31 , our results are not in conflict .",
    "moreover , the _ chandra _ x - ray position of the central source is also in good agreement with the position of the central radio source ( nagar et al .",

    "we detected x - ray point sources on the acis s3 image using the ciao tool celldetect .",
    "the default signal - to - noise threshold for source detection was set to be 3 , and the energy range used for detection was restricted to 0.310 kev for better statistics .",
    "we have cross - checked the results both by using the ciao tool wavdetect and by eye in either the 0.310 kev or 0.77 kev images .",
    "we detected a total of 79 sources that exceeded the detection threshold .",
    "of these , 47 lie within the 4 @xmath0 region .",
    "we estimate that the minimum detection for a point source is approximately @xmath33 counts s@xmath3 ( 16 counts for 52.2 ks ) at @xmath34 .",
    "notice that this value is higher than that in sivakoff et al .",

    "are clearly fake because the photon distribution within the detection cell does not follow that of a point source . considering the large uncertainties due to the sample incompleteness for very faint sources , in this paper we conservatively adopt a signal - to - noise threshold of 3 and focus our study on the 47 sources within the 4 @xmath0 region .",
    "we list the properties of all 47 sources in table 1 , where we sort them in the order of increasing projected distance _",
    "d _ from the center of the galaxy .",
    "we arrange the columns as follows : ( 1 ) source number ; ( 2)-(3 ) : right ascension and declination ( j2000 ) ; ( 4 ) projected distance _",

    "the extractions were made in 0.310 kev for better statistics , since we found that after correcting for the background the results obtained in this energy band are consistent with those obtained in 0.77 kev .",
    "we calculated the kolmogoroff - smirov ( ks ) statistic for each of the lightcurves against the null hypothesis that the count rate of the source plus the background is uniform over the effective exposure time . if the count rate is temporally invariant , the cumulative fraction of the count is expected to be a diagonal from 0 to 1 .",
    "we find that two sources , src 15 ( 174 counts ) and src 28 ( 107 counts ) , have a less than 5% probability of being invariable . in order to examine",
    "if these results are caused by local background fluctuations , we also applied the ks test to the lightcurves extracted from the background regions adjacent to the two sources . in neither case",
    "can we find any significant temporal variability in the background .",
    "therefore , we conclude that both sources are intrinsically variable . assuming that they are at the distance of ngc 4552 and using the best - fit absorbed power - law spectral model for all the resolved sources (  4.4 )",
    ", we estimate that src 15 and src 28 have luminosities of @xmath38 ergs s@xmath3 and @xmath39 ergs s@xmath3 , respectively . in figure 3",
    ", we present their background - corrected lightcurves that show clear variations on @xmath40 hr timescales , together with the lightcurve of the central source ( src 1 ) , which is the brightest one in the field . in terms of the ks test , the temporal variability of src 1 is less significant than src 15 and src 28 .",
    "this is likely because k - s tests are most sensitive around the median value of the independent variable . however",
    ", a visual examination of the lightcurve suggests that it is variable on timescales of about 1 hr or more , with flux variations of about @xmath41 .",
    "we attempted fourier analysis techniques to detect any potential periods on minute - hour timescales for src 1 , 15 and 28 .",
    "no statistically meaningful periodicity is found in any of the sources .",
    "as the count rates of the resolved point sources are typically quite low directly analyzing the spectrum of the sources by fitting models is not practical .",
    "instead we study the hardness ratios .",
    "following sarazin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and other authors , we measured the background - subtracted counts for each of the 47 resolved sources in three energy bands : soft ( s ) , 0.31.0 kev ; medium ( m ) , 1.02.0 kev ; and hard ( h ) , 2.010.0 kev and calculated the hardness ratios r21 and r31 using the definitions r21 = ( m @xmath42 s)/(m + s ) and r31 = ( h @xmath42 s)/(h + s ) , respectively .",
    "we list the calculated hardness ratios and their 1@xmath43 errors , which are very large in general , in columns 8 and 9 of table 1 , and plot r31 versus r21 for all the sources in figure 4 .",
    "only the typical 1@xmath43 error bars are illustrated in order not to complicate the figure . in the same figure",
    ", we also show the predicted hardness ratios for an absorbed power - law model with different column densities @xmath44 and photon indices @xmath45 . it can be seen in that most of the sources",
    "are located in a diagonal band from ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) to ( + 0.757 , + 0.837 ) .",
    "we note that these colors are similar to those found in the x - ray bright elliptical galaxy ngc 720 ( jeltema et al . 2003 ) and ngc 4649 ( randall et al .",
    "irwin 2004 ) .",
    "three sources , i.e. , src 17 ( + 0.678 , + 0.372 ) , src 31 ( + 0.757 , + 0.837 ) , and src 45 ( + 0.702 , + 0.436 ) , appear to have been absorbed by a column density larger than the galactic value . since they are all located far away from the center of the galaxy ( @xmath48 ) , they are probably unrelated background agns . however , we find that the hardness ratios of src 17 and src 45 can not be reproduced by using a simple absorbed power - law spectral model , which is not in agreement with the spectrum of the hard x - ray cosmic background ( mushotzky et al .",
    "the brightest source in the field ( src 1 ) is located at the nucleus of the galaxy and has the x - ray color ( r21 , r31 ) = ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "unlike in ngc 720 ( jeltema et al .",
    "2003 ) and ngc 4649 ( randall et al . 2004 ) , we found no supersoft sources ( ssss ) in ngc 4552 . within the 4 @xmath0 region",
    "the total x - ray emission ( diffuse emission plus all the resolved point sources ) of the galaxy has a hardness ratio of ( r21 , r31 ) = ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , as compared to the ( r21 , r31 ) = ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) hardness ratio for the resolved sources and ( r21 , r31 ) = ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) for the unresolved diffuse emission from the gas plus unresolved point sources ( see also  4.4 ) .      within the 4 @xmath0 region ,",
    "there are 12 x - ray point sources ( src 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 24 , 28 , 37 , 41 , 43 and 46 ) each having more than 100 counts . we have extracted and studied the individual spectra of these bright sources . among them , src 1 is the brightest and coincides with the mini - agn identified in the uv / optical bands ( cappellari et al .",
    "we will present detailed analysis of its spectrum separately in  4.6 .",
    "we divide the rest of sources with less than 100 counts into four groups ( table 2 ) .",
    "sources in group a are the hardest ones that appeared at the top of figure 4 .",
    "sources in group b are those for which the galactic column density is required when an absorbed power - law model is applied to describe their hardness ratios , while for sources in group c a larger column density is needed .",
    "the rest of the sources are in group d. we have extracted and studied the cumulative spectra of each of the four groups , as well as that of all the resolved sources ( excluding src 1 ) . in the model fittings , the background spectra were extracted from the local background fields adjacent to the regions where the source spectra were extracted .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "as can be seen , excluding the central source , the cumulative spectrum of all resolved sources within the 4 @xmath0 region can be fitted best by an absorbed power - law model with a photon index of @xmath57 when the column density is fixed to the galactic value .",
    "the deduced intrinsic luminosity of all the resolved sources in 0.310 kev is @xmath58 ergs s@xmath3 , assuming that the sources are all at the distance of ngc 4552 .",
    "we also attempted to separate the emission of the unresolved point sources from the hot diffuse gas . in order to do this",
    "we extracted the spectrum of the total diffuse emission by excluding all resolved point sources .",
    "the background for this spectrum was extracted on the s3 chip as far away as possible from the galaxy . to fit the spectrum",
    ", we used a thermal component ( apec model ) to represent the contribution of the hot plasma , and a non - thermal component ( power - law model ) to represent the emission from the unresolved point sources , under the assumption that the hard spectral component seen in the diffuse emission is mainly due to the lmxbs .",
    "both spectral components are subjected to a common absorption @xmath44 . because we find that when @xmath44 is free the obtained value is only slightly lower than , but still consistent with the galactic value , we simply fix @xmath44 to the galactic value .",
    "we fixed the power - law photon index of the hard component to the value of 1.56 measured for the cumulative spectrum of all resolved sources ; allowing the photon index to vary did not improve the fit .",
    "the best - fit gas temperature is found at @xmath59 kev , and the calculated luminosity of the total diffuse emission in 0.310 kev is @xmath60 ergs s@xmath3 , of which about 31% , or @xmath61 ergs s@xmath3 , can be ascribed to the unresolved point sources .",
    "if calculated in count flux , the contribution of the unresolved sources is about 20% .",
    "thus , by adding the emissions of both resolved and unresolved point sources together , we estimate that in 0.310 kev the lmxbs contribute about 48% of the galaxy s total luminosity , or about @xmath62 of the total count flux .",
    "next we fit the cumulative spectra of the four groups of resolved point sources with an absorbed power - law model and list the results in table 2 .",
    "we find that for group a the obtained photon index is @xmath63 if the column density is fixed to the galactic value .",
    "the goodness of fit is marginally acceptable at @xmath64 .",
    "when we allow the column density to vary , the fit can be improved significantly ( @xmath65 ) in terms of the f - test which yields a best - fit photon index of @xmath66 , and a large absorption of @xmath67 @xmath37 .",
    "the spectra of group b and c can be well fit by the absorbed power - law model with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , when @xmath44 is fixed to the galactic value for group b and allowed to vary for group c. the spectrum of group d appears to be complicated and can not be easily explained by using an one - component spectral model .",
    "based on the best - fit power - law model for the cumulative spectrum of all resolved sources within the 4 @xmath0 region ( excluding the central source ; @xmath70 ) , we convert the observed count rates of the 46 off - center sources into unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosities , assuming that the sources are all at the distance of ngc 4552 .",

    "we also have attempted to fit the corrected xlf with a cutoff power - law model .",
    "whether or not the incompleteness correction is made , we find that the model gives poor fit to the data and actually can be rejected at the 90% confidence level .",
