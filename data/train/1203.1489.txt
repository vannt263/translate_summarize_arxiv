    "a common approach to explain the observed hierarchies in fermion masses and mixings is in terms of flavour symmetries .",
    "the matter fields transform under the flavour symmetry , which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of scalar fields that we will call flavons in the following .",
    "most yukawa couplings are forbidden at the renormalisable level and only arise from higher - dimensional operators involving suitable powers of the flavons as determined by the flavour symmetry @xcite .",
    "the flavour hierarchies are then explained by small order parameters given by the ratio of flavon vev and the uv cutoff scale .",
    "this scale itself remains undetermined and can in principle be as large as the planck scale . in case",
    "it is smaller , one can interpret this cutoff scale as the typical mass scale of new degrees of freedom , the so - called `` flavour messengers '' .",
    "the dynamics of this sector may have important impact on low - energy physics even if its characteristic scale is very high . in this work",
    "we want to systematically analyse the structure of the messenger sector and show that it can indeed have important consequences both for yukawa couplings and soft masses in the mssm .    in the uv completion that contains the messenger sector , small fermion masses",
    "can be thought to arise from small mixing of light fields either with heavy fermions or with heavy scalars . in the first case , which has been studied extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite , fermion masses correspond to three light eigenvalues of a large mass matrix . in the second case ,",
    "light masses arise from small vevs of the heavy scalars .",
    "this latter case has received less attention despite its structure is much simpler .",
    "such scalar messengers are very suitable to generate texture zeros in the yukawa matrix @xcite , that is , the vanishing of certain entries although allowed by the flavour symmetry .",
    "independently of the kind of messengers , in general one needs many of them .",
    "since these fields carry sm quantum numbers , they contribute to the rg evolution of sm gauge couplings .",
    "the requirement of maintaining perturbativity up to certain scale puts a lower bound on the messenger masses as a function of their number . in this work",
    "we require perturbative physics up to a very high scale of supersymmetry breaking mediation , the planck scale for gravity mediation or the gauge mediation scale . in consequence",
    "the flavour messengers must be very heavy .",
    "direct effects of their exchange are then strongly suppressed , but , when the flavour messenger scale is lower than the susy breaking mediation scale , they are relevant for the flavour dependence of the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "this is because in the supersymmetric theories we are considering the soft susy breaking terms are sensitive to any dynamics that couple to light fields .",
    "one can distinguish tree - level effects on the soft mass terms , generated by integrating out the flavour messengers and determined by the flavour symmetry alone  @xcite , and radiative effects summarised by the rg evolution between the susy breaking mediation scale @xmath1 and flavour messenger scale @xmath0 , with the flavour messengers included .",
    "the latter are particularly interesting as they necessarily break flavour universality of soft terms , even if it is assumed ( or naturally present ) as the initial condition at @xmath1 .",
    "we quantitatively estimate these effects and show that they always give in the super - ckm basis flavour off - diagonal terms in soft masses comparable ( in their order of magnitude ) to those one would obtain at tree - level without assuming universality .",
    "thus the evolution of the soft terms according to the mfv hypothesis  @xcite from their initial universal values is possible only if @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 . for gravity mediation , the flavour physics",
    "is then pushed to the planck scale .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : in section 2 we first discuss the general structure of the messenger sector , in particular the two possibilities of uv completions with heavy fermions and heavy scalars , respectively .",
    "this allows us to estimate the typical number of messengers that we use in section 3 to calculate the bounds on the messenger scale from perturbativity . in section 4",
    "we discuss the impact of the messenger sector on the flavour structure of soft terms .",
    "in particular we present constraints on light rotation angles valid in large classes of flavour models .",
    "we finally conclude in section 5 . in the appendix we provide explicit examples of uv completions of three popular flavour models in the literature in order to illustrate our general discussion .",
    "we want to consider models with a general flavour symmetry group @xmath10 spontaneously broken by the vevs of the flavon superfields @xmath11 .",
    "the mssm yukawa couplings arise from higher - dimensional @xmath10 invariant operators involving the flavons @xmath12 where the suppression scale @xmath13 is the typical scale of the flavour sector dynamics .",
    "the coefficients of the effective operators are assumed to be @xmath14 , so that yukawa hierarchies arise exclusively from the small order parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the transformation properties of the mssm fields and the flavons under @xmath10 are properly chosen , so that @xmath16 together with their exponents @xmath17 reproduce the observed hierarchies of fermion masses and mixings .    in order to uv - complete these models one has to `` integrate in '' heavy fields at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "these messenger fields are vectorlike and charged under @xmath10 .",
    "they couple to the flavons and the light matter . in the fundamental theory",
    "they mix either with mssm matter or higgs fields ( after flavour symmetry breaking ) . in the first case one",
    "has to introduce chiral superfields @xmath18 with the quantum numbers of the mssm matter fields ( see fig .",
    "[ fchain ] ) .",
    "schematic supergraph for fermion uvc.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in the second case one introduces chiral fields @xmath19 with the quantum numbers of the mssm higgs fields and @xmath20-even gauge singlets , respectively ( see fig .  [ hchain ] ) .",
    "schematic supergraph for higgs uvc.,scaledwidth=92.0% ]    we are now going to discuss in more detail these two possibilities , to which we refer as  fermion uv completion \" ( fuvc ) and  higgs uv completion \" ( huvc ) .",
    "although we restrict to the pure cases , a uv completion involving both kind of fields is also viable .",
    "such a case is a straightforward generalisation of the following discussion .      in order to uv -",
    "complete the effective theory above with fermionic messengers , one has to introduce certain numbers of vector - like superfields with light fermion quantum numbers @xmath21 with superpotential interactions of the schematic form @xmath22 where we restricted to the up - sector for simplicity .",
    "moreover we have dropped all couplings that are assumed to be @xmath14 , since all hierarchies should arise from the symmetry breaking alone ( which also implies @xmath23 ) .",
    "the allowed couplings follow directly from the transformation properties of the messengers under @xmath10 .",
    "they have to be chosen appropriately , such that the effective yukawa couplings in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) are generated upon integrating out the messengers .",
    "this choice can be conveniently carried out by drawing tree - level feynman diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ fchain ] , in which a given yukawa entry @xmath24 is induced by the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ flavonint ] ) with the number of flavon insertions given by @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) .",
    "the diagram dictates the required messenger couplings and therefore their @xmath10 quantum numbers . in the following",
    ", we are going to refer to these diagrams as `` chain '' diagrams , for which we introduce the shorthand notation :    @xmath26    notice that for generating a yukawa entry with a given number of flavon insertions one can write several chain diagrams using different messengers .",
    "this ambiguity arises from the possible permutations of the higgs and flavon insertions in fig .",
    "[ fchain ] .",
    "for instance , one can choose the position of the higgs insertion , which corresponds to the number of  left - handed \" ( @xmath27 ) and  right - handed \" ( @xmath28 ) messengers one wants to use .",
    "in particular it is possible to use only left - handed or right - handed messengers .",
    "all entries of the light yukawas can then be generated using the chain diagrams . to be economic",
    "one can use the same messengers for different chains , but one has to pay attention that the resulting yukawa matrix has full rank , which might not be the case because of possible correlations of different entries . an elegant and simple way to find the minimal number ( meaning minimal number of sm representations ) of messengers needed in each sector",
    "was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the full theory",
    "the role of the messenger couplings in eq .",
    "( [ flavonint ] ) is to generate three light eigenvalues of the full mass matrix that involves the chiral fields and the vectorlike messengers .",
    "since the heavy eigenvalues are @xmath29 , the determinant of the full mass matrix must be equal to the determinant of the light mass matrix , up to powers of @xmath0 : @xmath30 because every entry of the full mass matrix involves at most one power of @xmath11 , one needs at least @xmath31 messengers with @xmath32 that is , the minimum number of messengers can be found simply by counting the powers of @xmath16 in the determinant of the yukawa matrix .    although this argument gives the minimal number of messengers , it is unclear which messengers have to be included .",
    "we therefore outline a simple , model - independent , procedure to derive minimal sets of fermionic messengers for each sector .",
    "one first identifies the three entries of the effective yukawa matrix that gives the leading order contribution to the determinant .",
    "if the leading order determinant is the sum of several terms one can choose any of the summands . then one constructs the chain diagrams for the three chosen entries using different messengers for different entries , even if they have the same quantum numbers . in this way one",
    "adds a total number of messengers that is precisely @xmath31 .",
    "usually there are several solutions obtained from permuting the higgs and flavon insertions in each diagram . by counting the total number of these permutations for each of the three entries",
    "one can easily find the total number of possible uv completions with minimal number of fermionic messengers . in appendix",
    "a we explicitly construct the fermion messenger sector for three examples in order to illustrate the general procedure .",
    "the above method guarantees that the resulting yukawa matrices are full - rank , i.e.  all fermion masses are generated . in general it does not ensure that other yukawa entries besides the three chosen , and therefore the correct mixings , are generated as well .",
    "however , we checked that this is the case for the three example models of appendix a.    finally we want to elucidate the necessity of using different messengers for different entries .",
    "let us assume that two yukawa entries @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , contribute at leading order to the determinant and arise from chains that share a messenger .",
    "one can then integrate out all messengers but this one .",
    "the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ flavonint ] ) reduces to the following form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are some effective couplings involving appropriate powers of @xmath16 . by integrating out the last messenger",
    "@xmath39 one clearly obtains a rank 1 matrix ( see the diagram below ) .",
    "one can avoid this by introducing a copy of @xmath39 , i.e.  a new messenger @xmath40 with the same quantum numbers as @xmath39 .",
    "this gives rise to a new contribution to the effective superpotential @xmath41 which ensures that the effective yukawa matrix for @xmath42 and @xmath43 has rank 2 .",
    "we now discuss the uv completion of flavour models with heavy higgs fields .",
    "in general one has to introduce certain numbers of vector - like superfields @xmath44 where @xmath45 has the sm quantum number of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a gauge singlet .",
    "the superpotential interactions are of the schematic form @xmath48 again we dropped all couplings that are assumed to be @xmath14 and take @xmath49 .",
    "the required couplings and therefore the transformation properties of the messengers under @xmath10 can be inferred from chain diagrams like in fig .",
    "[ hchain ] .",
    "note that for generating all yukawa entries , in general corresponding to different charges , one needs different higgs fields coupling to @xmath50 for each @xmath51 . for generating a yukawa entry in general one can write several diagram with different messengers , corresponding to the possible permutations of higgs and flavon insertion in fig .",
    "[ hchain ] .",
    "in particular , it is possible to use only @xmath45 messengers and avoid gauge singlets .",
    "explicit examples with huvc can be found in appendix a.    in the fundamental theory , small fermion masses arise from small vevs of the @xmath45 messengers .",
    "these vevs can be calculated by setting the messenger f - terms to zero and using the mssm higgs vev @xmath52 as a background value .",
    "solving the f - term equations @xmath53 is then equivalent to integrating out the messengers by their susy equations of motion .",
    "this is analogous to the supersymmetric type - ii see - saw @xcite , where integrating out the heavy triplet or computing the vev of its scalar component are two equivalent ways to compute the effective neutrino masses .",
    "notice that the interpretation of small fermion masses in the fundamental theory is much easier for the higgs uvc , since the calculation is formally the same as in the effective theory , while in the fermion messenger case one would have to diagonalise huge mass matrices .",
    "this feature of huvcs allows to enforce texture zeros in the yukawa matrices in a very simple way .",
    "although a certain yukawa entry would be allowed by the flavour symmetry , one can set it to zero because of particular dynamics in the messenger sector . from fig .",
    "[ hchain ] it is clear that a specific yukawa entry can only arise if the corresponding coupling to a heavy higgs is present . if such a higgs with the correct transformation properties under @xmath10 is missing , the entry vanishes in the fundamental theory and remains zero in the low - energy effective theory . this elegant possibility to produce",
    "texture zeros has been already outlined in  @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we illustrate this for the case of a u(1 ) flavour model .",
    "as we have seen , the strongly hierarchical pattern of fermion masses requires a large number of messengers with sm quantum numbers .",
    "these fields have a strong impact on the running of the sm gauge couplings , so that for a given messenger sector the messenger mass scale can not be too far below the cutoff scale in order to avoid landau poles .",
    "if the messengers are coloured ( as in the case of fuvc ) , the strongest constraint typically arises from the running of @xmath54 which is sizable already at @xmath55 . in the case of huvc , instead the bound is set by @xmath56 and is usually weaker than in the previous case .",
    "moreover some heavy higgs fields can be replaced by heavy singlets with no impact on running of the gauge couplings .",
    "therefore one can expect that models with huvc will be less constrained than fuvc models regarding the bounds from perturbativity of gauge couplings .",
    "similarly , the messenger lagrangian contains many couplings which are @xmath14 and one has to ensure that they do not blow up in the running between the messenger scale and the cutoff .",
    "further constraints on the messenger sector finally arise when one requires that the approximate unification of gauge couplings in the mssm is not spoiled .",
    "this is easily ensured if the messenger fields from complete su(5 ) multiplets .",
    "we are now going to discuss these issues in more detail .",

    "we have analysed in detail the structure of the messenger sector of this kind of models , which contains vector - like superfields that mix either with light fermions or with light higgs fields . in the latter case",
    ", it is particularly simple to obtain texture zeros in the yukawa matrices , just by removing certain messengers from the theory , without modifying the transformation properties of the sm fields .",
    "our discussion on the structure of the messenger sector does not rely on susy and can be easily generalised to non - supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "in general , the messenger sector contains many new fields charged under the sm gauge group . as a consequence ,",
    "requiring the theory to remain perturbative up to high - energy scales forces the masses of the messengers to be far above the tev scale , typically @xmath83 gev for the example models we have considered .",
    "this implies that the messengers have no direct impact on low - energy observables .",
    "still , their presence affects the rg running of the sfermion masses .",
    "we have emphasised that the radiative generation of sfermion mass - splittings and misaligned a - terms is unavoidable whenever the flavour symmetry breaking scale is lower than the susy breaking scale , like in gravity mediation .",
    "we have quantitatively estimated this rg effect and found it comparable to the tree - level off - diagonal sfermion masses as expected by the flavour symmetry . therefore the strong flavour constraints can not be evaded even under the assumption of universal soft terms .",
    "these constraints depend only on the diagonal mass splitting and the rotation angles , and therefore apply to large classes of flavour models . in table",
    "[ absusytable ] we have provided bounds on the rotation angles of the light fermions that are valid in any abelian flavour model and can be easily extended to simple non - abelian models .",
    "we find that abelian models are strongly constrained and hence it is difficult to marry them to gravity mediation with susy at the tev scale .",
    "even though it is well - known that abelian models induce large flavour changing effects , still we find it remarkable that this remains true even under the strong assumption of universal soft masses at the susy breaking mediation scale , as a consequence of the presence of flavour messengers affecting the rg running .",
    "not surprisingly , in non - abelian models the sfermion mass - splittings can be suppressed with respect to the abelian case by small flavon vevs and ease the bounds on the rotation angles .",

    "would lead to antisymmetric yukawa matrices . ] in addition one needs three anti - triplets higgs with @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 : @xmath166 or alternatively two sexplet singlets with @xmath167 , @xmath168 : @xmath169 plus the corresponding conjugate fields .",
