    "neutron stars cool down mainly by neutrino emission from the inner layers during the first million years and subsequently by photon emission from the surface .",
    "the rate of photon emission depends on the physical properties of matter inside the star and on the magnetic field .",
    "observational inference of the thermal radiation of several old neutron stars in the x - ray band ( becker & trumper , 1997 ) , and in the uv range ( pavlov , stringfellon & cordova , 1996 ; mignani , caraveo & bignami , 1997 ) indicates much higher surface temperature as compared to the predictions of the standard cooling models .",
    "therefore additional heating mechanisms are needed in order to remove the discrepancy between the detected temperature and the theoretical models .",
    "one of the two possible mechanisms is the heat generated by the frictional energy of neutron super - fluid with normal matter in the inner crust ( shibazaki & lamb 1989 ; umeda et al .",
    "1993 ) which is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "the other mechanism of additional heating is associated with the ohmic dissipation of currents ( miralles , urpin & konenkov 1998 ) which is strongly sensitive to the configuration and strength of the magnetic field .",
    "these authors found that the ohmic dissipation produces enough heat to change the thermal evolution of neutron stars substantially at the late stage although observational data on the magnetic field evolution of isolated pulsars supports a slow decay rate .",
    "considering magnetic field configurations which are initially confined to a small part of the crust and which vanish in the stellar core , several authors ( chanmugam & sang 1989 ; urpin & muslimov 1992 ; urpin & van riper 1993 ) found that the relatively low electrical conductivity of the crustal matter causes the decay times too short to be of observational interest if the impurity content is high .",
    "sengupta ( 1997 , 1998 ) investigated the contribution of space - time curvature on the decay rate of the crustal magnetic fields in isolated neutron star by assuming a spherically symmetric stationary gravitational field .",
    "it was demonstrated clearly by sengupta ( 1998 ) that the role of impurity content which increases the decay rate is suppressed by the effect of space - time curvature . as a result ,",
    "even with high impurity content , the decay rate is significantly less at the late stage of evolution if general relativistic effects are taken into consideration .    in the present paper ,",
    "i investigate the effect of space - time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star on the rate of joule heating caused by ohmic dissipation .",
    "the basic equations that describe the magnetic field evolution and the rate of joule heating under general relativistic framework are presented in the next section . in section  3",
    "the model adopted in this investigation is described .",
    "the results are discussed in section  4 and the conclusions are drawn in section  5 .",
    "assuming hydrodynamic motions to be negligible and the anisotropy of the electrical conductivity of the crustal material is small , the induction equation in flat space - time can be written as :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the electrical conductivity .",
    "if a stationary gravitational field is taken into account , then using the covariant form of maxwell equations and the generalized ohm s law ( sengupta 1998 ) ( neglecting the displacement current and taking @xmath2 ) the corresponding induction equation in curved space - time can be derived as : @xmath3 - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\left[\\frac{c}{4\\pi}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-g } } g_{\\mu k}\\frac{1}{\\sigma u^0}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}(\\sqrt{-g } f^{\\mu i})\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are the components of the electro - magnetic field tensor , @xmath5 are the components of the four - current density , @xmath6 are the components of the four velocity of the fluid , @xmath7 are the components of space - time metric that describes the background geometry and @xmath8 here and afterwards latin indices run over spatial co - ordinates only whereas greek indices run over both time and space co - ordinates .    for the description of the background geometry",
    "i consider the exterior schwarzschild metric which is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the total gravitational mass of the core .",
    "the justification for adopting the exterior schwarzschild metric is provided in sengupta ( 1998 ) . since",
    ", the crust consists of less than a few percent of the total gravitational mass , @xmath11 can be regarded as the total mass of the star .    using the metric given in equation ( [ sch ] ) , equation ( [ gtr1 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath12.\\ ] ]    following the convention , i consider the decay of a dipolar magnetic field which has axial symmetry so that the vector potential @xmath13 may be written as @xmath14 in spherical polar co - ordinates where @xmath15 since the hydrodynamic motion is negligible so @xmath16 and the metric gives @xmath17    therefore , from equation ( [ gtr1a ] ) we obtain using the definition @xmath18 @xmath19.\\ ] ]    choosing @xmath20 for the flat space - time and @xmath21 for the curved space - time , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spherical radius and polar angle respectively one gets from equation ( [ flat ] ) and equation ( [ gtr2 ] ) @xmath24 and @xmath25= \\frac{4\\pi\\sigma}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial g(r , t)}{\\partial t}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 component of the electric current maintaining the dipolar magnetic field configuration for flat space - time is given by    @xmath27    in schwarzschild space - time geometry the above quantity can be written as : @xmath28.\\ ] ]    when transfered to a locally lorentz frame the above equation takes the following form : @xmath29.\\ ] ]    following the approach of miralles , urpin and konenkov ( 1998 ) , i neglect non - sphericity in cooling calculations and use the angle - averaged expression for joule heating .",
    "the rate of joule heating @xmath30 in flat space - time is written as : @xmath31    normalizing the function @xmath32 to its initial value at the surface @xmath33 which is related to the initial field strength at the magnetic equator @xmath34 by the relation @xmath35 , the expression for the rate of joule heating in flat space - time can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 .    similarly in curved space - time : @xmath38 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    the function @xmath39 is normalized to its initial value at the surface by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is related to the initial field strength at the magnetic equator by the expression : @xmath42\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left[\\frac{r}{m}\\ln(1-\\frac{2m}{r})+(1-\\frac{2m}{r})^{-1}+1\\right]^{-1 } \\left(1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\right)^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the present work i have assumed that the space - time metric within the crustal region and exterior to the stellar surface is the same .",
    "since there exists a plasma filled magnetosphere outside the surface of the star , one should have a time varying dipole magnetic field outside the boundary .",
    "however , the electric conductivity of the surrounding plasma is such that the time variation of the magnetic field is effectively negligible as compared to that within the crust .",
    "hence for both relativistic and non - relativistic cases , i impose the usual boundary conditions as given in urpin & muslimov ( 1992 ) .",
    "the formalisms adopted in the present work have been discussed in details by miralles , urpin & konenkov ( 1998 ) .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field in flat space - time is discussed extensively by urpin & muslimov ( 1992 ) and in curved space - time by sengupta ( 1998 ) . in the present investigation ,",
    "the gravitational mass of the star is taken to be @xmath43 .",
    "however , two different configurations for the neutron star model are adopted : one with a radius 7.35 km and the other with a radius 11 km .",
    "the first one is obtained if the equation of state of the matter inside the star is soft and the second one is obtained if it is intermediate or stiff .",
    "if one assumes the initial value of @xmath44 at @xmath45 for flat space - time , then for curved space - time ( wasserman & shapiro 1983 ; sengupta 1995 ) @xmath46.\\ ] ] this is because of the fact that any given magnetic field configuration in flat space - time is modified by the curvature of space - time produced by the gravitational field of the central object .",
    "asymptotically at a large distance @xmath47 coincides with @xmath48 .",
    "i have considered the decay of the magnetic field which initially occupies the surface layers of the crust up to a depth @xmath49 where @xmath50 , r being the radius of the star .",
    "the crustal region is considered to be extended upto @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noted that for the same value of @xmath52 , the corresponding density for the two different mass - radius configurations is different .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of space - time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star to the rate of joule heating and hence to the thermal evolution of old neutron stars .",
    "the electrical conductivity within the crust has been calculated following the approaches of urpin & van riper ( 1993 ) .",
    "the net conductivity of the crustal material at a given depth is computed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the conductivity due to electron - phonon scattering and @xmath55 is the conductivity due to electron - impurity scattering .",
    "the effect of electron - ion scattering has been neglected since the region where this effect could be important is sufficiently thin .",
    "@xmath55 is inversely proportional to the impurity parameter @xmath56 defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the number density and electric charge of background ions in the crust lattice without impurity , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the charge and density of the @xmath62-th impurity species .",
    "the summation is extended over all species of impurity .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the value of the impurity parameter @xmath56 for neutron star crust is not known at present .",
    "electron - impurity scattering becomes more important with increasing density and decreasing temperature .",
    "hence at the late stage of evolution when the temperature becomes low , the conductivity is dominated by electron - impurity scattering .",
    "the impurity parameter @xmath56 has been taken as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the evolution of the surface magnetic field normalized to its initial value for both the general relativistic and the non - relativistic cases with the standard cooling model and with the impurity parameter @xmath65 and @xmath66 are presented in figure  1 and in figure  2 respectively .    it is shown by muslimov & urpin ( 1992 ) that the field behavior is qualitatively independent of the forms of the initial configurations but the numerical results differ for various choices of the initial depth penetrated by the magnetic field . at a very early stage of evolution",
    "when the crustal matter is melted in the layers of a maximal current density , the magnetic field does not decay appreciably .",
    "after the outer crust solidifies , significant decay takes place and after 1 myr no decay occurs if the impurity content is zero .    the above scenario for flat space - time",
    "is not altered with the inclusion of general relativistic effects but significant decrease in the numerical value at the late stage of evolution is found when the effect of space - time curvature is incorporated .",
    "the impurity - electron scattering is dominant at the late stage of evolution when the crustal temperature is low . as a consequence the decay rate after @xmath67 myr changes appreciably .",
    "it should be mentioned here that at the late stage the electric conductivity becomes independent of temperature .",
    "figure  3 and figure  4 show the rate of joule heating for the flat space - time and for the curved space - time with @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively . for both the cases we notice that the rate of joule heating increases by almost one order of magnitude when the stellar radius is 7.35 km . in both the figure  3 and figure  4 the results with the stellar radius r=11 km",
    "are also presented in order to demonstrate the effect of compactness .",
    "the rate of heat production is equal to the rate of decrease of the magnetic energy which is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength at any time .",
    "figure  1 and figure  2 show that the rate of magnetic field decay decreases substantially when the effect of general relativity is incorporated . as",
    "a result one expects the rate of joule heating to be less when the effect of general relativity is incorporated .",
    "however , the rate of joule heating is very much sensitive to the configuration and strength of the initial magnetic field .",
    "the more is the initial field strength the more is the heat generated .",
    "the space - time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star changes the geometry and increases the strength of the initial magnetic field substantially . the combination of the two phenomenon , eg . , a slower decay rate but higher initial field strength , yields in an overall increase in the rate of joule heating by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "the whole purpose of this investigation is to understand the effect of strong gravitation of the neutron star .",
    "the effect of the different equation of states of matter and the effect due to the depth penetrated by the initial magnetic field have been investigated in details by miralles , urpin & konenkov ( 1998 ) .    following the approach of miralles , urpin & konenkov ( 1998 )",
    ", i consider the surface temperature to follow the equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this is valid because of the fact that except for a short initial period of 3 to 10 myr when the surface temperature is very high , approximately all heat released due to the magnetic field dissipation is emitted from the surface . at the earlier age the influence of joule",
    "heating is not important . at the late stage",
    "the surface temperature is determined by balancing the joule heating integrated over the neutron star volume with the photon luminosity .",
    "it should also be mentioned that at the late stage when electron - impurity scattering becomes dominant , the electric conductivity becomes independent of the temperature of the crust .",
    "the surface temperature with and without the effect of general relativity is presented in figure  5 and figure  6 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively with r=7.35 km . since the earlier evolution is not effected by joule heating the results",
    "are shown for the age @xmath70 yr .",
    "for comparison the surface temperature without joule heating is also presented . figure  7 and figure  8 present the same results with r=11 km .",
    "the results show that for both the cases , with or without the effect of general relativity , the surface temperature increases if the initial magnetic field strength is increased .",
    "figure  5 to figure  8 clearly show that although general relativistic effect slows down the magnetic field decay rate substantially , the change in the initial magnetic field configuration and the strength of the initial field result into an increase in the surface temperature of the star as compared to the result obtained without the effect of general relativity .",
    "although this increase is not very large , the results clearly indicates that general relativity supports joule heating in maintaining a relatively high surface temperature of old neutron stars which is consistent with observational detection .",
    "pavlov , stringfellow and cordova ( 1996 ) estimated the bolometric luminosities of three isolated pulsars , b0656 + 14 , b0950 + 08 and b1929 + 10 .",
    "becker and trumper ( 1997 ) presented the upper limit of the bolometric luminosities of several milli - second pulsars .",
    "the temperature of a pulsar can be calculated from the observed flux by assuming black - body radiation and keeping in mind the fact that the temperature as calculated in the surface is higher by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "the surface temperature of all the milli - second pulsars as presented by becker and trumper ( 1997 ) is several orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the standard cooling models .",
    "however , it is believed that the milli - second pulsars are in accretion stage .",
    "therefore they should have much higher surface temperature than that of isolated pulsars and their thermal evolution is different than that of isolated pulsar . it should be pointed out here that the impurity content does nt have any significant role at a high temperature .",
    "hence , unlike isolated pulsars , the general relativistic effects should not be significant for the case of accreting neutron stars even at the late stage of evolution .    in figure  5 to figure  8 ,",
    "i have presented the surface temperature of three isolated pulsars : b0823 + 26 , b1929 + 10 and b0950 + 08 whose bolometric luminosities are estimated from observations ( pavlov , stringfellow & cordova 1996 ; becker & trumper 1997 ) .",
    "the surface temperature of three isolated pulsars which are older than @xmath72 yrs have been considered from the above references because joule heating is important only after the age @xmath73 yrs .",
    "comparison with the theoretical models that incorporate joule heating shows that the inclusion of general relativistic effects makes the results more consistent with the observational data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the observational data provides only the upper limit of the bolometric luminosity owing to the uncertainties in the distance measure of the pulsars .",
    "considering joule heating caused by the decay of the crustal magnetic field in neutron stars to be a potential mechanism in explaining the high surface temperature detected in many old neutron stars , the effect of space - time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star on the thermal evolution is investigated . in spite of the fact that general relativity slows down the magnetic field decay rate substantially , the rate of joule heating increases almost by an order of magnitude because the initial field configuration and the field strength get modified by the space - time curvature . as a result ,",
    "general relativistic effects support joule heating in maintaining a high surface temperature at a very late stage of evolution of isolated neutron stars .",
