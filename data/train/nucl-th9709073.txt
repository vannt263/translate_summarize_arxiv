    "in this letter we consider kaon propagation in isospin symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "there has recently been much effort to evaluate the in medium @xmath3-mass in realistic models .",
    "the chiral lagrangian has been applied perturbatively to the effective kaon mass @xcite .",
    "brown and rho pursue a mean field approach in @xcite .",
    "we endeavor a microscopic description deriving the kaon propagator in dense matter from kaon nucleon scattering in free space @xcite .",
    "consider the change of the @xmath4-mass .",
    "as was emphasized in @xcite it is given by the low density theorem in terms of the empirical @xmath4-nucleon scattering lengths @xmath5 fm and @xmath6 fm @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "model calculations @xcite typically find only small corrections to ( [ lowdensity ] ) .",
    "in fact the next to leading term of order @xmath9 can be evaluated exclusively in terms of the @xmath10-scattering lengths .",
    "we obtain the model independent result @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the correction term is indeed small . at nuclear saturation density with @xmath14",
    "mev it increases the repulsive @xmath4-mass shift from @xmath15 mev to @xmath16 mev by about @xmath17 .",
    "thus the density expansion is useful in the @xmath4-channel .",
    "any microscopic model consistent with low energy @xmath4-nucleon scattering data is bound to give similar results for the @xmath4-propagation in nuclear matter at densities @xmath18 sufficiently small to maintain the density expansion rapidly convergent . consequently the role of chiral symmetry is restricted to the qualitative prediction of the @xmath19-scattering lengths by the weinberg - tomozawa term .",
    "we continue with the @xmath0-mass .",
    "again as a first step one may apply the low density theorem .",
    "the empirical scattering lengths @xmath20 fm and @xmath21 fm @xcite imply according to ( [ lowdensity ] ) a repulsive mass shift of @xmath22 mev with a width of @xmath23 mev at saturation density .",
    "the correction term ( [ correction ] ) results in a total repulsive mass shift of @xmath24 mev and a width of @xmath25 mev . at nuclear saturation",
    "the density expansion for the @xmath26-mode is poorly convergent if at all .",
    "furthermore , the leading terms appear to contradict kaonic atom data @xcite which suggest sizable attraction at small density .",
    "finally the empirical @xmath27 scattering lengths are in striking disagreement with the weinberg - tomozawa term , the leading order chiral prediction .",
    "the solution to this puzzle lies in the presence of the @xmath28 resonance in the @xmath0-proton channel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-resonance can be described together with elastic and inelastic @xmath0-proton scattering data in terms of a coupled channel lippman - schwinger equation with the potential matrix evaluated perturbatively from the chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we also note that a satisfactory description of kaon nucleon scattering data can be achieved by the coupled @xmath3-matrix approach of martin @xcite .",
    "contrary to the @xmath4-propagation in nuclear matter different microscopic models consistent with low energy kaon nucleon scattering data may predict different results for the @xmath0-propagation in nuclear matter simply because an attractive in - medium @xmath0-self energy probes the @xmath0- nucleon scattering amplitude below the kaon nucleon threshold . below the physical threshold",
    "the amplitude is subject to uncertainties due to the necessary subthreshold extrapolation of scattering data . also , as was pointed out first by koch @xcite , the @xmath29 resonance may experience a repulsive mass shift due to pauli blocking which strongly affects the in - medium @xmath0-nucleon scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "this offers a simple mechanism for the transition from repulsion , implied by the scattering lengths , at low densities , @xmath30 , to attraction at somewhat larger densities @xcite as favored by kaonic atom data .",
    "schematically this effect can be reproduced in terms of an elementary @xmath29 field dressed by a kaon nucleon loop . the repulsive @xmath31 mass shift due to the pauli blocking of the nucleon",
    "is given by : @xmath32 with the small scale @xmath33 and the @xmath34 kaon nucleon coupling constant @xmath35 .",
    "in this letter we extend previous work @xcite and treat the @xmath0-state and the @xmath2 states self consistently .",
    "the @xmath36-resonance mass in matter is then the result of two competing effects : the pauli blocking increases the mass whereas the decrease of the @xmath0 mass tends to lower the mass since the @xmath37 can be considered as a @xmath0-proton bound state .",
    "we expect this mechanism to be important for in - medium @xmath27-scattering simply because the characteristic scale @xmath38 in ( [ scale ] ) depends sensitively on small variations of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we describe @xmath0 nucleon scattering by means of an effective lagrangian density .",
    "consider first the isospin zero ( i=0 ) channel : @xmath41 with the isospin doublet fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "here we include the pion and the @xmath44 as relevant degrees of freedom since they couple strongly to the @xmath26 nucleon system .",
    "the nucleon and @xmath45 as well as the kaon and pion fields are constructed with relativistic kinematics but without anti - particle components .",
    "the free nucleon and kaon propagators take the form : @xmath46 respectively , where @xmath47 .",
    "the isospin zero coupled channel scattering amplitude @xmath48 is given by the set of ladder diagrams resumed conveniently in terms of the bethe - salpeter integral equation .",
    "since the interaction terms in ( [ lagrangianzero ] ) are local the bethe - salpeter equation reduces to the simple matrix equation @xmath49 with the loop matrix @xmath50 diag @xmath51 and @xmath52 small range terms are included in our scheme by the replacements @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 induced by appropriate additional terms in ( [ lagrangianzero ] ) .",
    "the loop functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are regularized by the cutoff @xmath58 gev . for small three momenta @xmath59 the loop functions @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "depend to good accuracy exclusively on the combination @xmath62 as expected from covariance .    the lagrangian density ( [ lagrangianzero ] ) follows from a chiral lagrangian with relativistic baryon and meson fields upon integrating out the anti - particle field components .",
    "therefore the coupling matrix @xmath63 is constrained to some extent by chiral symmetry @xcite . to leading order we derive the isospin zero coupling strengths @xmath64 by matching tree level threshold amplitudes .",
    "the chiral matching of correction terms and the range parameters @xmath65 is less obvious and not pursued here .",
    "in fact a consistent chiral matching requires the @xmath0-nucleon potential to be evaluated minimally at chiral order @xmath66 . only at this order",
    "the required counter terms for the loop functions are introduced . in this work the coupling strengths @xmath67 and the range parameters @xmath65 are directly adjusted to reproduce empirical scattering data described in terms of the coupled channel scattering amplitude ( [ ts ] ) .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 results from a least square fit to the amplitudes of @xcite .",
    "we obtain a good description of all coupled channel amplitudes with the isospin zero scattering length @xmath74 fm .",
    "our parameters confirm the result of @xcite that the weinberg - tomozawa term ( [ wttermzero ] ) predicts the interaction strength in the various channels rather accurately .",
    "1 shows that the isospin zero scattering amplitude @xmath75 is clearly dominated by the @xmath36 resonance .",
    "let us now turn to the @xmath76 channel . here",
    "the @xmath0 nucleon system couples strongly also to the @xmath77-channel .",
    "the appropriate effective lagrangian density is : @xmath78 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & { \\textstyle{1\\over \\sqrt{2}}}\\,g_{13}^{(i=1)}\\ , \\big[\\left ( n^\\dagger   \\,\\vec \\tau \\ , k\\right ) \\left ( \\vec \\pi^\\dagger \\ , \\lambda \\right)+h.c .",

    "( [ ts ] ) ) .",
    "the range terms are included by the replacements @xmath80 , @xmath54 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the coupling strengths as obtained by chiral matching of tree level threshold amplitudes are : @xmath84 we point out that the range terms can be expressed in terms of the isospin zero range parameters and one free parameter @xmath85 @xmath86 if constrained by @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "we obtain a good description of the isospin one amplitudes @xmath87 of @xcite with @xmath88 as suggested by the leading order result ( [ wttermone ] ) . the @xmath0-nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath89 as shown in fig .",
    "1 follows with the set of parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the scattering length comes at @xmath95 fm .",
    "we observe that the weinberg - tomozawa term ( [ wttermone ] ) predicts the interaction strengths in the @xmath76 channel less accurately than in the @xmath96 channel .",
    "furthermore , the imposed @xmath1-symmetry for the range parameters ( [ su3ranges ] ) is found to be essential for our subthreshold extrapolation of the @xmath27-scattering amplitude in the @xmath76 channel .",
    "the kaon self energy @xmath97 is evaluated in the nucleon gas approximation .",
    "its imaginary part follows from the imaginary part of the in medium kaon nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath98 : @xmath99 with the fermi momentum @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath101-function emerges from the zero temperature limit of appropriate fermi - dirac distribution functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) and ensures that the kaon spectral density vanishes at zero energy .",
    "the real part of the self energy then is evaluated by means of the dispersion integral : @xmath102 the kaon nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath103 is medium modified exclusively through the kaon nucleon loop since it is given by ( [ ts ] ) with the vacuum kaon nucleon loop @xmath104 replaced by the in matter loop @xmath105 .",
    "selfconsistency is met once @xmath105 is evaluated in terms of the kaon propagator : @xmath106 with the kaon self energy @xmath107 of ( [ kaon ] ) . in the nucleon gas approximation",
    "the loop function reads : @xmath108 with the real part determined by the dispersion integral : @xmath109 it is convenient to formally rewrite the set of coupled equations as follows : @xmath110 with the kaon nucleon loop , @xmath111 , now regularized by our cutoff parameter @xmath112 such as to reproduce the vacuum loop function @xmath113 in the zero density limit .",
    "similarly we write @xmath114 with the nucleon chemical potential @xmath115 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "moreover suppose @xmath120 for @xmath121",
    ". the free space amplitude of our model suggests @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath123 provided that @xmath124 or @xmath125 mev holds .",
    "similar one finds @xmath126 since @xmath127 implies also @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "hence it is justified to solve our coupled set of integral equations with @xmath130 .",
    "we compare various degrees of approximations for the kaon self energy .",
    "the set of equations for the kaon self energy and the scattering amplitude is solved iteratively .",
    "we find that self consistency is reached after few iterations : the kaon nucleon loop function , @xmath131 , is approximated surprisingly well if evaluated with the kaon spectral density as obtained from the free space scattering amplitude .",
    "2 shows contour plots of the kaon spectral density as evaluated with the free space kaon nucleon scattering amplitude , with the pauli blocked amplitude ( the approximation scheme applied in @xcite ) and with the self consistent amplitude .",
    "all three schemes predict a two mode structure of the spectral density , however , with quantitative differences .",
    "both , the pauli blocked and the self consistent amplitude shift strength from the upper branch to the lower branch as compared with the spectral density derived from the free space amplitude .",
    "while the pauli blocked amplitude causes a small repulsive shift of the @xmath132-nucleon hole state the selfconsistent amplitude predicts an attractive shift . at larger densities self consistency affects the @xmath0-rest mass moderately .",
    "for example at @xmath133 mev we find @xmath134 mev and @xmath135 mev as compared with @xmath136 mev and @xmath137 mev from the free space amplitude and @xmath138 mev and @xmath139 mev from the pauli blocked amplitude .",
    "note here that the quasi particle width @xmath140 , given above , differs from the physical @xmath0-width by about a factor of two due to the strong energy dependence of the kaon self energy ( see fig .",
    "we find that self consistency is most important once the @xmath0-mode starts moving relative to the nuclear medium .",
    "here we expect p - wave @xmath27-interactions @xcite , which are not included in this work , to modify our results to some extent .    in fig .",
    "3 we present our final result for the kaon spectral density as a function of the kaon energy @xmath141 for various fermi momenta @xmath142 and kaon momenta @xmath143 . typically the spectral density exhibits a two peak structure representing the @xmath0 and the @xmath37-nucleon hole states . as the fermi momentum @xmath142 increases the energetically lower state experiences a strong attractive shift whereas the more massive state becomes broader . on the other hand",
    "as the kaon momentum increases both states basically gain kinetic energy with the energetically higher peak attaining more strength .",
    "we find that the sum rule for the kaon spectral density @xmath144 holds at the @xmath145 accuracy level .",
    "4 shows the resulting isospin zero @xmath0-nucleon scattering amplitudes with @xmath146 and @xmath147 mev .",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude shows a clear peak around 1.4 gev for all fermi momenta representing the @xmath36 resonance state . as nuclear matter",
    "is compressed the peak gets broader with little effect on the peak position .",
    "the real part of the scattering amplitude changes its sign for @xmath148 from repulsion to attraction as the density gets larger .    as argued in the introduction the @xmath36-mass shift results from the repulsive pauli blocking effect and the attractive feedback effect of a decreased kaon mass . altogether",
    "the @xmath2 resonance mass is left more or less at its free space value , however , with an increased decay width .    9 g.e .",
