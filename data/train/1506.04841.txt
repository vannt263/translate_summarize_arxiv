    "the electric dipole transitions of nuclei at low energies , below the giant dipole resonance , have been under intensifying investigation for more than two decades  @xcite . knowing or predicting correctly the concentration of dipole strength , which can not be attributed to the low - energy tail of the giant dipole resonance , is especially consequential in describing nucleosynthesis processes  @xcite . through its correlations with other observables ,",
    "the amount of strength may be used to constrain the isovector properties of the nuclear equation of state  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the use of hadronic probes and the investigation of unstable nuclei have offered new insights into the nature and isospin structure of low - energy dipole transitions  @xcite .",
    "the extraction of complete spectra on both sides of the particle emission threshold also constitutes important progress  @xcite .",
    "the effort is bound to continue , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "new results on exotic nuclei are under analysis and facilities with improved capabilities are planned .",
    "moreover , the already available dipole spectra are so complex , as functions of the excitation energy , mass , and isospin asymmetry , that a unified theoretical interpretation of them has been elusive .",
    "new data will be needed to resolve the situation , as well as the use of diverse nuclear models .",
    "various factors and mechanisms have been proposed or are recognised as relevant for generating low - energy dipole transitions in medium - mass and heavy nuclei .",
    "a variety of microscopic models have been employed in related studies , mainly the quasi - particle or plain random - phase approximation ( qrpa or rpa ) and models considering phonon coupling .",
    "the presence of strength has been attributed to the concentration of single - particle transitions in the @xmath3 energy region  @xcite , an alpha - cluster mode  @xcite , a surface - dipole vibration , akin to the other known quadrupole and octupole vibrations  @xcite and of toroidal structure  @xcite , or , in the case of neutron(proton)-rich nuclei , an exotic neutron(proton)-skin oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation patterns and precise strength can be explained by the coupling of the dipole transitions to collective phonons  @xcite or collisional damping  @xcite .",
    "is has been demonstrated , in studies along isotopic chains , that also shell structure and deformation influence the low - energy dipole strength  @xcite .",
    "we may add that threshold particle resonances are a general feature of potential barrier scattering and may also contribute to the photoneutron cross section just above the emission threshold .",
    "the question now is , whether certain mechanisms dominate in the different mass and asymmetry domains of the nuclear chart , and at what energy in relation to the emission threshold .",
    "the answer to the first part of the question may well be different in the case of the isoscalar ( is ) or isovector ( iv ) channel .",
    "that is the conclusion we have reached in refs .",
    "@xcite for the dipole strength below particle - emission threshold and in moderately neutron - rich nuclei ( below critical shell closures ) .",
    "the is strength is attributed to a collective mode of vibration , which is excited in @xmath4 nuclei too ; the iv strength , largely to single - particle transitions .",
    "our conclusions were based on qrpa calculations with the gogny d1s interaction and comparisons with experimental data as well as with other calculations , along the ca and sn isotopic chains and in @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "a genuine neutron - skin oscillation may be excited either above threshold or in extremely neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we note that relativistic models favor a neutron - skin oscillation in moderately neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite , while is coherence is generally the outcome of non - relativistic studies  @xcite .",
    "such qualitative disagreements can be attributed to the softness of the symmetry energy , which is typically predicted to be different by the two types of models .    pinpointing the mechanisms which control the dipole strength and establishing correlations with other observables often requires extreme care in interpreting theoretical results , and of course data .",
    "a case in point is the correlation between the dipole polarizability and the neutron - skin thickness , which was found model - dependent  @xcite .",
    "one question which we will address in this work is whether the shell structure affects the polarizability and the skin thickness in different ways .",
    "as regards data , it will be very interesting to confirm experimentally the dramatic role of shell closure revealed in several theoretical studies .",
    "the second part of the question we have posed above is related to scattering in the particle continuum .",
    "in most theoretical studies so far the particle continuum is at best discretized ( for recent exceptions see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "broad resonances in the vicinity of the particle threshold may not be adequately described .",
    "this is another issue we will address here .    in the present work we focus on the ni isotopic chain , which represents an intermediate mass region , between the lighter ca and heavier sn nuclei . known isotopes span the whole @xmath5 neutron shell .",
    "they include the long - lived , symmetric @xmath6ni isotope and several stable ones .",
    "photoresponse data exist for the latter , below particle threshold , and for the neutron - rich @xmath1ni , above particle threshold , while more are expected to be analysed soon .",
    "we are interested in possible collective excitations , the role of shell structure , and in general in the factors determining the amount of strength . as in previous work",
    ", we calculate the properties of dipole excitations using the qrpa and the gogny d1s interaction .",
    "furthermore , we use a continuum - rpa model ( crpa ) and the skyrme functional sly4 , to examine the threshold strength .",
    "we will compare our results with available data and other theoretical results .",
    "our dipole - mode nomenclature should be clarified at this point . in",
    "the following we refer repeatedly to two types of collective dipole excitations .",
    "one is an ordinary _ surface dipole vibration _ , which corresponds to the isoscalar low - energy dipole ( is - led ) mode studied in refs .",
    "we will therefore denote it as _ is - led_. the other is driven by neutron excess and we will refer to it as a _",
    "neutron mode_. the term _ neutron - skin _ mode or oscillation we reserve explicitly for the oscillation of the neutron skin as a spatially defined entity .",
    "some authors call that the pygmy resonance . in this work",
    ", however , we use the term _ pygmy _ to refer to low - energy @xmath0 transitions of any physical origin , as long as they are not considered fragments of the giant dipole resonance .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we introduce briefly the theoretical models we use and define the quantities of interest . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present and analyse our results .",
    "in particular , in sec .  [ sec : resultsmain ] we examine the isovector and isoscalar response of ni isotopes and identify interesting low - energy structures to be studied next . in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : sums ] we calculate the total low - energy strength and the dipole polarizability and compare our results with existing data . a critical discussion of our findings is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we focus on the relevance of shell structure and the phenomenon of isospin splitting and we comment on how our results fit into the ongoing discourse about the relation of dipole states with the softness of the symmetry energy .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this work we employ two models based on the random - phase approximation .",
    "the models have been discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "therefore , we will now present them only briefly and refer the reader to respective publications for more details .",
    "we use mainly the self - consistent quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) with the gogny d1s interaction  @xcite , which has yielded already interesting results in our previous studies of dipole strength  @xcite .",
    "the qrpa is formulated in the canonical basis of the hartree - fock - bogolyubov model ( hfb ) describing the ground state .",
    "the same hamiltonian is used in the description of the ground states and in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels in qrpa , leading to an excellent degree of self - consistency .",
    "the theory and implementation are presented in detail in ref .",
    "the reader may also consult ref .",
    "@xcite for a concise presentation .",
    "a harmonic oscillator basis of 15 shells is used in the present work .",
    "the oscillator length parameter is chosen for each isotope such that the energy of the hfb ground state is minimized .",
    "our qrpa model in the harmonic - oscillator basis lacks a proper treatment of the continuum . for this reason we also explore the continuum random - phase approximation ( ccrpa ) for skyrme interactions .",
    "we employ the sly4 parameterization  @xcite , because it predicts similar nuclear - matter properties of relevance as the d1s model , namely the symmetry energy and the nucleon effective mass .",
    "both models are asy - soft .",
    "they differ mainly in the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) enhancement factor , which influences the energy of the gdr , but not strongly the pygmy - strength properties or the neutron skin  @xcite .",
    "the crpa formalism makes use of green s functions .",
    "the ground state is obtained with the skyrme - hartree - fock model  @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed @xmath7 propagators and the residual interaction are evaluated in coordinate space .",
    "convergence issues with respect to the model space are thus automatically absent .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions account for the possibility of particle emission when the particle energy is positive .",
    "the escape effect can be turned off by imposing box boundary conditions , namely that all wave functions vanish at some distance from the nucleus .",
    "the model is the same as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite and the reader is referred there for further information .",
    "the crpa does not include pairing and we will use it only for a few isotopes which afford a description as closed - shell configurations .",
    "we typically use a radial mesh of 18  fm and a step size of 0.08  fm .",
    "the transition strength distribution corresponding to an external field @xmath9 is given , in qrpa , by @xmath10 where the transition strength of the @xmath11th eigenvalue @xmath12 is given in terms of the 2-quasiparticle @xmath13 amplitudes and the occupation probability factors @xmath14 , @xmath15 the minus sign follows from @xmath16 . in crpa",
    "the strength distribution is determined by the polarization diagram via the green s function @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the spatial and isospin dependence of the external field .",
    "the isoscalar ( is ) and isovector ( iv ) electric dipole response is determined in the two models , in the long - wavelength limit , by the following respective operators , which are corrected for spurious center - of - mass effects : @xmath19 and @xmath20 as far as intrinsic excitations are concerned , the operator @xmath21 is equivalent to the uncorrected @xmath0 operator and to the isovector dipole operator @xmath22 in an obvious notation .",
    "when we speak of _ e1 strength",
    "_ we will refer to the electric - dipole excitation strength @xmath23 corresponding to the operator @xmath21 and we shall use _ is strength _ when we refer to the operator @xmath24 .",
    "the qrpa transition strengths obtained with the corrected operators ( [ eq : e1_is_mod ] ) and ( [ eq : e1_iv_mod ] ) are the same as with the uncorrected forms , except of course for the spurious state .",
    "the spurious state appears always very close to zero energy .",
    "our crpa implementation is not fully self - consistent , in that spin - dependent operators and the coulomb term are omitted from the residual interaction .",
    "therefore , we always scale the residual interaction by a factor such that the spurious state appears close to zero energy .",
    "the scaling factor ranges from 1.06 for @xmath1ni , to 1.11 for @xmath25ni , to the large values of 1.15 for @xmath26ni and 1.22 for @xmath6ni .",
    "the use of corrected operators is imperative .",
    "the discrete energy spectra obtained with qrpa can be smoothed with a lorenzian of a given width , for presentation purposes . in crpa",
    "the spectra are continuous and include the escape width . in order to visualize very narrow or bound structures ,",
    "an artificial width can be introduced by adding an imaginary constant to the particle - hole energy . in our presentation of results ,",
    "when we say that our qrpa or crpa results have been smoothed by means of a given width parameter , we will imply the width at half maximum .",
    "the dipole polarizability @xmath27 which is proportional to the inverse - energy - weighted sum of @xmath0 strength , has been found to correlate with the neutron - skin thickness and the density - dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite .",
    "it has been measured in @xmath28pb  @xcite , @xmath29sn  @xcite , and in @xmath1ni  @xcite .",
    "we will calculate this quantity along the ni chain . in order to eliminate a trivial dependence on the mass number",
    ", we define a reference , collective value @xmath30 , as the polarizability corresponding to the giant dipole resonance if it was a single peak with the empirical energy  @xcite @xmath31 and exhausting @xmath32 of the classical trk sum rule .",
    "this gives us @xmath33 neglecting the trk enhancement factor .",
    "the transition density , between the ground state and an excited state , determines how the system couples to the external field at the given excitation energy and provides insight into the microscopic structure of the excited state . in qrpa ,",
    "solved in a spherical basis , the radial part of the transition density is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the radial wavefunction of the canonical state and @xmath36 refers to its isospin ( proton or neutron ) .    in our crpa model , transition densities are evaluated as follows . in the vicinity of a resonance , at energy @xmath37 ,",
    "the green s function is proportional to a product of transition densities  @xcite . in particular , @xmath38 where we have used spherical symmetry to separate out the angular dependencies , and @xmath39 denotes a proton or a neutron .",
    "folding the above quantity with the external field , we get a function @xmath40 which is proportional to @xmath41 , if eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorize ] ) holds .",
    "we observe that if we fold this with the external field @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath42 times the transition strength ( per energy unit ) .",
    "the above factorization is not always perfect , but in any case the above procedure helps us obtain a quantity , loosely called a transition density , which determines how the nuclear density couples to the external field at a given energy .",
    "it may depend on @xmath43 , therefore , we use the subscript @xmath44 .",
    "different complementary ways can be used to assess the collectivity of a qrpa eigenstate .",
    "one of them is the amount of 2-quasiparticle configurations which contribute considerably to the norm or to the transition strength ( summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bofeqrpa ] ) ) of a given qrpa eigenvalue . in the case of dipole states",
    ", care must be exercised when using the latter criterion , as the results depend on the excitation operator used ( i.e. , whether it is corrected or not )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition , we will employ single - particle units , in order to assess the collectivity of a given state . for @xmath0 transitions the usual single - particle unit",
    "must be corrected for the center - of - mass motion , by multiplying the usual estimate  @xcite by the effective - charge factor squared , namely @xmath45 for proton states and @xmath46 for neutron states  @xcite .",
    "we choose to use the single - neutron unit @xmath47",
    "first we compare the general features of the response , in particular giant resonances , between the two models and with some data .",
    "the only isotopes which can be described using closed subshells and , therefore , lend themselves to calculations with both models are those with @xmath48 , all of which are unstable .",
    "relevant data are available for stable isotopes and for @xmath1ni .",
    "we will , therefore , use @xmath49ni for a first comparison of our results with data .",
    "the nucleon separation energies for the @xmath48 isotopes are calculated within the d1s model to be @xmath50  mev , respectively .",
    "for @xmath51 the values given in the ame2012 evaluation  @xcite are @xmath52  mev , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] we show the calculated photoabsorption cross sections for the above isotopes .",
    "a large smoothing factor has been used .",
    "the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is visible in all cases , with some degree of fragmentation .",
    "the gdr energies predicted by the two models are visibly different , by a few mev .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the different trk enhancement factor ( 0.6 for d1s , 0.25 for sly4 ) .",
    "an inspection of gdr data indicates that the qrpa+d1s model reproduces more correctly the higher - energy part and overall the mean energy of the gdr , while the crpa+sly4 model predicts rather correctly the main first peak of the gdr .",
    "we infer this from fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](d ) and from a juxtaposition of figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma](b , c ) in the expectation that the gdr properties of @xmath6ni and @xmath53ni must be quite similar .",
    "both models can be considered acceptable in this sense . finally , they both appear to underestimate the fragmentation of the resonance . indeed , the fragmentation and spreading of the gdr can be enhanced by effects beyond ( q)rpa , like collisional damping  @xcite , especially in heavy nuclei , and clustering  @xcite , especially in light nuclei . in medium - mass nuclei",

    "we have confirmed that the proton and neutron transition densities show the typical behavior for this mode  @xcite , namely they are in phase and have a node .",
    "the smooth distribution given by the crpa+sly4 model in this energy region is not the result of a large smoothing factor , but of the genuinely large escape width , reproduced through the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the use of box boundary conditions ( not shown ) produces a structured distribution similar to the qrpa+d1s case . in @xmath53ni ,",
    "the high - lying peak was observed at 34  mev , while the calculated response function peaks around 30  mev . in heavier nuclei",
    "theoretical models tend to predict a higher energy for the is gdr than extracted experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is likely a combination of factors , not restricted to the compression modulus , since discrepancies remain when the monopole compression mode is correctly described .    at least two more structures , on which we shall remark next , are visible at lower energies : around 10  mev and around @xmath54  mev , depending on the isotope and the interaction .",

    "we notice that in all isotopes both transition densities are characterized by a node and they are in phase .",
    "the transition densities change very smoothly from @xmath25ni to @xmath6ni and from @xmath65ni to @xmath66ni , and quite smoothly in between the two domains . in the neutron - deficient domain and",
    "including @xmath6ni the similarities between the proton and neutron transition densities and in all isotopes are obvious .",
    "all these states can , therefore , be confirmed as of the usual is - led character .",
    "for @xmath67 the neutron transition densities are stronger than the proton counterparts and somewhat dissimilar to them .",
    "nevertheless , the surface protons contribute even in the very neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "the juxtaposition with the plotted lowest - lying state in @xmath68ni undescores this point .",
    "therefore , to some extent we may also consider them as is - led states .",
    "the observed discontinuities , with respect to the neutron number , especially visible in the neutron transition densities , can be attributed to shell structure , namely the filling of the neutron @xmath69 shell and finally the @xmath70 state . in reality , some of the discontinuities may be smoothened out by correlations beyond hfb and qrpa .",

    "[ fig : pygmy ] we show the transition densities of the neutron - mode candidates in @xmath74ni .    for comparison , the is - led transition densities are also plotted with thinner lines .",
    "there are similarities between the two modes , in particular the presence of nodes and the non - negligible contribution of surface protons in most cases .",
    "we do notice , however , that the proton contribution to the neutron - mode candidate diminishes in the more neutron - rich isotopes ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : pygmy](c),(d ) .",
    "furthermore , this mode is predicted to decouple from the is - led and to develop only in neutron - rich ni isotopes .",
    "for this reason we identify this as a separate mode , driven by neutron excess and assisted by shell effects .",
    "in particular , @xmath58ni is the lightest isotope for which the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states are significantly occupied , activating new @xmath75 configurations .",
    "an analysis of the wavefunctions shows that the @xmath76 and the @xmath77 transitions are coupled into the is - led for the lighter isotopes , while for @xmath58ni and beyond they split from each other and @xmath77 attract and couple to the newly available excitations of @xmath70 neutrons at somewhat higher energies .",
    "the lowest - lying states in @xmath78ni ( below 8  mev in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] ) can be attributed to loosely - bound neutrons in spatially extended orbitals of the @xmath79 shell .",
    "these constitute yet another type of transition , similar to the soft modes of halo nuclei .",
    "the neutron transition densities extend well beyond 8  fm , while the proton transition densities remain localised and peak between 4 and 5  fm ( surface - peaked ) .",
    "this is exemplified by the transition density of the 7.3  mev state of @xmath68ni , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pygmy ] .",
    "the strongly isoscalar and very weakly isovector transitions just above 10  mev resemble the is - led , in that the proton transition densities have a node .",
    "we may therefore distinguish two groups of low - lying strongly isoscalar states beyond @xmath68ni , depending on how strongly isovector they are .",
    "such broad structures might be observable , though not as individual transitions , because they are unbound .",
    "we now examine whether the is - led and the neutron mode in the lighter isotopes ( @xmath80 ) can be considered collective .",
    "the is - led is found strong in the is channel , exhausting a few percentage points of the energy - weighted sum , and it energetically lies below the several @xmath3 configurations contributing to its is strength .",

    "[ fig : xy](b ) .",
    "we stress , therefore , that there is some ambiguity in analyses such as the following .",
    "the prominent proton and neutron contributions to the @xmath0 strength at 12.8 and 12.7  mev , respectively , in both modes come from the @xmath84 configurations , which are not spatially extended .",
    "there are considerable destructive contributions from many other configurations .",
    "the neutron configurations at 12.2 and 13.9 , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86 , are the ones which contribute more strongly to the neutron mode , than the is - led .",
    "they are low@xmath87 configurations and therefore spacially extended . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath88 configuration at 12.66  mev contributes only to the is - led .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xy](b ) we see that the is contributions of the various @xmath3 configurations are mostly coherent in both modes .",
    "we conclude from the above that both can be considered coherent is modes , made up of fragments of many @xmath3 configurations . in this respect",
    "our results are in agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained using skyrme forces , at least as regards the sole mode analyzed there .    based on the above analysis , and on the much higher @xmath0 strength of the second mode at 10.6  mev",
    ", we may consider the latter as of a different kind , namely an excitation of neutrons on the nuclear surface .",
    "the presence of the @xmath89 configuration appears essential in generating coherence for this mode .",
    "therefore the strength diminishes in @xmath26ni , where the neutron @xmath70 state is filled .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : responseni6878 ] we show the is and @xmath0 strength distribution of @xmath1ni and @xmath26ni in this energy region ,    calculated with both models .",
    "we notice that the bimodal structure of the response of @xmath1ni is present also in our results with the crpa+sly4 model .",
    "noteworthy are the significant contributions from the non - resonant continuum in both channels in the region up to around 11  mev .",
    "the effect is predicted to be especially important in @xmath26ni .",
    "such continuum transitions , first studied in the 1990 s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , are likely critical for describing correctly the suprathreshold strength beyond @xmath1ni .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath1ni , if both resonances , namely the is - led and the neutron mode , are bound transitions , the qrpa+d1s can not explain the observed strength .",
    "the same can be said about other configuration - space calculations , employing the sly4 or other skyrme functionals  @xcite . in general , the energies of the unbound single - particle states , and therefore the non - collective single - particle spectrum in the continuum , converge very slowly with the harmonic - oscillator basis size . in actual calculations",
    "they can never be considered converged .",
    "if the particle threshold is much lower than the gdr , this shortcoming becomes relevant for pygmy strength .",
    "it is noteworthy that the crpa+sly4 model predicts increased @xmath0 strength also around @xmath90 mev , compared to the qrpa+d1s model , in the form of additional peaks .",
    "peaks in this energy region are obtained for all four isotopes studied with the crpa - sly4 model , as is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] . as the most possible reason for the additional crpa strength in that energy region we find the overall energetic displacement of one gdr strength distribution with respect to the other .",
    "the proton and neutron transition densities @xmath91 of the crpa peaks in question , for @xmath92 , typically have prominent peaks at a value of @xmath93 somewhat larger than the mean - square radius and they are out of phase at that @xmath94value.ni ( and to a large extent in @xmath26ni ) the surface protons ( neutrons ) play a dominant role . ]",
    "then the peaks could be considered as fragments of the gdr .",
    "they are , however , embedded in a continuum of transitions dominated by surface neutrons .",
    "we note that the existing data for @xmath53ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma](b ) ) and @xmath71ni ( not shown ) do not present a prominent structure on the lower - energy tail of the gdr .",
    "we obtained similar results for the gdr and for these peaks using the skm@xmath95 functional instead of the sly4 .",
    "a similar fragmentation pattern is observed even with the qrpa+d1s model at somewhat higher energies .",
    "the @xmath0 strength of the is - led and the summed @xmath0 strength for different energetic cutoffs as a function of mass number is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sume1exp ] .",
    "+    first we discuss our results with the qrpa+d1s model .",
    "we observe that the @xmath0 strength of the is - led rises up to @xmath96 and then drops again , as a result of the splitting already seen above .",
    "an interesting result is that the summed strength up to 12  mev or similar value does not rise monotonically , but it peaks close to @xmath1ni .",
    "similarly , it has been observed that the low - energy @xmath0 strength does not rise monotonically between @xmath97ca and @xmath25ca  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the neutron excess is not the only mechanism determining the @xmath0 strength . in the context of our calculations , the explanation for the above behavior must lie in the shell structure . as we already mentioned , between @xmath1ni and @xmath26ni the @xmath70 state fills up , blocking transitions from the @xmath98 state .",
    "although transitions from the @xmath70 are available for @xmath99 , we found that they contribute little strength in this region .",
    "the above anticorrelation between the strength and the neutron number in neutron - rich ni isotopes was found also in ref .",
    "@xcite and attributed to the filling of the @xmath70 orbital .",
    "the strength of the neutron mode in @xmath1ni , analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] , exceeds the single - particle estimate .",
    "the summed @xmath0 strength in this region was found large in sn isotopes too  @xcite , but in those cases it is generated by individual weak transitions .",
    "given our past results and how they compare with data  @xcite , we expect the summed strength up to 12  mev to correspond to a summed experimental strength up to , roughly , 9 mev . for the stable isotopes",
    "this would mean an excellent agreement with the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sume1exp ] . in @xmath1ni ,",
    "pygmy strength was found in the continuum up to 12  mev .",
    "notice that , again based on the known trends of the model , we expect the first is peak to be bound , i.e. , below the threshold energy of 7.8  mev .",
    "( for @xmath100ni and heavier isotopes , for which the neutron threshold is below 7  mev , practically all strength is likely in the continuum . )",
    "it follows that our results are marginally compatible with the data in the case of @xmath1ni .",
    "now we turn to the @xmath0 strength obtained with the crpa+sly4 model , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sume1exp ] , for various summation cutoffs .",
    "we notice that the predictions of this model agree with the data for @xmath1ni better than those of the qrpa+d1s model .",
    "a much more dramatic difference between the two models is seen in @xmath26ni ( cf .",
    "[ fig : responseni6878 ] ) . threshold transitions described efficiently by the crpa model likely become increasingly important beyond @xmath1ni .",
    "finally we present results for the dipole polarizability @xmath101 of the ni isotopes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polariz ] we plot @xmath101 relative to the reference value @xmath30 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adcoll ] ) , to eliminate trivial dependencies on the mass number .",
    "+    the polarizability as a function of neutron number varies in a smooth manner between shell closures , at which points , namely @xmath6ni and @xmath26ni , it presents kinks .",
    "obviously this quantity is influenced by shell structure .",
    "beyond @xmath26ni it rises rapidly .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to the strong low - lying transitions observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] . indeed , if we calculate @xmath101 without taking into account the lower - lying states , the function @xmath102 becomes smoother and follows closely the linear trend , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : polariz ] .",
    "we notice that the two models overestimate the polarizability of @xmath1ni , even though the functionals are asy - soft and underestimate the strength of the observed pygmy state .",
    "we elaborate on this contradiction at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : asy ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polariz ] the neutron or proton - skin thickness , defined via the root - mean - square radii @xmath103 is also shown as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , we plot the quantity @xmath105 , which represents a skin thickness relative to the nuclear radius .",
    "it is calculated in the hfb model with the gogny d1s interaction .",
    "the value obtained for the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath1ni is 0.15  fm .",
    "the proton and neutron radii are found almost equal in @xmath53ni , while for @xmath106 , i.e. , @xmath107 , a proton skin develops .",
    "we notice that the ( proton or neutron ) skin thickness increases monotonically with the proton - neutron asymmetry , except around @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of neutron deficiency is stronger when the continuum is propertly treated ( crpa+sly4 ) .",
    "importantly , the fact that the relative polarizability decreases beyond @xmath65ni shows that it does not correlate with the relative neutron - skin thickness , but it is strongly influenced by shell effects .",
    "a possible correlation emerges beyond the @xmath108 shell closure  see also ref .",
    "we conclude from the above that the relation between the proton - neutron asymmetry and the polarizability , along an isotopic chain , is not completely trivial .",
    "we now compare results for the three isotopic chains , ca  @xcite , ni ( this work ) , and sn  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the following general observation , which will help us interpret the isospin structure of pygmy strength and especially the so - called isospin splitting in heavy stable nuclei . by the latter term we mean",
    "the phenomenon whereby @xmath0 transitions are observed over a range of excitation energies below particle threshold , of which only the lowest - lying respond to an is field  @xcite .",
    "first we observe , in the compilation of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the energy of the isoscalar segment , typically @xmath109  mev , varies weakly with mass number in comparison , e.g. , to the shell energy @xmath110mev .",
    "pygmy dipole strength , according to non - relativistic models , is expected at around @xmath3  @xcite and can be attributed to fragments of @xmath3 transitions , rather than a collective mechanism  @xcite . in medium - mass stable nuclei , such as stable ca and ni isotopes ,",
    "the is and pygmy ( @xmath3 ) transitions generally lie far apart , because of the above @xmath104 dependence . in heavier stable nuclei , at least the lower - energy tail of the pygmy strength distribution can approach and overlap with the is state .    indeed , a noteworthy difference observed in the experimental data on stable nuclei is that just a few weak iv transitions are seen on either side of the is - led in @xmath25ca  @xcite , while the is - led candidate lies on the lower end of the , less weak , @xmath0 spectrum in stable sn isotopes  @xcite and other heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation for the so - called isospin splitting of pygmy strength in heavy stable nuclei is then the energetic proximity of two resonance - like structures : the is - led and the tail of the higher - lying pygmy mode ( whether collective or not ) .",
    "we conclude from the above that the isospin character of the dipole strength distribution at low energies depends on the mass region .",
    "regarding the isospin structure of the @xmath0 states in stable ni isotopes , below threshold , we expect that the is and ( weak ) iv strength distributions will mostly coexist without a clear energetic splitting .",
    "our expectation is based on the extended is strength distribution detected in @xmath53ni  @xcite .",
    "the situation would resemble that in @xmath25ca , but with a fragmented is strength distribution .",
    "we can not conclude on the matter based on our calculations , since qrpa predicts the is - led always to be the lowest - lying dipole mode ( see ref .",
    "@xcite regarding @xmath25ca ) and does not include fragmentation mechanisms like phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "next we turn to a different observation . in the ca and sn isotopic chains we found that the @xmath0 strength of the is - led state does not increase monotonically as we add only a few neutrons to the @xmath4 isotope , but it reaches a minimum for @xmath111 slightly larger than @xmath112 . since the @xmath0 strength of this is mode is a result of local dissimilarities between the proton and neutron transition densities  @xcite , reflecting , in turn , dissimilarities in the ground - state densities , it appears easy to explain its behavior as an effect of the coulomb interaction : for @xmath4 the proton density distribution should be slightly more extended than the neutron density distribution , leading to this local dissimilarity .",
    "addition of a few neutrons reverses the situation , resulting in minimal @xmath0 transition strength in between , at some small value of @xmath113 .",
    "this interpretation , which relies on a semi - classical image of density profiles , breaks down in the ni chain , where minimal @xmath0 strength is obtained for @xmath111 slightly _ smaller _ than @xmath112 , signifying a competition between coulomb and asymmetry effects , on the one hand , and shell effects on the other .",
    "indeed , the ni shell structure tends to produce the opposite effect to asymmetry : addition of neutrons to @xmath6ni means filling up lower-@xmath114 states , which are extended to the nuclear surface , immediately initiating what resembles a neutron - skin effect  @xcite .",
    "removal of neutrons from the @xmath98 state , on the other hand , creates some neutron deficiency towards the interior , rather than the exterior , thus delaying the onset of the proton - skin effect in the dipole response .",
    "the above asymmetry between neutron excess and neutron deficiency in the case of the ni isotopic chain is obvious in the transition densities of the is - led , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isled_all ] .",
    "finally , the splitting of the low - energy part of the response , from about @xmath58ni to the shell closure , and the corresponding unsmooth behavior of the is - led properties , constitutes a departure from what we observed , with the same model , in the ca and sn isotopic chains . in ca ,",
    "the filling of the @xmath115 subshell from @xmath97ca to @xmath25ca results in only a moderate and smooth change in the properties of the is - led .",
    "all involved nuclei are stable .",
    "in sn , the filling of the @xmath116 shell gives the same result , even though many of the nuclei are unstable .",
    "all the above observations underscore the relevance of shell structure in determining the @xmath0 strength distribution at low energies .",
    "furthermore , shell effects such as the above have been found to influence the degree of correlation between the neutron - skin thickness and the amount of low - energy @xmath0 strength  @xcite .",
    "next , we comment on the possible role of the symmetry energy and its slope @xmath117 ( asy - stiffness ) in determining the low - energy @xmath0 strength distribution , and in particular how our results fit into the ongoing debate",
    ". a more profound discussion would require further quantitative analyses and , as we argue eventually , more accurate and complete data on @xmath1ni .",
    "our study of the ca isotopic chain  @xcite showed than no skin mode develops in @xmath25ca at low energies ( we can not exclude one above threshold ) .",
    "the gogny interaction , being asy - soft , predicts correctly that the is - led mode survives as such up to @xmath25ca .",
    "now we have found that the qrpa+d1s model underestimates the strength of the pygmy resonance , as measured around 10  mev in @xmath1ni , perhaps by a large amount .",
    "this could suggest that the functional is too soft  hardly a novel conclusion  @xcite .",
    "the same will be true for the sly4 functional ( also asy - soft ) , if the is - led and the neutron mode are bound .    the effect of stiffness on the low - energy strength in @xmath28pb , @xmath118sn , as well as @xmath1ni ,",
    "can be observed in the results of ref .",
    "@xcite : in view of the measured strengths , the ski3 functional ( @xmath119mev ) is too stiff , while the sly4 ( @xmath120mev ) and sgii ( @xmath121mev ) functionals , and even more so the d1s ( @xmath122mev ) , are too soft , in line with the conclusions of ref .",
    "we note also that relativistic functionals , which are typically more asy - stiff  @xcite , predict strong neutron - skin modes , in the form of neutron - skin oscillations , for moderately asymmetric nuclei , thus overestimating their low - lying strength .",
    "we now point out that the softness effect is difficult to disentangle from shell effects . extracting the asy - softness from data on a single nucleus , like @xmath1ni , would be questionable , even though the correlations within a given model are found strong  @xcite .",
    "rather , a different strategy to connect data with the symmetry energy and softness , and subsequent improvement of functionals , suggests itself , akin to the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite : the functional must be soft enough to reproduce the small @xmath0 strength observed in the stable ca and sn isotopes below @xmath123  mev , as well as @xmath28pb . at the same time , it should generate the correct amount of @xmath0 strength in @xmath1ni above threshold .",
    "accurate data on @xmath1ni are highly desirable .",
    "furthermore , data below threshold would clarify the origin of the strength observed above threshold , with the help of our present results .",
    "an important related observation is that , although both models used here are rather soft , they overestimate the polarizability of @xmath1ni .",
    "the same does not hold for other nuclei . in table",

    "both models overestimate the polarizability of @xmath1ni by 10% or more .",
    "if we trust the model systematics , namely that such soft models can not overestimate the dipole polarizability by such a factor , then the discrepancy represents a large amount of @xmath0 strength potentially missing from the data.it is reported  @xcite that a revised measured value of 3.88(31 )  @xmath124 is obtained by extrapolating a lorenzian fit to the data  @xcite beyond the measured energy window . that could lift some of the discrepancy observed here . ]",
    "we iterate that , besides symmetry and isovector properties of the nuclear energy - density functional , additional factors determine the strength distribution , which include shell effects and phonon coupling , as well as the nucleon effective mass in the case of mean - field functionals and the convergence of the calculations just above particle threshold .",
    "we conclude , in any case , that more accurate and complete data are needed for @xmath1ni , than reported in ref .",

    "the qrpa+d1s model underestimates the threshold @xmath0 strength in @xmath1ni .",
    "furthermore , if both modes identified above ( is - led and neutron mode ) are bound , the model fails to explain the peak observed above threshold .",

    "* we conjectured , pending further systematic studies , that accurate and complete data on @xmath1ni not only could clarify the above issues , but provide a complementary constraint to the asymmetry stiffness from below , while data on stable nuclei could constrain it from above .    in the future",

    "<S> the dipole polarizability and the neutron - skin thickness are influenced by shell structure in different ways , so that they can appear anticorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with existing results for lighter ( ca ) and heavier ( sn ) nuclei suggests that the so - called pygmy dipole strength is influenced strongly by shell effects and that , partly for that reason , its isospin structure depends on the mass region . </S>"
