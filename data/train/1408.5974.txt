    "together with the observation that subgroups of gcs on individual streams tend to possess correlated velocities @xcite , this implies that a significant fraction of the remote gc system of m31 has been acquired via the accretion and disruption of dwarf galaxies hosting their own small gc retinues .    although various stellar overdensities within the inner m31 halo have been extensively probed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we assigned a numerical priority to each such star based on ( i ) brightness , and ( ii ) proximity to the rgb sequence , and then optimised the position and orientation of the deimos mask by maximising the sum of the priority values underneath it .",

    "we used a mask with @xmath29 slits , and employed the high - resolution @xmath30 line mm@xmath10 grating and og550 blocking filter , at a central wavelength of @xmath31 .",
    "this provides spectral coverage of @xmath32  with a dispersion of @xmath33  pixel@xmath10 , and a resolution of @xmath34  fwhm near the caii triplet at @xmath35  ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "we bracketed the three individual exposures with arc lamp frames to ensure precise wavelength calibration .",
    "we used the custom data reduction pipeline described in detail by @xcite to process our deimos observations .",
    "basic data processing steps are carried out first ( debiasing , cosmic ray rejection , scattered light correction , flat - fielding , illumination and slit function correction , and fringe correction ) , followed by a wavelength calibration from the arc lamp frames that is finely corrected using the positions of the sky lines and is robust to better than @xmath37kms@xmath10 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a two - dimensional sky subtraction is performed , and the spectra are extracted without being resampled to give a set of observed pixel values , and associated uncertainties , for each target . finally the pipeline measures radial velocities using a bayesian methodology , whereby a simple template for the caii triplet is compared to the observations .",
    "a markov chain monte carlo algorithm is used to find the best - matching doppler shift , and a robust uncertainty , for each target .",

    "figure [ f : cmd+vel ] shows heliocentric radial velocities for our target stars as a function of position on the cmd . there is a clear kinematic signal for stars lying on or near the swc rgb , quite distinct from those objects with positions more consistent with being members of the milky way foreground .",
    "this sub - grouping is also evident in figure [ f : vhist ] , which shows the velocity distribution .",
    "stars for which @xmath44kms@xmath10 ( 15 objects ) belong to the milky way , while those with velocities @xmath45kms@xmath10 ( 21 objects ) are more likely to be part of m31 . looking at the latter group , we see a relatively narrow peak just below @xmath46kms@xmath10 , which is well separated from the canonical m31 systemic motion @xmath47kms@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we interpret this peak as being due to the swc .",
    "as noted previously , m31 halo stars with similar metallicities to typical swc members are not excluded by our photometric target selection . in general the two groups",
    "can not easily be distinguished on the cmd , which means we must statistically separate them in velocity space . because our sample is small , we elect to make some assumptions about the properties of the m31 halo to reduce the dimensionality of the problem . in terms of kinematics , we set the mean halo velocity to sit at the m31 systemic velocity .",
    "we also adopt a halo dispersion @xmath48kms@xmath10 , obtained by extrapolating to @xmath49 kpc the profile measured by @xcite inside @xmath50 kpc ; note that the globular cluster system exhibits a comparable dispersion , @xmath51kms@xmath10 , at this radius @xcite .",
    "most critically , we estimate the degree of halo contamination in our sample as follows .",
    "first we recall that our original set of targets comprised two separate groups : swc candidates selected from the rgb region of the cmd bounded by isochrones corresponding to @xmath5fe@xmath6h@xmath7 \\approx -1.8 $ ] and @xmath23 , and likely milky way foreground objects chosen from outside this region .",
    "eighteen of the @xmath52 stars in the final sample with @xmath53kms@xmath10 come from the `` swc candidate '' ensemble ; the remaining three were obtained by chance in our set of `` foreground '' members . considering the larger group first",
    ", @xcite found that two - thirds of swc stars have @xmath54fe@xmath6h@xmath7 \\la -1.0 $ ] , along with an overall mean @xmath55-band surface brightness for the system of @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite found that at this radius , and in this quadrant , the m31 smooth halo component with @xmath56fe@xmath6h@xmath7 \\le -1.1 $ ] has @xmath57 mag arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "combining these two sets of measurements , and neglecting any second - order relationship between stellar metallicity and luminosity , suggests contamination at a level of roughly one m31 halo star per two swc stars .",
    "that is , we expect @xmath58 of the @xmath59 `` swc candidate '' stars with @xmath53kms@xmath10 to be contaminants . of the three serendipitous `` foreground '' stars with m31-like velocities , two lie well outside the populated range of the @xcite mdf and are almost certainly not swc members , while one is ambiguous .",
    "overall , we therefore expect @xmath60 of the final sample of @xmath52 stars with @xmath53kms@xmath10 to be m31 halo members , with the remainder belonging to the swc .",
    "set to the velocity uncertainty for any given star .",
    "both panels reveal a clear kinematic peak near @xmath61kms@xmath10 that we interpret as the swc .",
    "the magenta dashed line denotes the most - likely model from our first analysis method  the swc profile is centred at @xmath62kms@xmath10 and has a width given by the intrinsic dispersion @xmath63kms@xmath10 added in quadrature to the typical measurement uncertainty per star with @xmath64kms@xmath10 of @xmath65kms@xmath10 .",
    "the grey shaded areas indicate regions we expect to be occupied by the milky way foreground , and the m31 halo ( i.e. , @xmath66 as described in section [ s : analysis]).,width=283 ]    we undertook two independent analyses to determine the kinematic properties of the swc .",
    "for the first , we assume a gaussian velocity profile centred on @xmath67 and with dispersion @xmath68 .",
    "the membership likelihood is given by @xmath69^{f ( ( g - i)_j , i_j ) }   \\label{e : likelihood}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 are the velocities and associated errors of the measured stars , and @xmath71 is a weighting function ' on magnitudes for clarity . ]",
    "based upon the proximity of the stars to the rgb locus @xmath72 the weighting function @xmath71 is also taken to be a gaussian , centred upon the locus and with a width of @xmath73 ; in the final analysis , two values of @xmath74 0.05 and 0.1 mag were considered , with no significant effect on the results .",
    "we separated the swc members from m31 halo contaminants by imposing a prior excluding stars with @xmath75kms@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity distribution to more negative values than the swc peak near @xmath61kms@xmath10 falls off steeply , suggesting that the structure is relatively cold with @xmath76kms@xmath10 .",
    "thus our chosen prior sits @xmath77 from the swc peak and @xmath78 from @xmath79 , and results in 8 stars being assigned to the m31 halo  in line with the expected degree of contamination outlined above .",
    "the search over parameter space yielded marginalised distributions , shown in figure [ f : maxlike ] , with @xmath80kms@xmath10 and @xmath81kms@xmath10 ; these values correspond to the @xmath82 percentiles , and the uncertainties to the 13.6 and 86.4 percentiles , respectively .",
    "note that the distribution in @xmath68 is asymmetric ; for completeness the peak value of the likelihood occurs at @xmath83kms@xmath10 , whereas the peaks of the marginalised likelihoods occur at @xmath84kms@xmath10 and @xmath85kms@xmath10 respectively .",
    "our second analysis method involved a more sophisticated treatment of the potential contaminants .",
    "for this we used a modified version of the algorithm developed by @xcite to quantify the internal kinematics of m31 satellite dwarf galaxies .",
    "we refer the reader to that article for a full description ; here it is sufficient to note that the method works by using a maximum likelihood approach to simultaneously fit the observed velocity distribution with several gaussian profiles  two for the milky way foreground , one for the m31 halo ( with assumed properties negligibly different from those outlined above , @xmath86kms@xmath10 and @xmath87kms@xmath10 ) , and one for a substructure of arbitrary @xmath88 .",
    "the substructure profile matches equation [ e : likelihood ] , but with @xmath71 replaced by @xmath89 , representing the membership probability given a star s position both on the cmd and in velocity space ; however , we ignore this as the deimos field of view is much smaller than the spatial extent of the swc . ] ",
    "i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "the cmd probability is defined by placing a bounding box around the substructure rgb , outside of which @xmath91 is zero , and within which it is determined from the smoothed density map .",
    "the velocity probability is obtained by iteratively considering the proximity of the star in velocity space to the contaminant profiles and the most likely location of the substructure profile , and taking into account the assumed fraction of stars in each population .",
    "( left panel ) , and intrinsic dispersion @xmath68 ( right panel ) .",
    "results from the first analysis method are plotted with a dashed red line , and those from the second method with a solid black line .",
    "the horizontal lines represent canonical 1 , 2 and 3@xmath92 confidence intervals , derived assuming gaussian uncertainties.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]   ( left panel ) , and intrinsic dispersion @xmath68 ( right panel ) .",
    "results from the first analysis method are plotted with a dashed red line , and those from the second method with a solid black line .",
    "the horizontal lines represent canonical 1 , 2 and 3@xmath92 confidence intervals , derived assuming gaussian uncertainties.,title=\"fig:\",width=143 ]    the marginalised probability distribution functions for @xmath67 and @xmath68 from this approach are shown in figure [ f : maxlike ] .",
    "the algorithm clearly identifies the same peak as our first method , finding @xmath93kms@xmath10 and @xmath94kms@xmath10 , where the uncertainties reflect @xmath95 confidence intervals .",
    "note the marginalized distributions are substantially narrower than those from the first method , due to the more careful modelling of the contaminating populations .",
    "the systemic velocity we measure for our swc field is relatively robust to changes in the assumed properties of the m31 halo .",
    "for example , moving the velocity cut - off to @xmath96kms@xmath10 in the first analysis method , or reducing the expected number of m31 halo contaminants to @xmath97 in the second method , leads to @xmath98kms@xmath10 . on the other hand , the inferred dispersion is quite sensitive to the estimated degree of contamination ",
    "if this drops below @xmath99 stars ( or the velocity cut - off is set above @xmath100kms@xmath10 ) then the dispersion blows out to @xmath101kms@xmath10 .",
    "related to this , figure [ f : vhist ] shows that the centre of the velocity distribution for likely m31 halo stars apparently sits closer to @xmath102kms@xmath10 than to the systemic velocity @xmath103kms@xmath10 .",
    "if our contamination assessment is accurate , this observation might hint at rotation in the m31 stellar halo .",
    "this would be in the same sense as that observed for the outer gc system by @xcite .",
    "while @xcite found little evidence for a rotating halo , we will revisit this tantalising possibility in a future contribution .",
    "our keck field is adjacent to the globular cluster pa-8 , which has been shown to be cospatial in three dimensions with the swc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two measurements of the velocity of pa-8 exist : @xmath104kms@xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath105kms@xmath10 @xcite . within the uncertainties these are an excellent match to the systemic velocity of the central part of the swc as derived here .",
    "moreover , as noted previously the velocity of the cluster pa-14 ( @xmath106kms@xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which projects onto the southern outskirts of the swc , is very close to that of the cold kinematic peak at @xmath107kms@xmath10 discovered serendipitously in a nearby field by @xcite .    taken together , this is compelling evidence that the globular clusters pa-8 and pa-14 are coherent in phase space with the stars that constitute the swc , and hence that the gcs and the substructure share a common origin .",
    "although this has previously been argued on a statistical basis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) our present results directly establish a physical link between the two .",
    "we thus confirm that the accretion of satellite dwarf galaxies deposits not only stars but also gcs into the halos of large galaxies , in a manner similar to that originally suggested for the milky way by @xcite and demonstrated spectacularly with the discovery of the disrupting sagittarius dwarf and its small cluster retinue .",
