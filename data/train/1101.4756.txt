    "pattern formation in spatially extended systems has been an object of extensive study in past few decades . the reasons for the interest in pattern formation are not far to seek .",
    "pattern formation happens in several natural systems and scientists are interested in understanding it .",
    "examples could be flame propagation or occurrence of spirals in a chemical reactions or patterns on the skins of animals modeled by reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "several systems like biological patterns @xcite , charge density waves or josephson junction arrays @xcite , lasers @xcite have been studied extensively from the viewpoint of dynamics and pattern formation .",
    "the practical importance of understanding above systems can not be overemphasized .",
    "partial differential equations , coupled ordinary differential equations , coupled oscillator arrays and coupled maps have all been used to model different physical and biological systems and have uncovered interesting modifications of equilibrium , bifurcations and stability properties of collective spatiotemporal states .",
    "these systems have been studied extensively@xcite . however , while we have arrived at a good understanding of low dimensional chaos in past two decades , and understood routes to chaos in several seemingly disparate systems in an unified manner , the same is not true for spatiotemporal systems .",
    "as one would expect , there is practical relevance to these models .",
    "certain simplified models of spatiotemporal dynamics have been studied extensively in recent past .",
    "we would like to make a special mention of coupled map lattices which have been studied extensively in the hope that the understanding we have developed in low - dimensional systems could be useful in understanding spatiotemporal dynamics .",
    "majority of the studies are in coupled one - dimensional maps . at times , they have been successful in modeling certain patterns observed in spatiotemporal systems .",
    "for example , the phenomena of spatiotemporal intermittency in rayleigh - benard convection has been modeled by coupled map lattices @xcite .",
    "they have been used to model spiral waves in b - z reaction @xcite and even in crystal growth @xcite .",
    "we feel that these studies could be helped considerably by _",
    "quantitatively _ identifying different phases in the system and attempting to understand transitions between those .",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to transition to synchronization in these systems which is easy to identify and analyze .",
    "however , other spatiotemporal patterns are far less analyzed and understood .",
    "it is worth noting that in several spatiotemporal systems the field is high dimensional .",
    "for example , for a chemical reaction , we would require information about concentrations of all reactants and products at all points to be able to simulate the system .",
    "there are several phenomena which are possible only when dynamics is higher dimensional .",
    "on the other hand most of the existing studies in coupled map lattices are about coupled one - dimensional maps and very few involving high dimensional maps , for example coupled chialvo s map @xcite , coupled henon map @xcite , arnold s cat map @xcite , modified baker s map for ising model @xcite , etc . here",
    "we try to study coupled higher dimensional maps .",
    "we try to systematically change the dimensionality of the map and study coupled maps with feedback where the feedback time could be varied .",
    "we plot the phase diagram of coupled circle map with delay in two parameter space of coupling strength @xmath1 and delay time @xmath2 .",
    "the abbreviation sfp , frp , fp - p / c and stc denote synchronous fixed point , frozen random pattern , fixed point - periodic / chaotic cycles and spatiotemporal chaos respectively . in the inset , we magnify the phase boundary between fp - p / c regime and stc regime .",
    "we can have only integer values of feedback time and the lines in phase diagram are guide to the eye .",
    "the black solid circles indicate points in phase space where spatiotemporal fixed point phase is seen .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]    in coupled map lattice ( cml ) @xcite time evolution is conflict between competing tendencies : the diffusive coupling between units tends to make the system homogeneous in space , while the chaotic map produces temporal inhomogeneity , due to sensitive dependence on initial condition .",
    "such systems display a rich phase diagram and origin and stability of various phases in these systems are of theoretical and practical interest .",
    "the transitions between various phases in these systems could be viewed as dynamic phase transitions .",
    "though these are clearly non - equilibrium systems , different techniques used in the study of equilibrium phase transitions have been applied to explore the variety of phenomenologically distinct behaviors .",
    "such non - equilibrium systems range from growths of surfaces@xcite to traffic jams in vehicular traffic and granular flows@xcite . for such analysis",
    ", there is a need to define an order parameter that will characterize the transition .",
    "however , not many dynamic phase transitions have been studied from this viewpoint @xcite .",
    "most of the studies are devoted to transition in models with so - called absorbing states . in the context of synchronization",
    ", there have been extensive studies to ascertain whether or not this transition is in the universality class of directed percolation @xcite .",
    "transition to synchronization , locking in of the dynamics of several systems to a collective oscillation , is an important but minuscule part of overall spatially extended systems .",
    "several non - synchronization transitions have been observed such as spiral state to spatiotemporal chaos @xcite , traveling wave to spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics is far richer and other transitions deserve attention .",
    "as suggested by pyragas , feedback in the dynamical systems can play a central role in controlling chaos by stabilizing upo s embedded in chaotic attractor@xcite .",
    "the scheme has been efficiently implemented in wide range of experimental applications .",
    "feedback leading to synchronization is a well established fact supported by several researchers@xcite .",
    "though feedback has been an important aspect of studies in control and synchronization , not much has been said about its effect on different dynamical phases .",
    "it is then important to find the effects of feedback in terms of alterations in system dynamics that may lead to origin of different dynamic phases .    in this work , we investigate coupled maps with feedback . as mentioned before , coupled higher dimensional maps have not been studied adequately . using feedback",
    ", we can systematically vary dimensionality of local map using feedback and study its effect on overall dynamics .",
    "we note that the feedback as defined in our model does not change the location of fixed point of system without feedback .",
    "we have used it extensively as a reference point .",
    "this allows us to study spatially extended higher dimensional systems with known properties .",
    "we investigate a model of coupled circle maps with feedback .",
    "the strength of feedback and the delay time are the parameters in the system",
    ". we will present a general phase diagram of the system .",
    "in particular , we observe a novel transition from _ localized chaos to spatiotemporal chaos_. by localized chaos , we mean that the laminar and turbulent phases coexist in the same space domain for weaker couplings .",
    "the reason to call it localized chaos is that one can see there are well defined boundaries of turbulent sites which do not mix with laminar ones .",
    "a similar pattern has been named spatial intermittency ( si ) in previous studies and some of its properties such as eigenvalue spectrum of jacobian are found to be related to its dynamical properties@xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that persistence acts in effective way to characterize and quantify certain dynamical phases and transition between them in this system .",
    "thus , persistence can be taken as excellent order parameter for certain phase transitions .",
    "the plan of paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in the section ii . in section iii",
    ", we make a detailed analysis of one of the phases , namely localized chaos and calculate quantities such as turbulent length distribution . in section iv , we present our investigations in transition between localized chaos regime and spatiotemporal chaos and we present evidence that persistence acts as an excellent order parameter to characterize the transition . in section",
    "v , we demonstrate that some characteristic features in eigenvalue distributions of jacobian can distinguish between different dynamical phases .",
    "we define model of coupled circle maps with feedback as follows .",
    "we assign a continuous variable @xmath3 at each site @xmath4 at time @xmath0 where @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of lattice points .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 is defined by , @xmath7   + \\delta f(x_i(t-\\tau ) ) \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath1 is the coupling strength and the local dynamical update function @xmath8 is the sine - circle map , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 is the strength of nonlinearity and @xmath11 is the winding number .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is strength of feedback and @xmath2 is delay time .",
    "if we increase @xmath2 , we can increase the dimension of map . in our simulations ,",
    "we confine values of parameters to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling topology considered here is diffusive i.e nearest - neighbor connections . for coupled circle map",
    ", we confine the dynamics in the interval @xmath16 $ ] using the following rule .",
    "if int@xmath17 = m$ ] , @xmath18 if @xmath19 and @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "we study the system with random initial conditions .",
    "the system is updated synchronously with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the feedback does not change the fixed point solution of local map @xmath8 without feedback .",
    "the fixed point solution for the local map @xmath8 is given by , @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter values considered here yield the value of fixed point as @xmath23 .",
    "this point acts as an excellent reference point in visualizing the dynamical behavior of system and also in symbolic dynamics of the system .",
    "we can define the site dynamics to be laminar if @xmath24 for small enough neighborhood @xmath25 and to be turbulent otherwise .",
    "we examine the phenomenology of delay coupled circle map with feedback under variation of coupling strengths and delay time .",
    "various spatiotemporal patterns are clearly evident from phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the bifurcation diagram shown in fig .",
    "note that on y axis of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the time is discrete .",
    "the delay time @xmath2 can only be some integer .",
    "the phase boundary of various regions can be seen .",
    "bifurcation diagram of spatial pattern at an instant of time ( after transience ) , with respect to coupling strength @xmath1 for delay time @xmath26.,width=226,height=226 ]    increasing value of @xmath2 is equivalent to increasing the dimensionality of local dynamics .",
    "there are clearly four distinct behaviors shown by the system as seen from phase diagram fig .",
    "the first region in phase diagram labeled as sfp ( synchronous fixed point ) where , for smaller coupling strengths @xmath27 the entire system goes to local fixed point @xmath28 .",
    "this is an absorbing state and system settles in this state very quickly .",
    "we have checked that this state exists at least for @xmath29 . for higher coupling strengths",
    ", the system goes to spatiotemporal chaos as shown in phase diagram marked as stc .",
    "these different behaviors can also be visualized using the bifurcation diagram fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] obtained for different coupling strengths for @xmath26 .",
    "this bifurcation diagram shows the state of all sites at a given instant of time . for very high coupling strengths",
    ", the system shows some stability islands for some values of @xmath2 though they constitute a small part in phase diagram , we find them worth a mention .    in the intermediate coupling strengths ,",
    "the system shows a rather interesting behavior .",
    "we can see that some of the sites approach local fixed point and some of the sites take on different values which do not change in time .",
    "this behavior is shown in phase diagram marked as frp which stand for frozen random pattern @xcite .",
    "this region is characterized by a spatial sequence of different domains whose size and periodicity may greatly vary . upon further increase of coupling strengths ,",
    "one enters in a region where we can see coexistence of different dynamical regimes .",
    "where some of the sites indeed go to fixed point , some of the sites show periodic / chaotic behavior .",
    "this is an interesting state where one can see that different dynamical phases do not mix with each other .",
    "the regions marked as frp and fp - p / c in the phase diagram collectively represent the dynamics which we refer to as _ localized chaos_. chaos is localized in certain dynamical regimes of turbulence and does not interfere with evolution of laminar states . in localized chaos regime , chaotic domains and periodic domains are fixed in space .",
    "this is evident from spatial distribution pattern .",
    "the perturbations do not propagate in space .",
    "essentially , the dynamics is non - spreading and non - infective in nature , i.e. the spatially intermittent solutions have zero velocity components in spatial direction , and modes traveling along the lattice are absent .",
    "this can also be considered as a case of spatial intermittency @xcite .",
    "the important result is that spatial intermittency is seen over a large parameter regime in presence of feedback . for each feedback time",
    ", we have a well defined region where we get the transition .",
    "these spatiotemporal patterns are clearly evident from space - time density plots below .",

    "histogram of eigenvalues obtained by theory of pertubative analysis . in blue(black ) , histogram of numerically obtained eigenvalues of matrix @xmath30 is given .",
    "the values for turbulent sites given by @xmath31 can also be seen away from the band @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the agreement between theory and numerics can be clearly seen for degenerate as well as non - degenerate eigenvalues.,width=226,height=226 ]     the localized eigenvectors showing peaks at @xmath33 and @xmath34 for lattice size @xmath34 .",
    ", width=226,height=226 ]    .",
    "similar calculations can be carried out for our jacobian @xmath35 .",
    "the localized eigenvectors explain why localized patterns are stable .",
    "the eigenvectors having largest eigenvalue are localized .",
    "thus any perturbation from laminar state is likely to be growing in the direction of localized eigenvectors which does not disturb values at nearby sites .",
    "the above analysis of eigenvalue distribution for localized chaos is restricted to demonstrate the analogy to spatial intermittency .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum clearly differentiates infective to non - infective phase .",
    "the above analysis explains why the eigenvalue spectrum is different for spatiotemporal chaos and spatial intermittency .",
    "in this paper , we have simulated coupled circle maps with feedback .",
    "this allows us to study coupled systems where local dynamics is high dimensional .",
    "we give an overall phase diagram and discuss various dynamical phases .",
    "we also give an all - site bifurcation diagram and remark that there are phases which can not be found from bifurcation diagram and we need to study a detailed simulated space - time plot . in particular , we make a detailed study of a dynamical phase transition between the phase of localized chaos and spatiotemporally chaotic state .",
    "we find various characteristics such as distribution of domains of turbulent sites .",
    "phase transition from different dynamical phases is demonstrated .",
    "we make an attempt to analyze this transition in a manner in which equilibrium transitions are analyzed . in order that we are able to do so ,",
    "it is necessary to define an order parameter .",
    "we find that local persistence acts as an excellent order parameter to characterize the phase transition .",
    "in addition to this , conventional scaling laws pertaining to finite size simulations and offcritical scaling add credibility to use of persistence as quantifier of the transition .",
    "interestingly , same definition of persistence used for without feedback case @xcite works for our case with feedback .",
    "we also calculate one step jacobian of the system and find gaps in eigenvalue distribution of system which is dynamical signature of non - infectious nature of dynamics in ` localized chaos ' regime .",
    "the important effect of feedback is that the parameter window for which spatial intermittency is seen , gets enhanced .",
    "it should be noted that persistence acts as a good order parameter for this transition for all values of @xmath2 including @xmath36 , whereas it is not clear that dynamic characterizer of gaps in eigenvalues spectrum might work for higher value of @xmath2 .",
    "we get this transition for several values of @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that persistence acts as an excellent order parameter for this transition for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "we also try to study gaps in the eigenvalue spectrum which work well for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we go a step ahead in explaining the origin of such gaps in eigenvalues spectra of one step jacobian by perturbation theory analysis .",
    "analytical work also gives an idea of when above analysis may not work .",
    "there is a possibility to experimentally investigate dynamical phases in spatiotemporal systems .",
    "certain electrical oscillators are well simulated with circle maps @xcite and it is relatively easy to implement feedback mechanism in electric devices . if one can define a persistence in an analogous manner in differential equations , it is possible to find persistence in spatiotemporal systems experimentally .    in context of localized chaos , we would also like to point to an interesting work by sethia et .",
    "@xcite where they observe ` chimera ' states , first observed by kuramoto @xcite .",
    "these states have spatially disconnected regions of synchronization separated by regions of decoherence .",
    "thus there is a strong analogy between ` chimera ' states and ` localized chaos ' .",
    "several works study ` chimera ' under various modifications for identical oscillators.@xcite and non - identical oscillators @xcite . coupled evolution of systems with delay induces effectively nonlocal contributions in the evolution of individual system .",
    "feedback propagates in space and time and affects the dynamics at some distant site .",
    "it could be of interest to find some general definition of persistence applicable to these systems and investigate transition to ` chimera ' state as a dynamic phase transition .",
