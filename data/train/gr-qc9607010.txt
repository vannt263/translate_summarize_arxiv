    "gravitational collapse with formation of black holes is one of the main problems of classical general relativity .",
    "a very important question here is how formation of a black hole depends on initial data , for example , which initial data evolve into black holes and which do not .",
    "it is concerned with many important problems such as cosmic censorship @xcite .",
    "christodoulou @xcite rigorously analyzed such a problem in a relatively simple system , namely , spherically symmetric scalar field collapse .",
    "he proved that the field disperses at later times if the initial field is sufficiently weak , and also found a sufficient condition for black hole formation .",
    "however , the behaviour of the field and the space - time for initial data sets around the threshold of the black hole formation remained open , and he posed a question whether the phase transition between space - times with and without black holes is of the first or of the second order , i.e. , whether the mass of the black hole formed is a continuous function at the threshold .",
    "choptuik @xcite numerically analyzed the system and obtained a result which strongly suggests the latter .",
    "furthermore , he discovered a `` critical behaviour '' of the gravitational collapse of the system .",
    "his result can be summarized as follows : let the initial distribution of the scalar field be parametrized smoothly by a parameter @xmath7 , such that the solutions with the initial data @xmath8 contain a black hole while those with @xmath9 do not . for several one - parameter families investigated , near - critical solutions ( @xmath10 ) satisfy the following : ( 1 ) the critical solution ( i.e. @xmath11 ) is _ universal _ in the sense that it approaches the identical space - time for all families , ( 2 ) the critical solution has a discrete self - similarity , and ( 3 ) for supercritical solutions ( @xmath12 ) the black hole mass satisfies @xmath13 and the critical exponent @xmath0 , which is about 0.37 , is universal for all families .",
    "abrahams and evans @xcite found similar phenomena in axisymmetric collapse of gravitational wave and obtained @xmath14 .",
    "evans and coleman @xcite found similar phenomena with @xmath15 in spherically symmetric collapse of radiation fluid , in which case the self - similarity is not discrete but _ continuous_. employing a self - similar ansatz they also found a numerical solution which fits the inner region of the near - critical solutions very well .",
    "since the above values of @xmath0 were close to each other , some people considered that there is a universality over many systems .    for a deeper understanding of these phenomena ,",
    "an important direction is to pursue the analogy not only phenomenologically but also theoretically between the `` critical phenomena '' in gravitational collapse and those in phase transitions in statistical mechanics .",
    "argyres @xcite reviewed the above numerical results in terms of renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "independently , the present authors @xcite showed that both qualitative and quantitative understanding is possible by introducing renormalization group ideas .",
    "they showed that _ uniqueness _ of the relevant ( unstable ) eigenmode of the linear perturbations around the critical self - similar space - time is essential for the universality to be observed and that the critical exponent @xmath0 is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath1 is the only eigenvalue with positive real part .",
    "emphasized there was that the standard renormalization group argument implies that the linear perturbation analysis is sufficient to obtain the _ exact _ value of @xmath0 .",
    "they confirmed that their scenario holds in the case of radiation fluid and obtained a very accurate value of the exponent , @xmath17 .",
    "the difference from those obtained for scalar field collapse ( 0.37 ) and gravitational wave collapse ( 0.38 ) was beyond the possible numerical errors in their simulations .",
    "this showed that there is no universality between radiation fluid collapse and other systems .",
    "maison @xcite applied the method to the systems of perfect fluids with pressure proportional to density and showed how @xmath0 depends on the equation of state , under the assumption that the same phenomena occur and the same scenario holds as the radiation fluid .",
    "gundlach  @xcite confirmed @xmath18 in scalar field collapse .",
    "some new and intriguing phenomena in the critical behaviour have been found such as bifurcation  @xcite and coexistence of first and second order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will pursue a slightly different direction , namely concentrate on providing deeper understanding of basic aspects of the critical behaviour .",
    "this paper is the fully expanded version of ref .",
    "( some of the materials here have already been treated in @xcite . )",
    "the aim of the paper is twofold .",
    "first , we present a general , mathematically rigorous , framework in which critical behaviour observed in various models so far can be analyzed and understood in a unified way , based on a renormalization group picture .",
    "now that there seems to be some consensus on the qualitative picture on the simplest case , we in this paper focus our attention to two problems which remain to be more clarified .",
    "( 1 ) we give a sufficient condition under which the critical exponent is given _ exactly _ by @xmath2 . in the above",
    ", @xmath3 is a scaling exponent which appears in calculating the lyapunov exponent ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] for details ) .",
    "note that in @xcite we only considered the radiation fluid collapse , where one can take @xmath19 .",
    "( 2 ) we also consider the problem of universality , in the wider sense of the word that details of the definition of the model is irrelevant for the critical behaviour , and we present a sufficient condition under which the universality of this kind occurs . both conditions are sufficiently weak that they are expected to be applicable to most systems for which the critical behaviour has been observed .",
    "second , we present a more thorough analysis of the perfect fluid collapse , with various adiabatic index @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to presenting the details of our analysis on the radiation fluid collapse reported in @xcite , we here report a result of a new method of analysis , the so called _ lyapunov analysis _ , which was performed to further confirm the uniqueness of the relevant mode around the critical solution .",
    "a lyapunov analysis and the shooting method for an ordinary differential equation adopted in @xcite are complementary to each other in the following sense : ( 1 ) the former extracts eigenmodes in the descending order of its real part , whereas the latter affords information only of a finite region of complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "( 2 ) the lyapunov analysis is useful even if the eigenmodes do not form a complete set .",
    "( 3 ) it is easier in the latter than in the former to numerically obtain accurate values of the eigenvalues @xmath1 hence the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis in the second part is sufficiently convincing for physicists , we believe .",
    "but mathematically it is unsatisfactory in the sense that it does not provide rigorous theorems .",
    "rigorous full analysis of the system is a subject of future studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present our general scenario in sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] .",
    "we define renormalization group transformations acting on the phase space ( sec .",
    "[ sec - rg ] ) , and see how all the aspects of critical phenomena for radiation fluid collapse , etc . are deduced from the behaviour of the rg flow near a fixed point ( sec .",
    "[ sec - scenario ] ) .",
    "we present a sufficient condition for the exactness of the relation @xmath2 in sec .",
    "[ sub - rgflow ] .",
    "we then consider more general cases , i.e. discrete self - similarity ( sec .",
    "[ sec-discr.ss ] ) and problem of universality for different systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec-univ.class ] ) .",
    "then we turn our attention to detailed study of perfect fluid collapse . after reviewing the equations of motion in sec .",
    "[ sec - eom ] , we first study self - similar solution in sec .",
    "[ sec - ss ] .",
    "then we study perturbations around the self - similar solution and confirm our picture to an extent in sec .",
    "[ sec - pert ] by numerical study . in sec .",
    "[ sec - lyapunov ] we establish uniqueness of the relevant mode by the lyapunov analysis .",
    "the uniqueness of the relevant mode implies that that self - similar solution is responsible for the critical behaviour .",
    "so we list in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] the value of the critical exponent @xmath3 for various @xmath4 .",
    "[ conc ] is for conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section we present a scenario of critical behaviour based on renormalization group ideas , which gives clear understanding of every aspect of the phenomena .",
    "we first introduce renormalization group transformations acting on the phase space of partial differential equations ( pdes ) in sec .",
    "[ sec - rg ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec - scenario ] we give a ( nonrigorous ) scenario for the simplest case where the system has scale invariance and a ( continuously ) self - similar solution plays an important role . even in this simplest case",
    "we can argue most of the essential features of the critical behaviour .",
    "this case covers a perfect fluid collapse treated in detail in the subsequent sections .",
    "we then proceed in sec .",
    "[ sub - rgflow ] to make our scenario into a rigorous mathematical framework which starts from basic assumptions , based on renormalization group ideas .",
    "the case where discrete self - similar solution becomes relevant such as scalar field collapse is understood essentially in the same way , as is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec-discr.ss ] . in general cases where the system is not scale invariant",
    ", the renormalization group transformation drives the equations of motion to a fixed point .",
    "renormalization group method then tells us which systems can exhibit the same critical behaviour , as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ sec-univ.class ] . as examples",
    ", we consider perfect fluid with a modified equation of state , and also show that scalar fields with any potential term ( which depends on the scalar field only ) should show the same critical behaviour",
    ".    currently , there seem to be two kinds of renormalization group type analysis of pdes , @xcite and @xcite . although these two are certainly philosophically related , they differ in details .",
    "we here adapt the approach of @xcite , and extend their work to cases where the critical behaviour is observed .",
    "it would also be very interesting to consider applications of the method of @xcite .",
    "we give a general formalism which deals with time evolution of initial data considered as a flow of a renormalization group transformation .",
    "the argument is general but the notations are so chosen in order to suit the case considered in the subsequent sections .",
    "in particular , we explicitly consider only the case of spherical symmetry , although our framework can in principle be applied to more general cases in @xmath20-space dimensions with suitable changes : the independent space variable @xmath21 is increased to @xmath22 , and the differential operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 become partial differential operators on a space of functions of @xmath20 variables .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of @xmath20 unknown functions @xmath25 , which are _ real - valued _ functions of time @xmath26 and spatial coordinate @xmath21 , and which satisfy a system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) : @xmath27 this real formulation does not restrict applicable systems in any way , because any pdes for complex unknown functions can be rewritten in the real form by doubling the number of components .",
    "we employ this real form , because this makes the dimensional counting ( e.g. number of relevant modes ) simpler and clearer .",
    "see a remark after claim  1 of sec .",
    "[ sec-sen.critical ] .",
    "( however , in practical problems , e.g. complex scalar fields , one could proceed without employing the real formulation , as long as some caution is taken in counting dimensions . )",
    "the time evolution of this system is determined once one specifies the values of @xmath28 at the initial time @xmath29 .",
    "we call the space of functions @xmath28 ( at fixed time @xmath26 ) the _ phase space _ @xmath30 , which is considered as a real vector space .",
    "we leave the definition of @xmath30 ( e.g. how smooth functions in @xmath30 should be ) rather vague , until we develop more detailed theory of time evolution in sec .",
    "[ sec - scenario ] .    to introduce a renormalization group transformation ,",
    "we first define a _ scaling transformation _ @xmath31 which depends on real parameters @xmath32 , and @xmath3 : @xmath33 ( as will be clear @xmath3 here is related with , but not equal to , @xmath0 . )    now we make the fundamental    * assumption  s ( invariance under scaling ) * the system of pdes ( [ eq : evolution ] ) are invariant under the scaling transformation ( [ eq : sctrdef ] ) in the following sense : if @xmath34 is a solution of ( [ eq : evolution ] ) , then for suitably chosen constants @xmath35 , and for an arbitrary scale parameter @xmath36 ( close to @xmath37 ) , the new function @xmath38 is also a solution of the system ( [ eq : evolution ] ) .    in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath35 the constants which make the above assumption hold for the system of pdes ( [ eq : evolution ] ) , and denote @xmath38 simply by @xmath39 unless otherwise stated .",

    "[ sec-univ.class ] , we consider systems for which assumption  s does not hold , and address the problem of universality in its wider sense .",
    "we now define a _ renormalization group transformation ( rgt ) _ acting on the phase space @xmath30 as @xmath40 where @xmath35 are constants of assumption  s , @xmath41 , and @xmath34 is a solution of the pde system .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is given by developing the initial data @xmath43 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 by the pde , and rescaling the spatial coordinate @xmath21 and the unknown functions @xmath46 .",
    "we have written the argument of @xmath47 as @xmath48 rather than @xmath21 , in order to draw attention to the fact that the physical ( or geometrical ) length is given by @xmath49 rather than by @xmath48 itself .",
    "because of our assumption of the invariance of the pdes under scaling , @xmath50 forms a ( semi ) group : @xmath51 from this it follows immediately that the @xmath36-derivative of @xmath50 at @xmath52 is in fact an infinitesimal generator of @xmath50 : @xmath53    a _ fixed point _ of the renormalization group @xmath54 is a point @xmath55 in @xmath30 satisfying @xmath56 for all @xmath41 , and can also be characterized by @xmath57 .",

    "we present our scenario of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse based on the renormalization group ideas .",
    "to describe our claims clearly , we first classify numerically observed ( u ) _ universality _ and ( s ) _ scaling _ into two : ( 1 ) those of the critical space - time and ( 2 ) those of the critical exponent .",
    "concerning the critical space - time , it has been observed that    ( s1 ) : :    near - critical ( but not exactly critical ) solutions always once    approach , but eventually deviate from , a self - similar space - time , ( u1 ) : :    which is unique .    and concerning the critical exponent ,",
    "it has been observed that    ( s2 ) : :    for slightly supercritical solutions , the mass of the black hole    formed is expressed by a scaling law    @xmath99 , and ( u2 ) : :    the value of the critical exponent @xmath0 is the    same for all generic one - parameter families in @xmath30 .",
    "we could add another kind of universality , universality over different systems .",
    "it has been found @xcite that the system for some potentials such as @xmath100 , etc .",
    ", also have the above properties with the same @xmath3 as the minimally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "this suggests that the following universality holds :    ( u3a ) : :    there are some models which show the same critical behaviour ( same    self - similar solution , same critical exponent ) . in particular , in    scalar field collapse ,",
    "the critical phenomena is the same for any    potential @xmath101 , or at least , for some potentials    @xmath101 .",
    "note that the term `` universality '' is used in two ways . in ( u1 ) and ( u2 ) , it refers to the independence on the initial data ( or a family of initial data ) , while in ( u3a ) , it refers to the independence on the system s eom ( i.e. details in the definition of the model considered ) . in statistical mechanics , where the term was used for the first time in a similar context ,",
    "`` universality '' refers to the latter ( although there is no `` initial data '' in equilibrium statistical mechanics and thus it is impossible to have a counterpart for the former ) .",
    "it is one of our main purpose in this paper to give sufficient conditions under which the two kinds of universality hold .",
    "historically , because of closeness of numerical values of the critical exponents of a scalar field  @xcite , a radiation fluid  @xcite , and gravitational waves  @xcite , the following universality in still wider sense , though stated less precisely , was speculated .",
    "( u3b ) : :    the value of @xmath0 is the same over many    systems , including a scalar field , a radiation fluid , and    gravitational waves .    the precise value 0.35580192 ... in ref .",
    "@xcite and the values for scalar field collapse ( 0.37 ) and gravitational wave collapse ( 0.38 ) shows that this is not true .",
    "we now present our scenario through two claims , and their derivations .",
    "we do this on two different levels .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec-sen.critical ] ( resp .",
    "[ sec-sen.exponent ] ) we present claims concerning qualitative ( resp .",
    "quantitative ) pictures on the critical behaviour , and present their ( nonrigorous ) ` derivation ' based on naive linear perturbation ideas .",
    "presentation in this sec .",
    "[ sec - scenario ] is intended to provide basic ideas , so the following claims and their ` proofs ' are _ not _ intended to be precise mathematical statements . in particular , naive perturbation is not sufficient to deal with long time asymptotics rigorously , and this is where the `` renormalization group '' idea comes in .",
    "we thus present in sec .",
    "[ sub - rgflow ] more detailed , rigorous derivation of theorem  [ prop - final ] , a rigorous version of claims  1 and 2 , based on renormalization group philosophy .    a mathematical remark about the phase space is in order .",
    "in order to formulate the time evolution , we consider our phase space @xmath30 to be a _ real _ banach space of functions as a space of gauge equivalence classes of functions . or we could fix the gauge and consider @xmath30 to be a usual function space . in the latter case",
    ", we should be careful in gauge - fixing so as not to count `` gauge modes '' as physically meaningful eigenmodes in linear perturbation analysis . ]",
    "@xmath102 s which satisfy certain decay and smoothness properties , with a norm @xmath103 under which the phase space is complete",
    ". concrete choice of the decay and smoothness properties should be determined on physical grounds for each models , together with the requirement that @xmath30 is invariant under the time evolution .",
    "the term `` approach '' and `` deviate '' in the statement ( s1 ) should be interpreted in terms of the norm of the phase space , although other notion of convergence , e.g. pointwise convergence , could equally work .",
    "precise final definition should be given based on rigorous mathematical analysis , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in the concrete cases discussed later , the fixed point @xmath73 does not represent an asymptotically flat space - time .",
    "though one is usually interested in asymptotically flat space - time in gravitational collapse , we define our phase space @xmath30 to be sufficiently large to include @xmath73 .",
    "asymptotically flat data are included in the phase space ( if one chooses the functions @xmath104 appropriately ) and form a subspace of @xmath30 .",
    "we first consider the qualitative behaviour of critical solutions .",
    "[ claim-1 ] suppose there is a fixed point @xmath73 , with no marginal modes .",
    "if ( s1 ) and ( u1 ) hold with this @xmath73 , then there should be a _",

    "eigenvalue for this @xmath73 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath73 has a unique relevant mode , then ( s1 ) and ( u1 ) hold with this @xmath73 , at least for all the initial data close to @xmath73 .",
    "( except , of course , for the exactly critical initial data . )",
    "* remark . *",
    "because we are considering real pdes , the odes ] for eigenmodes are also real , and thus all eigenmodes with complex eigenvalues ( if any ) appear in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "this means that if such a system has a unique relevant mode , the eigenvalue must be real",
    ".    * remark . *",
    "( reason for employing the real formulation . ) one could proceed without employing the real formulation .",
    "however , in this case , dimension counting becomes more complicated ; because the desired critical behaviour is observed only when the relevant subspace is ( real ) one - dimensional , one has to see whether a given eigenvector spans a subspace of ( real ) dimension 1 or ( real ) dimension 2 . by reducing the system of pdes in its real form",
    ", we can avoid such subtleties .",
    "we emphasize again that this does not restrict the applicability of our claims in any way .",
    "for example , a system of pdes ( for complex unknowns ) which has exactly one relevant mode with a complex eigenvalue is easily seen to have a relevant invariant subspace which is ( real ) two - dimensional , thus leading to the same conclusion ( i.e. this does not show usual critical behaviour ) as is obtained from the real formulation .",

    "an initial data @xmath113 in the one - parameter family @xmath114 , which is close to @xmath110 will first be driven towards @xmath73 along the stable manifold , but eventually be driven away along the unstable manifold .",

    "then the stable manifold of @xmath73 would have codimension more than one , and thus a generic one - parameter family of initial data would not intersect with the stable manifold of @xmath73 .",
    "this means that a generic critical or near - critical solution would not approach the self - similar solution @xmath73 ; instead , they would be driven towards a different self - similar solution with a unique relevant mode .",

    ". @xmath115",
    "( [ eq : crit ] ) states that the fixed point @xmath73 is on the closure of the subspace of @xmath30 which consists of asymptotically flat data .",
    "this explains , in rather precise terms , that the self - similar solution plays such an important role that its perturbation gives an exact critical exponent even when one is interested only in asymptotically flat collapses .",
    "asymptotically flat data can converge to the self - similar fixed point with infinite mass in the above sense , even though the adm mass conserves .",
    "it should be emphasized that there is no contradiction involved here .",
    "that is , the mass measured in the unit of the _ scaled _ coordinate becomes infinite as the space - time approaches the self - similar solution , while the physical mass measured in the unit of the _ original _ coordinate remains finite .",

    "[ sec-discr.ss ] ) , and ( 3 ) different models exhibit the same critical behaviour , i.e. _ universality _ in the sense of statistical mechanics ( sec .",
    "[ sec-univ.class ] ) .",
    "the sufficient conditions for ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are essentially the _ uniqueness _ of the relevant mode , together with some regularity on the dynamics .",
    "the condition for ( 3 ) is essentially that the difference of eom is relatively small in the critical region .",
    "the key idea behind the analysis is the renormalization group .",
    "it naturally casts a system described by partial differential equations into a dynamical system on an infinite- dimensional phase space , where continuously and discretely self - similar solutions of the original equations are described by fixed points and limit cycles .",
    "this opened the way to the abstract analysis on dynamical systems described in sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] . with the help of techniques developed in statistical mechanics to study critical behaviour ,",
    "we have been able to obtain detailed estimates on the time evolution of the deviation from the critical solutions ( or the stable manifold ) .",

    "[ sec - eom][sec - results ] confirms only the _ local _ behaviour of the flow , around the specific self - similar solutions .",
    "although self - similar solutions with more than one zeros of @xmath101 seem to be irrelevant for generic critical behaviour ( because they seem to have more than one relevant modes ) , it would be interesting to know the _ global _ behaviour of the flow , in particular , how these self - similar solutions are related .",
    "second , now that various kinds of critical behaviour for different models have been observed , it would be interesting to ask what happens in a mixed system ( e.g. perfect fluid @xmath990 scalar fields ) .",
    "we performed a preliminary analysis in this direction .",

    "coleman self - similar solution is stable under the scalar perturbation , and we will observe the same radiation fluid critical behaviour for the mixed system ( at least when the scalar field is sufficiently weak )",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the behaviour of the system without the restriction that the scalar field is weak ; in particular , where does the cross - over between two types ( fluid , scalar ) of critical behaviour occur ?    as is suggested from our general framework in sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] , a `` critical behaviour '' such as observed in gravitational collapse is not in fact limited to self - gravitating systems .",
    "similar , but slightly simpler , phenomena can be observed in much simpler systems , such as nonlinear heat equation , where we can rigorously carry out the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] .",
    "however if a solution of eom blows up in such simple systems , it usually means that the equation is not physically applicable in the blow - up region , and the blow - up is an artifact of bad approximation .",
    "general relativity provides rare examples where the blow - up of solutions does have a physical meaning  formation of a black hole .    our analysis in secs .",
    "[ sec - eom][sec - results ] is not mathematically rigorous . in view of the general framework given in sec .",
    "[ sec - rgscenario ] , and in view of the above remark that the critical behaviour and blow - up of solutions are in fact physically meaningful , it is extremely desirable to develop a mathematically rigorous analysis of critical behaviour for a physically interesting model such as radiation fluid or scalar fields .",

    "our intuition on gravitational collapse still seems to be heavily based on few exact solutions , especially the limiting case of pressureless matter .",
