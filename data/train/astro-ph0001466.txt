    "cosmic - ray driven nucleosynthesis has been known to be important for the origin of the light elements li , be and b ( libeb ) for three decades ( reeves , fowler , & hoyle 1970 ) . but",
    "constraints on the relevant evolutionary models could only be obtained after libeb abundances of low metallicity stars started to become available ( e.g. ryan et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the principal three models currently considered are : ( i ) the cosmic - ray interstellar model ( hereafter cri ) , in which the cosmic - ray source composition at all epochs of galactic evolution is assumed to be similar to that of the average ism at that epoch ( vangioni - flam et al . 1990 ; fields & olive 1999 ) ; ( ii ) the cri+lecr model , in which metal enriched low energy cosmic rays ( lecrs ) are superimposed onto the cri cosmic rays ( cass , lehoucq , & vangioni - flam 1995 ; vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1996 ; ramaty , kozlovsky , & lingenfelter 1996 ) ; and ( iii ) the cosmic - ray superbubble model ( hereafter crs ) , in which the cosmic - ray source composition is taken to be constant , independent of the ism metallicity ( ramaty et al . 1997;2000 ; higdon , lingenfelter , ramaty 1998 ) .",
    "both the crs cosmic rays and the lecrs are thought to be accelerated out of supernova enriched matter in superbubbles .    because of the excess of the observed be abundances in low metallicity stars over the predictions of the cri model , and motivated by reports of the detection of c and o nuclear gamma - ray lines from the orion star formation region ( bloemen et al .",
    "1994 ) , lecrs , enriched in c and o relative to protons and @xmath2 particles , were superimposed on the cri cosmic rays , hence the cri+lecr model .",
    "these lecrs , with maximum energies not exceeding about 100 mev / nucleon , were thought ( e.g. ramaty 1996 ) to be responsible for the gamma rays reported from orion .",
    "it was suggested that such enriched lecrs might be accelerated out of metal - rich winds of massive stars and supernova ejecta ( bykov & bloemen 1994 ; ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ; parizot , cass , & vangioni - flam 1997 ) by an ensemble of shocks in superbubbles ( bykov & fleishman 1992 ; parizot cass , & vangioni - flam 1997 ) .",
    "the orion gamma - ray data , however , have been retracted ( bloemen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "nonetheless , as the possible existence of the postulated lecrs remains , new gamma - ray line data are needed to determine the role of lecrs in libeb production .",
    "recent o abundance data , which suggest that [ o / fe ] increases with decreasing [ fe / h ] at low metallicities ( israelian et al .",
    "1998 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "1999 ) , led fields and olive ( 1999 ) to reexamine the viability of the cri model .",
    "more recent measurements ( fulbright & kraft 1999 ; westin et al . 1999 ) argue against such an [ o / fe ] increase . but as demonstrated in ( ramaty et al .",
    "2000 ) , and also shown below , this model is inconsistent with cosmic - ray energetics , an [ o / fe ] increase notwithstanding .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested ( lingenfelter , ramaty , & kozlovsky 1998 ; higdon et al .",
    "1998 ) , that the be evolution can be best understood in the crs model , in which the cosmic - ray metals at all epochs of galactic evolution are accelerated predominantly out of supernova ejecta .",
    "lingenfelter et al . ( 1998 ) and lingenfelter & ramaty ( 1999 ) showed that the arguments ( e.g. meyer , drury , & ellison 1997 ) against the supernova ejecta origin of the current epoch cosmic rays can be answered , and higdon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and higdon , lingenfelter , & ramaty ( 1999 ) showed that the most likely scenario is collective acceleration by successive supernova shocks of ejecta - enriched matter in the interiors of superbubbles .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the delay between nucleosynthesis and acceleration ( time scales @xmath410@xmath5 yr ) , suggested by the @xmath6co and @xmath6ni observations ( wiedenbeck et al . 1999 ) . in both the crs and cri+lecr models ,",
    "the bulk of the be in the early galaxy is produced by accelerated c and o interacting with ambient h and he . that these  inverse reactions \" are dominant in the early galaxy was first suggested by duncan , lambert , & lemke ( 1992 ) .    in the present paper we present results from a complete set of libeb evolutionary calculations for all three models using our production code described in ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and evolutionary code detailed in ramaty et al .",
    "figure  1 shows the evolution of [ o / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] . in order to account for the possible rise of [ o / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ]",
    ", we introduced mixing delays , i. e. the delayed deposition of the synthesized products into the star forming regions due to differences in transport and mixing .",
    "we choose a short mixing time for oxygen because we expect the bulk of the o and other volatiles in the ejecta to mix with the ism after the remnant slows down to local sound speeds .",
    "but we consider longer mixing times for fe , assuming that the bulk of the ejected fe is incorporated into high velocity refractory dust grains which continue moving for longer periods of time before they stop and can be incorporated into newly forming stars .",
    "the incorporation of a large fraction of the synthesized fe into dust grains is supported by observations of both supernova 1987a and the galactic 1.809 mev gamma - ray line resulting from the decay of @xmath7al ( for more details and references see ramaty et al .",
    "we see that with the mixing delays ( solid curves in figure  1 ) both the ww95 and ts cases ( see figure caption ) become consistent with the israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999a ) data , showing that delayed fe deposition could indeed be the cause for the rise of [ o / fe ] . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting to note that , unlike [ o / fe ] , the abundance ratios of the @xmath2-nuclei mg , si , ca and ti relative to fe do not increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] below [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ( ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ) .",
    "this may be consistent with the fact that these elements are also refractory , and thus are affected by mixing in the same way as is fe .",
    "a test may be provided by sulfur , which is volatile , and thus should show a rise similar to the rise of [ o / fe ] vs. decreasing [ fe / h ] ( g. israelian , private communication , 1999 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the employed c and o abundances of the ism and the cosmic ray source . for the ism ( left panel )",
    "we take [ c / h]@xmath9[fe / h ] , because at early times both the c and fe come primarily from core collapse supernovae of massive stars , while at later times the increased c contribution from the winds of intermediate mass stars is compensated by the fe contribution from the thermonuclear supernovae of the white dwarf remnants of such stars ( see timmes , woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "the o abundances follows from the results of evolutionary calculations shown in figure  1 . unlike in ramaty",
    "( 2000 ) , where we used a constant he abundances , here we allow he / h ( by number ) to vary slowly from 0.08 at very low metallicities to 0.1 at [ fe / h]=0 . for the cosmic - ray source ( right panel ) , we define the logarithmic ratios [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] in the same way as is done for the corresponding ism values , including normalization to solar ( not current epoch cosmic ray source ) abundances . as the crs cosmic rays are accelerated primarily out of supernova ejecta enriched superbubbles , [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] are constant , set equal to current epoch cosmic - ray values . for the cri model we scale [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] to the ism values with enhancement factors of 1.5 and 2 , consistent with the mass - to - charge dependent acceleration of volatiles ( ellison , drury & meyer 1997 ) , except at [ fe / h]=0 where the cosmic ray crs and cri values are equal . for details on the rest of the employed cosmic - ray sources abundances see ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for the lecrs",
    "we adopt the crs abundances .",
    "the crs , cri and lecr source energy spectra are power laws in momentum with high energy exponential cutoffs ( characteristic energy @xmath10 ) , which we set to an ultrarelativistic value for the crs and cri cosmic rays and to 30 mev / nucleon for the lecrs .",
    "figure  3 shows the resultant @xmath11 s , the total number of nuclei @xmath12 produced by an accelerated particle distribution normalized to the integral cosmic - ray energy @xmath13 , for a given source energy spectrum , and cosmic ray and ambient medium compositions as described above .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that the accelerated particle source energy spectrum is independent of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the resultant crs and cri @xmath11 s for be and @xmath3li ( left panel ) are for @xmath14 , typical of currently inferred values for  leaky box \" cosmic - ray propagation models .",
    "while @xmath2@xmath2 dominated @xmath15 is not very different for the crs and cri models , @xmath16 is drastically different for the two models , reflecting the fact that efficient be production in the early galaxy can only result from c and o enriched accelerated particles .",
    "the different o abundances employed in the calculation of @xmath11 for the two mixing delays cases ( see figure  2 ) lead to significantly different @xmath17 s for cri model .",
    "the lecr @xmath11 s ( right panel ) show that , while removal of the protons and @xmath2 particles ( the crs(metal ) composition ) significantly increases @xmath11 for be , it essentially leaves @xmath18 unchanged , because the lack of @xmath3li production by @xmath2 particles is compensated by a smaller w due to the absence of the protons and alphas .",
    "figure  4 shows the be evolution for the crs and cri models . in the calculations ,",
    "10@xmath19 erg per supernova are imparted to the cosmic rays , a value in very good agreement with current epoch cosmic - ray energetics .",
    "we note that even though the overall slope of log(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] is practically unity , while that of log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] is significantly steeper ( 0.96@xmath200.04 and 1.45@xmath200.04 , respectively , boesgaard et al .",
    "1999b ) , the crs model provides a good fit to these evolutionary trends , particularly if n@xmath21 is near 0.1 .",
    "such a low value might not be unreasonable for an average halo hydrogen density if 10@xmath1m@xmath22 are spread over a few kpc@xmath23 .",
    "the calculated log(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] is flatter than log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] because the delayed deposition of the synthesized be , caused by the low n@xmath21 , is compensated by the delayed fe deposition , due to the incorporation of fe in high velocity dust , but not compensated by the very short delay of the deposition of o , which is mostly volatile . as in ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we see that the cri model , normalized to a reasonable energy in cosmic rays per supernova , severely underproduces the measured be abundances .",
    "however , unlike in that paper where we showed the result only for log(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] , here we show that the same result also holds for log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] .",
    "this removes the remaining ambiguity concerning our argument against the result of fields & olive ( 1999 ) , who claimed that the cri model would be viable if instead of fe ejecta per supernova based on calculations , which are somewhat uncertain , they used values based on their fit to the increasing [ o / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "as there is no such uncertainty concerning the o ejected masses , our present result unequivocally demonstrates that the cri model is untenable .",
    "figure  5 shows the be evolution for the cri+lecr model . here , as before , 10@xmath19 erg per supernova",
    "are imparted to the cri cosmic rays , but in order to achieve a fit to the log(be / h ) vs. [ fe / h ] data , we had to add more energy ( 1.5@xmath2410@xmath19 erg per supernova ) in lecrs .",
    "the need for this increased energy can be seen in figure  3 , where the @xmath17 for the lecr model with the crs composition ( right panel ) is lower by about a factor of 2 than the corresponding value for the crs model ( left panel ) .",
    "returning to figure  5 , we see that the cri+lecr model leads to a log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] evolutionary curve with a slope which is only slightly steeper than 1 , while , as mentioned above , the data indicate a slope of 1.45@xmath200.04 ( boesgaard et al .",
    "indeed , the simplest evolutionary considerations for both the crs and lecr models would predict that log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] should have a slope of 1 .",
    "but , as shown above , the delay introduced by cosmic - ray transport with n@xmath21=0.1 will steepen the slope .",
    "however , the lecrs slow down much faster than the higher energy crs cosmic rays .",
    "thus , the calculation of figure  5 assigns no delay to the be deposition , leading to a possible inconsistency between the predictions of the cri+lecr model and the log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] data .",
    "figure  6 shows the boron isotopic ratio ( left panel ) and log(b / be ) ( right panel ) vs. fe / h for the crs and cri+lecr models . in the evolutionary calculations , the production ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the crs and cri cosmic rays , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the lecrs ,",
    "were taken as independent of [ fe / h ] .",
    "these numerical values are from ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and are valid for high energy crs and cri cosmic rays and lecrs with @xmath29 mev / nucleon . in order to reproduce the meteoritic @xmath0b/@xmath1b both",
    "the crs and cri+lecr models require the addition of @xmath30-produced @xmath0b ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "we take into account the metallicity dependence of this @xmath0b production , and the fact that only the core collapse supernovae produce @xmath0b by neutrinos .",
    "we find that for the crs model the meteoritic data can be fit with @xmath31=0.18 , a lower value than we found in ramaty et al .",
    "( 2000 ) because of the lower cosmic - ray energy per supernova that we use here ( 10@xmath19 vs. 1.5@xmath2410@xmath19 erg that we used in that paper ) .",
    "the rise in @xmath0b/@xmath1b and b / be for n@xmath21 = 0.1 below [ fe / h ] of about @xmath32 in the crs model is due to the delayed deposition of the cosmic - ray produced be and b relative to the @xmath30-produced @xmath0b for which we took a short delay time , the same as for o ( 1 myr ) .",
    "for the cri+lecr model , in which the lecrs employ a larger energy per supernova , @xmath33 = 0.2 is required to fit the boron isotope data .",
    "the rise in @xmath0b/@xmath1b and b / be with decreasing [ fe / h ] is mostly due to the larger value of the corresponding lecr production ratios .",
    "it is evident from figure  6 that future high precision measurements of @xmath0b/@xmath1b and b / be as functions of [ fe / h ] will distinguish between the models .",
    "figure  7 shows the li evolution .",
    "the crs model underproduces the @xmath3li abundance for [ fe / h]@xmath34 , suggesting the existence of pregalactic or extragalactic @xmath3li sources . with the lower cosmic - ray normalization mentioned above",
    ", the crs model also slightly underproduces the meteoritic @xmath3li . with the discovery of solar flare produced @xmath3li in the solar wind ( via measurements in lunar soil , chaussidon & robert 1999 )",
    ", the possibility of some locally produced @xmath3li in the solar system must be considered .",
    "the cri+lecr model produces more @xmath3li relative to be , simply because the @xmath2@xmath2 cross section for @xmath3li production peaks in the nonrelativistic region .",
    "we have summarized a complete set of o , fe and libeb evolutionary calculation .",
    "we have considered the three principal evolutionary models , cri in which the cosmic - ray source composition at all epochs of galactic evolution is similar to that of the average ism at that epoch , cri+lecr in which metal enriched low energy cosmic rays ( lecrs ) are superimposed onto the cri cosmic rays , and crs in which the cosmic - ray source , accelerated in superbubbles , has a constant composition , independent of the ism metallicity . by considering the evolutionary trend of log(be / h ) vs. both [ fe / h ] and [ o / h ] , we demonstrated that the cri model is energetically untenable .",
    "although the cri+lecr mix considered here is consistent with the be evolution vs. fe , a plausible scenario for producing the required mix has yet to be proposed .    for fe",
    ", our code allows for a delay between nucleosynthesis and deposition into star forming regions due to the incorporation of the synthesized fe into high velocity dust . this delay could provide an explanation for the possible rise of [ o / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] indicated by some of the data",
    "a test for this scenario would be the demonstration that the abundances of refractory @xmath2-elements mg , si , ca and ti relative to fe do not increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] below [ fe / h]@xmath8 , but that volatile sulfur does rise .    for the libeb there is also a delay . due to the transport of the cosmic rays , libeb synthesis lags behind the explosion of the supernova responsible for accelerating the cosmic rays by as much a hundred million years , depending on the average gas density in the halo of the early galaxy .",
    "we show that this delay , combined with the delayed fe deposition , could provide an explanation for the steeper evolutionary trend of log(be / h ) vs. [ o / h ] than vs. [ fe / h ] , as indicated by the recent data of boesgaard et al .",
