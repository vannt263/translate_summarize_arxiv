    "the search for supersymmetric particles and the determination of their masses is one of the main goals of a future @xmath0 linear collider .",
    "especially the use of polarized beams plays an important role for the measurement of the parameters of the underlying supersymmetric model .    in our contribution we study the effects of the selectron masses on the cross sections , polarization asymmetries and decay angular distributions of neutralino production in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "we focus on the production of light neutralinos @xmath1 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite with gut relation for the gaugino mass parameters @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the masses of the left selectron @xmath3 and of the right selectron @xmath4 are both independent parameters of the model .",
    "the motivation for this is that in models with new u(1 ) factors in the gauge group also additional @xmath5-terms appear in the mass terms of the selectrons @xcite .",
    "these @xmath5-terms are of the order of the masses @xmath6 of the corresponding new gauge bosons which results in larger differences between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and even @xmath7 is possible .",
    "the character of the light neutralinos in these extended supersymmetric models which can be motivated by superstring theory @xcite is in most cases very similar to the mssm @xcite .",
    "therefore in the following the selectron mass effects in neutralino production will be discussed in the mssm .",
    "in @xmath0 annihilation the higgsino components of the neutralinos are produced only via @xmath8 channel exchange of @xmath9 bosons whereas the gaugino components are produced only via @xmath10 and @xmath11 channel exchange of selectrons @xcite .",
    "so we choose a scenario @xmath12 of the neutralino parameters where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 gev ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 gev ) have both a large gaugino component ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ) to analyze the selectron mass effects . then the contribution of the @xmath9 exchange can be neglected and for longitudinally polarized beams the total cross section @xcite consists of two terms describing the exchange of left and right selectrons , respectively @xmath19 .",
    "the structure of @xmath20 is @xmath21 f(s , m_{\\tilde{e}_{l / r}})\\ ] ] with the @xmath22 coupling @xmath23 @xcite and the polarization @xmath24 of the electron and positron beam , respectively .",
    "thus the selectron mass effects in the cross section @xmath25 and in the polarization asymmetry for electron beam polarization of @xmath26 @xmath27 depend on the ratio @xmath28 in scenario ( [ scen ] ) with @xmath29 the exchange of @xmath30 dominates",

    "[ fig1](a ) , ( b ) show @xmath31 and @xmath25 for different values of @xmath3 and a fixed value of @xmath4 . because of the dominating @xmath30 exchange @xmath25 drops significantly with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "especially near threshold also @xmath31 strongly depends on @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath32 it is approximately independent of energy @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath34 it tends to the value @xmath35 at threshold , whereas for increasing energy it runs asymptotically to the value for equal masses .",
    "so @xmath31 has different sign near threshold depending on @xmath3 .",
