    "in many situations it is necessary to measure an observable in the presence of noise , e.g. when transmitting a quantum state through a noisy quantum channel that degrades it exponentially versus distance , corresponding to a degradation of the measurement .",

    "an example of such figures of merit is the variance of the outcomes distribution .",
    "an extensive analysis of the variance affecting quantum measurements has been done for example in @xcite . in a communication scenario , a relevant figure of merit",

    "the problem of how much classical information can be extracted from a quantum system has been first deeply discussed by holevo @xcite , who provided bounds on the accessible information , and then revisited in the framework of quantum information by schumacher et al.@xcite .",
    "a further figure of merit is the average probability of correctly distinguishing input states picked up from a given ensemble .",
    "this is one of the first problems faced by quantum estimation theory , and has been addressed extensively in the literature @xcite . finally , another example of figure of merit is a suitable distance between the noisy and the ideal outcomes probability for fixed input states .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the situation where @xmath0 identical preparations of the state @xmath1 belonging to some ensemble @xmath2 are given .",

    "each detector is described by a probability operator - valued measure ( povm ) , namely a set of positive operators @xmath5 , which provides a resolution of the identity , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "each povm element @xmath7 is the noisy version of an ideal povm element @xmath8 .",
    "a generic quantum channel @xmath9 is allowed to act on the @xmath0 identical copies of the state @xmath1 before the @xmath3 noisy povm @xmath5 are measured , and a generic classical post - processing can be done on the outcomes of such measurements .",

    "the limitation of the measurement purification versus error correction is that the decoding @xmath12 is restricted to classical outcomes only .",
