    "since its discovery in 1995 , ( gl 229b ) , a companion to an m dwarf , has been regarded as the prototype t dwarf @xcite .",
    "although many t dwarfs have been found in the field by large surveys such as sdss @xcite , 2mass @xcite , ukidss @xcite and wise @xcite , gl 229b remains as one of the best studied t dwarfs to date .",
    "although the overall energy distribution of gl 229b was reproduced by early model spectra fairly well @xcite , there were discrepancies in detail between the model and observed spectra . by these models ,",
    "the effective temperature was found to be around 900k , but surface gravity and metallicity were poorly known . according to the progress of observations in late 1990 s",
    ", attempts were made to improve the models .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath9 [ m / h ] ) = ( 870k , 4.5,-0.5 ) , ( 940k , 5.0,-0.2 ) and ( 1030k , 5.5,0.0 ) are all acceptable combinations of the parameters , while @xcite claimed that the best fit combination of the model parameters is @xmath9 [ m / h ] ) = ( 1000k , 3.5,-0.5 ) which corresponds to an age of 30 myr . despite the accumulation of more observational data ,",
    "the determination of stellar parameters is far from conclusive . in the mean time",
    ", more and more t dwarfs were discovered , and in 2006 , a unified near - infrared spectral classification scheme for t dwarfs was presented by @xcite . according to this scheme , gl 229b was classified as a t7 peculiar object , and after this classification , gl 229b appears to have been forgotten in the literature .",
    "the metallicity and age of the primary star gl 229a are expected to be the same as those of gl 229b .",
    "the metallicity of gl 229a is controversial and the derived values so far are [ m / h]=+0.15@xmath10 @xcite , -0.2@xmath11 @xcite , and -0.5 @xcite .",
    "the age indicators are the kinematics of the young disk population and stellar activity as a flare star , and based on them @xcite claimed that the age of gl 229a could be as young as 30 myr .    in this paper ,",
    "we apply newly determined carbon and oxygen abundances of gl 229a @xcite to model the atmosphere of gl 229b .",
    "we also reexamine the age of gl 229a from the points of view of the kinematics and stellar activity .",
    "we then give the combinations of the good fit parameters of gl 229b , which satisfy the age constraint .",
    "the details of the determination of carbon and oxygen abundances of m dwarfs including gl 229a are described elsewhere @xcite and a brief summary is given here .",
    "the @xmath1-band echelle spectrum of gl 229a with a resolution of 20,000 was obtained at the subaru telescope , using ircs @xcite with the natural guide star adaptive optics . before the spectral line analysis ,",
    "@xcite calculated the effective temperature and the surface gravity . the effective temperature , @xmath12k was estimated from the newly derived @xmath13 relation , where @xmath14 is the absolute magnitude at 3.4 @xmath15 m based on the @xmath16 @xmath17-band flux and the hipparcos parallax .",
    "the surface gravity was estimated to be @xmath18 using the temperature - radius relation and mass - radius relation derived by @xcite .",
    "the new analysis of spectral lines is based on the fact that pseudo - continua are seen both on the observed and model spectra .",
    "the observed spectrum of gl 229a is depressed by numerous weak lines of h@xmath0o , by which a pseudo - continuum is created . on the other hand ,",
    "both the true- and pseudo - continuum are evaluated on the model spectrum .",
    "the pseudo - continuum on the model spectrum is generated owing to the recent h@xmath0o line database . by analyzing ews of the co lines affected by h@xmath0o contamination on the pseudo - continua of both observed and model spectra , the difficulty of spectral line analysis of the depressed observed continuum can be overcome .",
    "almost all the carbon atoms are in the form of co molecules in the m dwarf atmosphere of gl 229a .",
    "this situation is not changed by the changes of physical condition in the photosphere and this is the reason that the numerous co lines are excellent abundance indicators of carbon .",
    "molecules consume a large portion of oxygen left after the co formation and they are stable in the photosphere of gl 229a . similarly to the determination of carbon abundance from co lines , oxygen abundance is determined from the analysis of h@xmath0o lines .",
    "the resultant carbon and oxygen abundances are @xmath2 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the carbon abundance is higher than the classical high solar abundance of @xmath4 , while the oxygen abundance is slightly lower than the classical high solar abundance of @xmath5 , and the c / o ratio of 0.68@xmath200.12 is slightly higher than the solar value of 0.48 @xcite .",
    "we compare the observed spectrum of gl 229b between 0.8 and 5.1 @xmath15 m obtained from the archive by leggett ( http://staff.gemini.edu/ sleggett / ltdata.html ) with a set of model spectra based on the carbon and oxygen abundances of gl 229a .",

    ", we first use the model spectra in a dust free subset based on the classical c & o abundances ( ca - series based on _ case a _ abundance ) from the database of the unified cloudy models ( ucms : http://www.mtk.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ ttsuji / export / ucm2 ) @xcite .",
    "also we newly prepare a small grid of model photospheres ( without dust clouds ) for the metallicity scaled to the carbon abundance of gl 229a , i.e. all the metals are increased except for he , li and o by @xmath24 dex against the classical solar abundances referred to as _",
    "case a_. the oxygen abundance is kept to be @xmath25 , the value for gl 229a .",
    "we use these abundances to generate model spectra of @xmath26 ( about the same as the resolution of the observed spectrum ) . in the brown dwarf as cool as gl 229b ,",
    "the dust layer lies deep in the atmosphere and there is not significant effect on the photospheric emission @xcite .",
    "therefore the use of dust - free models is justified .    before the comparison of the observed and model spectra",
    ", we first investigate the significance of the effect of the non - solar metallicity of gl 229a on the gl 229b s spectrum by comparing the classical solar metallicity model ( i.e. of @xmath4 & @xmath5 ) with the model with the metallicity of gl 229a for @xmath27=900k and @xmath28=5.0 .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig1 ] reveals that ch@xmath29 bands ( at 1.6 , 2.3 , & 3.5 @xmath15 m ) are slightly stronger while h@xmath0o bands ( 1.4 , 1.8 , & 2.7 @xmath15 m ) are slightly weaker in the model based on the metallicity of gl 229a , as expected for the increased carbon and decreased oxygen .",
    "the differences of the spectra , however , are not very large at the resolution as low as 600 . in the discussion",
    "below , we always use the models with the metallicity of gl 229a , but the differences of the spectra based on the classical solar metallicity and on the metallicity of gl 229a shown in figure [ fig1 ] , generally result in the same model parameters , since the effect of metallicity difference of 0.1 dex or so on the low resolution spectra is rather modest .",
    "thus we confirm that the abundance of gl 229b is not much different from the classical solar abundance , and this is an advantage , since the evolutionary models we use to interpret the spectra @xcite are calculated only for the solar metallicity .",
    "the limitations of the model and observed spectra should also be noted before their comparison .",
    "the @xmath30-band methane absorption in the model spectra is calculated by a band model and the agreement with the observed spectrum at this portion of the spectrum is not so good .",
    "the @xmath1-band methane absorption in the model spectra is calculated by a line list .",
    "however the quality of the line list is not so great and the agreement of the model and observed spectra at this portion ( @xmath31 m ) is not so good either .",
    "the model spectra are based on equilibrium chemistry and a feature related to disequilibrium chemistry , the 4.6 @xmath15 m co fundamental band @xcite is not reproduced .",
    "on the other hand , the co absorption feature in the observed spectrum is very noisy and it can not be analyzed simultaneously with other features .",
    "signal - to - noise ratios at individual data points of the observed spectrum are unknown and the @xmath32 test based on the absolute value of @xmath32 is not possible .    because of the limitations mentioned above , we focus our attention to good portions of the observed and model spectra , namely , wavelength segments at ( @xmath33 m ) , ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 ) and the red wing of @xmath22-band methane feature(@xmath36 m ) for which a line list ( r. freedman , private communication ) is available for modeling .",
    "since we do not know the signal - to - noise ratio of each data point , as proxy for a @xmath32 , we define a relative reduced @xmath32 , @xmath37 by assigning a constant signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath38 as    @xmath39 ^ 2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 indicates the @xmath40th data point and @xmath41 is the number of data points . since @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the standard deviation , which is unknown like @xmath45 .",
    "there is no significance in the value of @xmath45 .",
    "since we are dealing with only one object gl 229b , the usefulness of the relative reduced @xmath37 is justified .",
