    "attractive trapped bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , since their first realization @xcite , have gained increasing attention , due to the interesting phenomena they exhibit @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "a salient feature is the collapse of the condensate when the ( negative ) interacting energy per particle , is too large to be compensated by the kinetic energy .",
    "the attraction brings the bosons so tightly close that the spatial extension of the wave function of the system shrinks to a point and the condensate eventually implodes @xcite .",
    "however , in trapped gases , _ metastable _ states , i.e. , states that remain stable for some finite time , exist .",
    "the metastability of the condensate is a critical phenomenon : if at a given interaction strength @xmath1 , the total number of the bosons exceeds a critical value @xmath5 or vice versa ( see for example @xcite ) , the condensate will collapse .",
    "much work has been devoted to exploring the ground metastable state of attractive becs and its properties ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "recent experiments have revealed new phenomena in attractive becs that seem to go beyond the ground metastable state . in particular , it was found that states with over - critical number of bosons exist @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that excited states of the attractive becs are involved .",
    "furthermore , disagreements have been reported ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) between the experiments and the predictions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory on the critical value of the attraction strength , where the gas collapses .",
    "this motivates us to theoretically study excited states of attractive becs .",
    "we go beyond the standard mean - field ( mf ) theory in the expectation of a thorougher understanding of the role of excited states in the stability of attractive becs .    to describe the statics and dynamics of a condensate one can adopt a mean - field ( mf ) approach , such as the famous gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory .",
    "the starting point of the gp description of a condensate is that all the bosons of the system reside in one and the same one - particle function ( orbital ) @xmath6 and hence the wave function @xmath7 of the system is merely a product of this prototypal orbital : @xmath8 where @xmath0 is the number of particles .",
    "the expectation value of the system s many - body ( mb ) hamiltonian evaluated with this trial function is @xmath9=\\langle\\phi_0|\\hat h|\\phi_0\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the orbital that minizes this expectation value is the optimal orbital and is found to satisfy a non - linear , partial differential equation , the famous gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "however , a gp ansatz is not , by definition , capable of describing fragmentation phenomena .",
    "the relaxation of the assumption that all bosons are condensed in @xmath6 has been found to lead to fruitful results : energetically favourable fragmented states @xcite , excited metastable states with overcritical number of bosons @xcite , fermionized states and new mott - insulator phases @xcite . under this generalized",
    "mf approach the wave function of the system is rewritten as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the symmetrizing operator . in such a description and in contrast to the gp case , @xmath12 orbitals are allowed to be occupied by bosons . within this multi - orbital best mean field ( bmf ) approach @xcite the orbitals @xmath13 of eq .",
    "( [ phi_bmf ] ) as well as their occupations @xmath14 are calculated _ self - consistently _ , so as to minimize the total energy of the system . more specifically , the orbitals @xmath13 are found to satisfy a system of @xmath15 coupled non - linear differential equations , in place now of the gp equation .",
    "the wave function of the system [ eq .",
    "( [ phi_bmf ] ) ] , i.e. , the symmetrized product of @xmath15 different orbitals is sometimes called ` permanent ' , since it can be regarded as the permanent of a matrix ( in direct analogy to the slater determinant ) . a condensate , described by eq . ( [ phi_bmf ] )",
    "is @xmath16 generally @xmath16 a _ fragmented _ @xcite condensate , since the reduced one - particle density matrix will give ` signatures ' in more than one eigenvalues .",
    "so , within the bmf framework fragmented states are well described and a gp state arises as an extreme case , where none but one orbital is occupied by all @xmath0 bosons . some relevant work to the bmf approach , in favour of or against fragmentation of bosonic systems , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "going one step further , we write the wave function ( _ ansatz _ ) of the system as a linear combination @xmath17 of different states @xmath18 ( permanents ) , which are taken from a set @xmath19 of orthonormal permanents @xmath18 , each one describing a condensate ( fragmented or not ) of @xmath0 particles .",
    "this set @xmath19 , which spans our configuration space , consists of all the permanents that result by distributing , in all possible ways , the @xmath0 bosons over the @xmath15 orbitals @xmath13 .",
    "such a state @xmath20 is known as a _ configuration interaction ( ci ) _",
    "expansion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bmf , a ci state @xmath20 can further describe purely mb phenomena , such as depletion and fluctuations of the states .",
    "the coefficients @xmath21 of the above expansion as well as the orbitals @xmath13 are determined variationally .",
    "owing to the detailed analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite there is a formally defined _ multi - configurational hartree _",
    "method for _ bosons _ ( mchb ) and an efficient way to determine the ground and excited states and their energies , i.e. , the whole spectrum of a given hamiltonian in a given configuration subspace of @xmath22 . the expansion coefficients @xmath23 are determined from the diagonalization of the respective _ secular _ matrix @xcite while the one - particle wave functions @xmath13 are obtained by solving a system of @xmath15 coupled non - linear ( integro- ) differential equations @xcite . the mchb theory and its time - dependent counterpart have been successfully applied to a range of problems of one - dimensional ultracold boson gases , predicting various new phenomena @xcite .",
    "however , it is , to this day , not feasible to exactly solve the mchb equations in three - dimensional problems . to overcome this difficulty in the present work ,",
    "as will be later explained , we implement a restricted version of the mchb theory , namely a ci expansion of permanents , built over a one - parametric one - particle functions set .",
    "the complexity of a problem , in the framework of mchb , depends firstly on the number @xmath15 of the one - particle functions , that are to be determined variationally and secondly , on the symmetries of the system , which in general reduce the size of the configuration space . since a _",
    "complete _ configuration space would be infinite - dimensional , the space of the orbitals ( and hence that of the permanents ) has to be truncated and limited down to a relatively small number @xmath15 , so that real calculations can be performed . besides this limitation of the configuration space",
    ", we imply another constraint on the one - particle wave functions @xmath13 ; we suppose that the one - particle states can be well approximated by wave functions @xmath16 _ anstze _ @xmath16 that are completely known , upon some real parameters @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , we fix _ a priori _ the solutions of the system of @xmath15 coupled non - linear differential equations to @xmath15 mono - parametric families of complex wave functions and we then look for the values of @xmath24 that ` optimize ' the solution , i.e. , values that assign an extremal value to the energy functional .",
    "these anstze @xcite are taken in our case after the ( exact ) solution of the corresponding non - interacting system , i.e. , they are scaled gaussians and inherit thus the symmetries of the original system .    in an earlier relevant work @xcite elgary and pethick have derived and used a two - mode mb hamiltonian , borrowed from the nuclear physics lipkin model , to determine the ground state of an attractive trapped bose gas .",
    "the modes correspond to the s - orbital @xmath25 and the p - orbital @xmath26 and the hamiltonian matrix is constructed over the set of permanents @xmath27 , where @xmath28 bosons reside in the s - orbital and @xmath29 in the p - orbital , @xmath0 being the total number of particles .",
    "then , by rewriting the hamiltonian in terms of a _ quasispin operators _ @xmath30 they calculated the population at each mode , in the ground state .",
    "all the configurations @xmath31 are eigenstates of the quasispin operators with quantum numbers @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the ground state , in the range of the parameters where it is not collapsed , was found to be not fragmented .",
    "however the authors did not examine excited states , which as we shall show in our work , can carry angular momentum ( or ` non - minimum quasispin ' in the case of @xcite ) and are metastable fragmented states that survive the collapse .",
    "still , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite has stimulated the present extended and more complete study . by including _ all _ the p - orbitals in our configuration space , we are able to write the wave function of the system as eigenfunction of the true total angular momentum operators and hence restore the symmetries of the problem .",
    "a set of relevant published works , where ultracold bosonic systems are examined with methods beyond the mf approach , includes refs .",
    "@xcite . however they pertain to ( true or quasi- ) two - dimensional systems , where the description of the angular momentum basis is fairly different and simpler than the analysis on a fully three - dimensional system that we present here .",
    "in addition , they do not examine the stability of the system with respect to the fragmentation of ground or excited states .",
    "to render our mb method more efficient we should take all the symmetries of the problem into account .",
    "the one - particle functions set @xmath34 that we use , i.e. , the set of the @xmath24-orbitals , see eqs .",
    "( [ orbitals])-([orb1 ] ) below , consists of functions that have definite orbital angular momenta , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as well as parity ( symmetry under spatial inversion ) .",
    "however one is more interested in the symmetries of the mb states @xmath37 , since these will directly reduce the size of the configuration ( fock ) space .",
    "we principally aim at investigating how the total angular momentum affects the stability and fragmentation of the system .",
    "to achieve this we first have to answer on _ what are the mb states with definite total angular momentum_. we , therefore , define the mb operators @xmath38 and their action on the permanents @xmath18 .",
    "we then look for a @xmath39-basis of mb states that are common eigenstates of @xmath38 .",
    "once the new basis @xmath39 is known we can rewrite the state @xmath20 and the hamiltonian of the system on this basis for given eigenvalues @xmath40 , i.e. , over states with the same symmetry .",
    "in such a way the size of the new , rotated basis set @xmath41 , with the index @xmath42 meaning hereafter that the members of this set have the same angular momentum quantum numbers , is significantly smaller than the original @xmath19 and the calculations are further facilitated ( see also appendix [ appen1 ] ) . we will show that a general state @xmath43 , with definite angular momentum @xmath40 , is a quantum mb state , i.e. , a non mf state .",
    "we should also stress the relevance of the ` yrast ' lines to the present work .",
    "the term ` yrast ' state ( or level ) has been coined to describe the lowest - in - energy states , for a given angular momentum , first in the context of nuclear physics @xcite and much later in the physics of ultracold bose gases @xcite .",
    "herein we do explore the yrast states of attractive systems but we , also , look at the excited , i.e. , non yrast states , for given @xmath40 .",
    "however , the presence of attraction induces a subtle feature . which state ( ground , first excited , etc . ) is accretided with the term ` yrast ' will in principal change , as the absolute value of the interaction strength increases and the lowest - in - energy states start to collapse .",
    "an equally important goal is to examine the stability and the properties of the ground and excited states of different angular momenta of systems of various @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "to do so , we employ the natural orbital analysis ; the findings strongly support that states with angular momentum different than zero [ large or not , depending on the quantity @xmath44 can exist , with a total number of particles well above the critical number of particles @xmath45 , as calculated from the gp theory .",
    "we verify , therefrom , the predictions of the bmf of ref .",
    "@xcite , that fragmented excited states exist and survive the collapse and we explain these features at the mb level .",

    "the hamiltonian of the system is : @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 the many - body interaction operator . in the present work we choose @xmath56 ,",
    "i.e. , the trap potential has spherical symmetry . for the interaction operator we will use the common delta function @xmath57 representation , @xmath58 , where the parameter @xmath1 measures the strength of the interparticle interaction .",
    "this parameter is proportional to the s - wave scattering length @xmath59 and takes on negative values for attractive interaction .",

    "are not known .",
    "hence we will approximate the solution @xmath20 with a mb ansatz as an expansion over known states ( permanents ) @xmath19 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the total number of permanents used in the expansion and @xmath68 the corresponding coefficients .",
    "the question that arises is what the set of mb basis functions @xmath19 consists of .",
    "generally , this includes , as mentioned , all the permanents that result from distributing @xmath0 bosons over @xmath15 orbitals .",
    "readily , these states are those of eq .",

    "mathematically seen , the permanents @xmath70 are the vectors that span the fock space @xmath71 of all @xmath0-body wave functions .",
    "however it is possible to reduce the size of the ` working ' fock spaces , by partitioning the initial space into @xmath72- and @xmath42-subspaces , i.e. , spaces of permanents with definite parity and angular momentum .",
    "the purpose to do so is twofold ; firstly the resulting solution @xmath73 will possess the rotational symmetries of the system and secondly the working @xmath74 spaces are each time much smaller in size than the initial @xmath19 one .",
    "note that , while this partioning of the configuration space with respect to angular momentum @xmath42 is trivial in a two - dimensional system , it is not straightforward in the full 3d case , that we examine here .",

    "the parameters @xmath84 will determine the shape ( width ) of the orbitals ; their optimal values are such that , for a given set of coefficients @xmath78 , the total energy of the system takes an extremum . in this approximative way we restrict the solution of the system to functions that lie inside the monoparametric families of equations , which solve a scaled ordinary schrdinger equation ; the solution of a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations ( mchb equations ) boils down to the determination of a set of parameters which minimizes the total energy .    in this work",
    "much of the analysis of the quantities of the system ( energy per particle , occupation numbers , variances of expansion coefficients ) is done with respect to the scaling parameters .",
    "so for example , we expect to see a ( local ) minimum in the plot of @xmath85 against @xmath83 if the system is metastable , while the absence of minimum will signal a collapsing condensate .",
