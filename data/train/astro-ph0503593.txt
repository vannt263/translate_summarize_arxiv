    "since the discovery of the first jupiter - like planet around 51 pegasi in 1995 , the number of extrasolar planets has exceeded 150 , some of which reside in 14 multiplanet systems @xcite .",
    "extrasolar planetary orbits differ from the solar system s in two ways : first is their semi - major axis distribution .",
    "planets can orbit their parent stars much closer than the tenth of mercury s distance to the sun .",
    "second , at a median value of @xmath1 , their orbital eccentricities are so high that the only solar system analogs are small bodies such as asteroids and kuiper belt objects whose orbits have been strongly stirred up by the gas giants .",
    "these differences are the more puzzling as it has been recognized that the distribution of semi - major axes and eccentricities of extrasolar planets resemble those of spectroscopic binary star systems , a finding that may hint to common formation or excitation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "current theories of planetary formation suggest that jupiter - like planets form in a disk of gas and dust orbiting a parent star .",
    "producing planets with small semi - major axes is a natural outcome of the transfer of angular momentum between the disk and the planet @xcite .",
    "the overall effect of this transfer causes the planet s orbit to shrink around the star .",
    "radial migration can be stopped by the tidal interaction between the planet and the star @xcite or through photo - evaporation of the disk s portion exterior to the planet s orbit and that is responsible for its inward motion @xcite .",
    "the presence of large eccentricities is perhaps the most surprising feature of extrasolar systems as its unexplained origin contrasts with the known ability of the gas disk to force migration .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum between the disk and the planet at the locations of their orbital resonances damps the planetary eccentricity so that the natural outcome of this interaction is a planet on a circular orbit @xcite .",
    "this lead to the investigation of other possibilities : secular perturbations by distant companions @xcite , resonant interactions within a multiplanet system @xcite , and encounters of a spatially extended multiplanet system with passing stars @xcite .",
    "the advantages and drawbacks of these models have been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "the main recurring observation is that these models provide a solution for some specific planetary system .",
    "moreover , they do not explain the apparent uniqueness of the small eccentricities of the solar system s planets , the occurrence of the largest eccentricities in some multiplanet systems for the outer more massive companions , and the origin of the similarity with spectroscopic binaries .",
    "in this regard , it is conceivable to assume that planets formed from a collapsing proto - stellar cloud but this would solve the problem only for the more massive known planets @xcite",
    ".    in this work , we aim to explain these observations within a single framework .",
    "we choose the premise of standard planetary formation theory that the natural outcome of planetesimal accumulation and gas accretion are planets on co - planar circular orbits . to account for the similarity of the eccentricity distributions of extrasolar planets and spectroscopic binaries",
    ", we consider the excitation caused by physical processes that are weakly dependent on the local dynamics of the companion and which can therefore be modeled by an acceleration that does not depend explicitly on the relative position and velocity of the companion . in section 2 , we study the general properties of such an acceleration and show that stellar mass loss phenomena such as jets and winds are natural candidates for the excitation process .",
    "however , we do not specialize in the case of stellar jets because we prefer to present this theory as a phenomenological one .",
    "the reason is twofold : first , the current knowledge of stellar jets and winds both theoretical and observational is not sufficient to issue a definitive verdict on their role in the eccentricity excitation .",
    "second , the dynamical mechanisms that arise because of such accelerations and that lead to eccentricity excitation and apsidal alignment are not concerned directly with the details of jet and wind generation . in section 3",
    ", we demonstrate the basic eccentricity excitation mechanism for the simplest finite duration acceleration , one whose direction is constant with respect to the star - companion system . in the remainder of the paper , we consider the various constraints on the basic acceleration model of section 3 set by : the acceleration s precession ( section 4 ) , the radial migration of the companion ( section 5 ) , the companion s orbital stability and the consistency with the host star s galactic motion ( section 6 ) , the secular perturbations from mutual gravitational interactions in multiplanet systems ( section 7 ) , and the presence of distant companions ( section 8) . the application of this theory to the solar system",
    "is further discussed in section 8 .",
    "section 9 contains concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we discuss the form of the eccentricity generating processes that would apply equally to planetary and stellar companions . to this end , we seek processes that are weakly dependent on the local orbital dynamics of the companions . by this",
    "we mean that the interaction does not depend explicitly on the relative position and relative velocity of the star - companion system . with this in mind",
    ", we note that the simplest way to excite the eccentricity of a companion s orbit is to subject it to a constant acceleration .",
    "stable excitation of the eccentricity is possible if the constant acceleration is smaller than or comparable to the gravitational accelerations between the star and its companions .",
    "writing the perturbing acceleration as @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents its magnitude and @xmath4 is a unit vector , the eccentricity excitation time is proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the keplerian velocity of the companion .",
    "this determines two regions around the host star whether the ratio of the excitation time to the orbital period is larger than or comparable to unity .",
    "the former is located closer to the star as the excitation time decreases with the relative distance of the star to the companion .",
    "we call this region the secular excitation region as the eccentricity increase builds up slowly after each rotation of the companion around the star",
    ". the eccentricity excitation in this case is derived in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the outer boundary of the secular excitation region is the sudden excitation region where the excitation time is comparable to or smaller than the orbital period .",
    "the dynamics in the sudden excitation region is considered in section 6 . with the acceleration magnitudes that we determine below",
    ", the observed planetary companions fall into the secular region . here and",
    "if the perturbing acceleration were strictly constant , the corresponding force would be conservative and the eccentricity excitation would simply result in periodic oscillations between the original value , zero , and some maximum value determined by the parameters of each individual system .",
    "we would require that @xmath3 be finite for a duration comparable to or smaller than the oscillation period induced by the acceleration in order to ensure a finite residual eccentricity . in the secular region ,",
    "the duration is naturally larger than the orbital period of the planet . in the sudden excitation region ,",
    "the duration of excitation can be comparable to or smaller than the orbital period of distant companions and the outer minor bodies of the planetary system in order to ensure stability ( see sections 6 and 8) .",
    "we can obtain a minimal estimate of the acceleration s maximal amplitude , @xmath7 , in the secular region by requiring that the eccentricity excitation time , be shorter than the age of the planetary system @xmath8 years .",
    "this yields : @xmath9 .",
    "the direction of acceleration , @xmath4 , needs to be specified in an inertial frame as the acceleration does not excite the eccentricity of a companion located in the secular region if it is perpendicular to its orbital plane .",
    "the knowledge of the current state of the solar system suggests two options : a local one related to the mean orbital plane of the planetary system , and a global one related to the motion of the system in the galaxy . for the local option , the vector @xmath4 is referred to the total angular momentum of the planetary system or the host star s rotation axis . in the solar system",
    ", we would expect @xmath4 to be closest to the angular momentum direction because of the small eccentricities of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the direction of @xmath4 can be made independent of the planetary planes if it is referred to the sun s rotation axis which is inclined by 6@xmath10 to jupiter s orbital plane normal .",
    "on the scale of a planetary system , the simplest way to achieve an acceleration that is weakly dependent on the dynamics of the companion is by stellar and disk mass loss .",
    "the global option can be motivated by the galactic configuration of the solar system : the planets mean orbital plane is inclined to the sun s orbital plane in the galaxy by the large value of 60 degrees .",
    "jupiter and saturn have small eccentricities compared to most of the known giant planets that are not located in their parent stars tidal zones .",
    "the direction of the acceleration can then be tied to that of the star s motion in the galaxy with the expectation that the largest eccentricities correspond to the situation where the planetary orbital plane is coincident with the parent star s galactic motion plane .",
    "the simplest two options for @xmath4 are a constant vector that lies in the galactic mid - plane and does not depend on the star s motion , and a vector directly related to the star s motion such as its velocity in the galaxy , @xmath11 , or the orthogonal thereof @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant vector . on the larger scale of the solar neighborhood , there are no obvious processes that do not depend explicitly on the relative position and relative velocity of the star - companion system and that would excite the companion s eccentricity .    jets and star - disk winds are ubiquitous features of star formation and star - disk interaction @xcite and are natural candidates for the origin of the perturbing acceleration . inferred mass loss rates for known young t tauri stars lie in the range @xmath14 to @xmath15 and may be two orders of magnitude larger depending on the way the rate is measured from the luminosity of forbidden lines @xcite .",
    "the mass loss process needs to be asymmetric with respect to the companion s orbital plane in order to produce a residual acceleration .",
    "interestingly , a number of bipolar jets from young stars @xcite are known to be asymmetric as the velocities of the jet and counter - jet differ by about a factor of 2 . mass loss processes in young stars therefore yield maximal accelerations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stellar mass and @xmath18 is the outflow s high velocity component .",
    "the implicit proportionality constant depends on the relative mass loss ratios @xmath19 and ejection velocities of the jet and counter - jet .",
    "integrated over the duration of acceleration , the star acquires a residual velocity that must be smaller than its galactic velocity else the star is ejected .",
    "the residual velocity is further bound by the known random component of the stellar motion . in section 8 ,",
    "we further discuss the mass loss rate values after we consider the constraints obtained from the companion s orbital stability and from the eccentricity excitation of multiplanet systems .",
    "another requirement for stellar and disk mass loss to be efficient in the secular region is that the momentum communicated to the star be inclined with respect to the companion s orbital plane as it is the component of the acceleration that lies in the companion s orbital plane that excites the eccentricity",
    ". studies of molecular outflows suggest that some jets precess over timescales from @xmath20 to @xmath21 years @xcite . as most t tauri stars are known to be in multiple systems , a possible way to achieve a jet precession",
    "is by warping the accreting disk s plane through the gravitational perturbation of a stellar companion on an inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "this would not imply that jet acceleration may only explain the large eccentricities of planetary companions in binary systems .",
    "we show in sections 6 and 8 that the acceleration may force the outward migration and possibly the ejection of the stellar companion .    in this paper",
    ", we do not specialize in a specific acceleration generating process and therefore we do not enter into such specific details as asymmetric jet generation and precession by an accreting circumstellar disk tidally interacting with a stellar binary component .",
    "we study the eccentricity excitation by representing the perturbing process by a finite duration acceleration that is independent of the relative position and velocity of the system . in this respect ,",
    "the application of this theory to the efficiency of stellar jets in exciting eccentricities is phenomenological and yields useful bounds on the star - disk mass loss rate .",
    "we point out that the excitation process that is modeled by this acceleration may depend implicitly on the relative position and velocity of the companion .",
    "for instance , the accretion that powers the stellar jet is driven by viscosity which can itself be driven by the planetary embryos through the shocking of the pressure waves they launch in the gas disk @xcite . in this case , the acceleration from the jet will depend implicitly on the companions local dynamics .",
    "the equation of motion is that of the two - body problem modified as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the relative acceleration acting on the star - companion system , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the relative position and velocity , @xmath17 and @xmath26 are the masses of the star and the companion .",
    "the acceleration is finite over a typical duration that we call @xmath27 . for simplicity , we choose the amplitude of acceleration to be one of @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the heaviside unit step function and @xmath7 is the maximum acceleration amplitude .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath7 when we refer to a constant amplitude acceleration .",
    "the connection between the perturbing acceleration and the star s random motion in the galaxy makes the residual velocity , @xmath31 , a relevant parameter in the problem ; it is defined as:@xmath32 for a constant @xmath4 and the two specific forms we use , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we note that it is likely that the companion is subject to radial migration due for instance to the tidal interaction with the circumstellar disk .",
    "the effect of migration on the eccentricity excitation is discussed in section 5 where we modify ( [ motion ] ) to account for migration and show that our conclusions about the eccentricity remain valid in the presence of migration . by using equation ( [ motion ] )",
    ", we also neglect the tidal effect of the galactic potential ; this is justified by the typical sizes of the planetary and stellar systems considered here .",
    "the eccentricity excitation time , @xmath35 , allows us to split the excitation problem into two cases : the first is when the variation of the direction of @xmath23 is small on the scale @xmath35 in which case the direction of @xmath36 can be held constant to a good approximation .",
    "the eccentricity excitation is demonstrated in this case in section 3 .",
    "the second case is when the direction of @xmath23 varies on a timescale comparable or shorter than @xmath35 .",
    "this is the general case of precessing jets which is examined in section 4 .",
    "under the effect of a constant - direction acceleration , @xmath37 , the variation of specific angular momentum , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 . as @xmath4 is constant",
    ", only the projection of the angular momentum along the direction of acceleration , @xmath40 , is conserved .",
    "the rate of change of the angular momentum in the direction orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath4 is obtained from @xmath42 and shows that if @xmath4 lies in the orbital plane , the orbit does not gain inclination with respect to its initial state . to find the eccentricity and inclination excitation of the companion s orbit in the secular excitation region",
    ", we average the equations of motion and in particular the perturbing acceleration over the fast orbital motion of the companion .",
    "this is valid because the excitation time and the acceleration s duration are larger than the orbital period of the companion .",
    "we can therefore assume that the acceleration is independent of time in deriving the secular equations .",
    "a constant acceleration derives from the potential @xmath43 .",
    "its average with respect to the orbital motion is derived in the appendix and reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the eccentricity vector of magnitude @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the orbital semi - major axis .",
    "the last expression is obtained by choosing the @xmath48axis along @xmath4 ; in this case , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the longitude of pericenter , the longitude of ascending node and the inclination of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "the freedom of choosing a vector base in this plane results from the conservation of @xmath52 and leads to the appearance of the combination @xmath53 , the argument of pericenter .",
    "the conservation of @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the initial inclination of the circular orbit , and allows us to reduce the problem to a single degree of freedom with the potential : @xmath57 the eccentricity and pericenter evolution is obtained from @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the companion s mean motion @xcite . in a conservative system where @xmath60 is constant , @xmath46 and @xmath61 follow curves of constant @xmath62 .",
    "there are equilibria at @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath46 is @xmath66 and corresponds to the cycle of initially circular orbits . in figure ( [ fig-1 ] )",
    ", we show the orbits of the conservative case for an inclination @xmath67    for initially circular orbits , the identity @xmath68 leads to @xmath69 or @xmath70 throughout the evolution .",
    "the eccentricity equation then reads : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the sign of @xmath73 which is set by the requirement that @xmath74 . for initially circular orbits , the discontinuous changes of @xmath61 between 0 and 180@xmath10 correspond to the crossing of the plane @xmath75 during the oscillation of @xmath51 between @xmath76 and @xmath56 ; it is the result of the geometric requirement that @xmath77 in standard keplerian variables .",
    "finally , the eccentricity that is excited by the perturbing acceleration is : @xmath78\\ \\sin i_0 \\right| . \\label{eoft}\\ ] ] the inclination is obtained from @xmath79 . in the conservative case , @xmath60 , @xmath46 would oscillate between @xmath80 and @xmath66 at the excitation frequency : @xmath81 examples of such oscillations that were obtained from the direct integration of the full equations of motion are shown in figure ( [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the secular solution and the results numerical integration is perfect and is due to the fact that @xmath3 is independent of the relative position and velocity . to optimize the excitation of a finite eccentricity from an initially circular state , the duration of acceleration needs to be smaller than half the oscillation period : @xmath82 .",
    "a less conservative criterion for eccentricity excitation is that the adiabatic condition , @xmath83 , that would ensure a long term decrease of @xmath46 to zero is not satisfied .",
    "this allows the eccentricity to experience a few oscillations before settling down to a finite value . for multiplanet systems",
    ", this situation leads to strong interactions among the companions which can lead to ejections offering a possible explanation for the existence of many extrasolar planetary systems with one large planet .",
    "examples of eccentricity excitation at three different semi - major axes ( i.e. three different excitation frequencies ) are shown in figure [ fig-3 ] for the two forms of the acceleration s amplitude where @xmath27 has been chosen to yield the same residual velocity @xmath84 and hence the same final eccentricities for each semi - major axis .",
    "figure [ fig-3 ] also illustrates the dependence of the excitation amplitude on the ratio of the duration to the excitation time . we note that because eccentricity excitation in the secular region is a slow process compared to the orbital time , the convolution of the dynamics under the conservative acceleration @xmath7 with a finite time window has the effect of shutting off the excitation at some eccentricity value depending on the duration .",
    "we conclude that the eccentricity @xmath46 can be excited up to @xmath66 and is largest if the initial orbital plane contains the direction of acceleration ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "as @xmath68 for initially circular orbits , the argument of pericenter , @xmath61 , and the longitude of pericenter , @xmath50 , remain at zero .",
    "we show in sections 7 and 8 that this forcing of the pericentre to be aligned with the direction of acceleration favors apsidal alignment in multiplanet system .",
    "the inclination @xmath51 decreases from its initial value pushing the orbital plane away from the direction of acceleration .",
    "we also note a interesting feature of this model that the final eccentricity increases outward so that in multiplanet systems , the farthest planets may have the largest eccentricities .",
    "this is a consequence of the relative strength of the gravitational acceleration and the perturbing acceleration as a function of distance .",
    "the inclination of the direction of acceleration @xmath4 is crucial to the excitation of eccentricity in the secular region .",
    "if the acceleration is due to a stellar jet that precesses , we expect the excitation amplitude to depend on the ratio of the excitation frequency @xmath86 to the precession frequency @xmath87 and that resonant forcing is possible when a match occurs , a situation that is likely since @xmath86 is an increasing function of the semi - major axis @xmath88 . in the following , we solve the conservative excitation problem with precession , that is we choose @xmath89 where @xmath4 rotates at the rate @xmath87 . for this problem , it is more convenient to derive the eccentricity vector and angular momentum evolution with secular perturbation theory in vector form @xcite as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the non - dimensional angular momentum vector . using the secular potential ( [ secpot2 ] ) ,",
    "these equations reduce to : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the rotation vector associated with the precessing acceleration . with precession ,",
    "the constants of motion are given as : @xmath94 to find the excitation under the precessing acceleration , we introduce the two vectors @xmath95 which decouple the equations of motion and yield : @xmath96=c_\\pm \\label{kplusminusdot}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 .",

    "the proximity of @xmath133 to unity increases the denominators of the eccentricity expression ( [ e - jet ] ) which leads to eccentricities close to unity .",
    "the width of the region around resonance where large eccentricity values are reached increases with the jet angle @xmath132 .",
    "these features are illustrated in figures ( [ fig-4 ] ) and ( [ fig-5 ] ) where we plot the expressions ( [ e - jet ] ) and ( [ i - jet ] ) for two jet angles @xmath149 and @xmath150 , an excitation period @xmath151 years , and the four values of @xmath133 : 0.05 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 1 and 50 .",
    "figure ( [ fig-4 ] ) also includes the result of the integration of the full equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) and shows that the solution equations are indistinguishable from the unaveraged numerical solution .",
    "this agreement results from the fact that the acceleration is independent of the relative motion and the relative velocity .",
    "the figures show that the resonance region does not extend far around @xmath138 for a jet angle @xmath149 , as the maximal amplitude for @xmath152 is 0.18 while for @xmath153 the resonance region is much wider .",
    "we note that consistency in the use of the secular potential requires that @xmath133 is not too small or equivalently that @xmath154 .",
    "numerical integrations of the full equations of motion show that the eccentricity and inclination expressions can be used as long as @xmath155 . moreover , as the eccentricity excitation time is @xmath86 , no resonant forcing occurs when @xmath156 in the secular region ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "precession - driven resonant excitation therefore provides a possible way to raise the eccentricity even in low jet angle systems .",
    "if a companion happens to be at or cross the excitation region , because of disk - driven migration , not only that the eccentricity will grow but the planet leaves the disk as its inclination is excited in phase with the eccentricity .",
    "the tidal interaction of the disk with the planet will not prevent the eccentricity excitation if the precession period of the jet , @xmath20 to @xmath21 years @xcite , is shorter than the viscous time of the disk , @xmath158 to @xmath159 years @xcite .",
    "such a situation offers a possible prospect for stopping migration while exciting the eccentricity provided that ( i ) the disk is stable to the perturbing acceleration and that ( ii ) the planet s migration time is longer than the excitation time . these results are discussed further after we constrain the magnitude of the perturbing acceleration in section 8 .",
    "the changes in the orbital semi - major axis @xmath47 of the companion have so far been neglected because in the secular excitation region where @xmath86 is smaller than the mean motion @xmath160 , a constant acceleration will produce small periodic oscillations of the semi - major axis with frequency @xmath160 .",
    "it is possible that radial migration occurs indirectly even for an acceleration that is weakly dependent on the local orbital dynamics .",
    "consider for instance the case where acceleration is caused by mass outflow from the star - disk system .",
    "the planet s orbital revolution is determined by the matter content inside its orbit .",
    "if the total mass of that content varies over timescales larger than the orbital period the conservation of angular momentum leads to the radial migration of the companion but does not affect its eccentricity @xcite leaving initially circular orbits invariant .",
    "this conservation leads to the relation @xmath161 which in the case of mass loss induces outward migration . to estimate the related migration",
    ", we note that the disk s mass inside the planetary companion s orbit is at most several percent of @xmath162 . if all of this mass is ejected from around the star , the companion s semi - major axis expands by a corresponding several percent showing that in this case migration is not significant .",

    "a constant @xmath164 implies an exponential decay of @xmath47 . when the migration time is larger than the companion s orbital period , which is usually the case , the average effect of this drag term conserves the orbit s eccentricity and the planet stays in its initial circular orbit while migrating with respect to the star",
    ".    radial migration would therefore affect the eccentricity excitation only through the variation of the excitation frequency @xmath86 which is where the semi - major axis enters the excitation mechanism .",
    "this is illustrated in figure ( [ fig-6 ] ) where we show an example of the excitation of eccentricity during migration .",
    "for multiplanet systems , the eccentricity excitation can be affected by the migration significantly because the acceleration has to compete with mutual planetary perturbations that tend to precess the planetary orbits at rates that may be faster than the acceleration s excitation frequency .",
    "in order to be stable , a companion s orbit needs to receive greater acceleration from the star than from the perturbation .",

    "these characteristics depend to a certain extent on the direction of acceleration .",
    "a study of the types of motion near the boundary is interesting but not central to the problem of the eccentricity excitation .",
    "we remark that the escape orbits offer an interesting way to expel planets from around their parent stars or equivalently to disrupt a binary stellar system .",
    "if a companion is formed near the keplerian boundary or is pushed out to it by a possibly remaining inner disk that followed photo - evaporation @xcite , it could become unbound .",
    "systems where the acceleration keeps an approximately constant direction during eccentricity excitation loose companions without a risk of catastrophic encounters with the star if the initial direction of acceleration does not lie in the companion s orbital plane such as that of figure ( [ fig-8 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the value of @xmath173 corresponds to the innermost location of the stability boundary because the acceleration s decay decreases @xmath86 and pushes the stability boundary outward .",
    "the acceleration s finite duration may extend the keplerian boundary depending on the ratio of @xmath27 to the excitation time at the keplerian boundary of the conservative problem @xmath183 . when @xmath184 , orbits beyond @xmath173 have enough time to acquire sufficient momentum to escape the gravitational pull of the star .",

    "the previous equation becomes : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the longitude of the companion along its orbit , and @xmath56 is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the direction of the residual velocity @xmath31 .",
    "this equation determines , for a given @xmath31 , the final semi - major axis @xmath191 as a function of @xmath190 and @xmath196 .",
    "we note that @xmath191 can be larger or smaller than @xmath190 because of the inclination term in the energy equation ( [ sudden3 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an inward or outward migration of the companion .",
    "note that when @xmath197 is perpendicular to the initial orbital plane ( @xmath198 ) , migration is always outward .",
    "the second relation is obtained from the conservation of the linear momentum , @xmath199 . for initially circular orbits , the projection of the velocity on the position vector yields : @xmath200 . in the cases that we consider below where the companion is initially at the orbit s nodes ,",
    "@xmath201 implying the conservation of the pericenter distance @xmath202 if migration is outward and the apocenter distance @xmath203 if migration is inward .",
    "this leads to the following relation that is valid at the nodes : @xmath204 elsewhere on the orbit , one needs to express the projections of the linear momentum conservation equation in order to derive the final eccentricity , longitude of pericenter and longitude of ascending node as functions of the longitude @xmath196 .",
    "the third relation comes from the conservation of the projection of the angular momentum on @xmath31 : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the final inclination of the companion .",
    "there are three particular initial semi - major axes that characterize migration : first is @xmath207 , the semi - major axis beyond which the companion can escape at certain longitudes .",
    "second is @xmath208 , the semi - major axis beyond which all companions are lost .",

    "the migration and excitation near the keplerian boundary offers a possible way to transport minor bodies in the solar system ( section 8.2 ) . for planetary companions , the radial migration that results from the interaction with the disk ( section 5 ) has to be added to the migration in the sudden excitation region in order to ascertain the dynamics in the outer keplerian boundary .",
    "the previous study of orbital stability points out similar constraints for the host star that is accelerated in its motion within the galaxy .",
    "stellar jets for instance modify the star s velocity but its galactic motion precludes that @xmath222 be larger than that the galactic acceleration for an arbitrarily extended time else the star is ejected .",
    "the acceleration s duration , @xmath27 , is therefore an important parameter that determines the star s orbital stability .",
    "a limit on @xmath27 can be set by requiring that the residual velocity , @xmath84 , that contributes to the stellar random motion be smaller than the known velocity dispersion , @xmath223 .",

    "in addition , the previous estimate is meaningful for a single acceleration event and does not account for an arbitrary time evolution of the angle @xmath132 .",
    "in section 4 , we showed that the precession of the perturbing acceleration affects significantly its ability to excite the companion s eccentricity .",
    "this is also true if the acceleration does not precess but the system contains multiple companions . in this case ,",
    "mutual gravitational interactions cause the eccentricity vectors to precess and possibly to be locked into resonance .",
    "we expect for instance that if the precession rates are much faster than the excitation frequencies , the maximum eccentricities will be reduced . to illustrate the effects of mutual interactions , we model the jupiter - saturn system under the influence of a constant direction acceleration using a direct integration of the equations of motion .",
    "we assume that the planets formed in initially coplanar circular orbits and that the planetary orbital plane is inclined by 30@xmath10 with respect to the direction of acceleration .",
    "the semi - major axes and masses are taken as @xmath229au , @xmath230au , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",

    "note that the eccentricity amplitudes have a period of @xmath239 years and that there is only one inclination eigenmode due to the freedom of choosing a reference plane for jupiter s orbit .",
    "the evolution associated with mutual planetary perturbations with no external acceleration is depicted in the top panel of figure ( [ fig-11 ] ) where we have ascribed to the two planets their current eccentricities ; the eigenfrequencies of the system are independent of @xmath46 and @xmath51 if these are small .",
    "we assess the effect of mutual perturbation by applying two different acceleration strengths , @xmath240 and @xmath241 , corresponding to the two values @xmath176au and @xmath242au for the location of the keplerian boundary .",

    "the case where both mutual interactions and the perturbing acceleration are turned on is shown in figure ( [ fig-12 ] ) .",
    "the eccentricities of both planets are excited to 0.3 except that saturn s is slightly smaller than jupiter s .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that @xmath245 which implies a smaller eccentricity reduction for jupiter . in the case of saturn",
    ", we have @xmath246 which implies a stronger reduction than observed but the gravitational interaction with a more massive jupiter compensates that effect and forces a larger eccentricity .",
    "the dominant eccentricity oscillation period is modified to @xmath247 years . for @xmath242au , @xmath248 years , @xmath249 years .",
    "these timescales are much larger that the unperturbed eigenperiods implying a strong reduction of the excited eccentricities .",
    "figure ( [ fig-13 ] ) shows that both eccentricities are smaller than 0.01 . the dominant eccentricity oscillation period in this case",
    "is modified to @xmath250 years .",
    "we can find the minimum strength of the constant - direction acceleration that can excite jupiter s eccentricity to its current value 0.05 .",
    "numerical integrations yield @xmath251au corresponding to @xmath252 .",
    "we remark that during the eccentricity and inclination excitation , apsidal alignment is maintained with the libration of @xmath253 and @xmath254 around zero .",
    "this is the result of the forcing of the pericenters to be aligned with the direction of acceleration that we encountered in the basic two - body problem of section 3 .",
    "note however that the inclination oscillation about the direction of acceleration has been largely suppressed . for @xmath176au ( figure [ fig-12 ] ) ,",
    "the two planets inclinations oscillate around @xmath255 with an amplitude of @xmath256 and a mutual inclination of @xmath257 .",
    "we can use this feature as another constraint on the initial strength of the constant direction force by imposing the current mutual inclination of jupiter and saturn of @xmath258 .",
    "numerical integrations yield @xmath259au and @xmath260 with maximal eccentricities for jupiter and saturn of @xmath261 .",
    "we can obtain an additional constraint on the perturbing constant - direction acceleration by deriving its duration .",
    "we do this for the form @xmath262 with the following simplified configuration : @xmath259au ; the eccentricity excitation occurs during the first oscillation cycle ; disk driven radial migration is neglected ; and jupiter and saturn are assumed to have formed at their current locations . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eoft ] ) leads to : @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the current eccentricity for jupiter and @xmath265 years is the excitation period obtained with mutual perturbations . for @xmath266 , @xmath267years and the residual velocity @xmath268kms@xmath218 .",
    "the application of the model to the solar system is further discussed in section 8.2 .",
    "we finally comment that some of the dynamical features that we have shown in this section can be reproduced analytically by applying the laplace - lagrange secular perturbation theory at small @xmath46 and @xmath51 , and combining its second order secular gravitational potential with the linearized acceleration potential ( [ secpot ] ) ( i.e. substituting @xmath51 for sin @xmath51 in that expression ) .",
    "this would yield the linearized eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of the system .",
    "we do not follow this approach because we are interested in large eccentricities and the possible effects of mean motion resonances and close encounters .",
    "the eccentricity excitation theory that we have presented is based on the fact that if a star - companion system is subjected to a relative acceleration that is weakly dependent on the local dynamics , large eccentricities can be achieved .",
    "the theory has the following parameters :    1 .   the magnitude of acceleration , @xmath3 , which determines the excitation frequency of a star - companion system , and the extent of the keplerian region around the main star .",
    "the direction of acceleration , @xmath4 , ( unit vector ) with respect to the initial orbital plane which determines the maximum eccentricity of a star - companion system as the projection of @xmath4 on the orbital plane .",
    "3 .   the rotation vector , @xmath126 , which describes the acceleration s precession whose effect on the eccentricity amplitude and resonant excitation is described in section 4 . 4 .",
    "the duration of acceleration , @xmath27 , which for a given eccentricity amplitude ( larger than required ) permits the selection of the final eccentricity value .",
    "when these parameters are specified , the final orbital state of a planetary or stellar companion can be selected .",
    "the orbital configurations of star systems with a single companion are easier to explain than those with multiple companions because the absence of additional perturbers relaxes the constraints on the acceleration s magnitude or equivalently the size of its keplerian boundary @xmath173 . since stellar jets and star - disk winds are ubiquitous features of star formation and since we have established that they can be dynamically responsible for the eccentricity excitation , the known similarities and differences of the eccentricity distributions of planetary companions and spectroscopic binaries can be attributed to the similarities and differences of the physical environments that give rise to the accelerating mass loss processes and not directly to the companions formation or their dynamical interaction with the gas disk . in this regard , it would be interesting to be able to associate , for stars of a similar spectral type , similar residual velocities that reproduce the observed companion eccentricities .",
    "the excitation theory is built on a minimal assumption that the perturbing acceleration is explicitly independent of the local dynamics the basic excitation mechanism ( section 3 ) relies on a constant acceleration that is applied for a finite duration . as a result , multiplanet systems as well as planetary systems of binary stars put strong constraints on the acceleration s parameters .",
    "once these parameters are specified , a single relative acceleration is applied to all companions , planetary and stellar alike , and sets the fundamental excitation frequencies and amplitudes of the system .",
    "these frequencies are influenced by the mutual perturbations of the companions as shown in section 7 .",
    "in particular , the larger the companions number , the more constrained the acceleration s parameters . in section 8.1",
    ", we illustrate this situation with the @xmath0 andromedae binary system which contains multiple planets and a distant stellar companion whose observed location strongly constrains the acceleration s strength .",
    "the application of this theory to the known sample of multiplanet systems is beyond the scope of this paper but it is ultimately the best way to ascertain whether the acceleration mechanism is responsible for the eccentricities of extrasolar planets .",
    "two effects need to receive particular attention : the companions possible radial migration which changes the fundamental excitation frequencies as seen in section 5 , and the companion s secular perturbations which circulate the eccentricities .",
    "radial migration can be prescribed by the standard disk - planet interaction theories @xcite .",
    "the effect of secular perturbations may be disentangled by determining for a given multiplanet system the amplitudes of the secular modes from observed eccentricities and seeking the acceleration parameters that reproduce the amplitudes of the secular modes and not the observed eccentricities .",
    "this procedure would be useful for similar mass planets because the instantaneous eccentricities can be different from the individual secular mode amplitudes .",
    "the combination of both migration and secular perturbations relaxes some of the constraints on the model because of the additional freedom in the choice of the frequencies of the secular modes .",
    "such an analysis may help elucidate the eccentricity - mass correlations of extra - solar planets . in the following ,",
    "we further illustrate how to constrain the acceleration mechanism in the case of the @xmath0  andromedae system ( section 8.1 ) and discuss the relevance of these results to the solar system ( section 8.2 ) .",
    "three planets orbit @xmath0  andromedae @xcite , two of which have their apsides aligned @xcite .",
    "the most recent observations of this system @xcite yield the following orbital elements @xmath269au , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273au , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277au , @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 where the masses are line - of - sight values , the stellar mass is @xmath281 .    using the numerical integration of the full equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) to model the eccentricity excitation with a constant - direction acceleration applied to the planetary orbits with their current semi - major axes but with initially circular co - planar orbits",
    ", we find that mutual planetary perturbations are strong enough to damp the excitation if the acceleration is smaller than @xmath282 .",
    "the equivalent keplerian boundary is at @xmath283au . below this value",
    ", the present configuration can be recovered along with the apsidal alignment of the outer two planets .",
    "however , the stellar companion to @xmath0  andromedae @xcite puts an additional constraint on the excitation mechanism . at a projected distance of 750au ,",
    "the presence of this @xmath284 companion leaves us two options : either the excitation by acceleration is ruled out because the companion lies far outside the keplerian boundary of the weakest possible acceleration that reproduces the planets eccentricities , or that it was initially inside the boundary and migrated by the sudden excitation that we discussed in section 6 .",
    "we point out that the projected distance of 750au does not translate necessarily into a semi - major axis as the companion s orbit is likely to be eccentric .    to test the second option , we choose an acceleration of the form @xmath221 with a conservative keplerian boundary at @xmath285 au corresponding to @xmath286kms@xmath287 , a duration @xmath288years and an equivalent residual velocity @xmath289kms@xmath218 .",
    "the planetary angular momentum is inclined by @xmath290 with respect to the direction of acceleration .",
    "the stellar companion s initial orbit has a semi - major axis @xmath291au , an eccentricity @xmath292 and an inclination of @xmath293 with respect to the direction of acceleration . at this large semi - major axis ,",
    "the stellar companion s perturbation of the planets is negligible ; in particular , the eccentricity excitation by the kozai mechanism @xcite is not efficient because the corresponding excitation time ( @xmath294years ) is much larger the duration of acceleration and the eccentricity secular frequency of the isolated two - planet system ( @xmath295 years ) .",
    "we have chosen such an eccentric and inclined stellar orbit to decouple the problem of eccentricity excitation for the planetary and stellar companions .",
    "we find that the acceleration produces a configuration similar to the observed one with stellar orbital elements : @xmath296 , @xmath297au , @xmath298 ( figure [ fig-14 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we remark that the apsidal alignment that is generic in the basic mechanism of section 3 for two bodies is maintained in the @xmath0 andromedae system .",
    "we also note that only when the acceleration s strength is near maximum and the keplerian boundary nears 300au , does the orbit acquire a larger eccentricity .",
    "the numerical integration also confirms the absence of the kozai eccentricity perturbations in the orbits evolution as suggested by the timescale analysis .",
    "the acceleration s magnitude of @xmath299kms@xmath287 corresponds to a jet - driven mass loss rate @xmath300year@xmath218 .",
    "this value is within the two orders of magnitude uncertainty in mass loss estimation ( section 2 ) .",
    "however , the inferred rate is a maximal value in time ( e.g. figure [ fig-14 ] ) and can not be compared directly to the observed steady state values which are naturally smaller .",
    "an additional constraint on the excitation by jet acceleration is that the planet must not lie far inside the resonance location . in terms of the parameters we introduced , the resonant semi - major axis of the precessing jet",
    "is given as : @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the jet s precession period .",
    "this estimate shows that the most efficient accelerating jets precess with periods of @xmath21 years or larger .",
    "if the precession angle is large as it is the case here , then the large eccentricity region is extended inside the resonant semi - major axis by a sizable factor ( e.g. figure [ fig-5 ] with @xmath153 ) . at @xmath303 ,",
    "maximum amplitude is 0.17 for @xmath304 .",
    "this simple example allows us to conclude that stellar - disk mass loss is a possible process to provide acceleration .",
    "further modeling of jet acceleration with a more realistic amplitude time variation is needed to constrain the excitation mechanism .",
    "the solar system was used in our model to motivate the possible options of the direction of acceleration using the small eccentricities of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the detailed analysis of the excitation by acceleration pointed out other ways to limit the eccentricity growth : to the maximum eccentricity set by the inclination of the acceleration with respect to the orbital plane , we add the amplitude reduction associated with a precessing acceleration and that associated with a weak acceleration ( @xmath305au with @xmath182 constant ) that competes with mutual planetary perturbations .",
    "these options show that it is more difficult to identify the evolutionary track of low eccentricity systems .",
    "modeling the migration of the solar system s planets and its effects on minor bodies under a perturbing acceleration may offer a way to discriminate between the available options .",
    "the current state of the giant planets orbits is believed to have evolved from a much more compact system .",
    "studies of the origin of the eccentricity and inclination distributions of kuiper belt objects suggest that the four giant planets were confined between 5.5au and 13.5au at the time where the kuiper belt was made up of a low eccentricity and inclination planetesimal disk @xcite . for such compact configurations , mean motion resonance crossing may produce eccentricities comparable to the current values for jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "regardless of the specifics of such mechanisms and if we admit that accelerating processes of the type studied here excited companion eccentricities for solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood , the same processes must have applied to the solar system and shaped it to a certain extent . in the context of acceleration by stellar jets and star - disk winds , the inclination of jupiter s angular momentum vector by @xmath306 with respect to the sun s rotation axis is an indication that jupiter s orbital plane has had to evolve from an equatorial accretion disk or that the planet had formed in a warped disk .",
    "both possibilities are favorable to the excitation by acceleration model .",
    "an interesting application of our model that does not require modifying the standard picture of how the solar system and its minor body populations have evolved is to choose the direction of acceleration nearly perpendicular to the planetary orbital plane .",
    "the acceleration , however , may not be particularly weak thereby allowing smaller values of @xmath173 .",
    "the main consequence of such an acceleration is to excite the eccentricities of bodies that lie near the keplerian boundary , eject those that lie far outside it , thus truncating the planetesimal disk , and outward transport those in its vicinity through the migration that we discussed in section 6 and illustrated in figures ( [ fig-9 ] ) and ( [ fig-10 ] ) .",
    "migration could enhance the delivery of minor bodies to the oort cloud and explain the transport of kuiper belt outliers 2000 cr105 and sedna ( 90377 ) that , with perihelia larger then neptune s semi - major axis , still elude dynamical explanation @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have worked towards building a theory for the origin of the eccentricities of extrasolar planets . proceeding with minimal assumptions",
    ", we showed that the planetary eccentricities can be caused by relative accelerations that depend weakly on the local dynamics .",
    "we have thus reduced the problem of the origin of eccentricities to the identification of the physical processes that cause such accelerations .",
    "possible processes are stellar jets and star - disk winds that accelerate the host star with respect to the companion and excite the random component of its galactic velocity .",
    "the origin of extrasolar eccentricities can therefore be related to the the random motion of disk stars in the galaxy .",
    "the model has further applications to the dynamics of extrasolar planets and the solar system .",
    "if the duration of acceleration is larger than the excitation time at some semi - major axis , planets exterior to this radius will achieve maximum eccentricity and risk ejections by close encounters ( section 3 ) .",
    "this offers a possible explanation for single planet systems with large eccentricities .",
    "rogue planets can also be produced if planets are pushed out to the keplerian boundary by disk - planet interaction ( section 6 ) .",
    "for the solar system , besides the possible eccentricity excitation , acceleration leads to the transport of minor bodies to the outer kuiper belt and the oort cloud .",
    "the excitation by acceleration model can be applied in other contexts beside the stellar and planetary and companions .",
    "the star - disk mass loss mechanisms , that can be responsible for the eccentricity of extrasolar planets , impart an equal acceleration to the protoplanetary disk .",
    "a precessing acceleration derives from the perturbing potential @xmath307 where @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 are the acceleration s components in a cylindrical coordinate system referred to the disk .",
    "this potential could be able to excite the @xmath311 slow modes of the disk @xcite .",
    "such modes are interesting because of their large wavelength that can be comparable to the size of the system . for instance , the disk could develop rigid precession if the speed of sound waves is larger than the precession rate similarly to the case of tilted disks perturbed by a binary component @xcite . the feedback of a jet - generated precessing acceleration on the disk may have important consequences for sustaining the acceleration .",
    "the excitation mechanism also applies to galactic dynamics .",
    "large - scale wind phenomena @xcite accelerate the galaxy and alter the galactic rotation curve by decreasing the circular velocity . the analysis of this paper can be modified to ascertain the efficiency of galactic winds in the excitation of the stellar random motion by substituting the galactic potential for the stellar potential in equation ( [ motion ] ) .",
    "further applications of galactic winds include the stability of large scale structures in disk galaxies , the onset of @xmath311 elliptic distortions , and the effect of the change in the sun s hill sphere in the galaxy on the dynamics of the oort could .",

    "in the following , we derive the averaged potential of a constant acceleration @xmath23 .",
    "the acceleration ( or equivalently its force ) derives from the potential @xmath43 where @xmath24 is the position vector .",
    "the averaged potential is @xmath312 and therefore only the average of the position vector @xmath24 needs to be calculated .",
    "the companion s unperturbed orbit is keplerian and in an orthonormal basis can be written as : @xmath313 where the radius is @xmath314 and the orbital elements @xmath315 , and @xmath50 are respectively , the semi - major axis , the true anomaly , the eccentricity , the argument of pericenter , the inclination and the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "the time average can be replaced with a true anomaly average by using the conservation of angular momentum @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the period . applying this integration to the position vector",
    "gives : @xmath318 the direction of @xmath24 at @xmath319 is that of the eccentricity vector ( or runge - lenz vector ) , @xmath320 .",
    "the averaged potential is therefore : @xmath321 inspection of the position vector equations shows that the simplest expression corresponds to choosing the @xmath48-axis as the direction of acceleration .",
    "this leads to @xmath322 where @xmath323 is the longitude of the pericenter , the conjugate variable of the eccentricity , @xmath46 ."

    "<S> we develop a phenomenological theory that aims to account for the origin of the large eccentricities of extrasolar planets and that of the small eccentricities in the solar system , the preference for apsidal alignment in non - resonant multiplanet systems , and the origin of the similarities in the eccentricity distribution of extra - solar planets and that of spectroscopic binary stars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if a physical process is weakly dependent on the local dynamics of the companion and imparts a small relative acceleration to the star - companion system , the eccentricity of the companion s orbit is excited to large values depending on the direction and duration of acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> a natural candidate for such processes are asymmetric stellar jets and star - disk winds . </S>",
    "<S> when the acceleration originates from a precessing jet , large eccentricities can be excited by the resonance of the jet s precession frequency with the induced acceleration s excitation frequency even for nearly perpendicular jets . </S>",
    "<S> precession also reduces the eccentricity amplitude far inside the resonance radius . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration s strength is best constrained in multiplanet systems because of the companions mutual gravitational perturbations , while the acceleration s duration is bounded by the condition that the residual velocity imparted to the star is smaller than the stellar velocity dispersion in the galaxy . in the outer parts of the star - companion system where the acceleration excitation time is comparable to or smaller than the orbital period , significant radial migration takes place which may have important consequences for the dynamics of the minor body populations in the solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is illustrated with the @xmath0  andromedae binary system . </S>"
