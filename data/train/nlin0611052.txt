    "vortices have been a source of fascination since the works of empedocles , aristotle and descartes , who tried to explain the formation of the earth , its gravity and the dynamics of the solar system as due to primordial cosmic vortices .",
    "many interesting problems related to vortices are open in different fields such as fluid mechanics , superconductivity , superfluidity , light propagation , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , cosmology , biosciences , or solid state physics @xcite .    in wave mechanics",
    "a vortex is a screw phase dislocation , or defect @xcite , where the amplitude of the field vanishes .",
    "the phase around the singularity has an integer number of windings , @xmath0 , which plays the role of an angular momentum . for symmetric systems ,",
    "this number is a conserved quantity and governs the interactions between vortices as if they were endowed with electrostatic charges .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is usually called the _ topological charge _ of the defect .",
    "angular momentum is conserved in a quantum system with o(2 ) rotational symmetry .",
    "if we consider a state with well - defined angular momentum @xmath1 , i.e. , an eigenfunction of the angular momentum operator at a given time @xmath2 , its evolution will preserve the value of @xmath0 . in a system possessing a discrete point - symmetry ( described by the @xmath3 and @xmath4 groups )",
    "the angular momentum is no longer conserved .",
    "however , in this case one can define another quantity @xmath5 , the bloch or angular pseudo - momentum , which is conserved under time evolution @xcite .",
    "the angular pseudo - momentum @xmath6 plays then the role of @xmath0 in a system with discrete rotational symmetry . from the group theoretical point of view , the angular momenta and pseudo - momenta , @xmath0 and @xmath6 , are also the indices of the 2d irreducible representations of o(2 ) and @xmath3 , respectively @xcite . unlike @xmath0 ,",
    "the values of @xmath6 are limited by the order of the point - symmetry group @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of vortices is one of the signatures of superfluidity and this is why in the field of bose - einstein condensation , they have attracted so much interest .",
    "they can be generated in rotating traps @xcite or by phase imprinting methods @xcite .",
    "the later procedure allows to generate only multiply charged vortices with topological charges @xmath7 .    in the last years",
    "there has been an enormous interest on the applications of group theory to study the properties of defects in media with discrete symmetries including photonic crystals , periodic potentials with discrete symmetries , etc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore the application of group theory to control the topological charge of vortices in bose - einstein condensates by using external potentials with discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "to do so we propose a simple setup based on a non - periodic potential with discrete rotational symmetry which will allow us to perform many operations with the vortex charges depending on the initial charge and the potential symmetry order . while the vortex transmutation has been previously explored in potentials with broken symmetries @xcite and in the context of photonic lattices @xcite ,",
    "other operations to be proposed here have not been studied before .",
    "our proposal is simpler to implement than the 2d lattice type potentials proposed in the framework of photonic lattices @xcite and is easier to reconfigure .",
    "we will also show how starting from multiply charged vortices such as the ones which can be generated in atom chips by phase - imprinting methods @xcite one can generate different types of vortices by choosing an appropriate control potential .",
    "our plan is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we present the theory in which our methodology is based . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we present several examples .",
    "first we present our specific setup in sec .",
    "[ pra ] and then discuss several phenomena which can be achieved such as : topological charge erasing ( sec . [ erase ] ) , and two examples of topological charge inversion from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( sec .",
    "[ single ] ) and @xmath10 to @xmath9 ( sec .",
    "[ minusingle ] ) .",
    "in this paper we will consider a bose - einstein condensate with tight confinement along an specific direction ( @xmath11 ) leading to a quasi - two dimensional bose - einstein condensate . under the effect of an additional external potential @xmath12",
    "this system is ruled in the mean field limit by an effective gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite @xmath13 in dimensionless units and where @xmath14 is a measure of the effective nonlinearity .",
    "the symmetry of the potential induces strict restrictions on the vorticity of stationary solutions of eq.([nls ] ) . in order to illustrate this statement ,",
    "let us consider the equation for stationary solutions , which is a nonlinear eigenvalue equation of the following type : @xmath15 where the nonlinear hamiltonian operator depends on the field itself , i.e. , @xmath16 the nonlinear solution @xmath17 can be considered as a self - consistent solution .",
    "it appears as an eigenstate of the hamiltonian but , at the same time , it defines the hamiltonian operator itself since @xmath18 depends on it through the nonlinear term @xmath19 .",
    "one can establish necessary conditions for the existence of stationary symmetric solutions of eq.([snls ] ) based on the symmetry properties of the potential @xmath12 .",
    "they will exhibit special features due to the nonlinear nature of the hamiltonian operator @xmath20 .",
    "we can summarize the properties of these solutions in a single statement : ( i ) if the potential @xmath21 is invariant under a point symmetry group that we refer to generically as @xmath22 i.e .",
    ", @xmath22 describes finite two - dimensional @xmath23 rotations around an axis ( @xmath24 group ) and specular reflections ( @xmath25 group) and ( ii ) if we search for symmetric solutions fulfilling the condition @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is any element of the group @xmath22 ) , then the solution @xmath17 must belong to some representation @xmath28 of the symmetry group @xmath22 or to some of their subgroups @xmath29 . since this statement is rather mathematical ,",
    "it is convenient to analyze it in the light of the symmetry properties of the nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "first of all , let us recall that if @xmath17 is a given stationary solution @xmath30 satisfying eq.([snls ] ) then @xmath31 plays two different roles in this nonlinear eigenvalue equation .",
    "on the one hand , @xmath31 defines the hamiltonian operator @xmath32 whereas , on the other hand , it appears as an eigenfunction of the same operator .",
    "this two - fold role has profound implications on the allowed functional form of the solution .",
    "the first consequence of the explicit , and specific , dependence of the nonlinear hamiltonian on @xmath31 is that @xmath32 inherits the symmetry of the potential .",
    "this is a consequence of assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) . since the laplacian operator is invariant under any type of rotation @xmath33 and , on the other hand , @xmath34 and @xmath35 because of the previous assumptions , the nonlinear hamiltonian evaluated at @xmath36 is automatically invariant under the symmetry group @xmath37 : @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that the hamiltonian operator evaluated at @xmath31 is invariant under the group @xmath37 implies that @xmath32 commutes with all elements of this group , i.e. , @xmath39=0 $ ] @xmath40 and , therefore , according to standard quantum mechanics arguments , all its eigenfunctions must belong to the different representations of the symmetry group @xmath22 . at this point , we have considered @xmath31 only in its role of generator of the nonlinear hamiltonian operator .",
    "however , in its second role @xmath31 must also appear as an eigenfunction of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 must belong to some of the representations of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 indicates the representation characterized by the representation index @xmath6 and the degeneracy index @xmath43 .",
    "the degeneracy of the representations of the point symmetry groups @xmath24 and @xmath25 is either one or two @xcite . one dimensional representations automatically fulfill the symmetry condition for the amplitude @xmath26 assumed in ( ii ) since they do not transform , except for a sign , under the action of a finite rotation : @xmath44 .",
    "the requirement of amplitude invariance is , however , trickier for two - dimensional representations .",
    "let us see next why .",
    "a natural basis for a two - dimensional representation of a point symmetry group is that formed by the eigenvectors of the group operator in such representation , i.e. , that given by the two functions @xmath45 fulfilling @xmath46 and its complex conjugate , @xmath6 being the representation index and the eigenvalue being given by @xmath47 . since a group rotation operator acting on this representation",
    "will be represented by a @xmath48 matrix this two vectors provides the basis where this matrix is diagonal .",
    "however , the more general form of a function belonging to the @xmath6-representation will be given by a linear combination of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this general solution has a problem with respect to the requirement of invariance for the amplitude assumed in ( ii ) . indeed ,",
    "in the most general case in which we consider arbitrary coefficients , this linear combination does not verify the previous condition and thus such a function would be excluded as a solution of the problem enjoying symmetry under the full group @xmath22 ( however , it can fulfill the condition for a subgroup @xmath51 , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in this two - dimensional subspace the only two functions fulfilling the condition are the eigenvectors of the @xmath27 operator @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is so because the eigenvalue @xmath52 is a pure phase number and therefore with unit modulus .",
    "consequently , only @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be nonlinear solutions of eq.([snls ] ) .",
    "this fact is in remarkable contrast with respect to the linear case in which all linear combinations belonging to the representation appear as solutions of the eigenvalue equation .",
    "notice that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 complex solutions represent a vortex - antivortex soliton pair of topological charge @xmath6 and @xmath53 respectively . in order to interpret this result on a more physical basis",
    "it is convenient to re - write the action of a discrete rotation of order @xmath54 on these functions using polar coordinates : @xmath55 and its complex conjugate . as it was recognized in ref.(@xcite ) , this condition is identical to that fulfilled by one - dimensional bloch modes but by substituting a standard non - compact spatial coordinate by the compact angular one @xmath56 . for this reason the most general form for such solutions",
    "are that corresponding to angular bloch modes : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an invariant function under @xmath23 rotations and @xmath6 plays the role of  angular \" pseudo - momentum satisfying the following constraints : @xmath59 ( if @xmath54 is even ) and @xmath60 ( if @xmath54 is odd ) . since @xmath6 is also a representation index , these constraints",
    "can be explained using group theory arguments @xcite .",
    "however , it is physically more intuitive to interpret them by means of the properties of the angular pseudo - momentum in an equivalent bloch problem in terms of the angular variable @xmath56 .",
    "the symmetry condition of the potential under @xmath54th - order rotations @xmath61 is understood as a periodicity condition in the angular variable @xmath56 with period given by @xmath62 .",
    "as we have seen , this periodicity property is inherited by the full hamiltonian @xmath20 when @xmath17 fulfills the symmetry condition @xmath63 ( assumption ( ii ) ) . since the full hamiltonian is periodic it is then natural that their solutions transform as in eq.([transformation_property ] ) and they present the angular bloch form ( [ bloch_modes ] ) .",
    "the role of @xmath6 is therefore that corresponding to the conjugate variable of the periodic variable @xmath56 , hence its name of  angular \" pseudo - momentum .",
    "the angular nature of @xmath56 forces @xmath6 to be an integer in order to preserve the single - valuedness of the wavefunction @xmath17 .",
    "energy is a periodic function of pseudo - momentum with periodicity given by the so - called reciprocal lattice vector @xmath64 , which determines the existence of equivalent zones in pseudo - momentum space called brillouin zones . in this framework",
    "the constraints in the values of @xmath6 arise from the fact that all possible solutions can be reduced to those existing in the first brillouin zone in pseudo - momentum space , i.e. , those fulfilling @xmath65 , which is equivalent to the aforementioned constraints . as an example , in fig.[bloch_structure ] it is represented the angular bloch structure of energy eigenstates of two systems owning discrete symmetry of @xmath66th and @xmath67th order .",
    "notice that the period of the brillouin zone i.e . , the reciprocal lattice vector is equal to the order of symmetry ( @xmath68 ) and that the allowed angular pseudo - momenta fullfill the condition @xmath69 corresponding to the first brillouin zone . in this scenario",
    "it is rather intuitive to understand what happens to a solution carrying angular momentum @xmath70 evolving in a medium characterized by full rotational invariance given by the @xmath71 group when we suddenly switch on a potential that breaks full rotational symmetry into a discrete - symmetry of @xmath54th order given by the @xmath24 group . in terms of the angular variable",
    "@xmath56 the solution with angular momentum @xmath70 behaves like a sort of  angular \" plane wave @xmath72 since the amplitude @xmath73 is angle - independent .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath70 plays the role of ordinary ( discretized ) momentum .",
    "the problem is thus equivalent to that of a plane wave propagating in a constant potential in @xmath56 , since @xmath74 is angle independent that , at some specific moment @xmath2 , feels the presence of a periodic potential @xmath75 . at @xmath2",
    "the wavefunction corresponding to the initial angular plane wave must excite the spectrum of the nonlineal operator @xmath76 .",
    "however , the full potential @xmath77 is no longer @xmath71-invariant but @xmath24-invariant due to the breaking of continuous symmetry by the appearance of the discrete - symmetry potential @xmath78 at @xmath2 and whose eigenstates are angular bloch modes of the form ( [ bloch_modes ] ) .",
    "this fact implies that there must be a matching between the input angular momentum and the angular pseudo - momenta of allowed angular bloch states after the @xmath24 interaction is switched on . in other words ,",
    "the initial angular momentum @xmath70 carried by the angular plane wave @xmath72 must match the angular pseudo - momentum @xmath6 of some angular bloch state .",
    "if @xmath79 the initial angular momentum can always match an angular pseudo - momentum in the first brillouin zone and , consequently , @xmath80 .",
    "however , if @xmath81 we excite angular bloch states in higher - order brillouin zones which , on the other hand , we know are equivalent to those in the first brillouin zone .",
    "this equivalence is given by periodicity in pseudo - momentum space which is provided by the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath64 in such a way two pseudo - momenta are equivalent if they differ from each other by a multiple of this vector .",
    "this establishes the desired matching condition for angular pseudo - momentum in terms of the initial angular momentum @xmath70 : @xmath82    this matching condition can be easily visualized in fig.[bloch_structure ] for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 cases . when @xmath83 and @xmath85 we can always find bloch states in the first brillouin zone with the same value of the angular pseudo - momentum @xmath86 .",
    "this is the case of the input angular momentum @xmath87 represented in fig.[bloch_structure](a ) .",
    "for @xmath84 the situation is similar , i.e. , we excite angular bloch states with @xmath86 as long as @xmath88 ( see fig.[bloch_structure](b ) ) .",
    "however , when this condition is not fulfilled ( @xmath89 ) we excite an equivalent bloch state with different angular pseudo - momentum in the first brillouin zone .",
    "let us choose , for example , the input angular momentum to be @xmath90 in the @xmath84 case .",
    "we immediately see that we are exciting an equivalent bloch state with different angular pseudo - momentum in the first brillouin zone given by @xmath91 , in agreement with the matching condition ( [ matching_condition ] ) .",
    "the previous considerations refer to angular pseudo - momentum and thus they are related to the way the wavefunction transform under discrete rotations ; i.e. , in the way described by eq.([transformation_property ] ) . using analogous arguments as those appearing in ref.@xcite",
    ", it can be proven that the angular pseudo - momentum is conserved during time evolution .",
    "this means that if we start at the initial time @xmath2 with a solution fulfilling eq.([transformation_property ] ) , this solution will preserve this property during evolution provided no new alteration in the symmetry of the potential is given .",
    "in other words , if the initial angular pseudo - momentum is @xmath6 at @xmath2 it will remain the same at any other time @xmath92 .",
    "this property has been numerically checked in optical vortex transmutation phenomena @xcite .",
    "when , besides having a solution with angular pseudo - momentum @xmath6 , we are dealing with a function characterized by a single - phase singularity the angular pseudo - momentum @xmath6 becomes identical to the topological charge @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the irreducible representations in @xmath4 are either one or two dimensional .",
    "this statement is based in group theory arguments or can be deduced directly from inspection of the bloch functional form ( [ bloch_modes ] ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath54 is even , the dimension of the representation is one for @xmath93 or @xmath94 , while it is of dimension two for @xmath95 . and",
    "if @xmath54 is odd , the dimension of representation is one for @xmath93 , while it is two for @xmath96 .",
    "since one dimensional representations do not transform under rotations except for a sign , they are necessarily real . on the other hand , two dimensional representations present a non trivial phase structure .",
    "thereby , only solutions belonging to two dimensional irreducible representations can be considered as vortex solutions .",
    "notice that , as stated previously , the base for these two dimensional irreducible representations is the complex pair @xmath49 and @xmath50 of vortex - antivortex soliton solutions .    according to these statments and to the matching condition ( [ matching_condition ] )",
    "there are different kinds of vorticity transformations between @xmath71 and @xmath4 media . for @xmath70 in the first brillouin zone no transformation is produced . for @xmath70 outside the first brillouin zone",
    "there are two kinds of transformation : i ) if the value of @xmath6 that corresponds to the input @xmath70 according to the matching condition ( [ matching_condition ] ) is such that the solution belongs to a irreducible representation of dimension one , the phenomenon is called _ charge erasing _ and ii ) if @xmath6 is such that the related representation is a two dimensional one , the phenomenon is called _ vortex transmutation_. moreover , there are two kinds of vortex transmutation phenomenon : i ) charge downconversion if @xmath6 has the same sign that @xmath70 and ii ) charge inversion if @xmath6 has different sign that @xmath70 . for example , in in fig.[bloch_structure](a ) a case of charge erasing is presented . on the other hand , the fig.[bloch_structure](b ) represents a charge inversion .    this remarkable fact can be used to exploit the angular pseudo - momentum matching condition ( [ matching_condition ] ) as a way to control the topological charge of matter wave vortices , as it will demonstrated extensively in the next sections .",
    "in order to work with the minimal configuration showing the phenomena to be described here we have made the simplifications of taking the linear limit @xmath97 and chosing a simple potential @xmath98 obtained as the superposition of @xmath54 gaussian functions of the form @xmath99/(2 w^2)\\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath100 this type of potential can be obtained physically by using a set of laser beams generating a set of optical dipole traps for the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we have checked that our results are essentially independent of the nonlinearity and that they remain valid for the more complicated case of a periodic potential of the required symmetry .",
    "however , the choice of the potential as given by eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) is not only simpler but allows for more freedom in the selection of the symmetry since we can take e.g. @xmath84 to obtain a discrete symmetry of fifth order , something which is not possible with lattice potentials .",
    "it is also very simple to change between configurations with different symmetry orders ( @xmath54 ) even dynamically by just adding or eliminating laser beams .",
    "in what follows we will solve eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) with @xmath98 given by eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) and initial data of ( multicharged ) vortex type .",
    "all simulations to be presented in this paper have been done using a split - step method where the spatial derivatives are computed by using a pseudoespectral formula based on trigonometric polynomials . in all cases to be presented here we have chosen @xmath101 and the simulation region @xmath102\\times [ -20,20]$ ] . in the figures the spatial region shown is @xmath103\\times [ -10,10]$ ] .",
    "the outgoing radiation is elliminated by absorbing boundary conditions such as the ones implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite .      as a first example of vorticity control by discrete symmetries we consider the evolution of an initial configuration of the form @xmath104}\\ ] ] i.e. a vortex of topological charge @xmath87 .",
    "this initial wavefunction will be subject to a potential with fourth order symmetry corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) with @xmath83 .",
    "the other potential parameters are taken to be @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    the evolution of this initial datum is shown in fig .",
    "[ sec ] . where some typical features are seen .",
    "first of all the amplitude of the wavefunction [ fig .",
    "[ sec](a , b , c , d ) ] becomes localized on the four potential wells after a transient in which some radiation is emitted . to achieve this effect of localization",
    "it is convenient to adjust the potential minima to be close to the initial maximum density so that the fraction of the initial number of particles which is retained into the system is maximized .    at the same time",
    "the phase [ fig .",
    "[ sec](e , f ) ] experiences a complicated evolution from the initial configuration with @xmath87 , to a final configuration with two nodal lines with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( which are the symmetry axes of this potential ) and constant phases across the four regions in which the space is separated by them , which correspond to a solution with @xmath8 that belongs to a representation of dimension one .",
    "let us obtain the theoretical prediction for this case .",
    "we must take @xmath109 in expression ( [ matching_condition ] ) , since the input vortex is in the first brillouin zone , and consequently , @xmath110 , in agreement with the numerical result .",
    "an interesting problem is how to process the doubly charged vortices obtained in atom chips by phase imprinting methods @xcite to obtain vortices with charge @xmath9 .    as in the previous examples",
    ", discrete symmetries can be helpful to accomplish this task .",
    "let us take now a potential with @xmath111 and a doubly charged vortex as initial datum as in eq .",
    "( [ doubly ] ) .",
    "let us choose the potential parameters as @xmath112 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the evolution of this configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ sym3 ] where the inversion of the central vortex from @xmath87 to @xmath9 is clearly seen in the phase plots [ fig .",
    "[ sym3](b , d , f , h ) ] . in this case , to obtain the theoretical prediction , we must take @xmath113 , since @xmath87 falls in the second brillouin zone for @xmath111 .",
    "consequently , according to the matching condition ( [ matching_condition ] ) , @xmath114 .",
    "it can be seen how initially a central vortex with charge @xmath9 coexists with other vortices located around it . however , as time becomes larger these vortices slowly spiral out of the system and are not visible in the region of interest for @xmath115 .",
    "the transmutation phenomenon has been studied previously in refs .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the asymmetric trap used to induce the phenomenon leads to a recurrence in which the topological charge periodically oscillates between + 1 and -1 , while in this setup we get @xmath9 for any time larger than the transient time in which the system becomes stabilized .",
    "with respect to the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite the scheme presented here has the advantage of introducing less radiation and being cleaner because of the finite range of the potential .      as a final example",
    "we show how to obtain a vortex with charge @xmath9 from a vortex with topological charge @xmath116 .",
    "to do so we must use a system with symmetry @xmath84 .",

    "again , @xmath113 since @xmath116 falls in the second brillouin zone for @xmath84 .",
    "thereby , according to ( [ matching_condition ] ) , @xmath119 , in agreement with the numerical solution .",
    "in this paper we have studied the dynamics of multiply - charged vortices under the action of potentials with discrete symmetries .",
    "we have shown how the symmetry order of the potential can be used to manipulate the topological charge of the vortex in order to obtain a desired ( lower ) value of the vorticity .",
    "specifically we have proposed a setup of gaussian traps which can be configured to have the appropriate symmetry and more flexibility than the lattice type potentials previously used .    as applications",
