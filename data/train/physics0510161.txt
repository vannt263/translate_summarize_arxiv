    "a recent experimental study @xcite of cesium atoms subjected to pairs of near @xmath0-kicks using pulsed optical potentials showed behaviour surprisingly different from the well - studied single - kick system , the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr or @xmath0-kr ) .",
    "the qkr is possibly the most studied experimental and theoretical paradigm of classical hamiltonian chaos .",
    "the classical dynamics of the system make a gradual transition to chaotic dynamics as a function of an effective kick strength @xmath3 ( related to the intensity of the optical potential ) .",
    "it has also been well - investigated experimentally , using mainly cesium atoms @xcite . in the large @xmath3 ( chaotic ) regime , typical _ classical _ trajectories are diffusive ; to lowest order , the diffusion is a random walk in momentum , with diffusion constant @xmath4 .",
    "then , for a corresponding ensemble of atoms , say , the average kinetic energy increases linearly with time i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "short - ranged correlations to the classical diffusion do exist , however , and their effects have also been observed experimentally @xcite .    in the corresponding quantum system , the quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) ,",
    "the diffusion is arrested on a timescale @xmath6 . in experiments and calculations , an initially gaussian momentum distribution @xmath7 ,",
    "is seen to evolve into an exponentially localized distribution @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "this quantum suppression of chaotic diffusion is an important quantum chaos phenomenon termed dynamical localization @xcite . a formal connection between dynamical localization and anderson localization , ( the exponential localization of electronic wavefunctions in disordered metals ) has been made @xcite .",
    "here we consider instead the case where the particles are subjected instead to _ pairs _ of closely spaced kicks : the @xmath10-kicked rotor ( @xmath10-kr ) .",
    "the recent experimental study @xcite showed that the corresponding classical diffusion is anomalous , and involves many additional corrections from weak , but long - ranged ( in time ) correlations .",
    "the experiment identified periodically spaced momentum - trapping regions where the atoms absorb little energy , interspersed by regions where they absorb energy even more rapidly than the standard @xmath0-kr system .     of each cloud of cesium atoms",
    ": i.e. each atomic cloud initially has a gaussian momentum distribution well - centred on @xmath11 .",
    "the trapping regions correspond to @xmath12 .",
    "all the data corresponds to effective values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    ", width=288 ]    in this work we extend and develop a preliminary study of this system @xcite , and reveal unusual localization properties and spectral fluctuations not seen in the standard qkr .",
    "we find a novel dynamical localization regime , with generic localization lengths @xmath15 determined by a _",
    "fractional _ exponent ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a similar exponent was found in @xmath17 , the return probabilities . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no similar study of a kam system so globally characterized by a single fractional exponent .",
    "a mixed phase - space regime ( with a mixture of a chaotic regions and stable islands ) can indeed exhibit fractional return probabilities @xcite , but it will typically have many competing exponents , characterizing only local regions of phase space .",
    "the quantum localization properties are thus not generic , and depend sensitively on the detailed phase - space structure .    for the @xmath10-kr , we present evidence indicating that the localization properties are related to the scaling properties of phase space in the vicinity of golden - ratio cantori .",
    "we argue that the observed behaviour is due to the presence of families of golden ratio cantori occupying an appreciable fraction of each cell .",
    "in addition , the ` cellular ' momentum structure suggested by the experiments is shown to correspond to a time - evolution operator with a not previously investigated _ periodically - oscillating _ banded structure .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates can be well localized within a single cell defined by this oscillating band ; or they may extend over several cells .",
    "we characterize the spectral behaviour by two parameters : a filling parameter , @xmath18 , which quantifies the fraction of a cell that a typical state occupies , and @xmath19 , which quantifies inter - cell transport .",
    "we consider two types of distinct ( but related ) delocalization transitions :",
    "( a ) a @xmath20 cell transition as eigenstates fill one cell ( @xmath21 but @xmath22 ) ( b ) a @xmath23 several cell transition , as states delocalize from a single cell to many , occurring for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as the @xmath20 cell transition occurs , all states extend into fractal cantori - filled regions bordering each cell ; we identify a regime with spectral properties ( particularly spectral variances which , while not identical , may be compared with ` critical statistics ' .",
    "the latter were first studied near the critical point of the anderson metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite .",
    "so - called ` critical statistics ' are now of much current interest in chaotic systems with classical discontinuities ( non - kam systems ) @xcite ; they have been attributed to the effect of cantori @xcite ; however they are not expected in kam system , due to their non - generic properties .",
    "below , we use the term critical statistics in this broader sense , rather than specifically the critical point of the mit .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions in momentum space effectively confines the system s eigenstates to a single cell ( with toroidal geometry ) .",
    "such a calculation shows a transition from poisson to wigner - dyson statistics ( they are of similar functional form to goe results , so are referred to as such below , although strictly they are coe statistics ) , via a new regime of intermediate statistics .",
    "we also calculate eigenstates for the open system ( non - periodic boundary conditions ) . this calculation yields agreement with the single - cell calculation up to the onset of delocalization , but beyond shows rather different behaviour . for @xmath26 the spectral statistics show a signature of the onset of delocalization of the eigenstates into multiple cells , characterized by a return towards poissonian statistics .    in summary ,",
    "our main new results are 1 ) a study of the cellular form of the unitary operator of this system , which differs substantially with the behaviour of band random matrices ( brm ) , which approximate the ordinary qkr .",
    "2 ) numerical evidence for behaviour analogous to critical statistics associated with cantori @xcite .",
    "3 ) the spectral signatures of delocalization from one cell , to several cells .",
    "4 ) a novel regime of exponential localization determined by the fractional exponent @xmath27 , which coincides closely with the dominant scaling exponent obtained in the vicinity of golden - ratio cantori . in section",
    "ii , we review the present state of knowledge of the 2@xmath0-kr . in section iii",
    "we introduce the time - evolution operator and obtain , for the first time , an analytical form for its bandwidth . in section",
    "iv we investigate the dynamical localization and the fractional exponent @xmath28 . in section",
    "v we look at the delocalization within a single cell , by solving the problem ` on a torus ' in momentum space and compare with critical statistics . in section",
    "vi we compare the behaviour with a calculation with ` open ' boundary conditions and the signature for the onset of delocalization onto many cells . finally in section vii",
    "we give our conclusions and discussion .",
    "we consider a system with a hamiltonian corresponding to a sequence of closely spaced pairs of kicks : @xmath29\\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a short time interval and @xmath3 is the kick - strength .",
    "we now use a re - scaled time in units of @xmath31 .",
    "the classical map for the 2@xmath0-kr is then a two - kick map : @xmath32    clearly , the limit @xmath33 or @xmath34 corresponds to the standard map , which describes the classical dynamics of the qkr : @xmath35    an experimental realization of this system was obtained in @xcite , with cold cesium atoms in pulsed standing waves of light . atoms with momenta @xmath36 ( relative to the optical lattice ) are confined in momentum trapping regions and absorb little energy ; conversely , atoms prepared near @xmath37 experience rapid energy growth up to localization . the experimental trapping regions are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the basic mechanism of trapping is fairly intuitive : atoms for which @xmath38 and @xmath39 experience an impulse @xmath40 followed by another one @xmath41 which in effect cancels the first . over time",
    ", however , there is a gradual de - phasing of this classical ` anti - resonant ' process . a theoretical study of the classical diffusion over longer times than a couple of kicks in @xcite found anomalous momentum diffusion for all @xmath42 , with long - ranged corrections to the @xmath43 uncorrelated diffusion rate , not present in the standard map .    below we present the corresponding quantum behaviour .",
    "the time evolution operator for this system may be written : @xmath44    in a basis of plane waves , @xmath45 has matrix elements : @xmath46 where the @xmath47 are integer bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath48 is invariant if the products @xmath49 and @xmath50 are kept constant ; while the free propagator @xmath51 simply contributes a near - random phase .",
    "provided that @xmath52 , the results are quite insensitive to the magnitude of @xmath53 .",
    "hence we often find it useful to consider the two scaled parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , rather than to vary @xmath56 and @xmath57 independently .",
    "the result in eq.([eq32 ] ) may be compared with the one - kick map in eq.[eq2 ] @xmath58 the one - kick matrix for the qkr has a well - studied band - structure : since @xmath59 for @xmath60 , we can define a bandwith for @xmath61 , namely , @xmath62 ( this is strictly a _",
    "half_-bandwidth ) which is independent of the angular momenta @xmath63 and @xmath64 . however , this is _ not _ the case for the matrix of @xmath65 .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that , assuming @xmath66 is small , we can write : @xmath67 \\right ) \\label{eq34}\\ ] ] where the phase @xmath68 + \\pi(l - m)}/2 $ ] .",
    "hence we infer a momentum dependent bandwidth , @xmath69 .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the calculated form of both matrices ( white denotes matrix elements less than a small threshold ) .",
    "while @xmath61 has a constant bandwidth , the bandwith for the matrix of @xmath65 oscillates with @xmath63 from a maximum value @xmath70 , equivalent to twice the bandwidth of @xmath61 , down to a minimum value @xmath71 .    in effect , since @xmath71 , @xmath65 is partitioned into sub - matrices of dimension @xmath72 corresponding precisely to the momentum cells of width @xmath73 observed in the experiment .    for the qkr",
    ", the localization properties of the eigenstates have been investigated extensively ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the eigenstates are exponentially localized , with momentum probability distributions @xmath74 , where the localization length @xmath75 , in the large @xmath3 , small @xmath57 limits .    for the 2@xmath0-qkr ,",
    "in the limit of small bandwidth @xmath76 we define a ` local ' localization length for the eigenstates : @xmath77    this corresponds quite well with the oscillations seen in the experiment in fig.[fig1](a ) ; the energy oscillates sinusoidally from a maximum value @xmath78 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ( in re - scaled units ) down to a minimum value @xmath12 for @xmath79 .",
    "in contrast , fig.[fig1](b ) corresponds to a regime where the eigenstates are tending to fill each cell , i.e. @xmath80 .    in @xcite it was shown that the eigenstates of the qkr can also be obtained using a @xmath61 matrix of _ finite _ dimension @xmath81 . the ratio of the localization length to @xmath81 , was used to characterize the degree of ` filling ' of the matrix @xmath61 it was shown that for a ratio @xmath82 the behaviour is poissonian . with increasing @xmath18 , a transition to goe behaviour",
    "was observed    for the 2@xmath0-qkr we can also introduce a ` filling factor ' @xmath18 defined by the ratio @xcite : @xmath83    while for the 2@xmath0-qkr we have a natural choice of @xmath81 , determined by the position of physical boundaries ( the trapping regions ) , the value of @xmath81 in the qkr case is quite arbitrary .",
    "the problem is solved ` on a torus ' in momentum .",
    "the momentum periodicity of the matrix is adjusted by a choice of a rational value of the kicking period @xmath84 ( see sec .",
    ". we can then compare matrices for both @xmath61 and @xmath65 , with similar @xmath81 and @xmath18 .",
    "the interesting aspect of the 2@xmath0-qkr system is that , as we show below , we can vary the coupling between the cells independently ( with some constraints on allowable parameters ) from the degree of filling of each individual cell .",
    "we will show below , that there is a particularly interesting regime where , for most eigenstates , @xmath85 , but the states are still largely trapped within a single cell .",
    "we can then ` open ' the boundaries of the cells and investigate the delocalization regime .    in order to investigate the transport between cells , we examine the surprisingly different ( relative to the qkr ) process of dynamical localization in the 2@xmath0-qkr .",
    ", found after dynamical localization , for quantum wavepackets of the 2@xmath0-qkr .",

    "fig.([fig3 ] ) shows typical momentum distributions obtained after a long time ( beyond the ` break - time ' @xmath97 for the onset of dynamical localization ) .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows some typical momentum distributions @xmath90 .",
    "they are modulated by an exponential envelope @xmath98 but with a regular ` staircase ' structure superposed .",
    "there is a steep drop in probability at each step : @xmath99 where @xmath100 denote the probability after and before the step respectively .",

    "it may be seen that to very good accuracy : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is some function of @xmath106 . a rough fit yields an estimate , to within @xmath107 or",
    "so : @xmath108    hence we obtain the surprising result that for the 2@xmath0-qkr , the localization length has an @xmath57 dependence with a _ fractional _",
    "power , @xmath109 . in comparison , for the qkr , @xmath110 .     plotted against @xmath111 lies close to straight lines of invariant @xmath112 , with constant slope @xmath113 .",

    "statistics are presented later , in fig.[fig13 ] , for points corresponding to the dotted line .",
    ", width=336 ]    it is interesting to consider the origin of the @xmath120 behaviour .",
    "in fact , the first @xmath121 steps of the staircase can be seen in experiments with optical lattices of @xcite .",
    "an earlier experiment @xcite with pairs of broad pulses ( as opposed to pulses short enough in duration to approximate @xmath0-kicks ) also showed a steep drop in probability over a narrow momentum region .",
    "this was identified as due to the presence of cantori .",
    "the finite pulse system does not have the momentum periodicity ( and hence the generic character ) of the @xmath10- kicked system , and is effectively integrable at large @xmath122 .",
    "nevertheless , the classical dynamics is similar to the @xmath10-qkr for @xmath123 .",
    "the qkr shows analogous behaviour : for pulses of finite duration , the classical dynamics is similar to the @xmath0-kicked system for @xmath122 small .",
    "we can examine the classical behaviour in the trapping regions .",

    "we then obtain an approximate one - kick map @xmath129    the small angle assumption @xmath130 constrains @xmath131 , the effective width of the trapping region , @xmath132     decay , before localization .",
    "the dashed straight lines indicate a slope @xmath133 .",

    "but in summary , at the centre of the trapping region , where @xmath136 , only the @xmath137 kick in eq.[eq13 ] is significant so the classical sos shows structure very similar to a ` period - doubled ' standard map with impulse @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 is an effective kick strength . however , further out within the trapping region , the sos show that it is the @xmath141 kick in eq.[eq13 ] which is dominant and the island structure is similar to that of a standard map with impulse : @xmath142    given the importance of the @xmath106 scaling seen in fig.[fig4 ] ( rather than a @xmath143 scaling ) we suggest that the @xmath144 form of eq.[eq13 ] determines the quantum behaviour .",
    "this implies that regions with : @xmath145 dominate transport",
    ". this will be the case if @xmath146 is large ; from eq.[eq14 ] , we deduce that this implies the criterion @xmath147 . however , if @xmath106 is too small , the phase space will be too regular .",
    "hence , values of @xmath148 seem indicated .    in any case , the resonance structure in much of the trapping regions is always locally similar to the standard map , but with a varying effective kick strength ( and phase of the impulse ) .",
    "for the standard map the last invariant phase - space manifolds correspond to @xmath149 or @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the golden ratio . the fractal remnant of this last manifold plays a role in transport in the standard map for @xmath152 . here",
    ", this would suggest @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the scaling properties of the phase - space around the golden ratio cantori were investigated by @xcite .",
    "a characteristic exponent @xmath155 was found in directions dominated by elliptic fixed points .",
    "we term this the stable / dominant exponent . on the other hand @xmath156",
    "was found in directions dominated by hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "we term this the unstable / sub - dominant exponent .",
    "previous studies of the qkr @xcite found a @xmath157 scaling , with @xmath158 , for momenta near the range @xmath159 . in @xcite",
    ", a @xmath160 scaling was associated to a tunneling type process ( termed ` retunneling ' ) in @xcite .",
    "an abrupt change to a regime with @xmath161 , with @xmath162 , was also observed , and was attributed to a localization process which dominates when transport through the fractal cantoral regions is more ` open ' . in that work , it was argued that the process has similarities with dynamical localization .",
    "the @xmath10-kr results , with a negative sign on the exponent @xmath1 correspond to a localization regime , and are consistent with quantum probability ` sticking ' mostly to directions where there are ( or were , at lower @xmath3 ) elliptic fixed points .",
    "one might speculate why no previous studies uncovered a regime dominated by @xmath163 ; we note that in @xcite the @xmath164 scaling refers to a local region ; these are regimes where there are many stable islands and overall diffusion in each phase - space manifold is either absent , or rather slow . here , in contrast , part of phase - space is taken by very chaotic , fast diffusing regions , with trajectories which roam freely over large areas of phase - space ; the only appreciable localization occurs at the stabler parts of cantoral remnants . in many regimes , there can be contributions from @xmath165 groups of golden - ratio cantori , rather than simply a single region near @xmath166 like the standard map .",
    "we note that fig.13 in @xcite , where the @xmath167 scaling is obtained , is in a difficult numerical regime : barring one data point , a value @xmath168 is not implausible .",
    "we also calculated return probabilities @xmath169 of the quantum wavepackets with time , averaged over 100 initial starting conditions close to the centre of the trapping region , @xmath170 where @xmath171 .",

    "the @xmath175 decay is not apparent since the wavepacket localizes almost immediately .",

    "a fit to alternative functions , such as the berry - robnik @xcite , gives a qualitatively similar picture .    .",
    "well below the delocalization border , ( @xmath239 ) all states are fully contained in their assigned cell ( barring a few edge - states at the boundary of each cell ) .",
    "but , at the ` delocalization border ' ( @xmath26 ) , a proportion of states have appreciable probability in neighbouring cells  in fact about @xmath240 of states have less than half of their probability in their assigned cell .",
    "results correspond to @xmath226,@xmath241 and @xmath242 ( upper figure ) or @xmath243 ( lower figure ) . ]    in fig.[fig8 ] , we show that the variances are close to poissonian @xmath244 for small @xmath18 , and are close to goe for large @xmath18 .",
    "however , for @xmath245 there is a regime , with nearly linear slope , @xmath246 for @xmath247 but @xmath248 .",
    "we fitted the slopes of the @xmath212 to the best straight line in the range @xmath249 .",
    "we note that the graphs are not necessarily very linear everywhere : in certain regimes there is a pronounced curvature .",
    "nevertheless , the procedure does give an indication of the average slope . while the @xmath218 results may remain linear out to @xmath250 ,",
    "the @xmath251 results saturate at much lower @xmath209 , hence the @xmath252 range is a compromise , good for all three cell sizes .    in fig.[fig9 ]",
    "we plot the slopes @xmath207 ( the level compressibilities ) , for the @xmath253kr .",
    "we see that above @xmath21 , there is , relative to the qkr , a plateau in the level compressibility , where @xmath254 .",
    "this behaviour is completely absent in the qkr : for @xmath21 , the values of @xmath207 evolve rapidly towards the goe limit .",
    "we recall the results @xcite for the level compressibilities of the anderson mit .",
    "it is predicted that asymptotically the variances have a linear form , for @xmath247 : @xmath255 where @xmath256 and @xmath257 is the spatial dimension .",
    "@xmath258 is a multifractal exponent related to the inverse participation ratio .",
    "this behaviour corresponds @xcite , in the mit , to return probabilities which decay as @xmath259 and is considered a ` fingerprint ' of critical systems , even in systems without disorder such as the non - kam billiards @xcite .",
    "here we calculate the return probabilities using the eigenstates @xmath260 and eigenvalues @xmath261 of the n - dimensional matrix .",
    "we calculate @xmath262 and average @xmath263 over different starting conditions in the trapping regions @xmath264 , exactly as in eq.[eq14a ] .",
    "we note that in eq.[eq14a ] , the @xmath169 were obtained independently of the eigenstates by direct time evolution of a wavepacket in the _ unbounded _ system .",
    "the behaviour in fig.[fig10 ] is very similar to that in fig.[fig5 ] , and again a decay rate @xmath265 is apparent .",

    "@xmath266 as @xmath232 ( the factor of 2 is attributed to weak localization @xcite ) .",
    "we also observe that for @xmath21 , in the regime with @xmath267 , wavepackets started in the trapping regions localize too rapidly to demonstrate the power - law decay .",

    ", the eigenstates are well confined within a single cell and there is no significant difference between ` open ' and ` closed ' bcs .",
    "when @xmath272 , the results are sensitive to the bcs . while the ` closed ' ( periodic )",
    "bcs results tend to goe , the ` open ' results revert towards poissonian statistics.,width=336 ]     statistics ) for open bcs can pass close to the so - called ` critical ' regime of near - linear variances , with a slope close to @xmath273 .",

    "the results are in excellent agreement before delocalization @xmath275 .",
    "after delocalization @xmath119 , the ` closed ' bcs tend to goe , the ` open ' bcs tend to poissonian behaviour , providing a clear signature of delocalization into multiple cells . ]",
    "we see here that @xmath276 would imply @xmath277 , close to the exponent we obtained previously .",
    "this indicates that here @xmath278 , the dominant exponent near the golden - ratio cantori , may play a role equivalent to the multi - fractal exponent @xmath258 in the anderson mit .",
    "this is a significant result as such behaviour has not been seen and is not expected in a kam system @xcite .",
    "unlike the billiard systems , here phase - space is not homogeneously filled with cantori .",
    "however , underlying classical trajectories may spend considerable time trapped within the fractal trapping regions which border the cell .",
    "the corresponding typical quantum states for @xmath117 also sample the cantori region , but localize inhomogeneously in the fractal regions .",
    "as @xmath18 increases , however , the distribution delocalizes into a more typically ergodic regime and the variances evolve towards the goe ( @xmath279 ) limit .     and",
    "fig.[fig13 ] .",
    "the results are insensitive to bcs before the onset of delocalization onto multiple cells @xmath275 .",
    "after delocalization @xmath119 , the ` closed ' bcs yield goe , the ` open ' bcs tend to more poissonian behaviour . ]",
    "we diagonalize the matrix of @xmath65 , with elements given by eq.[eq32 ] in a basis of a given parity , dimension @xmath280 , for various @xmath3,@xmath96 and @xmath57 and obtain all eigenvalues and eigenvectors . for our calculations",
    "the cell dimensions are in the range @xmath281 and hence each diagonalization spans @xmath282 cells ( fewer are kept since states in the cells at the edges of the matrix are discarded ) .",
    "for instance results presented below have @xmath226 and @xmath88 .",
    "hence , each cell contains @xmath283 states so each diagonalization obtains up to 7 complete cells .",
    "each full spectrum of length @xmath284 is now split into @xmath285 single cell sub - spectra .",
    "we assign the @xmath286 eigenvalue to the @xmath287th cell if @xmath288 we calculate @xmath223 and variances separately for each of these sub - spectra of length @xmath289 .",
    "we then average the statistical distributions of 10 - 40 cells to obtain smoother distributions .",
    "we diagonalize @xmath65 for basis states between @xmath290 as easily as states between @xmath291 , for example , so as large a number of sets of 7 sub - spectra may be obtained as required . for the most delocalized spectra ( with @xmath292)only",
    "a single central cell of about @xmath293 states was sufficiently well converged to be used for statistics .",
    "fig.[fig10 ] investigates how much of the momentum probability for each eigenstate is contained in the cell it was assigned to : for @xmath294 and @xmath271 the eigenstates are essentially fully contained within the cells they are assigned to .",
    "however , at the onset of delocalization , this procedure begins to fail ; the expectation value @xmath295 of an eigenstate may assign it to the @xmath287th cell ; however , most of its probability may in fact be trapped in neighbouring cells .",
    "this means that increasingly , the eigenvalues of the sub - spectra become uncorrelated and we can expect to see a return towards poissonian statistics .    the apparent ` failure ' of this procedure , in fact provides a good marker of delocalization from one - to - several cells . in contrast , the periodic boundary conditions presented in the previous section , could indicate only the degree of ` filling ' of each single cell .",
    "finally , we compare the spectral fluctuations for the two different types of boundary conditions ( periodic vs open ) in figs.[fig12]-[fig14 ] . in fig.[fig12 ] and fig.[fig13 ]",
    "we show that the spectral variances are insensitive to the boundary conditions for @xmath275 .",
    "however for @xmath119 , the variances with periodic boundary conditions gradually make a transition to goe behaviour , while the variances for the ` open ' system begin to return back to poissonian statistics .",
    "fig.[fig14 ] shows that the nns distributions closely follow the same trends .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the quantum behaviour of atoms exposed to pairs of @xmath0-kicks and shown that the cellular structure arises from a novel oscillatory band structure of the corresponding unitary matrix .",
    "one consequence is a new type of localization - delocalization transition not seen in the qkr , where states delocalize from a single cell to many , associated with a characteristic spectral signature ( the return to poissonian statistics ) .",
    "we have also found certain scalings @xmath1 and @xmath265 which we argue result from the bands of cantori present on the borders of each cell .",
    "we argue also that the @xmath27 exponent may be identified with the dominant stability exponent obtained previously near golden - ratio cantori .",
    "we show that the spectral fluctuations ( both the nns and spectral variances ) show important differences with the qkr in regimes where the delocalization of eigenstates is hindered by cantori .",
    "the numerics provides evidence for behaviour somewhat analogous to ` critical ' statistics of non - kam billiards ( in particular linear variances , with @xmath273 ) .",
    "these results are novel but important questions remain : while the @xmath1 dependence might be explained thus , it remains unclear why a similar exponent should also be found in the decay of the return probabilities @xmath265 .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath296 exponent is somehow equivalent to @xmath258 in the mit and non - kam billiards ( in other words whether @xmath278 related to any underlying multifractal character of the wavefunctions ) remains to be addressed in future .    by implication",
    ", the study shows that the behaviour of cold atoms in double - pulsed standing waves of light is quite different from the single - pulsed systems .",
    "some aspects were already identified in the experiments of @xcite and may have applications in atom optics and atom chips , possibly as a mechanism for selecting atoms according to their momentum .",
