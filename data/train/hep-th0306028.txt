    "the importance of understanding quantum field theory in de sitter space , the space - time associated with a positive cosmological constant , has been heightened by recent observations of both the early and late universe .",
    "the dramatic results of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite have provided further strong evidence that the universe underwent a rapid inflationary expansion .",
    "both the large - angle anti - correlation in the temperature - polarization cross - power spectrum and the nearly flat spectral index are consistent with the predictions of inflation .",
    "more surprisingly , the dimming of the type ia supernovae seen by the supernova search team @xcite and the supernova cosmology project @xcite , combined with other observations , is yielding a new standard picture for the contents of the universe , the largest component of which is a dark energy whose properties are consistent with a positive cosmological constant .    a striking difference between de sitter and flat space - time is the richer vacuum structure of the former . for a free scalar field in a minkowski space ,",
    "there exists an essentially unique poincar invariant vacuum state .",
    "in contrast , for a de sitter background , mottola @xcite and allen @xcite discovered an infinite family of vacua for the quantum theory of a free massive scalar field that are invariant under the isometries of de sitter space .",
    "these vacua can be parameterized by a single complex number , @xmath0 , and are usually called the @xmath0-vacua .",
    "most of these @xmath0-vacua have a host of peculiar features , such as a mixture of positive and negative frequency modes at short - distances and a non - thermal behavior that violates the principle of detailed balance .",
    "only one of these states , the euclidean or bunch - davies @xcite vacuum , behaves thermally when viewed by an unruh detector @xcite and reduces to the minkowski vacuum as we take the cosmological constant to zero .",
    "the assumption that the universe was at least approximately in the euclidean vacuum underlies the successful predictions of inflation for the calculation of the density fluctuations which produced the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation .    despite their unappealing features , the @xmath0-vacua are perfectly valid vacua for a free scalar field .",
    "if they can not be shown to be unphysical , then their existence would undercut some of the robustness of the inflationary paradigm  we would need to explain how the epoch prior to inflation managed to place the universe in the euclidean vacuum rather than one of the other infinite family of @xmath0-vacua .",
    "for example , the regularization needed by the energy - momentum tensor even for the free theory in the @xmath0-vacuum is not generally compatible with that needed after inflation @xcite .",
    "a complication in formulating quantum field theory in de sitter space is its lack of a well - defined @xmath1-matrix . in an interacting theory",
    "we have two sources of time dependence for matrix elements  one induced by any inherent time dependence of the background geometry and another introduced by the interactions . in such a system , it is therefore appropriate only to ask time dependent questions  to study how a matrix element evolves from a given initial state .",
    "schwinger @xcite and keldysh @xcite developed a formalism to solve for this finite time evolution . in their approach , we specify the state of the system at an initial time and then evolve to a finite time later . here , both the ` in ' and ` out ' states correspond to the same state and are evolved together when we evaluate the expectation value of an operator  in effect this formalism evaluates matrix elements between two ` in ' states .",
    "the schwinger - keldysh formalism is thus ideally suited for studying the behavior of the @xmath0-vacua in the presence of interactions .",
    "we place the system initially in an @xmath0-vacuum and then study whether a sensible evolution results .",
    "since the quantum field theory only is evolved over a finite interval , our results are relevant not only for the more formal question of the @xmath0-vacua in an eternal de sitter background but also for the phenomenological problem of a finite epoch of inflation .",
    "the methods established here can also be applied to any initial state , such as the ` truncated @xmath0-vacua ' of @xcite . in these vacua ,",
    "the short - distance behavior of the @xmath0-vacua is modified either in accord with some specific theory , such as the stringy uncertainty relation of @xcite , or simply by truncating the @xmath0 mode functions above some energy scale to reflect our ignorance of the new physics @xcite .",
    "we address the formal case of a pure @xmath0-vacuum and shall study the truncated case later in @xcite .    in this article , we show that an interacting scalar field theory in a general @xmath0-vacua contains linear divergences which can not be removed with a de sitter invariant renormalization prescription .",
    "these divergences appear in the one loop corrections and are present for arbitrarily weak interactions .",
    "the specific example we study is the expectation value of the number of euclidean particles in an @xmath0-vacuum .",
    "the divergences appear in the high momentum region of the loop integral .",
    "we show that they only vanish for the euclidean vacuum , which is completely renormalizable .",
    "the subject of the @xmath0-vacua for an interacting theory has also been recently investigated in related work @xcite .",
    "both of these works essentially studied the corrections to the two - point correlation function obtained between an ` in ' @xmath0 state and an ` out ' state given by the @xmath0 state at a later time .",
    "banks and mannelli @xcite found that the interacting theory in the @xmath0-vacuum required non - local counterterms while einhorn and larsen @xcite found pinched singularities in the loop corrections .",
    "these features provided highly suggestive evidence that the @xmath0-vacua are pathological in the presence of interactions . some attempts to modify the theory to avoid these problems appear in @xcite .",
