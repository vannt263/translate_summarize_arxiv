    "over the past several years it has become widely accepted that the global star formation rate  at least as seen in the optical and ultraviolet light  had a strong peak at around @xmath0  and then fell very steeply at lower redshifts ( e.g.  pozzetti , madau & dickinson 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "this would mean that most of the integrated total star formation producing optically visible light would have occurred at roughly half the present age of the universe . however , the argument for the steep fall - off at @xmath12  relies on a single important analysis by lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the canada france redshift survey ( cfrs ) sample .",
    "this sample has two weaknesses when it is used to determine the evolution of rest - frame uv light .",
    "the first of these is that it is a red ( @xmath4  band ) selected sample with @xmath2  and @xmath4  photometry , primarily , and only partial @xmath1  and @xmath13  coverage . at low redshifts",
    "this requires a very substantial extrapolation across the @xmath14  break to obtain a @xmath15rest - frame luminosity .",
    "the second weakness is that the cfrs is slightly too shallow for this problem ( @xmath16 , or @xmath17  in the kron - cousins system ) . at the highest redshifts , near @xmath18 ,",
    "the sample does not probe deep enough in the luminosity function to allow a reliable extrapolation to a total luminosity density .    in this paper",
    "we utilize a large , extremely deep , and highly complete spectroscopic redshift survey of galaxies observed in seven colors ( , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; the limits in the blue and red are @xmath8  and @xmath9 , respectively ) in the hawaii survey fields and the hubble deep field to investigate the rest - frame uv luminosity density evolution from @xmath0  to the present . with this sample",
    "we are able to avoid the above problems encountered in the cfrs study .",
    "first , the availability of both ultraviolet and blue data means that we can _ select _ objects based on their rest - frame ultraviolet magnitudes at all redshifts and hence avoid the serious problem of selecting at redder wavelengths and extrapolating to obtain the uv colors .",
    "second , the substantial additional depth of our sample allows us to probe to the flat segments of the luminosity function , thereby giving a more accurate determination of the luminosity density function .",
    "it also enables us to extend the results to redshifts beyond @xmath0 .",
    "this uniform sample selection strongly minimises possible errors due to dust in the galaxies , unless there is substantial evolution of galaxy dust properties with redshift .",
    "thus , the shape of the present uv luminosity density evolution should be an accurate representation of the shape of the star formation history to within the one residual uncertainty of differential dust evolution .",
    "we find that the @xmath12uv luminosity density falls with a shallower slope  roughly @xmath19  for @xmath20   than reported by lilly et al .",
    "our low redshift uv luminosity density value is considerably higher than that found by lilly et al .  and agrees with the local uv luminosity density recently determined by treyer et al .",
    "consquently , much of the integrated total of optically visible stars is still being assembled at the present time .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we provide a brief , self - contained analysis of the distribution of light with redshift in the hubble deep field .",
    "if this small field is representative , then the analysis can be used to demonstrate the primary conclusion of the paper , namely that the fall - off in the rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity density below @xmath0is relatively shallow .",
    "we then proceed to the main analysis .",
    "we discuss the data in  3 ; the photometry and the statistical and systematic errors are presented in an appendix for textual clarity . in ",
    "4 we construct the rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity functions and the uv luminosity density as a function of redshift .",
    "we then present comparisons with the results of other analyses . in order to be fully self - consistent ,",
    "we specifically restrict ourselves to the evolution of the ultraviolet luminosity density and do not attempt to compare with studies of emission - line evolution . in  5",
    "we briefly summarize our conclusions .",
    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .  1996 )",
    "provides our deepest view of the faint galaxy populations .",
    "the color information in the hdf has been extensively used to estimate the high-@xmath21  star formation history of optically - selected galaxies ( e.g.  madau et al.1997 ; connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; sawicki , lin & yee 1997 ) . as large numbers of spectroscopic redshifts have accumulated for hdf galaxies ( steidel et al.1996 ; cohen et al .  1996",
    "; lowenthal et al.1997 ; phillips et al .  1997 ; songaila 1997 ; barger et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is now possible to use these spectroscopic data to examine the history of star formation at @xmath12  and to show directly that , within the hdf itself , a substantial fraction of the star formation is occurring at low redshift .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by pascarelle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) based on a very different photometric redshift analysis .",
    "the sky surface brightness of the integrated galaxy light computed from the williams et al .",
    "objects in the deeper areas of the wfc chips  an area of @xmath22  is shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "there are 96 objects in this region of the hdf that now have spectroscopic identifications .",
    "these identified objects , which are generally the brighter galaxies , contain most of the optical and roughly half of the @xmath23  light .",
    "we have subdivided the contributions by redshift , showing the light from known @xmath12  galaxies as the solid boxes and that from known @xmath24  galaxies as solid diamonds .",
    "the dashed line , which shows the combined light from all known @xmath25  galaxies and _ all _ unidentified or unobserved objects , represents an extreme upper bound to the fraction of light arising from galaxies at @xmath25 .    since some ( possibly substantial ) fraction of the fainter unidentified galaxies will lie at @xmath12 , the ratio of the @xmath25  light to that at lower redshift",
    "is overestimated here but can already be used to make the argument that a large fraction of star formation is local . as was pointed out in cowie ( 1988 ) ,",
    "songaila et al .  (",
    "1990 ) , and madau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the integrated massive star formation , which can be characterized by the local metal density , is directly proportional to the observed - frame ultraviolet sky brightness , independent of cosmology , through the relation @xmath26 estimates of the normalizing factor @xmath27  can be found in songaila et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and madau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . applying this relation to the @xmath23  light in figure  [ fig:1 ] , we see immediately that comparable amounts of metals have been produced by @xmath24  galaxies and by @xmath25  galaxies , since the ultraviolet sky brightness of the known @xmath24  galaxies is already 54% of the maximum possible @xmath25  light",
    ". however , in this simple form , the argument depends onthe assumption that the light from star - forming galaxies is roughly flat in @xmath28 .",
    "a more conservative approach is to compare the known @xmath24  @xmath23  light with the possible @xmath25  @xmath29   light .",
    "this comparison at equivalent rest - frame wavelengths allows for the shapes of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and for dust extinction .",
    "it also takes into account the disappearance of very high redshift galaxies from the @xmath23  band .",
    "the ratio @xmath30  from figure  [ fig:1 ] is then 26% .",
    "this represents a very extreme lower bound on the ratio of the integrated star formation at @xmath24  to that at @xmath25 .    the implications for the evolution of the low-@xmath21  sfr [ @xmath31 can be shown with the simple model @xmath32 that can be integrated analytically .",
    "for @xmath11  @xmath3318% for @xmath34 , 30% for @xmath35  and 48% for @xmath36 .",
    "thus , even comparing the _ candidate _",
    "@xmath25  visual light with the _ known _",
    "@xmath24  ultraviolet light requires @xmath37 .",
    "provided only that the small hdf is a representative field , even the very conservative and extremely robust version of the argument requires a shallower slope than has been inferred from the cfrs data ( _ viz_. , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper verifies this conclusion using our wide - field ultraviolet and optically - selected samples .",
    "the primary data sets used in the present study are two @xmath39  areas crossing the hdf and the hawaii survey field ssa22 ( lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ) . in each case",
    "the field has been imaged in 7 colors  ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5and @xmath6  where @xmath3  and @xmath4  are kron - cousins and the @xmath6  ( @xmath41 ) filter is described in wainscoat & cowie ( in preparation ) .",
    "the images were obtained on the keck  ii telescope using lris ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) and on the university of hawaii 2.2 m and the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 m telescopes using quirc ( hodapp et al .",
    "1996 ) , orbit , and the uh8k ccd mosaic camera built by metzger , luppino , and miyazaki .",
    "the fields , whose sizes were set by the usable lris area , are fully covered in all colors .",
    "all magnitudes were measured in @xmath42  diameter apertures and corrected to total magnitudes following the procedures in cowie et al.(1994 ) . a further two similarly sized areas covering the hawaii survey fields ssa4 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 ) and ssa13 ( lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ) with @xmath43 data were used to augment the ssa22 and hdf @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6-selected samples .",
    "the fields , areas , magnitude limits , and numbers of spectroscopically - identified galaxies , stars , and unknowns ( unobserved or unidentified objects ) for each of the color - selected samples are given in table  [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "a more detailed discussion and analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic samples used in this paper can be found in barger et al .",
    "for redshifts , @xmath21 , for which the rest - frame uv wavelength , @xmath44 , maps directly to the wavelength of one of the observed color bands , the absolute rest - frame uv magnitude , @xmath45 , in the @xmath46  system ( @xmath47  corresponds to @xmath48 ) is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50  is the observed magnitude at the redshifted wavelength @xmath51  in the @xmath46  system and @xmath52  is the luminosity distance . for redshifts such that @xmath51  differs by a small amount from this central wavelength",
    ", we can apply the same formula but with the addition of a small differential @xmath53  correction @xmath54 , defined as @xmath55 where @xmath28  is the sed of the galaxy , and @xmath56  is the redshift corresponding to the center of the band .",
    "because of the frequent , regularly - spaced color sampling , we can simply construct @xmath54  by interpolation from the neighboring color bands .",
    "the value of @xmath54  is generally small ( less than 0.2  mag ) for the redshift intervals which are used .",
    "the @xmath57  rest - frame absolute magnitudes , computed in the appropriate redshift intervals from the , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath4  samples , are shown versus redshift in figure  [ fig:2 ] . in the overlapping redshift intervals the absolute magnitudes compare well .",
    "the rise in the maximum absolute uv rest - frame luminosity with redshift mapped by the upper envelope of the distribution is partly a reflection of the larger volume sampled at high redshift but also partly reflects the known evolution that causes the maximum uv luminosity to increase with redshift ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) ; we will discuss this in more detail below .",
    "we adopt the traditional @xmath58  method of felten ( 1977 ) for constructing the luminosity functions .",
    "the number density of galaxies in the redshift range [ @xmath59 with magnitude @xmath60  is given by @xmath61 where the sum is over all galaxies with magnitude @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63is the maximum total volume in all the samples where galaxies with absolute magnitude @xmath60 are observable in the appropriate apparent magnitude range and lie in the redshift range .",
    "( a very complete description of the procedure may be found in ellis et al .",
    "the ultraviolet luminosity density , @xmath64 , is then @xmath65 where the sum is over all the observed objects .",
    "we use schechter function fits with @xmath66  to extend @xmath64  from the brighter absolute magnitudes observed to @xmath67 , which we then use as our total luminosity density .    in the computation of the luminosity functions , we assign errors based on the poisson distribution corresponding to the number of galaxies contributing to the absolute magnitude bin . however , a larger potential source of error is the missing or unidentified galaxies in each sample . following the standard procedure , we compute the luminosity function after assuming that these objects follow the redshift distribution of the identified objects , but because of systematic effects",
    ", this assumption may not be valid .",
    "we have therefore also computed the lfs with all , and also with none , of the missing objects allocated into the redshift bin , which should provide extremal estimates of this error . in the case where we allocated the missing objects into the redshift bin ,",
    "the allocated redshifts were randomly distributed uniformly within the redshift interval .",
    "we are able to use this very robust procedure because of the extremely high completeness of the spectroscopic samples .",
    "a key issue is the optimum wavelength at which to compute the rest - frame lfs and the uv light densities .",
    "previous efforts , such as those by the cfrs , have computed the light densities at a relatively long wavelength of @xmath15 , which is optimal for a red sample and minimises dust extinction but may be a poorer measure of massive star formation rates than shorter wavelengths . the local uv sample of treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which provides an invaluable low redshift comparison , is at @xmath68 .",
    "however , our own sample gives the best combination of wide redshift range and largest galaxy sample at a rest wavelength around @xmath57 .    in the following discussion",
    "we shall use all three of these rest wavelengths for specific comparisons and analyses . before proceeding , however , we use the various color samples to show that at @xmath0  the luminosity functions and light densities are only weakly sensitive to the wavelength choice . at @xmath18",
    "the , @xmath1  and @xmath2  samples correspond to rest - wavelengths of @xmath69 , @xmath70  and @xmath71 . in figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we compare the luminosity functions constructed at each of these rest wavelengths in the redshift interval @xmath72 .",
    "it is apparent that the luminosity functions are quite similar , with only a slight fading of @xmath45  with decreasing wavelength .",
    "the corresponding luminosity densities for galaxies with luminosities greater than @xmath73  ( squares ) , or extrapolated to @xmath74  assuming an @xmath66  schechter function ( dashed line ) , are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the total uv luminosity density above @xmath67  in this redshift interval is fit by a power law @xmath75 where @xmath76  is the hubble constant in units of @xmath77 .",
    "we shall generally avoid comparing light densities at different wavelengths .",
    "where necessary , however , we use the weak wavelength dependence of equation  ( 7 ) , assuming , somewhat arbitrarily , that this is valid for other redshifts .",
    "we first construct the @xmath57  rest - frame luminosity function in three redshift bands : @xmath78  using the -selected sample ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) , @xmath79  using the @xmath1-selected sample ( figure  [ fig:6 ] ) , and @xmath80  using the @xmath2-selected sample ( figure  [ fig:7 ] ) . in each case",
    "the solid curve is the incompleteness - corrected luminosity function with @xmath81  poisson error bars on the symbols ; the dotted curve is the luminosity function obtained from only the observed objects ( the minimal function ) ; and the dashed curve is the luminosity function when all the unidentified objects are taken to lie within the redshift interval ( the maximal function ) .",
    "we next compute the luminosity density for galaxies more luminous than @xmath82 .",
    "this is a directly determined quantity in the lowest redshift interval , but for the higher redshift intervals it requires an extrapolation which was made with an @xmath66  schechter function fit . for @xmath79",
    "the observed light density for @xmath83  is @xmath84 , and the extrapolated light density is 21% higher . for @xmath80",
    "the observed light density for @xmath85  is @xmath86 , and the extrapolated light density is 34% higher .",
    "the incompleteness - corrected @xmath87  light density as a function of redshift is shown in figure  [ fig:8 ] as the filled squares ; the redshift range is shown as the thin horizontal lines .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors ( see appendix ) are shown as the thicker portions of the error bar .",
    "we have performed similar calculations for both the minimal and maximal functions .",
    "these represent the extremal range of the possible light density at a given redshift and are shown as the open squares joined by the vertical thin lines .",
    "the solid line shows a simple @xmath19  evolution law which would result in equal amounts of star formation per unit redshift interval and would constitute an acceptable fit to the data .",
    "the dashed line shows a redshift evolution of @xmath88  matched to the second data point ; this is clearly too steep , even allowing for the maximum incompleteness correction .",
    "the shape and normalization of the rest - frame uv luminosity function is of course a consequence of a complex mix of the evolution of the star formation rates in galaxies of various types and masses and the decrease in @xmath89with declining redshift , which most likely reflects a preferential drop in the star formation rates of the most massive galaxies ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . nevertheless , it is interesting to compare the functions to determine if there is evidence for a change of shape ( figure  [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath11  the functions can be quite well overlayed with a simple shift in the absolute magnitude ( pure luminosity evolution ) .",
    "though there is a hint that the higher redshift functions might be steeper , there is no statistically significant difference in the shapes as a function of redshift .",
    "the absolute magnitude shifts used in constructing figure  [ fig:9 ] ( + 0.65  mag at @xmath79  and + 0.75  mag at @xmath80 , both relative to @xmath90 ) can also be used to check the @xmath57  rest - frame luminosity density evolution and would imply a ratio of 1 : 1.8 : 2.0 in these redshift bins ; the best - fit power law corresponds to @xmath91 , which is quite similar to the estimates given above .",
    "the most directly comparable sample is the low - redshift , rest - frame ultraviolet ( @xmath68 ) selected sample of treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to make a direct comparison with this sample",
    "we have computed the @xmath68  luminosity functions at @xmath92  using the -selected sample and at @xmath80  using the @xmath1-selected sample .",
    "we compare these with the luminosity function determined by treyer et al .  in figures  [ fig:10 ] and [ fig:11 ] .",
    "the solid line with the symbols shows the presently - determined luminosity function .",
    "the dashed line shows the treyer et al .",
    "function for @xmath93  and converting the magnitude system used by treyer et al .",
    "to @xmath46  magnitudes with a 2.29  mag offset . here",
    "we have used a renormalization rather than a magnitude offset to overlay the functions . for @xmath92  the normalization of the treyer et al .",
    "function is multiplied by 1.7 . for @xmath80",
    "the normalization is multiplied by 2.8 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity density changes would be an increase of @xmath94 .",
    "the measured @xmath68  luminosity densities in the treyer et al",
    ".  sample are compared with the incompleteness - corrected @xmath68  luminosity densities from this work in figure  [ fig:12 ] , where once again we have shown the maximal and minimal luminosity densities with open squares . as was the case for the @xmath57  data , the combined data sets exhibit a slow evolution , as shown by the @xmath19  solid line .",
    "a steeper dependence , such as the @xmath88  evolution of the dashed line , is radically inconsistent with the data . because of the steep rise in the treyer et al .",
    "luminosity function at the faintest magnitudes , it is best fit by an @xmath95  power law rather than the @xmath96  power law ( characteristic of the optical luminosity functions ) which we have adopted in extrapolating the luminosity functions to the fainter magnitudes . in order to investigate the dependence on @xmath97  we have fitted the @xmath68luminosity functions at @xmath92  and @xmath98  with schechter functions with indices @xmath96  and @xmath99 . the fitted parameters and the luminosity densities above @xmath100  are summarized in table  [ tbl:2 ] where they are compared with the values derived by treyer et al .",
    "increasing the index from @xmath101  to @xmath102  has the effect of preferentially increasing the luminosity density at the higher redshifts where the extrapolation is larger .",
    "however , the effect is not large . using the @xmath102  derived luminosity density would increase the slope to @xmath103from @xmath104  for the @xmath96  case .",
    "we next compare the present sample with the lilly et al.(1996 ) analysis of the cfrs data at a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath15 . in order to make the most direct comparison possible",

    "redshift intervals of [ 0.2,0.5 ] , [ 0.5,0.75 ] , [ 0.75,1 ] , constructing the luminosity functions with the  sample , the @xmath1  sample , and the @xmath2sample , respectively .",
    "the luminosity densities constructed from these samples are shown in figure  [ fig:13 ] , where the filled squares are again the incompleteness - corrected luminosity density , the thicker portions of the error bars show the systematic and statistical errors , and the open squares show the minimal and maximal light densities .",

    "the lowest redshift point is already contradicted by treyer et al.s ( 1998 ) analysis , shown as the filled diamond , corrected upwards by a factor of 1.5 for the wavelength difference between @xmath68  and @xmath15 .",
    "the treyer et al .",
    "point is also comparable with the [ 0.2,0.5 ] lilly point .",
    "the present data exhibit a much shallower slope than the lilly et al .",
    "data in the @xmath105  range .",
    "this results primarily from the [ 0.75,1 ] point being about a factor of two lower than the highest redshift lilly point .",
    "the two intermediate redshift points agree well with the cfrs analysis .",
    "we also compare with the analyses of connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sawicki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , shown as open triangles and inverted open triangles , respectively , in figure  [ fig:13 ] .",
    "these two analyses are based on photometrically estimated redshifts in the small hdf proper and are in broad general agreement with each other and with the work of pascarelle et al .",
    "( we do not include a direct comparison to the latter work here as it is computed at @xmath106 . ) following the discussion in the appendix , we have made a small 20% downward correction to allow for the slightly higher counts in the relevant magnitude range in the hdf proper versus the wide surrounding field .",
    "both the [ 0.5,1 ] and [ 1.0,1.5 ] points from these analyses are higher than our incompleteness - corrected estimate but are consistent within the statistical and incompleteness errors .",
    "our best estimate value may indeed be slightly low here , since there may be preferential incompleteness in these redshift ranges . however , there is also relatively little validation of photometrically estimated redshifts in the range @xmath0  to 2 where the observed spectral range ( @xmath107to @xmath108 ) is quite featureless for blue galaxies .",
    "thus , the high redshift connolly et al .  and sawicki et al .",
    "points could be overestimated if lower redshift blue irregulars have been assigned to the wrong bin . since our maximal incompleteness - corrected estimate is not substantially different from the photometrically estimated values , the discussion of  5 does not depend on the resolution of this issue .      as has been known for several years now ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; cowie et al . 1996 )",
    "the rest - frame red luminosity has an extremely weak evolution with redshift out to @xmath0 .",
    "this slow evolution can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig:14 ] , in which we compare the rest - frame @xmath109  luminosity at @xmath90 , obtained using the @xmath4-selected sample , with that at @xmath110 , computed using the @xmath13-selected sample .",
    "the two functions can be brought into full consistency with a very small ( 0.2  mag ) pure luminosity shift corresponding to a decrease of only 20% in the red light from @xmath111  to @xmath112 , thereby confirming with the present sample that the downward evolution of the uv light density by a factor of two between @xmath0  and @xmath112  does take place against an essentially invariant shape and normalization for the red light density .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of the universal ultraviolet luminosity density from @xmath113 to the present using a magnitude - limited sample selected on the basis of rest - frame ultraviolet colors at all redshifts from an extremely deep and highly complete spectroscopic redshift survey .",
    "our uniform selection procedure avoids the serious problem of selecting the sample at redder wavelengths and then extrapolating to obtain ultraviolet colors , and it strongly minimises possible errors due to dust in the galaxies , unless there is substantial evolution of galaxy dust properties with redshift .",
    "the depth of the current sample is also sufficiently deep to probe to the flat segments of the luminosity function and to extend the results to redshifts beyond @xmath113 , thereby enabling us to make an accurate determination of the luminosity density function .",
    "we find that our incompleteness - corrected rest - frame 2500@xmath114 luminosity densities for @xmath115 as a function of redshift are well fit by an @xmath116 evolution law for @xmath11 .",

    "the decline in @xmath45 with decreasing redshift most likely reflects a preferential drop in the star formation rates of the most massive galaxies . a direct comparison of the measured low - redshift 2000@xmath114 luminosity density of treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with incompleteness - corrected 2000@xmath114 luminosity densities computed from our sample also shows that the slow evolution law of @xmath116provides a good fit .",
    "when we compare the lilly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) cfrs analysis with our sample analyzed at rest - frame 2800@xmath114 , we find that our sample gives a much shallower slope in the @xmath117 range .",
    "this most probably arises in part due to the relatively large extrapolation at low redshifts lilly et al .",
    "needed to make to go from a primarily @xmath2 and @xmath4-based data sample to ultraviolet colors .",
    "the two lowest - redshift lilly et al .",
    "points are also in disagreement with the treyer et al .  analysis .",
    "interestingly , however , the present uv luminosity density analysis leads to a closer agreement with star formation rates found in an h@xmath97 analysis of the cfrs data by tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) .",
    "we can summarise our results in the form of the widely - discussed plot of uv luminosity density versus redshift , our version of which is shown for the @xmath57  rest frame in figure  [ fig:8 ] and at @xmath68  in figure  [ fig:12 ] .",
    "this plot is rather different from the now conventional ` madau ' form which has a strong rise to @xmath0 .",
    "rather , we see a fairly slow decline in @xmath118  from @xmath119  to @xmath120 , which is reasonably well described by a simple @xmath121relation .",
    "this result has fairly profound philosophical implications in that the integrated star formation is continuing to rise smoothly at the present time and the bulk of the star formation has occurred at recent times .",
    "( this result holds irrespective of cosmological geometry . )",
    "put succinctly , as seen in the optical , now may be the epoch of galaxy formation and not @xmath0 .",
    "because much of our information on the @xmath25  rest - frame uv luminosity density is based on the small hubble deep field , it is important to check the consistency of the photometry and number counts between the present data and the hdf tables of williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    since the wide - field area around",
    "the hdf fully overlaps the hdf proper , we can compare the photometric systems directly .",
    "we first identified the corresponding objects in the two tables whose centroids lie within @xmath122  of each other and are not complex objects .",
    "we then compared our corrected aperture magnitudes with the total magnitudes in williams et al .",
    "the color equations for the four bands are found to be , @xmath123 where we have forced the color term in the @xmath1  equation to zero . allowing for the offsets in zero points between the color systems ( @xmath124 )",
    ", we can see that there is a maximum deviation of 0.15  mag in the @xmath2-band versus @xmath125 , where the color term is , however , large .",
    "we take this to be the maximum systematic uncertainty in the photometry .    using these photometric transformations we next constructed the @xmath2-band number counts ( galaxies and stars ) in the wfpc areas of the hdf itself ( @xmath126 ) and in the @xmath127  area of the hdf flanking field region .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : a1 ] .",
    "there is broad general agreement in the counts within the small number fluctuations . over the range , @xmath128 , the hdf proper",
    "has a 17% higher total flux per unit area than the large flanking field area . in figure",
    "[ fig : a2 ] we show the hdf galaxy counts in @xmath1  compared with the average @xmath1  galaxy counts in the regions of the hdf and ssa22 used in the present analysis .",
    "( only spectroscopically confirmed stars have been removed from both counts . )",
    "the total flux per unit area of objects in the hdf with @xmath129  is 13% higher than in the average of the two fields .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : a3 ] we show a comparison of the total hdf @xmath130  and @xmath131  hdf sky surface brightness in the ranges @xmath132 , @xmath133  and @xmath134  with the present samples . in the analysis the hdf lies about 25% higher in the total light in this range , with a disproportionately high amount of @xmath24  light , which is between 25% and 50% higher in the various colors .",
    "the results emphasize that clustering can cause fluctuations at this level in fields of the size of the hdf , and they emphasize the importance of using multiple large areas . in order to compare with the hdf - derived data of connolly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we have therefore revised their fluxes downward by 20% .",
    "however , the systematic error in the present much larger data sample should be considerably smaller than this and is dominated by the photometric errors .",
    "we will adopt a conservative systematic error limit of @xmath135% of the rest - frame uv luminosity densities .    in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the statistical error we divided the @xmath1  sample into two parts",
    " one comprising the hdf and ssa22 data and one comprising the ssa13 and ssa4 data  and constructed the rest - frame @xmath57  luminosity function in the @xmath136  range from each subsample .",
    "the two luminosity functions are shown in figure  [ fig : a4 ] .",
    "the luminosity densities inferred from the two functions differ by 17% . based on this comparison",
    ", we have assigned a statistical error of @xmath137 , where @xmath138  is the total number of galaxies in the sample bin , and we have added this error in quadrature to the systematic error to determine the formal error bars in the rest - frame uv luminosity density plot .",
