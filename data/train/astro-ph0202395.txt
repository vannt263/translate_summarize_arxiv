    "rv  tri ( gsc 2321.0070 ) was recognised as a variable star by w. strohmeier and the discovery was published in geyer  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where preliminary values of the light elements were given .",
    "rv  tri is classified as an algol star type , the depth of primary and secondary minima being 1.2 and 0.1 in magnitude , respectively .",
    "the times of primary minima have been frequently visually determined during last three decades , but a detailed analysis of this star is still missing . therefore , we have observed rv  tri with a new ccd camera equipment at our observatory in the summer of 1997 .",
    "the mean light curve which we obtained from the observations enables us to study this system .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained during the summer / autumn of 1997 and 1998 .",
    "we used the 0.60  m reflector of our observatory .",
    "the ccd front side camera placed at the newtonian focus took 30 or 60 seconds exposures of the variable and comparison stars .",
    "v ( johnson ) and r ( kron - cousins ) standard filters were used .",

    "( @xcite ) and values of the elements given by the last edition of the gcvs catalogue ( kholopov  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) witch ephemeris @xmath0 are highly inaccurate in comparison with the accuracy of the time of the minima determinations derived from our observations .",
    "we have observed an ( o  c ) difference of about 15 minutes at current epochs .",
    "this fact is also illustrated by the ( o  c ) diagram compiled from visual observations of the primary minima times of rv  tri ( see fig .  [ obrviz ] ) currently entered in the b.r.n.o .",
    "database ( variable star section of czech astronomical society ) .    we have tried to verify this systematic trend in the light elements of rv tri by observation of some primary minima during our observational periods .",
    "the times of the minima for each observational set were computed by the kwee and van woerden method ( @xcite ) .",
    "our and nelson s  ( @xcite ) observations ( see fig .  [ obrviz ] ) confirm this behaviour .",
    "the procession of all times of visual minima gives us improved quadratic ephemeris ( computed by the weighted robust linear least square method only for 152 accepted points ) @xmath1{r }                   24 46 033^{\\rm d}\\!\\!.30373 \\\\",

    "the use of this ephemeris out of this range is uncertain .",
    "we used this ephemeris for reduction of our observations to the mean light curve .",
    "we estimated the error of visually determined minima to be 10 minutes .",
    "we employed the observational data of rv  tri for the acquisition of orbital and physical parameters of the system .",
    "the results of 530 measurements in the r and 530 measurements in the v filter have been processed by the programs wd98 and fotel .",
    "wd98  was written by r.e.wilson and e.j.devinney described in wilson , devinney  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we uses more recent wd98 modification .",
    "an operation mode for algol type stars was run .",
    "fotel  a computer program for the determination of _",
    "phot_ometric _ el_ements  was written by p.  hadrava for data processing at the ondejov observatory ( hadrava  ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "fotel simultaneously calculates the light curve and the radial velocities with the aim to determine the parameters of the studied system .",
    "the latest version ( 1994 ) approximates the roche potential by an effective potential .",
    "the construction of a binary system model follows the paper by wilson  ( @xcite ) , but many improvements made by the author are included .",
    "the shape of the light curve of rv tri is similar to light curves of algol - like systems .",
    "therefore , we supposed that the system is semi - detached",
    ". some parameters of a semi - detached system are mutually dependent . a radius of the secondary ( filling component ) @xmath3 and the mass ratio @xmath4 satisfies an approximative condition developed by eggleton  ( @xcite ) and reduces the number of free parameters .",
    "note , the @xmath3 ( and @xmath5 , of course ) depends strongly on the shape of the light curve , but the mass ratio is poorly determined from the photometric observations .    when the system is at maximum light , the star surfaces are not obscured and the effective temperature of whole system can be estimated from the colour index ( v  r ) .",
    "the colour index of the system at light maximum ( 0.2 mag ) indicates that the system contains a star of a ( or hotter ) spectral type .    on the other hand , when the larger part of the luminous component is obscured ,",
    "the system is at minimum light and it is more red with a ( v  r ) index of 0.3  magnitude .",
    "this colour change implicates , that the secondary component is of f ( or colder ) spectral type .",
    "we have used tables by allen  ( @xcite ) to estimate the relation between the colour index and the spectral type . this raw colour index analysis and a well  known characteristic of the algol - like systems",
    "leads to the conclusion that the observed light changes consists of a semi - detached binary system , which contains a hot main - sequence primary and a cold sub - giant secondary star .",
    "the secondary star probably fills its roche lobe .",
    "we suppose in our initial computations that the mass of the secondary is only half of that of the primary and that it is highly - evolved , in spite of being less massive , according to the algol paradox .",
    "these results of the preliminary analysis of the light curve provided us with the basic parameters which then served as input data for processing with the programs wd98 or fotel .",
    "the values of the second order parameters ( limb darkening , albedo , gravity darkening ) was used from tables by claret  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the use third light leads to residues not significantly different from no - third light solution .",
    "the value of the third light parameter was comparable with its statistical and our data measure error .",
    "the resulting physical parameters are given in table  [ maintab ] .",
    "the wd calculated light curve of the system rv  tri together with the observational data in the r filter are presented in fig .",
    "[ lcrvtrir ] .",
    "the ( o  c ) residuals were also drawn ( on the top of fig .  [ lcrvtrir ] ) for better appreciation of the calculation .",
    "the light curve , the observational data and the residuals for the v filter are presented in fig .",
    "[ lcrvtriv ] .",
    "@xmath6    * not fitted , @xmath7 - orbital inclination , @xmath8 - relative luminosity , @xmath9 - limb and gravity darkening , @xmath10 - albedo , @xmath11 - effective surface temperature , @xmath12 - potentials , @xmath13 - mass ratio @xmath14 , @xmath15 - relative radii",
    "the accuracy of the gcvs light elements of the rv  tri is significantly lower than that of our minima determination .",
    "therefore , we derived improved elements using visual observations obtained during the last 30 years ( see sect  [ elements ] ) and a few of our measurements .",
    "the credibility of the visual observations is sufficient in this case , because the amplitude of the light changes is greater than one magnitude .",
    "the observed primary minima are good described by the quadratic fit of the data .",
    "its behaviour probably does not have origin in statistical errors but it is caused by period change during the latest epoch .",
    "these observations of all primary minima indicates a change of light elements , which is probably caused due to slight real changes in rv  tri orbital parameters .",
    "this hypothesis can be additionally tested by the construction of a physical model of this binary system .",
    "we have used two methods for the analysis of the observed light curve of rv  tri ( computer programs wd98 and fotel ) .",
    "the model approximation and the results of both programs are consistent within statistical errors and different processing methods .",
    "the radial velocities of the components are required for the complete analysis of this system , but they are not available for rv  tri yet",
    ".    the derived solution can include systematic errors due to the small sensitivity of the photometric data on some parameters ( especially on @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , all of the parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are strongly correlated to @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath5 and @xmath3 are bounded by eggleton s relation .",
    "this correlation and the change of @xmath13 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 produces different values of parameters as compared to the results given by brancewicz and dworak  ( @xcite ) the increase of @xmath13 induce a smaller value of @xmath15 and the decrease of the stars effective temperatures @xmath11 .",
    "the whole luminosity of the system is conserved in this way .",
    "we deduce from the best fit of the light curve that the binary system rv  tri is composed of the main - sequence primary ( @xmath20 k ) and the secondary sub - giant star ( @xmath21 k ) , i.e. of spectral classes near a0 , g5 .",
    "the stars has been approximated by tri - axial ellipsoids with the effective radii 0.33 and 0.40 of the separation of their centres .",
    "the mass ratio has been fitted to @xmath22 .",
    "we have supposed a non - eccentric orbit .",
    "the relative luminosity derived by wd98 are in good agreement with the fotel values : @xmath23 .",
    "these results partially confirm the model developed by brancewicz and dworak  ( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors introduce the following values of the parameters of this system : @xmath24 , @xmath25k , @xmath26k , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 in their paper .",
    "the disagreements are probably caused by the oversimplified method or incomplete input data .",
    "note , that their model does not satisfy eggleton s relation ( sect .  [ analysis ] ) .",
    "they supposed a detached binary system in this paper .",
    "we supposed that rv tri is a semi - detached system in our model .",
    "the sub - giant secondary star fills its roche lobe .",
    "the primary star is a main - sequence star with 65% lobe filling .",
    "rv tri is an evolved binary system after mass exchange .",
    "the highly evolved secondary star has a smaller mass than the less evolved primary star .",
    "this is contrary to star evolution theories of isolated stars , but it is in good agreement with algol paradox theories ( wilson  ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "figure  [ lcrvtriv ] shows some distortions of the observed light curve .",
    "the difference between the measured points and the model light curve does not have only statistical character , systematic trends can also be clearly seen .",
    "the v light curve shows an asymmetry , but the equivalent features are strongly suppressed in the r filter .",
    "the most striking differences are data and fit at primary minima and shortly after it .",
    "firstly , we made a hypothesis about a hot spot on the surface of the primary , which is a deformation of the light curve .",
    "the careful analysis of our whole observational equipment gave the conclusion that these asymmetries are due to some optical inhomogeneities on the surface of the v filter .",
    "this fact influences fitting of the synthetic light curve .",
    "the residuals at primary minima in the v filter presents distortions of the light curve due to the filter problem and it is possible that the temperature of the secondary contains some systematic errors .",
    "we are very much indebted to r. von unge , z.  mikulek , j.  hollan and r.  hudec for their valuable help and advice .",
    "thanks are also due to a.  paschke , m.  zejda and all the visual observers for permission to use their data from the b.r.n.o .",
    "database and p.  hadrava , r.e.wilson and e.j.devinney for the use of their software .",
    "we have done much of the computation at the super - computing centre of the masaryk university in brno .",
    "we have used the usno catalogue for astrometry and map plotting .",
