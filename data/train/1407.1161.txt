    "the investigation of heat conduction in low dimensional nonlinear lattices has attracted ever increasing attention in the statistical physics community @xcite .",
    "although early relevant work @xcite can be traced back to @xmath0 , an increased activity has spurred since the discovery of anomalous heat conduction occurring in one dimensional ( 1d ) momentum - conserving fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu)-@xmath1 lattices @xcite in 1997 . in those low dimensional study cases",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath2 of the fpu-@xmath1 lattice was found to diverge with the lattice size @xmath3 as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "this finding consequently yields a system - size dependent thermal conductivity , thus breaking fourier s law of heat conduction . similar anomalous heat conduction behavior has also been identified for other archetype 1d momentum - conserving stylized nonlinear systems , such as the 1d diatomic toda lattices @xcite , and , importantly , has been predicted to occur in momentum - conserving physical materials , such as in carbon nanotubes @xcite , silicon nanowires @xcite and in polymer chains @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the breakdown of fourier s law has presently been confirmed for 1d carbon nanotubes and boron - nitride nanotubes @xcite and in 2d suspended graphene @xcite .    on the other hand , the low ( 1d , 2d )",
    "spatial dimension alone is not the sole feature that determines whether the validity of fourier s law holds up .",
    "for example , normal heat conduction obeying fourier s law has been established beyond doubt for 1d nonlinear frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) @xcite lattices and @xmath6 lattices @xcite .",
    "for those nonlinear lattice systems the total momentum is not conserved , being due to the presence of the on - site potentials . these numerical results for 1d lattices led to a conjecture that the property of momentum - conservation in low dimensional systems might be at the origin to give rise to anomalous heat conduction for 1d and 2d nonlinear lattices , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "it then later came as a surprise that contradictory results emerged for other stylized momentum - conserved nonlinear 1d lattices , exhibiting saturated thermal conductivities such as the rotator model @xcite and a momentum - conserving variation of the ding - a - ling model @xcite .",
    "giardin and kurchan also provided a family of models with or without momentum - conservation which , however , all obey fourier s law @xcite",
    ". therefore this situation gives rise to the dilemma of what physics is at the root for the occurrence of the breakdown of the fourier behavior in 1d nonlinear lattices @xcite .",
    "most recently , relying on numerical simulations , savin and kosevich @xcite showed that thermal conduction obeys fourier s law for 1d momentum - conserving lattices with a 1d lennard - jones interaction , a morse interaction , and as well a coulomb - like interaction .",
    "those numerical findings let them to conclude ( we think erroneously , see in sect .",
    "@xmath7 below , and , as well , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that normal heat conduction emerges for momentum - conserving lattices whenever the pair interaction potentials are asymptotically free at large interaction distances .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on heat transport in 1d momentum - conserving nonlinear lattices from another aspect , namely , the _ diffusive spread _ of energy and momentum .",
    "it is acknowledged that there exists a profound connection between heat conduction and heat diffusion within the region where fourier s law is valid .",
    "for example , take the normal heat conduction in 1d cases : fourier s law states that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the local heat flux and @xmath10 is the nonequilibrium temperature gradient .",
    "if we combine this with local energy conservation ; i.e. , @xmath11 and , additionally , use the relation between the local energy density @xmath12 and the temperature @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 being the volumetric specific heat ) , then the familiar heat diffusion equation @xmath16 can be derived .",
    "the normal heat diffusivity equals @xmath17 .",
    "microscopically , normal heat diffusion can be characterized by the mean square displacement of the corresponding helfand moment @xcite , which then connects to normal heat conductivity via the green - kubo formula .",
    "the efforts trying to bridge heat conduction and diffusion beyond the normal case have only been put forward in the recent decade @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is only recently that a general and rigorous connection between heat conduction and heat diffusion has been established from first principles @xcite : it is shown that in the linear response regime , the evolution of the second order time - derivative of the mean squared deviation ( msd ) of a general energy diffusion process is determined by the equilibrium heat flux autocorrelation function of the system  the central quantity that enters the green - kubo formula for the thermal heat conductivity .",
    "the key ingredient for obtaining this msd of the energy spread relies on the energy - energy correlation function @xmath18 @xcite , as rigorously shown in recent work @xcite .",
    "this thermal equilibrium excess energy - energy correlation indeed is the fundamental quantity that determines the behavior of nonequilibrium heat diffusion , as well as the nonequilibrium heat conduction in a regime not too far displaced from thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , using the energy - energy correlation function , we can conveniently identify whether the heat diffusion in a nonlinear lattice occurs normal or anomalous .    with this present study",
    "we aim to shed more light on the conundrum that underpins anomalous heat transport in 1d nonlinear lattices .",
    "in doing so we study with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations four different nonlinear 1d momentum - conserving nonlinear lattices .",
    "the 1-st one is the 1d coupled rotator lattice which has a bounded interaction potential ; i.e. , the potential is bounded in configuration space and therefore the motion of the particles are not confined .",
    "the 2-nd test case studies an unbounded harmonic interaction potential in combination with the coupled rotator interaction potential .",
    "the 3-rd test case is the hard point gas model with alternating masses subject to infinite square well pair interactions .",
    "this model is believed to show good mixing properties and therefore fast convergence features . as yet a 4-th 1d nonlinear system we complement the rotator model with a lennard - jones 1d - interaction potential , being unbounded at short interaction distances while being free at large interaction distances .",
    "this latter model thus allows for bond dissociation at large interaction distances .",
    "for all these test beds the correlation functions for the local excess energy deviations as well as the local excess momentum are calculated via extensive equilibrium numerical md - simulations .",
    "our studies corroborate the result that normal heat diffusion is found for the coupled rotator lattice .",
    "we also demonstrate that in addition to normal heat diffusion the overall dynamics is accompanied by a normal momentum diffusion .",
    "we then elucidate that these two features imply that the system dynamics is ruled by the emergence of a finite momentum diffusivity .",
    "this observation therefore insinuates that the 1d rotator model physically mimics a fluid behavior . in clear contrast",
    ", we find that anomalous heat diffusion occurs for momentum - conserving nonlinear 1d lattices which contain an unbounded interaction potential , as it is the case also with nonlinear fpu - lattices , the hard point gas and also the lennard - jones case . the anomalous heat diffusion and corresponding anomalous heat conductivity behavior is shown to be accompanied in all those test cases with the momentum excess density to undergo anomalous superdiffusion .",
    "this latter feature causes a divergent effective viscosity , thus mimicking physically a solid - like behavior .",
    "the present study is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the state of the art of the theory for excess energy diffusion and then develop the theory describing the diffusion of excess momentum . in section 3",
    ", we put forward our hypothesis for the occurrence of normal / anomalous heat transport .",
    "this hypothesis is tested thoroughly in section 4 .",
    "we start out by performing numerical studies on an overall bounded interaction potential , namely the coupled rotator model .",
    "this is then followed by studying a variant of this rotator model by complementing it with unbounded harmonic pair interactions .",
    "in addition we discuss the cases with a hard point gas and a lennard - jones pair interaction .",
    "these detailed numerical md studies for these four nonlinear lattice systems support the fact that it is not the mere presence or absence of the symmetry of momentum conservation but rather the presence or absence of a fluid - like behavior , as characterized with normal spread of the momentum excess density , which we speculate to be at the source for the validity or the breakdown of fourier s law behavior . for the prior known cases with the dynamics subjected in addition to nonlinear on - site potentials",
    "the momentum conservation is broken : the emergence of fourier s law in this latter situation is then ruled by nonlinear scattering processes which provide a finite mean free path behavior for the heat transfer @xcite .",
    "additional conclusions and remaining open issues are presented with section 5 .",
    "let us consider systems with a momentum - conserving , homogeneous 1d nonlinear hamiltonian lattice dynamics with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "their hamiltonian can be cast in the general form @xmath19\\equiv\\sum_{i } h_i \\;,\\ ] ] where the set @xmath20 denote the momenta of particles of identical masses @xmath21 .",
    "the set @xmath22 are the displacements from the equilibrium position for the @xmath23-th atom with @xmath24 , where an odd value of @xmath3 is assumed for the sake of convenience .",
    "the part @xmath25 is the interaction potential between neighboring sites @xmath23 and @xmath26 . with @xmath27",
    "we formally denote the local energy at site @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , throughout our numerical analysis we shall make use of periodic boundary conditions ; i.e. , we set @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ". the center of mass velocity of the system is chosen at rest ; i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "note also that we use here strictly hamiltonian lattice systems which contain no stochastic interaction parts of a spatial or a temporal nature .",
    "we start out with the description of heat diffusion in a discrete 1d lattice following ref . @xcite . in doing so , we introduce the energy - energy correlation function , reading : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the ensemble average over canonical thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath13 and @xmath15 is the specific heat per particle .    given this autocorrelation function of energy fluctuations , one can evaluate the time evolution of the excess energy distribution @xmath34 starting out from an initial , near thermal equilibrium state , characterized by the initial excess energy perturbation @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the case of a localized , small initial excess energy perturbation at the central site , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "we can then use linear response theory for the excess energy distribution @xmath34 to obtain @xcite : @xmath37 this excess energy distribution remains normalized at all later times @xmath38 , being due to the conservation of energy .",
    "the commonly used quantity which quantifies the speed of _ heat diffusion _ is the msd @xmath39 of the excess energy distribution . for a discrete 1d lattice with @xmath3 sites one thus obtains with @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "this msd has been shown to obey the salient second order differential equation @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the equilibrium autocorrelation function of total heat flux defined as @xmath44 wherein @xmath45 is the local heat flux .",
    "note that this correlation @xmath43 is just what enters the green - kubo formula for thermal conductivity @xcite , being written as @xmath46 .",
    "this is so because here with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as the equilibrium average obeys @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 contains no energy current stemming from transporting charge in an electromagnetic field or an energy current stemming from a particle concentration gradient .",
    "@xmath43 is the quantity that enters the well - known green - kubo expression for the thermal conductivity @xmath2 . for normal heat flow",
    "it explicitly reads , @xmath51 .",
    "the relation in ( [ heat - theory ] ) connects heat conduction with heat diffusion in a rigorous way . as a consequence",
    ", the investigation of heat conduction can equivalently be obtained from studying heat diffusion .",
    "the most important quantity is the energy fluctuation autocorrelation function @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ e - corr ] ) ; it encodes all the necessary information about heat diffusion and heat conduction . as one can defer from eq .",
    "( [ heat - dif ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ heat - theory ] ) , the energy - energy correlation function @xmath53 determines the dynamical behavior of the msd of heat diffusion as well as the autocorrelation function of total heat flux @xmath43 .    as an example",
    "take the fpu-@xmath1 model which displays anomalous heat diffusion : there , the energy autocorrelation @xmath52 follows a levy walk distribution , being quite distinct from a normal gaussian distribution in the long time limit @xcite .",
    "this statistics then gives rise to a superdiffusive behavior for the energy spread , reading @xmath54 the corresponding , formally diverging anomalous thermal conductivity can be extracted to read @xcite @xmath55 here , @xmath56 with @xmath3 chosen sufficiently large presents the characteristic time - scale of heat diffusion .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 refers to the speed of sound for inherent renormalized phonons @xcite .",
    "the scheme for the excess energy heat diffusion can likewise be generalized for the problem of corresponding diffusion of excess momentum . for a nonlinear lattices with a hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , the translational invariance of the hamiltonian necessarily indicates that the total momentum @xmath58 is conserved ; i.e. , we have @xmath59 by observing that @xmath60 .    using an analogous reasoning",
    "as put forward with the preceding subsection for heat diffusion we can define the autocorrelation function for the excess momentum fluctuation @xcite , reading explicitly : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , observing that @xmath63 in thermal equilibrium .",
    "following the reasoning of the previous subsection we next demonstrate that this momentum - momentum autocorrelation function describes , within linear response theory , the diffusion of momentum along the lattice .    to elucidate this issue we consider alike a lattice in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath13 .",
    "we apply a small kick of short duration to the @xmath9-th particle .",
    "the kick occurs with a constant impulse @xmath64 , yielding a force kick at site @xmath9 as @xmath65 upon integrating the equation of motion from the moment immediately before the kick ( denoted as @xmath66 ) to the moment immediately after the kick ( denoted as @xmath67 ) , we find that the sole effect of this kick is to change the momentum of the @xmath9th particle by an amount @xmath64 .",
    "the momenta of all other particles , as well as the position of all particles remain unchanged .",
    "formally , this is recast as @xmath68 @xmath69    the full time evolution of the momenta and positions is not analytically accessible for non - integrable nonlinear lattice systems .",
    "however , given that @xmath64 is small , the validity regime of linear response is obeyed .",
    "the explicit response can be obtained by referring to canonical linear response theory for an isolated system @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume that the system has been prepared in the infinite past , @xmath70 , with the canonical distribution @xmath71 ; \\quad z=\\int d\\gamma \\exp[-\\beta_t h]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "with a time dependent force @xmath74 applied to the @xmath9th particle , the total hamiltonian reads @xmath75 . with the system dynamics being closed ,",
    "the evolution of the phase space distribution is governed by the liouville equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the poisson bracket .",
    "the linear response solution can be readily obtained up to the first order of @xmath78 , yielding    @xmath79    the operator @xmath80 is the liouville operator for the original , unperturbed system , i.e. @xmath81 for any quantity @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , in presence of the kick - force the thermally averaged particle momenta read for @xmath83 @xmath84 for @xmath67 , it reduces to @xmath85 due to equipartition @xmath86 , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) .",
    "the conservation of total momentum implies that , @xmath87 , is conserved as well .",
    "evaluating this sum at time @xmath88 yields @xmath89 for all later times @xmath38 .",
    "the excess momentum density function @xmath90 therefore assumes the form @xmath91 which remains normalized in the course of time @xmath83 .",
    "the density @xmath90 is , however , not necessarily semi - positive everywhere ; i.e. it again does not present a manifest probability density for all later times @xmath38 .    with time evolving , we notice that the excess momentum autocorrelation eq .",
    "( [ p - corr ] ) describes the spread of the momentum distribution after the initial kick has occurred . as can be observed below , for increasing times @xmath38 the quantity @xmath92 decreases ( at least for some finite time ) .",
    "this implies the decrease of the momentum of the @xmath9th particle .",
    "the lost momentum is transferred to its neighbors .",
    "this feature physically mimics a viscous behavior .",
    "let us next assume that the kick is applied to the center particle ; i.e. we explicitly set @xmath93 . similarly",
    "( [ heat - dif ] ) , we define the msd of the excess _ momentum _",
    "@xmath94 for a discrete lattice as @xmath95    because of the conservation of total momentum , in analogy to the energy continuity relation , we may define a `` momentum flux '' @xmath96 via the local momentum continuity relation . to see this , we write down the newtonian equation of motion for the @xmath23th particle ,",
    "reading @xmath97 by defining the momentum flux as @xmath98 , we obtain a discrete form of the momentum continuity relation , reading @xmath99 note that the momentum flux @xmath100 is actually the force exerted on particle @xmath23 from particle @xmath101 .",
    "its ensemble average @xmath102 yields the average internal pressure .",
    "following the strategy used for heat diffusion , one can derive a corresponding relation for the second time derivative @xmath94 .",
    "it reads : @xmath103 here , the centered autocorrelation function of the momentum flux is given by @xmath104    it should be observed that here the momentum flux @xmath105 , unlike for energy flux , can not be replaced with @xmath106 itself .",
    "this is so because the equilibrium average is typically non - vanishing with @xmath107 , where @xmath108 denotes a possibly non - vanishing internal equilibrium pressure in cases where the interaction potential is not symmetric .    the presence of a finite , isothermal sound speed @xmath57 may imply that the momentum spread contains a ballistic component .",
    "spreading then occurs into the positive and negative directions with velocity @xmath57 , with the two centers of equal weight @xmath109 moving at velocities @xmath110 @xcite .",

    "we find that such an infinite viscosity indicates a manifest solid - like behavior .",
    "in distinct contrast , however , a result with a finite effective viscosity indicates an effective fluid - like behavior .",
    "the general folklore in the field of anomalous heat conduction @xcite is that in momentum - conserving 1d nonlinear lattices one encounters an anomalous heat conductance behavior .",
    "the case with the rotator model , however , presents an eminent exception .",
    "so what is the physical mechanism which can explain such exceptions ? ",
    "an observation is that in all those presently known cases exhibiting anomalous 1d heat conductance the interaction potential has been of unbounded nature at large interaction distances .",
    "the known exceptions , predominantly the well studied case with the rotator model , do not possess such unbounded pair interactions at long distances .",
    "obviously the form of the overall interaction does matter for the violation of fourier s law .",
    "one may speculate that the emergence of the anomalous behavior is rooted in the form of an excess momentum density dynamics that behaves solid - like in the sense that the momentum diffusion does not support a finite effective viscosity in the spirit defined above .",
    "in contrast , a fourier - like behavior may become possible if the inherent momentum dynamics is more fluid - like , consequently possessing a finite effective momentum diffusivity .",
    "an appealing conjecture therefore is that it is the physics of momentum diffusion which rules whether heat transport occurs normal or anomalous . in short ,",
    "we next test with different models the following hypothesis : + ( i ) _ heat transport in nonlinear 1d momentum - conserving hamiltonian lattice systems occurs normal whenever the spread of the profile of the excess momentum density , upon subtracting a possibly present leading ballistic part , is normal . _ + ( ii ) _ the corollary being that heat transport occurs anomalous whenever this so adjusted , subleading momentum excess density spreads superdiffusive_. + if this hypothesis holds true it is expected to hold vice versa , i.e. , with heat / momentum substituted by momentum / energy .",

    " in this context the authors here put forward their speculative hypothesis that normal ( anomalous ) heat transport has its origin in normal ( anomalous ) momentum spread , and vice versa . having no proof available for this hypothesis we tested the claim by investigating numerically four different nonlinear model systems of momentum conserving nonlinear dynamics that are expected to belong to different classes for their energy / momentum transport characteristics .",
    "these were ( i ) the coupled rotator dynamics , ( ii ) its generalization involving the addition of unbounded harmonic interactions , ( iii ) the hard point gas and ( iv ) a case with an asymptotic free dissociation regime ( lennard - jones interaction potential ) .",
    "as a main finding from these extensive numerical simulations we can assess that our so stated hypothesis does hold up .",
    "this encouraging positive result , however , does not assure that it is fundamentally correct , as we have tested only a finite sample of nonlinear hamiltonian models .",
    "moreover , one may argue fairly that any numerical verification lacks a profound analytical foundation .",
    "particularly , the question remains whether the numerical findings still hold true in the extreme asymptotic regime of time @xmath200 , being beyond any numerical accessibility at this time .",
    "it can be convincingly stated , however , that the mere conservation of momentum in 1d hamiltonian systems does generally not imply anomalous transport .",
    "our simulations also shed new light on the question of whether the recent nfht @xcite is accurate enough to predict the scaling regimes for energy and momentum transport . as mentioned , this theory is approximative in that it is based on a expansion of the euler equations to second order only .",
    "in addition , it involves further approximations such as a decoupling of different modes at large times , which seemingly can not be convincingly justified in presence of anomalous , superdiffusive energy transport .",
    "nevertheless , this theory admittedly is the best available at present times .",
    "its scaling prediction for energy transport in models with symmetric unbounded interaction potentials yields an exponent @xmath201 ; this being quite close , but still distinctly different from our numerical value that @xmath202 .",
    "even more interesting is the prediction of nfht that momentum spread should occur normal in these cases , thus violating our stated hypothesis .",
    "our precise numerics shows however that such a normal momentum diffusion behavior does not fit with our numerical findings .",
    "this has been shown with the non - diffusive decay characteristics of the central peaks of the two opposite moving two side peaks in the excess momentum density function .",
    "this deviation is additionally substantiated with the failure of a collapse of the data for an assumed normal diffusion in the co - moving frame of sound propagation .",
    "the behavior rather fits beautifully , however , with a collapse using _ anomalous _ momentum diffusion ;  thereby corroborating our stated hypothesis . in this context",
    "we may point out that similar deviations from a normal diffusive scaling for the sound mode are present in the numerics performed by the advocates of nfht : upon inspecting fig .",
    "@xcite one detects a similar failure of a diffusive collapse .",
    "the numerically established failure here of a diffusive collapse for the case of the fully chaotic hard point gas is particularly trustworthy as we profit from underlying fast numerical converge features .",
    "an interesting question for future studies is whether the criterion can be extended to anomalous / normal heat flow occurring in two - dimensional momentum - conserving nonlinear lattice systems .",
    "typically , the anomalous heat conductance then tends to diverge in system size logarithmically @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the discussed complexity of normal versus anomalous heat and momentum transport in low dimensions might possibly be put to constructive use when designing 1d low dimensional devices for function , such as it is the case for the timely topic of `` phononics '' @xcite .",
    "the authors much appreciate those many mutually stimulating and insightful correspondences with professor herbert spohn .",
