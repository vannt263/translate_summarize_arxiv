    "now that the observation of the quark - gluon matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions is established for small baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , a challenging experimental subject following this achievement is to reveal the global structure of the qcd phase diagram on the temperature ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath0 plane . in particular , finding the qcd critical point(s ) , whose existence is predicted by various theoretical studies @xcite , is one of the most intriguing problems . since the @xmath0 of the hot medium created by heavy - ion collisions can be controlled by varying the collision energy per nucleon pair , @xmath2 , the @xmath0 dependence of the nature of qcd phase transition should be observed as the @xmath2 dependence of observables .",
    "an experimental project to explore such signals in the energy range @xmath3 , which is called the energy scan program , is now ongoing at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . experimental data which will be obtained in future experimental facilities designed for lower beam - energy collisions will also provide important information on this subject @xcite .",
    "observables which are suitable to analyze bulk properties of the matter around the phase boundary of qcd in heavy ion collisions are fluctuations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , fluctuations are measured through event - by - event analyses @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is predicted that some of them , including higher - order cumulants , are sensitive to critical behavior near the qcd critical point @xcite , and/or locations on the phase diagram , especially on which side the system is , the hadronic side or the quark - gluon side @xcite .    among the fluctuation observables ,",
    "those of conserved charges are believed to possess desirable properties to probe the phase structure in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "one of the advantages of using the conserved charges is that the characteristic times for the variation of their local densities are longer than those for non - conserved ones , because the variation of the local densities of conserved charges are achieved only through diffusion @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the former thus can better reflect fluctuations generated in earlier stages of fireballs , when the rapidity coverage is taken sufficiently large . from a theoretical point of view , an important property of the conserved charges",
    "is that one can define the operator of a conserved charge , @xmath4 , as a noether current .",
    "moreover , their higher - order cumulants , @xmath5 , are directly related to the grand canonical partition function @xmath6 as @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the hamiltonian and the chemical potential associated with @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these properties make the analysis of cumulants of conserved charges well defined and feasible in a given theoretical framework . for example",
    ", they can be measured in lattice qcd monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) also provides an intuitive interpretation for the behavior of higher - order cumulants of conserved charges .",
    "for instance , the third - order cumulant of the net baryon number , @xmath10 , satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "this formula means that @xmath12 changes its sign around the phase boundary on the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane where the baryon number susceptibility @xmath13 has a peak structure @xcite .",
    "the change of the sign of observables like this will serve as a clear experimental signal @xcite .",
    "qcd has several conserved charges , such as baryon and electric charge numbers and energy . among these conserved charges ,",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the cumulants of the baryon number have the most sensitive dependences on the phase transitions and phases of qcd . in order to see this feature ,",
    "let us compare the baryon number cumulants with the electric charge ones .",
    "first , the baryon number fluctuations show the critical fluctuations associated with the qcd critical point more clearly .",
    "although the baryon and electric charge number fluctuations diverge with the same critical exponent around the critical point , it should be remembered that this does not mean similar clarity of signals for the critical enhancement in experimental studies .",
    "fluctuations near the critical point are generally separated into singular and regular parts , and only the former diverges with the critical exponent .",
    "the singular part of the electric charge fluctuations is relatively suppressed compared to the baryon number ones , because the formers contain the isospin number fluctuations which are regular near the critical point @xcite .",
    "the additional regular contribution makes the experimental confirmation of the enhancement of the singular part difficult , and this tendency is more pronounced in higher - order cumulants @xcite . while it is known that the proton number fluctuations in the final state also reflect the critical enhancement near the critical point @xcite , as we will show later the baryon number fluctuations are superior to this observable , too , in the same sense .",
    "second , the ratios of baryon number cumulants @xcite behave more sensitively to the difference of phases , i.e. , hadrons , or quarks and gluons .",
    "this is because the ratios are dependent on the magnitude of charges carried by the quasi - particles composing the state @xcite , while the charge difference between hadrons and quarks is more prominent in the baryon number .    experimentally , however , the baryon number fluctuations are not directly observable , because chargeless baryons , such as neutrons , can not be detected by most detectors .",
    "proton number fluctuations can be measured @xcite , and recently its cumulants have been compared with theoretical predictions for baryon number cumulants .",
    "indeed , in the free hadron gas in equilibrium the baryon number cumulants are approximately twice the proton number ones , because the baryon number cumulants in free gas are simply given by the sum of those for all baryons , and the baryon number is dominated by proton and neutron numbers in the hadronic medium relevant to relativistic heavy ion collisions . in general , however , these cumulants behave differently .",
    "in fact , we will see later that the non - thermal effects which exists in baryon number cumulants are strongly suppressed in the proton number ones .    in heavy ion collisions , because of the dynamical evolution the medium at kinetic freezeout is not completely in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the original ideas to exploit fluctuation observables as probes of primordial properties of fireballs @xcite are concerned with this non - thermal effect encoded in the final state as a hysteresis of the time evolution . to observe such effects , it is highly desirable to measure baryon number cumulants that is expected to retain more effects of the phase transition and the singularity around the critical point .",
    "the experimental determination of baryon number cumulants also makes the comparison between experimental and theoretical studies more robust , since many theoretical works including lattice qcd simulations are concerned with the baryon number cumulants , not the proton number ones .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors of the present paper have argued that , whereas the baryon number cumulants are not the direct experimental observables as discussed above , they can be determined in experiments by only using the experimentally measured proton number fluctuations for @xmath14 .",
    "the key idea is that isospins of nucleons in the final state are almost completely randomized and uncorrelated , because of reactions of nucleons with thermal pions in the hadronic stage , as will be elucidated in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that , when @xmath15 nucleons exist in a phase space of the final state , the probability that @xmath16 nucleons among them are protons follows the binomial distribution .",
    "more generally , the probability distribution that @xmath16 protons , @xmath17 neutrons , @xmath18 anti - protons , and @xmath19 anti - neutrons are found in the final state in a phase space is factorized as @xmath20 where the nucleon and anti - nucleon numbers are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and @xmath23 is the binomial distribution function with probabilities @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath26 describes the distribution of nucleons and anti - nucleons and the correlation between them in the final state , which are determined by the dynamical history of fireballs .",
    "using the factorization eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , one can obtain formulas to represent the ( anti-)nucleon number cumulants by the ( anti-)proton number ones , and vice versa ; whereas the neutron number is not determined by experiments , this missing information can be reconstructed with the knowledge for the distribution function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) .",
    "the ( anti-)nucleon number in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) can further be promoted to the ( anti-)baryon number in practical analyses with a simple treatment for strange baryons to a good approximation .",
    "these formulas enable to determine the baryon number cumulants solely with the experimentally measured proton number fluctuations , and , as a result , to obtain insights into the present experimental results on the proton number cumulants .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to elaborate the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite with some extensions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the formulas are derived only for isospin symmetric medium . in the present study",
    "we extend them to incorporate cases with nonzero isospin densities . with the extended relations",
    ", it is shown that the effect of nonzero isospin density is well suppressed for @xmath14 .",
    "the procedures of the manipulations and discussions omitted in ref .",
    "@xcite are also addressed in detail .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that the factorization eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) is well applied to the nucleon and baryon distribution functions in the final state in heavy ion collisions .",

    ", we use @xmath27 to represent the number of particles @xmath28 leaving the system after each collision event , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , n , and b represent proton , neutron , nucleon , and baryon , respectively , and their anti - particles , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the net and total numbers are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we discuss the time evolution of the proton and neutron number distributions in the hadronic medium generated by relativistic heavy ion collisions , and show that the nucleon distribution in the final state in a phase space is factorized as in eq .",

    "[ sec : b : free ] , as a preliminary example we show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) is applicable to the equilibrated free hadron gas in the ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath0 relevant to relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "( [ eq : pp = pb ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_hg1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath45 where @xmath21 and @xmath46 are the nucleon and anti - nucleon numbers , respectively , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : p_hg ] ) shows that the distribution of nucleons in the free hadron gas is factorized using binomial functions as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) with @xmath49    the appearance of the binomial distribution functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_hg ] ) is understood as follows . when one finds a nucleon in the hadron gas , the probability that the nucleon is a proton is @xmath50 .",
    "the isospins of all nucleons found in the phase space , moreover , are not correlated with one another as a consequence of boltzmann statistics and the absence of interactions . once @xmath15 nucleons are found in the phase space , therefore ,",
    "the probability that @xmath16 particles are protons is a superposition of independent events with probability @xmath50 , i.e. , the binomial distribution .",
    "we note that the above discussion is not applicable when the condition @xmath38 , required for boltzmann statistics , is not satisfied .",
    "when quantum correlations of nucleons arising from fermi statistics are not negligible , the isospin of each nucleon can no longer be independent . as long as we are concerned with the range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 which can be realized by relativistic heavy ion collisions , however , the condition for the boltzmann approximation is well satisfied except in very low energy collisions @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the nucleon distribution functions in the final state in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we show that the nucleon distribution in this case is also factorized as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , by demonstrating that the isospins of all nucleons in the final state are random and uncorrelated .",
    "the key ingredient to obtain the factorization eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) in the final state in relativistic heavy ion collisions is @xmath52 reactions in the hadronic stage mediated by @xmath51 resonances having the isospin @xmath53 . as we will see later ,",

    "we shall show below that these reactions frequently take place even after chemical freezeout in the hadronic medium during the time evolution of the fireballs .",
    "the @xmath52 reactions through @xmath60 contain charge exchange reactions , which alter the isospin of the nucleon in the reaction .",

    "the isospin symmetry also tells us that the branching ratios of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) decaying into the final state having a proton and a neutron are @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) . using these ratios , one obtains the ratio of the probabilities that a proton in the hadron gas forms @xmath63 or @xmath64 with a reaction with a thermal pion , and then decays into a proton and a neutron , respectively , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as @xmath70 provided that the hadronic medium is isospin symmetric and that the three isospin states of the pion are equally distributed in the medium . because of the isospin symmetry of the strong interaction one also obtains the same conclusion for neutron reactions : @xmath71 similar results are also obtained for anti - nucleons .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : p_pn ] ) and ( [ eq : p_np ] ) show that these reactions act to randomize the isospin of nucleons during the hadronic stage .     of a rest nucleon to form @xmath63 or @xmath64 in the hadronic medium as a function of temperature @xmath1 .",

    "assuming that pions are thermally distributed , the mean time @xmath72 of a nucleon at rest in the medium to undergo a reaction eq .",

    "the medium effects on the cross section will be discussed later .",
    "substituting @xmath86 and @xmath87 , one obtains the @xmath1 dependence of the mean time @xmath72 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "the figure shows that the mean time is @xmath88fm for @xmath89 .",
    "one can confirm that the mean time hardly changes even for moving nucleons in the range of momentum @xmath90 by extending eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) to cases with nonzero nucleon momentum .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath60 resonances is @xmath91 .",
    "the mean time evaluated above is much shorter than the lifetime of the hadronic stage in relativistic heavy ion collisions . according to a dynamical model analysis for collisions at rhic ,",
    "nucleons in the hadron phase continue to interact for a couple of tens of fm on average at midrapidity @xcite . as a result , at the rhic energy",
    "each nucleon in a fireball has chances to undergo the charge exchange reactions several times in the hadronic stage .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , the above result on the time scales shows that the reactions to produce @xmath60 proceed even after chemical freezeout .",
    "these reactions do not contradict the success of the statistical model , which describes the chemical freezeout @xcite , because chemical freezeout is a concept to describe ratios of particle abundances such as @xmath92 and the above reactions do not alter the average abundances in the final state .",
    "the success of the model , on the other hand , indicates that creations and annihilations of ( anti-)nucleons hardly occur after chemical freezeout .",
    "second , we note that the dynamical model in ref .",
    "@xcite uses an equation of states having a first order phase transition in the hydrodynamic simulations for the time evolution above the critical temperature @xmath93 .",
    "recently , dynamical simulations have been carried out with more realistic equations of states obtained by lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of hadronic stage evaluated in these studies is more relevant to this argument .",
    "we , however , note that the qualitative behavior of the time evolution seems not sensitive to the difference in equations of states @xcite .    while n@xmath80 reactions frequently take place even below the chemical freezeout temperature , @xmath94 , @xmath95 annihilatios and productions almost terminate at @xmath94 .",
    "this is necessary for the success of the thermal model . for @xmath96",
    "the cross section of the @xmath95 pair annihilation is largest among all nn and n@xmath33 reactions . if nucleons and anti - nucleons are distributed without correlation , therefore , all nn and n@xmath33 reactions cease to take place at @xmath94 .",
    "this conclusion is , of course , obtained also by evaluating the mean time for each reaction using the cross sections @xcite as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) . after chemical freezeout",
    ", the only inelastic reactions nucleons go through are thus eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d+ ] ) and ( [ eq : d0 ] ) , and after each reaction the nucleon loses its initial isospin information . only after repeating the reactions eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_pn ] ) twice , the ratio becomes @xmath97 , which is almost even .",
    "if medium effects on the formations and decays of @xmath60 are negligible , therefore , irrespective of the nucleon distribution at the chemical freezeout , the isospin of nucleons at the kinetic freezeout can be regarded random and uncorrelated . on the other hand",
    ", the nucleon number distribution can have a deviation from the boltzmann distribution reflecting the dynamical history of fireballs .",
    "because of the absence of correlations between isospins of nucleons in the final state , once @xmath15 ( @xmath98 ) nucleons ( anti - nucleons ) exist in a phase space in the final state , their isospin distribution is simply given by the binomial one .",
    "this conclusion leads to the factorization eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) for proton and neutron number distribution in the final state for an arbitrary phase space .",
    "in particular , the final state proton and anti - proton number distribution is written as @xmath99 unlike in the simple example in sec .",
    "[ sec : b : free ] , the nucleon distribution function @xmath26 in this case is determined by the time evolution of fireballs and is not necessary of a thermal or separable form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_hg ] ) ; no specific form for @xmath26 is assumed here or will be assumed in the analyses in sec .",
    "[ sec : cumulant ] .",
    "what we have used here is the fact that the time scale for the exchange of isospins between nucleons and pions is sufficiently short compared to the lifetime of hadronic stage after the chemical freezeout . on the other hand , the time scale for the variation of a conserved charge in a phase space depends on the form of the phase space , and can become arbitrary long by increasing the spatial volume . when the time scale is long , the information of the physics of the early stages is encoded in @xmath26 .",
    "next , let us inspect the possibility of medium effects on the formation and decay rates of @xmath60 . in medium ,",
    "the decay rate of @xmath60 acquires the statistical factor , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the fermi distribution function and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the energies of the nucleon and pion produced by the decay , respectively . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) represents the pauli blocking effect . at the rhic energy ,",
    "since the boltzmann approximation is well applied to nucleons , the pauli blocking effect is suppressed .",
    "the bose factor @xmath104 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , on the other hand , has a non - negligible contribution since @xmath105 .",
    "as long as all @xmath106 for the three isospin states of the pion are the same , however , this factor does not alter the branching ratios eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_pn ] ) and ( [ eq : p_np ] ) , while the factor enhances the decay of @xmath60 .",
    "a possible origin for the variation of @xmath106 is the isospin density of nucleon number ; since the isospin density is locally conserved , the isospin density of pions is affected by the nucleon isospin .",
    "this effect on @xmath106 is , however , well suppressed since the density of pions is much larger than that of nucleons below @xmath94 .",
    "another possible source which gives rise to a different pion distribution is the event - by - event fluctuation of the isospin density in the phase space at the hadronization .",
    "it is , however , expected that the effect is well suppressed , again because of the large pion density .",
    "one , therefore , can conclude that the medium effect hardly changes the branching ratios eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p_pn ] ) and ( [ eq : p_np ] )",
    ". the same conclusion also applies to the formation rate of @xmath60 , since the medium effect on the probabilities of a nucleon to undergo reactions eqs .",

    "[ sec : cumulant : nid ] . even in this case , however , the only modification to the above conclusion is to replace the probabilities @xmath50 and @xmath107 with appropriate values , since the reactions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d++ ] ) - ( [ eq : d0 ] ) still act to randomize the nucleon isospins with the modified probabilities determined by the detailed balance condition .    here , we emphasize that the large pion density in the hadronic medium is responsible for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gg ] ) in the final state . in the hadronic medium ,",
    "there are so many pions which can be regarded as a heat bath when the nucleon sector is concerned , while nucleons are so dilutely distributed that they do not feel other ones existence .",

    "interactions of nucleons with other mesons , however , can also take place in the hadronic medium , while they are much less dominant .",

    "all these reactions with thermal particles , however , proceed with certain probabilities determined by the isospin su(2 ) symmetry as long as they are caused by the strong interaction .",

    "when the reactions hardly occur , the isospin correlations generated at the hadronization remain until the final state . at low beam energy , also",

    "for example , if the net baryon number fluctuations above @xmath93 survive until the final state , the net baryon number fluctuations remain small compared to the thermal ones in the hadronic medium , while baryon and anti - baryon number fluctuations separately follow the thermal one .",

    "as demonstrated above , the binomial nature of isospin distribution makes proton number cumulants close to the ones in the hrg model . in this sense , it is interesting that the experimental results for skewness and kurtosis nevertheless have small but significant deviations from the hrg predictions @xcite . the deviation , for example , in skewness , can be a consequence of @xmath219 in eq .",
