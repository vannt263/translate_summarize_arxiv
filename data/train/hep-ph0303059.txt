    "last years there was an essential progress in calculations of feynman integrals .",
    "it seems that most important results have been obtained for two - loop four - point massless feynman diagrams : in on - shall case ( see @xcite ) and for a class of off - shall legs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a review of the results can be found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , very recently results for a class of these diagrams have been obtained @xcite in the case when some propagators have a nonzero mass .    in the letter ,",
    "i review very shortly results obtained with help of two methods for calculations of feynman diagrams ( for details , see @xcite ) : the gegenbauer polynomial technique @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the differential equation method ( dem ) @xcite .",
    "the additional information about a modern progress in calculations of feynman integrals can be found , for example , also in recent articles @xcite .",
    "the gegenbauer polynomial technique has been used for evaluation of very complicated feynman diagrams ( see also @xcite ) which contribute mostly in calculations based on various type of @xmath0 expansions :    * in the calculation ( in @xcite ) of the next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections to the value of dynamical mass generation ( see @xcite ) in the framework of three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics . * in the evaluation ( in @xcite ) of the correct value of of the leading order contribution to the @xmath1-function of the @xmath2-term in chern - simons theory .",
    "the @xmath1-function is zero in the framework of usual perturbation theory but it takes nonzero values in @xmath0 expansion ( see @xcite ) . * in the evaluation ( in @xcite ) of nlo corrections to the value of gluon regge trajectory ( see discussions in @xcite and references therein ) . * in the calculation ( in @xcite ) of the next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl intercept of spin - dependent part of high - energy asymptotics of hadron - hadron cross - sections . * in the calculation ( in @xcite ) of the next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl equation at arbitrary conformal spin .",
    "* in the evaluation ( in @xcite ) of the most complicated parts of @xmath3 contributions to critical exponents of @xmath4-theory , for any spacetime dimensionality @xmath5 .",
    "* the articles @xcite and @xcite : + * a ) * the set of two - point two - loop feynman diagrams with one- and two - mass thresholds has been evaluated by dem ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the results are presented in ref @xcite and in the review @xcite .",
    "some of them have been known before ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the check of the results has been done by veretin programs ( see discussions in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ -0.3 cm -0.7 cm + * b ) * the set of three - point two - loop feynman integrals with one- and two - mass thresholds has been evaluated ( the results of some of them has been known before ( see @xcite ) ) by a combination of dem and veretin programs for calculation of first terms in small - moment expansion of feynman diagrams ( see discussions in @xcite and references therein ) . * the article @xcite : the full set of two - point two - loop on - shell master diagrams has been evaluated by dem .",
    "the check of the results has been done by kalmykov programs ( see discussions in @xcite and references therein ) . * the article @xcite : the set of three - point and four - point two - loop massless feynman diagrams has been evaluated .",
