    "the local stellar uv , presumed largely absorbed within the  regions by our model ( section [ sec : radi - trans ] ) , has an effect on grb - dlas but appears unimportant in understanding the qso - dlas .",
    "however the incoming background intergalactic mean field has an impact on both classes of object ( section [ sec : radi - trans ] ) .",
    "typical temperatures and densities for the regions of interest are indicated ( based on observations of our own galaxy).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    observations of transient gamma ray burst ( grb ) afterglows have recently been established as a promising new window on the high redshift universe . in particular",
    "the coupling of rapid response observing opportunities on large telescope facilities with the detection alerts provided by the swift satellite @xcite have produced a modest but growing sample of high quality data .",
    "the grbs are assumed ( in the case of long duration grbs which have brighter optical afterglows and will be the focus of the present work ) to be associated with the death of wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "intrinsic absorption features in the grb afterglow spectra are of particular interest because they probe the gaseous environment of the progenitor .",
    "the physical state of the gas may be quite different from that of typical ( cross - section weighted ) intervening absorbers .",
    "dense neutral hydrogen giving rise to intervening absorption with column densities @xmath13 exceeding @xmath14 is known as a damped lyman alpha system ( dla ) ; the  absorption and its associated metal line features are commonly studied in the spectra of quasars .",
    "the focus of the present paper will be the analogue of dlas seen in the intrinsic spectra of grb afterglows : neutral hydrogen absorption at the emission redshift of the grb itself , by analogy termed a `` grb - dla '' would not exceed the traditional dla threshold . ] . because grb - dlas are physically associated with the grb hosts",
    ", their nature may be quite different from intervening dlas studied in quasar spectra ( qso - dlas ) ; part of the aim of this paper is to recap known observational differences and link them to the underlying protogalactic populations .",
    "indeed , a statistical comparison of qso - dlas with grb - dlas immediately confirms that the populations are distinct .",
    "while the frequency of quasar absorption systems decays monotonically with increasing neutral hydrogen column density , the observed frequency of grb - dlas grows to a peak at @xmath15 ( a column density exceeding the strongest qso - dla ever observed ; 2006 ) .",
    "metallicities of the -associated gas , although challenging to measure in the transient grb - dla afterglows , are generally in the range @xmath16 , with a median somewhat exceeding @xmath17 ; whereas the median qso - dla metallicity is around @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of the grb - dla population is maturing , but is not firmly established .",
    "it seems clear that , qualitatively , an association of grb events with the death of massive , short - lived stars leads to the correct expectation of higher column densities ( to ensure high star formation rates ) and higher metallicities .",
    "this has led to the schematic picture ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that grb - dlas preferentially probe the innermost regions of rapidly star forming protogalactic halos ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) , while qso - dlas intersect the outer regions of such systems . the neutral gas probed by the grb - dlas is not thought to be in the immediate circumstellar environment but rather at distances exceeding at least 10 parsecs",
    "this follows because , under realistic assumptions , the uv emission from the afterglow itself is capable of ionising any local neutral material within just an hour of the photons from the initial burst arriving @xcite .",
    "the non - local picture is reaffirmed by the non - detection of time variations in the neutral columns @xcite .",
    "in addition , approximate upper limits on distances of absorbing gas can be derived from uv pumping of fine - structure transitions , which suggest the responsible neutral gas is at a distance of at least @xmath19 @xcite and perhaps as much as @xmath20 .",
    "finally , dust depletion patterns seem more consistent with those seen in the warm neutral ism of our galaxy , rather than in cold dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is possible that , in addition to the grb - dlas probing particular regions of halos , the population of objects giving rise to grb - dlas are on average more massive than those giving rise to qso - dlas . this will arise if the cold gas cross - section ( relevant for qso - dlas ) has a shallower than linear relationship with the uv luminosity ( assumed relevant for grb - dlas ) ; such a picture has been successfully employed by @xcite to reproduce differences in metallicities of the absorber populations .    as well as providing insights into individual objects ,",
    "grb - dlas offer an unusually direct way to probe the escape of ionizing photons from the star forming regions with which they are associated . on the assumption that the grb rate traces the star formation accurately",
    ", one may construct a global escape fraction @xmath21 by modest extrapolation from the grb - dla column density distribution @xcite .",
    "conversely recent simulations by @xcite , aimed at constraining escape fraction statistics , have incidentally been able to account for the grb - dla distribution ( albeit with some mismatch at high column densities ) .",
    "the emphasis in our work is reversed : we focus on statistics of grb - dlas between @xmath22 , @xmath23 of which have column densities exceeding @xmath24 .",
    "we use high resolution hydrodynamical simulations with physically motivated star formation feedback algorithms @xcite to generate a catalogue of grb - dla sightlines .",
    "this catalogue can be compared to current observational constraints , while the association of each simulated sightline with a specific protogalactic object allows us to predict the relationship between grb - dlas and other known classes of objects ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we can regard such associations with some confidence since , after calibrating two free parameters in isolated disk galaxy tests , the simulations are known to reproduce realistic @xmath25 disk galaxies @xcite , have realistic stellar mass - metallicity relations at low and high redshifts ( @xcite 2007 ; see also section 7.5 of 2008 ) , and have produced a population of qso - dlas which are as realistic as current techniques permit ( for a detailed comparison to observations see * ? ? ?",

    "as a result , the statistics of systems with @xmath26 seem to be sensitive to assumptions in our approximations , and corresponding caution will be exercised in our interpretation  but results appear robust for larger column densities .",

    "we produce a set of simulated grb - dla statistics which we compare , where possible , with existing observations ( section [ sec : results ] ) . while both observational statistics and theoretical models are far less certain for grb - dlas than qso - dlas , we are able to draw tentative conclusions from our present study in section [ sec : conc - dis ] .",

    ", one must be as careful as possible to test whether the arbitrary choice of region may have affected results through environmental dependences ; we take agreement of statistics between boxes ( where their resolved halo mass ranges overlap ) as evidence that no severe problems are to be expected . in particular",

    "there is no evidence for meaningful disagreement between the properties of halos within these boxes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , as in p08 , we must accept in principle the possibility that we miss an environmental effect which has an impact on statistics  this is to be regarded as a trade - off against resolving such a large range of halo masses with relatively uniform resolution .    while the regions are from a different realization of the initial power spectrum than those presented in p08 ,",
    "the physics remains almost identical except for two notable differences .",
    "firstly we have used the self - shielding approximation , described in section 5.4 of p08 , in all our simulations .",
    "this has the effect of slightly raising cold gas fractions and lowering dwarf galaxy metallicities ( the latter because the lower pressure of the ambient ism makes our feedback algorithm somewhat more effective ) ; see p08 for details .",
    "secondly , we have implemented a turbulent metal diffusion algorithm as described at the start of this section .",
    "because of the long lead - time involved in running the simulations considered , the cosmological parameters employed ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) are close to , but not fully , consistent with the latest constraints from large scale observational results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we post - process the output with a simple equilibrium radiative transfer algorithm , described in section 3.1 of p08 , to improve our estimate of the self - shielding effect .",
    "we previously argued that the correction to this picture from local sources , which were not included , would be small .",
    "however , in grb - dlas , where the sightline necessarily passes through highly ionized bubbles around hot stars , local radiation sources are likely to have a stronger impact on results ( these hot bubbles presumably having negligible cross - section to a qso sightline ) .",
    "observationally , fine - structure transitions in grb - dla absorbers indeed suggest the presence of a local uv field @xcite .",
    "a study of the local ism shows that incorporating the stellar ionizing sources into a radiative transfer scheme using the raw density field from the simulations will overestimate the effect of local sources .",
    "this is because young stars are initially surrounded by a dense molecular cloud , which is rapidly photoevaporated to form an  region .",
    "such regions have high densities , typically between @xmath46 and @xmath47 but sometimes as high as @xmath48 .",
    "hence their recombination time is short and they are able to absorb the vast majority of the uv radiation produced within them .",

    "we verified that the impact on the quasar dla statistics is , as expected , insignificant , but the effect on grb - dlas is non - negligible ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our approach ignores the effect of dust which is capable of absorbing a significant fraction of ionizing radiation @xcite ; since the quantity of dust in high redshift  regions is hard to assess , we merely admit that the magnitude of our correction could be reduced by including dust ( see also section [ sec : conc - dis ] ) .",
    "we further fail to account for molecular clouds , which could be important in understanding dlas and grb - dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "also suggested that non - detections in most grb spectra are expected given the low metallicities of typical systems observed with high resolution spectroscopy .",

    "we choose the star particles younger than @xmath58 in each halo as launch sites for our tracer sightlines in order to reflect this assumed association .",
    "clearly the maximum age exceeds by an order of magnitude the actual lifetime of the grb progenitors , but it is required to guarantee at least @xmath59 candidate launch sites in each star forming halo ( in turn required for reliability of our resampling mechanism described in section [ sec : resampling ] ) .",
    "we verified that reducing cut - off times to @xmath60 ( the minimum possible at our resolutions ) did not significantly affect our results with the exception of the low column density distribution ( @xmath61 )  see section  [ sec : column - dens - distr ] .",
    "additionally , we considered the effect of a metallicity ceiling for progenitor stars ; such a limit is motivated by grb collapsar models which require mass loss over the progenitor wolf rayet stellar lifetime to be small @xcite .",
    "however , we found its effect  even on the measured column metallicities  to be minor .",
    "a discussion is given in section  [ sec : metal - ceiling ] .",
    "the sightline properties are generated using the code described in p08 , performing a full sph line - of - sight integration to determine the column densities of neutral hydrogen and neutral - phase metals , i.e. the sightline metallicity is defined to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the distance from the grb along the line of sight and @xmath64 is the metal mass fraction at that point .",

    "we use the oxygen mass abundance reported by the simulations as our metallicity tracer , using the reference value @xmath66 ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to normalize to a solar metallicity scale .",
    "the choice of oxygen reflects its status as the most abundant metal by mass ; differences between elements are small relative to the overall spread of metallicities under consideration .",
    "the set of halos extracted from all boxes is used to generate a cosmological sample in a directly analogous fashion to that described by p08 .",
    "however , instead of using a gaseous cross - section we arrange that the probability of selecting a sightline from a particular halo of virial mass @xmath67 is proportional to the product of the halo mass function @xmath68 and the star formation rate of that halo @xmath69 .",
    "we bin our ensemble of halos in virial mass ; the probability of a given grb originating in the halo @xmath70 from mass bin @xmath71 is then proportional to @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the halo mass function integrated over the mass range of bin @xmath75 ( p08 equation 4 ) and @xmath76 is the total number of halos from our simulations in that bin .",

    "the grb rate contribution begins to be suppressed by the downturn in the cosmological halo mass function ; however , somewhat unsatisfactorily , our most massive halo has @xmath82 which means that the volume of our simulations is insufficient to trace objects until they are so rare as to be cosmologically insignificant .",
    "we checked for systematic effects by artificially cutting off our distribution at @xmath83 , finding that no results were severely effected , but a satisfactory resolution would require considerably larger simulations to produce a full population of rare @xmath84 objects .",

    "in particular , it falls short of the @xmath113 derived by @xcite from reasonable extrapolation of the observed grb - dla statistics ( see also * ? ? ? * ) ; this is a reflection of our previously described underestimate of the abundance of absorbers in the observational bin @xmath114 .",
    "more worryingly , our derived fraction is very sensitive to assumptions we make about launching the grb sightlines ; for instance , adding a @xmath115 gaussian random offset to our stellar particle loci raises the fraction to @xmath116 . such an approach might be justifiable if runaway massive stars are preferentially involved in grb events .    while some adjustments can increase the reported escape fraction , others cause it to decrease .",
    "for instance when we restricted sightlines to originate from younger stellar populations ( @xmath117 ) than our fiducial technique imposes ( section [ sec : sightline - generation ] ) we derived an escape fraction of @xmath118 .",
    "we also implemented a model in which the grb launch rate is made proportional to the instantaneous star formation rate as determined by the gas properties ( i.e. taking @xmath119 in regions where star formation is permitted , as opposed to probing new star particles formed by the simulation , section [ sec : sightline - generation ] ) . in this case",
    "the escape fraction dropped to just @xmath120 .",
    "these changes appear to be because our stellar feedback algorithm rapidly decreases the density in regions around young stars in the live simulation , an effect underestimated in the fully instantaneous model  but perhaps overestimated in our standard approach which allows for excessive delays between formation and grb events .",
    "none of our other results  including the column density distribution for @xmath6  are strongly affected by these changes , so while the escape fraction seems to highlight shortcomings in our approximate schemes , we are confident that the majority of our results are robust . further discussion of this point is offered in section [ sec : conc - dis ] .      as described above ,",
    "both observed and simulated grb - dlas have an entirely different @xmath13-distribution from that of qso - dlas . to account for this",
    "we should consider the relative importance of the two major distinctions between these populations ( halo mass weighting and internal sightline positioning ; section [ sec : origins - grb - dlas ] ) .",
    "we find that the difference in the column density distributions arises chiefly from the grb s propensity to probe inner regions of the halo , rather than any difference in the column density distribution as a function of halo mass .",
    "we verified this by ( unphysically ) weighting our qso - dla sightlines using the grb - dla halo weights ( @xmath72 ; equation [ eq : weight ] )  the result was an increase in the median @xmath13 of just @xmath121 , from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "conversely , by weighting our grb - dla sightlines using the qso - dla halo weights ( based on the  cross - section ) we found that the median grb - dla column density decreased by just @xmath121 .",
    "this result was foreshadowed by figure 8 of p08 which shows that the mass of the hosting halo has relatively little effect on the @xmath13 value of a typical sightline .",
    "the combination of an observationally - derived fit to the qso - dla column density distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the schmidt - kennicutt relation between gas surface density and star formation rate ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ; @xcite @xcite ) actually predicts a grb - dla column density distribution .",
    "this prediction is independent of the details of the underlying halo populations , relying only on the qso absorbers to trace the unbiased neutral hydrogen distribution .",
    "if the column density distribution follows a schechter function @xcite with asymptotic slope @xmath100 and exponential scale @xmath126 one has the following result for the distribution of grb @xmath13 values : @xmath127 where the @xmath128 in the exponent arises from the change of variables @xmath129 and the @xmath130 in the exponential arises because , by symmetry , a sightline to the grb intersects on average half of the total gas column density of the host galaxy .",
    "we exhibit this function as a dashed line in figure [ fig : colden ] , using the peak posterior dust - corrected parameters @xcite determined for the previously mentioned sdss dr5 sample in the redshift interval @xmath131 : @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "qualitatively , this approach predicts the correct form for the grb - dla @xmath13 distribution , with a peak and long tail to low column densities .",
    "however , quantitative details at high @xmath13 are in some tension with the observed grb - dla results .",
    "( one is less interested in pursuing exact agreement below @xmath134 since such systems are not included in the fit to the quasar data . )",
    "p08 showed that our simulated qso - dla column density distribution , while in good overall agreement with the observed distribution , over - predicts the occurrence of high @xmath13 quasar systems . yet",
    "the present considerations show that the _ observed _ qso - dla distribution _ under_-predicts the occurrence of high @xmath13 grb systems  while the simulations are in better agreement with observations ! this three - way tension between the observed qso - dlas , observed grb - dlas and simulations may be a fruitful line of future exploration to understand details of the high redshift ism .",
    "for instance , high-@xmath13 quasar absorbers are plausibly limited by h@xmath55 formation @xcite .",
    "the relative over - abundance of high-@xmath13 absorbers in grb afterglows might then suggest dissociation of molecular clouds in the vicinity of uv - bright young stellar populations responsible for the grb events . given the crudeness of our gas phase modelling , we are not in a position to make any certain conclusions at this stage .",
    "we should take a moment to consider whether it is appropriate to apply the kennicutt relation in the sense above . in a direct test of the the relation s applicability to quasar dla populations",
    ", @xcite used the @xmath13 distribution to predict a background level of faint diffuse emission at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath135 .",
    "after blind searches in deep imaging , they concluded that the kennicutt relation was over - estimating star formation in dlas .",
    "however the authors also noted that this result may be negated if a substantial fraction of dlas are associated with nearby bright compact sources , which were excluded from their search algorithms . since this association indeed appears to hold in our simulations ( p08 ) , the relation may tentatively be applied .",
    "we note that the naive kennicutt weighting applied to the simulated qso - dlas does produce the approximate distribution of simulated grb - dlas , so this method can not constitute an entirely spurious comparison . @xcite",

    "our metallicity distribution peaks at around @xmath137 , with a sharp decline to higher metallicities ( and long tail to lower ) ; as a result the median is approximately @xmath138 .    as a rough observational comparison , we used the lists of @xcite and @xcite to compile eight grb - dla metallicity measurements and a further seven lower limits at @xmath0 ; to our knowledge this is a complete census of such constraints .",
    "the small numbers , line saturation effects and unknown biases make it hard , at present , to attempt a quantitative comparison of the observed and simulated metallicity distributions .",

    ". mean neutral gas metallicity in our halos range from @xmath141 for @xmath142 to @xmath143 for @xmath144 : a @xmath145 rise is expected from this effect .",
    "the remainder of the effect is accounted for by the marginally higher metallicities of the central regions which the grb sightlines probe .",

    "little of the gas by volume exceeds @xmath150 solar ( red region , the cut - off in our truncated grb model ) , and star formation in nearby regions can still give rise to grbs with lines - of - sight intersecting the high @xmath151 region.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    so far we have assumed that grb events simply trace , in an unbiased fashion , star formation activity in the cosmos .",
    "however , grbs are thought to arise from rapidly rotating progenitor stars .",
    "since angular momentum is concentrated in outer layers of high mass stars , it is easily lost through winds .",
    "mass loss rates are thought to scale almost linearly with metallicity , so grbs could well arise preferentially from low metallicity progenitor stellar populations .",
    "there is also some observational evidence , particularly at low redshifts , that grb - hosting populations are indeed biased in this sense ( e.g. @xcite 2006 , @xcite 2008 , @xcite 2009 ; although see @xcite 2007 , @xcite 2008 , @xcite 2009 ) .",
    "we tested the effect of such a picture on our results by producing a new set of sightlines , allowing grbs to be launched only from stellar populations with @xmath136 ( as suggested by * ? ? ? * ) and",
    "re - calculating the halo weights according to @xmath152 where @xmath72 is defined by ( [ eq : weight ] ) and @xmath153 is the mass fraction of young stars ( according to our criterion in section [ sec : sightline - generation ] ) with metallicity below the adopted limit .",
    "we found that the differences in column density and impact parameter distributions are entirely negligible ; the only significant effect was seen in the sightline neutral gas metallicities and the stellar population metallicities ( the latter quantity is discussed below in section [ sec : grb - host - halo ] ) .",
    "the updated neutral gas metallicity distribution is shown as a dotted line in figure [ fig : metal ] and shows a reduction in median metallicity by @xmath154 to @xmath155=-0.9 $ ] .",
    "this is a relatively small shift , largely reflecting that even our most massive halos at @xmath33 have mean cold gas metallicities of only @xmath156 .",
    "furthermore sightlines of up to solar metallicity remain attainable with the cut because the neutral gas within each halo has metallicity dispersions of up to an order of magnitude ; thus sightlines which start in a low metallicity environment may nonetheless encounter a nearby dense knot of solar metallicity gas which dominates the line - of - sight measurement .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ fig : metalmap ] , which shows the metallicity of the gas in a thin slice through the centre of the largest halo in the mg box .",
    "red and white regions have metallicity such that they are excluded from hosting grb progenitors .",
    "overplotted contours show the regions in which the neutral gas volume density exceeds @xmath157 ,",

    "dense neutral regions ( @xmath160 ) have mean metallicity @xmath161 with a dispersion of @xmath162 .",
    "qualitatively grbs are to be found in the densest regions which are not forbidden by the metallicity cut ( i.e. not within the red area ) ; the prime location remains very close to the centre so that high metallicity gas will present a large cross - section to the sightline .",
    "grb ( thick solid line , dotted line for @xmath163 progenitors ) and qso - dlas ( dashed line ) . from top to bottom we plot the probability densities distributions for star formation rate , total stellar mass and ( mass - weighted ) stellar population metallicity respectively . a second scale on the uppermost panel converts the star formation rate to an ultraviolet ab magnitude as described in the text , ignoring dust obscuration .",
    "the properties of the host galaxies of the two classes of absorber differ in accordance with their different virial masses , with the grbs favouring somewhat higher star formation rates , total stellar masses and stellar metallicities .",
    "this applies even for the cut metallicity grb population , although the high-@xmath151 peak is slightly suppressed in this case.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our simulation naturally associates each qso- or grb- sightline with a host halo , the properties of which can readily be computed . in this section",

    "the dotted lines show the population of grb - dlas if a progenitor metallicity criterion @xmath136 is introduced ( see section [ sec : metal - ceiling ] ) .",
    "the grb - dla hosts generally show somewhat higher star formation rates , total stellar masses and metallicities than the intervening population : mean star formation rates is equivalent to figure 14 of p08 ; however the latter plot shows @xmath164 , not @xmath165 as its label in the published version erroneously claims  this was a typographical error . ] for the grb and qso dlas are @xmath166 and @xmath167 , a difference of @xmath168 .",
    "however this should be compared with a wide dispersion of around @xmath169 in both cases .",
    "we have added to the top panel a scale showing corresponding unobscured uv magnitudes using the luminosity conversion ratio from , corrected by a factor @xmath170 in order to consistently use the kroupa imf assumed by our simulations",
    ".    mean stellar masses for the qso - dla and grb - dla host populations differ by around an order of magnitude ( with respective values @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) , but exhibit wide dispersions around these values . for the stellar metallicity ( distinct from the neutral gas metallicities described in section [ sec : metall - distr ] ) the mean values are @xmath173 , @xmath174 for unbiased and metallicity - biased grbs respectively compared against @xmath175 for the qso dlas .",
    "the agreement of these results with observational constraints have been discussed elsewhere for qsos ( p08 ) . for grbs ,",
    "no homogeneous high redshift catalogues of host galaxies have been assembled .",
    "however the four @xmath176 objects studied by have star formation rates well within the range suggested by our simulations ; see also @xcite . at @xmath0 , the eight grb - dlas with identified host galaxies listed by @xcite",
    "have a range of luminosities @xmath177 in the observer - frame v band ; broadly , given that our brightest objects should be substantially dust obscured in the rest - frame uv , our results are consistent with these observations .",
    "all of the distributions can be interpreted by inspecting the relation between virial mass and the property under consideration ( see , for example , figure 13 of p08 for the star formation rate ) . as well as",
    "satisfactorily accounting for the approximate means in each case , specific features in the distribution function can be explained in this way .",
    "in particular @xmath178 rises steeply from @xmath179 at @xmath180 to around half solar at @xmath181 , beyond which the metallicity remains constant .",
    "physically this is because massive halos harbour older stellar populations as well as the young enriched stars from recent formation activity .",
    "this gives rise to bimodality in the metallicity of the qso - dla stellar populations , with peaks at @xmath182 ( corresponding to the metallicity of the peak qso - dla mass , @xmath183 ) and @xmath184 ( corresponding to the plateau metallicity : all halos with @xmath185 fall into this bin ) .",
    "bimodality is not seen in the neutral gas metallicities because these measurements are averaged only along the line of sight , not the entire halo , and local metallicities can reach values of up to solar : see figure  [ fig : metalmap ] .",
    "we have investigated the properties of high redshift ( @xmath186 ) grb - dla absorbers in a series of galaxy formation simulations , on the assumption that long duration grbs are associated with the death of massive , short - lived stars .",
    "following our success in matching properties of traditional dlas along randomly chosen sightlines to quasars ( p08 ) , we used our results to interpret observational differences between the populations , finding two primary distinctions .",
    "firstly , because the star formation rate scales more steeply with virial mass ( @xmath89 , p08 figure 13 ) than does the neutral hydrogen cross - section ( approximately @xmath88 , although a single power - law is an oversimplification ; p08 figure 4 ) , the halos contributing most to the grb - dla incidence rate are considerably more massive than those contributing to the qso - dla incidence rate ( section [ sec : origins - grb - dlas ] ) .",
    "the dominant contribution for grb - dlas arises in halos with @xmath3 ; for qso - dlas this range is an order of magnitude lower , @xmath187 .",
    "while this argument obviously relies on our simulated scalings being accurate , there are many reasons for being cautiously optimistic : in particular , the simultaneous matching of the qso - dla metallicity distribution ( p08 ) and the galaxy mass - metallicity relation @xcite is hard to reproduce unless the underlying relations are realistic . @xcite",
    "have previously reported that grb metallicities can be accounted for if a holmberg - like relation , @xmath188 with @xmath189 , holds at high redshift ; here we have shown that the metallicities are reproduced and that just such a scaling arises naturally from cosmological simulations ( albeit with @xmath190 ) . the difference in mass ranges",
    "has some effect on the predicted properties of the hosting halos , most notably lifting the mean stellar metallicity from @xmath175 for qso - dlas to @xmath173 for grb - dlas .",
    "however , these effects are relatively small compared to the large spread of hosting halo properties in both populations , reflecting that incidence rates for both classes are a shallow function of virial mass .",
    "@xcite took a reciprocal approach , using observed galaxy properties to determine the likely underlying population of host objects .",
    "their results showed that grb hosts at @xmath33 have typical masses @xmath191 which does not agree with our analysis .",
    "this may be because @xcite adopt , on an observational basis , the star formation efficiency ( rate of star formation per unit stellar mass ) as an indicator of grb probability .",
    "our simulations do not suggest a strong link between star formation efficiency defined in this way and the grb event rate ; if extended observational analysis continues to point to such a link , further investigation will be required .",
    "the second distinguishing effect we find is that the grb - dlas arise in gas closer to the centres of the hosting objects than a conventional dla .",
    "while resolution artifacts cloud an exact interpretation of some details , we are confident in concluding that approximately @xmath192 of grb - dlas arise less than @xmath1 from the centre of their parent halo , whereas this figure for qso - dlas is just @xmath193 ( and , accordingly , the qso - dlas have a higher median impact parameter of @xmath94 ) .",
    "similarly , grb - dlas tend to be more concentrated along the line of sight ; we defined the measure @xmath91 to be the distance over which half the total hydrogen column density is accumulated and found that this took a median value of @xmath1 for grb - dlas and @xmath194 for qso - dlas .",
    "this indicates that the neutral hydrogen seen in grb afterglow spectra is not to be found in the immediate circumstellar environment , but is spread over an extended region ",
    "although a detailed analysis would require better resolution of the ism than our present simulations are able to provide .",
    "we investigated the neutral hydrogen column density ( sections   [ sec : column - dens - distr ] ,  [ sec : high - column - dens ] ) and the metallicity ( section [ sec : metall - distr ] ) distributions of our simulated absorbers , finding good observational agreement in both cases except for a deficiency in low column density ( @xmath195 ) absorbers .",
    "the simulated neutral hydrogen column densities , as for the observed grb absorbers , are much higher than those seen in intervening dlas .",
    "we conclude that this is largely due to the lowered impact parameters , with the change in the masses of halos having a secondary effect ( for instance , figure 8 of p08 shows that the relation between column density and halo mass is relatively weak ) .",
    "the metallicities are higher , by almost a factor of ten , than those seen in qso - dlas  even if grb - dlas can only arise from stellar populations with @xmath136 .",
    "this suggests that the observed population of high redshift grb - dlas and grb hosts do not pose any severe problems for the typical collapsar grb paradigms , counter to the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite , but in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the ineffectiveness of a metallicity ceiling on the grb - dla progenitors to limit the metallicity of the overall sightline population arises because , within each protogalaxy , neutral gas metallicity dispersions of up to an order of magnitude are possible ( greatly exceeding the @xmath196 allowed by @xcite 2007 ) . in our picture",
    "grbs now originate in dense regions with lower metallicities , but they are typically still close to gas with significantly higher metallicity ( figure [ fig : metalmap ] ) which consequently presents a large covering fraction . furthermore high mass , metal rich halos continue to contribute significantly to the grb rate : even for our most massive galaxy at @xmath33 ( with a mean neutral gas metallicty of @xmath197 ) , @xmath198 of the star - forming gas mass remains at low metallicities @xmath136 .",
    "we note that , since our simulations include a turbulent metal diffusion term , this dispersion can not be attributed solely to numerical effects ( section  [ sec : techniques ] ) .",
    "the leaves open the question of whether the observational situation at lower redshifts ( @xmath199 ) , where host galaxies may be less massive than typical hosts of supernovae ( @xcite 2006 ; although see @xcite 2008 , @xcite 2009 ) , can be quantitatively reconciled with less pronounced differences between supernovae and grb hosts at high redshift .",
    "a natural explanation is simply that at earlier times mean metallicities are lower and high metallicity gas is typically less well mixed @xcite . in principle",
    "we could probe this claim in our simulations , but such work is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "one of the shortcomings of our work is the unreliability of our predicted @xmath103 escape fraction of uv photons from gamma ray burst regions .",
    "this is somewhat lower than recent simulations of escape fractions ( @xmath200 from results by @xcite 2008 ; between @xmath9 and @xmath193 according to @xcite 2006 ; or , for halos with masses @xmath201 , @xcite 2009 reported escape fractions between @xmath202 and @xmath203 in very high resolution eulerian simulations ) .",
    "furthermore it falls short of constraints on escape fractions from comparing rest - frame uv emission on either side of the lyman limit break ( @xmath200 , although this value is sensitive to assumptions about the dust extinction ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and most directly underpredicts the escape fraction implied by current grb observations ( @xmath204 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also visible directly in figure [ fig : colden ] ) .",
    "however , most importantly , it is not robust to changes in our sightline construction algorithms ( section [ sec : column - dens - distr ] ) , unlike our other reported results .",
    "the fragility reflects enormous uncertainties in this regime .",
    "in addition to the inherent complexities in accurately simulating absorption systems , for grb - dlas one can no longer justify the assumption that local ionizing uv sources are unimportant compared with cosmological sources ( section [ sec : radi - trans ] ) .",
    "we have taken a simple pragmatic approach to this problem by noting that the ionizing radiation of local sources is largely absorbed by  regions which we paint into our output .",
    "( more accurate radiative transfer would probably lend confidence to our results , but we caution that without properly resolved  regions the physical meaning of even the most precise transfer algorithms is still obscure . ) furthermore , there is a sensitivity to the energy injection from supernovae , as demonstrated by the drop in escape fraction to @xmath120 when triggering grbs based on the star formation rate scaling of our gas particles ( rather than existing young stellar particles which will have injected feedback energy into the nearby ism ) .",
    "finally , if runaway stars are important contributors to the grb incidence rate one could expect a significant increase in the number of low column density absorbers .",
    "there are further complications specific to grb - dlas which we have not specifically addressed .",
    "one is the evidence , from fine - structure transitions , that the neutral phase metals detected in the systems are found at distances ranging from hundreds of parsecs @xcite to as much as a kiloparsec or more .",
    "it is possible that the grb afterglow itself ionizes a significant amount of material along the line of sight . given the known afterglow curves , the ionization of material by the grb itself has been advanced as a possible explanation ( e.g. 2007 ) , although whether bubbles of more than a few parsecs radius can be ionized is unclear ( e.g. @xcite 2008 ) .",
    "the afterglow - ionizing scenario is certainly not firmly established : perhaps the hot progenitor stellar populations have already carved out large ionized bubbles within the ism , or the densest knots of gas which are metal rich are simply found at some distance from the grb site ( as we have mentioned above ) .",
    "unfortunately we do not have resolution to probe the required scales reliably , but we did produce comparison statistics in which we ionized all material within a @xmath205 sphere of a grb site before measuring its sightline properties .",
    "this led to a decrease in the numbers of very high column density absorbers ( @xmath206 ) , reducing the median to @xmath207 .",
    "while the agreement of our simulations with observations was therefore impaired , our results were not qualitatively altered .",
    "simulations with better resolution of the ism will be necessary to properly constrain the effects of grbs on their immediate environment .",
    "similarly we have been unable to make a quantitative assessment of the possible biasing effects of dust .",
    "it is possible that dust obscuration of optical afterglows significantly biases against observing high metallicity , high column density absorbers . indeed",
    "the phenomena of ` dark bursts ' , grbs for which the optical afterglow is not seen or is dimmed by several magnitudes , could be explained if these bursts are simply obscured by large columns of dust @xcite .",
    "however , it appears to be inappropriate to extrapolate the dust columns predicted for quasar absorbers ( by models such as those in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to our simulated grb results : such an approach would significantly over - predict the reddening seen in real grb - dla samples ( for a compilation see * ? ? ? * ) and would suggest , for example , that grb 080607 ( with @xmath208 , @xmath209 according to @xcite 2009 ) should have been completely dark . either",
    "the grb - dlas arise in regions in which simple scalings of dust columns fail , or perhaps the intense outgoing radiation is able to rapidly destroy dust even beyond the hydrogen ionization front .",
    "whatever the explanation , we have been unable to make full sense of this issue in our present exploration and leave its resolution to future work .    despite these difficulties ,",
    "we have affirmed in the present work that grb - dlas offer a new insight into the inner regions of the protogalactic population at high redshifts .",
    "their basic statistics can be matched by simple techniques applied to existing cosmological simulations .",

    "<S> because of large internal dispersions in gas metallicities , this agreement is not significantly compromised by imposing a cut - off on the metallicity of stars able to launch grbs ( @xmath11 ) , confounding claims that the observed metallicity of grb - dlas poses a severe challenge to current grb models .    </S>",
