    "goldston and gonek @xcite , exploring the relation between the functions @xmath6 and @xmath10 , used the classical beurling - selberg majorants and minorants of characteristic functions of intervals , together with the guinand - weil explicit formula for the zeros of @xmath1 , to obtain the bound @xmath27 to obtain their bound , they made use of the extremal functions for @xmath28 , available in the framework of carneiro and vaaler @xcite .",
    "their method likely represents the limit of existing methods for bounding @xmath29 assuming rh .",
    "later , carneiro and chandee @xcite extended this result to bounding @xmath30 for @xmath31 in the critical strip , by using the extremal majorants and minorants for the family of functions @xmath32 .",
    "this extremal problem is solvable in the the more general setting of gaussian subordination for even functions using the work of carneiro , littmann , and vaaler @xcite .",
    "inspired by these previous results , we use similar techniques to bound the auxiliary function @xmath33 there has been some earlier work on establishing explicit bounds for @xmath34 .",

    "sufficiently large we have @xmath40 where the terms @xmath22 in the above inequalities are @xmath41 .    as a consequence of the above theorem , we are able to improve goldston and gonek s bound for @xmath6 by a factor of 2 .",
    "[ th1 ] assume rh . for @xmath4",
    "sufficiently large we have @xmath42    previously , it had been suggested that the estimate in ( [ gogo ] ) had attained the limit of existing methods for bounding @xmath43 however , the result in the above theorem is actually not too surprising since goldston and gonek derived their inequality for @xmath6 from the bound @xmath44 where @xmath45 instead of by bounding @xmath6 directly . given the range of uniformity of this estimate , it is reasonable to believe that there is a @xmath4 and an @xmath46 such that simultaneously @xmath6 is large and positive , and @xmath47 is large and negative ( or vice versa ) for some @xmath46 satisfying @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the estimate for @xmath49 in ( [ stplushminusst ] ) suggests the pointwise bound @xmath50 provided by theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of theorem [ th1 ] , we are able to rederive ( but not improve ) the bound in ( [ stplushminusst ] ) .",
    "this is an important observation since goldston and gonek showed how to use ( [ stplushminusst ] ) to bound the maximum multiplicity of a zero of @xmath1 and how to bound the maximum gap between consecutive zeros of the riemann zeta - function on the critical line ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 1 ) ) .",
    "hence , theorem [ th1 ] can be used to recover these results about the zeros of @xmath1 , but not to improve them .    in section 4 of this paper",
    ", we will show how to obtain the bound for @xmath6 in theorem [ th1 ] by relating the size of @xmath6 to the size of the functions @xmath51 for @xmath52 and then invoking theorem [ th2 ] .",
    "this is reminiscent of the work of selberg @xcite , ghosh @xcite , and tsang @xcite who used the behavior of the function @xmath53 to prove omega - theorems for @xmath6 and to study the sign changes of @xmath6 .",
    "although the method described above can be used to improve existing bounds for @xmath6 , this approach does not bound @xmath6 directly .",
    "rather , it derives the bound for @xmath6 from a corresponding bound on @xmath34 which in turn arises from an application of the theory of extremal functions to @xmath39 a natural question to ask is whether the theory of extremal functions of exponential type could be applied directly to bound @xmath43 it turns out that a direct approach is possible and , in section [ sec : stviaextremal ] , we show how to obtain the bound for @xmath6 in theorem [ th1 ] via extremal functions .",
    "however , in constrast with previous work on optimal bounds in the theory of @xmath1 , this approach to bound @xmath6 is connected with the beurling - selberg extremal problem for an _ odd function _",
    ", namely @xmath54 it is shown in section [ sec : stviaextremal ] that the solution of this particular problem is provided by the recent gaussian subordination framework for truncated ( and odd ) functions of carneiro and littmann @xcite .",
    "the bound for @xmath6 via the extremal function approach is the same as the one deduced from the estimate of @xmath51 .",
    "this should be expected since these two parallel approaches use essentially the same methods , and the same assumptions .",
    "the main assumption is that all non - trivial zeros of @xmath1 lie on the critical line , since the method depends on an explicit formula which relates information on the zeta - function to the zeros of @xmath1 and the prime numbers .",
    "the theory of extremal functions is used to majorize certain naturally occuring test functions . note that we use the the function @xmath55 to bound @xmath6 where @xmath56 is the function used to bound @xmath34 . since @xmath57 almost everywhere , it is not surprising that the two methods lead to the same result ( namely theorem [ th1 ] ) .",
    "although the inequality in theorem [ th1 ] appears to be the best known bound for @xmath6 assuming the riemann hypothesis , the true size of @xmath6 is perhaps much smaller .",
    "for instance , a heuristic argument of farmer , gonek and hughes @xcite suggests that @xmath58 this result seems unattainable using the present method without a significant breakthrough in estimating certain prime number sums that arise when applying the guinand - weil explicit formula . in the present article",
    ", these sums are estimated trivially .",
    "before proving theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th1 ] , we collect some preliminary results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our bounds for @xmath38 require extremal majorants and minorants for the function @xmath59 .",
    "the connection between @xmath34 and @xmath60 is made explicit in the following lemma .",
    "[ lemmafst ] assume rh .",

    "then @xmath67 is an entire function of order 1 and the zeros of @xmath67 correspond to the non - trivial zeros of @xmath1 . by hadamard s factorization formula ( cf .",
    "* chapter 12 ) ) , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 runs over the non - trivial zeros of @xmath1 , @xmath70 is a constant and @xmath71 .",
    "note that re(@xmath72 is positive and that @xmath73 converges absolutely . assuming the riemann hypothesis",
    ", it follows that @xmath74 hence @xmath75 by stirling s formula for @xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 uniformly for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , say . moreover , for @xmath78 and @xmath80 , if @xmath81 is not a zero of @xmath1 then ( [ n(t ) ] ) implies that the sum over zeros on the right - hand side of converges absolutely ( one can also deduce this from the fact that the product in hadamard s factorization converges absolutely to a non - zero value ) . in case when @xmath81 corresponds to a zero of @xmath1 , both sides of are @xmath82 . inserting ( [ eqn : mains3 ] ) into ( [ eqn : mains2 ] ) , we deduce that @xmath83 where the function @xmath60 is defined by @xmath84 and the interchange of the integral and the sum is justified by monotone convergence since the terms involved are non - negative .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "_ in the proof of the above lemma , the first step is to divide @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "this simplifies matters when applying stirling s formula and ensures that the resulting sum over zeros of @xmath1 is absolutely convergent and contains only non - negative terms , which justifies the interchange of the integrals .",
    "a similar trick is necessary in the proof of lemma [ s(t)sum ] , below . in particular",
    ", we need to subtract a factor of @xmath87 in a certain integral representation of @xmath6 in order to ensure the absolute convergence of the resulting sum over zeros of @xmath1 .    in section [ sec : stviaextremal ] , we bound @xmath6 directly using extremal functions .",
    "this requires an expression relating @xmath6 to the function @xmath88 mentioned in the introduction .",

    "now suppose that @xmath4 is not the ordinate of a zero of @xmath1 .",
    "then , from ( [ partialfrac ] ) and the riemann hypothesis , it follows that @xmath99 where the interchange of the integral and the sum is justified by dominated convergence since @xmath100 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "the main idea in the proofs of theorem [ th2 ] and theorem [ th1 ] is to bound @xmath34 and @xmath6 from above and below by replacing the function @xmath60 in and @xmath89 in by an appropriate majorant or minorant of exponential type ( thus with a compactly supported fourier transform by the paley - wiener theorem ) .",
    "we then apply the following version of the guinand - weil explicit formula which connects these sums over the zeros of the zeta - function to sums of the fourier transforms evaluated at the prime powers .",

    "this is a classical problem in harmonic analysis and approximation theory , considered by bernstein , akhiezer , krein , nagy , and others , dating back to at least 1938 ( see for instance @xcite ) . for applications to analytic number theory ,",

    "a minimizer of the integral is called an extremal majorant of @xmath218 .",
    "extremal minorants are defined analogously .",
    "beurling independently started working on this extremal one - sided problem in the late 1930s , and obtained the solution for @xmath219 and an inequality for almost periodic functions in an unpublished manuscript .",
    "later , selberg @xcite recognized that the one - sided extremals for the signum function could produce majorants and minorants for characteristic functions of intervals , and used this fact to obtain a sharp form of the large sieve inequality . for a historical account of the early developments of this theory we refer to j. d. vaaler s classical paper @xcite .",
    "since here we are mainly interested in the one - sided version of this problem , we refer to it as the _ beurling - selberg extremal problem_.    the applications to number theory rely heavily on the fact that these extremal functions have distributional fourier transforms compactly supported in the interval @xmath220 $ ] , as a consequence of the paley - wiener theorem .",
    "an account of these applications must certainly include hilbert - type inequalities @xcite , erds - turn discrepancy inequalities @xcite , optimal approximations of periodic functions by trigonometric polynomials @xcite , tauberian theorems @xcite , higher dimensional diophantine problems @xcite , and more recently , bounds for the riemann zeta - function under the riemann hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the subtle point of this theory is that given any @xmath221 there is no general technique which is known to produce a solution of this extremal problem .",
    "there are , however , other examples of families for which the solution has been achieved .",
    "this includes the exponential functions @xmath222 , @xmath223 , by graham and vaaler in @xcite , and the odd and truncated power functions @xmath224 and @xmath225 , @xmath226 , by littmann in @xcite .",
