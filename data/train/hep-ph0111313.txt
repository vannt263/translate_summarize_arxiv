    "there are many reasons why we believe that the standard model is incomplete and there must be physics beyond .",
    "one is the plethora of  fundamental parameters , \" for example quark masses , mixing angles , etc ... the standard model can not explain the smallness of the weak scale compared to the gut or planck scales ; this is often called  the hierarchy problem . \"",
    "it is believed that the ckm source of cp violation in the standard model is not large enough to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite ; we can also take the view that we will discover additional large unexpected effects in @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 decays . finally , gravity is not incorporated .",
    "john ellis said  my personal interest in cp violation is driven by the search for physics beyond the standard model \" @xcite .",
    "we must realize that _ all _ our current measurements are a combination of standard model and new physics ; any proposed models must satisfy current constraints .",
    "since the standard model tree level diagrams are probably large , lets consider them a background to new physics .",
    "therefore loop diagrams and cp violation are the best places to see new physics .",
    "the most important current constraints on new physics models are    * the neutron electric dipole moment , @xmath2e - cm .",
    "* @xmath3 and @xmath4 . *",
    "cp violation in @xmath5 decay , @xmath6 .",
    "* @xmath7 mixing parameter @xmath8 ps@xmath9 .",
    "we can look for new physics either in the context of specific models or more generically , for deviations from the standard model expectation .",
    "one example is to examine the rare decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 for branching ratios and polarizations . according to greub et al .",
    "@xcite ,  especially the decay into @xmath12 yields a wealth of new information on the form of the new interactions since the dalitz plot is sensitive to subtle interference effects . \"",
    "another important tactic is to test for inconsistencies in standard model predictions independent of specific non - standard models .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix allows us to construct six relationships .",
    "these may be thought of as triangles in the complex plane shown in fig .",
    "[ six_tri ] .",
    "all six of these triangles can be constructed knowing four and only four independent angles @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these are defined as : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 can be used instead of @xmath15 or @xmath16 . )",
    "two of the phases @xmath16 and @xmath15 are probably large while @xmath17 is estimated to be small @xmath180.02 , but measurable , while @xmath19 is likely to be much smaller .",
    "it has been pointed out by silva and wolfenstein @xcite that measuring only angles may not be sufficient to detect new physics .",
    "for example , suppose there is new physics that arises in @xmath20 mixing .",
    "let us assign a phase @xmath21 to this new physics .",
    "if we then measure cp violation in @xmath22 and eliminate any penguin pollution problems in using @xmath23 , then we actually measure @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "so while there is new physics , we miss it , because @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the angle @xmath17 , defined in equation  [ eq : chi ] , can be extracted by measuring the time dependent cp violating asymmetry in the reaction @xmath28@xmath29 , or if one s detector is incapable of quality photon detection , the @xmath30 final state can be used . however , in this case there are two vector particles in the final state , making this a state of mixed cp , requiring a time - dependent angular analysis to extract @xmath17 , that requires large statistics .",
    "measurements of the magnitudes of ckm matrix elements all come with theoretical errors",
    ". some of these are hard to estimate .",
    "the best measured magnitude is that of @xmath31 .",
    "silva and wolfenstein @xcite @xcite show that the standard model can be checked in a profound manner by seeing if : @xmath32 here the precision of the check will be limited initially by the measurement of @xmath33 , not of @xmath34 .",
    "this check can reveal new physics , even if other measurements have not shown any anomalies .",
    "other relationships to check include : @xmath35    the astute reader will have noticed that these two equations lead to the non - trivial relationship : @xmath36 this constrains these two magnitudes in terms of two of the angles .",
    "note , that it is in principle possible to determine the magnitudes of @xmath37 and @xmath38 without model dependent errors by measuring @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 accurately .",
    "alternatively , @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath34 can be used to give a much more precise value than is possible at present with direct methods .",
    "for example , once @xmath16 and @xmath15 are known @xmath39 .",
    "table  [ table : reqmeas ] lists the most important physics quantities and the decay modes that can be used to measure them .",
    "the necessary detector capabilities include the ability to collect purely hadronic final states labeled here as ",

    "we observed that a difference between cp asymmetries in @xmath22 and @xmath50 arises in the mssm due to a cp asymmetry in the decay phase .",
    "it is possible to observe this directly by looking for a cp asymmetry in @xmath46 . the standard model and mssm diagrams are shown in fig .  [ phi_k_mssm ] .",
