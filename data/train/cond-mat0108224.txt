    "the steady state solution @xmath21 of ( [ e : master ] ) is found as ( setting @xmath22 from now on , for convenience )    @xmath23 \\label{e : st3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , the asymptotic jump rate , is fixed by normalization of @xmath26 .",
    "it is straightforward to show from ( [ e : st3 ] ) that in the limit of slow flows @xmath27 , the steady state stress response @xmath28 ( in an obvious notation ) is always linear : @xmath29 .",
    "hence there is no yield stress for any choice of @xmath30 .",
    "this contrasts with a model having an exponential distribution of barrier heights @xmath11 for different elements , which does show onset of a yield stress , connected with the presence of a glass transition , as @xmath17 is reduced @xcite . for monodisperse @xmath11 , as here , there is no such transition .",
    "we now show that the steady state flow curve , for _ any _ choice of function @xmath20 , has a monotonically increasing @xmath31 .",
    "first , by differentiating @xmath32 and using ( [ e : st3 ] ) , we find @xmath33 similarly , the normalisation integral for @xmath26 can be differentiated with respect to @xmath7 to give @xmath34 combining these two expressions ( with @xmath35 ) produces @xmath36 which is positive since @xmath37 is monotone increasing .",
    "thus there are no regions on the flow curve with negative slope , and for no choice of @xmath20 does one expect any shear - banding instability to arise . however , the argument does not prove that a steady state is ever actually achieved .",
    "we have found that it is reached under conditions of imposed strain @xmath38 , but _ not _ under an imposed stress @xmath3 ( for appropiate @xmath20 ) , for which the model exhibits temporal oscillations instead .",
    "this numerical finding ( detailed below ) is also supported by a linear stability analysis for perturbations about the steady state flow , described fully in  @xcite .",
    "such an analysis shows that the transient behaviour close to steady state is never a real exponential decay but always has an oscillatory component .",
    "when the decay rate of these oscillations changes sign , the flow becomes unstable to permanent oscillation .",
    "the time evolution of the system at fixed stress was studied numerically by methods described in @xcite .",
    "( the problem is not standard and significant amounts of computer time were required to achieve reliable results . )",
    "a range of different functions @xmath20 and of @xmath11 values were tried .",
    "varying @xmath3 over a wide range of values in each case reveals that steady flow is always reached for sufficiently small and sufficiently large imposed stresses ; but for intermediate @xmath3 , an oscillatory regime is observed whenever @xmath20 is strongly enough decreasing .",
    "it is impractical to explore the entire function space for @xmath20 so at present the precise criteria for the presence of oscillations are not known .    within the oscillatory regime",
    ", we have so far found only single - period oscillations with no sign of period doubling or other more complex nonsteady behaviour that might point to the onset of rheo - chaos in some parts of the parameter space .",
    "some examples of the oscillatory behaviour are given in fig .",
    "[ f : osc_nonmon_eg](a ) . to obtain these results we took @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42",
    "; in addition we set @xmath43 .",
    "the strain @xmath38 is shown for three different imposed  @xmath3 . on close inspection",
    "the oscillations , after a brief transient , appear perfectly periodic .",
    "this applies not only in the stress but in the underlying distribution @xmath5 , which determines the future evolution .",
    "hence there seems little doubt that these oscillations will persist indefinitely .    from fig .",
    "[ f : osc_nonmon_eg](a ) it is remarkable that the _ mean _ strain rate @xmath44 , defined as @xmath7 averaged over a single period of oscillation , is clearly a _ decreasing _ function of  @xmath3 , in complete contrast to the monotonic , steady state , flow curve .",
    "the time averaged values @xmath44 as read off from the simulations are plotted against @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ f : osc_flowcurve](b ) , overlayed with the steady state flow curve . within the oscillatory regime ,",
    "the @xmath44 line deviates from the flow curve to the extent that it loses monotonicity over a large interval of  @xmath3 .",
    "if the oscillations were not detected but only the average behaviour measured , this would resemble the flow curve of a discontinuously shear - thickening system close to a jamming transition , although in that case shear banding could be expected as well .",
    "( such a flow curve is indeed found in models where @xmath17 depends not on the local stress @xmath1 but only on its global mean , @xmath3 ; see @xcite . )",
    "upper and lower transition points between oscillatory and steady flow can be seen in the figure . at each transition point",
    "@xmath45 , the period of oscillation remains finite whilst the amplitude vanishes smoothly according to @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "as we discuss in our longer work  @xcite , technical difficulties have prevented us from reliably fixing the asymptotic values of  @xmath48 .",
    "in particular we have been unable to rule out @xmath49 for both transitions , as expected for a hopf bifurcation  @xcite ( although since the control parameter is an integral constraint , it is not clear to us if it should be a hopf bifurcation ) .",
    "though always perfectly periodic , the waveform of the oscillations varies with  @xmath3 .",
    "close to either transition , the oscillations are near - sinusoidal , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : osc_sine](a ) . further into the oscillatory regime , @xmath7",
    "can no longer be decomposed into a single harmonic , but instead approaches a waveform in which most of the variation in @xmath7 is compressed into a small fraction of the total period of oscillation .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ f : osc_sine](b ) .",
    "this behaviour at first appears to be similar to the ` stick  slip ' motion observed in systems such as earthquakes  @xcite , ultra - thin liquid films  @xcite and granular media  @xcite .",
    "however , the underlying physics in our model seems to be somewhat different to these examples .",
    "indeed , stick  slip is usually viewed as a surface phenomenon , whereas the model studied in this paper has no surface and describes only bulk effects .",
    "irrespective of the waveform , the product of @xmath44 and the period of oscillation @xmath50 is approximately constant , @xmath51 for this example .",
    "this will be explained below in terms of the evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "snapshots of @xmath5 during a single period of oscillation are given in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_mono ] . the mechanism behind the oscillations can be qualitatively described in terms of two coexisting populations of elements  a ` hot ' population of unstrained or slightly strained elements with @xmath52 , and hence a high effective temperature @xmath20 ; and a ` cold ' population of elements with @xmath53 and therefore a low @xmath20 .",
    "starting at a time when @xmath54 is near to is minimum value , corresponding to the first snapshot in the figure , the stress  weighted yield rate @xmath55 for both populations of elements is low .",
    "this is because the hot elements have small  @xmath1 , whereas the cold elements have a low yield rate @xmath0 .",
    "thus the strain rate @xmath7 required to maintain the imposed constant mean stress  @xmath3 , which is @xmath56 ( as seen by multiplying ( [ e : master ] ) by @xmath57 and integrating ) , is also low .",
    "although @xmath54 is small in this state , it is nonetheless non  zero , and therefore the strains @xmath1 of the cold elements increase according to @xmath58 .",
    "this decreases their effective energy barrier @xmath59 , increasing their hop rate and therefore the rate of stress lost due to to cold elements yielding .",
    "thus @xmath60 will also increase , which accelerates the rate at which the cold elements yield , and so on .",
    "this description is that of a _ positive feedback loop _ that causes @xmath7 to increase at ever faster rates until all of the cold elements have been depleted . the second snapshot in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_mono ] show the state of the system shortly before this has happened .",
    "while @xmath54 is high , the hot elements are becoming rapidly strained and have little time to yield before crossing over into the cold region with large  @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath5 is flat for small  @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath54 again decreases , this flat part of the distribution will start to decay as the elements within it yield .",
    "however , the yield rate depends on  @xmath20 , and since this changes to a lower value at @xmath61 , @xmath5 will decay more rapidly for @xmath1 smaller than @xmath62 than for @xmath1 greater than @xmath62 .",
    "thus a dip will occur around the point @xmath63 , which can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_mono ] .",
    "this dip becomes more pronounced with time until the system can again be viewed as coexisting ` hot ' and ` cold ' populations , when the cycle begins again .",
    "a possible interpretation of the parameter @xmath64 , defined previously , is that it is the amount by which the system needs to be strained until the positive feedback loop just described starts to dominate the system behaviour , causing it to ` reset ' to the start of its cycle .",
    "if this is correct , then @xmath64 should correspond to the point at which highly  strained elements have the same yield rate as unstrained elements , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 .",
    "rough calculations based on this assumption give @xmath66}$ ] , which for this example predicts @xmath67 , in fair agreement with the observed value .",
    "within a simple model of shear thickening , we have found regimes where steady flow at constant imposed stress is unstable and temporal oscillation occurs instead .",
    "known instances of such rheological instability have often been explained in terms of the spatial coexistence of subpopulations , or phases .",
    "for instance , the temporal oscillations in viscosity observed in wormlike micelles under an imposed stress was attributed to a slowly fluctuating interface between a fluid phase and shear - induced structures  @xcite . for surfactant solutions in the lyotropic lamellar phase ,",
    "it was attributed to coexisting ordered and disordered phases  @xcite . by contrast",
    ", the temporal oscillations observed in our model arise even though they are by assumption spatially homogeneous , and the flow curves are everywhere monotonic .",
    "it may be that , in practice , such rheo - oscillations will always be coupled to spatial heterogeneity of some sort .",
    "experiments are not advanced enough to indicate whether this is the case .",
    "one distinguishing feature of our equations is the role of memory effects , rather than inertia , in allowing oscillations . in our model ,",
    "the memory resides in @xmath5 which can have different shapes for the same applied stress @xmath68 .",
    "there may thus be a link to work on ` delay differential equations ' in which a first order differential equation for a state variable contains a feedback term that depends on the same state variable at an earlier time @xcite .",
    "such equations are capable of showing a range of instabilities , including chaos , despite the absence of inertia .",
    "the nature of this link remains a topic of current research .",
    "its exploration might help answer the following question : what features , if any , could be added to our simple rheological model of shear thickening to allow rheo - chaos to arise _ without _ coupling to spatial degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this could in turn help answer another important question : what is the dimension of the strange attractors that arise in rheo - chaos @xcite ?",
    "in conclusion we suggest that the study of temporal ( or spatiotemporal ) pattern formation in non - newtonian flows ( at effectively zero reynolds number ) will form a major topic of experimental and theoretical research in the coming years .    _",
