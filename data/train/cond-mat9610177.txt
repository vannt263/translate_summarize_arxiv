    "the starting point of our considerations is the hierarchical clustering of the spectrum of harper s equation ( [ harper ] ) . by inspecting the band structure of this equation as a function of @xmath0 ,",
    "hofstadter @xcite noticed that for a given @xmath0 it consists of three parts , one central cluster ( s ) and two side clusters ( r ) that are closely related to the full spectra of harper s equation with renormalised values of @xmath0 , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the fractional part ( for an illustration see @xcite ) .",
    "these clustering rules , denoted as hostadter rules , have been derived afterwards by different methods @xcite .",
    "until now , however , for practical calculations , it has always been assumed that the side clusters and the central cluster are simply rescaled versions of the full spectrum for the renormalized @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore only the case of the golden and silver mean ( @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] ) has been considered .",
    "these particular values of @xmath0 are fixed points of both maps , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and therefore self - consistent equations for the fractal dimension @xmath9 can be obtained easily @xcite .    in order to refine the assumption that the side and central clusters are merely homogeneously rescaled versions of the full spectrum for the renormalized @xmath0 , we rewrite hofstadter s clustering rules in a more quantitative way .",
    "consider the spectrum of a rational approximant @xmath28 with @xmath12 bands .",
    "the partition of these bands on the lower side cluster , the central cluster and the upper side cluster is given according to @xmath29 , where `` @xmath30 '' denotes the denominator .",
    "therefore we can write the @xmath12 energy values @xmath31 ( upper or lower band edge , for large @xmath12 , in which we are interested , the bandwidths go to zero , so there is no difference ) in the following form @xcite : @xmath32 the functions @xmath33 are the fingerprint of hofstadter s rules and are essential for calculating the fractal dimensions of the spectrum for a given @xmath0 .",
    "the irrational number @xmath0 can be developped in a continued fraction .",
    "its truncation at the @xmath34th level yields the approximant of @xmath0 of generation @xmath34 .",
    "an essential point is that @xmath33 only depend weakly on the generation of the approximant of @xmath0 .    for a quasiperiodic tight - binding model where the hofstadter rules also apply , the functions @xmath35 have been calculated in a linear approximation by means of a renormalization approach for the case of the golden mean . since @xmath36 is invariant under @xmath27 and @xmath26 , the hofstadter rules close up after the first step , leading to a self - consistent equation for the fractal dimensions @xcite .",
    "a generic quadratic irrational number is not invariant under @xmath26 and @xmath27 , but successive applications of @xmath26 and/or @xmath27 involve a finite number of different irrational numbers .",
    "this can be seen , if the renormalization equations for @xmath0 are rewritten for the continued fraction expansion @xmath37 $ ] : @xmath38 & \\text{if $ a_{1 } > 1 $ } , \\\\ { } [ 0 ;   a_{3},a_{4},a_{5 } , \\cdots ] & \\text{if $ a_{1 } = 1 $ } \\end{cases } \\label{equ : r - rules}\\ ] ] and @xmath39 & \\text{if $ a_{1}>2 $ } , \\\\   { } [ 0;a_{3},a_{4},a_{5},\\cdots ] & \\text{if $ a_{1 } = 2 $ } , \\\\   { } [ 0;a_{2}-1,a_{3},a_{4},\\cdots ] & \\text{if $ a_{1}=1 , a_{2}>1 $ } ,",

    "thus we can assign to each cycle a `` generation loss '' @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "[ tableau ] ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will begin by dealing with the problem for the case @xmath56 , which are fixed points of the hofstadter rules .",

    "we obtain the two local scaling exponents at the edges and the center of the band : @xmath67 and @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the generation losses of the cycles @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , within this approximation a self - consistent equation for @xmath71 , the legendre transformed of @xmath72 , can be given directly : @xmath73 for the case of the golden number , this equation has recently been used to derive the multifractal properties of a tight - binding hamiltonian associated with the fibonacci sequence in the limit of strong modulation @xcite . despite of being a good first approximation",
    ", the corresponding @xmath72 has two serious drawbacks : first , @xmath74 or @xmath75 ( depending on the parameter ) does not vanish in contradiction to numerical simulations and indications from the trace map approach @xcite .",
    "this problem is due to the oversimplification of @xmath76 by three linear pieces , yielding a artificial degeneration of the widths of the bands ( @xmath77 bands of @xmath78 ones have the same widths ) , which leads to @xmath79 .",
    "second , in this approach the extremal scaling properties are found at the band edges or at the center of the spectrum .",
    "this is , however , by far not the general case .",
    "it is true for @xmath80 for both the harper model and the quasiperiodic hamiltonian mentioned above , but neither for @xmath81 , nor for higher irrational numbers @xmath1 , n \\ge 3 $ ] .    in order to construct an approach eliminating these two problems",
    ", we consider the mapping of the spectrum by the renormalization flow as a discrete dynamical system . for @xmath80 and @xmath82 the spectral measure is given by the invariant measure of the map @xmath57 .",
    "the band edges and the band center are attracting fixed points of @xmath57 , thus giving rise to nontrivial scaling behavior as we have seen above . to get accurate approximations of the @xmath72-curves , however , we have to take into account higher periodic orbits of the underlying dynamical systems . the simplest approximation is to include the orbit @xmath83 of period two .",
    "the energies of the two ( symmetric ) fixed points are given by @xmath84 .",
    "therefore we find for the corresonding scaling factor @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the local contraction factor at the fixed points of order two : @xmath87 taking into account the three contraction factors @xmath88 ( denoted as @xmath89-model in the following ) we arrive at the following self - consistent equation for @xmath90 : @xmath91 if @xmath86 equals @xmath92 equation ( [ equ:3z ] ) reduces to ( [ equ:2z ] ) .",
    "the minimal and maximal dimensions for the @xmath89-model are given by @xmath93 . by performing the legendre transformation of ( [ equ:3z ] ) we find the correct behavior @xmath94 .",
    "while for the golden number @xmath95 , i.e. the maximal scaling exponent occurs at the center of the spectrum , for the silver number the maximal dimension is given by @xmath96 , i.e. the bands of maximal widths are not at the center of the spectrum , but at the energy given by @xmath84 .",
    "therefore a linear approximation of @xmath33 ( i.e. two scaling factors , one for the central , and one for the side bands ) is not sufficent for explaining @xmath17 and @xmath18 , even in the case of @xmath97 .",
    "the approximative @xmath72-curves calculated from equation ( [ equ:3z ] ) are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : falpha ] with those obtained by the usual multifractal formalism @xcite .",
    "despite of the simplicity of our model there is a good agreement between the curves . including linearization around further periodic orbits of the non - linear map @xmath35",
    "would yield further quantitative improvement .",
    "we consider the @xmath89-model as the simplest qualitatively correct approximation .",
    "let us note that the thouless property @xmath98 ( i.e. @xmath99 ) yields one linear equation which the three contraction factors have to fulfill : @xmath100 thus , by use of this relation , the calculation of the scaling behavior at the band - edges @xmath92 and at the center of the band @xmath101 would enable to obtain the missing contraction factor @xmath86 .",
    "hitherto we have been considering the case of the fixed points of the hofstadter rules , where the renormalization always yields the same function @xmath102 that can be considered as a dynamical system .",
    "we have shown that taking into account not only the fixed points of this dynamical system , but also a periodic orbit of length two , satisfactory @xmath72-curves can be obtained .",
    "now we generalize this approach to the irrational numbers @xmath103 $ ] that are not fixed points of the hofstadter rules but give rise to a nontrivial cycle structure that has been shown above .    in this case",
    "we have to deal not only with one function @xmath104 but with a whole set of function @xmath105 , where the @xmath106 are the irrational numbers occuring in the flow diagram of @xmath0 . in order to calculate the scaling properties of the spectrum",
    ", we have to consider the cycles of the flow diagram .",
    "to each cycle there is one effective @xmath107 that results from concatenating the corresponding maps @xmath108 for the @xmath106 occuring in this cycle .",
    "for example , the effective map of the cycle @xmath109 in the case of @xmath110 $ ] is given by @xmath111}^{\\pm } \\circ f_{[0;1,\\overline{3}]}^{0 } \\circ f_{[0;\\overline{3}]}^{0}$ ] ( consider equation ( [ hofstadter ] ) and the flow diagram ) .",
    "each of these effective maps can be considered as a dynamical system with fixed points and periodic orbits of different lengths .",
    "now two natural questions arise : which cycle of the renormalization flow does lead to the minimal ( respectively maximal ) local scaling exponent ? which fixed point or periodic orbit of the dynamical system corresponding to this cycle does yield the extremal scaling exponent ? in a first step , these two questions can be addressed numerically by determinating the index of the band of maximal ( respectively minimal ) width and following its way under the renormalization flow .",
    "we find that the the minimal scaling exponent for @xmath1 $ ] occurs for the cycle @xmath26 ( these @xmath0 are fixed points of @xmath26 ) , i.e. the smallest bands occur at the edges of the spectrum . more interestingly , the maximal scaling exponent occurs for the cycle @xmath112 ( @xmath2 odd ) respectively for @xmath113 ( @xmath2 even ) .",
    "the lengths and the structure of these cycles show a striking even - odd effect which is a direct result of the hofstadter rules .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath2 odd the maximal scaling exponent is given by the fixed point of the effective dynamical system , while for even values of @xmath2 the asymmetric orbit of length two yields the maximal scaling exponent .",

    "this is indeed the case , as shows fig .",
    "[ fig : aminmax ] . for a more quantitative discussion of our approximation ,",

    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of the minimal fractal dimension is given by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as the generalized dimensions can be related to the anomalous diffusion exponents of an initially localized wavepacket , our results imply that the time evolution of high order moments @xmath4 is sensible to the parity of @xmath2 .    </S>",

    "<S> journal of physics a _ ( version of )    originally conceived to describe bloch electrons in a magnetic field @xcite , harper s equation @xmath5 has become a subject of its own right . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 is the ratio between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the flux quantum , @xmath6 is related to the wavefunction of the bloch electron and @xmath7 is a phase . </S>",
    "<S> harper - like models are of great interest in a wide variety of physical contexts ( integer quantum hall effect @xcite , superconducting networks @xcite , electrons in superlattices @xcite ) and have given rise to strong interplay between physics and mathematics , as e.g. in the fields of semiclassics @xcite , non commutative geometry @xcite , and , quite recently , quantum groups @xcite . experimental investigations on superconducting networks permit a direct observation of the ground state energy as a function of the magnetic flux @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the resolution of the fine structure of hofstadter s famous butterfly have been made possible by measuring the magnetoresistance oscillations in superlattices @xcite .    during the last years </S>",
    "<S> there has been great interest in the generalized ( rnyi ) dimensions @xcite of the spectral measure of this equation and similar quasiperiodic tight - binding hamiltonians @xcite . for the harper equation </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured that the fractal dimension @xmath8 is exactly 1/2 for typical irrational numbers @xcite . due to the thouless property @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , however , there is a simple argument providing strong evidence for @xmath9 being strictly smaller than @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently a statistical theory has been presented to explain the numerically observed behavior of @xmath9 as a function of the irrational number @xmath1 $ ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> until now there is no detailed investigation how the generalized dimensions @xmath11 for a generic @xmath12 depend on the incommensurability @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the generalized dimensions play an important role for explaining the anomalous diffusion properties of wavepackets found in incommensurable models . </S>",
    "<S> quite recently , the link between @xmath11 and the anomalous diffusion @xmath13 has been made explicit by the relation @xmath14 , which has been verified numerically @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we deal with the problem of the maximal and minimal fractal dimensions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this is intended to be a first step to general values of @xmath12 . while @xmath17 ( as @xmath9 ) exhibits a monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that @xmath18 shows strongly pronounced even - odd oscillations that can be explained by a refinement of the hofstadter rules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior of @xmath17 and @xmath18 has been found for a tight - binding hamiltonian associated with substitution sequences using the trace map approach @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : we begin by reviewing the hofstadter rules ( 1 ) , then we consider the multifractal properties of harper s equation for the case of the golden and silver mean ( 2 ) and finally pass to more general quadratic irrational numbers ( 3 ) , where the minimal and maximal fractal dimensions of the related spectrum will be discussed in detail . </S>"
