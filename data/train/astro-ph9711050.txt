    "the accurate measurement of deviations from smooth hubble flow remains a challenge in observational cosmology .",
    "the lack of a proven redshift ",
    "independent distance estimator applicable beyond  100@xmath3 mpc becomes sorely obvious when claims of large amplitude coherent flows on scales larger than this are made ( lauer & postman 1992:lp ; courteau  1993 ) .",
    "recent observational efforts at constructing relations useful for peculiar velocity measurements (  riess  1995 and giovanelli  1996 : g96 ) challenge the lp result , though with insufficient certainty .",
    "the tully  fisher ( tf ) sample of g96 peculiar velocities is based on a template defined by 555 galaxies in 24 clusters ( giovanelli 1997a , b : g97a , b ) that reaches only to @xmath4  9000  and is thus unable to probe the entire peculiar velocity field the lp flow encompasses , whereas the riess  sample of supernova type ia is too sparsely populated to adequately characterize the local bulk flow ( watkins & feldman 1995 ) .",
    "the existing samples of peculiar velocities at relatively large distances ( @xmath5 100@xmath3 ) need to be enlarged .",
    "we are expanding upon the data of g97a , b by obtaining tf measurements for an all  sky survey of some 50 clusters in the redshift range 5000 @xmath6 20,000 .",
    "the benefits of such an enterprise are twofold .",
    "first , the combination of our data set with that of g97a , b will yield a highly accurate tf template .",
    "the proximity of the extant g97a , b sample allows a wide range of galactic properties to be observed and is thus ideal for determining the slope of the tf relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the redshifts of our sample of relatively distant clusters are less affected by the vagaries of cosmic peculiar motions , a property useful for accurately extracting the tf magnitude offset .",
    "second , the combined data set will cover a much larger volume than that of g97a , b .",
    "recent work by scaramella  ( 1994 ) , tini - brunozzi  ( 1995 ) , and branchini ( 1996 ) suggests that coherent peculiar motions may persist as far as 18,000 ,  the local `` convergence depth '' may extend to  180@xmath3 mpc .",
    "it thus appears crucial to penetrate the local velocity field as deeply as possible : our sample extends out to and possibly beyond the local convergence depth .",
    "this will enable dipole motion measurements over scales large enough to test the lp claim , whose sample has an effective depth of  100@xmath3 .    in order to provide public access to the data on the shortest possible time scale",
    ", we are presenting results of our survey in installments , as we progress in the data reductions for sizable fractions of the cluster set .",
    "dale  ( 1997 ; hereafter `` paper i '' ) presented tf measurements for 84 galaxies in the fields of seven abell clusters . in this paper",
    "we present the project s second data installment : tf measurements for  galaxies in the fields of nine abell clusters , one of which , the field of a2295 , contains two separate clusters ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "the following section reviews the imaging and spectroscopic observations for this data installment .",
    "3 presents the relevant tf data .",
    "imaging for this project began in october 1994 and is now complete , whereas spectroscopy measurements began in december 1995 and are still ongoing .",
    "in the 50 clusters we have chosen to include in our all  sky survey , we plan to obtain 5 to 15 tf measurements per cluster .",
    "including approximately two dozen 21 cm line widths taken earlier by rg and mh , we have thus far obtained  360 ( cluster member ) velocity widths in 48 abell clusters ; we expect to measure  100 more velocity widths .",
    "paper iii of this series will present the final installment of data for the remaining clusters .",
    "all photometric observations were carried out in the @xmath1 band ( kron  cousins filter , central wavelength of 8075   and passband of 1500  ) , matching those in paper i and g97a , b .",
    "the imaging for the clusters in this paper was carried out at the kpno and ctio 0.9 m telescopes .",
    "exposures for each frame amounted to 600 seconds , a time sufficient to reliably reach isophotal levels near 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the clusters a119 , a194 , a2295 , and a2457 were observed at kpno over the course of several observing runs : october 516 1994 , september 1421 1995 , september 21october 1 1995 , november 2026 1995 , october 31november 12 1996 , and february 419 1997 . the clusters a2806 , a114 , a3193 , a3381 , and a3744 were observed at ctio during the runs of february 18 1995 and august 28september 4 1995 .",
    "we used the same observational methods and technical setups described in paper i for the kpno observations ; the only significant difference between imaging at kpno and ctio for our cluster sample is the higher spatial resolution for the data taken at the ctio 0.9 m ( 0.4  pixel@xmath8 versus 0.68  pixel@xmath8 ) , and a smaller field of view ( 14  @xmath9 14  versus 23  @xmath9 23 ) for the 2048@xmath10 ccd . the average seeing fwhm for the images used in this data set was 1.7  @xmath11 0.2   at kpno and 1.4  @xmath11 0.2  at ctio ; however , the nights with the best seeing conditions were preferentially devoted to the more distant clusters .",
    "the majority of the data presented here were taken in good photometric conditions , for which the photometric zero point calibration could be determined with an accuracy of 0.02 mag or better . in a minority of cases ( 2% ) ,",
    "photometric conditions were of inferior quality . in those cases frames",
    "were taken with a substantial sky overlap with images taken in good photometric conditions , so that fluxes of at least 12 field stars could be measured in the overlap region , thus guaranteeing calibration to the  0.03 mag level .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 band fluxes follows from data reduction methods discussed in paper i and haynes , in preparation , using both standard and customized iraf packages .",
    "we will only mention here that the measured fluxes , denoted @xmath12 , include extrapolations of the exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles to infinity and are typically accurate to  0.03 mag ( uncertainties at least this large are later included after corrections for internal extinction are made ; see paper i for details on flux errors ) .",
    "we apply several corrections to @xmath12 , to obtain : m_cor = m _ - a_i + k_i - m_int - m_t .",
    "the first correction , @xmath13 , is for the extinction caused by the milky way .",
    "we use burstein and heiles ( 1978 ) tabulation of galactic extinction values by averaging entries in the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _",
    "( de vaucouleurs  1991 ) found near the cluster centers .",
    "we convert @xmath14 band results to @xmath1 band via @xmath13 = 0.45@xmath15 ; values of @xmath13 for the nine clusters presented here range from 0.00 to 0.17 mag .",
    "the internal extinction correction , @xmath16 , is applied using the procedure outlined in g97a , m_int = - f(t ) ( w_cor ) ( 1-e ) , where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 1.0 ) depends on the corrected velocity width @xmath19 ( sec . 2.2 ) and @xmath20 is the ellipticity of the spiral disk , corrected for atmospheric seeing effects as described in sec .",
    "5 of paper i ( the adopted correction @xmath16 is slightly smaller for early , less dusty galaxies : @xmath21=0.85 for types @xmath22 earlier than sbc ; @xmath21=1 otherwise ) .",
    "we apply a cosmological k - correction : @xmath23 ( han 1992 ) .",
    "finally , we include a small correction , @xmath24 , for the tf dependence on morphological type found in g97b ; while the true , unextincted , face  on apparent magnitude of the galaxy is @xmath25 represents the value to be used in tf work with the template tf relation obtained in g97b , characterized for sbc and sc galaxies .",
    "thus @xmath26 for types sbc and later ; the correction is 0.1 mag for sb types and 0.32 mag for types earlier than sb .",
    "rotational velocity widths for this sample of cluster galaxies were extracted from long  slit spectra obtained at the palomar observatory 5 m telescope and the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "the clusters a114 , a119 , a194 , a2295 , a3744 , and a2457 were observed at palomar during the runs of october 2223 1995 , december 1318 1995 , july 912 1996 , and september 1319 1996 .",
    "the clusters a2806 , a3193 , and a3381 were observed at ctio during the nights of april 47 1996 and september 30october 3 1996 .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for details of the spectroscopy performed at palomar . the observing setup at the ctio 4 m uses the r ",
    "c spectrograph and the loral 3k ccd with a 203  long slit . the combination of the 1200 lines mm@xmath8 grating and a 2  wide slit yields a dispersion of 0.55   pixel@xmath8 and a spectral resolution of 1.7    ( equivalent to 75  at 6800  ) . along the cross  dispersion axis , the spatial scale is 0.50  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the wavelength range (  5640   to 7320  ) is large enough to observe redshifted  emission in galaxies with recessional velocities up to  34,000 , in our chosen setup .",
    "the adopted observing strategy includes a five minute preliminary integration on each galaxy .",
    "this allows a quick estimate of the spectral lines strength from which we determine the exposure time necessary to adequately sample the outer disk regions .",
    "moreover , performing a five minute test exposure informs us if the galaxy is at the cluster redshift and if the distribution of  regions is sufficient to provide a useful rotation curve .",
    "if the observation is deemed useful , a second integration of usually 1545 minutes is taken .",
    "we extract optical rotation curves ( orcs ) as discussed in paper i. we use the  ( 6563  ) emission line in mapping out the orc except in 2% of the cases where the emission of the  ( 6584  ) line extends to larger radii than that of the  emission .",
    "we kinematically center the orc by assigning the velocity nearest the average of the 10% and 90% velocities to be at radius zero , where an n% velocity is such that n% of the data points in the rotation curve have velocity smaller than it .",
    "besides representing the velocity at the spatial center of the galaxy , we also assume the velocity of the orc at this radius to be the galaxy s recessional velocity .",
    "we define the observed rotational velocity width to be  @xmath27 . in regions",
    "where heavy  absorption and emission are mixed , usually near the galactic center , we fill in the portions of the rotation curve with data from the  rotation curve , if available .",
    "we do this to provide information on the shape of the inner portions of all orcs and to ensure that our method of computing  does not artificially yield slightly large values when data is missing .",
    "we apply this  patch to approximately 10% of the  orcs ; the notes on individual galaxies in sec .",
    "3 indicates which orcs include  patches . in fig .",
    "1 we display the effect a  patch can have on a orc using the orc of galaxy 400641 in abell 119 as an example .",
    "the upper panel gives the  orc without the  patch , the lower panel includes the patch .",
    "the effect on the inferred redshift and  is small , but the shape of the orc has changed significantly .",
    "this change is in part due to the kinematical recentering of the orc  the origin of the orc has also been shifted radially ( by 0.94 ) .",
    "if information on the central portions of an orc is lacking for all spectral lines available , we consider the peak of the galactic continuum light profile , formed by summing the data along the dispersion direction , to represent the spatial center of the galaxy ( see , for example , the upper panel of fig .",
    "the method described above on characterizing rotational velocity widths is used since it effectively ignores small  scale velocity irregularities within an orc that may arise from streaming motions within the galactic disk , the non  uniform distribution of  regions , or distortions associated with the spiral pattern .",
    "furthermore , we find empirically that provided that the rotation curve extends far enough out into the disk , this method recovers the velocity width at , the distance along the major axis to the isophote containing 83% of the @xmath1 band flux .",
    "this radius is reported by persic & salucci ( 1991 & 1995 ) to be a useful radius at which to measure the velocity width of orcs .",
    "thus , extrapolations to the orc , and hence adjustments to , are made in cases where the orc s radial extent falls well short of . the resulting correction which depends on",
    "the shape of the rotation curve , @xmath28 , rarely exceeds 0.1 .    to recover the actual velocity widths , two more corrections are necessary .",
    "the first is the factor 1/sin@xmath29 necessary to convert the width observed for a disk inclined to the line of sight at an angle @xmath29 to what would be observed if the disk were edge  on , and the second is the factor 1/(1+@xmath2 ) to correct for the cosmological broadening of @xmath30 .",
    "the corrected optical rotational velocity width is then w_cor = w_obs + _ sh .",
    "a discussion of the errors in the velocity widths can be found in paper i.    in addition to the  orcs presented here , we also have 21 cm measurements for eight galaxies , all members of abell 194 .",
    "six of the eight  spectra were taken at the arecibo observatory using a spectrometer channel separation of 8 while the remaining two were obtained at the greenbank 300 telescope ( haynes & giovanelli 1991 ) at a spectral resolution of 11 . a typical signal to",
    "noise ratio for these observations was 10 ; errors in the observed velocity widths are of order 15 .",
    "details on the  data reduction and the corrections made to the observed velocity widths can be found in g97a .",
