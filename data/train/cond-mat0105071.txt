    "it is tempting to regard the behavior of granular materials as being a problem in engineering or applied science , inasmuch as the fundamental laws governing their constituent particles are well known . being comprised of macroscopically large grains , granular materials obey classical mechanics , although the existence of friction and inelastic collisions complicates matters .",
    "however , while it is true that the collision of two grains is analytically tractable , an aggregate of such grains is a many - body system , whose macroscopic behavior can not be simply related to the laws controlling individual constituents .    for this reason ,",
    "a continuum treatment is often adopted , in which the variables are averaged properties whose governing equations are derivable , in principle , from the known microscopic laws . among these averaged variables",
    "are the density @xmath5 and the stresses @xmath6 , which obey the cauchy equations that enforce momentum conservation ( or force balance if there are no accelerations ) . however , this set of equations is insufficient to solve for the stresses , since there are too few equations : in @xmath7 dimensions , there are @xmath8 independent components of @xmath6 ( which is a symmetric tensor ) , but only @xmath7 equations of momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , the cauchy equations must be augmented by additional constitutive relations , possibly history - dependent , which tell how the material in question responds to the application of a force .",
    "it is in these constitutive relations that the specifics of the material in question come into play . in the case of steady state flow , which we will consider in this paper ,",
    "constitutive equations would relate the strain - rate , @xmath9 , to the stress .    in 1954 ,",
    "bagnold @xcite proposed that in inertial granular flow , the shear stress is proportional to the square of the strain - rate : @xmath10 his argument , applied to the case of bulk granular flow , is predicated on a constant density profile . in practice , the presence of significant finite - size or wall effects often obscures bagnold scaling . in this study , we report a set of numerical simulations of bulk granular flow down an inclined plane , so - called `` chute flow '' , in two and three dimensions .",
    "the geometry is simple : a layer of bulk granular material is placed on a flat plane of area @xmath11 ( or line of length @xmath12 in 2d ) on which grains have been glued , so as to form a rough base .",
    "the thickness of the layer is measured in terms of the pile height parameter @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 in 2d ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total number of particles and their diameter , respectively .",
    "the plane is inclined at an angle @xmath17 and the flow is observed .",
    "the parameters controlling the flow are the macroscopic variables @xmath17 and @xmath2 , as well as the microscopic variables determining the nature of interaction between two grains , such as grain friction @xmath18 and coefficient of restitution @xmath19 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provided a summary of our simulations in two and three dimensions ; in this paper we expand on these results both in depth and breadth for the case of steady state flow .",
    "the results obtained reveal the rich and surprising nature of the collective behavior of the system . for certain values of the parameters ,",
    "we observe bagnold scaling in stable steady state flow , with a constant density profile independent of depth .",
    "however , we also saw surprising examples of self - organization , including the flow - induced crystallization of a disordered state into one with much lower dissipation . in this regime ( systems flowing on moderately smooth bottom surfaces ) , we found reentrant disordering as well , and even oscillations between ordered and disordered states .",
    "the effects of bottom surfaces are thoroughly discussed in a separate work @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on rough bottom surfaces for which the behavior is simpler .",
    "these simulations also allow us to investigate more subtle aspects of chute flow , such as hysteresis in the angle of repose and normal stress inequalities not accounted for by any conventional continuum theory .",
    "additionally , we were able to look for surface and bulk instabilities to flow at the angle of repose .",
    "in particular , we find that although the bagnold rheology of flow near the angle of repose is a bulk rheology , the fundamental instability inducing the flow in three dimensions appears to be an instability of the surface layers of the granular medium .",
    "because granular materials are so common in nature , existing on many different length scales , there is a great amount of experimental data on a wide range of dynamic situations ; shear flow and vibration experiments @xcite , and studies of geological debris flows @xcite , to name just a few @xcite . there have been several moderately well - characterized experimental studies of granular flow down an inclined plane under laboratory conditions @xcite . yet for all the intense activity in this field over the years , the rheology of granular systems still remains a largely unsolved problem .",
    "there has been some work on continuum modeling of chute flow ; for a review of continuum based ideas see savage @xcite and references therein .",
    "other theoretical analyses ( sometimes combined with case - specific simulation verification ) , specifically applied to chute flow geometries , attempt to calculate density and velocity profiles @xcite , but a general consensus on the qualitative features of these profiles has yet to be reached .",
    "the state of the art of computer simulations of chute flow is much less satisfactory because of the enormous equilibration times needed to set up steady flow . in three dimensions ,",
    "simulations have been performed for rather thin piles , which provides insight into only a small region of phase space @xcite .",
    "simulations of two - dimensional flows also report on small systems , and it is unclear whether these studies are carried out in the steady state regime or whether the data reported are transient @xcite .",
    "the basics behind granular simulations are available in refs .",
    "@xcite for 2d and @xcite for 3d .",
    "our simulations attempt a systematic 3d study of chute flows .",
    "unfortunately , we probe regions of phase space difficult to access in experiment . in a typical 3d experiment",
    "the flow is induced through a hopper - feeder mechanism which controls the flow rate of the system , but not the thickness of the flowing sample , which is chosen spontaneously by the system .",
    "thus , much experimental data is for flowing piles 10 - 15 particles high , whereas most of our simulations focus on moderate to thick piles , greater than 30 particles .",
    "simulation results for systems smaller than 10 - 15 particles high do not show the same scaling as that for thicker systems @xcite . also , 3d experiments are usually carried out in narrow channels of order 10 particles wide or less , where side - wall effects may have a significant role in the observed behavior .",
    "our simulations are periodic in this , the vorticity , direction , and we have yet to study wall effects .",
    "we suspect that most discrepancies that may exist between different experimental and simulation studies are due to such differences in the detailed nature of the systems studied .    because of the complexity of flowing granular systems ,",
    "it is useful to first define the region of study . in order to determine the phase boundaries of fully developed , steady state flow ,",
    "we have performed a series of simulations of inclined plane gravity driven flows in two and three dimensions in an attempt to define the region of phase space for which steady state flows exist .",
    "a typical configuration snapshot in 3d , defining the computational geometry , is shown in fig .",

    "flow is directed down the incline.__,width=278 ]    in our simulations , initiation of flow is achieved by tilting at a large angle ( @xmath22 ) to induce flow .",
    "this procedure removes any configuration construction history effects .",
    "we then reduce the inclination to a lower angle and allow the simulation to run until we observe a steady state flow regime ( if one exists ) .",
    "we define steady state as flow wherein the energy input from gravity balances that dissipated from friction and collisions ; so that the total kinetic energy of the system reaches a macroscopically constant value . in this case , the results are independent of sample history .    in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , we draw phase boundaries for both two and three dimensional flows as a function of the external control parameters : tilt angle @xmath17 and pile height @xmath2 .",
    "this should be compared to a similar experimental determination recently obtained by pouliquen @xcite .",
    "the salient features are the existence in both 2d and 3d of three principal regions , corresponding to _ no flow _",
    ", _ stable flow _ , and _ unstable flow_. for a system of given thickness and fixed microscopic interaction parameters , these three regions are separated by two angles : @xmath23 , the angle of repose , and @xmath24 , the _ maximum stability angle _ , the largest angle for which stable flow is obtained , shown by a solid and dashed lines in fig .",

    "both figures are for the spring dash - pot interaction model with rough bottom surface .",
    "solid circles indicate region of steady state flow , open symbols correspond to no flow or unstable flow .",

    "both figures are for the spring dash - pot interaction model with rough bottom surface .",

    "the region of constant packing fraction in the flowing material for steady state systems is accompanied by a smoothly varying , non - linear velocity profile . for @xmath28 , the development of a shear thinning layer at the bottom of the pile results in lift - off and unstable acceleration of the entire pile .",
    "the exact locations of these phase boundaries depend on the model parameters such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , in 2d , if @xmath19 is reduced from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , the maximum angle of steady - state flow increases from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , reducing @xmath18 typically reduces the range of stable flow .",
    "it is well known that granular systems exhibit hysteresis .",
    "such behavior is usually attributed to system preparation and associated history effects @xcite .",
    "although we observe three distinct regimes , the behavior close to the phase boundaries is sensitive to the procedure for the initiation of flow .",
    "indeed , we have observed hysteresis in our 3d simulations when approaching @xmath33 from either side , particularly for thinner piles .",
    "the hysteresis was significantly reduced upon increasing pile height @xmath2 .",
    "crystallization of the 2d monodisperse pile upon the arrest of flow was primarily responsible for the large hysteresis observed in that case .",
    "besides the phase diagram , our most important results concern the detailed structure and rheology of the steady - state flowing regime . in this regime , we do see a constant density profile with height , as well as the bagnold scaling of eq.([eqbagnold ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the strain rate goes to zero at the angle of repose ; thus relations such as eq.([eqbagnold ] ) possess an additional strong angular dependence .",
    "we also analyzed the normal stresses in the flowing state , and found a number of results , most notably that the normal stress perpendicular to the free surface , @xmath34 , is approximately , but not exactly , equal to the normal stress parallel to the flow , @xmath35 .",
    "there are two fundamental puzzles in these results for the rheology of chute flow .",
    "the first , and smaller , puzzle is the appearance of an anomalous normal stress difference @xmath36 . we have been unable to define a simple , local , dimensionally consistent and rotationally invariant constitutive relation connecting @xmath37 to @xmath38 that recovers this behavior .    the second , and deeper puzzle , is the relationship between the rheology and the coulomb yield criterion . as the angle of repose",
    "is approached from above , the amplitude of the flow goes to zero , but the tensor structure of @xmath37 remains approximately liquid - like , instead of recovering the large normal stress difference characteristic of the coulomb yield criterion , which presumably applies to the static pile at the angle of repose .",
    "the one exception to this observation is the surface stress in three dimensions , where the normal stress differences do become large as the angle of repose is approached , suggesting that surface yield may control the failure of the static state .    in the bulk , however , we are left with a transition to a static state that appears continuous in shear rate , but is apparently discontinuous in normal stress .",
    "we do not believe that an understanding of chute flow rheology is possible without resolving this seeming paradox .",
    "we present the simulation scheme in section [ simmed ] , detailing the inter - particle force laws .",
    "in section [ results ] , we report our comprehensive simulation analysis , including the behavior of the density and velocity profiles for our systems with varying interaction parameters . in section [ secstress ]",
    ", we present a detailed discussion of stress analysis and rheology of chute flow systems . in section [ secconc ]",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "we use the methods of molecular dynamics to perform 2d and 3d simulations of granular particles . for this study we model @xmath15 mono - disperse spheres of diameter @xmath16 and mass @xmath39 , supported on the @xmath40-plane by a rough bed .",
    "the computational geometry of the present 3d system consists of a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath41 ( flow)- and @xmath42 ( vorticity)-directions and constrained in the vertical @xmath0-direction by a fixed rough , bottom wall and a free top surface , as in fig .",
    "[ config_3d ] .",
    "simulations in periodic cells attempt to study flow down infinitely long and wide chutes , while using a finite number of particles .    in 3d , the fixed bottom is constructed from a random conformation of spheres of the same diameter @xmath16 as those in the bulk by taking a slice with areal fraction very close to random close packing ( approximately 1.2 particle diameters thick ) , from a previously packed state .",
    "this simulates an experimental procedure whereby glue is spread over the original smooth chute surface and particles are then sprinkled onto this surface to construct a rough floor approximately one particle layer thick . for 2d studies ,",
    "the bottom wall is constructed from a regular array of spheres of diameter @xmath43 and particle motion is restricted to the @xmath44-plane .",
    "we employed a contact force model that captures the major features of granular interactions . in 2d ,",
    "interactions between ( projected ) spheres are modeled using a linear spring model with velocity - dependent damping ( the spring - dashpot interaction ) and _ static friction_. in 3d the spring - dashpot model and static friction are also used , as well as hertzian contact forces with static friction . in the presentation of the results , we will specify which model is employed , and discuss the differences .",
    "the implementation of the contact forces , both the normal forces and the shear ( friction ) tangential forces , is essentially a reduced version of that employed by walton and braun @xcite , developed earlier by cundall and strack @xcite .",
    "more recent versions of these models now exist @xcite .",
    "we ignore hysteretic effects between loading or unloading normal contacts and we do not differentiate between frictional directions at the same contact point at different time - steps as does walton@xcite .",
