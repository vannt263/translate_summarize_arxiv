    "the question of robustness of a basis or frame is a fundamental problem in functional analysis and in many concrete applications .",
    "it has its historical origin in the work of paley and wiener  @xcite who studied the perturbation of fourier bases and was subsequently investigated in many contexts in complex analysis and harmonic analysis . particularly fruitful was the study of the robustness of structured function systems , such as reproducing kernels , sets of sampling in a space of analytic functions , wavelets , or gabor systems . in this paper",
    "we take a new look at the stability of gabor frames and gabor riesz sequences with respect to general deformations of phase space .",
    "to be explicit , let us denote the time - frequency shift  of a function @xmath0 along @xmath1 by @xmath2 for a fixed non - zero function @xmath3 , usually called a `` window function '' , and @xmath4 , a gabor system is a structured function system of the form @xmath5 the index set @xmath6 is a discrete subset of the phase space @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicates the localization of a time - frequency shift  @xmath9 in phase space .",
    "the gabor system @xmath10 is called a _ frame _ ( a gabor frame ) , if @xmath11 for some constants @xmath12 . in this case",
    "every function @xmath13 possesses an expansion @xmath14 , for some coefficient sequence @xmath15 such that @xmath16 . the gabor system @xmath10 is called a _ riesz sequence _ ( or riesz basis for its span ) , if @xmath17 for all @xmath15 .    for meaningful statements about gabor frames it is usually assumed",
    "that @xmath18 this condition describes the modulation space  @xmath19 , also known as the feichtinger algebra .",
    "every schwartz function satisfies this condition .    in this paper",
    "we study the stability of the spanning properties of @xmath10 with respect to a set @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is `` close enough '' to @xmath6 , then we expect @xmath22 to possess the same spanning properties . in this context",
    "we distinguish perturbations and deformations . whereas a perturbation is local and @xmath21 is obtained by slightly moving every @xmath23 , a deformation is a global transformation of @xmath7 .",
    "the existing literature is rich in perturbation results , but not much is known about deformations of gabor frames .",
    "\\(a ) _ perturbation or jitter error : _ the jitter describes small pointwise perturbations of @xmath6 . for every gabor frame @xmath24 with @xmath25",
    "there exists a maximal jitter @xmath26 with the following property : if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , then @xmath29 is also a frame .",
    "see  @xcite for a general result in coorbit theory , the recent paper  @xcite , and christensen s book on frames  @xcite for more details and references .",
    "conceptually the jitter error is easy to understand , because the frame operator is continuous in the operator norm with respect to the jitter error .",
    "the proof techniques go back to paley and wiener  @xcite and amount to norm estimates for the frame operator .",
    "\\(b ) _ linear deformations : _ the fundamental deformation result is due to feichtinger and kaiblinger  @xcite . let @xmath30 , @xmath20 be a lattice , and assume that @xmath24 is a frame for @xmath31 .",
    "then there exists @xmath26 with the following property : if @xmath32 is a @xmath33-matrix with @xmath34 ( in some given matrix norm ) , then @xmath35 is again a frame .",
    "only recently , this result was generalized to non - uniform gabor frames  @xcite .",
    "the proof for the case of a lattice  @xcite was based on the duality theory of gabor frames , the proof for non - uniform gabor frames in  @xcite relies on the stability under chirps of the sjstrand symbol class for pseudodifferential operators , but this technique does not seem to adapt to nonlinear deformations . compared to perturbations , ( linear ) deformations of gabor frames are much more difficult to understand , because the frame operator no longer depends ( norm- ) continuously on @xmath6 and a deformation may change the density of @xmath6 ( which may affect significantly the spanning properties of @xmath36 ) .",
    "perhaps the main difficulty is to find a suitable notion for deformations that preserves gabor frames .",
    "except for linear deformations and some preliminary observations in  @xcite this question is simply unexplored . in this paper",
    "we introduce a general concept of deformation , which we call _ lipschitz _ deformations .",
    "lipschitz deformations include both the jitter error and linear deformations as a special case .",
    "the precise definition is somewhat technical and will be given in section  6 . for simplicity",
    "we formulate a representative special case of our main result .",
    "[ th_main_intro ] let @xmath37 and @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath38 for @xmath39 be a sequence of differentiable maps with jacobian @xmath40 .",
    "assume that @xmath41    then the following holds .",
    "* if @xmath10 is a frame , then @xmath42 is a frame for all sufficiently large @xmath43 . *",
    "if @xmath10 is a riesz sequence , then @xmath44 is a riesz sequence for all sufficiently large @xmath43 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that theorem  [ th_main_intro ] is quite general .",
    "it deals with _ non - uniform _ gabor frames ( not just lattices ) under _ nonlinear _ deformations .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ th_main_intro ] implies the main results of  @xcite .",
    "the counterpart for deformations of gabor riesz sequences ( item ( b ) ) is new even for linear deformations .    condition   roughly states that the mutual distances between the points of @xmath45 are preserved locally under the deformation @xmath46 .",
    "our main insight was that the frame property of a deformed gabor system @xmath47 does not depend so much on the position or velocity of the sequences @xmath48 for @xmath23 , but on the relative distances @xmath49 for @xmath50 . for an illustration see example  [ ex_go_wrong ] .",
    "as an application of theorem  [ th_main_intro ] , we derive a _ non - uniform balian - low theorem _ ( blt ) .",
    "for this , we recall that the lower beurling density of a set @xmath20 is given by @xmath51 and likewise the upper beurling density @xmath52 ( where the minimum is replaced by a supremum ) .",
    "the fundamental density theorem of ramanathan and steger  @xcite asserts that if @xmath24 is a frame then @xmath53 .",
    "analogously , if @xmath24 is a riesz sequence , then @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the so - called balian - low theorem ( blt ) is a stronger version of the density theorem and asserts that for `` nice '' windows @xmath55 the inequalities in the density theorem are strict . for the case",
    "when @xmath30 and @xmath6 is a lattice , the balian - low theorem is a consequence of  @xcite .",
    "a balian - low theorem for non - uniform gabor frames was open for a long time and was proved only recently by ascensi , feichtinger , and kaiblinger  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding statement for gabor riesz sequences was open and is settled here as an application of our deformation theorem .",
    "we refer to heil s detailed survey  @xcite of the numerous contributions to the density theorem for gabor frames after  @xcite and to  @xcite for the balian - low theorem .    as an immediate consequence of theorem  [ th_main_intro ] we obtain the following version of the balian - low theorem for non - uniform gabor systems .",
    "assume that @xmath30 .",
    "\\(a ) if @xmath24 is a frame for @xmath31 , then @xmath56 .",
    "\\(b ) if @xmath24 is a riesz sequence in @xmath31 , then @xmath57 .",
    "we only prove the new statement ( b ) , part ( a ) is similar  @xcite .",
    "assume @xmath24 is a riesz sequence , but that @xmath58",
    ". let @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and set @xmath61 .",
    "then the sequence @xmath46 satisfies condition . on the one hand",
    ", we have @xmath62 , and on the other hand , theorem  [ th_main_intro ] implies that @xmath63 is a riesz sequence for @xmath43 large enough .",
    "this is a contradiction to the density theorem , and thus the assumption @xmath58 can not hold .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th_main_intro ] does not come easily and is technical .",
    "it combines methods from the theory of localized frames  @xcite , the stability of operators on @xmath64-spaces  @xcite and weak limit techniques in the style of beurling  @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath65 is a weak limit of translates of @xmath66 , if there exists a sequence @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 uniformly on compact sets .",
    "see section  4 for the precise definition and more details on weak limits .    we will prove the following characterization of non - uniform gabor frames `` without inequalities '' .",
    "[ th - char - frame ] assume that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a frame for @xmath31 , if and only if  for every weak limit @xmath71 of @xmath6 the map @xmath72 is one - to - one on @xmath73 .",
    "the full statement with five equivalent conditions characterizing a non - uniform gabor frame will be given in section  5 , theorem  [ th_char_frame ] .",
    "an analogous characterization of gabor riesz sequences with weak limits is stated in theorem  [ th_char_riesz ] .    for the special case when @xmath6 is a lattice , the above characterization of gabor frames without inequalities was already proved in  @xcite .",
    "in the lattice case , the gabor system @xmath24 possesses additional invariance properties that facilitate the application of methods from operator algebras .",
    "the generalization of @xcite to non - uniform gabor systems was rather surprising for us and demands completely different methods .",
    "to make theorem  [ th - char - frame ] more plausible , we make the analogy with beurling s results on balayage in paley - wiener space .",
    "beurling  @xcite characterized the stability of sampling in the paley - wiener space of bandlimited functions @xmath74 for a compact spectrum @xmath75 in terms of sets of uniqueness for this space .",
    "it is well - known that the frame property of a gabor system @xmath76 is equivalent to a sampling theorem for an associated transform .",
    "precisely , let @xmath77 be the short - time fourier transform , for fixed non - zero @xmath25 and @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a frame , if and only if   @xmath6 is a set of sampling for the short - time fourier transform  on @xmath79 . in this light",
    ", theorem  [ th - char - frame ] is the precise analog of beurling s theorem for bandlimited functions .",
    "one may therefore try to adapt beurling s methods to gabor frames and the sampling of short - time fourier transforms .",
    "beurling s ideas have been used for many sampling problems in complex analysis following the pioneering work of seip on the fock space @xcite,@xcite and the bergman space @xcite , see also @xcite for a survey . a remarkable fact in theorem  [ th - char - frame ]",
    "is the absence of a complex structure ( except when @xmath55 is a gaussian ) .",
    "this explains why we have to use the machinery of localized frames and the stability of operators in our proof .",
    "we mention that beurling s ideas have been transferred to a few other contexts outside complex analysis , such as sampling theorems with spherical harmonics in the sphere  @xcite , or , more generally , with eigenvectors of the laplace operator in riemannian manifolds  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  2 we collect the main definitions from time - frequency analysis . in section  3",
    "we discuss time - frequency  molecules and their @xmath64-stability .",
    "section  4 is devoted to the details of beurling s notion of weak convergence of sets . in section  5",
    "we state and prove the full characterization of non - uniform gabor frames and riesz sequences without inequalities . in section  6",
    "we introduce the general concept of a lipschitz deformation of a set and prove the main properties .",
    "finally , in section  7 we state and prove the main result of this paper , the general deformation result .",
    "the appendix provides the technical proof of the stability of time - frequency  molecules .",
    "throughout the article , @xmath80 denotes the euclidean norm , and @xmath81 denotes the euclidean ball . given two functions @xmath82 , we say that @xmath83 if there exists a constant @xmath84 such that @xmath85 , for all @xmath86 .",
