    "<S> it has been shown that quantum fluctuations are enhanced near the orbital degeneracy and could suppress long - range order in the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) model @xcite , called below the @xmath0 model . </S>",
    "<S> this model was introduced long ago for a perovskite kcuf@xmath1 @xcite , a strongly correlated system with a single hole within degenerate @xmath2 orbitals at each cu@xmath3 ion . </S>",
    "<S> kugel and khomskii showed that orbital order can be stabilized by a purely electronic superexchange mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for strongly frustrated orbital superexchange @xcite , and columnar ising - type of order is obtained @xcite in the two - dimensional quantum compass model . </S>",
    "<S> this model exhibits nontrivial symmetry properties which may be employed to perform efficient calculations for square compass clusters @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> orbital order occurs in a number of compounds with active orbital degrees of freedom , where strong coulomb interaction localizes electrons ( or holes ) and gives rise to spin - orbital superexchange @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when spin and orbital pseudospins couple to each other , their order is usually complementary  alternating orbital ( ao ) order accompanies ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin order , and ferro - orbital ( fo ) order coexists with antiferromagetic ( af ) spin order . </S>",
    "<S> however , the above goodenough - kanamori rules , see also @xcite , are not satisfied in cases when spin - orbital entanglement ( soe ) dominates @xcite , as for instance in the spin - orbital @xmath4 model on a triangular lattice @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbital superexchange kk model for cu@xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) ions in kcuf@xmath1 with @xmath5 spins and @xmath2 orbitals descibed by @xmath6 pseudospin was derived from the degenerate hubbard hamiltonian with hopping @xmath7 , intraorbital coulomb interaction @xmath8 and hund s exchange @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the heisenberg su(2 ) spin interactions coupled to the orbital problem by superexchange @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 depend on @xmath13 @xcite , and @xmath14 is the bond direction . in a bilayer </S>",
    "<S> two @xmath15 planes are connected by interlayer bonds along the @xmath16 axis @xcite ( a monolayer has only bonds within a single @xmath15 plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath17 are projection operators on a triplet ( singlet ) configuration on a bond @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the orbital operators for bond direction @xmath14 . they are defined in terms of pauli matrices @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 finally , @xmath22 is the crystal - field splitting which favors either @xmath23 ( if @xmath24 ) or @xmath25 ( if @xmath26 ) orbitals occupied by holes . </S>",
    "<S> thus the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) depends on two parameters : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbital model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) describes also cuo@xmath29 planes in la@xmath29cuo@xmath30 , where indeed @xmath31 and large @xmath32 favors holes within @xmath33 orbitals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superexchange between cu@xmath3 ions @xmath34 ev reproduces there the experimental value . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) for k@xmath1cu@xmath29f@xmath35 bilayer compound where nearly degenerate @xmath2 orbitals are expected . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the magnetic state of k@xmath1cu@xmath29f@xmath35 is described by interlayer valence bond ( vb ) phase stabilized by fo@xmath36 order with @xmath36 orbitals occupied by holes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we show below that the bilayer spin - orbital @xmath0 model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) describes a competition between different types of spin - orbital order . </S>",
    "<S> consider first @xmath37 , where depending on the sign of the crystal field @xmath22 we get either fo@xmath36 or fo@xmath33 configuration with @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> after inserting these values into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) one finds the heisenberg model describing either an af bilayer ( @xmath40 ) or two independent af planes ( @xmath41 ) as in la@xmath29cuo@xmath30 . in the limit of @xmath42 , </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath43 diverges and at large @xmath44 one finds fully fm configuration with ao order .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approach is a single - site mean field ( mf ) approximation applied to the model eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamik ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it excludes any spin fluctuations so the spin projectors @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) can be replaced by their mean values , where the dependence on the bond @xmath18 reduces to direction @xmath47 in phases with translationally invariant magnetic order listed in table  [ sord ] : the @xmath48-af phase , the @xmath49-af phase with af planes and fm interplane bonds , the @xmath50-af phase with fm planes and af interplane bonds and the fm phase .    in the orbital sector </S>",
    "<S> we apply then the mf decoupling for the products @xmath51 along the axis @xmath47 : @xmath52 as order parameters we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 for a chosen site @xmath55 ( which is sufficient in orbital sector as @xmath56 ) and we assume two orbital sublattices : each neighbor of the site @xmath57 is rotated by @xmath58 in the @xmath15 plane meaning that @xmath59 . the self - consistency equations can be solved analytically ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and the phase diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diags](a ) is obtained by comparing the ground state energies for different points in the @xmath60 plane . </S>",
    "<S> one finds two classes of solutions : ( @xmath57 ) uniform orbital configurations ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) for global fo order , and ( @xmath63 ) nontrivial ao order with orbitals staggering from site to site in @xmath15 planes .    </S>",

    "<S> [ diags](a ) : @xmath48-af@xmath36 for @xmath67 and @xmath48-af@xmath33 for @xmath68 , with different fo orders involving @xmath36 or @xmath33 orbitals , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> because of the planar orbital configuration in the latter @xmath48-af phase one finds no interplane spin coupling and thus this phase is degenerate with the @xmath49-af one . for higher </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 the number of phases increases abruptly by three phases , all with ao configurations : the @xmath50-af , @xmath48-af / ao and @xmath49-af / ao phase . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the ao version of the @xmath48-af phase is connected neither to fo@xmath36 nor to fo@xmath33 order in an antiferromagnet , excluding the multicritical point at @xmath69 , and disappears completely for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath49-af / ao phase stays on top of uniform @xmath48(@xmath49)-af phase , lifting their degeneracy at relatively large @xmath28 and then gets replaced by the fm phase which always coexists with ao order , so one can conclude that the @xmath48-af/@xmath49-af degeneracy is most easily lifted by turning on the orbital alternation . on the opposite side ( for @xmath26 ) , the @xmath48-af@xmath36 phase is completely surrounded by @xmath50-af phase with ao order . in the @xmath50-af phase the af correlations in the @xmath16 direction survive despite the overall fm tendency when @xmath28 grows . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the orbitals elongation in the @xmath16 direction which stabilizes interplane singlets in a better cluster mf approach , see below . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the fm phase is favored for any @xmath22 if only @xmath28 is sufficiently close to @xmath71 , as expected .     </S>",
    "<S> bilayer model ( 1 ) obtained in : ( a ) a single - site mf , and ( b ) a cluster mf . in ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> shaded ( green ) area indicates phases with nontrivial ao order while the other ones have fo order . in ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> light shaded ( yellow ) area marks singlet phases with spin disorder and dark ( orange ) shading indicates phases with so entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> , width=8 ]    in a better cluster mf ( or bethe - peierls - weiss ) approach , introduced to capture the effects of quantum fluctuations , one divides the bilayer square lattice into separate cubes containing 8 sites each and treats the bonds inside a cube exactly , and the bonds connecting different cubes in mf . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has at least three advantages over the single - site mf : ( @xmath57 ) spins can fluctuate , ( @xmath63 ) elementary cell can double , and ( @xmath72 ) we can have independent spin - orbital order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the mf leads in a cluster to three order parameters : magnetic @xmath73 , orbital @xmath74 , and on - site soe @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistency equations take rather complicated form ( for details see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and can be solved only numerically by time - consuming iterative lanczos diagonalization of a cluster combined with updating the mfs . in orbital sector apart from the ao order described earlier , we consider configurations where orbitals within a cluster break the symmetry between @xmath76 and @xmath77 directions but the neighboring clusters are rotated by @xmath58 in the @xmath15 plane , so globally the symmetry is preserved and the elementary cell is doubled . in the spin sector we consider the same configurations as in a single - site approach .    , orbital @xmath74 and on - site soe @xmath78 for @xmath79 and for increasing : ( a ) @xmath22 in a bilayer in the eso , epvb and pvb phase , for @xmath80 ; ( b ) @xmath81 in a monolayer in the eso , ao - pm and pm phase , for @xmath82.,width=8 ]    including spin fluctuations in the cluster mf approach stabilizes the @xmath48-af phase with @xmath33 orbitals over the fm one ( @xmath24 ) but suppresses it when @xmath36 orbitals are filled by holes ( @xmath67 ) , and gives instead three singlet vb phases called : pvb ( plaquette vb ) , vb@xmath36 and vb@xmath83 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diags](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> vb@xmath36 phase replaces @xmath48-af@xmath36 phase shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ diags](a ) and involves interplane singlets accompanied by fo@xmath36 configuration . </S>",
    "<S> this phase was observed in k@xmath1cu@xmath29f@xmath35 by manaka _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  here we explain it for realistic @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the vb@xmath83 phase is very similar to vb@xmath36 but with slightly modified fo order by an ao component increasing toward the @xmath50-af phase . </S>",
    "<S> transition from vb@xmath83 to vb@xmath36 is of the second order . in </S>",
    "<S> the pvb phase spin singlets are pointing uniformly in @xmath76 or @xmath77 direction within the cluster and the elementary cell is doubled .    </S>",
    "<S> a different class of phases involves soe  these are the eso , epvb and pvb - af phase . </S>",
    "<S> all of them exhibit soe but only the eso and epvb ones lie in the highly frustrated part of the phase diagram and have large on - site entanglement @xmath78 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ enta](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pvb - af phase connects pvb and @xmath48-af phases by second order phase transitions and is characterized by fast changes in orbital order and appearance of global magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the eso phase has no magnetization and fo order is here much weaker than in the vb@xmath36 phase . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath22 grows , the eso phase does change continuously into the epvb configuration , being an entangled precursor of the pvb phase , with doubling of the unit cell and finite af order which vanishes smoothly approaching the pvb phase . </S>",
    "<S> additional calculations described in @xcite show that these entangled phases are absent if one assumes that @xmath85 factorizes , i.e. , @xmath86 .    using the same cluster mf approach as above one can easily study the phase diagram of the kk model for a single layer at finite temperature @xmath81 . at t = 0 one </S>",
    "<S> finds the af , fm , and pvb phases together with an eso phase between the af and fm phases . </S>",
    "<S> turning on the thermal fluctuations we have found that typically the orbital order is much more robust than the magnetic one and the orbital configuration compatible with lattice geometry can greatly stabilize spin order . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ enta](b ) we present the thermal evolution of the order parameters @xmath87 and on - site soe parameter @xmath78 in the eso phase which melts and ends up as an ordinary paramagnetic ( pm ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> more details and the phase diagrams will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we have shown that spin - orbital entanglement leads to exotic types of order which are stabilized by quantum fluctuations both in bilayer and monolayer systems .. they emerge from highly frustrated spin - orbital superexchange and could be discovered only within a cluster mean field approach . </S>"
