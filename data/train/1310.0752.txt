    "single spin asymmetries(ssa s ) arise in the scattering of transversely polarized nucleons off an unpolarized nucleon ( or virtual photon ) target , when the final state hadrons have asymmetric distribution in the transverse plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "ssa for inclusive process @xmath2 depends on the polarization vector of the scattering hadron a and is defined by @xmath3    non - zero ssas have been observed over the years- in pion production at fermilab@xcite and at rhic@xcite in @xmath4 collisions as well as in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) experiments at hermes@xcite and compass@xcite .",
    "these results have generated a lot of interest amongst theoreticians to investigate the mechanism involved and to understand the underlying physics .",
    "the initial attempts to provide theoretical predictions of asymmetry , based on collinear factorization of pqcd , led to estimates which were too small as compared to the experimental results@xcite . in collinear",
    "factorization formalism , the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) and fragmentation functions ( ff s ) are integrated over intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons and hence depend only on longitudinal momentum fraction x. the observation that ssas calculated within collinear formalism were almost vanishing suggested that these asymmetries may be due to parton s transverse motion and spin orbit correlation .",
    "a generalization of factorization theorem , in the form of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization which includes the transverse momentum dependence of pdf s and ff s , was proposed as a possible approach to account for the asymmetries@xcite .",
    "one of the tmd pdf s of interest is sivers function , which gives the probability of finding an unpolarized quark inside a transversely polarized proton .",
    "the sivers function , @xmath5 , defined by @xmath6 is related to the number density of partons inside a proton with transverse polarization s , three momentum @xmath7 and intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath8 of partons , and its spin dependence is given by @xmath9    parametrizations of quark sivers distributions have been obtained from fits of ssa in sidis experiments@xcite .",
    "however , not much information is available on gluon sivers function .",
    "processes that have been studied with the aim of getting information about this tmd are back to back correlations in azimuthal angles of of jet produced in @xmath10 scattering@xcite and d meson production in @xmath10 scattering@xcite .",
    "heavy quark and quarkonium systems have also been proposed as natural probes to study gluon sivers function due to the fact that the production is sensitive to intrinsic transverse momentum especially at low momentum@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested , in the context of deep inelastic scattering@xcite that the initial and final state interactions may lead to non - vanishing ssas .",
    "single transverse spin asymmetry in heavy quarkonium production in lepton - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon collisions has been investigated by yuan _ etal _ taking into account the initial and final state interactions @xcite and it has been shown that the asymmetry is very sensitive to the production mechanism .",
    "the three main models of heavy quarkonium production , which have been proposed and tested in unpolarized scattering , are color singlet model@xcite , color evaporation model ( cem)@xcite and the nrqcd factorization approach@xcite .",
    "it was argued in ref.@xcite that the asymmetry should be non - zero in ep collisions only in color - octet model and in pp collisions only in color - singlet model .",
    "thus , ssa in charmonium production can be used to throw some light on the issue of production mechanism . in this work ,",
    "we present estimates of ssa in the process @xmath11 and compare the results obtained using tmd evolution of pdf s with our earlier results which were obtained using dglap evolution only .",
    "the first estimate of ssa in photoproduction ( i.e. low virtuality electroproduction ) of @xmath12 in the scattering of electrons off transversely polarized protons were provided by us in ref.@xcite using color evaporation model . in the process under consideration , at lo",
    ", there is contribution only from a single partonic subprocess and therefore , it can be used as a clean probe of gluon sivers function .    color evaporation model ( cem ) was introduced in 1977 by fritsch and was revived in 1996 by halzen@xcite .",
    "this model gives a good description of photoproduction data after inclusion of higher order qcd corrections@xcite and also of the hadroproduction cdf data @xcite after inclusion of @xmath13 smearing .",
    "in cem , the cross - section for a quarkonium state h is some fraction @xmath14 of the cross - section for producing @xmath15 pair with invariant mass below the @xmath16 threshold , where m is the lowest mass meson containing the heavy quark q : @xmath17=f_h\\sum_{i , j}\\int_{4m^2}^{4m_m^2 }   d\\hat{s }   \\nonumber \\\\",
