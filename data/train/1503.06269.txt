    "the investigation of the elemental abundance traces the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "the chemical history of the galaxy is dominated by the processes of nucleosynthesis in each generation of stars .",
    "based on the observational behaviors of elemental abundances in stars with different metallicities , one can not only look back the galactic chemical enrichment history , but also constrain the theoretical evolutionary models of our galaxy .",
    "copper is of particular interest among the iron - peak elements , because firstly it has unique evolutionary trend as the [ fe / h ] varies from extremely metal - poor to the solar abundance , and secondly this element is thought to be synthesized by several possible nucleosynthesis scenarios , yet the contributions of these scenarios are still in dispute .    from the observational point of view , although it was @xcite who gave the early glance at the galactic copper abundances ( they investigated @xmath9 red giants in @xmath10 globular clusters ) , and who first suggested a decreasing trend of [ cu / fe ] with decreasing [ fe / h ] , the evolutionary trend of [ cu / fe ] was not established firmly until @xcite . in a series of work @xcite , the authors derived the copper abundances for a large sample of stars in the galactic disk and halo .",
    "their results clearly showed a linear trend of [ cu / fe ] , which increases towards the higher metallicity .",
    "this trend was partly confirmed by @xcite and @xcite , the former authors investigated an expanded sample of disk and halo stars with wide range metallicity , while the latter ones managed to measure the copper abundances for @xmath11 giants in @xmath12 globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , both work indicated a flat plateau of [ cu / fe ] at the metal - poor end , which is roughly [ cu / fe ] @xmath13 at [ fe / h ] @xmath14 .",
    "some contemporaneous studies on single ultra - metal - poor stars seemed consistent with this flat distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , using the near - uv lines , @xcite and @xcite suggested the plateau should be around @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite investigated a large sample of disk stars , and they found little variation of [ cu / fe ] with [ fe / h ] in the metallicity range [ fe / h ] @xmath17 , where the values of [ cu / fe ] show no evident divergence with respect to the solar copper abundance .",
    "thus , a slight s - shape of [ cu / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] can be seen by overlapping the data from different authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) . although the stars investigated by a great quantity of work followed the galactic general s - shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several peculiar structures were still detected , such as ursa major moving group ( umag ) @xcite , omega centauri ( @xmath18 cen ) @xcite , sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) @xcite , and the halo sub - population @xcite .",
    "their discordant trends of [ cu / fe ] may imply different chemical evolutionary histories with respect to our milky way .    theoretically , copper is thought to be produced in multiple astrophysical sites .",
    "the first one is the weak @xmath19process which takes place in massive stars during the helium- and carbon - shell burning stage @xcite .",
    "it is a secondary process that needs iron seeds from previous generations of stars , resulting in the linear dependence of [ cu / fe ] on [ fe / h ] .",
    "@xcite proposed a revised version of this scenario , suggesting @xmath20process dominated copper synthesis in massive stars instead of classical @xmath19process .",
    "additionally , simulations of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) by @xcite and @xcite also support that massive stars contribute most of copper .",
    "however , @xcite showed the second possibility by fitting gce models to interpret observational data .",
    "they suggested that the main source of copper was type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) instead of @xmath19process ( but they needed to increase the yields from sne ia by about an order of magnitude ) .",
    "this conclusion was subsequently supported by the work from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the third mechanism comes from the constraint of the [ cu / fe ] plateau at low metallicity , which requires the contributions from primary explosive nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the productions calculated from sne ii are model - dependent @xcite , resulting in discordant predicted fractions . besides",
    ", large scatters in observational results also play a relevant role ( see the examples given by * ? ? ?",
    "the last source was the main @xmath19process operating in the low- and intermediate - mass agb stars , which was thought to contribute only about @xmath21 of the solar copper @xcite .",
    "so far , a number of analyses on copper abundance have been presented , covering the whole range of metallicity , from solar to the most extreme metal - poor stars , but none of them is carried out with the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) calculations .",
    "this is partly because non - lte calculations need reliable atomic model and detailed statistical equilibrium calculations , whereas neither of them is a simple job for copper . despite the difficulties , there are at least two principal reasons that we have to put non - lte analysis into perspective",
    "first , recent studies on non - lte effects have demonstrated that the non - lte correction is large for some elements in metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , only a few lines can be used to perform copper abundance analysis when dealing with the metal - poor stars with relatively higher temperature , as there is little neutral copper in the atmospheres of such stars .",
    "the analysis has to rely on the two resonance lines at @xmath22  and @xmath23 , both of which may suffer large non - lte effects @xcite . @xcite and @xcite also reported that the abundances derived from these two lines are inconsistent with those derived from other optical lines .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at exploring the copper abundances for the sample stars in the metallicity range @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath25 with a complete spectrum synthesis method based on level population calculated from the statistical equilibrium equations . in section 2",
    ", we will briefly introduce some key information about the observations .",
    "the fundamental work for abundance analysis , i.e. , atmospheric model , stellar parameters , and atomic line data are presented in section 3 .",
    "the 4th section will provide details of non - lte calculations including the atomic model .",
    "in section 5 we will show the final results and error analysis .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are presented in section 6 and section 7 , respectively .",
    "the sample stars investigated in this paper have already been discussed by @xcite . here , we simply list the key features of the sample and the observations .",
    "more details can be found in aforementioned papers .    *",
    "the observations were carried out on the @xmath26 m telescope located at calar alto observatory from the year of @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the foces chelle spectrograph was used to obtain the high - resolution spectra , providing @xmath29 spectral orders in total that started at @xmath30  and ended at @xmath31 . *",
    "the detector was a ccd chip with @xmath32 pixels , and the size for each pixel is @xmath33 @xmath34 m .",
    "a two - pixel bin results in a @xmath35 resolution power ( @xmath36 ) . * the total exposure time is divided into more than two exposures .",

    "the spectra were reduced from the program designed for foces spectrograph @xcite , which worked under the idl environment .",
    "cosmic rays and bad pixels were removed by careful comparisons of the exposures from the same object .",
    "the instrumental response and background scatter light were also considered during the data reducing .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the methods and key information our studies based on , including the atmospheric model , the determinations of stellar parameters , the atomic line data , and the kinematic properties of our program stars .",
    "stellar atmospheric model is the foundation of the spectrum synthesis .",
    "our work adopted the mafags opacity sampling ( os ) model .",
    "this code was developed by @xcite and updated by @xcite with the new iron atomic data computed by @xcite .",
    "mafags os code describes a one - dimensional plane - parallel model with @xmath39 layers overall in the hydrostatic equilibrium state .",
    "the chemical homogeneity and local thermal equilibrium is assumed throughout the atmosphere .",
    "this model atmosphere was also applied in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the comparison between mafags and marcs os model has been performed by @xcite .",
    "although differences of the temperatures between those two models exist outside @xmath40 and inside @xmath41 , both of these regions barely influence the synthetic copper spectral line profile .      for all of our program stars",
    ", we directly adopted the stellar parameters derived by @xcite . by fitting the theoretical profiles to the observational data ,",
    "two balmer lines were used to derive the effective temperatures ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the hydrogen broadening theory involved in the theoretical profile calculation was from @xcite .",
    "the surface gravities ( @xmath43 ) were obtained by @xmath44 = [ mass / luminosity ] + 4[{t_{\\rm eff}}]$ ] , where the stellar mass and luminosity were evaluated with the help of evolutionary tracks @xcite and hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "in addition , the microturbulence velocities ( @xmath45 ) were determined simultaneously with the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) : the [ fe / h ] determined from line is supposed to be independent of the equivalent width .",
    "the final uncertainties in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath45 were estimated to be @xmath46 k , @xmath47 dex , @xmath48 dex , and @xmath49 km s@xmath50 , respectively .",
    "we used a set of calibrated @xmath51 values , each of which could reproduce the solar copper abundance independently , as presented by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the van der waals damping constants ( @xmath52 ) for were calculated according to @xcite .",
    "five lines can be seen in our foces spectra . for the evaluation of copper abundance , @xmath53  and @xmath54",
    "are not good indicators , for both of them are badly blended in most of our program stars . as a result ,",

    "the @xmath51 values were rectified from the non - lte solar spectrum fitting , and the van der waals damping constants ( @xmath52 ) were calculated according to @xcite +      similar to the stellar parameters , we also adopted the population identified by @xcite for our program stars , which was based on the kinematic features , stellar ages , [ al / mg ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios .",
    "most of the stars were classified as thin - disk , thick - disk , and halo population , whereas the rest were the stars with peculiarities .",
    "lte assumption provides us a simple way to calculate the population of each energy level and number densities of different ionization stages for a given element , while non - lte calculations require to solve the detailed statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "thus , a reliable atomic model of copper is indispensable .",
    "the atomic model of copper has been described in the previous paper @xcite and the grotrian diagram of the model can also be seen there .",
    "we modeled the copper atom with @xmath70 orbits , @xmath29 energy levels ( @xmath71 states for and the ground state for ) and @xmath72 transitions , and the fine structure for the levels with low excitation energy was also included .",
    "the atomic data of such complex structure are obtained from both laboratory measurements ( nist database , @xcite @xcite ) and theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "in addition , the excitation and ionization caused by inelastic collisions were also considered .",
    "the data for collisions with neutral hydrogen were obtained based on the @xcite formula @xcite presented by @xcite , and we decreased the collisional rates by an order of magnitude ( @xmath73@xmath74 ) under the suggestion of @xcite .",
    "the excitation and ionization caused by inelastic collisions with electrons are calculated according to a number of theoretical work @xcite .",
    "we used a revised detail program @xcite with accelerated lambda iteration method to perform the statistical equilibrium calculations .    in figure [ fig1 ] , we present how the departure coefficients ( @xmath75 ) of the selected levels vary with the continuum optical depth at @xmath76  ( @xmath77 ) for the model atmosphere of hd@xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the ratio of the number density of non - lte ( @xmath80 ) to that of lte ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "hd@xmath78 is a typical star with moderate temperature and metallicity among our sample , which is randomly selected as an example for the convenience of discussion .",
    "the departure coefficients for important levels and ground state are shown in the figure .",
    "it also shows that the number densities of these levels begin to underpopulate outside the layers with @xmath82 due to the overionization .",
    "in our analysis , the transitions of the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) were calculated according to @xcite with rs coupling method . for the lines we used , if the intervals of hfs components are within @xmath83 m , we combined them together .",
    "the adopted solar copper abundance is the value derived from the meteorites , which is @xmath84 @xcite , and the oscillator strengths were also calibrated based on this value as described in aforementioned section .",
    "additionally , the ratio between two copper isotopes ( @xmath85cu and @xmath86cu ) was assumed to be @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "an idl based program siu was used to perform the line formation in our abundance determinations , which was developed by @xcite . in our analysis ,",
    "the broadenings caused by the macroturbulence , rotation , and instrument were treated as one single gauss broadening factor , being convolved with the synthetic spectra to fit the observed line profile .",
    "the comparison between the synthetic and observed line profile at @xmath88  for hd@xmath78 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] as an example . the observed spectrum and theoretical synthesis",

    "the derived abundances with both lte and non - lte calculations are listed in table [ tab2 ] , where the results of each individual line are also presented .",
    "the final abundance of each star is given by calculating the arithmetical mean value of every line used in the analysis .",
    "the trend of [ cu / fe ] to [ fe / h ] for our program stars is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the errors in the figure are evaluated by computing the standard deviations of the abundances derived from different spectral lines .",

    "+   +   +      the final results in table [ tab2 ] show that the abundances derived from non - lte calculations are larger than those from lte ones for our program stars .",
    "the non - lte correction for individual spectral line can reach @xmath101 dex for the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "the increasing of the copper abundance in non - lte calculation is the consequence of the underpopulation of the lower energy levels ( and ) , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "the non - lte effect is different , reflecting the properties of corresponding energy levels and associated transitions .",

    "on the other hand , since most abundance analyses are based on the two copper strong lines , one need to be aware of the non - lte departures , especially for the metal - poor stars .",
    "numbers of studies for copper abundance have been carried out so far , allowing us to compare our results with those derived by several different groups based on lte calculations . comparing with the work published in recent years , we found @xmath108 stars are in common ( @xmath109 of them are studied at least twice in different papers ) . in figure [ fig6 ]",

    "* ) have modelled the galactic chemical evolution of copper .",
    "the most difficult part in the modeling is to approach satisfactory copper abundances at both metal - poor end and solar - metallicity : normal type ii supernovae yields from @xcite case b give a good approaching to the observed [ cu / fe ] trend for [ fe / h ] @xmath142 , but lead to overabundant for copper at lower metallicity , while the yields from @xcite sne ii mixed with hypernovae give a better fitting in the metal - poor end but fail to reproduce the observational trend at the solar - metallicity @xcite .",
    "the ways to solve this inconsistency are so limited because : ( 1 ) the contribution from @xmath19process can not be changed freely @xcite and ( 2 ) there are still large uncertainties in modeling the yields from low- and intermediate - mass agb stars or supernovae explosion events @xcite . since the departures from lte for cu i show a clear dependence on metallicity , the copper abundances of the very / extremely metal - poor stars are expected to increase towards lower metallicity ( @xcite @xcite ; shi et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) . consequently , before modifying gce models , a firm and reliable observational trend of [ cu / fe ] should be established first .",
    "the non - lte results for disk stars suggest that there may be a bending - like feature at [ fe / h ] @xmath143 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) , where the [ cu / fe ] trend goes up at first , but slightly decreases as the [ fe / h ] becomes higher .",

    "one of the explanations for the bending might be sne ia .",
    "however , the typical timescale for the chemical enrichment from sne ia in the milky way is model - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus not strictly constrained .",

    "two lines , @xmath88  and @xmath102  are more sensitive to non - lte effects . the non - lte corrections for these lines can reach @xmath145 dex at the metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "the weaker line @xmath103  shows relatively small but still not negligible non - lte effects , with a maximum departure of @xmath146 dex in our sample .",
    "the copper abundances are underestimated in lte calculations .",
    "taking non - lte effects into account , the copper abundances increase for all of our program stars .",
    "3 .   the non - lte effects clearly show dependence on metallicity , and they increase with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "our non - lte results show that there might be a [ cu / fe ] plateau in the metallicity range @xmath135 [ fe / h ] @xmath136 , however , it need more data to confirm this result .",
    "there is a hint that the thick- and thin - disk stars have different behaviors in [ cu / fe ] , and a bending for disk stars may exist .",
