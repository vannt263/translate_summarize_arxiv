    "the cosmological matter antimatter asymmetry , the ratio of the baryon density to the entropy density of the universe , y_b = n_b - n_s = ( 0.6 - 1)10 ^ -10 , [ blub ] can in principle be understood in theories where baryon number , c and cp are not conserved @xcite .",
    "the presently observed value of the baryon asymmetry is then explained as a consequence of the spectrum and interactions of elementary particles , together with the cosmological evolution .",
    "a crucial ingredient of baryogenesis is the connection between baryon number ( @xmath5 ) and lepton number ( @xmath6 ) in the high - temperature , symmetric phase of the standard model . due to the chiral nature of the weak interactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not conserved@xcite . at zero temperature",

    "it is generally believed that @xmath5 and @xmath6 changing processes are in thermal equilibrium for temperatures in the range t_ew ~100   < t < t_sph ~10 ^ 12  .",
    "the non - conservation of baryon and lepton number has a profound effect on the generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry .",
    "[ sphal1 ] suggests that any @xmath8 asymmetry generated before the electroweak phase transition , i.e. , at temperatures @xmath9 , will be washed out .",

    "an analysis of the chemical potentials of all particle species in the high - temperature phase yields the following relation between the baryon asymmetry @xmath10 and the corresponding @xmath6 and @xmath3 asymmetries @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively@xcite , [ basic ] y_b  =  a  y_b - l  =  aa-1  y_l , where @xmath13 is a number @xmath14 . in the standard model with three generations and two higgs doublets",

    "the connection between lepton number and the baryon asymmetry is lost if baryogenesis takes place at or below the fermi scale@xcite .",

    "the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits can be interpreted as a result of neutrino oscillations . for hierarchical neutrinos",
