    "trapped ions are envisaged as a future platform for quantum information technologies and for the realization of a full scale universal quantum computer @xcite . in this context",
    "an architecture has been proposed @xcite for the realization of a scalable , integrated ion trap quantum computer .    however , there are experimental challenges facing its practical realization related to the speed of a two - ion entangling gate which is essential for universal quantum computation . to date ,",
    "most of the schemes proposed are based on resolving motional side bands of the ion within the trap , which restricts the gate time to be longer than the trap period @xcite .",
    "the fastest entangling gates on trapped ions take several to tens of @xmath3@xmath4 @xcite . speeding up",
    "these gates would represent a major advance toward large - scale quantum computation .    to overcome this limitation ,",
    "a gate protocol that uses resonant laser pulses has been proposed @xcite . here",
    "the pulses give state - dependent momentum kicks to the ion with one @xmath5 pulse that transfers the population from the ground state to the excited level of the ion , and a second counter - propagating pulse which coherently reverses the process back to the ground state via stimulated emission .",
    "each pulse pair induces a force in the same direction which is proportional to the number of pairs used for the momentum kick .",
    "when the timing of the incident pulses is precisely controlled , fast entangling gates can be implemented with minimal motional heating .",
    "experiments have been demonstrated to realize ultrafast gates with only single - spin operations , with a frequency - tripled multi - watt yttrium vanadate laser producing off - resonant picosecond pulses at a repetition rate of 120  mhz .",
    "these pulses are used to drive raman transitions and to enable quantum logic in a ytterbium ion ( yb@xmath0 ) @xcite .        here",
    ", we demonstrate a fiber laser system designed for ultrafast quantum gate application with yb@xmath6 which is tunable to the exact resonance of an atomic transition .",
    "the source operates at a repetition rate of 300  mhz which corresponds to the cavity 5th harmonic , and this number can be scaled up by mode locking the cavity to higher order harmonics leading to an increase in the gate speed .",
    "the laser generates 2.5  ps uv pulses , a maximum power of 190  mw and a wavelength that is resonant with the strong , 369.53  nm @xmath7 - @xmath8 transition of yb@xmath6 .",
    "uv pulses are generated starting from an amplified mode - locked telecom band fiber laser emitting 55  fs pulses .",
    "subsequently the pulses propagate in a highly non - linear fiber ( hnlf ) where a supercontinuum spectrum is generated . a portion of the spectrum around 1108.6  nm is selected from the supercontinuum for the generation of uv power via two frequency upconversion stages in nonlinear crystals .",
    "our architecture allows multiple wavelength channels in the supercontinuum to run in parallel for different applications .",
    "for example three stages of frequency doubling of the 1905  nm wavelength could produce a novel source for two photon cooling of hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "this system architecture offers greater flexibility when compared to commercially available pulsed uv lasers which have a limited range of available repetition rates , wavelengths , and output powers . except for the harmonic generation stages ,",
    "laser architecture is fiber based , providing stability and compactness .",
    "the fundamental oscillator in our system is an er - doped linear fiber laser with a length of @xmath9 170 cm ( see top - left in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ) .",
    "it operates at 1564  nm wavelength , pumped by a 976  nm laser diode .",
    "fiber lengths are optimized to balance dispersion and non - linearity .",
    "passive mode locking is achieved using a fiber butt coupled , 1.3  mm @xmath10 1.3  mm semiconductor - saturable - absorber mirror ( sesam ) with 9% absorption .",
    "the fundamental repetition rate of the cavity is 60  mhz which can be increased by increasing the pump diode current and altering the cavity birefringence , to produce harmonics in the cavity .",
    "increase in the pump current allows multiple solitons to co - exist in the cavity and cavity birefringence is changed by manual fiber polarization controllers .",
    "after optimizations we get a clean and stable ( up to many weeks ) 5th harmonic and ramp - up the repetition rate to 300  mhz with low timing jitter . to synchronize the laser pulses with the pulse selecting modulators and",
    "further minimize the pulse to pulse timing jitter the repetition rate is locked to 300.00000  mhz by introducing a free space piezo - mounted mirror ( pmm ) on a translation stage at one of the cavity ends .",
    "a repetition rate error signal is produced by rf mixing of an external clock with the laser repetition rate . a direct digital synthesizer ( dds )",
    "divides the 300  mhz optical pulse repetition rate by a factor of two to generate a 150  mhz laser repetition rate signal which is then mixed against a 150  mhz reference signal generated by rf - filtering the 15th harmonic from a 10  mhz clock reference .",
    "the error signal is fed into a srs sim960 proportional - integral - differential ( pid ) controller which servos the pmm to stabilize the laser s repetition rate .",
    "the rest of the laser system inherits this repetition rate .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) the laser pulses from the fundamental oscillator are amplified to 120mw with an ipg photonics ear - ik - c - pm erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) .",
    "the amplified pulses are compressed to 55  fs with 50  cm piece of large effective area fiber ( leaf ) and spliced with 14  cm of sumitomo hnlf .",
    "low soliton number ( @xmath1115 ) in leaf and short pulse duration ensure coherence in the supercontinuum and forthcoming stages , which has been detailed previous @xcite for this system .",
    "pulses passing through the hnlf have sufficient peak intensities to generate an octave - spanning supercontinuum , 1000  nm  @xmath12  2000  nm @xcite . in the future ,",
    "the ends of this supercontinuum could be used as a f-2f interferometer to generate a signal useful for stabilization of the seed laser s carrier envelope phase .",
    "wavelength selection is dependent on the requirements of the desired application .",
    "we select 1108.6  nm light from the supercontinuum by first spectral slicing around 1110  nm with a wavelength - division - multiplexer ( wdm ) and then coarse filtering using a custom - made chirped fiber bragg grating ( cfbg ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ irpulse](b ) .",
    "after passing through series of these stages we have a total of @xmath9 30  mw of average power , sufficient for the high power amplifier . before amplification , pulses are chirped with 2  km of single mode fiber ( smf ) , between the first two pre - amplification stages .",
    "a keopsys ( f - cyfa-016 - 01 ) 5  w ytterbium - doped fiber amplifier ( ydfa ) has been used for high power amplification and provides a maximum of 4.7  w average power at output .",
    "in contrast to the ir amplification stages , for frequency up - conversion we want pulses with the highest intensities in order to obtain a strong nonlinear effects . the ydfa output is collimated in free space and passes through a pair of lightsmyth lsfsg-1000 transmission gratings , configured with anomalous dispersion ( see fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) and an inter - grating distance of about 2.4  m to remove the chirping , which compress the 30  ps pulses to 1.9  ps as indicated in fig .",
    "[ irpulse](a ) .",
    "frequency resolved optical gating ( frog ) was used to measure the pulse length with a mesaphotonics frogscan equipped with an ocean optics hr4000 spectrometer which covers a wavelength range of @xmath9 503  nm-577  nm . during dechirping , unwanted amplified spontaneous emission centered at roughly 1070  nm in the ydfa output spectrum is removed by spatial filtering .",
    "the overall compressor efficiency is 75% , with most losses from multiple passes through the @xmath1390% efficient transmission gratings .",
    "hence the maximum average power available for frequency up - conversion of the compressed pulses is 3.5  w.    up - conversion is a two stage process that starts with second harmonic generation ( shg ) of the compressed 1108.6  nm ir laser pulses to green 554.3  nm pulses .",
    "the vertically polarized compressed 1108.6  nm pulses are focused to a @xmath9  22  @xmath3 m @1/@xmath14 radius spot in a type i , quasi - phase - matched ( qpm ) , periodically - poled - stoichiometric litao@xmath15 ( ppslt ) crystal , with an estimated peak intensity 0.38  gw/@xmath16 .",

    "[ setup](b ) an adjustable delay is introduced and the beams are then recombined to generate uv pulses via sum frequency generation ( sfg ) .",
    "selection of an appropriate crystal is vital to achieving efficient non - linear conversion of the pump pulses into uv light .",
    "this becomes more crucial when dealing with ultrafast pump beams with high repetition rates and therefore limited intensities .    crystals from the borate family are a promising option for high power uv generation due to their high transparency in the uv spectral region and high optical damage threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use a critically phase matched lib@xmath15o@xmath17 ( lbo ) crystal ( 10  mm  @xmath10  3  mm  @xmath10  3  mm , raicol crystals , ar coated for all three sfg wavelengths ) , with a theoretically estimated acceptance bandwidth of @xmath9  1.32  mrad@xmath18 cm @xcite , operating in a type i configuration .",
    "second harmonic and residual ir beams are focused to spot sizes of 35  @xmath3 m and 40  @xmath3 m @ 1/e@xmath19 radius respectively inside the lbo .",
    "these beams carry maximum peak powers of 1.74  kw and 2.9  kw respectively , corresponding to peak intensities of 35  mw/@xmath16 and  57  mw/@xmath16 . in these conditions ,",
    "we produce a maximum of 190  mw uv power , giving a single pass uv conversion efficiency @xmath20 of 8%w@xmath21 in sfg .",
    "the lack of saturation roll - off in the uv power graph indicates that the uv conversion efficiency is limited by the input powers , as shown in the fig .",

    "the sfg - pump beams both have an m@xmath19 of @xmath9  1.4 , while the resulting uv beam has m@xmath22 and average circularity @xmath11  40% .",
    "immediately after isolating the uv beam from the ir and green components , a telescope consisting of cylindrical and plano - convex lenses is placed in the beam path for beam profile correction and collimation , and as a result the uv m@xmath19 is improved to 1.5 , comparable to the m@xmath19 of the input beams .",
    "the initial lower beam quality indicates that spatial walk - off in the pump beams is limiting beam overlap and hence conversion efficiency .",
    "spatial walk - off can be reduced to improve sfg efficiency by employing a combination of crystals before lbo @xcite .",
    "group velocity mismatch ( gvm ) could be another factor in degrading uv power due to the long length of the crystal .",
    "the time bandwidth product ( tbwp ) of uv pulses is measured to be @xmath9  0.94 , as compared to 0.315 for a sech@xmath19 shaped pulse .",
    "the tbwp is higher than ideal due to uncompensated higher order dispersion in the grating compressor , which could be inferred from chirping in the fundamental ir pulses as shown in fig .",
    "[ irpulse](a ) .",

    "we find that the uv spectrum coincides with the spectrum peak of a reference external cavity diode laser ( ecdl ) , locked with the @xmath7 - @xmath8 yb@xmath0 transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ uvpower](b ) .",
    "the uv center wavelength can be tuned to the exact resonance by slight variation in the crystal phase matching ( within acceptance bandwidth ) or by heating / cooling of the wavelength selecting cfbgs . when the laser is fully optimized , uv pulse peak power is stable within 5% over many hours .",
    "the power fluctuations happen on a fast time scale comparable to the laser repetition rate with a pulse timing jitter of < 15ps when the repetition rate of the fundamental oscillator is locked and stabilized .",
    "conventional techniques for characterization of ultrafast pulses rely on the shg from time delayed copies of pulses .",
    "these schemes are limited to ir and visible spectrum .",
    "implementation of such schemes for uv pulses is cumbersome due to unavailability of suitable non - linear crystals and spectrometers .",

    "generating arbitrary uv pulse patterns by switching on and off individual pulses is one of the most critical steps for the implementation of fast quantum logic gates .",

    "we have instead implemented a two - stage solution based on fast low - power ir switching and slower high power uv switching to generate almost arbitrary patterns .",
    "for fast ir switching we use an eospace polarization - maintaining lithium niobate electro - optic modulator ( eom ) between the last pre - amplification stage and the ydfa .",
    "the eom has insertion losses @xmath11  4  db and requires a rf driving voltage of v@xmath32  @xmath11  3.5  v. the pulse sequences are generated by digitally modulating the eom with amplified and dc biased pulses from a 12.5  ghz picosecond pulse labs model 12050 pulse pattern generator ( ppg ) .",
