    "subsurface oceans in jupiter s icy moons could provide a present - day setting for extra - terrestrial life within our solar system . of the three jovian icy moons ,",
    "europa is favored as having the greatest potential to sustain life , based on strong evidence for a persistent ocean directly in contact with rock .",
    "galileo radio science measurements indicate europa is differentiated , with a low density water - rich layer between 80 and 170 km thick ( anderson et al . , 1998 , carr et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "galileo magnetometry provides compelling evidence for a present - day ocean through the induced magnetic field ( kivelson et al . , 2000 , zimmer et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "estimates of the ice shell thickness of europa are uncertain",
    ". thermal models of the ice shell of europa predict a thickness of @xmath030  km ( ojakangas and stevenson , 1989 ) .",
    "studies of galileo spacecraft data have resulted in contradictory constraints for the ice shell thickness .",
    "analysis of the galileo magnetometer - derived oceanic conductivities , combined with radio doppler data - derived interior models and laboratory conductivity vs concentration data , constrain the ice thickness to be @xmath115  km with a best fit value of @xmath2  km ( hand and chyba , 2007 ) .",
    "galileo imaging of pits , domes , and dark spots provide an ice shell thickness constraint of 3 - 10  km ( pappalardo et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "crater analyses , also obtained from galileo images , constrain europa s ice thickness to @xmath33  km ( turtle et al . ,",
    "2001 ) based on the need to isostatically support central features , and to at least 19 - 25  km thick from the thermal state inferred from depth - size relationships ( schenk , 2002 ) .    the most promising technique for direct detection of subsurface oceans in jovian icy moons is ice - penetrating radar ( ipr ) . a dual - frequency system , such as that described by bruzzone et al . ,",
    "2011 , is capable of providing high - resolution images at shallow depths ( @xmath15  km ) and characterize the depth of the ice up to 30  km with 100  m resolution .",
    "unambiguous observation of a subsurface ocean demands that the detection technique have as high depth sensitivity as possible . to achieve this ,",
    "the use of low frequencies ( @xmath130  mhz ) has been proposed ( bruzzone et al , 2011 ) .",
    "the main challenges involved with ipr are surface clutter and radio absorption of the ice , which can be reduced by use of low frequencies .",
    "however , the radio loud environment of jupiter at frequencies @xmath4  mhz requires a relatively strong transmitter .",
    "we explore a passive interferometric reflectometry technique that makes use of jupiter s decametric ( dam ) radio emission in the 1 - 40 mhz band .",
    "we argue that the dam background that interferes low frequency ipr can be used as a source of ice depth sounding .",
    "this technique could be an attractive complement to a radar system because it can share the same dipole antenna and requires very low power passive components .",
    "interferometric reflectometry could also extend the frequency band of observation to lower frequencies by operating as an electrically short dipole , further increasing the sensitivity to deep subsurface oceans .",
    "a passive measurement system could also serve as a backup to ipr in case of transmitter failure , thereby reducing the risks associated with the instrument .",
    "interferometric reflectometry was first applied in the dover heights radio astronomical observatory in the 1940 s ( bolton , 1982 ) . in that setup ,",
    "an antenna placed on a cliff observed both the direct emission of a radio source and its reflection on the sea surface .",
    "the signal was autocorrelated forming a virtual two - element interferometer .",
    "the baseline formed by the sea surface reflection provided one of the first demonstrations of radio emission from discrete sources ( bolton and stanley , 1948 ) along with the first identification of cosmic radio sources including centaurus a and the crab nebula ( bolton 1948 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this technique was born out of limited resources , not unlike the case for deep space probes .",
    "the interferometric reflectometry technique is currently applied in the measurement of snow depth using gps signals ( larson et al . , 2008 , gutmann et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "the interference between the gps signal and its subsurface reflections modulates the signal to noise ratio with a sinusoidal wave whose frequency is directly proportional the snow depth ( larson et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the technique has been successfully demonstrated and validated by comparison with other measurements ( gutmann et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "the geometry for the application of interferometric reflectometry to jovian moon ice depth measurements is shown in figure  [ fig : janine_concept ] .",
    "jupiter s radio emission arrives from a distance of @xmath5  km to the vicinity of an icy moon . at the sub - jovian point , where the spacecraft lies directly between jupiter and the icy moon ,",
    "an antenna receiver system records a sample of the decametric radio emission .",
    "the same emission strikes the surface of the icy moon and its echoes arrive at the spacecraft at a later time ( @xmath61  ms ) .",
    "the antenna beam pointed at the icy moon samples the echoed radio emission , which is cross - correlated with the direct emission to produce fringes .",
    "the cross - correlation peaks at delays corresponding to the moon surface and subsurface ice - water boundary reflection layers .",
    "the amplitudes of the cross - correlation peaks are related to the dielectric properties of the ice .",
    "therefore , the cross - correlation has the potential to reveal the presence of sharp boundaries that would be associated with a subsurface ocean or liquid water deposits in the ice shell .        in this paper",
    ", we will describe the physics of the passive interferometric reflectometer concept . in section  2",
    "we briefly review the properties of jupiter s decametric radio emission .",
    "section  3 gives a summary of the properties of jovian moon ice shells .",
    "section 4 describes the mathematical details of interferometric reflectometry and provides estimates for the sensitivity and resolution of the technique .",
    "section 5 compares the expected sensitivity of interferometric reflectometry with ice penetrating radar .",
    "section 6 summarizes our results and outlines the next steps in the development of this measurement technique .",
    "jupiter s decametric radio emissions are some of the brightest signals in the solar system for frequencies between 1 - 40  mhz .",
    "the strength of the signal is due to a resonance interaction called the cyclotron maser instability ( wu and lee , 1979 ; treumann 2006 ) .",
    "the emission has a sharp cutoff at 40 mhz , which corresponds to the electron cyclotron frequency for the jovian magnetic field lines .",
    "radiation above 40 mhz , due to the synchrotron emission of electrons in jupiter s magnetic field lines , is significantly weaker .",
    "the flux density of jupiter s radio emission , as seen from europa , ganymede , and callisto , is shown in figure  [ fig : jupiter_flux ] .",
    "below 40 mhz , the decametric radiation from jupiter is more than several thousands of times above the galactic background . in this frequency band",
    ", jupiter is the most luminous object in the sky . unlike the galactic background , which is diffuse ,",
    "jupiter s brightness distribution is confined to a small region in the sky seen by the icy moons ( see section 2.2 ) . as will be discussed in section 4.6",
    ", this means that the depth resolution will not be source structure limited .",
    "there are several different sources of strong decametric emission from jupiter , each with different characteristics .",
    "the most reliable emission is that near the central longitude of 270@xmath7 .",
    "this source ( referred to as  non - io - a \" ) is not the strongest , but it occurs nearly 100% of the time ( carr et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "the second most active source is  non - io - b \" , which is located at a central meridian longitude of 90@xmath7 - 180@xmath7 .",
    "this source is active approximately 40% of the time ( carr et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "the strongest source of emissions by far is a feature that occurs when io is at 90@xmath7 phase relative to the observer and the central meridian longitude of jupiter is 90@xmath7 - 180@xmath7 .",
    "this source is referred to as  io - b \" because it is caused by the interaction between io and the non - io - b source ( thiemann , 1977 ) .",
    "the non - io - b source is active about 40% of the time ( thiemann , 1977 ) .",
    "an io - a source is also active at the non - io - a longitude when io is at 240@xmath7 of orbital phase ( thiemann , 1977 ) .",
    "all of the above sources vary on time scales of minutes and in amplitude by about 20 db ( carr et al . , 1983 ) which are referred to as long bursts ( l - bursts ) .",
    "however , the io sources all produce stronger bursts than the non - io sources and also produce short bursts ( s - bursts ) of duration less than 1  second that are the strongest sources of all .",
    "these bursts make up less than 10% of the bursts emitted from jupiter ( carr et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "these sources are also quite small , with evidence from the very first vlbi observations showing both the s - bursts and l - bursts come from a region smaller than 400  km ( dulk 1970 , carr et al . , 1970 , lynch et al . , 1976 )",
    "the presence of signals with various characteristics can be used for passive radio detection .",
    "the predictability of their location and time of activity will be beneficial for planning observations .",
    "the s - bursts and l - bursts are particularly attractive due to the highly localized source and temporal structure . in this study",
    "we will use a thermal noise model for the phase of the signal . as will be discussed in section 4 ,",
    "the integration time required for this passive measurement is comparable to the duration of the s - bursts and l - bursts .",
    "it is likely that the spectro - temporal characteristics of these bursts ( zarka 1996 , zarka 2004 ) , not included in this study , will improve the estimates made with our thermal noise model , and will be the subject of a future study .",
    "galileo and voyager spacecraft images reveal a variety of ice surface features of europa and ganymede ( greeley et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "some of these features indicate that the surface of these moons were once or may currently be geologically active ( schmidt , 2011 ) . for a radio probe",
    ", this means that the surface clutter , due to features of size comparable to or greater than the wavelength , can be a potentially large source of signal loss .",
    "this is the case both for radar measurements and the passive interferometric reflectometer concept presented here .",
    "the diffusion effects of surface clutter drive the use of long wavelengths in the decametric range ( bruzzone et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "this plays a significant role in the detection sensitivity of oceans beneath a thick shell of ice .",
    "surface roughness , due to features smaller than the wavelength of the radio probe , is typically treated with a fractal model .",
    "bruzzone et al . ,",
    "2011 estimated surface roughness losses on ganymede .",
    "the results are , however , of a speculative nature since there is not sufficient data on the surface characteristics at decametric scales . in bruzzone",
    "2011 , the sensitivity to subsurface oceans is 20  db higher at 20  mhz compared to 50  mhz due to surface roughness and clutter effects .",
    "if the interferometric reflectometry technique can perform observations at lower frequencies ( perhaps as low as @xmath63  mhz ) , this could potentially provide large gains in sensitivity for subsurface ocean detection .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the use of low frequencies is highly recommended by eluszkiewicz , 2004 based on considerations of the existence and thickness of a regolith on the surface of europa",
    ".    we will not include surface roughness in the estimates discussed here .",
    "the losses are similar to those presented in radar studies and the reader can refer to bruzzone et al . , 2011 and berquin et al , 2013 for more information .",
    "the attenuation length of the jovian moon ice shells has not been measured and current expectations are largely model dependent . in this study",
    "we will treat the attenuation as a free parameter and assume no particular model .",
    "we treat the absorption losses of radio signal propagation @xmath8 as an exponential function @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance of the radio wave propagates in the ice and @xmath11 is a characteristic attenuation length of the ice .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 corresponds to one e - folding loss in radio signal power , which is equivalent to a 4.3  db loss and loss @xmath12 in db / km , which is a common parameter provided in the literature , is given by @xmath13  db@xmath14 . ] .",
    "the ice attenuation models of europa by chyba et al . , 1998 vary by an order of magnitude .",
    "the equivalent total two - way attenuation modeled by chyba et al . , 1998 correspond to attenuation lengths @xmath150.2  km , on the pessimistic side , and @xmath152.6  km on the optimistic side .",
    "moore , 2000 quotes a range of @xmath169 - 16 db / km corresponding to attenuation lengths of @xmath150.25 - 0.5  km .",
    "given that radio absorption of the ice layers are largely unconstrained , we will treat the attenuation length as an unknown in our estimates and use the results of current models as indicative of the plausible values of @xmath11 .",
    "the thickness of the ice shell @xmath17 will also be treated as an unknown in this study . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "data constraints predict a range ice thicknesses between @xmath63  km ( pappalardo , 1998 ) and @xmath1830  km ( ojakangas and stevenson , 1989 ) .    in this study",
    "we will model the index of refraction of the ice with @xmath19 ( chyba , 1998 ) .",
    "the index of refraction is particularly relevant in the estimation of transmission and reflection coefficients . as will be discussed in section 4 , the dielectric properties of ice limit the operation of the passive concept to a region of @xmath20 around the sub - jovian point of the icy moon .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this is the region where ice penetrating radar measurements are most severely affected by jovian decametric radio emissions .      in the nominal scenario for radio detection of subsurface oceans and liquid water ,",
    "there is a highly reflective boundary with the ice , which provides a sharp transition between the ice index of refraction @xmath19 ( chyba , 1998 ) and the ocean water index of refraction @xmath21 ( bruzzone et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "we will make our sensitivity estimates based on this assumption .",
    "regions of the ice containing unfrozen brine inclusions will be subject to strong reflections dependent on the dielectric properties of the brines , an area of active research for antarctic ices ( macgregor et al .",
    "marion et al . , 2005 , suggest that salt inclusions within the ice are thermodynamically stable only in the lower 10% of a conductively cooling ice shell of 20  km thickness .",
    "this principle holds for any thickness of or salinity , as we have confirmed using frezchem ( marion et al . ,",
    "2005 ) assuming a temperature - dependent thermal conductivity as per vance et al .",
    "closer to the moon s surface , salt inclusions could be present as trapped solid precipitates .",
    "these should move downward over time through some combination of solid - state diapirism ( pappalardo and barr 2004 , quick et al .",
    "2013 ) and possibly two - phase melt transport ( kalousova et .",
    "al . , 2014 ) .",
    "the existence of near surface melts has been be inferred from surface geological features , notably by schmidt et al . ,",
    "active chaotic terrains may produce transient liquids within 1  km of the surface . at such shallow depths",
    ", liquid brines would stand out clearly in radio measurements .",
    "it is also possible to look for perched liquids in shallower ice .",
    "a study of the chaos terrains on the surface of europa estimates that there is liquid water within a few km beneath the surface ( schmidt et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "at these depths , the detection of the existence of liquid brines would manifest itself as a bright reflection due to the sudden change in index of refraction .    over geologically short time",
    "scales it might be expected that brine inclusions should flow outward gravitationally , as investigated for europa in the context of perched brines by sotin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , nimmo and giese ( 2005 ) , and in the context of convective ice diapirs by quick et al .",
    "this section describes the experiment model for passive ice depth sounding using jupiter s radio emission . in this study",
    ", we treat the ice layer as a smooth dielectric sphere with a sharp transition to a reflective subsurface ocean .",
    "we include the losses due to geometric factors calculated using geometric optics for a plane wave reflecting off the surface of a sphere .",
    "we then add the effects of dielectric reflection / transmission coefficients along with absorption in the next subsections .",
    "the expected results for an instrument consisting of a dipole antenna with a correlator are given in sections 4.5 and 4.6 .",
    "in this subsection we calculate the signal losses due to the geometric factor of a plane wave reflected off a spherical surface .",
    "we start with the geometry shown in figure  [ fig : surface_reflection_geometry ] where a plane wave , coming from the direction of jupiter , is incident on the surface of an icy moon with angle @xmath22 .",
    "the reflection of the signal is visible from a spacecraft at altitude @xmath23 . for this study",
    ", we are considering wavelengths in the order of @xmath24  10  -  100  meters while the radii of jovian icy moons lie in the range of @xmath251560  -  2634  km .",
    "given that @xmath26 we use geometric optics to estimate the geometric factor losses .",
    "even in the geometric optics approximation , the calculation of the geometric factor is not trivial .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix  a for a rigorous calculation of the geometric factors along with a comparison to zemax ( ` http://www.radiantzemax.com ` ) simulations .",
    "we can characterize the behavior of the detector position and altitude dependence on the reflected signal strength as follows .    at the sub - jovian point , where @xmath27 , the geometric factor is given by @xmath28 note that in the limit of @xmath29 this expression approaches @xmath30 , which is a loss of order 25% for a spacecraft at 100  km altitude over europa .",
    "for @xmath31 the geometric factor approaches @xmath32 , which is expected from a distant source . at altitudes",
    "@xmath29 the geometric losses for an interferometric reflectometer are small , while for radar , the losses are always proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "this difference in behavior has a significant impact on the relative sensitivities of the two techniques .",
    "figure  [ fig : geom_fac_1 ] plots the behavior of the losses due to the geometric factor ( equation  [ eqn : geom_fac_subj ] ) for europa , ganymede , and callisto .",
    "the differences in behavior are due to the different radii of the icy moons .",

    "the angular dependence results in additional losses of @xmath182  db out to an incidence angle of @xmath34 . at @xmath35",
    "the losses are of 6  db with a drastic drop at higher angles . as will be discussed in the next subsection",

    "<S> we describe an interferometric reflectometer method for passive detection of subsurface oceans and liquid water in jovian icy moons using jupiter s decametric radio emission ( dam ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dam flux density exceeds 3,000 times the galactic background in the neighborhood of the jovian icy moons , providing a signal that could be used for passive radio sounding . </S>",
    "<S> an instrument located between the icy moon and jupiter could sample the dam emission along with its echoes reflected in the ice layer of the target moon . </S>",
    "<S> cross - correlating the direct emission with the echoes would provide a measurement of the ice shell thickness along with its dielectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> the interferometric reflectometer provides a simple solution to sub - jovian radio sounding of ice shells that is complementary to ice penetrating radar measurements better suited to measurements in the anti - jovian hemisphere that shadows jupiter s strong decametric emission . </S>",
    "<S> the passive nature of this technique also serves as risk reduction in case of radar transmitter failure . </S>",
    "<S> the interferometric reflectometer could operate with electrically short antennas , thus extending ice depth measurements to lower frequencies , and potentially providing a deeper view into the ice shells of jovian moons .    </S>",
