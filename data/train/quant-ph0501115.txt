    "many quantum information processes require specific pure entangled states , such as bell states , to succeed . after interacting with the environment",
    ", however , pure states inevitably decohere ; decoherence generally causes pure entangled states to become mixed and less entangled .",
    "quantum error correction  @xcite and entanglement distillation / concentration  @xcite have been developed to help cope with a noisy ( and hence decohering ) environment .",
    "on the other hand , there are implementations using mixed states to investigate quantum computing , e.g. , liquid - state nmr  @xcite . the states in this last example are highly mixed and have no entanglement .",
    "still , between highly entangled pure states and highly separable mixed states there exists a vast experimentally unexplored region in hilbert space ( more precisely , the space of density matrices ) , where states can be simultaneously mixed and entangled . the two - qubit system possesses the simplest and smallest hilbert space that permits the existence of entanglement .",
    "separate from the specific protocols which make use of the states , it is of fundamental interest to understand the preparation of one of the most basic quantum systems .",
    "although there have been many attempts  @xcite to synthesize two - qubit mixed polarization states , none has yet been able to create completely arbitrary two - qubit mixed states  @xcite .",
    "here we describe several two - photon polarization state implementations that should in principle enable preparation of arbitrary two - qubit mixed states , including states possessing all physical degrees of entanglement and entropy .",
    "the schemes we shall present facilitate state creation and allow access to two - qubit hilbert space and can be useful for current and future quantum information protocols . we remark that if there exist efficient two - qubit entangling gates such as cnot  @xcite , arbitrary state synthesis can be systematically implemented by first generating a purification  @xcite of the mixed state by adding ancillas , and then tracing over the ancillas . however ,",
    "efficient photon - polarization cnot gates do not exist  @xcite , so we rely on other degrees of freedom to introduce decoherence , leading to mixed states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief background discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we describe , in sec .  [",
    "sec : pure ] , two schemes to achieve _ arbitrary pure _ two - photon polarization states by employing downconversion in a two - crystal arrangement .",
    "the first one is based on the existence of schmidt decompositions .",
    "the second one utilizes the coherent superpositions of two downconversion processes embedded in an interferometric setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : arbmixed ] we describe how to extend these two schemes to realize arbitrary two - qubit _ mixed _ states ( schemes i and ii ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : redmixed ] we propose two reduced schemes ( iii and iv ) that provide practical ways to realize several important families of states that are currently of interest , including werner states  @xcite , maximally entangled mixed states  @xcite , collins - gisin states  @xcite , and arbitrary bell - diagonal states .",
    "scheme iii requires only two downconversion crystals , but can not synthesize all two - qubit states .",
    "scheme iv partially extends the set of attainable states , but requires four downconversion crystals . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] we summarize the four schemes and mention possible applications .",
    "readers who do not require full details but want an overview of the four schemes and synthesizable states can refer to table  [ tbl : comparison ] .",
    "the details of how to create particular families of states can be found around the equations [ ( [ eqn : mems ] ) , ( [ eqn : werner ] ) , ( [ eqn : cg ] ) , and ( [ eqn : bd ] ) ] describing these states .",
    "the entangled photon pairs we consider come from frequency - degenerate type - i spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc )  @xcite .",
    "the general state from spdc is a two - mode squeezed state consisting of vacuum and @xmath0-pair states  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a @xmath0-pair state , and @xmath3 is the relative amplitude ( typically of order @xmath4 ) to find a single pair .",
    "the post - selected 1-pair state @xmath5 is composed of two daughter photons , usually called _ signal _ and _",
    "idler_. for the present article , we limit our attention to the case where the signal and idler photons have approximately degenerate central frequencies , half that of the pump .",
    "( our schemes apply to nondegenerate case as well . ) when the downconversion momenta are well collimated or otherwise sharply selected ( experimentally by a small iris ) , one can neglect the momentum dependence of the pair state .",
    "the post - selected two - photon state can then be described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pump frequency . @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively represent the polarizations and frequencies of the two photons , with @xmath10 , the horizontal polarization , and @xmath11 , the vertical polarization .",

    "we consider thicknesses of waveplates and crystals that are much less than the coherence length @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of the pump , and hence we can safely use eq .",
    "( [ eqn : psi0 ] ) .",
    "the coherence length of downconversion photons ( @xmath26 ) is usually much smaller than @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 , because there are many ways to distribute the energy of the pump photon between the daughter photons in each pair , resulting in a large @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "using the method of schmidt decomposition  @xcite , an arbitrary two - qubit pure state @xmath29 can always be written using only two terms:@xmath30 , where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is orthogonal to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "now we describe how to prepare such a state .",
    "the creation of the entangled state @xmath38 from two - crystal downconversion was proposed in ref .",
    "consider two identically cut thin nonlinear crystals .",
    "suppose the first crystal s optic axis lies in the vertical plane defined by the directions of pump beam and the vertical polarization .",

    "we denote this process by @xmath41 .",
    "if the pump is @xmath40-polarized , no downconversion process will take place .",
    "suppose the second crystal is placed at an orientation rotated from the first crystal by @xmath42 about the pump direction .",
    "an @xmath40-polarized pump will now produce a pair of @xmath39-polarized photons @xmath43 , whereas no downconversion will occur if the pump is @xmath39-polarized  @xcite .",
    "with the two crystals placed in contact with each other , a pump in the state @xmath44 will produce a pair of photons in the state @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are tuned using waveplates acting on the pump polarization  @xcite .",

    "any @xmath56 rotation such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 on a polarization state can be implemented by combinations of half- and quarter - waveplates  @xcite  preferably zero - order waveplates  @xcite , for which the retardance is barely sensitive to deviation from the central frequency .",
    "that is to say , the action of waveplates , @xmath54 , can be assumed to be @xmath15-independent ( at least in the frequency range set by the interference filter before detection ) , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the elements of a unitary matrix that is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "we shall assume throughout this paper that unitary transformations by waveplates are ideal and independent of deviation from the central frequency .      a second method for creating arbitrary pure states is shown in fig .",

    "now , an arbitrary pure two - photon polarization state @xmath62 can be regarded as a superposition of two ( un - normalized ) parts : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the first part can be created from the ( un - normalized ) pump state @xmath65 . to create the second part",

    "the amplitude of each process , which is determined by the relative values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , can be adjusted by the transmission through the beam splitter . moreover ,",
    "coherent superposition can be achieved by balancing the two path lengths .",
    "thus , by combining a well - balanced interferometer and the process of spontaneous downconversion we can realize arbitrary two - photon polarization _",
    "pure _ states . in the next section",
    "we shall describe two schemes capable of producing arbitrary two - photon polarization _",
    "mixed _ states .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]      +",
    "any two - qubit mixed state can be canonically decomposed as follows  @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 are orthonormal eigenstates of @xmath72 .",
    "it is therefore natural to realize @xmath72 simply by mixing its eigenstates with probabilities proportional to their eigenvalues @xmath73 . as we can synthesize arbitrary pure states from one set of crystals , individual synthesis of each @xmath74 is straightforward .      the first mixed - state scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arbmixedsch1 ] .",
    "we have four pairs of nonlinear crystals , each generating a pure state that , when propagating to the output , arrives as @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "there is an attenuator in front of each set of crystals ( except the first set ) such that the pump intensity @xmath75 going into the @xmath76-th set of crystals is proportional to @xmath73 ( arranged in decreasing order : @xmath77 ) .",
    "it is less favorable to attenuate the four downconversion pure states to tune the probabilities according to their eigenvalues , because direct attenuation of the downconversion photons would , in general , result in unpaired photons , i.e. , one of the photons would be absorbed , but not the other  @xcite .    for a pulsed pump , the mixing is incoherent , as the arrival time of the downconversion pair ( relative to the pump pulse ) can , in principle , reveal information on where the pair was generated . for a cw ( continuous wave )",
    "pump , one can add a path delay ( much greater than the pump coherence length  @xcite ) , to each pair such that pair - generation amplitudes at all sets of crystals are no longer coherent with one another .",
    "we can thus synthesize @xmath72 by incoherently mixing its eigenstates with appropriate weights .",
    "as the downconversion process is much more likely to produce one rather than multiple pairs [ e.g. , see eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2ms ] ) ] , multiple pairs can be ignored .      the interferometric scheme of sec .",
    "[ sec : arbpuresch2 ] can also be extended to create arbitrary mixed states .",
    "the full scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arbmixedsch2 ] . the coherent superposition method of fig .",
    "[ fig : arbpuresch2 ] is used to create each of the four pure states @xmath74 in the decomposition  ( [ eqn : canonical ] ) and mix them incoherently in proportion to their eigenvalues @xmath73 , as in scheme  i. arbitrary weights of mixing can be achieved by controlling the transmissions of the beam splitters . in order to mix the four parts incoherently , we first use timing information  @xcite such that the state of the pump is @xmath78 here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( both un - normalized ) are the two parts of the pump state that will , ultimately , yield the corresponding pure state @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) encode timing information ; there is no coherence between paths labelled by distinct values of @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath83 . for this absence of coherence to hold ,",
    "the path - length difference between any two upper ( or lower ) unmatched paths must be greater than the pump coherence length  @xcite . as long as coherence",
    "is maintained for the corresponding pairs of states , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( for @xmath82 ) , but the time differences for the @xmath76 s are distinguishable , the output state is the desired mixed state , once timing information is traced over , i.e. , discarded  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that there is no difference in _ relative _ timing between signal and idler photons .",
    "the timing information is coupled solely to the pump photons ; because this timing information is traced over ( ignored ) , downconversion produces an incoherent mixture of four two - photon states . also note that with a cw pump , the only possibility to detect any coherence in the timing information would be to include similar unbalanced interferometers in the downconversion output .",
    "the difference between the present scheme ( ii ) and the previous one ( i ) is that for scheme  ii each of the four pure states is created probabilistically in the same downconversion crystals , whereas for scheme  i each of the four pure states is created in downconversion crystals at distinct locations .",
    "both schemes yield arbitrary two - qubit mixed states by incoherent temporal mixing .",
    "in this section we describe two reduced schemes ( iii and iv ) that provide practical ways to realize several important families of states that are currently of interest .",
    "scheme iii , whose feasibility has been demonstrated experimentally , emerges as an effort to reduce the number of downconversion crystals to two by sacrificing the generality of the synthesizable states .",
    "scheme  iv further extends the set of synthesizable states by employing two sets of crystals and the mixing technique introduced in scheme  i.      recall that scheme i requires the use of , at most , four sets of spdc crystals .",
    "since fewer crystal sets would be more economical and likely easier to implement , we thus propose a modified scheme , which uses only one set of spdc crystals but relies on `` controlled '' decoherence .",
    "although we do not yet know whether this scheme can generate _",
    "arbitrary _ two - qubit states , it can synthesize several important families of mixed states , including states with all physically allowed values of entanglement ( characterized , e.g. , by `` tangle '' ) and mixedness ( characterized , e.g. , by the linear entropy  @xcite ) .",
    "we use thick birefringent crystals with thickness @xmath84 as decoherers .",
    "their effect on a polarization state of definite frequency @xmath7 is ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath85 where the optic axis is assumed to be along , say , @xmath86 , i.e. , the @xmath39 direction , and @xmath87 is the refractive index for the @xmath88-th polarization state .",
    "the decohering elements entangle the polarization and frequency degrees of freedom . in the output ,",
    "only polarizations are detected , so we have to trace over the frequency degree of freedom in the joint pure state ( of polarizations and frequencies ) . in general ,",
    "we are then left with a _",
    "mixed _ two - photon polarization state . in the present scheme",
    ", we can have several decoherers in each arm , along with arbitrary unitary rotations between the decoherers ( only two are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redmixedsch1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to directly decohering the downconversion photons , one can also decohere the pump photons before downconversion , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : redmixedsch1 ] .",
    "however , as mentioned previously , the pump typically has a much longer coherence length than the downconversion photons do , and hence may require much greater relative birefringent delays , e.g. , unbalanced polarization interferometers , to achieve decoherence .    in the limit we are considering ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are respective thicknesses of the decoherers ) , decohering the pump in addition to the downconversion photons does not provide further control beyond simply decohering the downconversion photons .",
    "hence , in the following analysis we shall not consider decohering the pump .",
    "consider a pure initial polarization state of downconversion pairs  ( [ eqn : abcd ] ) : @xmath93 ( which is created by the method described in sec .",

    "( the family  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) also contains other maximally entangled mixed states , corresponding to different charaterizations of entanglement and entropy  @xcite . )",
    "although states in this family actually fill the physically allowed region of the tangle - entropy plane , this does not mean that the family contains all two - qubit mixed states .",
    "in fact , the family  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) has only 4 independent real parameters excluding the phase of the off - diagonal element . by including the 6 additional real parameters coming from the two arbitrary local @xmath56 transformations",
    ", we can thus control 10 of the 15 real parameters associated with general two - qubit mixed states .",
    "this assumes a _ single _ decoherer in each arm .",
    "the full capability of scheme  iii with an arbitrary number of decoherence stages is a difficult theoretical problem that requires further investigation .",
    "next we specifically describe how to generate maximally entangled mixed states , werner states , and a particular class of mixed states recently discussed by collins and gisin  @xcite .",

    "analogous procedures yield the other forms of the werner states , i.e. , with other maximally entangled components .    using these methods ,",
    "several maximally entangled mixed states and werner states have been synthesized experimentally , with high fidelities  @xcite between the experimentally produced states and the theoretical target states .",
    "for example , the mems @xmath120 was used to investigate entanglement purification protocols  @xcite , and the separable werner state @xmath121 was used to perform ancilla - assisted process tomography without entanglement  @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to the collins - gisin states , particular mixtures of two pure states : @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "collins and gisin reported a bell - like inequality ( which they call i3322 ) that is _ inequivalent _ to the usual chsh - bell inequality  @xcite , in that there are states that do not violate chsh but _ do _ violate i3322  @xcite .",
    "for example , the family of states @xmath124 exhibit this behavior for certain ranges of @xmath125 and @xmath46 where no violations of chsh occur .",
    "how can we create these collins - gisin states ?",
    "in light of the above examples of mems and werner states , we see that we only need to generate a pure state of the form @xmath126 followed by a decoherence with @xmath107 .",
    "such states have been experimentally realized and used to study various tests for entanglement and nonlocality  @xcite .",
    "states described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : d1 ] ) ( plus those derived from them by local unitary transformations ) are not the most general form that scheme  ii can achieve .",

    "this state does not belong to the family  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) , obtained with only one stage of decoherence , suggesting that using multiple decoherences may enable control over _ more _ than the 10 independent parameters allowed by a single decoherence .",
    "further theoretical investigation is needed to determine the most general states obtainable .",
    "from scheme  i it appears that one needs four sets of nonlinear crystals in order to synthesize fully general rank - four mixed states , whereas from scheme  iii one can create rank - four mixed states of the restricted form  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) ( up to local unitary transformations ) with a single set of crystals . as we now discuss , by using a hybrid scheme one can , with only two sets ( or in some cases , even just a single set ) of crystals , generate a larger class of rank - four mixed states .",
    "the idea is as follows .",

    "[ fig : redmixedsch2]a .",
    "although any two - qubit mixed state always allows a decomposition into a mixed state plus a pure part  @xcite , it remains an open question whether there always exists a decomposition for which the mixed - state part is achievable by scheme  iii .",
    "nevertheless , this hybrid scheme can obviously generate more states than scheme  iii alone , since adding the pure part adds more degrees of freedom .",
    "we can make a simple reckoning of the number of parameters of the achievable density matrices independently controllable .",
    "suppose we restrict the mixed - state part @xmath132 to be produced by scheme  iii with only one stage of decoherence , i.e. , @xmath132 is of the form  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) with all parameters real .",
    "recall that a general two - qubit pure state can be expressed as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are local unitary transformations , and @xmath137 and @xmath138 are schmidt coefficients",

    "it is clear that @xmath159 belongs to the family of states  ( [ eqn : d1 ] ) , and hence can be synthesized by scheme  iii with one stage of decoherence ; on the other hand , @xmath160 is a bell state , which can be easily generated .",
    "furthermore , the weight of @xmath159 is not less than that of @xmath161 , so there is no need to attenuate the intensity of the mixed part  @xcite .",
    "therefore , scheme iv can synthesize _ any _ bell - diagonal state @xmath162 .",
