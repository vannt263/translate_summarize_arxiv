    "observations of type 1a supernovae ( @xmath9 ) provide evidence for an accelerating expansion of the universe and dark energy .",
    "recent surveys have accumulated sufficient data that statistical uncertainties may be smaller than systematic ones .",
    "supernovae are imperfect standard candles , and systematic corrections for their absolute luminosity have evolved over time . besides a correction for time - stretch there is now a color ( @xmath10 ) correction parameter called @xmath11",
    ". fits to the cosmological model replace the observed magnitude @xmath12 by @xmath13 , representing the empirical fact that @xmath9 with bluer colors tend to be intrinsically brighter .",
    "after such redshift - independent corrections , cosmological parameters are fit using type 1a supernova data under a hypothesis that the cosmological model describes the data . despite the existence of publicly - accessible @xmath9 data",
    ", we find few independent tests of the assumption .",
    "as noted by vishwakarma ( 2011 ) , for the past few years studies with high statistics have focused on parameter estimation using methods that are not designed to test the model .",
    "here we pose simple and direct hypotheses tests comparing different models of @xmath9 magnitude corrections . in the existing null model",
    "the correction parameters @xmath14 for stretch , color and galaxy type have no redshift dependence .",
    "we compare that to a model using a two term taylor expansion @xmath15 .",
    "for the color parameter , the expansion is c ( z ) c=_0c+_1 ( c z- ) .",
    "[ colorz ]    we find the null model @xmath16 fails with high statistical significance .",
    "we call the empirical correlation the `` @xmath5 effect . ''",
    "it is related to previous hints of @xmath17 evolution with redshift discussed below .      before proceeding we",
    "consider malmquist ( magnitude ) selection bias and `` other '' selection bias .",
    "the bias that observing higher redshift @xmath9 tends to select a brighter population is well known . a proper test",
    "is not concerned with the absolute magnitudes directly , but instead with the _ differences _ between the systematically corrected data and the cosmological model . when we extend parameters @xmath18 it stands on the same testable footing as testing redshift dependence of the dark matter and dark energy density parameters .",
    "moreover , while a population bias may still contribute to the `` lever arm '' of fitting parameters , it should not make a true model fitting the data appear to be false .",
    "regarding other , unspecified `` bias '' as explanation for the effects we find : we regard that as fair game .",
    "when bias exists it needs to be explored , while the business of testing hypotheses is itself neutral on the interpretation .",
    "we use the 580 points of the union 2.1 compilation ( suzuki et al .",
    "2012 , henceforth s12 ) to test the current model .",

    "we believe that transparent and reproducible data analysis is of intrinsic value , and deliberately avoid statistically elaborate methods .",
    "nevertheless we have reproduced the analysis elements of our main references which are reproducible with the data that has been published .",
    "the comparison of our independent study with those produced with data compendia focused on cosmological parameter estimation should be a reason to extend those analyses to include redshift dependent parameters .",

    "the data tables reported only magnitude uncertainties , omitting the systematic errors , which are much larger .",
    "we found a large correlation of @xmath42 and the residuals of the 307 point ` 3@xmath4 set' defined in the paper .",
    "one @xmath1 parameter @xmath43 also yielded a difference @xmath44 , using the raw uncertainties .",
    "next we studied the union 2.0 compilation of 557 @xmath9 ( amanullah et al .",

    "this paper ( and all we discuss here ) used parametrically - fit errors @xmath117 as discussed below .",
    "within such a procedure k08 noted a bias in fitting @xmath11 , as suggested earlier by wang et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "( kessler et al .",
    "2009 , henceforth k09 ) and lago et al ( 2012 ) also found @xmath11 decreasing with @xmath24 in bin - by - bin fits , and mentioned a possible signal of supernova evolution .",
    "after finding @xmath11 again decreasing bin - by - bin with larger @xmath24 , ( guy et al .",
    "2010 , henceforth g10 ) explored uncertainties in @xmath118 .",

    "actually the issues were not cleanly resolved with g10 stating that `` we are not able to conclude on an evolution of @xmath119 with redshift ''",
    ".    fits to binned data can be suggestive , but they dilute the statistical weight and should include statistical penalties depending on the number of parameters .",
    "our one - parameter approach uses no binning , and is able to discriminate between parameter bias and correlation . to illustrate this , we repeated simulations of our data generated from a fixed cosmology with no corrections other than @xmath120 , plus random noise .",

    "that value is comparable to the @xmath129 shown for 307 union points in fig.5 of k08 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath11 is a topic of great interest .",
    "very recently scolnic et al ( 2013 ) directly confront the question of @xmath119-bias , and find that the combination of residual scatter due to color and a realistic color distribution will bias @xmath119 by roughly one unit lower than its true value .",
    "that work builds on chotard et al ( 2011 ) who suggest that the controversy over type 1a colors can be explained by the dispersion in colors , and by variable features observable in the spectra .",
    "however neither the bias nor the value of @xmath11 is relevant to our particular task .",
    "the distribution of @xmath130 from the simulations directly tests our methods independent of the bias .",

    "the same was found when we made color noise increase linearly with @xmath24 .",
    "we are not aware of any previous studies that compared hypotheses using @xmath135 and global @xmath6 fits .",
    "there is a question whether systematic error assignments might cause a false correlation .",
    "our results for unweighted residuals @xmath51 and @xmath136 using raw magnitude tends to contradict that possibility .",
    "we considered adjusting systematic errors to banish the @xmath5 effect , but soon realized it would be irresponsible . to explore systematic errors in an unbiased way we padded magnitude errors @xmath137 by the rule @xmath138 , and adjusted parameter @xmath139 .",
    "the range of @xmath139 spanned the differences of @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "the procedure tests whether points of small error might skew results without unfairly adjusting errors to fit the @xmath142 model .",

    "the result disfavors systematic error assignments causing the correlation .",
    "we have focused on analysis based on errors as they are published , both for simplicity and so that our results can be reproduced .",
    "the recent compendia ( k08 , a10 , s12 , etc . ) compute the errors by parametrically fitting error functions @xmath149 to the cosmological model .",

    "the value very strongly disfavors the null model .",
    "we doubt such a large change in @xmath3 would be due to the ( assumed small ) unpublished off - diagonal elements of color fitting , but if so it would cast a new light on the entire procedure of parametrically - fit errors .",

    "( italics are ours . )",
