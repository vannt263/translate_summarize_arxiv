    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are the least luminous , least massive galaxies known .",
    "they are defined morphologically in terms of their low surface brightnesses , elliptical shapes , and relatively smooth distributions of stars . in galaxy groups ,",
    "the dsph galaxies most frequently are found within @xmath2 kpc of more massive galaxies , while dsphs exist in large numbers as independent members of galaxy clusters .",
    "they have total masses as low as @xmath3 m@xmath1 , @xmath4 mag , @xmath5 mag arcsec@xmath6 , and diameters ( from tidal radii ) of @xmath7 to @xmath8  kpc .",
    "their projected radial light profiles are shallow and can be fit by a range of different profile types , including exponentials .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are usually devoid of gas and dominated by old and intermediate - age stars , although some have experienced small amounts of recent star formation .",
    "even though dsphs can appear to be quite flattened , the galactic dsph satellites are known not to be rotationally supported , a trend that extends to many , but not all ( e.g. , pedraz et al . 2002 ) , members of the structurally similar , more massive dwarf elliptical ( de ) family . whether lack of rotational support is a general characteristic of dsphs is not yet known . for reviews of dsph properties",
    "see , e.g. , gallagher & wyse ( 1994 ) , grebel ( 1997 , 1999 , 2000 ) , da costa ( 1998 ) , mateo ( 1998 ) , and van den bergh ( 1999a , 2000 ) .",
    "properties of des are reviewed by ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) .",
    "the dsphs are fascinating galaxies .",
    "they combine low densities of luminous matter , predilections for locations in dense cosmic environments , in some cases high apparent total mass densities , and recently recognized complex star formation histories .",
    "three general classes of models have been suggested for the origins of dsph galaxies : tidal interactions that transform field disk galaxies into spheroidal systems ( e.g. , sofue 1994 ; mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , processes associated with the birth of small systems , especially in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model ( dekel & silk 1986 ) , and fragments liberated during collisions between larger galaxies ( gerola , carnevali , & salpeter 1983 ) .",
    "these models are not necessarily independent of one another ; e.g. , dwarfs may form via the collapse of cdm and then evolve through tidal interactions . while this paper does not study the formation or early evolution of galaxies that may become dsphs",
    ", we will discuss whether multiple evolutionary paths might have dsphs as their end points .",
    "unfortunately , these perspectives on the origins of dsphs face well - known difficulties .",
    "for example , standard cdm models overpredict the fraction of dwarfs which should be dsphs ; the issue in this case is why we do not see even more examples of this class of galaxy ( e.g. , klypin et al .  1999 ; moore et al . 1999",
    "; bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) . simple gas loss or passive evolution to gas exhaustion can not make a rotating dirr into a non - rotating dsph ( e.g. , binggeli 1986 ) .",
    "while the tidal model allows angular momentum to be lost , it offers neither a ready explanation for the existence of isolated dsphs , such as the tucana or cetus dwarfs , nor a simple physical basis for the dsph mass - metallicity correlation ( see section [ sect_lz ] ) . more generally ,",
    "if passive evolution leads to gas exhaustion , we wonder why so few dwarf galaxies exist with a combination of old stars and neutral gas , as might be expected if star formation stops at some critical gas density threshold ( phillipps , edmunds & davies 1990 ) .",
    "while dsphs and dirrs show similar trends of global properties with luminosity , the dsphs are more metal - rich than dirrs at the same optical luminosity . this difference is observed both for abundances in planetary nebulae and for stellar metal abundances , which we denote as `` [ fe / h ] '' ( e.g. , skillman & bender 1995 ; richer , mccall , & stasinska 1998 ; mateo 1998 , and references therein ) , and stands as an argument against evolution from dirrs to dsphs .",
    "low mass galaxies , including dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) and dsphs show similar exponential radial brightness profiles ( lin & faber 1983 ; kormendy 1985 ) , which has been interpreted as an indication that these could be different versions of the same basic type of galaxy . in this case",
    "another mechanism , such as tides , is required to produce spheroidal systems from objects that formed as disk galaxies .",
    "tidal fragment models for dsphs face different types of difficulties , such as explaining the apparent lack of extratidal stars , the highly symmetric structure , and the high dark matter content of some dsph systems , such as draco ( e.g. , odenkirchen et al .  2001",
    "; see also kleyna ey al.2002 for arguments based on a kinematic study ) . note that another very nearby dsph , ursa minor ( table 1 ) shows considerable indications of ongoing tidal disruption ( e.g. , martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) , showing that at least some dsphs do experience this .",
    "another key aspect of dsphs is how they achieve their present gas - poor states ( e.g. , skillman & bender 1995 ) . in order to have formed stars , all dsphs must",
    "once have contained significant amounts of gas .",
    "however , it is unclear what their progenitors were and how the transformation from gas - rich to gas - free galaxies proceeded .",
    "one possibility is that the gas - deficient nature of dsphs is closely associated with their births , e.g. , as a result of special effects associated with their rapid early collapse , as predicted by cdm galaxy formation models ( e.g. , chiu , gnedin , & ostriker 2001 ) . alternatively",
    ", dsphs could result from the transformation of low mass galaxies as predicted by models invoking tidal distortion and ram pressure stripping of objects orbiting near giant systems ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the implications of mean stellar population metal abundances and hi gas contents of nearby low - mass dwarf galaxies , although we include more massive dwarfs when considering trends in physical properties .",
    "we pay particular attention to the `` transition - type dwarf galaxies '' , the dirr / dsphs .",
    "these objects combine properties associated with dsphs ( such as low luminosities and prominent old stellar populations ) with those of dirrs ( such as hi gas ) .",
    "the dirr / dsphs therefore may hold clues to the nature of relationships between these two galaxy classes .",
    "in particular we explore whether dirr / dsph systems could be hybrid objects that merely combine features of dirr and dsph galaxies , or whether they might be in an evolutionary transition from dirr types towards dsphs ( or possibly the reverse ; see silk , wyse , & shields 1987 ) .",
    "in section [ sect_data ] we describe observational and derived data on mean stellar chemical abundances and hi gas masses of dwarf galaxies in the local group and its surroundings , which form the basis of our analysis . in section [ sect_lz ] the luminosity - metallicity relation for gas - rich dirr , transition - type dirr / dsph , and gas - free dsph galaxies is discussed .",
    "properties of individual transition - type galaxies and selected dsphs are discussed in section [ sect_simil ] , which describes their similarities with respect to lack of rotation and star formation histories .",
    "section [ sect_removal ] briefly reviews mechanisms that can remove gas from dwarf galaxies , an essential precondition for producing dsphs . in section [ sect_conc ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "for this investigation we compiled a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies , whose resolved stellar populations were studied through deep ground - based observations or through hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging .",
    "we adopted a generous definition for dwarfs , and consider galaxies with @xmath9 mag to be potential members of this structural class ( gallagher 1998 ; grebel 1999 ) .",
    "we included all known and suspected local group members that lie within a zero - velocity radius of 1.2 mpc ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) around the barycenter of the local group , which yields 33 dwarf and satellite galaxies in addition to the three local group spirals .",
    "the four possible members of the small , nearby sextans - antlia group ( van den bergh 1999b ) were added as well .",
    "if sextans - antlia is indeed a physical group , then it is extremely poor , consisting only of dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we added three isolated dwarfs in the nearby field . in total",
    ", our sample of dwarf galaxies in and around the local group contains 40 objects , and includes the magellanic clouds , dirrs , transition - class dirr / dsphs , dsphs , and des .",
    "table 1 lists some optical and hi properties of this sample .",
    "horizontal lines separate spatially defined galaxy subgroups : the first set of galaxies are possible or likely companions of the milky way , the second companions of m31 , the third more distant possible local group members , the fourth possible members of the sextans - antlia group , and the fifth are seemingly isolated galaxies in the nearby field .",
    "column 1 gives the dwarf galaxy names , column 2 their types ( see table comments for details ) , columns 3 and 4 their j2000 coordinates , column 5 heliocentric distances based largely on the tip of the red giant branch , column 6 the distance to the nearest `` parent '' galaxy ( omitted for milky way satellites ) or to the barycenter ( subscript ` bary ' ) of the local group .",
    "column 7 specifies absolute @xmath10-band magnitudes , column 8 central @xmath10-band surface brightnesses , column 9 mean metallicity and metallicity spread ( not uncertainty ) , column 10 the hi mass , and column 11 the @xmath10-band luminosity .",
    "literature references are given in the table comments .      in order to ensure that we compare the chemical abundances of equivalent stellar populations in dirrs , transition - types , and dsphs",
    ", we concentrate here on the estimated mean stellar [ fe / h ] values of old populations .",
    "old stellar populations have been detected in each dirr , transition - type , and dsph studied to sufficiently faint magnitudes .",
    "we neglect nebular @xmath11-element abundances measured in hii regions or planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the former refer to the _ present - day _ gas abundances of young populations .",
    "the latter form from progenitor stars with masses @xmath12 and ages @xmath13 years , but can not be readily associated with any specific age stellar population . since young metal - rich populations will produce more pne than older , metal - poor populations , luminous pne help to probe the interstellar medium oxygen abundances at the epoch when star formation last occurred once certain corrections are applied ( richer , mccall , & arimoto 1997 ) . however ,",
    "pne have been detected so far in only two dsphs .",
    "another problem arises from variations in the iron - peak to @xmath11-element abundances , which depend on prior star formation histories modulated by the details of gas loss mechanisms ( e.g. , burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 ; recchi , matteucci , & dercole 2001 ) .",
    "hence we consider here only the mean metallicities of old stellar populations , which can be approximately measured in a consistent manner in both types of galaxies .    for old stellar populations in dsphs and dirrs a large metallicity data set has become available in recent years based on spectroscopic and photometric abundance determinations for red giants .",
    "spectroscopic measurements have been carried out for individual red giants in a number of nearby dwarfs ( e.g. , suntzeff et al .",
    "1993 ; ct , oke , & cohen 1999 ; bonifacio et al .",
    "2000 ; guhathakurta , reitzel , & grebel 2000 ; shetrone , ct , & sargent 2001 ; tolstoy et al.2001 ; shetrone et al .",
    "2003 ; smecker - hane , bosler , & stetson 2003 ; smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2003 ) .",
    "photometric metallicity estimates can be applied over much larger distances , and are largely based on the empirical calibration by da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) and more recent refinements ( e.g. , lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the photometric methods use either the slope of the red giant branch in comparison with globular cluster fiducials or the mean @xmath14 color at a certain absolute @xmath15-band magnitude for old stellar populations .",
    "the absolute @xmath15-band magnitude is chosen such that contamination by asymptotic giant branch stars is reduced while measuring at a luminosity where the mean color is still sensitive to metallicity .",
    "this results in metallicities on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) [ fe / h ] scale , in good agreement with spectroscopic results .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the photometric estimates is approximately @xmath16 dex in galaxies where old stars dominate the red giant branch , while the relative accuracy is largely determined by photometric uncertainties and can be higher .",
    "an important caveat of the photometric methods is the problem of the age - metallicity degeneracy in mixed populations : evolved stars belonging to intermediate - age populations overlap with the blue part of the red giant branch and may make the red giant branch appear more metal - poor than it really is .",
    "synthetic color - magnitude - diagram modelling helps to reduce this degeneracy if all the various age tracers in a color - magnitude diagram are properly taken into account ( e.g. , holtzman , smith , & grillmair 2000 ) .",
    "also , measurements based on red giant branches in the outer regions of dirrs , where old populations dominate ( e.g. , minniti & zijlstra 1996 ; harbeck et al .",
    "2001 ) , reduce contamination effects .",
    "still , spectroscopy is the only way to unambiguously resolve the age - metallicity degeneracy for individual stars .    in table 1",
    "we list [ fe / h ] abundance estimates based on the resolved red giant branches of nearby dwarf galaxies through intrinsically consistent methods ( spectroscopy where available , and otherwise photometric estimates ) .",
    "the @xmath17 values quoted for [ fe / h ] refer to the estimated abundance spread across the red giant branch in these galaxies , not to the uncertainty in the [ fe / h ] determination .",
    "we used optical @xmath10-band luminosities ( @xmath18 ) for the galaxies in our sample ( table 1 ) . in gas - free dsphs",
    "all of the identified baryonic mass is in stars , whereas some of the baryonic matter in other dwarf galaxies is still in the form of gas . to put all dwarfs on a comparable baryon content scale",
    ", we calculated the `` baryonic luminosity '' @xmath19 as defined by matthews , van driel , & gallagher ( 1998 ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the hi mass , the factor 1.33 accounts for the presence of helium , and @xmath22 is the mean mass - to - luminosity ratio for the galaxy s stellar population in the @xmath10-band .",
    "we assumed a constant stellar population mass to light ratio of 2 to derive the equivalent luminosity of the gas .",
    "this is a conservative estimate for a fading stellar population ( e.g. , charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ; schulz et al .",
    "thus @xmath19 predicts the approximate luminosity that a dirr galaxy would have at the point where it would have converted all of its gas into stars and had begun to fade .    for dwarf galaxies with significant amounts of interstellar matter",
    ", we used the hi fluxes listed in mateo ( 1998 ) or more recent publications ( see table comments ) together with the distances listed in table 1 to calculate the hi masses via the standard relation @xmath23 ( e.g. , knapp , kerr , & williams 1978 ) . here",
    "@xmath24 is the galaxy distance in mpc and @xmath25 is the total 21-cm line flux in jy km s@xmath26 .",
    "we revisit the dwarf galaxy hi content issue in section  4.2 .",
    "sensitive searches for hi within the tidal radii of dsphs resulted in upper column density limits of only a few @xmath27 cm@xmath6 ( young 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the only exception is the sculptor dsph , where hi with peak column densities of @xmath29 cm@xmath6 was detected within the tidal radius ( carignan et al .",
    "1998 ) . while location and radial velocity of the hi support its association with sculptor",
    ", this gas may be part of a larger , unassociated complex merely seen in projection ( carignan 1999 ) .    for gas - deficient dwarf galaxies upper limits",
    "are listed .",
    "where available these upper limit masses are derived from hi line flux limits in the recent literature ( see table comments for references ) , and re - calculated assuming that the hi fills the optical extent of these dwarf galaxies within their tidal radius at uniform gas column density .",
    "this assumption was made because the gas in dwarf galaxies usually is at least as extended as their optically visible bodies . in dirrs",
    "the hi may be several times more extended than the optical galaxy ( see grebel 2002 for a review and references ) .",
    "non - detections of hi usually occur in low - mass dwarfs that are within 300 kpc of more massive galaxies .",
    "their hi content , if present at all , may be truncated in its spatial extent due to ram pressure effects caused by the massive galaxy s gaseous corona , or by tidal effects ( see section [ sect_removal ] ) .",
    "hence the use of the tidal radius appears to be a reasonable compromise in these gas - deficient objects .",
    "we did not take into account detections of possibly associated hi _",
    "well beyond _ the optical radius of some dsphs ( section [ sect_ram ] ) .",
    "the comment `` undet . '' refers to dsphs that were not detected in the northern leiden - dwingeloo survey ( blitz & robishaw 2000 ) or in the southern hipass survey ( huchtmeier , karachentsev , & karachentseva 2001 ) , and for which no specific hi flux limits were published .",
    "dwarf galaxies follow a well - known luminosity  metallicity relation : the more luminous a dwarf , the higher its mean metallicity ( e.g. , grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ) .",
    "higher luminosities usually imply higher masses and deeper gravitational potential wells , and/or higher luminous matter densities , and/or high recent star formation rates . in return , the more luminous galaxies may undergo stronger enrichment and , due to their deeper potential wells , also have an improved ability to retain the metals ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "if dsphs and dirrs are distinguished only by evolution induced by their environments after formation , then we might expect their older stellar populations to be similar .",
    "the older stars in both systems presumably formed under similar conditions , before the dsph and dirr evolutionary paths diverge .",
    "differentiation by ram pressure stripping alone is a simple example of this class of model .",
    "the dsph systems would evolve like their dirr cousins until gas is removed , but before gas loss , the two classes of galaxies would be similar .",
    "comparisons of chemical abundances in older stellar populations therefore can provide powerful evolutionary tracers .    a plot of @xmath10-band luminosity @xmath18 versus @xmath30 \\rangle$ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lz ] , left panel ) shows a clear trend of increasing luminosity with increasing mean red giant branch metallicity for the dsphs ( filled circles ) , which appears to extend to the more luminous des ( open circles ) .",
    "the dirrs ( open diamonds ) show a similar trend , but are offset from the locus of the dsphs in that they are more luminous at the same metallicity ( see also mateo 1998 and references therein ) .    in other words ,",
    "the dirrs have too low a metallicity for their luminosity as compared to dsphs .",
    "thus dsphs , most of which have been quiescent over at least the past few gyr , must have experienced chemical enrichment faster and more efficiently than dirrs , which continue to form stars until the present day .",
    "_ this is a fundamental difference between dsphs and dirrs .",
    "_ plausible progenitors of present - day dsphs would need to have undergone similarly rapid early evolution .    when plotting the baryonic luminosity against metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_lz ] , right panel ) , the locus of the dsphs remains unchanged while the dirrs move to higher luminosities as compared to the dsphs .",
    "thus if star formation in present - day dirrs were terminated when all of their gas was converted into stars , then these fading dirrs would be even further from the dsph luminosity - metallicity relationship unless substantial chemical enrichment occurs in a long - lived stellar population that would produce a strong red giant branch .",
    "figure [ fig_lz ] shows that present - day dsphs are at least by a factor of 10 fainter in luminosity than present - day dirrs at the same stellar metallicity ( i.e. , for the old stellar population ) .",
    "models presented by charlot , worthey , & bressan ( 1996 ) show that for a galaxy to homologously fade by this amount  roughly 2 magnitudes in @xmath31  an interval of @xmath32 gyr after the cessation of star formation is required .",
    "in other words , present - day dirrs would need another hubble time to turn into dsphs if for some reason all star formation were to cease now . for cases where",
    "cessation of star formation also is associated with loss of stars , e.g. , in cases of tidal stripping , an even larger decline in surface brightness should occur ( e.g. , mayer et al .",
    "on the other hand , if star formation were to continue at a low level , as is expected to occur well into the future in most dirrs , due to their modest star formation rates and large gas reservoirs ( hunter 1997 ) , the fading time scale would increase .    at the same absolute magnitude ,",
    "dirrs tend to have lower surface brightnesses than dsphs ( figure [ fig_surf_mv_feh ] ) .",
    "if they were to stop forming stars , fading by one magnitude in absolute brightness would also imply a decrease in surface brightness by roughly this amount ( hunter & gallagher 1985 ) as indicated by the arrow in figure [ fig_surf_mv_feh ] .",
    "for the majority of nearby dirrs fading would thus result in galaxies with too low a surface brightness as compared to present - day dsphs . a few dirrs ( notably gr8 and sagdig ) as well as the three transition - type dwarfs for which",
    "surface brightnesses have been measured ( lgs3 , ddo210 , and kkr25 ) would , however , continue to coincide with the dsph locus in figure [ fig_surf_mv_feh ] .",
    "in addition to the issues of fading and rapid early enrichment , many dirrs , and especially the more massive systems , would also need to find a mechanism to lose their angular momentum and their gas if they are to become dsphs .",
    "we can not consider most normal present - day dirrs , which are not close satellites of giant galaxies , as likely precursors of dsphs over any reasonable time scale ( see also binggeli 1986 , 1994 ) .      dwarf galaxies classified as possible dirr / dsph transition - types in the literature are marked by filled diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig_lz ] .",
    "five of these , namely phoenix , ddo210 , lgs3 , antlia , and kkr25 , lie in the area of our diagram occupied by the dsphs . in the @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 } \\rangle$ ] diagram they outline the luminous edge of the dsph locus .",
    "their hi masses are typically a few times @xmath0 @xmath35 , while dirrs have hi masses @xmath36 @xmath35 .",
    "the sixth potential transition - type galaxy , pegdig , is found in the region of fig .",
    "[ fig_lz ] occupied by the dirrs . two metal - poor , faint dirrs lie close to the dsph locus in the @xmath18 , @xmath30 \\rangle$ ] diagram : gr8 and leoa .",
    "they move closer to the dirr locus when @xmath33 is plotted instead , although since leo  a has a dominant moderately young stellar population ( tolstoy et al .",
    "1998 ) , its stellar [ fe / h ] may be underestimated ( cf .",
    "schulte - ladbeck et al .  2002 ) .",
    "we also tentatively exclude the pegdig from the transition group due to the nature and level of its star - forming activity and substantial interstellar medium ( see section [ sect_difftransstage ] ) .",
    "the locations of phoenix , ddo210 , lgs3 , and antlia on the luminosity - metallicity plane indicate that these galaxies would closely resemble the classic dsph galaxies if they were to lose their gas .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath18 , @xmath30 \\rangle$ ] diagram they would be essentially indistinguishable from dsphs . in this sense , we may consider these four transition galaxies as present - day progenitors of dsph galaxies , whose properties ( other than gas content and associated recent star formation ) are fully consistent with the properties of dsphs .",
    "however , given the reasonable hi contents and low star formation rates of these galaxies , they are not rapidly evolving .",
    "the nearby transition - type galaxies appear to close the gap between the late - type and early - type dwarf galaxies at the low - luminosity end , possibly even indicating the existence of a continuum of faint , low - mass dwarf galaxies between the dirr and dsph morphological classes .",
    "are the overall properties of transition - type galaxies consistent with their being progenitors of dsph galaxies ?      if the ratio of rotational velocity @xmath37 versus velocity dispersion @xmath17 is @xmath38 , random motions rather than rotation dominate ( e.g. , lo , sargent , & young 1993 ) .",
    "this appears to be the case for all dsphs whose stellar kinematics have been studied to date .",
    "in contrast to more massive dirrs , most of the low - mass dirr and dirr / dsph galaxies show little evidence for rotational support ; e.g. , gr8 , leoa , lgs3 , sagdig , and ddo210 do not display systematic rotation in their hi gas ( lo et al .",
    "1993 ; young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "the hi cloud apparently associated with phoenix has a small velocity gradient that may either be due to rotation ( @xmath39 ) or due to ejection from the galaxy ( st - germain et al .",
    "pegdig also has @xmath39 ( lo et al .",
    "no such data are available yet for antlia and kkr25 . these hi velocity field measurements are consistent with either no ordered circular motion or very low levels of rotation ( @xmath40 5  km  s@xmath26 ) , supporting close kinship between dsphs and dirr / dsphs , although obviously observations of _ stellar _ kinematics are essential to confirm this point .",
    "the need for further measurements of stellar velocities to constrain rotation also applies to many of the local group dsphs ( e.g. , the m31 dsph companions ) .      plotting the hi masses in table 1 versus distance from the closest massive galaxy ( column 5 in table 1 ) , we see a tendency for hi masses to increase with galactocentric distance ( figure [ fig_dist_mhi ] ) .",
    "this trend was also noticed by blitz & robishaw ( 2000 ) , who confirmed the finding by knapp , kerr , & bowers ( 1978 ) that for dsphs hi mass upper limits fall well below 10@xmath41 m@xmath1 . only fairly large galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds , ic10 , and m33 , with hi masses @xmath42   m@xmath1 , seem to be able to retain their gas reservoirs when closer than @xmath43  kpc to giants .",
    "we note that weak lensing measurements and dynamical modelling indicate typical dark matter halo scales of @xmath44 ( e.g. , mckay et al .",
    "2002 ) , of similar order as the distance range discussed here .",
    "these hi - rich satellite galaxies are at least two orders of magnitude more massive than the dsphs . the one transition - type galaxy within this distance range of a larger neighbor is antlia , which is believed to be tidally interacting with ngc3109 ( section [ sect_tidal ] ) .    beyond distances of @xmath45250  kpc from the two local group giant galaxies ,",
    "a number of dirrs and transition - type galaxies with substantial hi mass fractions are found . while the absence of such galaxies at smaller distances seems consistent with expectations from a distance - dependent ram pressure / tidal stripping scenario",
    "( see also section [ sect_external ] ) , we note that dirrs and dsphs are seen throughout the local group , although very few dsphs are known at distances @xmath46  kpc are known .",
    "environment can not be the only factor responsible for the origin of dsph galaxies ( see also tamura & hirashita 1999 ) .",
    "detections of possibly associated hi clouds at distances of @xmath47 kpc from the optical centers of five dsphs were reported by blitz & robishaw ( 2000 ; cf .",
    "oosterloo , da costa , & staveley - smith 1996 ) .",
    "could these be former dirr / dsphs , which were stripped recently ?    for andromedav , the claim of physically associated gas can be excluded due to a difference between the optical and hi radial velocity ( guhathakurta , reitzel , & grebel 2000 ) .",
    "the recent high - resolution hi study by robishaw , simon , & blitz ( 2002 ) shows that the detection reported near leoi is kinematically distinct from this galaxy .",
    "the authors suggest , however , that this cloud may be tidally interacting with leoi . matching the hi cloud seen projected in the vicinity of tucana to this galaxy",
    "requires a measurement of an optical velocity , which is still missing .",
    "oosterloo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) consider it more likely that this cloud is either a high - velocity cloud or part of the magellanic stream .",
    "the remaining two hi detections have velocities similar to the optical radial velocities of the adjacent dsphs , andiii ( guhathakurta et al .",
    "2000 ) and sextans , which may indicate a connection with these dsphs , although the caveat of possible confusion with intergalactic gas clouds should be kept in mind .",
    "none of the three dsphs with possibly associated hi ( andiii , sextans , tucana ) contains either prominent intermediate - age ( @xmath48 gyr ) populations or young stars .",
    "the distances of these three dsphs from the closest spiral galaxy are @xmath49 kpc ( andiii ) , @xmath50 kpc ( sextans ) , and @xmath51 kpc ( tucana ) ; distance is not the common factor .",

    "are indistinguishable from other dsphs .",
    "their existence demonstrates that present - day environment can not be the only factor responsible for the existence of dsph galaxies .",
    "observations and theory appear to agree in predicting that most dwarf galaxies should be able to retain a reasonable fraction of their primordial gas supplies .",
    "if evolution from transition - type dwarfs to dsphs is to occur , then effective mechanisms must exist to remove interstellar gas . in the following",
    "we briefly review several possible gas removal mechanisms .        while star formation may certainly lead to galactic winds and significant metal losses from dwarf galaxies , numerical models",
    "indicate that star formation is unlikely to be a generally valid agent for the _ complete _ removal of gas .",
    "stellar - powered blow - away of the entire interstellar medium is predicted to occur only in galaxies with total masses below @xmath63 m@xmath1 ( burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 ; hirashita 1999 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; andersen & burkert 2000 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) . however , no galaxies with such low total masses are known .",
    "the inferred total masses of dsphs comfortably exceed this limit , assuming that they contain dark matter ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "the assumption of internal virialisation leads to essentially the same estimated dynamical mass for all galactic dsphs ( @xmath64 m@xmath1 ; gallagher & wyse 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , neither the transition - type dwarfs nor the dsphs show compelling evidence for the major starbursts needed to produce large - scale gas blow - outs in their star formation histories ( to the extent that such events would be resolvable ) . in particular , there is no evidence of dsphs whose star formation terminated after a major starburst . with the exception of the clearly episodic star formation history of the carina dsph ( smecker - hane 1997 ; hurley - keller , mateo , & nemec 1998 ) , the star formation histories of dsphs are consistent with fairly continuous star formation whose rate subsided at recent times ( see grebel 1999 ; 2000 for reviews ) .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of dwarf galaxies with apparently similar masses to those of the dsphs , but with substantial hi gas reservoirs ( e.g. , lgs3 , ddo210 , and kkr25 ; table 1 ) .",
    "moreover , the large metallicity spreads observed in a number of dsphs that are dominated by ancient star formation episodes ( shetrone et al .  2001 , 2003 ; ikuta & arimoto 2002 ; carigi , hernandez & gilmore 2002 ) as well as radial gradients in old populations ( harbeck et al .",
    "2001 ) indicate that dsphs were not only able to hold on to a significant amount of the metals that they produced , but also experienced extended ancient star formation episodes .",
    "recent detailed analyses of the age - metallicity evolution favor leaky - box models ( e.g. , smecker - hane & mcwilliam 2003 ) or even closed - box models ( e.g. , tolstoy et al .  2003 ) .",
    "davies & phillips ( 1988 ) suggest that the gas in dsphs was consumed completely by star formation . however , star formation efficiencies are usually fairly low , typically in the range from 1% to 9% per event in galactic giant molecular clouds ( carpenter 2000 ) .",
    "even though upper limits for the efficiency of low - mass star formation may reach 30% to 50% when the effects of massive stars are neglected ( matzner & mckee 2000 ) , one expects to find that much of the gas remains after stars form .",
    "thus we observe the common pattern where the mass of interstellar gas exceeds that of recently formed stars .",
    "furthermore , in order for star formation to occur , the gas density probably must exceed some critical value to produce gravitationally bound gas clouds where stars can condense .",
    "galaxies with low gas pressure are dominated by warm neutral interstellar matter ( ism ; with temperatures @xmath65 k ) .",
    "the gas can cool down and form molecular clouds only in regions with localized high pressure . in absence of shear and density waves",
    ", turbulence may locally lead to long - lived clumps with higher density ( elmegreen & hunter 2000 ) . in this model",
    "the condensation of stars occurs in local density peaks and ceases once the gas density becomes lower than some critical threshold for gravitational collapse ( van zee et al .",
    "this results in low global efficiency , scattered star formation that can not consume all of the available star - forming gas .",
    "a dwarf galaxy left on its own therefore should evolve into an object with little or no active star formation , even though significant amounts residual gas would remain ( e.g. , see models of carraro et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the absence of detectable amounts of interstellar gas in dsphs is surprising since the slow replenishment of the ism naturally will occur due to mass ejected from stars in the course of their evolution .",
    "stellar population models with normal initial mass mass functions and low metallicities show that stellar mass loss rates decline as the population ages , scaling approximately as @xmath66 at late times ( e.g. , jungwiert , combes , & paulou 2001 ) . the schulz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) simple stellar population models give a total mass return of @xmath67 5% of the present day stellar mass in a system that is passively aging from 412  gyr after its formation .",

    "detectable amounts of hi then should build up in dsphs in at most a few gyr if stellar mass loss is retained and becomes neutral ( young 2000 ) . yet",
    "this is not observed .",
    "hence we face two substantial questions : how and why did dsph progenitors lose their initial supplies of gas ? what prevented their refilling with gas lost by stars to the point where they could be detected in the recent , sensitive 21  cm hi line surveys ( see also sections [ sect_external ] , [ sect_ion ] ) ?",

    "ram pressure stripping is favored by proximity to giant galaxies , where halo gas densities may already exceed @xmath75 @xmath74 at distances of several tens of kpc ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "2002 ) , and where relative orbital velocities will be highest .    is the dsph fornax ( section [ sect_difftransstage ] ) then a galaxy that could have experienced ram pressure stripping recently ?",
    "piatek et al .  (",
    "2002 ) suggest that fornax is close to perigalacticon , that it has a large tangential velocity ( @xmath76 km s@xmath26 ) , and that may not be bound to the milky way . while the uncertainties of the proper motion measurement are still large , we use the resulting space velocity of fornax , its stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath77 km s@xmath26 ( mateo 1998 ) , and @xmath78 @xmath74 to estimate the internal average gas density below which ram pressure stripping could have occurred : we find @xmath79 @xmath74 , corresponding to an average column density of @xmath80 cm@xmath6 .",
    "we note that the igm gas density is a conservative upper limit considering that fornax is at @xmath81 times the distance of the magellanic stream .",
    "moreover , fornax negative galactocentric radial velocity indicates that is still approaching perigalacticon and has not yet passed through denser parts of the galactic halo .",
    "hence it appears questionable whether ram pressure stripping through a homogeneous gaseous medium could have removed fornax gas so efficiently .",
    "internal gas densities differ from dwarf galaxy to dwarf galaxy . in phoenix ,",
    "the _ peak _ hi column density is a few times @xmath82 cm@xmath6 or @xmath83 @xmath74 . in low - mass dirrs and",
    "dsphs the internal velocity dispersions are @xmath84 km s@xmath26 .",
    "we assume furthermore that the igm is homogeneous .",
    "our order - of - magnitude estimate using the above formula shows that for interstellar gas surface densities of @xmath82 cm@xmath6 the ram pressure is roughly balanced within a typical dwarf galaxy located in a galactic halo with @xmath85 @xmath74 . for galaxies with lower interstellar gas densities , ram pressure stripping in galactic halos becomes increasingly effective .",
    "since dwarf galaxies usually have heterogeneous interstellar media with varying densities , ram pressure may strip gas from their least dense regions when they encounter a relatively dense gas in a halo or the igm ( see bureau & carignan 2002 ) .",
    "the present - day mean density of the igm beyond galaxy halos in the local group is thought to be @xmath86 @xmath74 , which is too low to remove hi even from dirr / dsph dwarfs ( see quilis & moore 2001 ) , unless peculiar velocities are very high .",
    "this problem is more severe for dirr galaxies .",
    "for example , in leoa with its peak hi column densities of @xmath87 cm@xmath6 , ram pressure due to any uniform local group igm will have little effect on the gas .",
    "so the question of how transition dwarfs ( let alone dsphs ) became as gas - poor as is observed today remains unanswered .    a partial solution to this problem",
    "possibly lies in the evolution of the local group igm . in the past",
    "the igm may have been denser and perhaps also clumpier . during the formation starbursts of giant galaxies ,",
    "galactic winds would have been strong , giant galaxies probably had larger ` spheres of influence ' within which the igm would be highly perturbed , and dwarf galaxies could be stripped ( hirashita , kamaya , & mineshige 1997 ; scannapieco , ferrara , & broadhurst 2000 ) .    an obvious shortcoming of models that rely on proximity to giant galaxies for gas removal from dwarf systems is the existence of the cetus and tucana dsphs far from the milky way and m31 .",
    "one possibility is that both of these dwarfs once were near one of the local group giants , where they were stripped of their gas , but subsequently escaped towards their present locations .",
    "however , the time for them to reach their present day locations from the inner local group would be 6 to 10  gyr for a space velocity of 100  km  s@xmath26 , and so gas refill from stellar mass loss is an issue ( section [ sect_replen ] ) .",
    "this difficulty might be overcome if following stripping of an unbound dwarf galaxy in a close passage near a giant , the local group igm could remove stellar mass loss as it is injected .",
    "a rough estimate can be made by assuming that stellar mass loss fills an initially gas - free dwarf in a sound crossing time of 100 to 300  myr . in this case",
    "the gas density within a dwarf like cetus or tucana is @xmath88  @xmath74 with an ism mass corresponding to about 1000  m@xmath89 .",
    "even a very low - density igm with @xmath90 should be able to produce ram pressure stripping under these conditions in the few hundred myr time scale .",
    "apart from ram pressure stripping , tidal stripping may be a valid mechanism to rid low - mass galaxies of their gas _ if _ their orbits bring them near enough to massive galaxies .",
    "the dirr / dsph galaxy antlia is a close ( @xmath91 kpc ) companion of the more massive , gas - rich dirr ngc3109 ( van den bergh 1999b ) .",
    "antlia appears to have had a close encounter with ngc3109 about 1 gyr ago , which caused a warp in the disk of ngc3109 ( barnes & de blok 2001 ) .",
    "it now has a low hi mass of @xmath92 m@xmath1 .",
    "how much gas was lost from antlia during the encounter is unknown , but antlia may be a good candidate for tidal gas stripping .    however , tidal stripping does not seem to be a universally valid agent for the removal of gas , unless the more distant dsph and transition - type systems are on extremely eccentric orbits . and even in this case replenishment of their interstellar medium by mass lost from evolving stars will likely present a problem due to the long time interval between any hypothetical perigalacticon passages .",
    "an example of a gas - devoid dsph that shows no signature of tidal stripping is the strongly dark - matter - dominated , nearby milky way satellite draco ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 ) , one of the closest galactic dsphs .",
    "an alternative possibility for explaining the free - flying local group dsphs could be an inhomogeneous igm .",
    "if the igm is heterogeneous and contains regions where @xmath93 @xmath74 , then encounters with such clumps could remove hi gas in proto - dsphs that are far from giant galaxies .",
    "the details will depend on the geometry of the encounter .",
    "for instance , it has been suggested that the supergiant hi shell structure observed in the dirr ngc 6822 may have been caused by interaction with a massive hi cloud ( de blok & walter 2000 ) .",
    "this idea was also suggested as a model for the off - centered hi in the phoenix dsph / dirr by gallart et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and remains a viable option even after the irwin & tolstoy ( 2002 ) revision of the galaxy s radial velocity .",
    "the necessary structure in the local group igm could , for example , result from disturbances associated with the passage of galaxies through the igm ( see silk , wyse , & shields 1987 ) .",
    "another possibility is that initial rapid stripping of gas from some dwarfs occurred at relatively early times , when the igm may have been denser and more highly clumped .",
    "is there evidence for a heterogeneous igm in the local group ?",
    "high - velocity clouds appear to be mostly local objects in close proximity ( i.e. , within several kpc ) to massive galaxies such as the milky way ( wakker 2001 ) , which makes them unlikely agents for stripping of the more distant dsph galaxies .",
    "compact high - velocity clouds may be at larger distances ( e.g. , braun & burton 2001 ) , but recent hipass results ( putman et al .  2002 ) imply that they are largely part of local features , such as the magellanic stream .",
    "as such they may be capable of affecting nearby dsphs . previously reported hi clouds without optical counterparts in galaxy clusters could not be confirmed ( van driel et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "searches of nearby groups of galaxies for hi clouds down to masses of @xmath94 m@xmath1 yielded non - detections ( de blok et al .",
    "2002 ) , indicating that the present - day igm is not usually clumpy on these mass and density scales .",
    "the lowest column density limits reached so far are @xmath95 cm@xmath6 ( zwaan 2001 ; corresponding to upper bound density limits of a few times @xmath75 @xmath74 if sizes of 1 kpc are assumed ) , which appears to render a highly clumpy igm at the present epoch less likely .",
    "less massive clumps or more wide - spread igm inhomogeneities at earlier epochs , however , are not ruled out .    at low densities",
    "the igm will be photoionized by the uv background radiation in combination with any local sources .",
    "gas in this regime will not show up in hi surveys .",
    "however , uv and x - ray line studies can find such material through its line absorption if it contains metals .",
    "recent uv and x - ray absorption line studies suggest that intermediate - temperature ionized gas is present in galaxy groups , with local densities perhaps as high as @xmath75 @xmath74 ( fang et al .",
    "2002 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ; sembach et al .",
    "the origin of such features is not fully established , but they are most likely due to a combination of cosmic structure growth and disturbances associated with galaxies ( e.g. , oort 1970 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the absence of neutral gas does not exclude the presence of ionized gas in dsphs , and so surveys also have been made for diffuse ionized gas in a few dsph . an ultraviolet absorption line search for an ionized corona with @xmath96",
    "k around the dsph leoi , which experienced star formation until @xmath7 gyr ago , was unsuccessful ( bowen et al .",
    "1997 ; column density limit @xmath97 cm@xmath6 ) .",
    "similarly , a search for a @xmath0 k component in the dsph fornax , where star formation ceased 100  200 myr ago , yielded no detection ( gizis , mould , & djorgovski 1993 )",
    ".    however , gas may be present at lower ionization levels ( associated with gas at t @xmath98 k ) and hence have escaped detection .",
    "such gas would likely have a kinetic temperature comparable to the velocity dispersion of the dsphs and stay bound to the dsphs .",
    "sources of ionization would include the distance - dependent galactic uv radiation field , which would work for dsphs within a few hundred kpc distance from massive spiral galaxies , or recent star - formation events ( lin & murray 1998 ; mashchenko , carignan , & bouchard 2002 ) .",
    "internal sources of ionization that could operate in isolated dsphs , such as tucana and cetus , include sne ia heating ( burkert & ruiz - lapuente 1997 ) , hot white dwarfs ( dupree & raymond 1983 ) , or uv - bright post - asymptotic giant branch stars ( de boer 1985 ) .",
    "ionized gas at @xmath99 k would not have been seen in previous surveys , and even the most sensitive emission line observations can detect only relatively large amounts of diffusely distributed ionized gas in galactic dsphs .",
    "such a gas component , if it exists and if it accounts for a significant fraction of the missing ism in dsphs , would avoid the problem of finding gas _ removal _ mechanisms .",
    "one would then still be faced with the question of explaining why certain dwarfs , the dirrs and some des , contain neutral gas , while the ism remains fully ionized in others with fewer ob stars or other obvious internal ionization sources .",
    "however , if the ism _ were _ to become ionized in dsphs , then it would expand , have lower densities , and therefore would be more vulnerable to ram pressure stripping .",
    "such a process may have occurred during the re - ionization of the universe , potentially cutting off the supplies of gas for star formation in dwarf galaxies ( see thoul & weinberg 1996 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ; bullock et al .",
    "however , if this effect were too widespread , then it would not be consistent with the wide range of stellar population ages and gas content found in many local group dwarfs .",
    "we plan to return to a discussion of this issue in a later paper .",
    "evidently small galaxies might lose their gas early - on due to the effects of re - ionization , or they could be stripped of gas when they venture too close to a giant galaxy , particularly if it is in a starburst phase , as may have been common when galaxies were young .",
    "near the present - day local group giants the combination of tides and ram pressure stripping , likely with the aid of leaking ionizing radiation ( mashchenko , carignan , & bouchard 2002 ) , can clean gas from small galaxies .",
    "we further expect that galaxies with relatively low masses and less ism will be more readily relieved of their gas when in proximity to giant systems .",
    "thus in the giant galaxy stripping model , dwarf galaxies that evolved into nearly gas - free states as they came near a giant galaxy were most readily converted into dsphs .",
    "this model predicts that _ no _ gas - free dsph should be found outside of galaxy groups , and none are known at the present time .",
    "the intermediate cases presented by tucana and cetus , dsphs far from any large galaxies , then are critical .",
    "they either may be runaways from the inner local group , or , if the igm is clumpy , stripped by dense areas of the local group s igm .",
    "when dsphs formed most of their stars , they must have contained substantial amounts of interstellar gas , and would presumably have resembled present - day dirrs or related classes of galaxies .",
    "yet somehow star formation ceased and gas was lost and these objects evolved into dsphs . that this process took place at different times",
    "is clear from the range in mean stellar population ages in the nearby dsph galaxies .",
    "continuity then suggests that the birth of dsphs should be an ongoing process , and that `` pre - dsph '' galaxies may exist in or near the local group .",
    "this leads to the question of whether plausible dsph progenitors can be identified among well - studied dwarf galaxies with resolved stellar populations in our immediate cosmic neighborhood , and whether evidence exists for a continuing transformation from gas - rich to gas - poor dwarfs .",
    "an alternative scenario would be that dsphs form a separate class of their own , with properties pre - defined at birth , as suggested by binggeli ( 1994 ) and supported by skillman & bender ( 1995 ) .",
    "our analysis of the luminosity - metallicity relation based on chemical abundances of red giants shows the well - known separation between dirrs and dsphs in the sense that dirrs are too metal - poor for their luminosity as compared to dsphs .",
    "mere fading would not turn typical dirrs into typical dsphs , since they would also fade in surface brightness , resulting in surface brightnesses below those of dsphs at the same luminosity .",
    "conversely , the rapid initial enrichment that old populations in dsphs experienced is not observed in dirrs , where star formation and enrichment proceed slowly over a hubble time .",
    "the dirrs also would need to lose their angular momentum and interstellar medium , since neither rotation nor gas are detected in typical dsphs .",
    "hence transformation from dirrs to dsphs through gas loss alone appears to be unlikely , and in this regard our conclusions parallel those of a number of earlier studies ( e.g. , binggeli 1986 ; thuan 1986 ) .    the dirr / dsph transition - type galaxies exhibit stellar and optical structural properties consistent with those of dsphs , while containing hi gas .",
    "the dirr / dsph systems also fall near the dsph locus in the luminosity - metallicity relation . like dsphs",
    ", they show very little or , more commonly , no rotation in their hi , and have stellar populations whose properties closely resemble those in a number of dsphs .",
    "their present - day star - formation rates are very low , and a complete cessation of stellar births would not significantly alter their position in the luminosity - metallicity diagram .",
    "the transition - type dwarfs appear to be gas - rich examples of dsph systems . as",
    "none is in danger of complete gas exhaustion due to ongoing star formation , a gas - cleaning process seems necessary to convert them into dsphs .",
    "evidently early astration was comparatively rapid in both transition - type and dsph galaxies , so their internal conditions near the time of their formation were probably factors in defining their subsequent evolution .",
    "we therefore find the transition - type dwarfs to constitute plausible progenitors of dsphs .",
    "we briefly considered various mechanisms whereby dwarfs could lose their interstellar matter , and discussed possible examples of ongoing gas removal .",
    "intrinsic processes currently seem to play a negligible role , and tidal effects alone appear to be incapable of having completely removed the gas from dsphs ( unless the dsph orbits , which are still unknown , are highly eccentric and we have missed the rare gas stripping episodes ; see mayer et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "the most plausible generic gas removal mechanism appears to be ram pressure stripping , and at present this will be effective in removing primordial gas reserves only when dwarfs pass near giant galaxies .",
    "this in combination with tidal effects may explain the clustering of dsphs around the local group spirals .",
    "we discuss the case of the dsph fornax , which lost its gas during the past 100 myr and which is approaching its perigalacticon , but find ram pressure stripping through a homogeneous igm to be little likely to be responsible for the removal of fornax ism .",
    "beyond the halos of spirals , a smooth local group igm , with its low estimated upper limit gas density of @xmath73  @xmath74 , will have little impact on the typical hi disks of even small dwarfs ( see section [ sect_ram ] and mayer et al .",
    "yet we find a mixture of gas - deficient dsphs ( cetus and tucana ) along with gassy dirr galaxies in the outer regions of the local group .",
    "due to gas return from dying stars , some process must act to have kept neutral gas from collecting in the outer local group dsphs , even if they were stripped of gas during a close passage to a spiral or some other past anomalous event .",
    "we find that a low density igm can keep stellar mass loss from collecting .",
    "we also speculate that inhomogeneities in the local group igm , such that some regions have densities of @xmath93  @xmath74 , could strip dwarfs with low intrinsic gas densities .",
    "this option receives support from recent indications for inhomogeneities in the local group igm derived from ultraviolet and x - ray absorption line measurements .",
    "the local group gas - stripping scenario implies that gas - free dwarf galaxies will not be found in locations without an igm ; isolated dsph galaxies outside of groups or clusters of galaxies should not exist .",
    "alternatively , some of the missing gas in dsphs may simply be ionized and at temperatures near @xmath100 k , which would explain why it was not detected in hi 21-cm line surveys nor in uv absorption line studies .",
    "a combination of background and internal stellar ionization sources will be sufficient to sustain a relatively massive ionized interstellar medium , even in isolated , hi - deficient dsphs , such as tucana .",
    "sensitive fabry - prot techniques may make the detection of ionized interstellar matter in dsphs possible , if such gas exists ( gallagher et al .  2003 ) . since ionization will reduce gas densities ( and gravitational binding energies ) , it would also make it easier to strip interstellar matter from dwarfs",
    ". a combination of ionization and low - level ram pressure stripping should prevent the accumulation of gas lost from evolving stars in local group dsphs .",
    "environmental effects clearly have played a role in shaping the morphology  distance relation and the gas content of dwarf galaxies , but are certainly not the sole determining factor .",
    "for instance , while the gas content of low - mass dwarfs increases with increasing distance from a massive galaxy , transition - type dwarf galaxies with their low hi masses exist both in the wider surroundings of massive galaxies as well as in the field .",
    "furthermore , the current environment may have little connection with the formation of isolated dsphs like tucana or cetus .",
    "in this picture the local group dsph galaxies arose from a combination of factors .",
    "one parameter is closeness to one of the giant galaxies , but we argue that `` genetics '' is also important . the metallicities in older stars in dsphs suggest relatively rapid initial and mid - life star formation depleted gas supplies , making them vulnerable to stripping .",
    "transition dwarf dirr / dsphs then are examples of this class of galaxy that have retained their cool gas , while the more leisurely evolving dirrs are distinguished by having more gas and angular momentum while being less chemically evolved .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
