    "the study of domain walls ( dw ) magnetic ( static and dynamic ) @xcite and transport @xcite properties have attracted much attention recently due to their relevance for magneto - electronic nano - device applications . in the static case ,",
    "mcmichael and donahue have shown that in magnetic stripes head - to - head dw can be in vortex or transverse shape @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have observed these dw structures in magnetic thin films and rings @xcite .  in this work ,",
    "we study the dynamics of dw with magnetization mostly restricted to the plane of a nanometer - size thin film",
    ".   dw motion can be a source of low frequency noise in magnetic systems and thus hinder any potential applications .",
    "their high frequency behavior can however be tuned by choosing suitable boundary conditions or geometries .",
    "constrained dw oscillations can be high in frequency and hence there is a potential for their use in nano - electronics as resonators @xcite .",
    "at least two modes of oscillations have been studied in the literature ; a doring - type oscillation and a winter mode oscillation @xcite . the doring mode is associated with translations of the center of mass of the dw in an infinite system , while the winter modes are non - zero energy modes that , in addition to rigid translation , correspond to propagations along the dw .",
    "these modes are found by solving the time - dependent landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equations @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we focus only on dynamical properties of transverse _ tail - to - tail _ dw trapped in stripes with dimensions comparable to their width . this case",
    "is proved to be the most interesting due to the unusual magnetization dynamics as opposed to the conventional case of dw with widths being much smaller than the film size .",
    "in particular , we find that the low frequency excitations can be reduced in comparison with the usual cpp configuration having a uniform magnetization .",
    "such uniform magnetization is susceptible to large fluctuations due to spin momentum transfer and gives rise to appreciable @xmath0-like noise .",
    "@xcite we investigate dw formed by pinning the magnetization in the opposite directions at the edges along the easy axis .",
    "we show that dw motion can be controlled by a current perpendicular to the plane of the dw magnetization in contrast with the currently actively studied case of dw motion in nano - wires .",
    "@xcite    the ll equation is the basis for the present study .",
    "since , we are looking at thermal and current effects , a random field and a spin torque term are also added to the ll equation@xcite .",
    "we show that in the spin valve ( sv ) geometry suggested here the spin torque can provide the force needed to move the wall in a controlled fashion with @xmath1 times smaller current values than those needed to switch the uniform magnetization in a cpp sv .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .  in section [ sec : background ]",
    "we describe both the theoretical background and the computational model needed for our study .  in section [ sec :",
    "modes ] , we discuss the dw structure and we also calculate the lowest eigenmodes of the dw using a simple one dimensional model and compare it to the numerical solution .  it is shown that if the center of the dw is allowed to drift along the easy axis , the contribution to the 1/f - type noise increases .  in section [ subsec : spz ] , we study the effect of an external field and a cpp current on the sv with and without dw .  we find that sv with a uniform magnetization can be susceptible to unwanted behavior due the spin torque driven instabilities that are absent in a sv with a constrained dw .",
    "we consider a new cpp geometry with a constrained dw between two fixed layers one pinned along and the other pinned perpendicular to the direction of the current flow . we find that in this cpp structure the dw motion can be well controlled with current densities which do not lead to the magnetization instabilities .",
    "it is shown that accurate quantification of demagnetizing fields is not essential for a qualitative understanding of the influence of the spin torque on the dw .  in section [ sec : summ - conc ] , we summarize our results .",
    "for a magnetization @xmath2 with magnitude @xmath3 , the ll equation for @xmath4 with a damping in the gilbert form and time normalized by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the gyromagnetic ratio , is given by @xcite    @xmath7    where the effective field @xmath8 includes the exchange interaction , the anisotropy field along the @xmath9 axis , the demagnetization field , the oersted field , and the spin torque @xmath10 the damping term is taken to be @xmath11 in the absence of currents and is increased to @xmath12 in the presence of spin torques to account for spin accumulation at the normal - ferromagnetic interface . the exchange constant @xmath13 in this study .",
    "the random field @xmath14 is taken to be uniform and gaussian white at temperature @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite  in the presence of spin torques , the white noise assumption @xcite is strictly valid only for frequencies around the resonant frequency as shown in ref . .",
    "since we are only interested in currents below the critical current , the white noise assumption will not alter the qualitative conclusions of this work .",
    "the size of the discretized cell is taken @xmath17 in the plane of the film .",
    "the inclusion of the demagnetizing field is important in dw motion studies and hence a numerical treatment is often needed to get a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of a dw @xcite .  the last term in eq .",
    "[ eq : heff ] is the contribution of a spin torque from the pinned layer ( pl ) @xmath18 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath19 is dependent of geometrical parameters and @xmath20 is the current flowing perpendicular to the magnetic multi - layers .  the @xmath19 prefactor is dependent on the thickness @xmath21 , the cross section @xmath22 of the layer and the polarization of the current .",
    "assuming perfect polarization of the conduction electrons , with charge @xmath23 , by the reference layer and neglecting the angular dependence dependence , the spin torque coefficient is given by @xmath24 in the following simulations , the anisotropy field is taken @xmath25 and the saturated magnetization is @xmath26 .",
    "in this section , we introduce the geometry of the dw and study its excitation modes compared to those generated in the uniform case .",
    "we show that the in - plane components of the magnetizations have distinctly different lowest mode frequencies that are directly related to the inhomogeneities of the magnetization due to the dw .",
    "we also discuss the magnetization evolution if we remove the pinning boundary conditions and allow dw to relax to the uniform magnetization state .",
    "in addition to the zero temperature dynamics , we investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the motion of transverse dw .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have presented a study of magnetization dynamics for cpp geometry which includes a constrained dw layer .",
    "we have identified a doring - type mode and a new breathing mode .",
    "it is shown that the lowest modes of the dw dynamics can be understood in terms of the parity of the inhomogeneous ground state .",
    "we have investigated in details how the constrained dw dynamics is affected by the spin polarized current and thermal fluctuations and compared it with the traditional single domain free layer structures .",
    "in particular , we found that the currents needed to measure any appreciable motion of the dw are at least two orders of magnitude less than usual values of currents needed to switch the single domain magnetization .",
    "this difference is attributed to the appearance of a significant magnetization component of the constrained dw that is perpendicular to the pinned layer magnetization and the exchange field .",
    "we also find that thermally activated motion of the constricted dw has lower weight in the lower frequency region than that of the unconstrained dw .",
    "the latter shows well known telegraph type noise characteristics .",
    "this difference can be understood using notion of charged dw introduced by neel @xcite and competition of the magnetostatic and size dependent exchange interaction contributions to the dw potential for motion along the easy axis ( see fig .",
    "[ demag ] ) .",
    "the three magnetic layer cpp structure was introduced so that the spin torque effect on dw layer is maximized .",
    "this cpp geometry has been investigated and found to have a number of interesting properties such as ( i ) dw can be easily controlled by an external field or a polarized current with relatively small current densities ; ( ii ) linear dependence of resistance on the external field and current ; ( iii ) improved magnetization stability characteristics .",
    "experimental realization of the device proposed here requires finding ways to constrain the dw within the middle free layer .",
    "the pinning at the edges can be realized by creating permanent magnets with different coercivity and/or with anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) coupling .",
    "the af coupling at the edges needs antiferromagnets with different neel temperatures @xcite so that a properly designed field - cooling procedure could lead to the pinning in opposite directions at the edges of the magnetic stripe .",
    "other alternatives such as special shaping and padding also have been discussed in the literature in the context of stability of dw in magnetic nano - elements @xcite .",
