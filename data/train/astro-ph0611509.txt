    "a peak at [ fe / h]=1.7 exists which accounts for approximately 70% of the population , and there is a long tail to higher metallicities @xcite .",

    "sodium and aluminium abundance ratios are correlated , and both are anticorrelated with [ o / fe ] @xcite . @xcite",

    "[ cu / fe ] has been found to be constant for @xcite , but @xcite reported a trend of increasing [ cu / fe ] as the metallicity increased from to  0.5 .",
    "studies of the iron peak elements ( cr , ni , ti ) and metals ( sc , v ) have shown that there is no trend with respect to iron ( up to , consistent with primordial enrichment from type ii supernovae .",
    "the heavy neutron capture elements have been shown by @xcite and @xcite to increase sharply as a function of iron abundance .",
    "these results are in contrast to normal globular clusters , and suggest that the stellar winds from agb stars ( sources of s - process elements ) were involved with the enrichment of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the cluster also has several members that are of distinct classes , such as ch stars , ba stars , s stars @xcite and stars with strong co @xcite to name a few . here",
    "we present another object that has unusual abundance ratios , the formation of which is difficult to explain .    we have obtained observations of a sample of main sequence and turnoff ( msto ) stars within the cluster for several purposes .",
    "firstly , the possibility of an age - metallicity relation within the cluster s member stars was investigated @xcite .",
    "we found an age range of gyrs exists between the most metal - poor and metal - rich populations within the cluster , similar to that found by other studies @xcite .",
    "positions , photometry , metallicities and ages of the stars in the catalogue can be found in the electronic version of @xcite .",
    "the second goal was to determine abundance ratios of several elements  carbon , nitrogen , strontium and barium as functions of [ fe / h ] @xcite . in that analysis",
    "a metal - rich main sequence ( ms ) member , 2015448 , was found that exhibited unusual s - process abundance ratios .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to detail the abundance analysis for star 2015448 , and to propose possible formation scenarios . ",
    "[ or_sect ] briefly describes the observation and reduction process for our sample of main sequence and turnoff members .",
    "the stellar parameters and analysis are detailed in  [ spa_sect ] , while  [ d_sect ] discusses the possible formation scenarios for this object .",
    "the observations and reduction of our data are described in detail in @xcite to which we refer the reader . briefly , photometry for the cluster was obtained in the v and b bands , and samples were chosen within an annulus from the cluster center .",
    "two regions were defined near the msto , shown in figure [ cmd ] , and spectra were obtained for objects within these cmd regions using the two degree field spectrograph ( 2df ) on the anglo - australian telescope @xcite .",
    "figure [ cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram of all objects with no membership information as small dots , the sample of 420 radial velocity members as large dots , and the object that is the topic of this letter as a large star .",
    "this object , 2015448 , has @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this star immediately stood out in a visual inspection of the spectra , due to the anomalously strong sr lines , seen in a figure [ spec ] .",
    "its position is and ( j2000 ) . with a radial velocity of ,",
    "star 2015448 is likely to be a member of the cluster as @xmath0 cen has a radial velocity of @xcite    the observations were carried out in half hour exposures , and , as several such exposures were needed to obtain the required signal - to - noise of @xmath430 for each star , there are several individual observations for star 2015448 .",
    "also , this object was observed in observing sessions in 1998 , 1999 and 2002 , in different fibres and spectrographs .",
    "this gives an independent check on the relative strengths of the sr and ba features .",
    "it was found that the two sr features were present in all observations , while ba was not clearly detected in any of our spectra .",
    "a spectroscopic abundance analysis of the full sample is detailed in @xcite .",
    "abundances relative to iron of c , n and sr were determined using spectrum synthesis techniques .",
    "the ch feature at @xmath44300 was used to determine the [ c / fe ] abundance for each star .",
    "this [ c / fe ] was then adopted when the cn feature at 3883 was analyzed to find [ n / fe ] .",
    "the sr abundance ratio was determined using the two sr lines at 4077.71 and 4215.52 .",
    "when possible , [ ba / fe ] was also determined from the feature at 4554.03 .",
    "the process for calculating metallicities is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the sr - rich star has a metallicity of , determined solely from the auto - correlation function method , and an age of .",
    "this age is consistent with the mean age of the bulk of the stars in the cluster .",
    "the ages for the individual stars in the sample were calculated by fitting an isochrone to each object using the magnitude , color , metallicity and [ @xmath1/fe ] abundance ( y@xmath5 , @xcite , green table ) .",
    "this also enabled an individual temperature and gravity to be assigned to each star .",
    "a temperature of 5820 ( k ) , and were adopted for this object . a reddening @xcite and distance modulus were assumed .",
    "although the star s color is redder than the bulk of the population in the cluster , it is also more metal - rich than that population .",
    "the hydrogen line strengths in the observed spectrum are consistent with those expected on the basis of the star s color .",
    "synthetic spectra were obtained using the stellar models of kurucz ( 1993 ) , atomic line lists of bell ( 2000 , private communication ) and molecular line lists of kurucz .",
    "the spectrum synthesis code was developed by @xcite .",
    "more details of this process are given in @xcite .",
    "figure [ spec1 ] shows the synthetic spectrum fits to the ch , cn , sr and ba features .",
    "the g band at @xmath44300 was analyzed first , and gave a c abundance of .",
    "this feature loses its sensitivity for abundances less than , shown by the close proximity of the and 0.5  dex synthetic lines . as we have no information on o , which affects the c abundance obtained from the ch feature , a value of was assumed .",
    "this star was assumed to have a , which was then used when determining [ n / fe ] .",
    "synthesis of the cn feature at @xmath43883 led to a n abundance ratio of .",
    "a range of n abundance ratios are shown in the synthetic spectra , enabling an upper limit on to be placed on the n abundance ratio . the cn feature in figure [ spec1 ] shows that abundance ratios of and 1.0 are too high .",
    "however , this feature loses its sensitivity as smaller n abundance ratios are considered and only an upper limit can be determined .    the sr and ba lines were analyzed together .",
    "there were two sr lines used , sr ii at 4077.71 and sr ii at 4215.52 .",
    "the ba ii 4554.03 line was used to constrain the ba abundance ratio .",
    "the two sr lines are in agreement and yield .",
    "it can be seen clearly that a solar sr abundance ratio does not fit the observed spectrum .",
    "the cn bandhead at @xmath44216 can affect the abundance ratio obtained for the sr 4215 feature .",
    "however with an assumed solar n abundance ratio , there is little effect to the sr line . while the n abundance ratio could be as high as",
    ", spectrum synthesis calculations show this does not affect on the sr 4215 line significantly , and does not alter the abundance ratio obtained . using the same enhancement for ba that was found for sr ,",
    "one finds the predicted strength to be too high to fit the observed ba line .",
    "the sensitivity of the ba feature is low up until abundance ratios of , and an upper limit can be placed at this value .",
    "the stellar parameters temperature , gravity and metallicity , for star 2015448 were varied individually by their uncertainties to give an estimate of the error in our determined abundance ratios .",
    "these were then added in quadrature .",
    "the error in temperature comes from @xmath6 and the reddening , equating to @xmath7100k uncertainty in temperature .",
    "this propagated to errors of @xmath70.2  dex in c and @xmath70.1  dex in sr .",
    "gravity was changed by @xmath70.2  dex , and did not lead to any significant errors in the final abundance ratios . the uncertainty in metallicity propagated to errors in abundance ratios for and . the cn feature used to determine n",
    ", adopting the previously determined c abundance ratio for 2015448 , did not show any change with the above changes in temperature , gravity , metallicity , or the determined error in the c abundance ratio , due to the low sensitivity of this feature . to determine the effect of the assumed oxygen abundance , and + 0.3",
    "were used and the ch feature reanalyzed .",
    "it was found to have no noticeable effect on the [ c / fe ] abundance determined .",
    "this peculiar star in @xmath0 cen shows , , enhanced , and .",
    "the formation process that created it was unusual as there are no similar objects yet found within the cluster .",
    "we do find ms objects with high sr , but these also have similar enhancements in ba .",
    "this star was one out of 420 stars studied on the main sequence turnoff . given that it is a metal - rich star , and we only found 25 such objects , a more extensive search of other areas of the center of the cluster may prove fruitful in determining if there are more of these objects .",
    "on the rgb , at a metallicity of , most stars have @xcite , which is consistent with the upper limit found for star 2015448 .",
    "@xcite did not observe sr , and a direct comparison can not be made .",
    "however , they did investigate other light s - process elements such as y and zr .",
    "both of these elements have abundance ratios equal to or less than 0.6 , and no stars on the rgb exhibit s - process abundances as high as is found here for [ sr / fe ] .",
    "there are at least two possibilities that lead to the formation of this star .",
    "firstly , it may have been in a binary system with a companion that underwent unusual s - process enrichment and transfered mass to the star we see today . at present",
    "we have no evidence that this star is in a binary system : the individual velocities from the 1998 , 1999 and 2002 observations are consistent to within the measurement errors of .",
    "a second possibility is that the sr - rich star formed out of already enriched material .",
    "agb stars of low and intermediate mass dredge up @xmath8c to the surface via helium shell thermal pulses . in general ,",
    "if the star is more massive than @xmath43m@xmath9 , the @xmath8c is processed to @xmath10n via the cn cycle @xcite .",
    "the main s - process is thought to occur within the @xmath11c pocket where the neutron source is the reaction ( e.g. @xcite ) . to generate the abundance ratio seen here it would seem necessary that the s - processing occurs only for the light s - process elements , perhaps up to the peak at zr , rather than progressing through to heavy s - process elements which include ba .",
    "this was may be due to the neutron density not being high enough , as higher neutron densities , assuming all other parameters being equal , will produce larger amounts of heavier nuclei such as ba or la , relative to the lighter ones @xcite .",
    "another source of s - processing , known as the weak s - process , occurs in massive stars @xcite .",
    "the reaction is the source of the neutrons .",
    "most of the neutrons produced from this reaction are captured by the light elements , and only a small fraction are captured by the @xmath12fe seed nucleus , a process known as `` self - poisoning '' .",
    "this is the reason for the limited efficiency of the source for s - process .",
    "it allows for the production of only light s - process nuclei with mass numbers and sr , with a mass number of 87 , falls into this range .",
    "ba , on the other hand with mass number 137 , does not and little of this element is produced by this process @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether massive stars could also produce the necessary c and n abundance pattern found here , or whether star 2015448 contains other elemental abundance patterns that may have originated from these objects .",
    "the r - process occurs in an environment that is rich in neutrons , and the mean time between successive neutron captures in very short compared with the time to undergo @xmath13-decay .",
    "this scenario as the enrichment source also requires the presence of sne products such as calcium and iron , or to have the sr enriched material transferred but not any sne products .    using the abundance yields for the r and ( main ) s - process",
    "( occurring in low - to - intermediate mass agb stars ) from @xcite , and normalizing to [ sr / fe ] one finds a difference greater than one dex between predicted and observed abundances for ba . for the main s - process , the predicted abundance is , while the r - process predicts .",
    "both of these values are obviously too large , confirming the unusual nature of the source of the abundance patterns found in star 2015448 .",
    "however , it should be noted that agb star yields do not explain the abundance anomalies of na , mg , al , and o found in other stars of @xmath0 cen or globular clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this may be due to the inadequacy of the models used to calculate yields for these objects .    from weak s - process yields in massive stars",
    "@xcite , using an initial metallicity of and mass of 16m@xmath9 , and , in good agreement with the sr abundance and upper limit of the ba one obtained here .",
    "this indicates the weak s - process is the more favorable option for the source of enrichment in star 2015448 .",
    "this star is also highly unusual when compared to observations of field stars .",
    "studies of n - capture elements in samples of field stars for a range of metallicities show a spread in abundance ratios of sr and ba at low metallicities , with most stars having [ sr / fe ] or [ ba / fe ] @xmath140.0  @xcite . at higher metallicities ,",
    "the abundances are within @xmath40.5 of the solar abundance .",
    "a cool field giant , u aquarii , has enhanced [ sr / fe ] and [ y / fe ] abundances , and low [ ba / fe ] @xcite .",
    "this star is a faint r crb type variable star and shows no ch features , but strong @xmath8c@xmath15 bands .",
    "@xcite concluded that u aqr is a hydrogen deficient carbon star with enhanced abundances of the light s - process elements sr and y ( by a factor of @xmath4100 ) and little or no ba .",
    "it is now a he - c core of an evolved star of @xmath41m@xmath16 that ejected its h rich envelope at the he core flash .",
    "@xcite postulated that a single neutron exposure occurred at the flash resulting in a brief neutron irradiation producing only the light s - process elements .",
    "a similar giant , known as sakurai s object @xcite shows similarly enhanced c and light s - process elements , and is h deficient .",
    "these types of stars may be responsible for the abundance pattern found in star 2015448 .",
    "however , a significant difference is the c - rich nature of the giants compared with the carbon depleted nature of star 2015448 .",
    "our results provide a challenging puzzle to determine the source of the abundance patterns found for this star .",
    "that said , the resolution of our data is inadequate to address this question .",
    "higher resolution spectra with high s / n are needed to analyze as many elements as possible , in particular the s - process ones , to be able to obtain an accurate history for the evolution of star 2015448 .",
