    "we now sum the equations over a synchronized block @xmath145 of @xmath146 oscillators entrained at frequency @xmath147 .",

    "the block @xmath145 will give on the left hand side the quantity @xmath148 with @xmath149 the accumulated randomness .",
    "we will also use @xmath150 a key point in the arguments below is that the _ support _ of possible values of @xmath151 is the same as the support of the individual frequencies @xmath152 , but for large @xmath146 the _ typical _ value of @xmath151 will scale as @xmath153 for frequency distributions with a finite variance .",
    "for example , for a bounded frequency distribution , there is some probability ( very small for large @xmath146 ) that each @xmath152 in the block will have the maximum possible value @xmath154 , and then @xmath151 will take on the value @xmath154 . on the other hand ,",

    "the essence of the block - sum arguments is to compare the interaction sum , scaling as @xmath170 , with either the range of possible values of the frequency sum , scaling as @xmath146 , or the typical value , scaling as @xmath171 .",

    "the interaction sums between large blocks are independent of the sizes of the blocks , and the results essentially reduce to those of the model with nearest neighbor interactions .      in this section , we will obtain the regime of @xmath8 where it is impossible to have a macroscopic sized synchronized block . more precisely ,",
    "define the probability @xmath174 that there exists one or more contiguous blocks @xmath142 containing at least @xmath175 oscillators with @xmath176 some finite fraction .",

    "thus it is impossible to have a contiguous macroscopic block , containing an @xmath116 fraction of the oscillators locked to a common frequency , when @xmath192 . in any macroscopic segment of the chain",
    "there will always be ( i.e.  probability one as @xmath72 ) some finite blocks of `` runaway '' oscillators that are desynchronized from their neighbors .",

    "the result analogous to the one of the previous section is sufficient to show that for a one dimensional chain there will not be a macroscopic number of synchronized oscillators for finite coupling , since the unsynchronized blocks effectively cut the chain into noninteracting pieces .",

    "we analyze the mutual interaction between two distant blocks , which are separated by blocks of unsynchronized oscillators , and investigate their possible synchronization .",
    "it is more difficult to prove the existence of synchronization , rather than its absence , and the argument we present is less rigorous than in the previous section .",

    "this means that their diagnostic does not detect long range synchronization occurring through this mechanism .",
