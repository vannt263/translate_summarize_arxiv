    "models with a competition between a short - range ordering interaction and a long - range frustrating interaction are relevant to describe a large number of experimental systems in soft - matter physics ( diblock copolymer melts@xcite , cross - linked polymer mixtures@xcite and interpenetrating networks@xcite , oil - water surfactant mixtures@xcite ) and in magnetism ( ultra - thin magnetic films@xcite ) .",
    "there are also invoked to explain glass formation in quite different situations such as doped mott insulators@xcite and supercooled liquids@xcite .",
    "some generic features shown by these models are the existence of mesophases characterized by modulated spatial patterns and the importance of the fluctuations that strongly influence the physics at and above the transition to these various phases .    a simple version of a system with such a uniform frustration consists of a coulomb frustrated ising ferromagnet , in which ising spins placed on a three - dimensional cubic lattice interact via both nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic couplings and long - range coulombic antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the mean - field theory@xcite predicts a complex temperature - frustration phase diagram in which the low - temperature region displays infinite sequences of commensurate and incommensurate modulated phases and is separated from the high - temperature paramagnetic region by a line of second - order phase transitions .",
    "however , both an analytic work based on the self - consistent hartree approximation@xcite and a first monte - carlo study@xcite indicate that the fluctuations drive the transition from second to first order .",
    "at least in the region around the transition , the mean - field phase diagram is thus dubious .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to thoroughly investigate by monte carlo simulations the main characteristics of the phase diagram of the coulomb frustrated ising model .",
    "compared to other systems , this model poses several serious difficulties to computer simulations : one stems from the long - range nature of the frustrating interaction and the other concerns finite - size studies of phases with modulated order .",
    "after briefly presenting the model and reviewing the results of previous work ( section [ sec : monte - carlo - simul ] ) , we discuss in section [ sec : simu ] the methodological aspects of our monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have used two different algorithms : a novel cluster algorithm for small frustration and a parallel tempering method for large frustration .",
    "the results concerning the nature of the transition between the paramagnetic and the modulated phases are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a careful finite - size scaling analysis confirms the first - order character of this transition .",
    "we also give in this section a selected study of transitions between different modulated phases .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both positive and denote the strength of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic interaction , respectively ; @xmath3 , is the ising spin variable , and the bracket @xmath4 means that the summation is restricted to distinct pairs of nearest neighbors ; @xmath5 is the distance between the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 on a three - dimensional cubic lattice , and @xmath8 represents a coulomb - like interaction term such that @xmath9 when @xmath10 .",
    "because of the coulomb interaction , the existence of the thermodynamic limit requires that the total magnetization of the system be zero . as a consequence",
    ", ferromagnetic order is forbidden at all temperatures and for any non - zero value of the frustration parameter @xmath11 . in three",
    "dimensions one expects for this system an order - disorder transition at finite temperature , but contrary to the case of the unfrustrated system , the low - temperature ordered region exhibits a complex frustration - temperature phase diagram with a variety of modulated phases .",
    "we first summarize the exact results obtained for the ground states and the results of the mean - field theory@xcite , which both have guided the monte carlo simulations .",
    "at zero temperature , the phase diagram can be calculated exactly .",
    "it was done numerically for @xmath8 equal to the true coulombic interaction ( @xmath12 ) and analytically for @xmath8 expressed in terms of the lattice green function@xcite . for small values of the frustration parameter ,",
    "the ground state consists of lamellar phases in which lamellae of width @xmath13 made up by parallel planes of ferromagnetically aligned spins form a periodic structure of length @xmath14 along the orthogonal direction .",
    "when the frustration increases , the period of the lamellar phases decreases until one reaches @xmath15 .",
    "each lamellar phase is the ground state for a finite interval of the frustration parameter @xmath11 .",
    "when this latter goes to zero , the width of lamellae diverges as @xmath16 and the range of stability of the successive lamellar phases shrinks to zero as @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the ground states obtained by the numerical calculation for the true coulombic potential and those obtained by the analytical calculation for the inverse lattice laplacian are almost identical .    for larger values of the frustration parameter @xmath11",
    ", the system looses the translational invariance in a second direction and the ground states then consist of tubular phases .",
    "eventually , the translational invariance is lost in the third direction and the ground states are orthorhombic phases . in the limit of large frustrations ,",
    "the ground state is a nel antiferromagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "even if the sequence of ground states is the same for the true coulombic potential and for the inverse lattice laplacian potential , the sequence of frustration parameters to which these ground states are associated is more and more different when @xmath11 increases . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the region of small or moderate frustration parameters ( @xmath19 ) .      at finite temperature",
    ", the phase diagram can no longer be obtained exactly .",
    "we summarize here the results obtained within different approximations .",
    "a detailed analysis has been performed within the mean - field approximation@xcite .",
    "for each frustration parameter @xmath11 , there is a continuous transition at finite temperature between the disordered phase and modulated phases .",
    "the wave - vector that characterizes the modulation at the transition varies continuously with the frustration parameter ; as a result , a succession of incommensurate modulated phases is predicted along the transition line . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , the phase diagram is divided into two main regions : above the transition line ( full line ) , the system is disordered ( paramagnetic ) , whereas an infinite number of modulated phases exists at low temperatures ( only a few of them are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath11 goes to zero , the line of critical points goes continuously , but non - analytically toward @xmath20 , the critical temperature of the unfrustrated ising model . to describe the low - temperature region , it is convenient to use the short - hand notation introduced by fisher and selke@xcite for characterizing modulated phases : @xmath21 designates a modulated phase formed by the periodic repetition of a fundamental pattern consisting of a succession of @xmath22 lamellae of width @xmath23 , followed by @xmath24 lamellae of width @xmath25 , and so on , where the @xmath26 s and the @xmath27 s are integers and where two successive lamellae are composed of spins of opposite sign . from the zero temperature axis",
    "springs an infinite number of quasi - vertical lines that separate the various simple lamellar phases @xmath28 . at finite ( nonzero ) temperatures ,",
    "these lines split into branches separating phases with more complex modulations , each branch splitting itself at higher temperature into new branches , etc .",
    ", according to `` structure combination branching processes''@xcite .",
    "close to the transition line , one expects incommensurate phases . by using the soliton approach developed by bak and coworkers@xcite , an approach that focuses on the behavior of the domain walls that separate commensurate regions , one can study the melting of commensurate phases into incommensurate phases : the resulting lines are shown as the dotted and dashed curves in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "in addition to the mean - field description , the mean - spherical version of this model , in which spins are taken to be real numbers with the global constraint that their mean square value is equal to one , has also been studied@xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the transition between disordered and modulated phases is also predicted to be continuous , albeit with a novel feature coined `` avoided critical behavior''@xcite : for vanishing frustration , the transition temperature goes to a value that is much below the temperature @xmath20 of the unfrustrated model .",
    "et al._@xcite have subsequently shown that this behavior remains for spin variables with @xmath29 symmetry whenever @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ( ising spins ) , one expects the coulomb frustrated model to be in the brazovskii class of hamiltonians@xcite and consequently , as predicted from a self - consistent hartree approximation , to display a first - order transition between modulated and disordered phases .",
    "since the mean - field approximation predicts a continuous transition ( see above ) , the change of order of the transition is induced by the fluctuations .",
    "the coulombic interaction is the source of several difficulties and limitations for computer simulations that we now review .",
    "\\(i ) to properly account for the long range nature of the interactions in systems with periodic boundary conditions , the minimum image convention used in models with short - range interactions can not be used , and a complete calculation of the site - site interaction terms requires to consider all images of the simulation basic cell , a procedure that is realized by using ewald sums@xcite . for a lattice system , the site - site pair interaction terms are calculated once for all at the beginning of the run and are stored in an array for the entire run .",
    "therefore , a large number of reciprocal vectors can be included in the ewald sum , which ensures a very good accuracy for the calculation of the coulomb potential .",
    "\\(ii ) for a single spin flip , the energy update involving coulombic terms is performed by summing over all lattice sites .",
    "therefore , for a lattice with a linear size @xmath32 and with a constant monte carlo swap per spin , the computer time is proportional to @xmath33 for a system with coulombic interactions whereas is goes only as @xmath34 for a system with short - range interactions . for a given computer time",
    ", the maximum linear size that one can consider for the coulomb frustrated model systems is then roughly the square root of the linear size of its counterpart without frustration .",
    "this strongly limits the largest system size that can be studied with the present computer capabilities ( typically @xmath35 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the mean - field analysis summarized above has revealed that upon decreasing the temperature at fixed value of the frustration parameter @xmath11 , the system undergoes a sequence of phase transitions involving different modulations before reaching the ground state .",
    "this complex phase diagram corresponds of course to a system in the thermodynamic limit . in a monte carlo study",
    ", one must perform a finite - size analysis in order to extrapolate to the limit of an infinite system . for simple models in which only a finite number of phases are present",
    ", one has to study a finite number of transition lines ; increasing the size of the system progressively moves these lines toward their location in the thermodynamic limit . in the present model",
    ", a small temperature range may include a large number of modulated phases that may or may not be observed in a finite system depending on the commensurability between the period of the modulation and the linear size of the system . upon increasing this latter , not only do the phase boundaries move ( as in a standard model ) , but new phases with more complex modulation patterns may appear as well .",
    "this feature , akin to a process of degeneracy lifting , makes the finite - size analysis much more difficult .",
    "\\(iv ) to ensure that the proper ground state is obtained , the size of the lattice must be compatible with the period of the expected lamellar phase .",
    "for instance , for a ground state corresponding to an @xmath28 phase , a system of size @xmath36 with @xmath37 in at least one direction must be used ; otherwise , the system misses the proper phase transition , and the energy in the low - temperature region is much higher than that obtained with commensurate lattice sizes .",
    "this limits the range of frustration parameters that can be studied .",
    "a first monte - carlo study@xcite was performed by using a metropolis algorithm with the constraint of zero total magnetization .",
    "the phase boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the modulated phases was located .",
    "the double peak structure of the energy histograms close to the transition region and the occurrence of a hysteresis loop between heating and cooling runs strongly suggested that the transition is first - order .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to complete this first study by a more exhaustive investigation of the phase diagram and a finite - size scaling analysis . in order to achieve this ,",
    "more efficient algorithms have been developed .      for continuous and weak first - order transitions ,",
    "cluster algorithms improve the convergence of monte carlo runs close to the transition@xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the available methods : the standard cluster algorithms ( swendsen - wang@xcite and wolff@xcite ) take advantage of a local symmetry , like the up - down spin symmetry , but they can not be used for systems which have the constraint of zero total magnetization . for hamiltonians with algebraic interactions ,",
    "an efficient full cluster method has been developed@xcite , that generalizes the swendsen - wang ( or wolff ) algorithm to long - range interactions .",
    "this method , as the previous ones , requires the existence of a local symmetry and can not be straightforwardly applied to coulombic systems .",
    "( recall that in the present model this constraint stems from the existence of the thermodynamic limit . )",
    "recently , dress and krauth@xcite have introduced a cluster algorithm that makes use of the geometrical symmetries of the system .",
    "these symmetries are conserved even in the presence of the constraint of zero total magnetization .",
    "dress and krauth first studied a hard - sphere system .",
    "herringa and blte@xcite subsequently implemented this algorithm for a lattice gas ( or correspondingly an ising spin system ) with short - range interactions .",
    "the procedure is the following : two thermal clusters of opposite signs are simultaneously grown by randomly choosing a seed site and its symmetric counterpart obtained through a geometrical symmetry ( translation , rotation , inversion ,  ) of the hamiltonian ; the clusters are built by adding neighboring spins of same orientation with the probability @xmath38 .",
    "it can be shown that provided the symmetry group allows for particles to reach any site of the system , the algorithm satisfies ergodicity , and the detailed balance is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the probability of growing two clusters whose global flips transform a spin configuration @xmath6 into @xmath7 , @xmath41 is the acceptance ratio for this change of configurations , and @xmath42 is the boltzmann distribution . with the two clusters built with the bond probability @xmath43 , one can easily show that@xcite @xmath44 as can be checked by substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) in eq.([eq:2 ] ) , one can then choose @xmath45 , i.e. , the flip of a cluster is always accepted@xcite .    for systems",
    "whose hamiltonians can be divided into two parts , a reference hamiltonian @xmath46 with short - ranged interactions and a hamiltonian @xmath47 with long - ranged interactions , we propose the following hybrid cluster algorithm .",
    "the clusters are built with bonds corresponding to the reference hamiltonian , but instead of accepting all the ising clusters that are formed , the detailed balance is now expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the difference of energy between the @xmath7th and the @xmath6th configurations for the hamiltonian @xmath47 .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath50 is chosen according to a metropolis rule : the new configuration is accepted if @xmath51 , otherwise a random number @xmath52 is chosen between @xmath53 and @xmath54 from a uniform distribution and the new configuration is accepted if @xmath55 .",
    "this algorithm remains efficient if @xmath56 for most generated configurations ; the rate of acceptance is then close to @xmath54 and most generated configurations are accepted@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for our model , the long - range anti - ferromagnetic interaction never satisfies the above condition , and the acceptance ratio is then very small : clusters are almost never flipped , and the procedure becomes inefficient .    in order to construct a better cluster algorithm ,",
    "let us first analyze the drawback of the above method .",
    "close to the transition temperature , the clusters , which have been built by using the reference hamiltonian , are actually too large . they have indeed been generated with a bond probability that is too large because it corresponds , for the reference system , to a temperature that is located below its critical temperature .",
    "close to the transition temperature @xmath57 , the typical excitations in the pure ising model are much larger than those for the frustrated system because the existence of large domains is prevented in this latter by the frustration ( recall that @xmath58 . as a consequence ,",
    "the acceptance ratio becomes very small and the generated clusters are almost never flipped .",
    "it is possible to obtain a more reasonable acceptance ratio by modifying the above procedure as follows : two thermal clusters of opposite signs are grown simultaneously by choosing randomly a seed site and its symmetric counterpart obtained through a geometrical symmetry ( translation , rotation , inversion ,  ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "one then adds neighboring spins of same orientation in each cluster with the probability @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the detailed balance is given by , @xmath61 where all quantities are defined below eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) . combining eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ( this latter being expressed from the reference hamiltonian ) , one obtains @xmath62,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the energy difference between the @xmath7th and the @xmath6th configurations for the reference hamiltonian .",
    "note that when @xmath64 , the cluster size goes to @xmath54 , and one recovers a two - spin metropolis rule .",
    "for nonzero @xmath65 , the metropolis rule for the cluster acceptance is the following : the new configuration is accepted if @xmath66 ; otherwise , a random number @xmath52 is chosen between @xmath53 and @xmath54 from a uniform distribution and the new configuration is accepted if @xmath67 .    in preliminary runs , @xmath65 has been tuned for obtaining the highest acceptance ratio .",
    "we have found that this latter is attained for an effective temperature slightly above the critical temperature of the unfrustrated ising model ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "for higher effective temperatures , the cluster size decreases very rapidly and the algorithm reduces then to a metropolis algorithm .",
    "when @xmath68 , the system jumps from disordered states to modulated states and vice versa along the run , which suppresses the hysteresis between heating and cooling runs that was observed in simulations performed with a simple metropolis algorithm@xcite .",
    "since the system is now equilibrated at each temperature , one observes a double - peak structure ( in the energy histograms around the transition temperature ) , and it is possible to determine the value of the specific heat at the transition .",
    "in addition to this hybrid cluster algorithm , we have also implemented a parallel tempering algorithm .",
    "first introduced by hukusima and nemoto@xcite in the context of spin glass models , this method belongs to the class of multicanonical monte carlo algorithms@xcite which are well adapted for the study of first - order transitions . for a small frustration parameter @xmath69 ,",
    "the first - order character of the transition from disordered to modulated phases is expected to be rather weak , and the hybrid cluster algorithm has a better convergence .",
    "for @xmath70 , the two methods have a comparable efficiency . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the energy discontinuity becomes higher , and the parallel tempering method is the most efficient .",
    "a first series of simulations has been performed for estimating the location of the transition line that separates the paramagnetic phase from the modulated phase .",
    "the transition temperature for each value of @xmath11 has been estimated by first monitoring the melting the ( known ) ground state when increasing the temperature .",
    "the results are shown as open symbols ( and full , dark line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the decrease of the transition temperature @xmath72 with increasing frustration is more rapid than in the mean - field approximation : @xmath73 drops from @xmath74 for @xmath75 to @xmath76 for @xmath77 and to @xmath78 for @xmath79 . for",
    "the largest frustration studied , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , one notices , however , some peculiar features of the transition line so obtained : small cusps are observed around @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ; this latter case even corresponds to an absolute minimum of the transition curve with @xmath85 .",
    "these features can be understood by comparing with the mean - field phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the cusp - like regions precisely correspond to the location of the springing `` flowers''of phases with complex modulations , and our study with limited system sizes misses the appearance of these modulated phases .    before coming back to the above point in more detail ,",
    "we first address the question of the order of the transition to the paramagnetic phase . to do so ,",
    "we restrict the analysis to a range of frustration parameters for which the interference of mixed lamellar phases with complex modulation patterns is expected to be minimal : for @xmath11 between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , one expects a direct melting of the ground state , the simple lamellar phase @xmath88 , into the disordered phase ( see figs .",

    "we have computed the maximum of the specific heat @xmath93 and the shift of the apparent transition temperature @xmath94 .",
    "( since the total magnetization is set to zero , the corresponding binder cumulants can not used for this model ) . for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "the scaling laws for these quantities are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is equal to @xmath98 , the dimension of the system .",
    "the maximum of the specific heat versus @xmath32 is displayed on a @xmath99 plot in fig .",

    "this clearly shows that , at least in the range of frustration parameters where finite - size scaling is achievable , the transition between the paramagnetic and the modulated phases is a first - order one .      for temperatures below the disordered - modulated transition",
    ", the mean - field theory predicts that the system undergoes a series of transitions to various commensurate and , possibly , incommensurate phases , which gives to the phase diagram the flower - like structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "because of the finite size of the system studied in simulations , it is not possible to observe incommensurate phases , but one can expect to detect transitions between different commensurate phases provided that the lattice size is commensurable with the periods of the distinct modulated phases . since the required lattice sizes are larger than the maximum size of cubic simulation cells compatible with reasonable computer time , we have used anisotropic simulation cells .",
    "the main advantage is that the computer time increases only like @xmath104 where @xmath32 is the largest linear size of the lattice and @xmath105 is the size in the perpendicular directions , instead of @xmath33 for cubic cells .",
