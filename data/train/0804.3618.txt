    "this system is dynamically equivalent to the duffing oscillator , which exhibits a fixed point bifurcation : a loss of stability in a fixed point as a control parameter ( in this case a driving force ) is varied@xcite . near the bifurcation , the system becomes very sensitive to fluctuations , a sensitivity that can be harnessed to make a signal amplifier@xcite , or sensitive charge detector@xcite .",
    "such a bifurcation amplifier has recently been used in the study of superconducting qubits@xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the small signal gain and noise power spectrum for quantised quartic nonlinear nanomechanical oscillator when the harmonic driving force is subject to a perturbation .",

    "the actual physical model for dissipation in quantum nems is still under investigation . for the purposes of this paper we will model damping via the quantum optics master equation@xcite .",
    "this assumes that the nanomechanical resonator is under - damped due to a weak coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",

    "we will henceforth assume low temperature operation so that @xmath24 . in the case of no signal field , this model was introduced long ago in quantum optics to describe optical bistability due to a kerr nonlinear medium@xcite .",
    "the system has a steady state , or fixed point , which can change stability as the driving field is varied .",
    "it is this dependance of fixed point stability on driving field that can be used to amplify a weak driving signal .",

    "a transducer may be regarded as in a coherent state . under these assumptions",
