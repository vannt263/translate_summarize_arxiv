    "there has been a recent influx of ideas and tools from quantum information theory that are being used to characterize many - body condensed matter systems .",
    "part of this interest stems from the fact that some subtle properties of the underlying phase of matter , otherwise difficult to calculate , can be found quite naturally by partitioning the density matrix of a ground - state wave function and calculating measures of entanglement .",
    "for example , in one dimensional critical systems , it was shown that the central charge can be determined via the scaling of the entanglement entropy which takes the form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the size of the partitioned region and @xmath4 is the central charge characterizing the critical point@xcite . in higher dimensional critical systems",
    "general results remain unknown , though interesting behavior has been found in a few isolated critical systems.@xcite    entanglement finds a natural place in the study of disordered systems where the concepts of entanglement and de - localization go hand in hand . for example , the entanglement entropy at infinite - randomness fixed points displays a similar @xmath5 scaling behavior in which , by analogy , it was proposed that these models may have very unconventional values for the central charge@xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured that while the entanglement entropy has a similar behavior as the translationally invariant case , the rnyi entropies are very different , and in fact constant .",
    "recent studies of the so - called _ single - particle _ entanglement entropy in disordered systems , in contrast to the many - body entanglement entropy described above , have found an interesting scaling behavior , @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is the system size and @xmath7 is related to the multifractal spectrum through , @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the scaling exponents of the inverse participation ratios ( iprs ) ( defined below)@xcite . in this work",
    "we extend this result and study the rnyi entropy for non - interacting disordered systems . whereas references only examined the @xmath10 moment of the rnyi entropy @xmath0",
    ", we show that the other moments yield more information about the multifractal spectrum .",
    "indeed more than the derivative of the multifractal spectrum at @xmath10 can be found by looking at other moments .",
    "specifically , for small @xmath11 the scaling behavior of the rnyi entropy and the iprs are identical .",
    "since the multifractal spectrum for the critical wavefunction is universal at anderson transition , the rnyi entropy for small @xmath11 is also universal @xcite .",
    "thus we show that as in the case of critical one dimensional systems , universal information can indeed be found through entanglement .",
    "the multifractal spectrum ( mfs)@xcite , like the central charge for critical 1 + 1 dimensional systems , plays an important role in characterizing non - interacting disordered systems@xcite .",
    "more concretely , the mfs is the set of scaling exponents of the ipr , defined as @xmath12 which is indexed by a real number @xmath13 it has been observed that in many critical disordered systems the iprs have a spectrum of scaling exponents defined by @xmath14 characterized by the spatial dimension @xmath15 and function @xmath16 which is the mfs .",
    "generically , the mfs can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a function of @xmath11 that depends on the system .",
    "for a conventional band insulator @xmath19 while in a metal @xmath20 . at a critical point , the @xmath18 can have a non - trivial dependence on @xmath11@xcite .",
    "the mfs and its symmetry properties play a central role in restricting the possible types of critical field theories one can construct@xcite .",
    "an understanding of the multifractal nature of critical wave functions is hence important for an understanding of the localization transition .",
    "additionally , advances in imaging have also made it possible to begin to observe the multifractal spectrum in a number of disordered systems at the anderson transition@xcite .",
    "our interest , however , in the connection between the mfs and the rnyi entropies , is chiefly theoretical . while for the sake of argument we consider models where the multifractal spectra are known , in general this set of exponents is difficult to compute .",
    "we demonstrate that a much simpler calculation gives an accurate approximation to an interesting region of the mfs . by an explicit calculation and two numerical examples ,",
    "we show that the information content of critical wavefunctions of disordered free - fermion models contains imprinted signatures of their mfs .",
    "the entanglement measures we focus on are the standard von - neumann entanglement entropy and a closely related quantity , the rnyi entropy . given a wave function @xmath21 , it is possible to construct the density matrix as , @xmath22 .",
    "the conventional entanglement entropy is calculated by partitioning the system into two spatial subregions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where only one subregion is observed , say region @xmath23 .",
    "one then traces out all of the possible configurations of region @xmath24 to yield the reduced density matrix @xmath25 the question is then asked how much information does @xmath23 know about region @xmath24 and an obvious candidate for such a measure is the von - neumann entropy of region @xmath23 , @xmath26 _ i.e. _ the entanglement entropy .",
    "a closely related quantity is the set of rnyi entropies , @xmath27parameterized by a real number @xmath11 such that as @xmath28 the rnyi entropy reduces to the von - neumann entropy .",
    "we are focusing on localization in terms of single particle physics and thus we will use a notion of single - particle entanglement for a choice of a single - particle eigenstate .",
    "one can define entanglement using a site occupation number basis in the second quantized fock space@xcite . from now on , we work with a single - particle eigenstate @xmath29 which can be written in the single particle occupation basis as done by previous authors@xcite . explicitly , the wave function can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalized single particle wavefunction and @xmath32 is the state with @xmath11 particles on site @xmath33 .",
    "the wavefunction can then be written as , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are states where the single particle is located in region @xmath23 at site @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix @xmath37 generically has the form , @xmath38 @xmath39 denoting the amplitude of the wavefunction at site @xmath40 in region @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the schmidt decomposition of such a wavefunction is easily carried out .",
    "using singular value decomposition , we can define a new basis @xmath42 and @xmath43 where the matrices @xmath44 are the unitary matrix of singular vectors for the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "that is , they satisfy the relationship @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the diagonal matrix containing the singular values of the matrix @xmath37 .",
    "there are only two non - zero elements in the single particle problem : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath50 is then easily written since the density matrix is now diagonal .",
    "one simply finds that @xmath51^n+\\left[\\sum_{i\\in b}b_{i}^2\\right]^n = p_{a}^n+p_{b}^n\\]]where @xmath52 is the probability that a particle in the single - body wavefunction @xmath53 lies in region a or b respectively .",
    "hence , we may write the rnyi entropy as @xmath54 which agrees with the expression for the entanglement entropy obtained by ref . as @xmath55    since",
    "we have restricted our attention to the one particle sector of the density matrix and not the full many - body density matrix , the entanglement entropy should not grow large with the subsystem size as has been noted previously@xcite .",
    "the expectation is that the same is true here .",
    "all the interesting behavior is in the scaling with the total system size . indeed , by looking at the entanglement of a single site",
    ", we can extract the dominant scaling behavior with the system size , @xmath3 .",
    "looking at the case where region @xmath23 is a single site @xmath56 , we simply have @xmath57 where @xmath15 is the dimension . clearly , any site @xmath56 is not especially privileged and hence , one should look at the average over all possible sites , chosen with a uniform probability distribution . denote @xmath58_{x_{i } }",
    "$ ] as this site average with respect to the uniform probability distribution .",
    "that is , in @xmath15 dimensions each site @xmath56 is chosen with equal probability @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the lattice constant .",
    "if we look at _ the site averaged _",
    "@xmath61 we obtain , @xmath62_{x_{i } } & =    \\left ( \\frac{a}{l } \\right)^{d } \\ \\sum_{x_{i } } \\left ( ( 1-p_{a}(x_i))^{n } + p_{a}^{n}(x_i ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\left ( \\frac{a}{l } \\right)^{d } \\left [ \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   n \\\\ m \\end{array } \\right ) ( -1)^{m } \\sum_{x_{i } } p_{a}^{m } + \\sum_{x_{i } } p_{a}^{n } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\            & = & \\left ( \\frac{a}{l } \\right)^{d } \\left [ \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } n\\\\m \\end{array } \\right ) ( -1)^{m } p_m+p_n\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\            & \\sim & \\left ( \\frac{a}{l } \\right)^{d } \\left [ \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } n\\\\m \\end{array } \\right ) ( -1)^{m } \\left(\\frac{a}{l}\\right)^{\\tau(m)}+\\left(\\frac{a}{l}\\right)^{\\tau(n)}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath63 can be identified with the inverse participation ratio , @xmath64 which we recall scales as @xmath65 , where the @xmath16 are the multifractal spectrum .",
    "one finds that for @xmath66 the multifractal spectrum is strictly less than zero and the site - averaged @xmath67 can be approximated as , @xmath68_{x_{i } } \\simeq 1 - n(a / l)^{d } + \\left(a / l\\right)^{\\tau(n)+d}.\\ ] ] by extension , the site averaged rnyi entropy can be approximated as , @xmath69 which is the main result of this work and clearly shows the relationship between the rnyi entropies and the multifractal spectrum .",
    "grassberger@xcite found a related connection between rnyi entropies and the multifractal spectrum of the probability measures of classical strange attractors .",
    "as @xmath70 , as expected , our result reproduces the result of jia et .",
    "al @xcite for the von neumann entropy , up to a subleading correction that vanishes as @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , there is always a region where @xmath16 is less than zero where our approximation is valid since the multifractal spectrum is a non - decreasing , convex function with @xmath72 , the spatial dimension , and @xmath73 . for moments @xmath74 ,",
    "such a simplification can not be achieved and according to eq.(8 ) , we need to sum up all the terms to get the rnyi entropies .",
    "the connection between the moments of the rnyi entropies and the multifractal spectra for these large moments is less clear .",
    "we will now consider two well - studied models where the multi - fractal spectrum is known and compare our approximate form with the known results .",
    "we first consider a system of dirac fermions confined to 2d in the presence of a quenched random magnetic field normal to the plane with vanishing magnetic flux on average .",
    "such a system can be thought of as the continuum limit of various tight binding hamiltonians like the chalker - coddington network model@xcite .",
    "general considerations have predicted that the random magnetic field dirac model has an exact zero - mode critical wave function which is multi - fractal . as has been noted by numerous authors ,",
    "the most useful property of this model is that the wavefunction can be calculated _ exactly _ for any realization of the random magnetic field @xmath75 and is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the normalization factor . here",
    "the random magnetic field @xmath78 is assumed to be gaussian distributed with variance ( disorder strength ) @xmath79 , _ i.e. _ @xmath80 \\propto \\exp[-\\frac{1}{2 g } \\int d^{2}x [ \\nabla\\phi]^{2 } ] $ ] @xcite . to construct the reduced density matrix we simply note",
    "@xmath81     and the multifractal spectrum @xmath82 for the random - flux dirac model for system sizes l=[100,1000 ] . in figures",
    "( a ) , the system is in the strong disorder regime while in figures ( b),(c),(d ) the system is in the weak disorder regime . in both , we find good agreement between the scaling of the rnyi entropy and multifractal spectrum for exponents @xmath83.[fig2 : ] ]    depending on the value of @xmath79 , its been shown that the multifractal spectrum for a dirac fermion in a random magnetic field has two regimes . in the weak disorder regime ,",
    "defined by @xmath84 , the multifractal spectrum displays a discontinuous behavior as a function of @xmath11 that was found in ref .",
    "[ ] : @xmath85 in the strong disorder regime , where @xmath86 , the similarity between the rnyi entropy and the multifractal spectrum can also be seen for values of the exponents given by @xmath87 in both the weak and strong disorder regimes eq .

    ". good agreement between the two quantities is found .     in the prbm .",
    "the scaling behavior is shown for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for system sizes l=[100 , 1000 ] . in figures",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , the systems is in the weak multifractal regime with @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively . in figures ( c ) and ( d ) ,",
    "where @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , we can see that the agreement is good in the strong multifractal regime . in figure ( d ) , only @xmath96 and @xmath97 are shown for the sake of clarity . ]",
    "to see that eq .",
    "[ eqn : result ] is quite general for any single particle wave function , we explicitly check our result in a much simpler model : the periodic random banded model ( prbm ) .",
    "the model is defined as the ensemble of random hermitian @xmath98 matrices where the entires @xmath99 are independently distributed gaussian variables with mean zero and a variance that falls off as @xmath100 at @xmath101 the model undergoes an anderson transition from the localized @xmath102 to delocalized @xmath103 phases , for all values of @xmath104 . at this point ,",
    "the model shows key features of the anderson critical point , namely eigenfunctions possessing multifractal behavior .",
    "again there is a single extended wave function on which we will focus .",
    "we expect and confirm that the previous analysis holds for moments less than @xmath88 however , unlike the previous case , an analytic expression for the wave function is not known so we match our approximation to the numerical calculation of ipr scaling . to eliminate the effect of boundaries , we will look at the periodic version of this model where @xmath105 this can be interpreted as describing a 1d model with long range hopping that falls off as @xmath106 @xcite . from our previous results , it is expected that the combination @xmath107 should scale with the system size to some power , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is predicted to be @xmath110 ( note the change from @xmath111 to @xmath110 when compared with the random flux case due to the change in spatial dimension ) .",
    "systems of size l=[100 , 1000 ] were considered . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 : ] , @xmath109 matches very well with @xmath110 . in both the strong multifractal regime and weak multifractal regimes there is a range of values for which the scaling of the rnyi entropy and the inverse participation ratio are nearly identical .",
    "in conclusion , we showed that looking at the extended wave functions in the single particle occupation basis yields a general relationship between the rnyi entropies and multifractal spectrum .",
    "our results can be applied to a wide - range of models , two of which were explicitly shown in this work .",
    "we hope that the rnyi entropy formula offers a simpler and more efficient way to calculate universal pieces of the multifractal spectrum .",
    "the connection also opens the door to measuring rnyi entropies experimentally through the measurement of the multifractal spectrum via imaging .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to explore to what extent the rnyi entropy and the multifractal spectrum are related for many - body ground state wave functions .    _ acknowledgments _  this work was supported in part by the national science foundation through the grants dmr 0758462 ( ef , tlh ) and dmr-1064319 ( ef ) at the university of illinois .",
