    "the kopio experiment @xcite at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) alternating gradient sinchrotron ( ags ) is designed to measure the decay rate for @xmath3 , a `` gold plated '' cp - violating process @xcite .",
    "this experiment will provide the cleanest determination of the fundamental parameter that quantifies the phenomenon of cp violation in the context of the standard model .",
    "a measured decay rate very different from the precise expectation of the standard model , or one in conflict with cp violation results from the b sector , would be evidence for a new physics process .    a photon calorimeter which will occupy an area @xmath4 is one of the keystone elements of the kopio detector .",
    "studies of detector optimization led to the following requirements for photon detection , in the energy range of @xmath5 :    * energy resolution @xmath6 * time resolution about @xmath7 * calorimeter granularity @xmath8    shashlyk based calorimeter meets the specified requirements in an economical way .",
    "such a calorimeter is composed of shashlyk modules , which are lead - scintillator sandwiches read out by means of wave length shifting ( wls ) fibers passing through the holes in scintillator and lead .",
    "the first shashlyk calorimeter was designed and manufactured at institute for nuclear research ( moscow ) @xcite in 1991 for the experiment 865 @xcite ( search for the lepton number violating decay @xmath9 ) at the bnl ags . during the five - year high intensity run of the experiment ,",
    "the shashlyk calorimeter was a very stable and reliable detector .",
    "its features , together with its low cost and well understood method of construction , make this type of calorimeter a good candidate for other experimental projects .",
    "similar calorimeters were built later for phenix experiment at rhic ( bnl ) @xcite and for hera - b experiment at desy @xcite .",
    "a shashlyk calorimeters was also studied as a candidate for the cms experiment at lhc ( cern ) @xcite , and one is now under construction for lhcb experiment @xcite .    the e865 and other constructed calorimeters were designed to have an energy resolution about @xmath10 .",
    "significant improvements in calorimeter module construction can be made it possible to achieve the resolution @xmath11 required by experiment kopio .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the ways of such an upgrade .",
    "based on experience with the e865 module , a new prototype module has been designed , constructed and tested . as will be shown below this module provides an energy resolution about @xmath0 .",
    "while this improved resolution is not sufficient to meet the requirements of kopio , experimental studies of this module provide a reference point for tuning monte - carlo simulations . from such simulations , recommendations for constructing a shashlyk calorimeter for kopio",
    "the design of a prototype module for kopio is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "eighteen such modules had been produced at technoplast ( vladimir , russia ) .",
    "the module is a sandwich of alternating perforated stamped lead and injection molded polystyrene - based scintillator plates .",
    "the transverse size of module is @xmath12 ; the thicknesses of plates are @xmath13 for lead and @xmath14 for scintillator .",
    "each plate has 144 holes equidistantly arranged as @xmath15 matrix , with the spacing between the holes being @xmath16 .",
    "the diameters of the holes are 1.5 mm in the lead plates , while the holes in the scintillator have a conical shape with diameter ranging from 1.4 to 1.5 mm .",
    "72 wls fibers are inserted into these holes .",
    "each fiber is looped at the front of the module , so that both ends of a fiber are viewed by the photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "less than @xmath17 of light is lost while passing the loop , which radius is about @xmath18 .",
    "the fiber ends are collected in one bunch , cut and polished , and connected to a pmt . to improve the light collection @xmath19 perforated white reflecting paper ( tyvek ) is interleaved between lead and scintillator plates , and edges of scintillator plates",
    "are aluminized .",
    "the complete stack of all plates is held in compression by the four @xmath20 m stainless steel side strips that are pretensioned and welded to both front and back special endcaps .",
    "parameters of module are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".parameters of the prototype shashlyk module for kopio . [ cols= \" <",
    ", < \" , ]     one can see that improvements in mechanical and optical construction of modules can yield energy resolution of about @xmath2 , and that modules with thinner lead plates might give better results .",
    "there is almost no difference between the expected resolution for version 1 and 3 .",
    "a bigger longitudinal leakage fluctuations for version 3 are compensated by better sampling term .",
    "resolution is approximately @xmath21 worse if the shower is measured by @xmath22 modules .",
    "increasing of the number of modules to capture a larger fraction of visible energy is limited by a greater noise contribution .",
    "if fibers are not glued , resolution will be additionally increased by @xmath23",
    "modules for a shashlyk calorimeter with energy resolution about @xmath0 have been constructed and experimentally tested . using these results as well as results of special measurements , the detailed monte - carlo simulation of the shashlyk modules has been developed .",
    "our model of the shashlyk module includes ( i ) the geant 3 simulation of an electromagnetic shower ; ( ii ) the optical model for the simulation of light collection in the scintillator plates ; ( iii ) effects of light attenuation in the fibers ; ( iv ) effects of quantum efficiency of the photodetectors , and electronic noise and thresholds in readout system .",
    "this model gives an excellent description of the energy resolution for variety of experimentally studied shashlyk modules which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "a few measurements made with low energy photons @xcite are also in perfect agreement with the developed model .",
    "our monte - carlo simulation indicates the possibility of improving this resolution to about @xmath2 for module with lead plate thickness 0.25 mm . in a case with a realistic experimental environment , electronic noise and thresholds , and limited number of modules in a clump , the realized resolution of such a calorimeter",
    "is expected to be about @xmath24 .",
    "the experimental study of the test modules was performed in a @xmath1 positron beam without precise measurement of the beam momentum .",
    "for this reason extrapolation of the results of the measurements to the kopio energy region ( @xmath25 ) is somewhat uncertain .",
    "the possible way to eliminate this ambiguity is a new test measurement in a low momentum electron beam ( @xmath26 ) with a controlled spread in beam momentum or a measurement with low energy photons @xcite .    for future measurements we are planning to use the improved version of the kopio shashlyk modules with expected energy resolution @xmath27 .",
    "these measurements will include a study of the apd photodetectors and wave form digitizers for readout .",
