    "single particle interference is one of the most genuine quantum mechanical effects . since the original double - slit experiment @xcite",
    ", it has been observed with electrons in vacuum @xcite and even with the more massive @xmath0 molecules @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic rings threaded by a magnetic flux provided the solid - state analogous @xcite .",
    "intra - molecular interference has been recently discussed in molecular junctions for the case of strong @xcite and weak @xcite molecule - lead coupling . what unifies these realizations of quantum interference is that the travelling particle has two ( or more ) _ spatially equivalent _ paths at disposal to go from one point to another of the interferometer .",
    "interference , though is hindered by decoherence .",
    "generally , for junctions in the strong coupling regime decoherence can be neglected due to the short time of flight of the particle within the interferometer . in the weak coupling case , instead",
    ", the dwelling time is long .",
    "usually , the decoherence introduced by the leads dominates , in this regime , the picture and the dynamics essentially consists of sequential tunnelling events connecting the many - body eigenstates of the isolated system . yet",
    ", interference is achieved whenever two _ energetically equivalent _ paths involving degenerate states contribute to the dynamics ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] ) .",
    "interference survives as far as the splitting between the many body levels is smaller that the tunnelling rate to the leads since in this limit the system can not distinguish between the two paths .",
    "thus , in such devices , that we called interference single electron transistors@xcite ( iset ) , interference effects show up even in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "they can _ e.g. _ yield a selective spin blockade in an iset coupled to ferromagnetic leads@xcite .",
    "similar blocking effects have been found also in multiple quantum dot systems in dc @xcite and ac @xcite magnetic fields .        in the present paper",
    "we develop a general theory of interference blockade .",
    "we give in fact an _ a priori _ algorithm for the detection of the interference blocking states of a generic iset . as a concrete example",
    ", we analyze the triple dot iset ( see section  [ sec : triple_dot ] ) as it represents the simplest structure exhibiting interference blockade .",
    "in particular we concentrate on the blockade that involves an _ excited _ triplet state and we show how to prepare the system in each of the three spin states without application of any external magnetic field . thus we obtain an interference mediated control of the electron spin in quantum dots , a highly desirable property for spintronics @xcite and spin - qubit applications @xcite .",
    "the method of choice for the study of the dynamics in those systems is the generalized master equation approach for the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) , where coherences between degenerate states are retained @xcite .",
    "such coherences give rise to precession effects and ultimately cause interference blockade .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce a generic model of iset . in section [ sec : blocking_states ] we set the necessary and sufficient conditions which define the interference blocking states and a generic algorithm to detect them . in section [ sec : triple_dot ] we apply the theory to the triple dot molecule as archetypal example of iset .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] closes the paper with a summary of the results and conclusive remarks .",
    "let us consider the interference single electron transistor ( iset ) described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the central system and also contains the energy shift operated by a capacitively coupled gate electrode at the potential @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath4 is invariant with respect to a set of point symmetry operations that defines the symmetry group of the device .",
    "this fact ensures the existence of _ degenerate _ states . in particular , for essentially planar structures belonging to the @xmath5 group ,",
    "the ( non - accidental ) orbital degeneracy is at maximum twofold and can be resolved using the eigenvalues @xmath6 of the projection of the angular momentum along the principal axis of rotation .",
    "a generic eigenstate is then represented by the ket @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of electrons on the system , @xmath9 is the spin and @xmath10 the energy of the state .",
    "the size of the fock space can make the exact diagonalization of @xmath2 a numerical challenge in its own .",
    "we will not treat here this problem and concentrate instead on the transport characteristics .",
    "@xmath11 describes two reservoirs of non - interacting electrons with a difference @xmath12 between their electrochemical potentials .",
    "finally , @xmath13 accounts for the weak tunnelling coupling between the system and the leads , characteristic of sets , and we consider the tunnelling events restricted to the atoms or to the dots closest to the corresponding lead :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 and momentum @xmath16 in lead @xmath17 , @xmath18 creates an electron in the atom or dot closest to the lead @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the bare tunnelling amplitude that we assume for simplicity independent of @xmath19 , @xmath16 and @xmath9 .    in the weak coupling regime the dynamics essentially consists of sequential tunnelling events at the source and drain lead that induce a flow of probability between the many - body eigenstates of the system .",
    "it is natural to define , in this picture , a blocking state as a state which the system can enter but from which it can not escape .",
    "when the system occupies a blocking state the particle number can not change in time and the current vanishes .",
    "if degenerate states participate to transport , they can lead to interference since , like the two arms of an electronic interferometer , they are populated simultaneously .",
    "in particular , depending on the external parameters they can form linear superpositions which behave as blocking states . if a blocking state is the linear combination of degenerate states we call it _ interference blocking state_.    the coupling between the system and the leads not only generates the tunneling dynamics described so far , but also contributes to an internal dynamics of the system that leaves unchanged its particle number .",
    "in fact the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix @xmath21 of the system can be cast , to lowest non vanishing order in the coupling to the leads , in the form @xcite : @xmath22 - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[h_{\\rm eff},\\rho ] + \\mathcal{l}_{\\rm tun}\\rho .",

    ".   represents the coherent evolution of the system in absence of the leads .",
    "the operator @xmath23 describes instead the sequential tunnelling processes and is defined in terms of the transition amplitudes between the different many - body states .",
    "finally , @xmath24 renormalizes the coherent dynamics associated to the system hamiltonian and is also proportional to the system - lead tunnelling coupling .",
    "the specific form of @xmath25 depends on the details of the system , yet in all cases it is bias and gate voltage dependent and it vanishes for non degenerate states .",
    "for the description of the tunnelling dynamics contained in the superoperator @xmath23 it is convenient to classify all possible tunnelling events according to four categories : i)creation ( annihilation ) tunnelling events that increase ( decrease ) by one the number of electrons in the system , ii ) source ( drain ) tunnelling that involves the lead with the higher ( lower ) chemical potential , iii ) @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) tunnelling that involves an electron with spin up ( down ) with respect of the corresponding lead quantization axis , iv ) gain ( loss ) tunnelling that increases ( decreases ) the energy in the system .",
    "using categories i)-iii ) we can efficiently organize the matrix elements of the system component of @xmath13 in the matrices :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 means source and drain respectively and    @xmath30    is a matrix in itself , defined for every creation transition from a state with particle number @xmath8 and energy @xmath10 to one with @xmath31 particles and energy @xmath32 .",
    "we indicate correspondingly in the following transitions involving @xmath33 and @xmath34 as source - creation and drain - creation transitions .",
    "the compact notation @xmath35 indicates all possible combination of the quantum numbers @xmath6 and @xmath36 .",
    "it follows that the size of @xmath37 is @xmath38 where the function @xmath39 gives the degeneracy of the many - body energy level with @xmath8 particles and energy @xmath10 .",
    "analogously    @xmath40    accounts for the annihilation transitions .",
    "the fourth category concerns energy and it is intimately related to the first and the second .",
    "not all transitions are in fact allowed : due to the energy conservation and the pauli exclusion principle holding in the fermionic leads , the energy gain ( loss ) of the system associated to a gain ( loss ) transition is governed by the bias voltage .",

    "the zero current lines running parallel to the borders of the 6 , 4 and 2 particle diamonds are instead signatures of ground state interference that involves an orbitally non - degenerate ground state ( with 2 , 4 , and 6 particle ) and an orbitally double - degenerate one ( with 3 and 5 particles ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : equivalence ] we illustrate how to obtain an expression for the blocking states in these cases .",

    "the anomalous blockade region is delimited on three sides by transitions lines associated to the first excited two particle level @xmath47 .",
    "our group theoretical analysis shows that the two particle first excited state is a twofold orbitally degenerate spin triplet ( see table [ tab : degeneracies ] ) .",
    "in other terms we can classify its six states with the notation @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the projection of the angular momentum along the main rotation axis , perpendicular to the plane of the triple dot , and @xmath50 the component of the spin along a generic quantization axis .",
    "the @xmath51 energy level is instead twice spin degenerate and invariant under the symmetry operations of the point group @xmath52 .        in order to identify the 2 particle blocking states we perform",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section for the @xmath47 energy level with the gate and bias in the blocking region .",
    "firstly , we find that the @xmath47 energy level can be reached from @xmath53 via the drain - annihilation transition @xmath54 followed by the source - creation transition @xmath55 .",
    "secondly , the space of the decoupled states @xmath56 is empty and the only energetically allowed outgoing transition is the drain - annihilation @xmath57 transition .",
    "thus the blocking space is given by the expression :    @xmath58\\ ] ]    and has dimension three .",
    "for clearness we give in the appendix [ app : t_matrices ] the explicit expression of @xmath59 and the corresponding vectors that span @xmath60 . essentially , there is a blocking state for each of the three projection of the spin @xmath61 .",
    "this result is natural since , for unpolarized or parallel polarized leads , coherences between states of different spin projection along the common lead quantization axis do not survive in the stationary limit .    outside the blocking region",
    "either the first or the second blocking state conditions are violated . in particular , below the lower right border the state @xmath47 can not be reached from the global minimum since the @xmath55 source - creation transition is forbidden while above the upper left ( right ) borders the state @xmath47 can be depopulated towards the @xmath62 ( @xmath51 ) states via a source - creation ( drain - annihilation ) transition .",
    "the orbital interference blocking presented in the previous section acquires a spin dependence in presence of polarized leads .",
    "the lead polarization @xmath63 with @xmath17 is defined by means of the density of states @xmath64 at the fermi energy for the different spin states :    @xmath65    and is taken equal for the two leads @xmath66 . finally , the spin polarization influences the dynamics of the system via the spin dependent bare tunnelling rates @xmath67 that enter the definition of the tunnelling component of the liouvillian @xmath23 and the renormalization frequencies @xmath68 .",
    "we assume the leads to be parallel polarized so that no spin torque is active in the device and we can exclude the spin accumulation associated to that@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : i_vs_pvb ] we show the current in the excited state blocking region as a function of the bias and of the ( parallel ) lead polarization @xmath69 . for",

    "notice by comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : i_vs_pvb ] the correspondence between current blocking and spin preparation . ]",
    "the explanation of this effect relies on the third blocking condition , eq .  , and concerns the form of the effective hamiltonian introduced in eq .  .",
    "the latter can be written , due to the rotational symmetry of the system , in the form :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the projection of the angular momentum in the direction of the lead @xmath19 and it does not depend on the spin degree of freedom @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 is the frequency renormalization given to the states of spin projection @xmath61 by their coupling to the @xmath19 lead . in the appendix [ app : effective hamiltonian ] we give an explicit expression for @xmath68 and @xmath73 . in fig .",

    "the @xmath78 frequency increases ( decreases ) monotonously with the polarization .",
    "the @xmath79 frequency is instead independent of it . ]",
    "since the two particle ground state is totally symmetric ( @xmath80 symmetry ) , a three particle blocking state must be antisymmetric with respect to the vertical plane that intersects the center of the system and the drain dot .",
    "for this reason a blocking state is also an eigenstate of the projection @xmath81 of the angular momentum in the direction of the drain lead .",
    "consequently , the last blocking condition is satisfied only if : @xmath82 and the effective hamiltonian is proportional to @xmath81 .    for zero polarization in the leads the condition holds at the same bias for the three spin projections @xmath61 and",
    "the blocking state is a statistical mixture of the three spin projections . for polarized leads , instead",
    ", each spin projection is blocked at a specific bias and the spin on the system is controlled simply by changing the bias across the device .",

    "in this paper we addressed the interference effects that characterize the transport through a symmetric single electron transistor .",
    "in particular we gave the generic conditions for interference blockade and an algorithm for the identification of the interference blocking states as linear combination of degenerate many - body eigenstates of the system .",
    "as an application of the theory we studied the triple dot iset . despite its relative simplicity ,",
    "this system exhibits different types of interference blocking and it represents an interesting playground of the general theory . specifically , we concentrated on the interference blockade that involves an excited triplet state . in presence of polarized leads",
    "we exploited the interference blocking in order to access each of the triplet states by all electrical means .",
    "the theory is sufficiently general to be applied to any device consisting of a system with degenerate many - body spectrum weakly coupled to metallic leads _",
    "e.g. _ molecular junctions , graphene or carbon nanotube quantum dots , artificial molecules .",
    "in particular , the algebraic formulation of the blocking condition in terms of kernels of the tunnelling matrices @xmath84 , eq .  , allows a straightforward numerical implementation and makes the algorithm directly applicable to complex junctions with highly degenerate spectrum .",
    "we acknowledge financial support by the dfg under the programs sfb689 , spp1243 .      we derive here the equation ( 1 ) in [ ] as a specific example of the general theory presented in the paper .",
    "that equation represents the interference blocking condition for the simplest possible configuration involving only a non degenerate and a doubly degenerate state .",
    "let us consider for simplicity a spinless @xcite system and a gate and bias condition that restricts the set of relevant many - body states to three : one with @xmath8 particles and two ( degenerate ) with @xmath31 or @xmath85 particles .",
    "the interference blocking state , if it exists , belongs to the @xmath86 level .",
    "there is only one interesting tunnelling matrix to be analyzed , namely @xmath87 .",
    "let us take for it the generic form : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 indicate source and drain respectively and 1 and 2 label the two degenerate states with @xmath86 particles .",
    "@xmath91 are the elements of the @xmath92 matrices introduced in eqs .   and .",
    "this condition is identical to eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "the blocking state can finally be calculated as : @xmath96 where the @xmath97 is , in the relevant case , the entire space and the projector @xmath98 simply removes the last component of the vector that defines the one dimensional kernel .",
    "we give here explicitly the @xmath59 matrix necessary for the calculation of the triplet blocking states and the associated blocking states .",
    "the states in the @xmath51 doublet and in the two times orbitally degenerate triplet @xmath47 are labelled and ordered as follows : @xmath99 the elements of the @xmath100 matrices that compose @xmath59 have thus the general form : @xmath101 by orbital and spin symmetry arguments it is possible to show that @xmath102 where @xmath103 the subscript @xmath104 labels a reference dot and @xmath105 is the angle of the rotation that brings the dot @xmath19 on the dot @xmath104 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath106 reads :      the rank of this matrix is 6 since all columns are independent .",
    "thus @xmath108 coincides with the full hilbert space of the first excited 2 electron energy level .",
    "the blocking space @xmath109 reads : @xmath110 where @xmath111 reads      in accordance to its general definition given in eq .  , and the projector @xmath113 removes the last four components from the vectors that span @xmath114 .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the vectors that span the blocking space @xmath109 :      the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the components of the blocking states written in the @xmath47 basis set presented in .",
    "thus , the three blocking states correspond to the three different projectors of the total spin @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "we present here explicitly the renormalization frequency @xmath68 and the projection of the angular momentum @xmath73 which appear in the expression of the effective hamiltonian .",

    "we defined the function @xmath122 $ ] ,",
    "where @xmath123 , @xmath124 is the temperature and @xmath125 is the digamma function .",
    "moreover @xmath126 is the bare tunnelling rate to the lead @xmath19 of an electron of spin @xmath127 , where @xmath20 is the tunnelling amplitude and @xmath128 is the density of states for electrons of spin @xmath127 in the lead @xmath19 at the corresponding chemical potential @xmath129 . due to the particular choice of the arbitrary phase of the @xmath130 particle excited states ,",
    "@xmath68 does not depend on the orbital quantum number @xmath6 .",
    "it depends instead on the bias and gate voltage through the energy of the @xmath131 , @xmath47 and @xmath132 particle states .        where @xmath135 is the angle of which we have to rotate the triple dot system to bring the middle dot @xmath104 into the position of the contact dot @xmath19 . for a derivation of ( [ eq : angular_momentum ] ) see the supplementary material of [ ]",

    "if the equilibrium chemical potential is not set to zero the many - body energy spectrum should be substituted with the spectrum of the many - body free energy ( @xmath137 ) where @xmath138 is the chemical potential of the leads at zero bias .",
