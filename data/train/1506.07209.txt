    "in a nature article by b. cederwall et al.[1 ] , they report findings of equally spaced levels j=0 , 2 , 4 , 6 in the 8 hole nucleus @xmath4pd .",
    "their calculated b(e2 ) s [ 1.2 ] are not consistent with a simple vibrational interpretation . in the `` supplements material '' of the nature article",
    "they feel that they have an isoscalar spin aligned coupling scheme and emphasize configurations in which a neutron and proton couple to j = j@xmath0=9 in the g@xmath5 shell .",
    "cleary , they emphasize the importance of odd - j t=0 two - body matrix elements .",
    "robinson et al.[3 ] noted that in a large space calculation the static quadrupole moment of the lowest 2@xmath6 state of @xmath4pd was very small , consistent with the vibrational picture . on the other hand , @xmath7cd turned out to be prolate , and @xmath8ru , oblate .",
    "previous to this , robinson et al.[4 ] made a study of doing full fp calculations of another 8 particle system , @xmath9cr .",
    "they compared the results of including all two - body matrix elements with those in which all t=0 two - body matrix elements were set to zero .",
    "the qualitative discussions in the 2 cases were quite different . in a lanl preprint by robinson",
    "et al.[5 ] , a figure is shown which confirms the implications of refs [ 1,2 ] that dire consequences occur when t=0 two - body matrix elements are set to zero . with one of the interactions used , the first 6@xmath6 and 8@xmath6 states are nearly degenerate and the b(e2 ) s",
    "8 to 6 and 6 to 4 are very small . on the other hand , for @xmath9cr the emphasis was that it was hard to tell which of the calculations agreed better with experiment",
    " full interaction of t=1 only .",
    "sure , there were some differences , but both spectra looked similar  sort of vibrational , but with a tendency to rotation .",
    "the b(e2 ) s were larger in the full calculation , but this could be accomodated to a large extent by changing the effective charges .",
    "although the above works serve as a stimulus for we are about to do , we would like to separate ourselves from discussions and arguments about the relative merits therein .",
    "rather , we start anew and address the problem of how two - body matrix elements affect the spectra of more complex nuclei .",
    "in 1963 and 1964 , calculations were performed to obtain wave functions and energy levels in the f@xmath1 shell by bayman et al . [ 6 ] , mccullen et al . [ 7 ] and french et al . [ 8 ] . at that time , the t=1 two - body matrix elements were well known but not so t=0 . in 1985 ,",
    "the t=0 matrix elements were better known and the calculations were repeated by escuderos et al . [ 9 ] .",
    "the two - particle matrix elements , obtained mainly from the spectrum of @xmath10sc , are shown in the table . note",
    "that not only j=0 t=1 , but also j=1 t=0 and j=7 t=0 , are low lying .",
    "we next make a search for a set of t=1 two - body matrix elements which will give close to equal spaces spectra for even i states in @xmath2ti , and for which all the t=0 ( odd - j ) matrix elements are set equal to zero .",
    "we find a good choice for j=0 , 2 , 4 , 6 are , respectively , 0.00 , 1.00 , 1.60 , 2.00 .",
    "preiviously we had found a partial dynamical symmetry when we set all t=0 two - body amtrix elemnts to zero in a single j shell calculation for 2 protons and 2 neutrons [ 10.11.1,12,13 ] .",
    "the angular momenta involved were those that could not occur for 4 identical particles .",
    "for the states in question one had ( j@xmath11 , j@xmath12 ) as good dual quantum numbers . when we consider more restricitve interactions , still with t=0 interactions set to zero e.g. `` 123 '' in f@xmath1 , `` 1234 '' in g@xmath5 ,  12345  in h@xmath13 we get some selected equally spaced levels which are usually multi - degenerate . as well as the old",
    "we get new angular momenta as part of the eaually spaced spectra.these can occur for systems of identical particles .",
    "the wave functions have the constraint that ( j@xmath11 + j@xmath12 ) is a constant .",
    "this is less constrictive than the previous condition .",
    "ricardo garcia has two institutional affiliations : rutgers university , and the university of puerto rico , rio piedras campus .",
