    "all information about a quantum system is encoded in the state of the system but it is one of the great challenges for experimentalists to measure the state of the quantum system perfectly @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the state of a quantum system is not an observable in quantum mechanics @xcite that makes it impossible to perform all measurements on the single state to extract the whole information about the system . on the other hand no - cloning theorem",
    "does not allow to create a perfect copy of the system without prior knowledge about its state @xcite .",
    "hence , there remains no way , even in principle , to infer the unknown quantum state of a single quantum system @xcite .",
    "however it is possible to estimate the unknown quantum state of a system when many identical copies of the system are available .",
    "this procedure of reconstructing an unknown quantum state through a series of measurements on a number of identical copies of the system is called quantum state tomography . in this process",
    "each measurement gives a new dimension of the system and therefore , infinite number of copies are required to reconstruct the exact state of a quantum system.the problem of quantum state tomography was first addressed by fano @xcite who recognized the need to measure two non commuting observables .",
    "however it remained mere speculation until original proposal for quantum tomography and its experimental verification ariano , vegal , raymer .",
    "since than it is being  applied for the measurement of photon statistics of a semiconductor laser @xcite , reconstruction of density matrix of squeezed vacuum @xcite and probing the entangled states of light and ions @xcite    in this paper by making use of the mathematical setup of generalized quantization scheme for games @xcite a technique for quantum state tomography is developed .",
    "@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 using the @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8it is a step forward for strengthening the established link between quantum games and quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows:- in section ( [ stokes ] ) we present a brief introduction to single qubit tomography following refs .",
    "altepeter , chuang , in section ( [ state tomography ] ) we present our technique for quantum state tomography and section ( [ conclusion ] ) concludes the results .",
    "any single qubit density matrix @xmath8 can uniquely be represented with the help of three parameters @xmath9 and pauli matrices @xmath10  by the expression @xmath11where @xmath12 and the other parameters obey the relation @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath14  are called stokes parameters and for a quantum state @xmath8  these can be calculated as @xmath15physically these parameters give the outcome of a projective measurements as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the probability to measure state @xmath18 given by @xmath19if we are provided with many copies of a quantum state then with the help of orthogonal set of matrices @xmath20 the density matrix ( [ stokes representation ] ) can be written as @xmath21 expression like @xmath22represents the expectation value of the observable . to estimate @xmath23 for example",
    ", we measure @xmath24 for @xmath25 numbers of time giving the values @xmath26 all equal to + 1 or -1 .",
    "the average @xmath27 is an estimate to true value of the quantity @xmath28 by central limit theorem this estimate has standard deviation @xmath29 where @xmath30  is the standard deviation for single measurement of @xmath31 that is upper bounded by 1 .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation for estimate @xmath27 is at most @xmath32the standard deviation for each of the measurement in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is the same @xcite . in this way with the help of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) tomography can be performed for an unknown single qubit state .",
    "a single qubit state can very conveniently be represented by a vector in three dimensional vector space spanned by pauli matrices .",
    "this representation provides very helpful way for geometrical visualization of single qubit state , where all the legal states fall within a unit sphere ( bloch sphere ) . in this representation",
    "all the pure states lie on the surface of the sphere and mixed states fall inside the sphere .",
    "the pure states can be written as @xmath33where@xmath34and@xmath35map them on the surface of the sphere .",
    "any state @xmath36 and its orthogonal component @xmath37 fall on two opposite points on the surface of the sphere such that the line connecting these points form the axis of the sphere .    for the tomography of an unknown single qubit state three consecutive measurements",
    "are required .",
    "each measurement gives one dimension of the system until one becomes aware of all dimensions after the complete set of measurement .",
    "for example , a single qubit state @xmath38 where @xmath39 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ initial state ] ) , can be expressed as @xmath40comparing eqs .",
    "( [ stokes representation ] ) and ( [ stokes ] ) the stokes parameters for this state become @xmath41for an unknown state of the form eq .",
    "( [ stokes ] ) when a measurement is performed in @xmath24 basis it confines the state to a plane @xmath42 ; as shown in fig .",
    "( [ tomography1 ] ) .",
    "then a measurement in @xmath43  basis is performed that further confines it to the plane @xmath44 .",
    "the combined effect of both these measurements restricts the unknown quantum state to a line parallel to x - axis as shown in fig .",
    "( [ tomography-2 ] ) .    at last",
    "the measurement in @xmath45 basis pinpoints the state as point lying on this line ( resulting from the intersection of @xmath46 and @xmath47 planes ) at distance @xmath48 ; as illustrated in fig .",
    "since the resultant state is due the intersection of three orthogonal planes therefore the order of these measurements is immaterial in the whole process .",
    "basis confines the unkown quantum state to a plane @xmath49     basis confines the state to @xmath50 plane .",
    "when this measurement is combined with first measurement the unknown state reduces to a line parrallel to x - axis . ]",
    "basis pinpoints the state as point  that results from the intersection of three orthogonal planes . ]    in the next section we show that how a single qubit quantum state tomography can be performed using mathematical setup of generalized quantization scheme for games @xcite .",
