    "randall and sundrum ( rs ) have suggested @xcite that four dimensional gravity may be recovered in the presence of an infinite fifth dimension provided that we live on a domain wall embedded in anti - de sitter space ( ads ) .",
    "their linearized analysis showed that there is a massless bound state of the graviton associated with such a wall as well as a continuum of massive kaluza - klein modes .",
    "more recently , linearized analyses have examined the spacetime produced by matter on the domain wall and concluded that it is in close agreement with four dimensional einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "rs used horospherical coordinates based on slicing ads into flat hypersurfaces .",
    "these horospherical coordinates break down at the horizons shown in figure [ fig : flat ] .",
    "an issue that has not received much attention so far is the role of boundary conditions at these cauchy horizons in ads . with stationary perturbations",
    ", one can impose the boundary conditions that the horizons remain regular .",
    "indeed , without this boundary condition the solution for stationary perturbations is not well defined . even for non - perturbative departures from the rs solution , like black holes , one can impose the boundary condition that the ads horizons remain regular @xcite .",
    "non - stationary perturbations on the domain wall , however , will give rise to gravitational waves that cross the horizons .",
    "this will tend to focus the null geodesic generators of the horizon , which will mean that they will intersect each other on some caustic . beyond the caustic",
    ", the null geodesics will not lie in the horizon .",
    "however , null geodesic generators of the future event horizon can not have a future endpoint @xcite and so the endpoint must lie to the past .",
    "we conclude that if the past and future horizons remain non - singular when perturbed ( as required for a well - defined boundary condition ) then they must intersect at a finite distance from the wall .",
    "by contrast , the past and future horizons do nt intersect in the rs ground state but go off to infinity in ads .",
    "the rs horizons are like the horizons of extreme black holes .",
    "when considering perturbations of black holes , one normally assumes that radiation can flow across the future horizon but that nothing comes out of the past horizon .",
    "this is because the past horizon is nt really there , and should be replaced by the collapse that formed the black hole . to justify a similar boundary condition on the randall - sundrum past horizon",
    ", one needs to consider the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "the main contender for a theory of initial conditions is the `` no boundary '' proposal @xcite that the quantum state of the universe is given by a euclidean path integral over compact metrics .",
    "the simplest way to implement this proposal for the randall sundrum idea is to take the euclidean version of the wall to be a four sphere at which two balls of @xmath1 are joined together . in other words ,",
    "take two balls in @xmath1 , and glue them together along their four sphere boundaries .",
    "the result is topologically a five sphere , with a delta function of curvature on a four dimensional domain wall separating the two hemispheres .",
    "if one analytically continues to lorentzian signature , one obtains a four dimensional de sitter hyperboloid , embedded in lorentzian anti de sitter space , as shown in figure [ fig : des ] .",
    "the past and future rs horizons , are replaced by the past and future light cones of the points at the centres of the two balls .",
    "note that the past and future horizons now intersect each other and are non extreme , which means they are stable to small perturbations .",
    "a perfectly spherical euclidean domain wall will give rise to a four dimensional lorentzian universe that expands forever in an inflationary manner .    in order for a spherical domain wall solution to exist ,",
    "the tension of the wall must be larger than the value assumed by rs , who had a flat domain wall .",
    "we shall assume that matter on the wall increases its effective tension , permitting a spherical solution . in section [ sec : cft ] , we consider a strongly coupled large @xmath0 cft on the domain wall . on a spherical domain wall , the conformal anomaly of the cft increases the effective tension of the domain wall , making the spherical solution possible .",
    "the lorentzian geometry is a de sitter universe with the conformal anomaly driving inflation , an idea introduced long ago by starobinsky @xcite .",
    "the no boundary proposal allows one to calculate unambiguously the graviton correlator on the domain wall .",
    "in particular , the euclidean path integral itself uniquely specifies the allowed fluctuation modes , because perturbations that have infinite euclidean action are suppressed in the path integral .",
    "therefore , in this framework , there is no need to impose by hand an additional , external prescription for the vacuum state for each perturbation mode .",
    "in addition , the ads / cft correspondence allows a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the cft , in contrast with the usual classical treatment of matter fields in inflationary cosmology .",
    "finally , we analytically continue the euclidean correlator into the lorentzian region , where it describes the spectrum of quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the graviton field on an inflating domain wall with conformally invariant matter living on it .",
    "we find that the quantum loops of the large @xmath0 cft give spacetime a rigidity that strongly suppresses metric fluctuations on small scales .",
    "since any matter would be expected to behave like a cft at small scales , this result probably extends to any inflationary model with sufficiently many matter fields .",
    "it has long been known that matter loops lead to short distance modifications of gravity .",
    "our work shows that these modifications can lead to observable consequences in an inflationary scenario .",
    "although we have carried out our calculations for the rs model , we shall show that results for four dimensional einstein gravity coupled to the cft can be recovered by taking the domain wall to be large compared with the ads scale .",
    "thus our conclusion that metric fluctuations are suppressed holds independently of the rs scenario .",
    "the spherical domain wall considered in this paper analytically continues to a lorentzian de sitter universe that inflates forever .",
    "however , starobinsky @xcite showed that the conformal anomaly driven de sitter phase is unstable to evolution into a matter dominated universe .",
    "if such a solution could be obtained from a euclidean instanton then it would have an @xmath2 symmetry group , rather than the @xmath3 symmetry of a spherical instanton .",
    "we shall study such models for both the rs model and four dimensional einstein gravity in a separate paper .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides an explanation of the rs behaviour @xcite .",
    "it relates the rs model to an equivalent four dimensional theory consisting of general relativity coupled to a strongly interacting conformal field theory and a logarithmic correction . under certain circumstances ,",
    "the effects of the cft and logarithmic term are negligible and pure gravity is recovered .",
    "we review this correspondence in section [ sec : rscft ] .",
    "in section [ sec : cft ] we present our calculation of the graviton correlator on the instanton and demonstrate how the result is continued to lorentzian signature .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] contains our conclusions and some speculations .",
    "this paper also includes two appendices which contain technical details that we have omitted from the text .",
    "[ sec : rscft ]    the ads / cft correspondence @xcite relates iib supergravity theory in @xmath4 to a @xmath5 @xmath6 superconformal field theory .",
    "if @xmath7 is the coupling constant of this theory then the t hooft parameter is defined to be @xmath8 .",
    "the cft parameters are related to the supergravity parameters by @xcite l = ^1/4 l_s , [ eqn : ndef ] = , where @xmath9 is the string length , @xmath10 the ads radius and @xmath11 the _ five _ dimensional newton constant .",
    "note that @xmath12 and @xmath0 must be large in order for stringy effects to be small .",
    "the cft lives on the conformal boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "the correspondence takes the following form : [ eqn : corres ] z[*h * ] d[*g * ] ( -s_grav[*g * ] ) = d [ ] ( -s_cft[;*h * ] ) ( -w_cft [ * h * ] ) , here @xmath13 $ ] denotes the supergravity partition function in @xmath1 .",
    "this is given by a path integral over all metrics in @xmath1 which induce a given conformal equivalence class of metrics @xmath14 on the conformal boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "the correspondence relates this to the generating functional @xmath15 of connected green s functions for the cft on this boundary .",
    "this functional is given by a path integral over the fields of the cft , denoted schematically by @xmath16 .",
    "other fields of the supergravity theory can be included on the left hand side ; these act as sources for operators of the cft on the right hand side .",
    "a problem with equation [ eqn : corres ] as it stands is that the usual gravitational action in ads is divergent , rendering the path integral ill - defined .",
    "a procedure for solving this problem was developed in @xcite .",
    "first one brings the boundary into a finite radius .",
    "next one adds a finite number of counterterms to the action in order to render it finite as the boundary is moved back off to infinity .",
    "these counterterms can be expressed solely in terms of the geometry of the boundary .",
    "the total gravitational action for @xmath17 becomes s_grav = s_eh + s_gh + s_1 + s_2 +  .",
    "the first term is the usual einstein - hilbert action with a negative cosmological constant : s_eh = - d^d+1 x ( r + ) the overall minus sign arises because we are considering a euclidean theory .",
    "the second term in the action is the gibbons - hawking boundary term , which is necessary for a well - defined variational problem @xcite : s_gh = - d^d x k , where @xmath18 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary denotes the outward unit normal to the boundary .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 projects quantities onto the boundary . ] and @xmath21 the determinant of the induced metric .",
    "the first two counterterms are given by the following @xcite ( we use the results of @xcite rotated to euclidean signature ) s_1 = d^d x , s_2 = d^d x r , where @xmath22 now refers to the ricci scalar of the boundary metric .",
    "the third counterterm is [ eqn : ct3div ] s_3 = d^d x ( r_ij r^ij - r^2 ) , where @xmath23 is the ricci tensor of the boundary metric and boundary indices @xmath24 are raised and lowered with the boundary metric @xmath25 .",
    "this expression is ill - defined for @xmath26 , which is the case of most interest to us . with just the first two counterterms ,",
    "the gravitational action exhibits logarithmic divergences @xcite so a third term is needed .",
    "this term can not be written solely in terms of a polynomial in scalar invariants of the induced metric and curvature tensors ; it makes explicit reference to the cut - off ( i.e. the finite radius to which the boundary is brought before taking the limit in which it tends to infinity ) .",
    "the form of this term is the same as [ eqn : ct3div ] with the divergent factor of @xmath27 replaced by @xmath28 , where @xmath22 measure the boundary radius and @xmath29 is some finite renormalization length scale .",
    "following @xcite , we can now use the ads / cft correspondence to explain the behaviour discovered by randall and sundrum .",
    "the ( euclidean ) rs model has the following action : s_rs = s_eh+s_gh+2 s_1+s_m . here",
    "@xmath30 is the action of a domain wall with tension @xmath31 .",
    "the final term is the action for any matter present on the domain wall .",
    "the domain wall tension can cancel the effect of the bulk cosmological constant to produce a flat domain wall .",
    "however , we are interested in a spherical domain wall",
    "so we assume that the matter on the wall gives an extra contribution to the effective tension .",
    "we shall discuss a specific candidate for the matter on the wall later on .",
    "the wall separates two balls @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath34 .",
    "we want to study quantum fluctuations of the metric on the domain wall .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the five dimensional background metric we have just described and @xmath36 the metric it induces on the wall .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a metric perturbation on the wall .",
    "if we wish to calculate correlators of @xmath14 on the domain wall then we are interested in a path integral of the form h_ij(x )",
    "h_ij(x ) = d[*h * ] z[*h * ] h_ij(x ) h_ij(x ) , where z[*h * ] & = & _ b_1 b_2 d [ ] d [ ] ( -s_rs [ * g*_0 + ] ) + & = & ( -2s_1[*h*_0 + * h * ] ) + & & _ b_1 b_2 d [ ] d [ ] ( -s_eh[*g*_0 + ] - s_gh [ * g*_0 + ] - s_m[;*h*_0 + * h * ] ) , @xmath37 denotes a metric perturbation in the bulk that approaches @xmath14 on the boundary and @xmath16 denotes the matter fields on the domain wall .",
    "the integrals in the two balls are independent so we can replace the path integral by z[*h * ] & = & ( -2s_1[*h*_0 + * h * ] ) ( _ b d [ ] ( - s_eh[*g*_0 + ] - s_gh[*g*_0 + ] ) ) ^2 + & & d [ ] ( - s_m[;*h*_0 + * h * ] ) , where @xmath38 denotes either ball .",
    "we now take @xmath26 and use the ads / cft correspondence [ eqn : corres ] to replace the path integral over @xmath37 by the generating functional for a conformal field theory : _ b & & d [ ] ( - s_eh[*g*_0 + ] - s_gh[*g*_0 + ] ) = + & & ( -w_rs[*h*_0 + * h * ] + s_1[*h*_0 + * h * ] + s_2[*h*_0 + * h * ] + s_3 [ * h*_0 + * h * ] ) , we shall refer to this cft as the rs cft since it arises as the dual of the rs geometry .",
    "it has gauge group @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is given by equation [ eqn : ndef ] . strictly speaking",
    ", we are using an extended form of the ads / cft conjecture , which asserts that supergravity theory in a finite region of ads is dual to a cft on the boundary of that region with an ultraviolet cut - off related to the radius of the boundary .",
    "the path integral for the metric perturbation becomes z[*h * ] = ( -2w_rs[*h*_0 + * h * ] + 2s_2[*h*_0 + * h * ] + 2s_3[*h*_0 + * h * ] ) d [ ] ( -s_m [ ; * h*_0 + * h * ] ) .",
    "the rs model has been replaced by a cft and a coupling to matter fields and the domain wall metric given by the action -2s_2[*h*_0 + * h * ] - 2s_3[*h*_0 + * h * ] + s_m[;*h*_0 + * h * ] .",
    "the remarkable feature of this expression is that the term @xmath41 is precisely the ( euclidean ) einstein - hilbert action for _ four dimensional _ gravity with a newton constant given by the rs value g_4 = g / l",
    ". therefore the rs model is equivalent to four dimensional gravity coupled to a cft with corrections to gravity coming from the third counter term .",
    "this explains why gravity is trapped to the domain wall .    at first sight",
    "this appears rather amazing .",
    "we started off with a quite complicated five dimensional system and have argued that it is dual to four dimensional einstein gravity with some corrections and matter fields . however in order to use this description , we have to know how to calculate with the rs cft . at present , the only way we know of doing this is via ads / cft , i.e. , going back to the five dimensional description .",
    "the point of the ads / cft argument is to explain why the rs `` alternative to compactification '' works and also to explain the origin of the corrections to einstein gravity in the rs model .",
    "note that if the matter on the domain wall dominates the rs cft and the third counterterm then these can be neglected and a purely four dimensional description is adequate .",
    "[ sec : cft ]      long ago , starobinsky studied the cosmology of a universe containing conformally coupled matter @xcite . cfts generally exhibit a conformal anomaly when coupled to gravity ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "starobinsky gave a de sitter solution in which the anomaly provides the cosmological constant . by analyzing homogeneous perturbations of this model",
    ", he showed that the de sitter phase is unstable but could be long lived , eventually decaying to a frw cosmology .",
    "in this section we will consider the rs analogue of starobinsky s model by putting a cft on the domain wall . on a spherical domain wall",
    ", the conformal anomaly provides the extra tension required to satisfy the israel equations .",
    "it is appealing to choose the new cft to be a @xmath42 superconformal field theory because then the ads / cft correspondence makes calculations relatively easy .",
    "this requires that the cft is strongly coupled , in contrast with starobinsky s analysis .",
    "our five dimensional ( euclidean ) action is the following : [ eucl ] s = s_eh + s_gh + 2s_1 + w_cft .",
    "we seek a solution in which two balls of @xmath1 are separted by a spherical domain wall . inside each ball",
    ", the metric can be written ds^2",
    "= l^2 ( dy^2 + ^2 y d_d^2 ) , with @xmath43 .",

    "the effective tension of the domain wall is given by the israel equations as _",

    "we therefore need a contribution to the effective tension from the cft .",
    "this is provided by the conformal anomaly , which takes the value @xcite t = - , this contributes an effective tension @xmath45 .",
    "we can now obtain an equation for the radius of the domain wall : [ eqn : radsol ] = + .",
    "it is easy to see that this has a unique positive solution for @xmath22",
    ". we shall derive this equation directly from the action in subsection [ subsec : totalaction ] .",
    "we are particularly interested in how perturbations of this model would appear to inhabitants of the domain wall .",

    "we shall only consider _ tensor _ perturbations , for which @xmath25 is transverse and traceless with respect to @xmath46 . in order to calculate correlators of the metric perturbation",
    ", we need to know the action to second order in the perturbation .",
    "the most difficult part here is obtaining @xmath15 to second order .",
    "this is the subject of the next subsection .",
    "we want to work out the effect of the perturbation on the cft on the sphere . to do this we use ads / cft .",

    "let @xmath48 be the ads radius and newton constant of this region .",
    "we emphasize that this region has nothing to do with the regions of ads that `` really '' lie inside the sphere in the rs scenario .",
    "this new ads region is bounded by the sphere .",
    "if we take @xmath49 to zero then the sphere is effectively at infinity in ads so we can use ads / cft to calculate the generating functional of the cft on the sphere . in other words , @xmath49 is acting like a cut - off in the cft and taking it to zero corresponds to removing the cut - off .",

    ", we need to know how the perturbation extends into the bulk .",
    "this is done by solving the linearized einstein equations .",
    "it is always possible to choose a gauge in which the bulk metric perturbation takes the form h_ij(y , x ) dx^i dx^j , where @xmath25 is transverse and traceless with respect to the metric on the spherical spatial sections : ^ij(x ) h_ij(y , x ) = ^i h_ij(y , x ) = 0 , with @xmath54 denoting the covariant derivative defined by the metric @xmath46 .",
    "since we are only dealing with tensor perturbations , this choice of gauge is consistent with the boundary sitting at constant @xmath55 .",
    "if scalar metric perturbations were included then we would have to take account of a perturbation in the position of the boundary .",
    "these issues are discussed in detail in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "the linearized einstein equations in the bulk are ( for any dimension ) [ eqn:5dperturb ] ^2 h _ = - h _ , where @xmath56 are @xmath57 dimensional indices .",

    "in fact , a degeneracy appears between @xmath157 and @xmath158 tensor harmonics and respectively @xmath159 vector harmonics and @xmath160 scalar harmonics on @xmath125 .",
    "more precisely , the tensor harmonics that constitute the bitensors @xmath161 and @xmath162 can be constructed from a vector ( scalar ) quantity .",
    "consequently , the contribution to the correlator from the former pole is pure gauge , while the latter eigenmode should really be treated as a scalar perturbation , using the perturbed scalar action .",
    "henceforth we shall exclude them from the tensor spectrum .",

    "it follows from the continuation of the completeness relation ( equation [ com ] ) that the sum of degenerate tensor harmonics on de sitter space equals the second independent bitensor , rather then the bitensor that we obtain by continuation from @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , in order to express the lorentzian two - point tensor correlator in terms of tensor harmonics , we must extract this factor from the bitensor .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the appendix for the details . ] .",
    "we denote the final form of the bitensor by @xmath168 , which is defined in the appendix , equations [ bitensor ] , [ app1 ] and [ app3 ] .    the extra factor @xmath167 combines with the factor @xmath169 in the integrand to @xmath170 . furthermore , since @xmath171 , we can rewrite the correlator as an integral from @xmath105 to @xmath172 .",

    "one is usually interested in the expectation of some quantity squared , like the microwave background multipole moments . for this purpose , all that matters is the symmetrized correlator , which is just the real part of the feynman correlator .",
    "gravitational waves provide an extra source of time - dependence in the background in which the cosmic microwave background photons propagate .",
    "in particular , the contribution of gravitational waves to the cmb anisotropy is given by the integral in the sachs - wolfe formula , which is basically the integral along the photon trajectory of the time derivative of the tensor perturbation .",
    "hence the resulting microwave multipole moments @xmath178 can be directly determined from the graviton correlator .",
    "we can therefore understand the effect of the strongly coupled cft on the microwave fluctuation spectrum by comparing our result [ lcor ] with the transverse traceless part of the graviton propagator in four - dimensional de sitter spacetime @xcite .",

    "we have a choice between using @xmath234 and @xmath237 in the bitensor for these values of @xmath132 .",
    "however , to obtain the lorentzian correlator , we had to express the discrete sum [ cor1 ] as a contour integral . since the euclidean correlator obeys a differential equation with a delta function source at @xmath249 , we must maintain regularity of the integrand at @xmath250 when extending the bitensor in the complex @xmath132-plane .",
    "in other words , for generic @xmath132 , we need to work with the solution @xmath234 , rather then @xmath251 .",

    "however , its explicit form is very different in the two cases because the label @xmath132 takes on different values .",
    "it is precisely this description that has enabled us in section [ sec : cft ] to analytically continue the correlator from the euclidean instanton into de sitter space without fourier decomposing it .",
    "we shall conclude this appendix by describing in detail the subtleties of this analytic continuation at the level of the bitensor .",
    "to perform the continuation to de sitter space we note that the geodesic separation @xmath131 on @xmath125 continues to @xmath165 , so @xmath257 on de sitter space . the continuation of the hypergeometric functions ( [ relat ] ) yields [ app3 ] \\",
    "{        however , an extra subtlety arises if one wants to identify the continued bitensor with the usual sum of tensor harmonics on de sitter space .",
    "in particular , in order for the bitensor to correspond to the usual sum of rank - two tensor harmonics on the real @xmath132-axis , one must choose the second solution @xmath258 to the hypergeometric equation , rather then @xmath259 that enters in the continued bitensor .",
    "this is easily seen by performing the continuation on the completeness relation ( equation [ com ] ) , which should continue to an integral over @xmath132 from @xmath105 to @xmath172 of the lorentzian bitensor , defined as the sum ( [ bit ] ) over the degenerate tensor harmonics on de sitter space .",
    "writing ( [ com ] ) as a contour integral and continuing to lorentzian de sitter space yields @xmath260 clearly this is not the correct completeness relation according to the equivalent definition ( [ bit ] ) of the bitensor on de sitter space . but let us relate the continued bitensor in ( [ com2 ] ) to the independent bitensor in which the solutions @xmath258 enter .",
    "this can be done by applying ( [ arg ] ) to the legendre polynomials in ( [ app3 ] ) . by closing the contour in the upper half @xmath132-plane",
    ", one sees there is no contribution to the integral ( and indeed to the tensor correlator ! ) from the second term in equation [ arg ] , because its prefactor cancels the @xmath261-factor in ( [ com2 ] ) , making the integrand analytic in the upper half @xmath132-plane ( up to gauge modes ) .",
    "hence , under the integral both solutions are simply related by the factor @xmath262 .",
    "in addition one needs to extract the @xmath263-factor gained the factor @xmath264 because we have chosen the solution @xmath259 on the four sphere .",
    "the correct normalisation constant for the independent bitensor , obtained from the normalisation condition on the tensor harmonics , is then @xmath265 . ] from @xmath238 .",
    "the completeness relation then becomes , @xmath266 and the hypergeometric functions @xmath258 and @xmath267 that constitute the final bitensor @xmath268 are given by [ app3a ] \\ {"
