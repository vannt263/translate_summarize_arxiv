    "this is the origin of environmental feedback effects described by the correlation matrix @xmath15 in the extended eft ( [ efdt ] ) .",
    "conventional eft ( [ oefdt ] ) is only compatible with states with a positive definite response matrix @xmath31 .",
    "considering its particular fluctuation relations ( [ usual ] ) , this last requirement implies the positive character of the heat capacity @xmath32 , the isothermal compressibility @xmath33 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath34 .",
    "remarkably , thermodynamics also supports the existence of states with _ negative heat capacities _ and other anomalous response functions , that is , a non - positive definite response matrix @xmath31 .",
    "mathematically , the existence of anomalous response is associated with the presence of states where the entropy @xmath35 is a _ non - concave function_. such a relationship comes from the possibility of expressing response matrix @xmath31 as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the entropy hessian : @xmath38 and the transformation matrix @xmath39 : @xmath40 moreover , the thermodynamic quantities @xmath41 and @xmath30 are also obtained from the entropy @xmath42 via the expressions : @xmath43 the states with anomalous response conform the so - called regions of _ ensemble inequivalence _ @xcite .",
    "physically , the anomalous response is a consequence of the incidence of _ non - extensive effects _",

    "direct consequences of the conventional eft ( [ oefdt ] ) are known @xcite :    * the system fluctuating behavior is determined by its own response to the external conditions . * the stable states are those ones where the response matrix @xmath31 is also positive definite because of the self - correlation matrix @xmath13 is always positive definite . * the simultaneous divergence of some components of the response matrix and their corresponding correlation functions at the critical points , @xmath45 , which is related to the divergence of correlation length , @xmath46 .",
    "the presence of the correlation matrix @xmath47 in the extended eft ( [ efdt ] ) introduces the following radical changes in the previous implications :    * the system fluctuating behavior depends both on its response functions and the nature of the environmental influence . *",

    "let us enter into the central discussion of this work : the implication of the extended eft ( [ efdt ] ) on critical phenomena .",
    "our interest is to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of a magnetic system when the same one is immersed into an environment with constant inverse temperature @xmath29 ; at the same time , it is put under the influence of an external magnetic field , @xmath67 , that _ experiences a non - vanishing magnetic feedback effect _ @xmath68 .",
    "this kind of environmental influence naturally appears when the magnetic field @xmath69 associated with the system magnetization @xmath70 affects the source of the external magnetic field @xmath67 and induces the existence of non - vanishing correlations @xmath68 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", it has been assumed that the external magnetic field @xmath67 is weakly perturbed by the magnetization fluctuations , so that , this effect can be considered within the linear approximation @xmath71 ; where @xmath72 is the system size , @xmath73 , the expectation value of the external magnetic field @xmath67 , and @xmath74 , an effective coupling constant that characterizes the system - environment magnetic interaction . in the case of @xmath75 , it considers the equilibrium situation described by bg distributions ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "conversely , a value @xmath76 only ensures the constancy of the external magnetic field @xmath67 in average sense .",
    "the application of the extended eft ( [ efdt ] ) to this type equilibrium situation leads to the following relation for the susceptibility @xmath34 : @xmath77and therefore : @xmath78admitting an extensive growth of the susceptibility @xmath79 with @xmath72 as @xmath80 , it is possible to verify that the self - correlation of the external magnetic field behaves as @xmath81 . from the thermodynamic viewpoint",
    ", @xmath82 does not differ from @xmath75 when @xmath83 .",

    "consequently , there is no divergence of the correlation length @xmath88 for this special equilibrium situation .",
    "moreover , the consideration of a coupling constant with @xmath89 enables the access to _ diamagnetic states _ @xmath90 that exist below the critical temperature , which are schematically represented in fig .",

    "considering that the environmental inverse temperature @xmath41 is increased with and without the magnetic feedback effect @xmath68 , a relevant question emerges : _ what is the system behavior under these two external influences _ ?",
    "the states with zero magnetization , @xmath93 , inside the region with @xmath94 are unstable within the bg distribution ( [ bg ] ) . in this case",
    ", the self - correlation function @xmath86 diverges for @xmath95 when the system approaches the critical point @xmath96 ( where @xmath87 ) . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the system is forced to move along the stable symmetric curves @xmath98 or @xmath99 with non - vanishing magnetization , where it undergoes a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "conversely , diamagnetic states @xmath94 turn stable choosing a positive value of the coupling constant @xmath100 . in this latter situation ,",
    "the self - correlation function @xmath86 does not diverge when the system approaches the critical point @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath101 , the system remains on the line with zero magnetization @xmath93 inside the region with @xmath94 , which implies a _ suppression of the spontaneous symmetry breaking_. thus , the system critical behavior can be modified by the environmental influence .",
    "noteworthy that the incidence of non - vanishing feedback effect @xmath68 can also force the divergence of the self - correlation function @xmath84 at an arbitrary state * p * inside the region with negative magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the occurrence of this phenomenon demands a coupling constant @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the simultaneous divergence of the correlation length @xmath2 and the response function @xmath79 is only admissible if @xmath95 , that is , in the framework of bg distributions ( [ bg ] ) .",

    "the magnetization dispersion @xmath113 can be employed to obtain the inverse susceptibility per particle as @xmath114 . along the monte carlo simulations with @xmath115 ,",
    "the value of the coupling constant @xmath116 is redefined for each calculated point using the optimal value @xmath117 , which minimizes the total dispersion @xmath118 and satisfies the stability condition ( [ stab2 ] ) .    a comparative study of monte carlo simulations with and without a magnetic feedback effect @xmath119 is shown in fig.[study.eps ] .",
    "according to results that we show in fig.[study.eps].c , the magnetization dispersion @xmath120 diverges at the critical point @xmath121 in monte carlo simulations with coupling constant @xmath95 .",
    "conversely , the same quantity remains finite when @xmath122 , which indicates a suppression of the _ long - range order _ associated with the divergence of correlation length @xmath123 .",
    "simultaneously , there exist a suppression of the spontaneous symmetric breaking , which is manifested in fig.[study.eps].a and fig.[study.eps].b as a persistence of diamagnetic states , @xmath44 , with @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "remarkably , the absolute values @xmath126 of these negative susceptibilities are very large .",
    "the suppression of the spontaneous symmetric breaking is also manifested as a _ bifurcation _ of caloric curves and the inverse isothermal susceptibility @xmath127 at the critical point * c * shown in fig.[study.eps].b and fig.[study.eps].d , a fact that gives evidences to the different thermodynamic behavior of this system inside the region with negative susceptibilities .",
    "as already evidenced , the extended eft ( [ efdt ] ) reveals some new insights in the understanding on statistical physics .",
    "this theorem clearly distinguishes two different type of thermodynamic properties for a real system : the _ intrinsic properties _ and the _ relative ones_. examples of intrinsic properties are _ the response functions _",
    "( [ response ] ) , _ the state equations _",
    "( [ var.deriv ] ) , as well as any other information derived from the thermodynamics of the isolated system ; in particular , from the knowledge of the entropy @xmath42 . conversely , the relative thermodynamic properties depend on the environmental influence acting in a concrete equilibrium situation , as example , any information concerning to the system stability and its fluctuating behavior .",
    "the divergence of correlation length @xmath1 and its associated critical behaviors ( spontaneous symmetry breaking , critical opalescence , etc . ) take place at states with a _ marginal stability _",
    "( see in fig.[scheme.eps].a ) . since stability conditions , e.g. : eq.([stab2 ] )",
    ", crucially depend on the environmental influence , _ any critical behavior is always a relative phenomenon_. hence , the divergence of any response function component @xmath128 is _ not an authentic critical behavior _ , but an _ intrinsic phenomenon _ that has nothing to do with the divergence of correlation length @xmath1 .",
    "the above remarks evidence that the consideration of bg distributions ( [ bg ] ) can potentially lead to some incorrect predictions about the system thermodynamical behavior ; overall , when one assumes these equilibrium distribution functions outside the context of its traditional applications",
    ". this could be the case of collective phenomena involving systems with long - range interactions as non - screened plasmas and astrophysical systems @xcite , or , the small and mesoscopic systems as the case of nuclear multifragmentation @xcite , where the existence of states with anomalous response is almost a rule rather than an exception .",
    "before end this section , we would like comment three possible application frameworks of our approach , which could deserve a special attention in future works .",
    "previously , this framework of fluctuation theory have been successfully applied to overcome slow sampling problems in monte carlo simulations associated with the incidence of discontinuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "analogously , the suppression of divergence of correlation length @xmath1 at the critical point could be also employed to design new monte carlo algorithms to deal with difficulties associated with continuous phase transitions .",
    "the second application framework are the _ quantum theories at finite temperature _ @xcite , which exploit the analogy between the evolution operator @xmath129 and the statistical operator @xmath130 . in high energy physics",
    ", these formulations have been applied to study processes that took place at the early universe as a whole , as example , spontaneous symmetry breaking of electro - weak interactions .",
    "since these processes are special cases of critical phenomena , the application of present framework of fluctuation theory could reveal new insights in their understanding .",
    "finally , the analogy between electric and magnetic systems strongly suggests the existence of anomalous _ dia - electric states _",
    "( electric counterpart of diamagnetic states ) below critical temperature of a ferro - electric system , which should not be detected using experimental techniques based on boltzmann - gibbs distributions ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "we think that the ideas discussed in this work could inspire new experimental techniques to clarify the existence ( or nonexistence ) of these anomalous states . as discussed elsewhere",
    "@xcite , the presence of a hypothetic dia - electric medium favors the formation of cooper - pairs , a mechanism that triggers the development of _ high - temperature superconductivity_.",
