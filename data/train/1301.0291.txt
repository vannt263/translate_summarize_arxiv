    "the broad - band afterglow emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , has been interpreted as synchrotron radiation from a relativistic blast wave , which sweeps up a surrounding ambient medium @xcite .",
    "this widely - used analytical model of grb afterglows @xcite predicts a sharp cooling break at @xmath0 in their spectra , determined by synchrotron cooling rate of non - thermal electrons during the dynamical time scale of the relativistic blast wave .",
    "grb afterglow observations so far rarely show clear evidence for a cooling break in their spectra or its corresponding temporal break in light curves with a spectral index change across the break .",
    "the swift satellite @xcite has accumulated 9 years of afterglow data . in the x - ray band where @xmath0 likely shows up ,",
    "usually one or two steepening breaks are observed in the canonical x - ray light curves @xcite .",
    "however , the change of decay slope is inconsistent with @xmath0 crossing , and more importantly , there is essentially no spectral index change across the temporal breaks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inferences of @xmath0 were only occasionally drawn in rare bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the missing @xmath0 in individual grbs may be understood as that the shock parameters are such that @xmath0 lies in between optical and x - ray bands , so that there is no @xmath0 crossing during the observational time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the lack of @xmath0 in almost entire swift afterglow data set suggests that this must be an effect intrinsic to grb physics .",
    "the simple analytical model @xcite assumes that the entire postshock material forms a single zone with the same energy density and magnetic field .",
    "the single shocked zone is endowed with a broken power - law electron energy distribution with a break at a `` cooling '' lorentz factor @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite relaxed this assumption and introduced other factors such as the blandford - mckee ( bm ) solution @xcite , the curvature effect , and adiabatic cooling to describe the shocked electrons , and showed that the shape of spectral breaks is much smoother than predicted by the analytical model ( see also @xcite ) . however , since their model introduces many factors , one could not identify the main source of smoothing .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a detailed study on the formation of grb afterglow spectra , by adopting a lagrangian description of the shocked region ( * ? ? ?",

    "we obtain a very smooth cooling break @xmath0 in the afterglow spectrum .",
    "we identify its main physical origin , and show that a smooth @xmath0 is ubiquitous and intrinsic to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena involving synchrotron cooling .",
    "following @xcite and u12 ( section 2 ) , we make use of a semi - analytic formulation of a relativistic blast wave in order to find its dynamics accurately from an initial coasting phase through a deceleration stage .",
    "then , as described in u12 ( section 3 ) , we adopt a lagrangian description of the blast wave to conduct a sophisticated calculation of its afterglow emission .",
    "the blast is viewed as being made of many different lagrangian shells @xmath3 . here",
    "the index @xmath4 is used to denote each lagrangian shell .",
    "we keep track of an adiabatic evolution of each shell @xmath5 to find a time evolution of the magnetic field @xmath6 of the shell ( u12 , section 3.1 ) .",
    "the cooling history of an electron spectrum is also followed individually for every shell @xmath5 ( u12 , section 3.2 ) .",
    "radiative and adiabatic cooling of an electron with the lorentz factor @xmath7 is described by the first and second term below , respectively , ( u12 , equation ( 17 ) ) [ eq : gamma_e ] ( ) = b^i2 - ( ) . here",

    "the compton parameter @xmath13 that describes a contribution of inverse compton scattering to the cooling rate of electrons is omitted here .",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution of slope @xmath14 above an injection lorentz factor @xmath15 in a fresh shell @xmath5 at a shock front ( forward shock ( fs ) or reverse shock ( rs ) ) . as the blast wave propagates ,",
    "the electron spectrum in the shell @xmath5 evolves in time .",
    "all the electrons inside the spectrum cool down , and their cooling history is governed by the differential equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) .",
    "thus , we use equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) to find a time evolution of a minimum lorentz factor @xmath16 and a cooling lorentz factor @xmath17 for the shell @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    ", we further assume that the shell @xmath5 maintains a power - law electron spectrum of slope @xmath14 , bounded by two lorentz factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as time goes .    more explicitly , when the shell @xmath5 is created at a shock front ( fs or rs ) at the co - moving time @xmath18 , the electron spectrum injected into the shell @xmath5 has the initial lorentz factors [ eq : initial ] ^i ( t_i^ ) = ( t_i^ ) , ^i ( t_i^ ) = + , where [ eq : injection ] ( t^ ) = 1 + _ e . here",

    "however , @xmath26 can also happen for fast cooling , which corresponds to the fast cooling regime ( @xmath27 ) in the context of @xcite . ]",

( 5 ) the microphysics parameters are adopted as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( for slow cooling ) or @xmath43 ( for fast cooling ) . in the following , we perform calculations under the assumptions of two different pressure profiles across the blast wave : a constant profile (  2.1 ) and a blandford - mckee ( bm ) profile (  2.2 ) .",
    "we find the blast wave dynamics of the fiducial example above , by making use of @xcite and u12 ( section 2 ) .",
    "it is found that the rs is short - lived , as expected , vanishing at around @xmath44 s. once the rs has crossed the ejecta , the blast wave deceleration transitions to and then agrees with the bm solution . during the transition phase ,",
    "the deceleration ( viewed as a function of radius @xmath45 ) is slightly slower than the bm solution , ) is slightly faster than the bm case .",
    "for this reason , in figure  [ fig : f3 ] below , the separation between two injection breaks at @xmath46 s and @xmath47 s is slightly wider than that expected from the bm deceleration . ]",
    "since the pressure profile is being lowered into the bm profile and thermal ( internal ) energy contained there is being adiabatically converted into kinetic bulk motion .",
    "as the rs is short - lived here , we focus on the fs afterglow spectra from the fs shocked region ( i.e. , region 2 ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath48 of @xmath5 at any co - moving time @xmath8 ( @xmath49 ) is found following u12 ( section 3.1 ) while assuming , for simplicity , a constant profile of pressure over region 2 , i.e. , @xmath50 for all shocked shells @xmath3 in region 2 at every co - moving time @xmath8 . here",

    ", we obtain the lorentz factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 of each shell @xmath5 at time @xmath23 .",
    "taking also into account the equal - arrival - time `` curvature effect '' of spherical shells , the doppler boosting of radial bulk motion , and different radii @xmath52 of individual shells ( u12 , section 3.3 ) , we calculate the fs afterglow spectra for the fiducial example above . the result is shown in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . for panels",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , we use @xmath42 ( slow cooling ) , and for panels ( c ) and ( d ) , we use @xmath53 ( fast cooling ) .",
    "the upper panels ( a ) and ( c ) show the instantaneous afterglow spectra at observer times @xmath54 , and @xmath55 s , and the lower panels ( b ) and ( d ) show a time evolution of spectral indices @xmath56 ( with a convention , @xmath57 ) at 1 kev and _ r _ band . as shown in panel ( a ) , the afterglow spectra displays a very mild and smooth transition over a few orders of magnitude in frequency or energy in the vicinity of a cooling break . in particular , the spectral indices shown in panel ( b ) highlight that a transition from @xmath58 spectral regime to @xmath59 segment is very slow and takes several orders of magnitude in observer time @xmath60 . the outcome in panels ( c ) and ( d ) ( fast cooling )",
    "is even more interesting .",
    "an expected transition from @xmath61 to @xmath62 is not present .",
    "the characteristic spectral segment with @xmath62 is not even reproduced . instead , an almost flat ( @xmath63 ) spectral segment is observed at around the optical bands .    in an effort of identifying the main source of this smoothness ,",
    "we first remove the curvature effect and place all the shocked shells at the same radius @xmath64 where the fs is located .",
    "all other steps of the calculations remain the same as above .",
    "we find the afterglow spectra again for the fiducial example , and show the result in figure  [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "as shown in panel ( a ) , the injection break @xmath65 is now sharper than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , which can also be seen in panel ( b ) by noticing that the transition from @xmath61 to @xmath58 regime is faster than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the injection break @xmath65 in panels ( c ) and ( d ) ( fast cooling ) is also more visible than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ; panel ( d ) exhibits a sharper feature between @xmath62 regime and @xmath59 regime .",
    "however , the afterglow spectra in panel ( a ) still exhibit a very mild and smooth cooling break .",
    "the spectral indices in panel ( b ) show that the transition from @xmath58 to @xmath59 segment is just as slow as in figure  [ fig : f1 ] and still takes several orders of magnitude in observer time @xmath60 .",
    "thus , this is also an indication that the curvature effect is nearly negligible in smoothing out a break if the break is already sufficiently smooth .    for panels ( c ) and ( d ) ( fast cooling ) ,",
    "the expected transition from @xmath61 to @xmath62 regime is not present again ; the characteristic fast - cooling segment with @xmath62 is not reproduced .",
    "the nearly flat ( @xmath63 ) spectral segment at around the optical bands is now more visible than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "this is because the standard fast - cooling synchrotron spectrum with index @xmath62 below the injection frequency @xcite , which has been widely believed , is not valid for a general problem involving a non - steady state electron spectrum of the emitting region , which we recently showed in the context of grb prompt emission @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , the standard fast cooling spectrum is valid only for a steady state electron distribution , which may be achieved when a constant strength of magnetic field is invoked for the emitting region . however , in a rapidly expanding source such as for grb prompt emission , the magnetic field strength in the emitting region can not be preserved as a constant .",
    "the same is also true for grb afterglow radiation , since the blast wave is decelerating .",
    "@xcite showed that , for such a system with a decreasing magnetic field in the region , the fast cooling electron distribution is not in a steady state , forming a significantly harder spectrum than the standard one .",
    "the resulting synchrotron photon spectrum is also significantly harder than the standard one with @xmath62 , naturally yielding a nearly flat ( @xmath63 ) spectral segment below the injection frequency .",
    "a more detailed investigation regarding this fast cooling spectrum in the context of grb afterglow emission will be presented in a different paper .",
    "since the curvature effect is not the main source of smoothing the cooling break , the next source we suspect is the adiabatic cooling term included in equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) .",
    "dropping out this term from equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) and integrating it from @xmath18 to @xmath23 , we get [ eq : no_adiabatic ] = _",
    "t_i^^t_j^ ^2 dt^ , for @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , since @xmath66 . for the same fiducial example , we calculate the afterglow spectra while making use of equation ( [ eq : no_adiabatic ] ) instead of equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) in the calculation of @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting afterglow spectra are not very different from those shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "thus , the adiabatic cooling term in equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) is not the main source of this slow transition through the cooling break .",
    "the analytical method of @xcite uses the instantaneous @xmath1 to estimate the cooling time scale , which implicitly assumes that the magnetic field strength @xmath1 did not evolve during the dynamical evolution of the blast wave . to check whether this is the main source of discrepancy , we take the @xmath67 term out of the integration in equation ( [ eq : no_adiabatic ] ) . using its current value @xmath68 at time @xmath23 , we get [ eq : spn ] = ^2 ( t_j^-t_i^ ) , which resembles the widely used expression for @xmath69 of sari et al . (",
    "1998 ) , their equation ( 6 ) . employing equation ( [ eq : spn ] ) in the calculation of @xmath22 and , for simplicity , adopting @xmath70 ( equation ( 3 ) ) in all shocked",
    "shells @xmath3 , we find the fs afterglow spectra for the fiducial example .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) now displays a considerably sharp cooling break .",
    "thus , using equation ( [ eq : spn ] ) and based on the lagrangian description of the blast wave , we closely reproduce the analytical afterglow spectra shown in sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) ( fast cooling ) indicate that the predicted spectral segment with @xmath62 is still not recovered .",
    "@xcite , in particular , our model [ a ] there , reproduced the standard fast cooling spectrum with @xmath62 , ( i ) by assuming a constant strength of magnetic field @xmath1 in the emitting region , ( ii ) by adopting a constant injection rate @xmath71 of accelerated electrons , and ( iii ) by essentially following cooling of all the electrons inside the spectrum individually .",
    "here ( i ) and ( ii ) are to assure that the global electron spectrum of the emitting region remains in a steady - state , and ( iii ) is to accurately follow a time evolution of the entire electron spectrum shape in each injection shell .",
    "equation ( [ eq : spn ] ) would play a similar role as ( i ) does , since @xmath1 is taken out of the time integration .",
    "however , for this afterglow calculation , we do not keep a constant injection rate @xmath71 , since it is determined by the blast wave dynamics . also , as mentioned earlier , we do not follow cooling of all the electrons inside the spectrum . for simplicity ,",
    "we only follow the time evolution of two lorentz factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 for each shell @xmath5 , and then assume that the shell @xmath5 maintains a power - law distribution of slope @xmath14 between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . these two issues ( ii ) and ( iii ) would become potential reasons why the standard spectral segment @xmath62 is not fully recovered here .",
    "this will be further investigated in a different paper .",
    "thus , we have identified the main source of the smooth cooling break .",
    "the approach made above to get equation ( [ eq : spn ] ) from equation ( [ eq : no_adiabatic ] ) can not be justified , since the magnetic field strength @xmath6 in the shell @xmath5 must be a time - dependent quantity .",
    "this requires an integration of @xmath72 over time in order to correctly follow the cooling history of electrons in the shell @xmath5 , as is described by equation ( [ eq : no_adiabatic ] ) .",
    "after the rs crosses the ejecta , it is expected that the blast wave would be adjusted to the blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) self - similar profile @xcite .",
    "@xcite also obtained smooth spectral breaks in their detailed numerical modeling .",
    "their model invokes the evolution of magnetic fields in the emission region , curvature effect , and the bm density / lorentz factor profile of the blast wave . in order to investigate the effect of bm profiles on the shape of afterglow spectra",
    ", we now take into account the bm profiles in our numerical calculations .",
    "the fiducial example above has a short - lived rs .",
    "thus , once the rs crosses the end of the ejecta , we fully adopt the bm profiles in our numerical code .",
    "for a power - law profile of the ambient medium density , @xmath73 , when the fs front is located at radius @xmath74 with the lorentz factor @xmath75 , a shocked fluid element at radius @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is described by the bm solution @xcite as follows , [ eq : bm_pressure ] p & = & _ 1(r_f ) c^2 _",
    "f^2 ^- , + [ eq : bm_lorentz ] & = & _ f ^- , + [ eq : bm_num_den ] n & = & 2 n_1(r_f ) _ f ^- , where the coordinate @xmath78 of the fluid element is given by [ eq : bm_chi ] = 1 + 2(4-k ) _ f^2 ( 1-r^i / r_f ) .",
    "the fluid element has pressure @xmath14 and number density @xmath79 in the co - moving frame and moves with the lorentz factor @xmath80 in the lab frame .",
    "for an adiabatic blast wave , this fluid element flows adiabatically and should satisfy @xmath81 .",
    "also , the fs front satisfies @xmath82 if the blast wave is adiabatic .",
    "then , together with equations ( [ eq : bm_pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : bm_num_den ] ) , the relation @xmath81 results in a simple and useful relationship @xmath83 ( see also @xcite ) . in connection with our lagrangian description of the blast wave , when a shell @xmath5 is created at the fs front at lab time @xmath84 , the @xmath85 coordinate of @xmath5 at time @xmath84 is @xmath86 since its radius is equal to the fs radius @xmath87 . then , the @xmath85 coordinate of the shell @xmath5 at a later lab time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) is given by [ eq : bm_chi2 ] ^i(t ) = ^4-k .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : bm_chi ] ) and ( [ eq : bm_chi2 ] ) , we then find the radius @xmath76 of @xmath5 at time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) as [ eq : bm_radius ] r^i(t ) = r_f(t ) , where @xmath90 is the fs lorentz factor at time @xmath88 .",
    "also , equations ( [ eq : bm_pressure ] ) and ( [ eq : bm_lorentz ] ) give the pressure @xmath91 and the lorentz factor @xmath92 of the shell @xmath5 at time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , respectively , [ eq : bm_pressure2 ] p^i(t ) & = & p_f(t ) ^- , + [ eq : bm_lorentz2 ] ^i(t ) & = & _ f(t ) ^- .",
    "the fiducial example has @xmath93 ( a constant density medium ) . adopting the bm profiles described above , we calculate the afterglow spectra again for the fiducial example .",
    "first , we find the magnetic field @xmath94 of the shell @xmath5 at time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) following u12 ( section 3.1 ) but using the bm pressure profile ( equation ( [ eq : bm_pressure2 ] ) ) rather than the constant profile of pressure .",
    "second , as we did in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , we fully include the curvature effect ( spherical curvature of shells , the doppler boosting of radial motion , and different radii of shells ) . equation ( [ eq : bm_radius ] ) gives the radii of shells for the bm profile . also , due to the bm lorentz factor profile ( equation ( [ eq : bm_lorentz2 ] ) ) , each shell has its own doppler boosting factor .",
    "thus , we accordingly modify the synchrotron photon frequency and spectral flux density that are emitted from the shell .",
    "third , we use equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) to correctly follow cooling of electrons . the co - moving clock @xmath8 in a shell flows now differently from clocks in other shells .",
    "taking this effect into account , we integrate equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) from @xmath84 to @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) with the initial values at @xmath84 ( equation ( [ eq : initial ] ) ) and obtain the lorentz factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the shell @xmath5 at time @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting afterglow spectra is shown in figure  [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "as shown in panel ( a ) , the spectra still exhibit a very mild and smooth cooling break @xmath0 .",
    "the spectral indices in panel ( b ) show that the transition from @xmath58 regime to @xmath59 segment is still as slow as in figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( constant profile of pressure ) , but occurs later than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] indicating that the cooling break is located at higher energy than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "the outcome in panels ( c ) and ( d ) ( fast cooling ) is similar to that of figure  [ fig : f1 ] , except that the flat ( @xmath63 ) spectral segment at around the optical bands is less prominent than in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . for comparison ,",
    "we show these two results together in figure  [ fig : f5 ] : solid line for spectra from figure  [ fig : f4 ] ( bm profile ) and dotted line for spectra from figure  [ fig : f1 ] ( constant profile ) .",
    "the left panel is for @xmath42 ( slow cooling ) , and the right panel is for @xmath53 ( fast cooling ) .",
    "this fiducial example has a short - lived rs , which vanishes at around @xmath44 s. therefore , two results are identical to each other at @xmath97 s. for the spectra after the rs is vanished , the general trend is that the dotted lines have higher spectral flux @xmath98 than the solid lines , because the blast wave with a constant profile of pressure has higher energy density and magnetic field than the blast wave with a bm profile of pressure .",
    "however , the difference in spectral flux @xmath98 becomes less significant as we go to higher photon frequency @xmath99 .",
    "this is because only recently shocked fresh shells have electrons with higher energy , which could contribute to higher frequency range of spectra .",
    "as for these fresher shells , the difference between two profiles becomes less significant .",
    "in particular , for the right panel ( fast cooling ) , two results are essentially identical to each other at high frequency , indicating that only very fresh shells contribute to this energy range . for the left panel ( slow cooling )",
    ", the dotted lines have an injection break at higher frequency than the solid lines , because the dotted lines with constant pressure profile underestimate the degree of adiabatic cooling of electrons when compared to the solid lines with the bm profile ; see the adiabatic cooling term in equation ( [ eq : gamma_e ] ) .",
    "also , from the left panel ( slow cooling ) , one may notice that the solid lines have a cooling break at higher frequency than the dotted lines , as mentioned above .",
    "this is because the dotted lines have higher magnetic field ( namely , higher rate of radiative cooling of electrons ) than the solid lines .",
    "nevertheless , the smoothness of cooling break in two results is comparable to each other ( also shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "this again suggests that the magnetic field evolution effect is the main physical origin for the smooth cooling breaks .",
    "in this paper , we perform a detailed study on the formation of grb afterglow spectra , by adopting a lagrangian description of the shocked region following @xcite .",
    "we precisely follow the cooling history of the electron spectrum for each individual lagrangian shell , and integrate over all shells to find the instantaneous flux spectra .",
    "we show that this detailed calculation gives rise to a very mild and smooth cooling break , which occurs gradually over a few orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "we identify the main source of this slow transition as due to the different @xmath1 evolution histories of different mini shells .",
    "this gives rise to an additional spreading of @xmath0 for different shells , aside from the simple age difference ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this extra spreading is the main source of the smooth @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that this effect exists regardless of whether the curvature effect of a relativistic spherical shell is taken into account .",
    "it does not depend on the details of the blast wave dynamics or whether it is fs or rs .",
    "in fact , it is an intrinsic effect relevant to a wide range of astrophysical phenomena that invokes synchrotron cooling of electrons .",
    "it is interesting to note that the injection break @xmath65 is always much sharper than @xmath0 for slow cooling , and is usually so for fast cooling , even though it becomes somewhat smoother when the curvature effect is taken into account .",
    "if a sharp spectral break is observed in an astrophysical phenomenon , this break is very likely an injection break , and can not be a cooling break .",
    "simple analytical grb afterglow models predict some `` closure relations '' between the temporal decay index @xmath101 and the spectral index @xmath56 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present the time evolution of optical and x - ray spectral indices to demonstrate the slow transition of spectral regimes , and discuss the implications of our result in interpreting grb afterglow data . </S>"
