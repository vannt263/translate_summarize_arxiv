    "our data consists of 19 pointed observation of a2218 , taken with the 15 micron filter of the irc - l @xcite aboard _ akari _ @xcite .",
    "the data was reduced using the standard irc pipeline , version 20070912 . the pipeline s median sky subtraction was utilized but resulted in dark areas , significantly around the brighter sources . to deal with this issue , and the remnants of scattered light persisting post - pipeline , a further median sky subtraction of the background areas was performed .",
    "hot pixels were masked and removed , and the remaining bad pixels were addressed using an idl sigma filtering routine .",
    "figure  1 shows four corresponding postage stamp sections taken from frame 19 illustrating the post - pipeline output , a median filtered mask , the median subtracted result and the sigma filtered result .",
    "the resulting 19 images were aligned with aladin and idl s hastrom , and then average combined to give the final l15 image .",
    "a 5@xmath0 source extraction was performed with daofind @xcite .",
    "the resulting catalogue was eyeballed to eliminate any spurious detections , giving a final number of 565 sources .",
    "a monte carlo completeness test was performed using an idl routine written to convolve a normalized empirical psf with the final l15 image , to create artificial sources at random positions .",
    "the artificial sources were placed sufficiently apart from one another and known sources to avoid self - confusion .",
    "the test was performed for 80 flux bins , covering the range of flux densities for detected sources within the l15 image . in order to reduce statistical errors",
    "the test was repeated until an effective 18452 sources per bin was achieved .",
    "the completeness test results show the l15 image is 50% complete to 30.7  @xmath1jy and 80% complete to 39.4  @xmath1jy .",
    "aperture photometry was taken at random positions on the final image , excluding the edges and the brightest source , and the results were plotted as a histogram of flux density against number , see figure  2 .",
    "the resulting distribution has an asymmetric tail that signifies the contributions from bright sources .",
    "the combined confusion and detector noise can be represented by fitting a gaussian to the histogram , with a standard deviation of 8.33  @xmath1jy giving a 5@xmath0 sensitivity estimate of 41.67  @xmath1jy .",
    "the mean rms per pixel of the l15 noise map is 2.20  @xmath1jy .",

    "multi waveband data of a2218 was used to identify counterparts of the l15 5@xmath0 source catalogue .",
    "hst wfp2 f450 , f606 and f814 , palomar 200inch hale _ u , v , b , i _ and ingrid wfc _ ks _ and _ j _ images of a2218 were provided by ian smail .",

    "s11 image was provided by myungshin i m and jongwan ko , and a spitzer mips 24  @xmath1 m image was provided by eiichi egami . the counterparting procedure identified an extra 368 sources and 3 spurious 5@xmath0 detections , giving a combined counterpart catalogue of 930 sources .",
    "aperture photometry of the 5@xmath0 source catalogue was taken with phot @xcite using an aperture of 5.96@xmath2 and a sky annulus of radii 19.07@xmath2 and 31.0@xmath2 .",
    "an aperture correction of 1.30 , derived using a growth curve correction method , was applied and the irc data user s manual version 1.4 @xcite conversion factor of 1.691 was used to convert from adu to  @xmath1jy . for the hst images",
    ", photometry was obtained from the published catalogue of @xcite via the ned database .",
    "the remaining images were subject to a growth curve correction method to obtain corrected aperture photometry , using a routine written in idl . for each image one or two mean growth curves were empirically constructed .",
    "these curves were used to calculate aperture radius and correction for each remaining source .",
    "idl s aper was used to take the subsequent aperture photometry .",
    "our _ ks _ band photometry was compared , where available , to previously published _",
    "band photometry @xcite and showed a less than 2% difference .",
    "we used eazy @xcite to gain photometric redshift estimates for our 5@xmath0 source catalogue .",
    "eazy utilizes a minimum @xmath3@xmath4 sed fitting method , which is suitable for data sets with no available spectroscopic redshifts ( zspec ) or a biased set of zspec . in our case",
    "the majority of the small zspec available are biased at the cluster distance .",
    "the theoretical sed templates , used by eazy , are based on semi - analytical models , and a linear combination of templates can be fitted simultaneously .",
    "eazy gives the option to apply priors , aimed at breaking the template colour degeneracies seen with increasing redshift .",
    "a comparison of the resulting redshift estimates for our sources with known zspec shows that applying priors gives an improved correlation of approximately 10% .",
    "our spectra were also fitted using the photometric redshift code illustrated in @xcite , photz from here on .",
    "this code is uniquely optimised for fitting mid - to - far - infrared pah and silicate features seen in starburst seds .",
    "starburst template @xcite and agn template @xcite components were simultaneously fitted by photz .",
    "a comparison of the photz and eazy redshifts estimates for sources with prominent mid - to - far - infrared features shows a correlation of around 0.8 .",
    "differential number counts ( dn / ds ) , corrected for incompleteness , were taken for our 5@xmath0 catalogue and normalized to a euclidean slope .",
    "these counts were corrected for flux amplification by applying magnification factors obtained via lenstool @xcite .",
    "figure  3 compares our corrected and uncorrected counts with previously published differential number counts .",
    "our counts corrected for lensing show an upturn around 2 mjy and peak around 0.4 mjy , in agreement with previous counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the @xcite model .",
