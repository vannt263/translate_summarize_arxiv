    "kepler extracted his laws from the astronomical data concerning two - body periodic orbits collected by tycho brahe and his predecessors .",
    "unlike a two - body orbit , a periodic three - body orbit is characterized both by its kinematic and geometric properties and by its topology , which can be described algebraically by a word , or an element @xmath1 of free group @xmath2 on two letters @xmath3 ( and their inverses @xmath4 ) , see refs .",

    ".    graphically , this amounts to classifying closed curves according to their `` topologies '' in a plane with two punctures .",
    "the closed curves are stereographic projections of periodic orbits from the shape - sphere , with three punctures - for a detailed explanation , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and for graphic illustrations , see the web - site @xcite - onto a plane with two punctures , the puncture at the `` north pole '' having been projected to infinity .",
    "that procedure leads to the aforementioned free group @xmath2 on two letters @xmath5 , where ( for definiteness ) a denotes a clockwise `` full turn '' around the right - hand - side puncture , and b denotes the counter - clockwise full turn around the other puncture in the plane / sphere . in this way",
    "the topology of an orbit can be transformed into an algebraic object that can be further manipulated .",
    "but , even within this particular method of assigning a sequence of symbols to a topology there remains an ambiguity , regarding the question which puncture should be taken as the `` north pole '' of the stereographic projection , see appendix [ ss : ambiguity ] .",
    "the length of the word generally depends on this choice , see appendix [ s : alternative_word ] .",
    "we resolve this ambiguity by using the ( common ) symmetry axis of all presently known collisionless zero - angular - momentum periodic orbits to define the `` north pole '' , which we call the `` natural '' , or `` symmetric '' choice , because it leads to equal numbers @xmath6 of small letters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as equal numbers @xmath9 of capital letters @xmath10 , or @xmath11 .",
    "these relations need not hold with a different choice of `` north pole '' , however , e.g. with cyclically permuted punctures , generally @xmath12 and @xmath13 , see appendix [ s : alternative_word ] .",

    "2 ) as one increases the number of letters @xmath22 , the number of topologically distinct orbits @xmath27 grows rapidly , see appendix [ ss : conjugacy ] , and the number of presently discovered ( and displayed here ) orbits pales in comparison with that number .",
    "the number @xmath27 is not necessarily the same one as the number of physically possible orbits - moore has shown by explicit examples how mathematically allowed orbits disappear as the exponent in the potential is reduced from @xmath28 to @xmath29 in newtonian gravity , ref .",

    "the remaining 22 ( of 46 ) orbits are the new ( @xmath30=5 , 7 , 14 , 17 , 22 , 26 , 35 , 41 figure - eight satellite ) choreographies , ref .",
    "@xcite , that extend up to @xmath31 and thus test the proposed linear dependence(s ) farther into the previously unexplored region .",
    "we emphasize that three of these new choreographic orbits are not satellites of the figure - eight .",
    "the most precise regularity explains two previously noticed , but unexplained identities : a ) the identity of periods ( to 16 decimal places , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; and b ) the identity of actions ( to seven significant digits , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , of two distinct orbits with the same topology , _ viz . _ of moore s and simo s figure-8 solutions , evaluated at equal energies .",
    "the same phenomenon was observed among seven independent @xmath32 figure - eight satellites reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the two butterfly orbits in ref .",
    "moreover , the ratio of periods of two different-@xmath30 satellites equals the ratio of the corresponding @xmath30 s , to high precision .",
    "an extension of this rule to arbitrary @xmath30 predicts the periods , and actions of new , as yet undiscovered three - body orbits and helps one to identify and classify newly discovered orbits , as in ref .",
    "the four less precise linear regularities also predict new families of orbits , with somewhat lower precision .",
    "before we proceed to present the evidence and state the regularities in their algebraic forms , we must first define what we mean by kepler s third law in a three - body system ?",
    "kepler s first law , which states that a periodic two - body trajectory must be an ellipse , manifestly holds only in the two - body case ; his second law , which asserts conservation of angular momentum , holds for any number of bodies , but generally does not have a simple geometrical interpretation as in the two - body case .",
    "his third law , which relates the square of the orbital period @xmath0 of a planet to the cube of the semi - major axis @xmath33 of its orbit , i.e. , @xmath34 , also has a proper three - body generalization , despite its appearance .",
    "as only lagrange s three - body orbits are elliptical , we must address the question what corresponds to the semi - major axis @xmath33 in kepler s third law for arbitrary periodic three - body orbits ?",
    "the answer to this question can be found by remembering the virial theorem , ref .",
    "@xcite , for the newtonian potential and then by using the hyper - spherical three - body variables , ref .",
    "@xcite . as the `` overall size '' of a three - body system",
    "is determined by a time - average ( to be specified below ) over one period of the hyper - radius @xmath35 ; and the virial theorem relates the time - average of the potential energy @xmath36 to the ( constant ) total energy @xmath15 , so it is the harmonic mean ( over one period ) of the hyper - radius @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 , that corresponds to the semi - major axis @xmath33 in the three - body case , see footnote .",
    ", where @xmath39 is the energy of the system and @xmath40 is a constant ( equal to the integral of the orbit over the shape sphere ) that depends on the particular orbit : every periodic three - body orbit passes through a different sequence of shapes ( including lagrange s elliptic ones , in which @xmath41 ) during one period , so each orbit has a different value of the constant @xmath40 , but the validity of the scaling law @xmath42 should be immediately clear .",
    "this amounts to the well known fact that kepler s third law follows from the spatio - temporal ( mechanical ) scaling laws , which , in turn , follow from the homogeneity of the newtonian gravity s ( two - body ) potential , ref .",
    "the scaling laws are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and consequently @xmath45 .",
    "the ( total ) energy scales as @xmath46 , the period @xmath0 as @xmath47 and angular momentum as @xmath48 . ]",
    "thus , we ( may ) replace the `` mean size '' @xmath37 of the three - body system in kepler s third law @xmath49 with the inverse absolute value of energy @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 , or equivalently @xmath52 .",
    "in the newtonian two - body potential @xcite . ]",
    "the constant on the right - hand - side of this equation is not `` universal '' in the three - body case , as it is in the two - body case : it may depend on both the family of the three - body orbit and its angular momentum @xmath53 , see refs .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath53 transforms differently under scale transformations than the period @xmath0 , which is the reason why only the vanishing angular momentum @xmath54 is a `` fixed point '' under scaling . for this reason ,",
    "we confine ourselves here to three - body orbits with zero angular momentum , and , for simplicity s sake , to equal masses .",
    "as stated in the introduction , families of periodic three - body orbits can be characterized by the topology of their trajectories in the real configuration space ( `` braid group '' ) , or on the ( so - called ) shape sphere ( `` free group '' ) , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the latter can be specified by the conjugacy classes of elements , or `` words '' @xmath17 , for short , consisting of letters @xmath55 , that define the free group on two letters ( a , b ) .",
    "thus , here we must study the dependence of the constant on the right - hand - side of the scaling law @xmath56 on the structure of the word @xmath1 that characterizes a periodic three - body orbit with zero - angular - momentum .",
    "note that if we classify orbits using only the numbers , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , of @xmath59 and @xmath60 letters respectively , in the orbits free group group elements , then all periodic orbits satisfy roughly the linear rule @xmath61 , c.f .",

    "note that `` generic '' relations @xmath57 and @xmath58 hold only in the `` natural '' or symmetric choice of stereographic projection ( see the introduction and appendix [ ss : ambiguity ] ) and that , due to the time - reversal symmetry of the solutions , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 may be interchanged .",
