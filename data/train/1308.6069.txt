    "variable selection methods based on penalty theory have received great attention in high - dimensional data analysis .",
    "a principled approach is due to the lasso of @xcite , which uses the @xmath0-norm penalty .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the lasso estimate can be viewed as the mode of the posterior distribution .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 penalty can be transformed into the laplace prior . moreover , this prior can be expressed as a gaussian scale mixture .",
    "this has thus led to bayesian developments of the lasso and its variants  @xcite .",
    "there has also been work on nonconvex penalization under a parametric bayesian framework .",
    "@xcite derived their local linear approximation ( lla ) algorithm by combining the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm with an inverse laplace transform .",
    "in particular , they showed that the @xmath2 penalty with @xmath3 can be obtained by mixing the laplace distribution with a stable density .",
    "other authors have shown that the prior induced from a penalty , called the nonconvex log penalty and defined in equation ( [ eqn : logp ] ) below , has an interpretation as a scale mixture of laplace distributions with an inverse gamma mixing distribution  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite extended this class of laplace variance mixtures by using a generalized inverse gaussian mixing distribution .",
    "related methods include the bayesian hyper - lasso  @xcite , the horseshoe model  @xcite and the dirichlet laplace prior  @xcite .    in parallel ,",
    "nonparametric bayesian approaches have been applied to variable selection  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the infinite gamma poisson model  @xcite negative binomial processes are used to describe non - negative integer valued matrices , yielding a nonparametric bayesian feature selection approach under an unsupervised learning setting .",
    "the beta - bernoulli process provides a nonparametric bayesian tool in sparsity modeling  @xcite . additionally , @xcite proposed a nonparametric approach for normal variance mixtures and showed that the approach is closely related to lvy processes .",
    "later on , @xcite constructed sparse priors using increments of subordinators , which embeds finite dimensional normal variance mixtures in infinite ones .",
    "thus , this provides a new framework for the construction of sparsity - inducing priors .",
    "specifically , @xcite discussed the use of @xmath4-stable subordinators and inverted - beta subordinators for modeling joint priors of regression coefficients . @xcite",
    "established the connection of two nonconvex penalty functions , which are referred to as log and exp and defined in equations ( [ eqn : logp ] ) and ( [ eqn : exp ] ) below , with the laplace transforms of the gamma and poisson subordinators .",
    "a subordinator is a one - dimensional lvy process that is almost surely non - decreasing  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further study the application of subordinators in bayesian nonconvex penalization problems under supervised learning scenarios .",
    "differing from the previous treatments , we model latent shrinkage parameters using subordinators which are defined as stochastic processes of regularization parameters .",
    "in particular , we consider two families of compound poisson subordinators : continuous compound poisson subordinators based on a gamma random variable  @xcite and discrete compound poisson subordinators based on a logarithmic random variable  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lvy measures are generalized gamma  @xcite and poisson measures , respectively .",
    "we show that both the gamma and poisson subordinators are limiting cases of these two families of the compound poisson subordinators .",
    "since the laplace exponent of a subordinator is a bernstein function , we have two families of nonconvex penalty functions , whose limiting cases are the nonconvex log and exp . additionally , these two families of nonconvex penalty functions can be defined via composition of log and exp , while the continuous and discrete compound poisson subordinators are mixtures of gamma and poisson processes .",
    "recall that the latent shrinkage parameter is a stochastic process of the regularization parameter .",
    "we formulate a hierarchical model with multiple regularization parameters , giving rise to a bayesian approach for nonconvex penalization . to reduce computational expenses",
    ", we devise an ecme ( for  expectation / conditional maximization either \" ) algorithm @xcite which can adaptively adjust the local regularization parameters in finding the sparse solution simultaneously .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : levy ] reviews the use of lvy processes in bayesian sparse learning problems . in section  [ sec : gps ] we study two families of compound poisson processes . in section  [ sec : blrm ] we apply the lvy processes to bayesian linear regression and devise an ecme algorithm for finding the sparse solution .",
