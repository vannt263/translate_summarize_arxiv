    "whereas the research of low dimensional chaos provided us with important notion of unpredictability in deterministic systems , it was soon realized that many natural systems are much more complicated than the low dimensional chaos .",
    "one of the important features in such system is high dimensionality .",
    "although there remains deterministic aspects in the high dimensional chaos , the present nonlinear dynamics tools are not sufficient to distinguish it clearly from noise .",
    "hence , the study of high - dimensional chaos is important both from theoretical and practical points of views .",
    "globally coupled dynamical systems , which consist of many dynamical elements interacting all - to - all , are a good example to develop notions in high dimensional systems .",
    "such a class of dynamical systems is seen in physical , chemical and biological systems . in physics ,",
    "coupled josephson junction array@xcite is a coupled nonlinear oscillator circuit with a global feedback . in nonlinear optics with multi - mode",
    "excitation@xcite many modes are often coupled globally through energy currency . in bioscience and medical science , neural@xcite , cellular@xcite , and",
    "vital@xcite organizations are considered as a network of active elements which are known to exhibit complex chaotic behaviors .",
    "several examples in ecological and economic systems are also considered as a network of active agents .",
    "globally coupled dynamical systems is the simplest model among these complex network of active elements .",
    "so far , study of globally coupled dynamical systems has revealed novel concepts@xcite such as clustering , chaotic itinerancy , and partial ordering . in particular , study of collective dynamics has gathered much attention .",
    "when the interactions between elements are small enough , each element oscillates independently without synchronization between them . therefore the degrees of freedom of the system are effectively proportional to the system size .",
    "if each element has chaotic dynamics , the system may be thought as high dimensional chaotic state .",
    "even in such a case , a macroscopic variable show some kind of complicated dynamics rather than noise , ranging from low - dimensional torus to high - dimensional chaos@xcite .",
    "this may imply that any weak interaction between active elements necessarily brings some sort of correlation among them .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the nature of such collective motion adopting a globally coupled map@xcite , and present a mechanism for the origin of such collective dynamics . with the change of the control parameters , collective dynamics shows some sort of bifurcation .",
    "we present how elements are organized to show the bifurcation structure in the collective dynamics .    in section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "globally coupled logistic map is introduced and its characteristic phenomena are presented as a brief review . in section [ sec : phenomena ] , an overview of different kind of collective dynamics in the desynchronized state of globally coupled logistic maps is presented . in macroscopic dynamics ,",
    "lower dimensional motion and much longer time scale than that of microscopic dynamics are observed .",
    "our interest is focused on the thermodynamic limit of such collective behavior . in section [ sec : thermo ] , the time scale and the amplitude of collective motion are studied in the limit of large system size . in section [ sec : phasedia ] , global phase diagram in the parameter space is presented . while the phase diagram shows a complicated structure , tongue - like",
    "bifurcation structures are clarified by introducing a scaled nonlinearity parameter .",
    "collective dynamics with a larger amplitude exists in each tongue structure that corresponds to a periodic window in the single logistic map .",
    "the elements are accumulated to few bands corresponding to the window for a small coupling .",
    "since windows exist in any neighborhood in the parameter space , the clarification of the collective dynamics with such bands is necessary to understand the collective dynamics in general .",
    "thus we focus on such tongue structures in section [ sec : selfconsistent ] , to reveal a mechanism of collective dynamics , where internal bifurcation of elements plays a key role . in section",
    "[ sec : bif ] , bifurcation of tongue structure is studied in connection with the internal bifurcation . even within the same tongue structure",
    ", we can observe different types of collective motion .",
    "the growth of tongue structure with the coupling strength is also discussed . in section [ sec : hysteresis ] , hysteresis and multiple attractor phenomena of the collective motion are reported .",
    "this paper concludes in section [ sec : end ] with summary and discussion .",
    "in the present paper the following globally coupled map(gcm ) is studied , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the variable of the @xmath2th element at discrete time step @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the internal dynamics of each element . for the internal dynamics we choose the logistic map @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "the logistic map has been studied in detail as a typical of dissipative chaos .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 gives a coupling strength between elements .",
    "the total number of elements denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "the nonlinearity parameter @xmath6 , the coupling strength @xmath7 , and the system size @xmath8 are the control parameters of the gcm .    the gcm can be considered to be a mean - field extension of coupled map lattice(cml)@xcite , in which elements are located at discrete spatial coordinates and interact with neighbors .",
    "gcm can be also considered as a cml in which the spatial dimension goes to infinity .    in the gcm model ,",
    "two opposite tendencies coexist : all - to - all coupling tends to synchronize elements , while chaotic instability in each element tends to desynchronize them . depending on the balance between the two tendencies ,",
    "a rich variety of phenomena has been found @xcite . when the coupling strength is strong enough",
    ", all elements are synchronized each other and the dynamics is nothing more than the single logistic map as is called * coherent phase*. as the coupling strength is smaller or the nonlinearity larger , elements split into some groups , in each of which they are synchronized each other .",
    "this regime is called * ordered phase * , while the phenomena are called * clustering*. the clustering is common characteristics in globally coupled systems , including globally coupled oscillator systems@xcite .    in the region ( called *",
    "partially ordered phase * ) where the two opposite tendencies are somewhat balanced , some part of the elements makes a few clusters , while the rest elements do not form clusters and their oscillations are desynchronized . in the phase space",
    ", there are a lot of `` attractor ruins '' with lower dimensionality , at which the trajectory is attracted and stays over some duration , but then the trajectory goes out from them into much higher dimensional phase space , till they are again attracted to another attractor ruin . in this phenomenon ,",
    "called * chaotic itinerancy * , effective degrees of freedom changes with time@xcite .",
    "if the coupling strength @xmath7 is small enough , desynchronizing tendency is so dominant that elements are mutually desynchronized@xcite(called * desynchronized phase * ) . in this case , in general , all lyapunov exponents are positive and the degrees of freedom in this system are proportional to the system size @xmath8 . in the desynchronized state ,",
    "the mean - field is not stationary , where a kind of collective dynamics is observed . in this paper",
    "we focus on the macroscopic state on this desynchronized state . to see the macroscopic state , the dynamics and statistics of the mean - field @xmath9",
    "are studied as an order parameter . in the next section",
    ", we will show some phenomena of macroscopic dynamics in the desynchronized state .",
    ".75    .9    since in the desynchronized state there is no mutual synchronization in elements , one might imagine that the mean - field would be effectively the same as noise and therefore the mean - field goes to a constant with the increase of @xmath8 .",
    "one might consider that such high dimensional dynamics can not be distinguishable from noise .    indeed this is not the case .",
    "one of the authors has found that the mean field dynamics is different from noise , and studied its nature as `` hidden coherence''@xcite .",
    "a simple solution to such collective dynamics is the possibility that it is represented by low - dimensional dynamics in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath10 ) , even though each element is chaotic and mutually desynchronized .",
    "indeed such examples have recently been found in short - ranged coupled map lattice and cellular automata@xcite , globally coupled oscillators@xcite , globally coupled tent map@xcite , and globally coupled logistic map with heterogeneous elements@xcite .    in the present case , the collective dynamics",
    "is not given by such low dimensional dynamics@xcite , although it has some structure distinguishable from noise .",
    "let us give a few sets of examples of the mean - field dynamics .",
    "fig.[fig : rm.p2](a ) shows the time series of the mean - field as a function of time step @xmath3 at every 2 steps , and the corresponding return map of the mean field ( for @xmath11 ) .",
    "the coupling strength is too small to synchronize any two elements .",
    "the trajectory of the mean - field has some fluctuation due to the finite system size . with the increase of the system size @xmath8 ( parameters are @xmath12 ) , however , the trajectory shows some coherent motion as is shown in fig.[fig : rm.p2](b ) .",
    "the trajectory is rather close to quasiperiodic motion , although the points are scattered around the `` torus '' motion . in fig.[fig : power ] , power spectra for the time series of an element and the mean - field are overwritten .",
    "the mean - field dynamics has a much longer time scale than that of an element .",
    "note that the width around the closed curve remains finite with the further increase of @xmath8 .",
    "the collective dynamics is not on a two - dimensional torus , and indeed is not represented by low - dimensional dynamics as will be demonstrated in the next section . on the other hand , since the mean - field dynamics does not approach a point with the increase of @xmath8 , it is also different from noise .",
    "hence the collective motion has some structure , although it is high - dimensional .",
    "another set of examples is given in fig.[fig : rm.p7 ] , which are the time series plotted at every 7 steps and the first return maps .",
    "in fig.[fig : rm.p7](a ) ( parameters are @xmath13 ) , quasi - periodic - like motion is not detected in the mean field dynamics , but some structure exists in the return map , while in the time series , characteristic time scale seems to exist .    by slight increase of @xmath6 ( i.e. , with the parameters @xmath14 ) , the dynamics of the mean field is changed as in fig.[fig : rm.p7](b ) . in this case",
    ", the return map does not show a clear structure , and the variation of the mean field remains at the same magnitude with the further increase of @xmath8 . with much slighter increase of @xmath6 ( parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 )",
    ", the mean field comes to oscillate more regularly , whereas the motion is scattered around torus motion(fig.[fig : rm.p7 ] ) .",
    "note that the choice of every 2 or 7 step in the above plots is not arbitrary but there is a reason for it , as will be clear in the following sections .",
    "our goal in this paper is to give a consistent explanation for the above collective motion , and answer the remaining questions in the collective dynamics : when the system size @xmath8 goes to infinity , i.e. , in the thermodynamic limit , how is the macroscopic dynamics characterized ?",
    "how does the remnant order in high - dimensional collective dynamics emerge out of the complete desynchronized elements ?",
    "how is a longer - time scale in the collective dynamics formed ?",
    "how does the collective dynamics depend on the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and what kind of bifurcation structure is expected , and how is it explained in terms of dynamical systems theory ?",
    "in the previous section , we have mentioned that the mean field dynamics plotted in the return map shows some structure , ranging from lower - dimensional structure , such as torus , to higher - dimensional stochastic structure .",
    "first of all , to characterize the mean field dynamics , we measure the mean square deviation(msd ) of the mean field distribution , @xmath18 as a measure of the amplitude of the mean field dynamics .",
    "the bracket @xmath19 denotes the temporal average .",
    "since the motion of the mean field is not on a torus , it is not always possible to define the amplitude of oscillation by the radius of the torus pattern . even though such collective oscillation is hardly detected , the above msd works as a measure for the amplitude , and also is useful to measure the variation around the fixed point .    in fig.[fig : msdvsn ] the msd of the mean - field is plotted with the system size @xmath8 . in some case , the msd decreases up to a certain constant with the increase of @xmath8 , but remains constant with the further increase .",
    "in other cases , the increase of msd is seen at some range of size , but then approaches a certain constant .",
    "these show the distinction of the mean field dynamics from pure noise and suggest some coherence between elements .",
    "next , we study the degrees of freedom in the collective dynamics in the thermodynamic limit . in the previous section",
    ", we have mentioned that the collective motion , detected in the return map , has some low - dimensional - like structure but the width of scattered points around the ` torus ' remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the possibility of higher dimensional torus is not excluded only by the figure , we measure the correlation dimension@xcite of the mean - field time series .    in fig.[fig : cordim ] , the change of slope in the correlation integral @xmath20 is plotted as a function of the scale size with increasing the system size @xmath8 . for a smaller system size , the correlation dimension",
    "is increased monotonically with the decrease of the scale as in the case of random variable . for a lager system size",
    ", curves have a plateau at a value less than the correlation dimension two , which seems to correspond to the collective motion . in a smaller scale",
    ", however , correlation dimension becomes large . at this smaller scale ,",
    "the motion is hard to be distinguishable from noise .",
    "if the scale of this regime got smaller with the size @xmath8 , one could conclude that the collective dynamics is low - dimensional in the thermodynamic limit . as shown in fig.[fig : cordim ] , this is not the case .",
    "the slope function converges to a certain curve with the increase of size @xmath8 where the plateau region is no more expanded .",
    "thus , the mean field dynamics does not converge to lower dimensional dynamics in the thermodynamic limit .    to check the validity of this method",
    ", it will be relevant to mention the case with a heterogeneous system@xcite , e.g. , a globally coupled map with distributed nonlinearity parameter @xmath6 over elements , where the mean - field dynamics shows a clear quasi - periodic motion .",
    "the width of scattered points around the tours converges to @xmath21 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "corresponding plots of slopes are given in fig.[fig : cordimh ] , where the plateau at the value 1 is expanded with @xmath8 , and the `` noise '' region is shrieked to the scale @xmath22 . the difference from our uniform case is clearly visible .",
    ".3 .3 .3    to see how the time scale of the collective motion depends on the system size @xmath8 , we have measured the rotation number of the mean field dynamics as a function of the system size @xmath8 . here",
    ", the rotation number @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is angle variable formed by two vector @xmath26 , @xmath27 defined around the average mean filed @xmath28 over time .    in fig.[fig : rotnum ] , the rotation number converges to a certain value .",
    "this implies the appearance of characteristic time scale in the mean field dynamics , independently of the system size for large enough @xmath8 .",
    "power spectrum of the mean field dynamics also supports the existence of characteristic time scale of the mean field dynamics in the thermodynamic limit as is shown in fig.[fig : powervsn ] . while the spectra indicate that the mean field dynamics is non - periodic , there are peaks , which get shaper with the increase of @xmath8 up to certain size and converge to a certain curve",
    "as we have shown in the previous section([sec : phenomena ] ) , the mean - field dynamics depends on the parameter @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . in this section ,",
    "we study how the collective motion depends on the parameters . to characterize this dependence on the parameters it is often convenient to use the the mean square deviation(msd ) of the mean field distribution as we have introduced in ",
    "[ sec : thermo ] .",
    ".9    in fig.[fig : msdvsa ] , the msds are plotted as functions of the parameter @xmath6 for several coupling strengths @xmath7 . here",
    "the system size is chosen to be large enough , to see the behavior of msd converged in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "two points should be noted here .",
    "first , the change of msd is not monotonic with @xmath6 , but is rather complicated .",
    "second , the change of msd is complicated with fine structures , which still keep some similarity against the changes of the coupling strength @xmath7 . for example , a similar but slightly different structure is visible for @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 . in fig.[fig : msd.noscale ] the parameter dependence of msd is plotted on the 2-dimensional ( @xmath36 ) plane .",
    "first , regimes with a larger collective motion form tongue - like structures , each of which starts at some point or intervals of parameter @xmath6 at @xmath37 , and grows with @xmath7 .",
    "second , the growth of the edge in a tongue - like structure has a nonlinear dependence on the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "third , for almost all parameter values , the msd of the mean - field remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    ".85    to see the structure in the parameter space closely , we introduce rescaling of the parameters . for it , we note that each element obeys the following dynamics , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean - filed value at time step @xmath3 , which can be considered as a time dependent input to each element . in this map ,",
    "the nonlinearity is modified by the additional term @xmath39 .",
    "taking into account of this point , we normalize the variable @xmath40 as follows : @xmath41 then the logistic map of each element is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 can be regarded as the nonlinearity at time step @xmath3 .",
    "since the above scaling is time - dependent due to @xmath39 , we define the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 as @xmath45 with the time independent rescaling of @xmath40 , @xmath46 where @xmath28 is mean - field average in time , @xmath47    in fig.[fig : msdvsa ] we have plotted msd by adopting the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 instead of @xmath6 . in fig.[fig : msd.scale](a ) the parameter dependence of msd is plotted on the 2-dimensional ( @xmath48)-plane . the scaling structure of tongues seems to be much clearer .",
    "while the width of each tongue seems to increase roughly linearly with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , detailed discussion will be appeared in  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "when the coupling strength @xmath7 approaches @xmath21 , each tongue structure corresponds to a window of the single logistic map(fig.[fig : msd.scale](b ) ) .",
    "for instance , between @xmath49 and @xmath50 a tongue structure is clearly shown in fig.[fig : msd.scale](a ) , corresponding to the period-3 window of the single logistic map . although there are countably infinite windows in the parameter space in the logistic map , it is difficult to detect the windows for a longer period numerically .",
    "however , it is remarkable that a lot of tongue structures are visible in our model , corresponding to the windows with a longer period .    in each tongue structure ,",
    "further internal structures exist .",
    "for instance , the tongue corresponding to period-3 window of the logistic map between @xmath51 and @xmath50 , has three internal structures , roughly speaking . to understand each inner structure in the tongue",
    ", we will study the dynamics of each element and the distribution in the following sections([sec : selfconsistent ] , and  [ sec : bif ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe how the collective motion is formed , especially focusing on the tongue structure .",
    ".8    in the limit of @xmath52 , the probability distribution function is defined as follows , @xmath53 oscillation , rather than the fixed point , of the mean field dynamics implies that the probability distribution function does not also remain stationary but depends on time .",
    "time series of the probability distribution function by numerical calculation is given in fig.[fig : distdyn ] .",
    "the parameters for the figure @xmath54 belong to the tongue structure in the period 3 window . in this case , since the mean field dynamics has the component of period 3 , we plot the figure by every 3 steps to see the slow modulation of @xmath55 . due to the chaotic oscillation of each element",
    ", the distribution function spreads over @xmath56 $ ] , but the distribution is not monotonous , and has some structure . in the three regions around @xmath57 , the population are relatively large .",
    "this number `` three '' corresponds to the period of window which the tongue structure of this motion corresponds to .",
    "the number of elements in each three region oscillates in time , and the phase of each oscillation is different from that of the others .",
    ".7    it is interesting to view our collective dynamics as an interference between mean field dynamics and individual elements .",
    "before we present a scenario for collective motion , we demonstrate the formation of self - consistent dynamics between the mean field dynamics and individual elements as follows .    for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the case , in which the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 is near the period-2 band merging point(the parameter are @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and the time series and the return map for the parameter are given in fig.[fig : rm.p2 ] ) .",
    "the distribution function is given in fig.[fig : disfunc ] at every 20 steps .",
    "in this case , distribution of elements can be divided into two regions around @xmath60 . during",
    "these 40 time steps the value of distribution function at the left region ( @xmath61 ) , given in fig.[fig : disfunc](b ) , decreases with time , while the other region plotted in fig.[fig : disfunc](c ) increases with time .",
    "although the change of distribution is quite small , there is a systematic oscillation in the distribution(cf.fig.[fig : hist ] ) .",
    "consider a population dynamics of each of the two regions .",
    "in fig.[fig : selfcon](a ) , the population in each region , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are plotted as a function of time .",
    "@xmath62 denotes the number of elements in the region smaller than @xmath64 in fig.[fig : disfunc ] , while @xmath65 denotes that for larger than @xmath64 .",
    "( the definition for each region is described below in detail . )",
    "the population in each region oscillates in time . in fig.[fig : selfcon](b ) , on the other hand , since the mean field has a component of period two , the time series @xmath66 and @xmath67 are plotted at every two steps .",
    "note that the mean field also oscillates in time with the same period as @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , but the phase of the mean field oscillation is different from that of the population dynamics in fig.[fig : selfcon](a ) .    to see how the mean filed dynamics and the distribution dynamics interfere each other , we construct a return map of above two quantities .",
    "fig.[fig : rmselfcon ] is a return map of the distribution dynamics and the mean field dynamics .",
    "this figure implies that a self - consistent dynamics is formed as follows , @xmath70 where each @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a function of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "if the mean field were an external force for each element , the population responds to the mean field value . on the other hand , since population organizes the mean filed dynamics , the collective motion can be described as a self - consistent relation between the population dynamics and the mean field dynamics .    from the above viewpoint",
    ", we now demonstrate how the population distribution is modified as the mean field varies slowly .",
    ".45 .45    .45 .45 .45    if the mean field were an external force for each element , it could be regarded that each element follows the logistic map with external force .",
    "this is valid if the mean field varies slowly .",
    "in this case , the motion of equation for the @xmath2th element is given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 where @xmath77 is difference from @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "if we took @xmath77 out of consideration , the dynamics of each element would be same as the logistic map with the nonlinearity parameter @xmath79 . since in the previous section (  [ sec : phasedia",
    "] ) each tongue structure has good correspondence with a window of the logistic map , here we especially focus on the window structure of the logistic map . in the case of the logistic map ,",
    "the period @xmath80 window starts at the tangent bifurcation point of the @xmath80th iterate of the map , and then the period doubling bifurcation proceeds with the increase of @xmath6 , until the window ends up by crisis(see fig.[fig : logistic2 ] ) .",
    "note that for a period @xmath80 window tangent bifurcation or crisis occurs at @xmath80 points of @xmath81 at the same value of @xmath44 . in this case , since eq.([eq : inteq ] ) has an invariant measure , the probability distribution in each of @xmath80 pieces of regions is equivalent .",
    "take @xmath77 in eq.([eq : inteq ] ) into account as an external force .",
    "the bifurcation of a logistic map with time dependent external force has a crucial difference from usual bifurcation of the logistic map . in fig.[fig : logistic3 ] , examples of the third iterates of the map with external force are shown . in fig.[fig : logistic3](a ) a region around @xmath82 crosses @xmath83 , while two regions around @xmath84 and @xmath85 do not cross @xmath83 . in fig.[fig : logistic3](b)(c ) , while three regions cross @xmath83 , one or two of the regions are collapsed by crisis .    in general , consider the case of period @xmath80 window with external force . since the tangent bifurcation or crisis of @xmath80 points occurs at a different value of @xmath44 , the number of divided attractors can be changed with @xmath44 .",
    "even if trajectories are attracted into @xmath80 distinct regions , the probability distribution in each region is not equivalent .    as we have seen in the previous subsection([ssec",
    ": selfconsis ] ) , slow modulation of the mean field leads to the dynamics of the distribution of population . with the slow modulation of @xmath77 in time , behavior of each element also changes . in other words , with the change of @xmath77 , bifurcation can occur in the effective map for each element , @xmath86 which is the @xmath80th iterate of the map eq.([eq : inteq ] ) .",
    "since @xmath77 changes temporally , such bifurcation occurs temporally . to distinguish from the notion of bifurcation in parameter space , such bifurcation",
    "is called as `` internal bifurcation '' was distributed over elements . in that case",
    ", some sort of differentiation of dynamics over elements enabled the collective motion possible . to characterize the differentiation , the notion of `` internal bifurcation ''",
    "was introduced as a snapshot representations of one system . as we will show below ,",
    "since the temporal bifurcation in an element leads to the collective motion , we extend the notion of `` internal bifurcation '' to identical case . ] . while the notion of `` internal bifurcation '' indicates the slow modulation of the effective map eq.([eq : effmap ] ) , since time dependence of @xmath87 induces asymmetry in this effective map , as we have shown in the previous paragraph , the dynamics of the mean field has component of period @xmath80 motion .",
    "this is why we have plotted the time series of the mean field and the probability distribution function at every @xmath80 steps .    to characterize the effective map at every @xmath80 time steps",
    ", we introduce the invariant measure @xmath88 determined from the perron - frobenius equation , @xmath89 if the mean field changes slowly , we can approximately regard our gcm dynamics as relaxation process of @xmath55 to @xmath88 . in each time step",
    ", elements follow the effective map eq.([eq : effmap ] ) so that the distribution function @xmath55 is going to be relaxed . the elements in the region where @xmath90 are going to the region where @xmath91 .",
    "as a result @xmath55 is going to relax into @xmath88 .",
    "on the other hand , the mean field is derived as , @xmath92 .",
    "relaxation of @xmath55 can lead the mean field to a certain critical value , at which the internal bifurcation occurs in the effective map eq.([eq : effmap ] ) .",
    "for instance , small difference of the mean field induces one point in the effective map to be tangential to @xmath83 , or one region to be collapsed by crisis . as a result , the nature of the invariant measure @xmath88 of the effective map changes qualitatively .    with this internal bifurcation , the distribution @xmath55 is not actually relaxed to @xmath88 , because 1 ) the velocity of change @xmath55 is finite , and 2 ) the relaxation of @xmath55 makes @xmath88 to be changed qualitatively .",
    "consequently @xmath55 oscillates in time .",
    "this is a qualitative explanation why the mean field does not approach a fixed point , where @xmath93 is a fixed point solution of eq.([eq : pf ] ) with @xmath94 .",
    "the fixed point solution @xmath93 is unstable.[foot ] ] at the thermodynamic limit .",

    ". population distribution function @xmath55 at time step @xmath3 is plotted with the solid line in fig.[fig : hist](and see the caption in it ) .",

    "the stability in each region can be seen by the strength of @xmath100 .",
    "the thin lines in fig.[fig : hist ] are @xmath100(see the caption in fig.[fig : hist ] ) . in fig.[fig : hist](a ) , @xmath23 region is unstable and @xmath97 region is stable at @xmath101 as is shown by @xmath100 .",
    "since @xmath55 is going to relax to @xmath100 , the elements in @xmath23 region moves to @xmath97 region as is shown in fig.[fig : hist](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "indeed the number of elements decreases in @xmath23 region and increases in @xmath97 region in fig.[fig : selfcon](a ) and ( b ) .",

    "elements in @xmath97 region move to @xmath23 region so as to relax the distribution @xmath55 to @xmath100 in fig.[fig : hist](d ) and ( e ) , until the next crisis leads to the structure of fig.[fig : hist](a ) , giving a flow from @xmath23 region to @xmath97 .    to sum up , distribution function @xmath55 changes slowly so as to relax to @xmath103 and the distribution @xmath55 changes until the modulation of the mean field induces internal bifurcation structure to change qualitatively . in this example , qualitative change in internal bifurcation is due to local crisis . by the change of stability in two regions , @xmath55 relaxes to a different region . with the repetition of this stability",
    "change the mean field oscillates quasi - periodically .",
    "this mechanism of the stability change in each band holds for any period - p band(window ) regime where elements are attracted to and repelled from each band region successively with the internal bifurcation giving rise to crisis .",
    "as we have seen in fig.[fig : hist ] in the previous section (  [ ssec : int ] ) , one of the two regions in the second iterate of the effective map eq.([eq:2nd ] ) is collapsed due to the crisis at some time steps and such a region changes in time . with the increase of @xmath6 , the time interval of crisis",
    "bifurcation becomes longer . in fig.[fig : bifur ] , the ratio of the time interval , during which one of the two regions is unstable and the other is stable , the two regions are both unstable , and the two regions are both stable , are plotted with the change of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath6 . for @xmath104 , crisis bifurcation never occurs both in the two regions , while for @xmath105 , the time interval of crisis is getting longer . for the parameter beyond @xmath106",
    ", the two regions is collapsed due to the crisis bifurcation all time steps .",
    "hence , the period-2 tongue structure starts at the parameter , where one of the two regions in the second iterate of the effective map eq.([eq:2nd ] ) is collapsed due to the crisis at some time steps at @xmath107 , and ends up at the parameter where both the two regions collapse due to the crisis all the time at @xmath108 .",

    "hence , the edge of a tongue structure , corresponding to a periodic window of logistic map , starts from tangent bifurcation and crisis bifurcation point at @xmath37 , and each line constitutes the parameter @xmath44 and @xmath7 , where each bifurcation condition holds at some time steps(fig.[fig : p2tongue ] for period-2 tongue structure ) . scaling the width of tongue structure",
    "will be discussed lated ( in  [ sec : scaling ] ) .",
    ".8    even within the same tongue structure , we can observe different types of collective motion . with the change of the parameter @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", the collective dynamics shows a kind of bifurcation .",
    "since the collective dynamics remains high - dimensional , it is not described as a standard bifurcation in low - dimensional dynamical systems . here",
    "we study a mechanism of such change in the collective dynamics .    in section [ sec : phenomena ]",

    ", it may be convenient to measure the rotation number of collective dynamics . in fig.[fig",

    ", it may be useful to adopt the invariant measure @xmath114 of the effective map , @xmath115 as we have already introduced in section [ sec : selfconsistent ] . in fig.[fig",
    ": invat7_1 ] , three examples of @xmath114 are plotted as a function of time , corresponding to the three regimes mentioned above . in fig.[fig : invat7_1](a ) , seven distinct regions are stabilized successively . for this parameter ,",
    "the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 is close to , but smaller than , the tangent bifurcation point of the period seven window in the logistic map .",
    "therefore if the fluctuation of the mean field were ignored , none of the seven regions would be stabilized because the seventh iterate of the logistic map eq.([eq : effmap7 ] ) does not cross with @xmath83 . with the mean field dynamics , on the other hand , the effective map eq.([eq : effmap7 ] ) is modified to cross with @xmath83 at a few regions where @xmath116(for instance between @xmath117 and @xmath118 in fig.[fig : invat7_1](a ) ) . in fig.[fig :",
    "invat7_1](a ) , two or three regions are stabilized .",
    "after some duration , these regions come to be destabilized again by crisis ( for instance at @xmath119 in fig.[fig : invat7_1](a ) ) .",
    "after the crisis @xmath114 spreads over the whole region because none of the seven regions of the map eq.([eq : effmap7 ] ) cross with @xmath83",
    ". then stabilized regions switch to different positions .",
    "this process continues successively .",
    "when the parameter @xmath6 is increased , the number of regions stabilized by the tangent bifurcation of the map eq.([eq : effmap7 ] ) is increased ( fig.[fig : invat7_1](b ) ) . in fig.[fig : invat7_1](b ) , 5,6,or 7 regions are stabilized successively .",
    "this corresponds to the second regime in fig.[fig : p7rot ] .    with the further increase of @xmath6 , all the seven regions of the map eq.([eq : effmap7 ] ) always cross with @xmath83 , while some of these seven regions are destabilized by crisis(fig.[fig : invat7_1](c ) ) , as we have shown in section [ sec : selfconsistent ] . with the increase of @xmath6 , time duration of crisis in each seven region",
    "is increased , and all the seven regions start to be destabilized by crisis at the same time step",
    ". then this tongue structure ends up and collective dynamics in the p7 tongue structure is collapsed ( at @xmath120 ) .",
    "then the amplitude of mean - filed dynamics is reduced smaller to about @xmath121(see fig.[fig : p7rot ] ) .    although we have explained the bifurcation in the internal tongue structure for the period-7 case , this kind of bifurcation structure is common to a band region in any period .",
    "for instance , in fig.[fig : msd.scale](a ) with the period-3 tongue structure ( starting from @xmath122 $ ] at @xmath123 ) and in the period-5 tongue structure(starting from @xmath124 $ ] at @xmath123 ) , similar bifurcation structure can be observed , where the change in the number of coexisting stable regions makes such bifurcation structure .",
    ".75    as we have shown in ",
    "[ ssec : effective nonlinearity ] , the width in the parameter @xmath44 of each tongue increases with @xmath7 ( see fig.[fig : msd.scale](a ) ) . here",
    ", we discuss the scaling of each tongue structure .    in general , the effective map for each element is given by @xmath125 with @xmath126 . by adopting the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 and rescaling of @xmath127 , which we have introduced in ",
    "[ ssec : effective nonlinearity ] , @xmath128 may be transformed into @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "as we have mentioned adobe , an internal bifurcation condition , e.g. crisis bifurcation , and tangent bifurcation , is satisfied for some steps within some parameter interval @xmath109 .",
    "( indeed this region corresponds to each tongue structure ) . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath77 varies in time within @xmath131 $ ] for a given parameter .",
    "thus , the minimum and maximum parameter of @xmath44 in a tongue structure is a function of @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively , i.e. , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are given as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a bifurcation parameter of the logistic map , and @xmath138 is positive constant .",
    "for instance , the band merging point of logistic map separates into two lines as is shown in fig.[fig : p2tongue ] . in fig.[fig : scaling ] , tongue structures around the parameter @xmath44 at the crisis bifurcation point of the period-2 window(band merging point ) , period-3 window , and period-5 window are shown . the linear scaling relation with @xmath139",
    "is clearly seen as to the change of @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "thus the width of the tongue structure grows linearly with @xmath140 .    to obtain the scaling of the tongue structure as a function of @xmath7",
    ", we have to know the dependence of msd on @xmath7 . in fig.[fig : dhvse ] , the growth of square root of the msd of the mean field dynamics in a tongue structure with the coupling strength @xmath7 is shown for several tongue structures .",
    "while it has been pointed out that the amplitude of the mean field dynamics may grow linearly with @xmath7 for globally coupled logistic map@xcite , fig.[fig : dhvse ] indicates a possibility that there is a deviation from the linear scaling with @xmath7 for the amplitude of the mean field .",
    "it should be noted that while we have payed attention mainly to tongue structures relevant to windows of the logistic map , in the reference@xcite such window structures in the logistic map are out of consideration . in other words ,",
    "they have focused on the collective dynamics arising from completely chaotic dynamics in the logistic map .",
    "note also that our analysis is based on the rescaled nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 , while the studies in the references @xcite are based on @xmath6 .",
    "possible distinction between the collective motions originated in chaos and window will be discussed in  [ sec : end ] again .",
    ".65    .9 .45 .45    even if the control parameters are same , depending on its initial condition , there can exist more than one attractors of the collective motion .",
    "most straightforward examples of multiple attractors are given with the use of band splitting .",
    "at same parameter region , while there is no mutual synchronization , elements are accumulated to few bands and never change their band(fig.[fig : p3.band ] ) .",
    "therefore , a lot of attractors are realized depending on the population ratio to each band , as long as stability conditions are satisfied . for instance , in fig.[fig : p3.band ] , elements are accumulated into three bands .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for the case with a tent map ) .",
    "the next example of multiple attractors is concerned with hysteresis phenomena of collective motion , which can be observed at the edge of the tongue structure in the parameter space . in fig.[fig : hysteresis ] , hysteresis curve of msd is observed by increasing or decreasing the control parameter @xmath6 with the use of the final state of a simulation at the previous value of @xmath6 as the next initial condition . thus in @xmath141 $ ] , at least two different attractors of the collective motion coexist . in fig.[fig : multi ] , time series and return map for each attractor are shown .",
    "note that , in this case there is no separated bands in contrast with the previous examples .",
    "the third example of multiple attractors , one attractor has a band structure ( fig.[fig : p3.band ] ) and the other not ( fig.[fig : p3.band2 ] ) .",
    "for the former attractor , elements are accumulated in a few bands , while for the latter elements spread over whole range of @xmath81 .",
    "moreover for the former type , there exists a lot of attractors with a different ratio of population in each band , as in the first example .",
    "another important topic related to the multiple attractor is the coexistence of different kinds of element motions .",
    "when the elements are accumulated into few bands , depending on the ratio of population in bands , the motion of elements in each band is different . in fig.[fig : type ] , two kinds of element motions are plotted for attractors with different population splitting ratio into bands . at this parameter , there is a three - band structure , and elements are accumulated into two groups of these three bands .",
    "note that while these groups are similar to clusters ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , but the value of elements @xmath1 in each group are different each other .",
    "depending on the ratio of population in the two groups , two kinds of element motion coexist .",
    "relevance of such coexistence to the problem of cell differentiation is discussed in@xcite .",
    ".75    in the present paper , we have studied the collective motion in desynchronized state of globally coupled logistic maps .",
    "it is shown that the motion with a much longer time scale and lower dimension can emerge in macroscopic dynamics , such as the mean field dynamics .",
    "the amplitude of collective motion ( mean square deviation of the mean field distribution ) is studied by changing the nonlinearity parameter @xmath6 and the coupling strength @xmath7 . by introducing the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 with rescaling of @xmath127 ,",
    "tongue structure has been detected in ( @xmath48)-plain .",
    "each tongue structure corresponds to a periodic window of logistic map .",
    "focusing on the tongue structure , we have demonstrated how such a collective motion emerges .",
    "self - consistent dynamics between the mean field dynamics(macroscopic dynamics ) and each element(microscopic dynamics ) is found to be formed , so that such a collective motion is possible .",
    "this self - consistent dynamics is formed by the following circulation : accumulation of elements into some regions leading to the change in the mean field dynamics , which introduce the stability change of the the regions , and flow of elements into a different region , which , again ..... this gives internal bifurcation in elements and in time .",
    "the bifurcation is also seen in the parameter space . since the nature of the internal bifurcation varies with the nonlinearity parameter @xmath6 in a tongue structure , the number of coexisting regions in @xmath81 changes , which makes the collective motion qualitatively different . hence , in a tongue structure , different kinds of collective motions have been observed .",
    "( a schematic figure of tongue structure is presented in fig.[fig : schematic ] ) .    with the increase of the coupling strength @xmath7",
    ", each tongue structure grows in proportion to @xmath140 , where @xmath87 is the amplitude of the mean field variation .",
    "hence the width of each tongue increases with @xmath142 if @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast with earlier studies@xcite supporting this linear scaling , however , our calculation suggests that the scaling may obey a different power law .",
    "existence of multiple attractors with a different collective motion have also been reported .",
    "this means that there can be non unique self - consistent dynamics between microscopic and macroscopic motion .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of the multiple attractors , since the average mean field is clearly different by attractors , they take different values of the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath44 , and are distinguishable clearly in the ( @xmath48)-plain .",
    "our tongue structure is based on the windows that exist in the logistic map .",
    "since the window exists in any neighborhood in the parameter space of the logistic map and the width of the tongue structure increases with the coupling @xmath7 , the tongue structure is expected to occupy a relatively large region in the parameter space .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we have focused our attention on the collective behavior in the tongue structures .",
    "still , we have to note that there is a positive measure in the parameter space of the logistic map , corresponding to chaos .",
    "hence , at least at small coupling regime in our gcm , there are parameters with a positive measure which do not belong to any tongue structure .",
    "indeed , we have observed that the amplitude of the mean - filed variation drops less than to @xmath144(see fig.[fig : msdvsa ] ) , at the parameter where the tongues structure disappears .",
    "although no clear structure in the return map is detected there , this motion again has some hidden coherence and is distinguishable from noise .",
    "analytical estimate of the mean field dynamics by s. v. ershov , et al.@xcite is expected to correspond to such chaos - originated regime .",
    "however , we need further study to clarify the mechanism of the collective dynamics there , and characterize the high - dimensional chaos .",
    "while in the desynchronized state elements are completely desynchronized each other and all the lyapunov exponents are positive , for some parameter regime , some kind of predictability may emerge in the macroscopic variables .",
    "however , since low - dimensional ( @xmath145 ) collective dynamics has not been observed , microscopic and macroscopic dynamics are not separated completely .",
    "this is why we need a self - consistent description between microscopic variable ( @xmath127 ) and the mean - field . on the other hand",
    ", it might be also important to study how such characteristics of the collective motion are reflected on @xmath8-dimensional phase space structure , or on microscopic quantities , such as the lyapunov spectrum . with such study",
    ", the mechanism for our collective motion must be clearly distinguishable from the self - organization mechanism@xcite or the slaving principle @xcite .",
    "although we have presented a heuristic way to extract such self - consistent dynamics in the present paper , it is hoped that a systematic method to characterize the ( high - dimensional ) collective motion will be developed in future .",
