    "cluster state quantum computation@xcite has become recently an attractive alternative to the standard quantum network model@xcite , especially in the context of optical quantum computing.@xcite there are several advantages of using photonic qubits , including low decoherence , free - space propagation , availability of efficient single qubit gates and the prospect of miniaturization using optical silicon circuits.@xcite cluster states with four@xcite and six photons@xcite have been experimentally prepared and characterized .",
    "recently an 8-qubit photonic cluster state has been demonstrated in the context of topological quantum error correction.@xcite    in order to be useful in quantum algorithms , we need to scale up these promising results to clusters containing tens to hundreds of encoded qubits .",
    "one of the present roadblocks towards this goal is the probabilistic nature ( which implies postselection ) of all the above schemes .",
    "although linear optics schemes ( like the klm model@xcite ) are in theory scalable and universal , they require single photon sources , photon number discriminating detectors , post - selection , fast feed - forward and quantum memories  all these put severe experimental constraints .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to have a deterministic architecture which avoids most of the aforementioned issues and can be easily scaled up .",
    "the photonic module concept@xcite has been successful in showing how large cluster states can be prepared deterministically using a standard building block  an atom in a cavity  and classical switching .",
    "the atom in the cavity plays the role of an ancilla and provides the strong interaction required to couple the photons ( the computational qubits ) . at this stage",
    "it is important to explore several designs in order to quantify resource requirements .",
    "indeed , each particular architecture will involve complex trade - offs between design simplicity , total number of elementary operations and their accuracy plus other technological constraints ( fabrication methods , operating environment etc ) .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this article we explore an alternative architecture for constructing photonic cluster states with photonic modules .",
    "the original photonic module functions as a parity gate  given @xmath0 photons as input , it performs a nondestructive parity measurement on the arbitrary photonic state.@xcite this operation determines the blueprint of the optical circuit in terms of the number of layers and connectivity of basic building blocks , switching sequence , rerouting etc . in this article",
    "we examine an alternative photonic module build around the controlled-@xmath1 gate @xmath2 instead of the parity gate and see how the design changes with this choice .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we begin by discussing the two main approaches for building cluster states , using either stabilizer / parity measurements or controlled-@xmath1 operations .",
    "these two paths lead to different photonic modules which we will call , respectively , the parity module and the @xmath3 module . in section 3",
    "we explore a new network design of a photonic circuit build around the @xmath3 module and we show how changing the fundamental entangling gate leads to a simplified circuit design for preparing a 2d cluster state . in section 4 we introduce a passive switching mechanism and the corresponding network design . in section 5",
    "we describe how our scheme can be generalized to construct a 3d topological cluster state .",
    "at the core of the photonic module is the interaction between a photon and an atom in a cavity . in the model we are considering here the photons",
    "play the role of the computational qubits and the atom in the cavity serves as an ancilla mediating the coupling between the photons . as in the original photonic module concept",
    ", we assume the photon - atom interaction to perform a @xmath2 gate between the photonic ( computational ) and atomic ( ancillary ) degrees of freedom.@xcite this gate is then sufficient to entangle the photonic qubits , as we will discuss in the following .",
    "there are two ways of describing a cluster state and each description provides a different way of preparing the state in the lab .",
    "first , we can view the cluster state as a stabilizer state , hence we can prepare it by measuring @xmath0 stabilizer operators , one for each qubit / vertex . the stabilizer operator of vertex @xmath4 is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are the pauli operators of a vertex and the product is over all nearest neighbours ; thus for a 2d cluster state each stabilizer involves at most five photons .",
    "this is the approach taken in refs .   where a cluster state ( two- or three - dimensional ) is prepared by sending @xmath0 unentangled photons through an array of parity modules ( or @xmath7-modules ) .",
    "a @xmath7-module consists of a cavity with an atom in the center and performs a nondestructive parity measurement on the photons , i.e. , it projects the initial photonic state onto even ( odd ) parity states . to prepare a 2d cluster state",
    "each photon has to pass through five cavities@xcite ( for a 3d cluster state this number is four@xcite ) .",
    "the architecture of the full circuit is rather complex , consisting of several layers of photonic modules and routing switches directing the photons in and out of the cavities .    in the second description the cluster state",
    "is prepared in two steps@xcite : ( a ) all qubits are initialized in the state @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ; ( b ) a controlled-@xmath1 operation @xmath10 is applied to each pair of qubits sharing a link in the underlying graph @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "this puts into perspective the difference between the two approaches  in the first one the central resource is the parity gate , whereas in the second the @xmath2 gate . for photons measuring parity",
    "is in general easier than performing a @xmath2 gate . as photons",
    "do not interact directly , the usual way to perform a _",
    "controlled-@xmath13 gate @xmath14 between the two photons is to use an ancilla ( e.g. , an atom in a cavity ) coupled to both , as in fig .",
    "the well - known solution is to first swap the first qubit and the ancilla , perform the @xmath14 gate between the ancilla and the second qubit , and then swap back the ancilla and the first qubit ; if the ancilla is prepared in the @xmath15 state , this sequence requires only two cnot gates and one @xmath14 gate , as in fig .",
    "[ cz ] ( a)-(c ) .",
    "this procedure has been used to entangle two photons ( the qubits ) using an atom in a cavity ( the ancilla).@xcite the problem with this scheme is that the first photon has to interact twice with the cavity , first to entangle and subsequently to disentangle it from the ancilla , fig .",
    "[ cz](c ) .",
    "this requires a photonic buffer to store the first photon until the appropriate time and then redirect it to the cavity , increasing the complexity . for this the reason",
    "the parity module was prefered as the central building block in previous schemes for constructing 2d@xcite and 3d photonic cluster states.@xcite    in this article we focus on the second approach of preparing a cluster state and use the @xmath2 gate as the main resource ",
    "we call this the @xmath3 module .",
    "the first step is to notice that the second cnot gate in fig .",
    "[ cz](c ) is not necessary , and that we can disentangle the first photon and the ancilla by measuring the ancilla in the @xmath16 basis , fig .",
    "[ cz](d ) .",
    "let s see how the quantum network in fig .",
    "[ cz](d ) works . after the first two gates , cnot and @xmath14 ,",
    "the initial state is transformed to @xmath17 . in order to disentangle the ancilla from the control qubit",
    ", we apply a hadamard @xmath18 and then measure the ancilla ; the previous state is first transformed to @xmath19 ( after @xmath18 ) and then to @xmath20 ( after measurement , assuming the result is @xmath21 ) . the extra phase is then removed by applying to the first qubit a feed - forward @xmath22 , such that the network in fig .",
    "[ cz](d ) performs the following transformation @xmath23 thus proving the circuit to be equivalent to a @xmath14 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath25 is an arbitrary state of @xmath0 qubits / qudits .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 gates commute , we can apply the corrective @xmath22 action at the very end of the cluster state preparation , further simplifying the network .",
    "[ compare ] shows the difference between the @xmath3 module and the parity module , as discussed above .",
    "the difference between the two is minimal  only a hadamard gate @xmath18 on the ancilla after the first qubit interaction .",
    "however , this minimal modification leads to a simplified circuit implementing a cluster state , as we will describe next .",
    "in this section we show how to use the @xmath3 module described above to build a 2d square lattice cluster state . as",
    "this state is a universal resource for quantum computation one can used it to perform an arbitrary quantum algorithm .",
    "each node ( qubit ) in a square lattice has four neighbours so we need to apply four @xmath2 gates to each photon . the circuit architecture",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_active ] .",
    "photons are prepared in the @xmath26 state and pass through two @xmath27 and two @xmath28 modules .",
    "the temporal delay between photons on the same line is @xmath29 ; photons on adjacent lines of the cluster are delayed by half period @xmath30 in order to avoid them arriving simultaneously at the @xmath28 interaction region .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 is large enough such that the full cycle of operations of the cavity atom , between initialization and measurement , is contained within @xmath29 .",
    "each module contains an atom in a cavity .",
    "the @xmath27 modules act on the same line and apply a @xmath2 gate between a given photon and its left and right neighbours . in fig .",
    "[ m1 ] we show a time sequence of this action .",
    "the @xmath28 modules perform the same function between photons on different lines , hence they contain two switches @xmath31 to direct the photons from , and respectively back to , their rails before and after interacting with the cavity .",
    "the two switches @xmath31 are synchronous ( there are both up or down at the same time ) and can be controlled by a single flip - flop circuit .",
    "let s see now what are the resource requirements to prepare a @xmath32 cluster state , with @xmath0 the horizontal dimension of the cluster , equal to the number of time steps .",
    "for each horizontal line we need two @xmath27 and one @xmath28 modules , hence the total number of @xmath27 and @xmath28 modules is , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the -1 comes from boundary effects ) .",
    "each edge in the cluster involves a measurement of the atom in the cavity , hence the total number of measurements is @xmath35 .",
    "as we discussed before , the network in fig .  [ 2d_active ] uses active switching in the @xmath28 modules .",
    "although this can be implemented by a classical flip - flop ( since both switches are synchronous ) , it requires external pulses and additional wiring , adding an extra layer of complexity . in this section",
    "we show how this classical routing can be eliminated completely by using _",
    "passive switching_.    suppose the photons have an additional , non - computational , degree of freedom .",
    "we call it a tag and for our purpose it is sufficient that it takes only two values . in order to have a passive switch , we need two conditions : ( i ) the atom - photon interaction is independent of and does not change this degree of freedom ( i.e. , it preserves the value of the tag ) and ( ii ) there is a simple passive device which routes the photons according to their tag : say 0 on upper path and 1 on the lower path ; equivalently , it reflects photons with tag 0 and transmits photons with tag 1 . conceptually , the network in fig .  [ 2d_active ] can be described in the same framework : the photon time bin is the tag ( remember photons on neighbouring rails are temporally offset ) and the switch is the flip - flop , directing each photon according to their time stamp ( but in this case the flip - flop does not qualify as passive ) .",
    "the typical example we will use in the following is the polarization degree of freedom and a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) : the pbs transmits @xmath18- and reflects @xmath36-polarized photons .",
    "another example is a dichroic mirror which reflects , e.g. , green photons and transmits red ones ( however in this case it is difficult to engineer the atom - photon interaction such that the cavity is insensitive to photons colour ) .",
    "a third example is orbital angular momentum and holographic plates which transmit / reflect photons according to their orbital angular momentum.@xcite of course , one can imagine various implementations of this scheme using other degrees of freedom .    in the following we use the polarization as a tag and the pbs as a passive switch",
    "this requires two things .",
    "first , we need to use a mode ( i.e. , path encoded ) qubit as the computational one .",
    "second , the atom - photon interaction should be polarization preserving ; an example of such interaction is @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the total number of photons .    using path",
    "encoding qubits implies the photonic chip has to be placed between two beam - splitters in the 1-arm of a mach - zehnder interferometer . in fig .",
    "[ 2d_passive ] we show the new architecture of the chip  note that only the 1-rails in the dual rail encoding are shown ; the 0-rails are situated in a parallel plane of the chip .",
    "the operations are identical to the ones described before .",
    "the only difference is switching in the @xmath28 modules which is done passively by the pbss . since in this architecture",
    "all classical routing is done passively ( i.e. , without external control ) , the only control signals are build in @xmath27 modules , as @xmath28 modules are nothing but @xmath27 plus two switches , see fig .",
    "[ 2d_passive ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning another feature of this design .",
    "the modules in the two ( vertical ) layers containing the @xmath28 modules are synchronized so the control signals for the cavities ( initialization , hadamard gates ) can be done by a global control pulse applied to all @xmath28 modules . the only step in which individual control is still needed is the final readout of the cavities at the end of the @xmath2 gate ( see fig .  [ compare](i ) ) .",
    "one can still have a global readout pulse , provided each module has a local 1-bit memory which stores the measurement result of each cavity . with an appropriate design ( we need to take into account the offset between green and red photons )",
    "one can envisage global control of _ all _ modules in the optical chip . in this case",
    "we can eliminate the individual control lines for each module ; this becomes especially important in a 3d layout ( see next section ) , when addressing a particular module buried inside the chip is difficult .",
    "one can think of two different designs for implementing the @xmath2 gate between the atom and the photon .",
    "the first uses a @xmath39-switched cavity@xcite , as in fig .",
    "[ 2d_active ] : photons enter the cavity through the left , interact with the atom and then are @xmath39-switched out to the right .",
    "the second employs the scheme of duan and kimble@xcite  photons are reflected from the cavity ( the lower mirror is partially reflective ) and exit through the same port ( fig .",
    "[ 2d_passive ] , right ) . in this case",
    "an optical circulator redirects the photons to the exit rail . as a consequence , in this variant of the design we eliminate both the classical routing and the @xmath39-switching of the cavities",
    "topological cluster state computation pioneered by raussendorf , harrington and goyal@xcite has attracted recently considerable interest as a fault - tolerant architecture for constructing photonic cluster states.@xcite here we briefly discuss how to adapt the previous 2d network design to a 3d setup .",
    "the 3d topological cluster state@xcite can be constructed from a regular cubic lattice ( fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , left ) by removing the blue qubits together with all their links , as in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , right .",
    "one way of doing this is to construct first a 3d cubic cluster state and subsequently measure the blue qubits in the @xmath40 basis .",
    "the measurement eliminates the blue photons and their links from the lattice , but is not efficient since it involves feed - forward ( we have to take into account the result of the measurement )",
    ".    a better way of obtaining the same result is the following .",
    "suppose we have photonic module which prepares a regular cubic cluster state .",
    "we can extend the 2d module described in the last section in a straightforward way to a 3d geometry by adding two extra layers of @xmath28 modules in order to couple each photon to its nearest neighbours along the third spatial direction , orthogonal to the @xmath41-plane , as in fig .",
    "[ 3d_module ] .",
    "however , instead of eliminating the blue photons by measurement after the photonic modules , we remove the blue photons at the injection stage , i.e. , we run the photonic module with some of the photons missing .",
    "thus the photon sources injecting the green photons run at half the frequency of the sources injecting the red photons , as in fig .",
    "[ 3d_module ] .",
    "moreover , since the green photons do nt have links with other green photons , we can eliminate completely the @xmath27 modules on the green lines .",
    "each green photon will pass through four @xmath28 modules , two for the links in the @xmath41-plan and the other two for the links in the @xmath42-plan .",
    "the red photons pass thorough six modules , two for each spatial direction , in a straightforward generalization of the 2d case .",
    "however , since now half of the green photons are missing , each red photon will have only four links : two links in the @xmath24 direction ( always ) and another two with the green photons , either along @xmath43 or @xmath44 axis . the resulting state ( fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , right ) is exactly the 3d topological cluster state from ref .  .",
    "once prepared , the 3d topological cluster state can be used as a universal , fault - tolerant resource for qip .",
    "in this article we described a scheme for preparing large scale photonic cluster states with photonic modules . in our model",
    "we implement directly a @xmath2 gate between two photons using as an ancilla an atom in a cavity .",
    "compared to the original photonic module design which uses a parity gate@xcite , this choice of entangling gate leads to a simplified architecture with fewer modules ( @xmath45 compared to @xmath46 for a 2d cluster , with @xmath47 the width of the cluster ) and classical switching .",
    "moreover , if the atom - photon interaction is polarization preserving there is no need for active switching at all . in this case one can have only passive switching , e.g. , using polarising beam splitters and photons in neighbouring rails having orthogonal ( h / v ) polarization .",
    "this passive switching completely eliminates the need of an active switching mechanism synchronized with the photons , thus reducing the complexity and the associated decoherence .",
    "another feature of the present design is the possibility of using global control of _ all _ modules in the optical chip .",
    "this becomes especially important in a 3d layout , when addressing a particular module buried inside the chip is difficult .",
    "the model discussed here paves the way towards integrated photonic circuits@xcite on a chip as a basis for future quantum optical processors .",
    "even with a small to medium number of photonic qubits available , such a chip will be useful as a quantum repeater@xcite or as an element in a future quantum internet@xcite architecture .",
