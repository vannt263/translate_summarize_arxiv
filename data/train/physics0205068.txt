    "determining the nature of the highly excited rovibrational states is important in the context of unraveling the intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) pathways in molecules@xcite . at high energies the usual rigid rotor - harmonic oscillator descriptions are inadequate due to the breakdown of the normal mode approximation .",
    "the various normal modes get coupled leading to complicated spectra and patterns .",
    "the underlying classical phase space usually has a mixed character _",
    "i.e. , _ regular regions interspersed with the chaotic regions . the mixed nature of the phase space gives rise to a variety of phenomena , classical@xcite and quantum@xcite , which in turn lead to complex spectral patterns in terms of the intensities and splittings .",
    "much of the recent work@xcite on small polyatomic molecules has clearly shown that the underlying classical dynamics plays a significant role in determining the nature of the highly excited states .",
    "in particular , the various classical phase space structures like periodic orbits , resonance zones and effects like bifurcations@xcite leave their imprints on the eigenstates and hence provide important clues to ivr .",
    "almost all of the work has been constrained to atmost two degrees of freedom systems .",
    "one of the main reasons for such a constraint have to do with the fact that visualizing the classical phase space structures , for that matter even the quantum states , is quite involved for systems with more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , determining the relevant periodic orbits@xcite and higher dimensional objects like resonant 2-tori becomes difficult as the number of degrees of freedom increases .",
    "it is obvious that studying ivr in large molecules from such useful classical - quantum correspondence viewpoints would require one to come up with dimensionality independent techniques .",
    "although not the focus of the present work , it is important to note that novel dynamical phenomena like arnold diffusion@xcite and complex instability@xcite arise in systems with dimensionality greater than two .",
    "it remains to be seen wether such effects have important consequences for the classical - quantum correspondence studies of highly excited states and hence ivr .    in principle ,",
    "once the detailed phase space structure is at hand , the required information can be extracted by correlating with a phase space representation of the quantum states , like the husimi@xcite or the wigner@xcite distributions .",
    "however , given that a detailed classical phase space study of even three degree of freedom systems is sparse@xcite suggests that the straightforward approach is far from easy .",
    "ideally one would like a method that yields the required information in a basis independent fashion without the need to explicitly determine the classical periodic orbits , to visualize the surface of sections and then comparing to the relevant phase space distributions .",
    "the search for such a method , if it exists , seems to be rather difficult at the present moment . in this work",
    "we attempt to provide a first step towards such an important yet difficult goal .",
    "the above mentioned factors clearly indicate that one needs algebraic measures that would unambigously provide the information on the nature of the eigenstates . to this end certain measures , time dependent and independent , have been proposed in the literature .",
    "for instance , inverse participation ratios@xcite ( ipr ) or dilution factors can yield information about the nature of the localization of the eigenstates .",
    "however ipr is a basis dependent quantity and can not provide information about the invariant classical structures relevant to the eigenstate .",
    "it is possible to extract useful information by computing the ipr in different basis which are optimal and physically motivated@xcite .",
    "an explicit expression for the probability distribution of the ipr has been derived very recently@xcite . from a time - dependent point of view",
    "valuable information can be obtained by computing various survival probabilities@xcite .",
    "insights regarding the nature of the underlying classical phase space have emerged from establishing the existence of correlated intermediate timescale dynamics for rovibrational hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "the role played by the various classical structures in determining the nature of the survival probabilities is well known@xcite .",
    "recently@xcite it has been proposed that a dip in the level spacings is a characteristic spectral pattern indicative of a seperatrix in the underlying classical phase space .",
    "this is an important observation for fitting the experimental spectrum with effective hamiltonians since seperatrices are indicative of qualitatively different dynamical behaviours coexisting in the system .    on the other hand , when the system hamiltonian is known , a number of authors have focused attention on parametric variation of the eigenvalues of the system@xcite . in particular , plots of the energy eigenvalues versus a perturbation parameter show very specific patterns for resonant systems@xcite .",
    "it is also well known@xcite that the parametric variation of the eigenvalues of a system can be mapped onto a classical hamiltonian system with the eigenvalues corresponding to the positions of a set of fictitious particles and the parameter playing the role of a psuedotime . within this mapping",
    "the slopes of the energy curves correspond to level velocities@xcite .",
    "thus one associates a level velocity with every eigenstate of the system .",
    "significant progress has been made in studying the statistical properties of the level velocities@xcite and the accelarations@xcite ( curvatures ) . in analogy with the random matrix theory ( rmt ) results for eigenvalue statistics , the level velocity and curvatures exhibit universal behaviours in the rmt limit@xcite .",
    "for example , in rmt the level velocities are found to be gaussian distributed and a relation@xcite has been established between the ipr distribution and the level velocity distribution .",
    "accordingly , deviations from the rmt limit result in nonuniversal distributions signifying localization of the eigenstates@xcite .",
    "the preceeding discussion suggests that it might be useful to explore the possibility of using the level velocities to understand the highly excited states of an isolated molecule .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the level velocity of an eigenstate is strongly correlated with the phase space nature of the eigenstate .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the magnitude and relative signs of the level velocities give a direct indication of the important classical structures that influence the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "theoretical arguments for the correlation and numerical support are provided in the next section for classically integrable , single resonance systems . in section iii the level velocity  spectrum \" of a nonintegrable ,",
    "multiresonant system is studied .",
    "combined with an earlier work on the fingerprints of resonances on the eigenlevel dynamics it is possible to have an approximate dynamical assignment of the eigenstates when the underlying phase space is mixed .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the major advantages and disadvantages of our approach and briefly discuss the effects of bifurcation on the level velocities .",
    "in this section we introduce the level velocity spectrum and provide arguments for the observed correlation between level velocities and the phase space nature of the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "the arguments presented in this section are strictly applicable only to single resonant hamiltonians .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the arguments to be valid for the multiresonant systems exhibiting mixed phase space dynamics .",
    "consider the following @xmath0 resonant hamiltonian : @xmath1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath2 and @xmath3 denoting the standard destruction and creation operators for the j@xmath4 mode .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the form of the diagonal part of @xmath7 is not restricted to the choice made above and can include higher order anharmonicities as well .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian is that of an effective or spectroscopic hamiltonian and @xmath8 corresponds to the dunham expansion . defining the polyad",
    "operator@xcite @xmath9 it is easy to see that @xmath10 = 0 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath11 is block diagonal with each block labeled by the polyad number @xmath12 and all the eigenstates can be assigned in terms of two quantum numbers as @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath14 is an excitation index@xcite whose range is related to the strength of the resonant coupling @xmath15 .",
    "the eigenstates for a given @xmath12 are linear combinations of the zeroth order basis functions @xmath16 with @xmath17",
    ". hence we can write @xmath18 with @xmath19 .    the level velocity associated with an eigenstate @xmath6",
    "is obtained using the hellman - feynman theorem and given by : @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the perturbation .",
    "it is possible to write the level velocity in terms of the expansion coefficients @xmath22 as @xmath23 where the matrix element @xmath24 . at this stage",
    "we summarize the salient features of @xmath25 for single resonant systems .    1 .",
    "the average of the level velocities for states belonging to a given polyad @xmath12 vanishes irrespective of the coupling strength @xmath15 .",
    "this can be easily seen since @xmath26 this fact gives rise to the  fan - like \" structures in the energy correlation diagram@xcite with the variation parameter being @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   the level velocities exhibit linear parametric motion@xcite beyond a certain critical coupling strength @xmath27 . the critical coupling can be approximately determined via a chirikov@xcite analysis .",
    "it has been argued previously@xcite that the asymptotic velocities for a @xmath28 state @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 . in general , one does not expect the resonant coupling strength in a molecule , to be close to @xmath27 .",
    "consequently the velocities , except for states localized at or near the center of the resonance zone , do show nonlinear parametric variation .",
    "however , as an example we mention that the fermi resonance coupling strength in the spectroscopic effective hamiltonian of the chf@xmath31 molecule does come close to the critical value@xcite . for a general @xmath0",
    "resonant hamiltonian it was conjectured@xcite , and numerically confirmed , that the velocity of the state @xmath32 scales with the polyad as @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that through the velocity one is studying the response of the eigenstate to a specific perturbation .",
    "it is not surprising that states localized in or near the specific resonance zone would have the largest response .",
    "that the response is strongly correlated to the phase space nature of the eigenstate is interesting and we now provide plausible reasons for such an observation .",
    "we note that there has been an earlier work wherein similar correlations were observed@xcite .    to start with note that the matrix element @xmath34 yields an expression for the level velocity in the following convenient form : @xmath35 where we have supressed the second index on the coefficients . from a classical - quantum correspondence perspective",
    "it would be ideal to have a semiclassical expression for @xmath25 .",
    "the shifted overlap like structure in the above expression for @xmath25 is strongly reminiscient of the wigner function@xcite . to make the correspondence explicit",
    "the level velocity is written as :      where @xmath37 is the wigner function associated with the state @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the weyl symbol@xcite of the operator @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 note that the wigner function is the weyl symbol of the density operator .",
    "although the system is two dimensional it is sufficient to focus on an effective one dimensional hamiltonian due to the existence of the polyad . thus @xmath42 are action - angle variables pertinent to the classical limit of the reduced zeroth order hamiltonian ( cf .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "in particular , all of the expressions in this section are for a given polyad @xmath12 .",
    "this already suggests the role played by classical phase space structures since it is known@xcite that for integrable systems the wigner function condenses onto the invariant torus corresponding to the eigenstate .    in order to determine the weyl symbol @xmath39",
    "consider @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the weyl symbol of a hermitian operator is real@xcite , @xmath39 is given by : @xmath44 the wigner function is now approximated@xcite in order to elucidate the role of the fixed points .",
    "first the wavefunction is written in its primitive semiclassical form @xmath45 where the index @xmath46 denotes the branch .",
    "the phase and amplitude are given by        where , @xmath153 . from",
    "the above one immediately sees that the classical object takes the same absolute value at the stable and unstable fixed points .",
    "moreover , the classical analog exhibits the identical scaling with the polyad @xmath52 as seen in exact quantum studies done previously .",
    "in fact it is seen in the quantum studies that the resonant eigenstate @xmath154 with @xmath155 _ i.e. , _ state localized on the stable fixed point shows very good agreement with the above classical estimate ."
