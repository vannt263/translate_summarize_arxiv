    "the inflation theory offers an intelligent approach to the basic problems of cosmology@xcite . according to this theory , a rapid expansion era in the universe enlarges its physical length to the nearly 60 times the original size ; this rapid expansion solves the old problems encountered in cosmology , such as flatness , horizon and monopole issues .",
    "the fluctuation of the inflaton , the field which drives inflation , induces the fluctuations in the energy density in such a manner that the curvature power spectrum is nearly scale invariant .",
    "there are several cosmological observations which support this theory .",
    "recently , the planck satellite observed the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropy and its polarization with a small angular resolution ; it results concur with predictions of the inflation theory , in general@xcite .    although the experimental tests support inflation ; from the theoretical perspective , a proper understanding of the nature of the factors that produces the inflation is still unclear . in the simplest model , one field ,",
    "the inflaton which is minimally coupled to gravity , rolls very slowly in a very flat potential .",
    "the flatness of the potential is essential to achive enough inflation .",
    "one way to relax this condition is to change the dynamics of the inflaton . when the kinetic term in the lagrangian of this field is non - canonic the slow - roll condition is not necessary anymore .",
    "for example when we have a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) field , there is a fast - roll inflation@xcite .",
    "brane inflation is an example of this model in which the radial distance between a pair of d3- and anti d3-brane takes the role of the inflaton  @xcite . in general , it is possible to get inflation from a general class of non - standard kinetic terms , which is called k - inflation , in this model the inflation can exist even in the absence of the potential @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of more than one field can relax many limits on the single field models . in the multi - field models , co - operation between the fields",
    "can produce inflation , even if each field is not able to drive the inflation by itself , in such a way that the e - folding number and curvature perturbation are proportional to the number of fields .",
    "@xcite .",
    "regardless of the model of inflation , this era must end at some time @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a waterfall mechanism can cease inflation on a specific surface in field space which , is called the end of inflation surface . by using the equation of end of inflation surface , the e - folding number can be expressed explicitly in terms of fields ; this concept is known as multi - brid .",
    "we generalize this idea to the separable multi - field models , assuming a general equation for this surface in terms of fields at @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section([setup ] ) , we present set - up for separable models . in the second section ,",
    "we use @xmath2 formalism to arrive at observational parameter . in sections([sec dbi speed limit ] ) , we apply this method to the the multi - speed dbi in speed limit , and in section([constant sound speed ] ) , it is applied to dbi with constant sound speed .",
    "we consider a separable action for n number of scalar fields with the non - canonical kinetic term ; the action is given by s = d^4x [ m^2_p r+ 2_i^n p_i(x_i,_i ) ] , where @xmath3 is the kinetic term of @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "consider a spatially flat frw background , @xmath6 , the variation of action gives the field equations as follows , [ eqm1a ] ( a^3p_i , x_i_i)-a^3p_i,_i=0 .",
    "as the fluctuation of each field is characterized by its own sound speed,@xmath7 , this is a `` multi - speed '' model @xcite .",
    "we are interested in extending the multi - brid @xcite idea to the model described above , in which the inflation ends by a waterfall mechanism on a specific surface , by defining new fields that move radially in the field space.the equations of motion are solvable , which enables the evolution of new fields in terms of the number of e - folds . using @xmath8 formalism , the observational parameters such as spectral index and non - gaussianity are produced .    rewriting the equation of motion ( [ eqm1a ] ) as @xmath9 ,",
    "leads us to introduce new fields as follows : ( t ) , each @xmath10 is a functional of t , through @xmath11 given by the friedmann equations and @xmath4 . in terms of these new fields ,",
    "the equation of motion can be expressed very simply as , [ eqm1 ] = -h .",
    "the right hand side is identical for all the fields ; therefore , for each i and j we have , = .",
    "this indicates that in the space of @xmath10 the motion is radial ( see * fig.*[fig1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 - 1 ]    for later convenience , the time variable is changed to the number of e - folds , @xmath12 , @xmath13the minus sign shows that the number of e - folds is backward in time ( at the end of inflation , it vanishes i.e.@xmath14 ) . from ( [ eqm1 ] ) , in terms of @xmath15 , the equation of motion for @xmath4 becomes , [ eqm2 ] = 1 , which can be solved as [ number of e - fold ] n - n_f=- .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there is also another term contributing in n , @xmath16 .this is derived from the fact that the end of the inflation surface is not a constant energy density surface@xcite , if we assume that the universe is radiation dominated . immediately after the end of inflation",
    ", it is expressed by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the density , ",
    "f \" and  c \" refer to the end of the inflation surface and the surface of constant energy , respectively . throughout the rest of the paper this term",
    "is ignored .",
    "suppose the end of inflation surface is known , for example , a waterfall mechanism terminates the inflation on a specific surface .",
    "this surface is determined by a relation between the fields in q space at @xmath19 as @xmath20 . by using this relation and the radial motion in q space ,",
    "it is possible to arrive at the variation of the @xmath21s in terms of the variation in @xmath10s.throughout the rest of the paper we restrict ourselves to two fields which allow us to make some precise calculations . as the @xmath22s are not independent , at the end of the inflation there is only one degree of freedom in principle that can be characterized by only one parameter , which is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "therefore the @xmath21 are functions of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , variation of ( [ number of e - fold ] ) gives , [ variation1 ] n=-=- . rewriting this equation as [ variation2 ] -=- , the equation given above",
    "can be expanded as follows : [ variation21 ] _",

    "up to the second order , the variation of @xmath22 can be obtained from the varations of @xmath24 , [ variation3 ] = a_i(_1+_2)+a_ii , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the first and second derivatives of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath23 , equating the first - order and second - order terms of([variation21 ] ) , respectively which gives the @xmath30 and @xmath31 . substituting ( [ variation3 ] ) in ( [ variation21 ] ) gives , [ second orde q ] _",

    "this model includes a serious problem ; it is unable to produce enough inflation due to the steepness of the potential between the brane and anti - brane . to resolve this problem , a warp factor is considered to flatten the potential , which comes from the movement of brane and anti - brane inside a warped throat .",
