    "neutrino masses are one of the main motivations we have at present for physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "although a minimal extension of the sm by adding three right - handed neutrinos with dirac mass terms is still allowed by all neutrino data , this is not the preferred scenario for it does not explain the smallness of neutrino masses or why lepton number should exactly be conserved .",
    "scenarios in which the smallness of neutrino masses is linked to the non - conservation of lepton number are usually considered more natural .",
    "the simplest versions of these scenarios are realized at tree level and are known under the name of the seesaw mechanisms .",
    "seesaws of type i @xcite and iii @xcite extend the sm with new fermions , singlet and triplet respectively , with a majorana mass term , @xmath2 , which breaks explicitly lepton number . on the other hand ,",
    "seesaw of type ii @xcite adds only a scalar triplet with hypercharge  2 . in this case ,",
    "lepton number is broken explicitly in the scalar potential by a trilinear coupling , @xmath3 ( see also @xcite for a variation with lepton number broken spontaneously ) .",
    "seesaws of type i and iii give neutrino masses of order @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the yukawa coupling and @xmath6 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the sm doublet . then",
    ", if @xmath7 , masses can naturally be small .",
    "however , the same parameters that appear in the neutrino masses also appear in the mixing of new fermions with ordinary fermions , which is proportional to @xmath8 and must be very small .",
    "this makes these types of models very difficult to test .",
    "seesaw of type ii , however , generates neutrino masses of order @xmath9 , where now @xmath5 is the yukawa coupling of the scalar triplet to lepton doublets and @xmath2 the triplet mass .",
    "the trilinear coupling @xmath3 is protected by symmetry and can be naturally small .",
    "this allows for small neutrino masses compatible with a rich phenomenology ( the new scalars of the model could be produced at the lhc @xcite and there could be lepton flavor violating processes like @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xcite ) , raising the possibility to test the mechanism of neutrino masses in non - oscillation experiments .    in an effort to fixate the scalar spectrum of the model , in this article we revisit the scalar potential of the type ii seesaw model taking into account unitarity and the stability of the potential",
    "moreover , on the phenomenological side , we will also consider the constraints coming from the oblique @xmath1-parameter and higgs decay branching ratios , in particular @xmath12 , which are largely independent on the other sectors of the theory ( yukawa couplings and neutrino masses ) .",
    "in fact , the one - loop @xmath1-parameter only depends , to a good approximation , on the mass splitting between the scalars , while the new contributions to @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of the scalar masses and the mixing angle in the neutral scalar sector .",
    "a very important ingredient of our analysis is the requirement that the triplet scalar vev , @xmath13 , is much smaller than the electroweak scale .",
    "this is , in part , required by the tree - level @xmath14-parameter and in part , by the requirement of small neutrino masses .",
    "it has been noticed , in this case , that the some relations involving the scalar masses can be obtained and that the @xmath1-parameter constrains the splitting to be less that about @xmath15  gev ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we will re - derive these constraints by using perturbative unitarity and the @xmath1-parameter .",
    "after this , the spectrum of scalar masses is practically fixed up to a global scale and a small splitting between masses and can be expressed in terms of three parameters ( apart from the known parameters , the higgs mass and the electroweak scale , and the triplet vev which becomes irrelevant for @xmath16  gev ) .",
    "then , we will derive a lower bound on the global scale by adding present data on @xmath12 .",
    "similar analyses have been performed several times in the literature @xcite .",
    "but we differ from those in the sense that we express our results in terms of the experimentally measurable quantities . in the process",
    ", we have been able to unravel some features which , we believe , have not been emphasized before . additionally we also point out that the current measurement of the diphoton signal strength enables us to put lower limits on the nonstandard scalar masses , which are competitive or , in some cases , better than the direct search limits .    in section [ s :",

    "this limit is interesting in view of the fact that we can still have small neutrino masses through a small value for @xmath13 and at the same time be very close to the sm .",

    "however , for brevity , we do not display the explicit expressions here .",
    "interested readers can find the relevant formulas in some earlier papers@xcite .",
    "as has been noted in these references , since the sign of the @xmath131 vertex is opposite to that of the @xmath132 vertex , the singly charged scalar loop interfere destructively with the doubly charged one in the @xmath129 amplitude .",

    "i.e. _ , one is enhanced compared to the sm while the other is suppressed .",
    "but the new thing that we want to add to this context is the understanding of the behavior of @xmath127 and @xmath130 in the sm - like scenario .",
    "one should note that , as the charged scalars become heavy , the function @xmath133 in saturates to @xmath134 .",
    "hence the decoupling of the charged scalars from the loop induced higgs decays depends on how @xmath116  ( @xmath117 ) behaves with increasing @xmath78  ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we can easily check that , in the sm - like case defined by , the trilinear couplings in take the following forms :    [ glim ] @xmath135 \\approx -\\frac{2m_{++}^2}{v_d }   \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , in the final step we have used .",
    "thus it follows from that @xmath136 when @xmath137 .",
    "consequently the charged scalars contribute substantially to the diphoton or @xmath138-photon decay amplitudes even when their masses lie in the tev regime .",

    "the reason for this large quantum effect for heavy masses can be understood once we realize that both the vevs in this case are nonzero .",
    "this means the charged scalars obtain their masses entirely from spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , which leads to large quantum effects as also has been noted in the multi doublet context@xcite .",
    "but in the sm - like limit defined by one can obtain    [ glim2 ] @xmath141    here we can easily see that the charged scalars can be decoupled in the limit , @xmath142 let us investigate the above limit in some greater detail",

    "thus the condition  ( [ dec ] ) essentially implies that the charged scalars obtain all their masses from a non - ssb origin , which , not surprisingly , lead to decoupling in the same way as in the inert doublet models@xcite . from the combined region in fig .",
