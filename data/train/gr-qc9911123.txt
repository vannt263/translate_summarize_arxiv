    "imagine a stable hamiltonian system that is subjected to an external periodic perturbation as well as a frictional force that continuously takes energy out of the system .",
    "if the driving force vanishes on the average , then in general the average behavior of the system is characterized by damped motion . under favorable conditions ,",
    "however , the system could get captured into a prolonged resonance if the driving frequency is commensurate with an internal frequency of the system . in this paper , we study the dynamics of this phenomenon in the context of a simple model of certain relativistic binary systems that are of current interest .",
    "relativistic binary pulsars are generally expected to occur in some astrophysical environment and the gravitational effect of the surroundings on the binary orbit would be tidal in the first order of approximation . the evolution of the binary orbit under the combined influence of gravitational radiation reaction and the external tidal perturbation can lead to resonance under appropriate conditions [ 16 ] .",
    "once we average over the external periodic tidal perturbation , the binary pulsar is expected to lose energy to gravitational radiation damping so that the relative orbit would spiral inward unless there is resonance capture .",
    "this would come about if the external source deposits energy into the orbit over an extended period of time so as to compensate for the continuous loss of energy due to radiation reaction .",
    "this situation , which persists until the system leaves the resonance , can occur if the keplerian period of the osculating ellipse becomes commensurate with the period of the external perturbation . in this way",
    ", the binary pulsar can be captured into resonance with its gravitational environment .",
    "then , the standard data reduction schemes are expected to reveal that during resonance capture the semimajor axis of the binary is not monotonically decreasing due to the emission of gravitational radiation but is instead oscillating about a fixed resonance value since the external perturbation continuously deposits energy into the orbit during resonance so as to replenish on average the energy lost to gravitational waves .",
    "the system leaves the resonance when this delicate energy balance is significantly disrupted .",
    "such resonances are well known in the solar system , where the damping effects have a different origin ( see @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "one expects that over time the same kind of phenomenon will be observed in a sufficiently large sample of relativistic binary pulsars @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are transient chaotic phenomena that are generally associated with resonance . the transient chaos _",
    "per se _ may be difficult to detect observationally due to noise and other complications that exist in the data reduction process @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is numerical evidence for a peculiar chaotic effect , namely _ chaotic transition _ , that appears to be associated with transient chaos and involves a sudden transformation in the rate of orbital collapse @xcite .",
    "that is , the system makes a transition from one relative orbit to another that collapses much more rapidly .",
    "presumably such a chaotic transition  if it indeed occurs in nature  should be detectable by the timing observations of relativistic binary pulsars . though the unperturbed binary systems in our investigations always involve standard astronomical masses on keplerian orbits , it is possible to extend the analysis to geodesic orbits around black holes .",
    "such general relativistic systems involve stable kepler - like orbits as well as unstable orbits .",
    "we expect that our analysis of transient chaos could be extended to the stable orbits , while the occurrence of chaos involving the unstable orbits perturbed by incident gravitational radiation has been demonstrated by bombelli and calzetta @xcite",
    ". these results could be significant for the study of chaotic accretion onto black holes and possible chaotic enhancement in the emission of gravitational waves associated with active black holes .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show that resonance capture can indeed occur on average for a simplified model of the physical situation that has been described here , since our previous work on sustained resonance has been mainly numerical [ 2,4,5 ] .",
    "our mathematical model is briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "the second - order partially averaged system is given in section  [ sec : pave ] .",
    "the geometry of resonance capture for the second - order partially averaged system is presented in section  [ sec : gorc ] , and it is shown that resonance capture can indeed occur for this partially averaged model under certain conditions .",
    "the proof of a resonance capture mechanism for the full model equations remains an important unsolved problem ; instead , we provide numerical evidence for sustained resonance in our model in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "in a series of papers [ 16 ] , we have studied the long - term evolution of a keplerian binary system coupled to a gravitational environment .",
    "in fact , the influence of the environment has been replaced  for the sake of simplicity and definiteness  by the tidal perturbation of an external gravitational wave .",
    "more precisely , we have considered the _",
    "simplest _ gravitational model for a binary system under radiative perturbations . in the lowest ( quadrupole ) approximation , the external wave exchanges energy and angular momentum with the binary system but not linear momentum . for the purposes of the present investigation , we limit our considerations to a normally incident plane monochromatic external wave that is circularly polarized .",
    "the amplitude of this external perturbation is @xmath0 , @xmath1 ; it indicates the deviation of the spacetime metric from the minkowski metric as a consequence of the existence of the incident radiation field . in practice",
    ", @xmath0 could be extremely small ; in fact , direct laboratory detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources with @xmath2 is the goal of current experimental efforts .",
    "the relative motion of the binary is planar due to the transversality of the external wave and is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 determines the relative orbit , the indices @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . here",
    "the binary system consists of two point masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the center of mass of the system at rest at the origin of spatial coordinates , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the radiation reaction term is given to lowest order by @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe the relative motion in terms of polar coordinates in the orbital plane and an overdot indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath15 .",

    "the upper ( lower ) sign indicates right ( left ) circularly polarized radiation in the transverse - traceless gauge .",
    "a general comment is in order here regarding the physical realizability of such a perturbation .",
    "we can , for instance , imagine another binary system with a relative orbit that is _ circular _ with keplerian frequency @xmath20 .",
    "then , in the rest frame of this binary s center of mass and neglecting any dissipation the system emits gravitational radiation of frequency @xmath18 and the waves that propagate perpendicularly to the orbital plane of the circular binary system are circularly polarized ; far from the circular binary , these waves are nearly planar and of the form under consideration here .    in the absence of damping , we have shown that if @xmath0 is sufficiently small , the planar relative motion is bounded for all time as a consequence of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem  @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for this confinement is that the external wave does not monotonically deposit energy into the binary orbit ; in fact , the general situation is that energy flows back and forth between the wave and the binary so that on average no net transfer of energy takes place .",
    "when the orbital damping is taken into account , the general tendency of the binary system is to collapse ; however , under certain circumstances the system could get captured into resonance .",
    "the necessary condition for resonance is the commensurability of the keplerian frequency @xmath21 and the wave frequency @xmath18 ; that is , relatively prime integers @xmath22 and @xmath23 must exist for which @xmath24 . sustained resonance would actually come about if a delicate balance could be established between the radiative perturbations .",
    "it is useful to express the equations of motion in dimensionless form as in our previous work [ 35 ] . to this end ,",
    "we express all spatial intervals in units of @xmath25 and all temporal intervals in units of @xmath26 , where the scale parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are connected via @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , we assume that at some `` initial '' time the lengthscale @xmath27 is the semimajor axis of the binary orbit and @xmath30 is its period . in terms of polar",

    "the relationship between the chaos in the original dynamical system and possible chaotic effects in the averaged system near @xmath71 resonance is rather subtle and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here , we will consider instead the possibility of resonance capture . indeed",
    ", we will give a geometric description of resonance capture in system   and a rigorous proof that resonance capture does in fact occur .",

    "then , the set @xmath128 is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( consisting entirely of rest points ) for the unperturbed system  , i.e.    @xmath129    a rough description of this manifold is that nearby orbits are attracted or repelled from the vicinity of @xmath130 exponentially fast and the rates of expansion and contraction dominate the corresponding rates for orbits on @xmath130 . of course , in our case",

    "the manifold @xmath131 `` bounds '' a region in the phase space for system  , and this region corresponds to the initial conditions for orbits that are captured into resonance relative to system  .",
    "when the system is subjected to perturbation , @xmath131 is expected to `` split '' , for example , as depicted in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in fact , by a celebrated theorem of n. fenichel  @xcite , the normally hyperbolic manifold @xmath130 persists .",
    "if the perturbation parameter @xmath133 is sufficiently small , then the perturbed system has an `` invariant '' normally hyperbolic manifold @xmath134 that is again given as a graph over a region in @xmath124 ; in particular , the manifold @xmath134 has stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "under appropriate conditions that will be specified below , the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath134 , the manifolds resulting from the split homoclinic manifold @xmath131 , form a channel in the phase space where orbits of the phase flow enter the vicinity of the resonance ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this is the geometric description of resonance capture for a system such as  .",
    "let us note that because the unperturbed `` slow manifold '' @xmath130 consists entirely of rest points , it is an invariant set for the unperturbed flow .",
    "however , the perturbed manifold @xmath134 generally has no fixed points ; rather , the flow on @xmath134 is characterized by a slow drift in the @xmath119 variable .",
    "thus , @xmath134 is only invariant in the sense that orbits with initial conditions on this manifold stay on it until they exit at one of its boundary points . of course",
    ", as an effect of the slow drift , an orbit can , after a ( perhaps long ) sojourn near the resonance , enter a new dynamical regime .",
    "the sojourn time can be predicted from an analysis of the flow on the slow manifold .",
    "thus , our geometric picture gives a rather complete description of the phenomena associated with resonance capture .    to prove that the geometric description of resonance capture obtains for system",
    ", we must detect splitting of @xmath131 and determine the positions of the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath134 .",

    "moreover , the only way a captured solution can leave the vicinity of the resonance is to have its second component , @xmath119 , leave the region where @xmath149 , a process that occurs on a timescale of order @xmath150 .",

    "recall that system   is derived from the averaged physical model in part by a reversal of time .",
    "thus , it is convenient to have a result that implies `` release from resonance '' for system   so that it will imply capture into resonance for the original averaged model .",
    "of course , the phrase `` release from resonance '' means that the stable and unstable manifolds of the normally hyperbolic manifold @xmath130 split in the direction that is opposite to that required for capture ; in effect , orbits leave the vicinity of the resonance in a channel bounded by the unstable manifold .",

    "thus , there is a subinterval @xmath210 such that if @xmath229 , then the region @xmath230 , enclosed by the homoclinic orbit , contains only points whose first coordinates @xmath231 are in the interval @xmath232 . in particular , if @xmath229 , then @xmath233 and therefore @xmath234 .",

    ", we will verify conditions  1 and  2 . in order to determine the interval @xmath212 ,",
    "let us note that our ( unperturbed ) pendulum - type planar system has the form @xmath240 where @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 .",
    "system   is hamiltonian with total energy @xmath244 denote the coordinates of its hyperbolic saddle point by @xmath226 , and recall that @xmath245 .",
    "also , note that the homoclinic loop is given by the graphs of the functions @xmath246    [ p1 ] for system  , there is a point @xmath247 such that @xmath248 and @xmath249 the point @xmath250 is not a rest point .",
    "moreover , the equation @xmath251 has no solution for @xmath252 .",
    "that is , the homoclinic loop at @xmath253 crosses the @xmath254-axis at @xmath255 and encloses that portion of the @xmath254-axis given by @xmath256 .",
    "also , @xmath257 if and only if @xmath258 is such that @xmath259    define the function @xmath260 by @xmath261 and note that it has relative maxima at @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "also , @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "it follows that there is a point @xmath247 in the interval indicated in the statement of the proposition such that @xmath266 .",
    "moreover , this point is not a rest point .",
    "indeed , the only rest point in the open interval @xmath267 is the point @xmath268 , and it corresponds to a negative relative minimum of @xmath260 .",
    "if @xmath269 , and @xmath270 , then there must be some relative maximum of @xmath260 that is nonnegative .",
    "however , all the relative maxima that exceed @xmath222 have the form @xmath271 , where @xmath272 is a positive integer , and @xmath260 takes negative values at all such points ; therefore , we reach a contradiction . clearly , @xmath257 if and only if @xmath273 or @xmath274 recall that @xmath275 and @xmath276",
    "thus , with @xmath258 , inequality   is equivalent to the inequality    @xmath277 as required .    in summary ,",
    "let us recall that @xmath278 , where @xmath279 and @xmath280 by equation  .",
    "for incident left circularly polarized radiation , we have that @xmath281 and @xmath282 ; in fact , @xmath283 and for @xmath284 the first term in this taylor expansion is accurate to about 10% .",
    "then , all the hypotheses of proposition  [ rt ] are satisfied provided that there is some @xmath43 such that @xmath85 and @xmath285    one can show by inspection that condition ( iii ) is satisfied provided that @xmath286 , where @xmath287 . we therefore choose @xmath288 in agreement with condition ( i ) .",
    "moreover , one can directly verify that @xmath289 if we assume @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the eccentricities of the relativistic binary pulsars psr b1913 + 16 and psr b1534 + 12 are @xmath292 and @xmath293 , respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath294 , so that @xmath295 at the ( 2 : 1 ) resonance that we wish to consider .",
    "finally , @xmath60 is uniquely determined from @xmath296 once we recall that @xmath205 and @xmath297 ; hence , @xmath298 .",
    "we have shown that a set of parameters exists such that for incident left circularly polarized radiation the averaged equations permit sustained resonance .",
    "the essential requirement for sustained resonance in our approach is that the robinson integral be nonzero .",
    "our objective has been to _ prove _ sustained resonance in the second - order averaged equations for our model .",
    "however , we expect that robinson s integral is generally nonzero without the restrictive assumptions of proposition  [ rt ]",
    ". indeed , it should be clear from the proof of proposition  [ rt ] that @xmath171 can be negative without the requirement that each of the three integrals @xmath177 , @xmath299 , and @xmath184 be negative . for this reason , we expect that resonance capture would generally be possible for either circular polarization state of the incident radiation .",
    "moreover , circular polarization is not essential for sustained resonance as demonstrated by our previous numerical work on resonance capture that did not involve circular polarization [ 2,4,5 ] .",
    "indeed , the mathematical theory of sustained resonance developed in this paper owes much to the simplification ",
    "the reduction from four to three phase - space dimensions in the system  brought about by the assumption that the normally incident radiation has definite helicity .",
    "the proof of the existence of sustained resonance involves the second - order partially averaged system .",
    "we conjecture that the result can be extended to the original system .",
    "to provide evidence for this conjecture , it is interesting to use the set of parameters obtained in the previous section as part of the initial conditions needed to integrate the original system numerically . to this end , we integrate system   with initial conditions @xmath300 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 , and @xmath303 .",
    "thus the initial orbit has @xmath304 , @xmath290 , @xmath305 , and @xmath306 , so that @xmath307 as required .",
    "the periastron for this initial osculating orbit , which has true anomaly @xmath308 , occurs at @xmath309 ; hence @xmath310 .",
    "in fact , this initial orbit has been used frequently in our previous work [ 36 ] .",
    "we find that with these initial conditions the system is indeed in sustained ( 2 : 1 ) resonance for either circular polarization state as demonstrated in figures  4 and  5 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] can be produced as follows : system   is integrated backward from the initial point for normally incident radiation that is left circularly polarized until the system leaves the resonance and a final point of integration is stored ; then , the graph is made by integrating forward in time from this point .",
    "it is interesting to note that the binary orbit collapses rather rapidly following exit from resonance when the orbit is highly eccentric .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the rate of emission of gravitational radiation by the binary orbit is proportional to @xmath311 ; hence , as @xmath312 the loss of orbital energy to radiation leads to orbital collapse  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] can be produced in a similar way and illustrates the same situation for right circular polarization .",
    "the _ possibility _ of resonance in this case can be seen from the first - order averaged equations   ; that is , @xmath313 and hence @xmath314 , so that the situation depicted in figure  1 holds except that the direction of some arrows should be reversed .",
    "it is clear from figures  4 and  5 that evolutionary dynamics of the orbit while trapped in resonance depends sensitively upon the helicity of the incident radiation . for example",
    ", the orbit loses angular momentum while in resonance and becomes highly eccentric when the incident radiation has negative helicity as in figure  4 , while the opposite situation holds in figure  5 for positive helicity incident radiation ; this circumstance may be naturally interpreted in terms of the ( negative or positive ) angular momentum carried by the ( negative or positive helicity ) radiation and deposited into the binary orbit .",
    "the fact that the amplitude of oscillations around resonance is generally larger when the sense of the helicity of the radiation is the same as the rotation of the orbit is in agreement with our previous work on the hill system . in contrast to the hill system , the present case involves dissipation ; nevertheless , the analysis of the amplitude of oscillations around the resonance is very similar to that carried out in section  6 of  @xcite due to the fact that @xmath315 .",
    "figures 4 and 5 also illustrate the complex structure that is usually associated with a higher - order resonance  @xcite ; furthermore , the presence of chaos is strongly indicated in our numerical work .",
    "chaos is especially noteworthy in figure  5 ; therefore , the qualitative significance of our numerical results should be emphasized .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments with @xmath0 and @xmath33 twice as large as those in figures  4 and  5 . in this case , we find in the experiment corresponding to figure  5 that the @xmath316 resonance appears to have significant overlap with the @xmath317 resonance .",
    "let us note that we expect @xmath0 to be many orders of magnitude smaller in physical situations of interest ; however , we have taken @xmath0 to be @xmath318 in figures  4 and  5 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "do all relativistic binary orbits _ monotonically _ decay by gravitational radiation damping ?",
    "there is evidence for such energy loss from the timing analysis of only two pulsar systems @xcite .",
    "however , such a system could in principle fall into sustained resonance with an external source ; during resonance lock , the orbit would not decay on the average .",
    "the orbital decay would resume once the system is released from resonance .",
    "it remains to see  as more binary pulsars are discovered and their timing data accumulate  whether sustained resonance in fact occurs in relativistic binary systems .",
