    "recently , a phenomenological modification of the potential for @xmath34 has been suggested in terms of a cutoff @xmath35 in the core region , which successfully predicts for all principal quantum numbers @xmath36 and total angular momentum @xmath37 the fine splittings of the rydberg levels @xcite :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denotes the spin - orbit potential .",

    "[ section ii ] , we first check the accuracy of our recent quasiclassical calculations of the spectrum of the highly excited valence electron in @xmath13 @xcite with the potential ( [ modified potential ] ) , employing for the solution of the radial schrdinger eigenvalue problem a modern numerical collocation method based on the barycentric chebyshev interpolation @xcite .",
    "the results of these numerical calculations indeed agree very well with our recent quasiclassical calculations of the quantum defects for orbital angular momentum @xmath41 and also @xmath42 , but for @xmath2 we spot for the heavy - metal alkali atoms rubidium and cesium a discrepancy . in sec .",
    "[ section iii ]",
    "we then provide an explanation for this discrepancy bringing out for @xmath2 a hitherto unnoticed feature of the reputable potential of marinescu _",
    "et al_. ( [ marinescu et al . ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ section iv ] we show how to construct for the radial eigenfunctions of the rydberg states carrying an arbitrary orbital angular momentum @xmath43 two complementary uniform quasiclassical approximations .",
    "the first is the uniform wkb approximation of langer @xcite , where we determine the normalization constant by the procedure described by bender and orszag @xcite .",
    "the obtained analytical formula for the radial eigenfunctions of the rydberg states for @xmath1 in fact agrees remarkably well with the numerical calculations almost everywhere with exception of a small region around the origin at @xmath10 .",
    "close to the origin , however , the langer approximation becomes invalid .",
    "we thus patch in the region well below the remote turning point the quasiclassical approximation of langer with an ansatz for the radial wave function in terms of a bessel function first proposed by fock @xcite , that is asymptotically exact for @xmath44 , thus enabling us , for example for @xmath7 , to analytically determine at the origin @xmath10 the value of the radial wave function for the highly excited _ s_-states . in sec .",
    "[ section v ] , finally , we use these results to present a simple elementary proof for the semi - empirical fermi - segr formula @xcite determining the hyperfine splittings of the highly excited _ s_-states of the alkali atoms .",
    "to verify the accuracy of the quasiclassical calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite a numerically accurate method ( see supplementary material @xcite ) is required , that solves the radial schrdinger eigenvalue problem for the radial eigenfunctions @xmath45 with the modified potential ( [ modified potential ] ) reliably and accurately also for large principal quantum numbers @xmath0 @xcite :    @xmath46u_{n , j , l}(r)=0\\,.\\label{schroedinger eigenvalue problem}\\ ] ]    to achieve this goal we use here a spectral collocation method @xcite on a grid consisting of @xmath47 chebyshev grid points obtained by projecting equally spaced points on the unit circle down to the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "trivial scaling and shift leads then to the not - equally spaced point set @xmath49 which clusters near @xmath10 and near @xmath50 . in sharp contrast to a traditional finite difference method that controls the error of numerical discretization by the choice of grid spacing ,",
    "the accuracy of a _ spectral _ collocation method ( a well - known concept in modern numerical mathematics ) is only limited by the smoothness of the function being approximated @xcite .",
    "implementing now spectral chebyshev collocation the seeked wave function @xmath51 solving the radial schrdinger eigenvalue problem ( [ schroedinger eigenvalue problem ] ) is represented in terms of a finite vector @xmath52 of its values at the chebyshev grid points @xmath53 , thus defining implicitely a stable and accurate lagrange polynomial interpolant of degree @xmath54 .",
    "of particular value and simplicity is the numerically robust barycentric representation of this interpolant due to salzer @xcite :    @xmath55    where    @xmath56    as a matter of fact , @xmath57 is a polynomial of degree @xmath54 , coinciding with the function values @xmath52 at the grid points @xmath53 .",
    "well - known accuracy and stability concerns regarding convergence of high order polynomial interpolants do not apply to a chebyshev grid with its not - equispaced points clustering around the corner points of the grid @xcite .    replacing the function @xmath58 by such a polynomial interpolant @xmath57 of degree",
    "@xmath54 implies that derivative operations on those functions are replaced by the same operations applied to their interpolant .",
    "thus , the first derivative @xmath59 is now represented by a matrix @xmath60 of size @xmath61 acting on the vector of function values @xmath52 at @xmath47 grid points @xmath53 @xcite , likewise the second - order derivative @xmath62 is represented by a matrix @xmath63 .",
    "this approach converts the radial schrdinger eigenvalue problem ( [ schroedinger eigenvalue problem ] ) into a standard matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "a crucial point here is that in the calculations of the spectrum of the highly excited bound valence electron the grid should be fine enough to resolve the oscillations of the wave functions @xmath58 under consideration also in the coarsest part of the grid in accordance with the sampling theorem @xcite .",
    "moreover , the largest grid point @xmath64 should be located in the region well beyond the remote classical turning point @xmath65 , say , @xmath66 . in effect , one then requires dirichlet boundary conditions for the eigenfunction @xmath58 at both ends of the grid : @xmath67 these boundary conditions imply that the first and the last columns as well as the first and the last row of the matrix @xmath68 can be stripped off @xcite , thus leading to a @xmath69 matrix eigenvalue problem to be solved for the @xmath70 unknown function values @xmath71 at the inner points of the grid .",
    "it should be noted that only eigenvectors with associated eigenvalue @xmath72 need to be searched @xcite . moreover , because only eigenvectors with components @xmath71 becoming exponentially small for @xmath53 well beyond the remote classical turning point @xmath73 are meaningfull , all other solutions of the discrete matrix eigenvalue problem being physically meaningless .    for a detailed discussion and demonstration of the accuracy of the spectral collocation method on a chebyshev grid",
