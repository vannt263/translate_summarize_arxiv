    "achieving a complete unity of the fundamental forces together with an understanding of the origin of the three families and their hierarchical masses is among the major challenges still confronting particle physics .",
    "conventional grand unification falls short in this regard in that owing to the arbitrariness in the higgs sector , it does not unify the higgs exchange force , not to mention gravity .",
    "superstring theory is the only theory we know that seems capable of removing these shortcomings .",
    "it thus seems imperative that the low energy data extrapolated to high energies be compatible with string unification .",
    "it is , however , known @xcite that while the three gauge couplings , extrapolated in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) meet , at least aproximately [ 2 - 5 ] , provided @xmath6 is not too low ( see later ) , their scale of meeting , @xmath10 , is nearly 20 times smaller than the expected ( one  loop level ) string  unification scale @xcite of @xmath11 .",
    "it seems to us that there is still a second mismatch concerning the value of the unified gauge coupling @xmath5 at @xmath2 .",
    "subject to the assumption of the mssm spectrum , extrapolation of the low energy data yields a rather low value of @xmath12 [ 2 - 5 ] , for which perturbative physics should work well near @xmath2 . on the other hand , it is known @xcite that non  perturbative physics ought to be important for a string theory near the string scale , in order that it may help choose the true vacuum and fix the moduli and the dilaton vevs .",
    "the need to stabilize the dilaton in particular would suggest that the value of the unified coupling at @xmath13 in four dimensions should be considerably larger than @xmath14 @xcite . at the same time",
    ", @xmath15 should not be too large , because , if @xmath16 , the corresponding theory should be equivalent by string duality @xcite to a certain weakly coupled theory that would still suffer from the dilaton runaway problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 at @xmath13 should not probably be as large as even unity , or else , the one  loop string unification relations for the gauge couplings @xcite would cease to hold near @xmath13 ( e.g. in this case , the string threshold corrections are expected to be too large ) and the observed ( approximate ) meeting of the three couplings would have to be viewed as an accident . in balance , therefore , the preceding discussions suggest that an _ intermediate value _ of the string coupling @xmath17 at @xmath13 in four dimensions , which might be large enough to stabilize the dilaton , but not so large as to disturb significantly the coupling unification relations , is perhaps the more desired value .",
    "it is thus a challenge to find a suitable variant or alternative to mssm which removes the mismatch not only with regard to the meeting point @xmath2 , but also with regard to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "a third relevant issue is that the world average value of @xmath18 @xcite seems to be low compared to its value that is needed for mssm unification . barring possible corrections from gut threshold and planck scale effects , the latter is higher than about @xmath19 , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "it is conceivable that the resolution of _ all three issues _ raised above - i.e .",
    "( a ) understanding fermion mass  hierarchy , ( b ) removing incompatibility between mssm and string unification , and ( c ) accommodating low @xmath6- have a _",
    "common denominator_. the purpose of this note is to explore just this possibility , the common denominator in question being a previously suggested extension of the mssm spectrum @xcite that contains two vector  like families and their susy partners , having the quantum numbers of @xmath22 of @xmath4 , all with masses of order 1 tev .",
    "it has been noted for some time that the existence of two such families enables one to obtain a simple understanding of the observed inter - family mass - hierarchy of the three chiral families @xcite .",
    "the argument will be presented briefly in sec .",
    "3 . on the experimental front",
    "it is interesting to note that although the precision measurements of @xmath23 and of the oblique electroweak parameters ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) disfavor a fourth chiral family , they are rather insensitive to vector - like families @xcite .",
    "the existence of two vector  like families together with three chiral families and the associated form of the @xmath26 fermion mass matrix was in fact derived in the context of a susy preon model @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum could well emerge , however , even if quarks , leptons and higgs bosons are elementary , e.g. from a superstring theory . in view of its prospects for providing exciting discoveries at the lhc and nlc",
    ", we propose to explore here whether such a spectrum might have some additional advantages , _ in the context of an elementary quark  lepton ",
    "higgs theory _ , in bridging the gap between mssm and string unifications mentioned above , and simultaneously accommodating low @xmath7 . before proceeding ,",
    "we note a few alternative suggestions which have been proposed to address some of these issues .",
    "first , a very intriguing suggestion in this regard has recently been put forth by witten @xcite . using the equivalence of the strongly coupled heterotic @xmath27 and the @xmath28 superstring theories in @xmath29 , respectively to the weakly coupled @xmath29 type i and an @xmath30theory",
    ", he observed that the 4-dimensional gauge coupling and @xmath13 can both be small , as suggested by mssm extrapolation of the low energy data , without making the newton s constant unacceptably large .",
    "while this observation opens up a new perspective on string unification , its precise use to make @xmath31 at @xmath13 would seem to run into the dilaton runaway problem as in fact noted in ref .",
    "furthermore , lowering @xmath13 to @xmath32 would mean that the heavy string states , very likely including color triplets , would have masses @xmath33 .",
    "generically , this might lead to the problem of rapid proton decay through dimension 5 operators .",
    "the case of larger @xmath5 and @xmath2 proposed here ( see later ) would seem to fare better in overcoming these potential difficulties .",
    "a second way in which the mismatch between @xmath2 and @xmath13 could be resolved is if superstrings yield an intact grand unification symmetry like @xmath34 or @xmath4 with the right spectrum ",
    "i.e. , three chiral families and a suitable higgs system including an adjoint higgs at @xmath13 , and if this symmetry would break spontaneously at @xmath35 to the standard model symmetry . however , as yet , there is no realistic string  derived gut model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for such solutions , there is the likely problem of doublet - triplet splitting and rapid proton decay .",
    "a third alternative is based on string  derived standard model  like gauge groups and attributes the mismatch between @xmath2 and @xmath13 to the existence of new matter with intermediate scale masses ( @xmath36 gev ) , which may emerge from strings @xcite .",
    "such a resolution is in principle possible , but it would rely on the delicate balance between the shifts in the three couplings and on the existence of very heavy new matter which in practice can not be directly tested by experiments .",
    "also , within such alternatives , as well as those based on non  standard hypercharge normalization @xcite and/or large string ",
    "scale threshold effects @xcite , @xmath5 typically remains small ( @xmath37 ) , which is not compatible with the need for a larger @xmath5 , as suggested here .",
    "bearing in mind the discussions above , we study the running of the coupling constants within the variant spectrum of quarks and leptons proposed some time ago @xcite that assumes the standard model gauge symmetry but extends the mssm spectrum by adding to it two light vector - like families @xmath38 and @xmath39 , two higgs singlets ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and their susy partners , all at about 1 tev",
    ". we will refer to this variant as the extended supersymmetric standard model ( essm ) .",
    "the combined sets @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) transform as @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath4 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the allowed extensions of mssm in the low energy region are rather limited .",
    "barring addition of singlets , essm is in fact _ the only extension _ of the mssm , containing complete families of quarks and leptons , that is permitted by measurements of the oblique electroweak parameters and @xmath23 on the one hand , and renormalization group analysis on the other hand .",
    "the former restricts one to add only vector  like ( rather than chiral ) families @xcite , i.e. only @xmath46 of @xmath47 of @xmath4 , whereas the latter states that no more than one such pair can be added , or else the gauge couplings would grow too rapidly and would become nonperturbative far below the unification scale @xcite . while in this note",
    ", we do not address the derivation of such a spectrum in string theories , it is worth noting that the emergence of pairs of @xmath48 of @xmath49 or @xmath47 of @xmath4 in addition to chiral multiplets is rather generic in string theories @xcite .",
    "now if the three couplings meet ( at least approximately ) for mssm having 3 famiilies , i.e. three @xmath44 s , at a position @xmath2 , they are guaranteed to meet at the same position _ in the one - loop approximation _ for essm , having an extra pair of @xmath3 .",
    "but the extra pair having masses @xmath50 will inevitably raise the value of @xmath5 at the meeting point , as desired .",
    "however , they will not raise @xmath2 , in one loop .",
    "but once @xmath5 is raised to @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( see discussions later ) , two - loop effects are expected to be important especially near @xmath2 .",
    "our main task thus is to examine whether these two - loop effects for the essm spectrum , including contributions from gauge as well as yukawa interactions , would still retain the meeting of the three couplings while raising @xmath5 as well as @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that there have been past attempts @xcite to study the question of the meeting of the coupling constants by adding new families ( chiral or vector ) to the mssm spectrum .",
    "our approach and results will differ , however , from those of the past attempts because ( i ) we use a specific ( yet most economical ) pattern of the yukawa coupling matrix ( see below ) which is tied to our desire to understand the inter - family mass hierarchy [ 12,13 ] .",
    "( ii ) we include the contributions of these yukawa couplings on the running of the gauge couplings in two  loop , which turns out to be quite important , but which have been neglected in past attempts .",
    "( iii ) we use smoothed out threshold effects near the tev scale [ 3 - 5 ] .",
    "( iv ) and finally , owing to the beneficial effects of the yukawa couplings ( see later ) , we stay within semi  perturbative limits with @xmath53 , in contrast to @xmath54 in ref .",
    "@xcite so that our results using the two loop @xmath55-functions are expected to be more reliable .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is known that the inter  family mass  hierarchy is reproduced simply if the three chiral familiies @xmath56 , @xmath57 derive their masses primarily through their off  diagonal mixings with the two vector  like families @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "short of deriving such a mass  matrix from a string theory , we will assume suitable discrete symmetries ( see later ) which ensure this feature . to a good approximation the corresponding @xmath26 yukawa coupling matrix , near the presumed unification scale , is thus assumed to have the simple form : @xmath60    here the symbol @xmath61 and @xmath62 stand for quarks as well as leptons , and @xmath63 .",
    "the subscript @xmath64 denotes @xmath65 or @xmath66 , while @xmath67 or @xmath68 denotes quark or lepton color .",
    "@xmath69 with @xmath70 denotes the familiar two higgs doublets , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are higgs singlet fields . if the yukawa couplings satisty left ",
    "right , up  down as well as quark ",
    "lepton symmetries at the string scale , we would have @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and these couplings would be independent of flavor and color indices @xmath64 and @xmath73 at that scale . the zeros appearing in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are expected to be corrected by terms of order 1 mev through vevs inserted into higher dimensional operators .",
    "the higgs fields @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath69 are assumed to acquire vevs so that @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . to see the reason for family mass hierarchy , though",
    "not essential assume for simplicity @xmath77 and @xmath78 for a moment and denote @xmath79 and @xmath80 . regardless of the values of these yukawa couplings , one can always rotate the basis vectors so that @xmath81 is transformed to the form @xmath82 , @xmath83 simultaneously to the form @xmath84 , and similarly @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "_ it is thus apparent why one family is massless ( barring corrections of order 1 mev ) , despite lack of any hierarchy in the yukawa couplings @xmath87 and @xmath88 _ ; this one is naturally identified with the electron family . at the unification scale one obtains @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "a value of @xmath91 , which is in the realm of naturalness , thus provides a big hierarchy of about @xmath92 between the masses of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the string scale .",
    "thus the presence of two vector  like families helps to provide a simple explanation of the inter ",

    "an interesting comment is in order regarding the value of @xmath160 .",
    "naively , without the assistance of the yukawa couplings , owing to the large ratio @xmath161 , @xmath162 would be much too big compared to experiments at the low scale , if it were equal to @xmath163 at @xmath2 .",

    "( 6)-(8 ) , which we use in turn to extrapolate to higher values of @xmath182 with the help of eqs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 , the three gauge couplings meet at a scale @xmath183 ( to within 2% difference from each other ) , with a unified value of the gauge couplings @xmath184 .",
    "@xmath185 : for this case @xcite , the couplings meet almost perfectly at @xmath186 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    @xmath189 . here",
    "we get perfect meeting with @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( see fig .",
    "while we have not explored the parameter space pertaining to the spectrum of the new particles and variation in @xmath6 in any detail , we find it indeed @xmath192 that the three couplings meet , even perfectly for many cases , for a fairly wide variation in the essm spectrum beyond what we have exhibited here [ 30 ] .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath193 and @xmath194 in essm are found to lie in the ranges of [ 31 ] : @xmath195 thus we see that essm leads to coupling  unification , with an intermediate value of @xmath5 , and a lower value of @xmath6 than that needed for mssm unification , just as desired .",
    "the resulting @xmath196 is higher than the mssm value , but it is still lower than the one  loop string  unification scale of ref .",
    "@xcite , which , for @xmath187 , yields @xmath197 .",
    "this remaining gap between @xmath2 and @xmath13 may have its resolution in part due to the increased importance of two  loop string threshold effects , corresponding to an intermediate value of @xmath5 , which could lead to significant corrections to the one  loop formula for @xmath13 [ 6 ] , and in part due to the relative imporance of three and higher loop effects , which may shift @xmath2 ( see remarks below ) .",
    "in other words , considering the proximity of @xmath196 to the expected string scale of @xmath198 , contributions from the infinite tower of heavy string - states , which have been neglected in the running of @xmath153 s , and quantum gravity may play an important role in bridging the relatively small gap between @xmath2 and @xmath13 [ 32 ] . in summary ,",
    "essm predicts ( a ) an intermediate value of @xmath5 which may help stabilize the dilaton , ( b ) a value of @xmath199 , would fare better than the case of @xmath200 [ 17 ] in avoiding the potential problem of rapid proton decay induced through d = 5 operators and ( d ) a lower @xmath6 than the case of mssm .",
    "these appear to be distinct advantages of essm over mssm .    before concluding , the following points are worth noting .",
    "( i ) even if essm ",
    "unification might be closer to the truth , it provides a simple reason why the couplings appear to meet , at least approximately , even for mssm . as alluded to before",
    ", the reason is that in one loop , unification of couplings in one scheme implies that for the other , though with a vastly different @xmath5 .",
    "the two models differ only in two loop and thereby in the resulting values of @xmath2 , @xmath5 as well as @xmath6 .",
    "( ii ) the two loop gauge coupling contribution ( i.e. , @xmath98 terms in eq . ( 2 ) ) which raise the slopes of @xmath153 , together with the softening effects of the yukawa contributions which do the opposite , turned out to play an important role [ 33 ] in achieving unification for essm .",
    "it is the interplay of these two contributions which leads to a good meeting of the three gauge couplings ( fig . 1 - 3 ) with a low @xmath6 .",
    "( iii ) although 3loop effects could be important especially in fixing @xmath2 , we expect our calculation based on 2loop contributions presented here to be still fairly reliable , at least for the range @xmath201 for which the couplings are small ( i.e. , @xmath202 , see fig",
    ". 1 - 3 ) . by the time @xmath182 rises to @xmath203 ,",
    "the three couplings , especially @xmath204 and @xmath205 , begin turning sharply upward together in a manner that the tendency of the three curves to converge to a common meeting point is already apparent ( see fig .",
    "owing to the coupled rge for the three @xmath153 , we suspect that this tendency would persist in three and higher loops [ 32 ] .",
    "( iv ) a related remark : if @xmath5 has an intermediate value , so that it may help stabilize the dilaton , the relative importance of two and possibly higher loops near @xmath2 , compared to the case of mssm , can not be avoided .",
    "yet as shown here , unification can already be seen quite visibly in two loops in the sense commented above .",
    "( v ) this preliminary work of essm motivates further study of the evolution of the gauge couplings , fermion and scalar masses as well as of radiative symmetry breaking in essm with the inclusion of two  loop evolution of yukawa couplings and three  loop effects in eq .",
    "( vi ) last but not least , essm predicts [ 12 - 16 ] two complete vector  like families with leptonic and quark members having masses in the ranges of ( 200 gev1 tev ) and ( 500 gev 2.5 tev ) respectively . their mass  pattern , mixing and decay modes as well as characteristic signals have been considered in detail in ref . [ 14 ] . to mention just a few such signals , pair production of vector  like quarks at lhc and/or future version of ssc would lead to systems such as @xmath206 ) and @xmath207 , while an @xmath208 collider ( nlc ) could produce @xmath209 and even flavor  violating @xmath210 pair appreciably , followed by the decay @xmath211 . furthermore ,",
    "once the relevant momentum transfer for sub - processes exceeds about @xmath212 in hadronic colliders , the corresponding @xmath7 would grow significantly due to contributions from virtual ( or real ) heavy quark pairs and their susy partners .",
    "this would manifest for example in enhancement of jet cross sections , even below threshold for production of real heavy quarks of a nature recently reported by the cdf group [ 34 ] . even though the cdf findings may or may not reflect truly new physics , the phenomenon should reappear in high @xmath213processes of future colliders including the lhc if the vector  like quarks with masses as above exist .    to conclude , essm , possessing two extra vector  like families with masses of order 1 tev [ 35 ] , provides ( a ) a simple explanation of the inter ",
    "family mass  hierarchy [ 12,13 ] as well as ( b ) unification with a higher @xmath214 , a higher @xmath196 and a lower @xmath6 compared to mssm [ 31 ] , just as desired .",
    "the emergence of an extra pair of @xmath215 is rather generic in string theories .",
    "but the derivation of the essm spectrum together with a standard model  like gauge symmetry and yukawa coupling matrix , as assumed here , from a string theory remains an important task .",
    "owing to the advantages mentioned above , essm appears to be an attractive , yet falsifiable , alternative to mssm .",
