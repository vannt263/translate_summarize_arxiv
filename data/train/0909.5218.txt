    "the so - called isolated neutron stars ( ins ; see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) are a group of seven ( confirmed ) nearby ( @xmath6kpc ) neutron stars with low ( @xmath7 ) x - ray luminosities and long ( 311s ) spin periods .",
    "they stand out from the normal neutron star population because of their timing properties ( which should not have influenced their method of discovery via soft x - ray emission , although see @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are consistent with cooling neutron stars of ages @xmath8myr @xcite , in rough agreement with their kinematic ages ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a crucial unknown in understanding the ins",
    "is their magnetic field strengths .",
    "this is important in understanding the x - ray spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and their thermal history @xcite . the x - ray spectra of the ins appear thermal , with temperatures of @xmath9k and with , in all but one source , broad absorption features at energies of 0.2 to 0.75kev .",
    "these features may give clues to the chemical composition and structure of the ins surfaces , but also depend strongly on the magnetic field .",
    "for a hydrogen atmosphere the simplest possibilities are electron and proton cyclotron resonances or transitions between bound states of neutral hydrogen , all of which depend on the field strength . even with different compositions ( or states )",
    "the field strength is still relevant . at the same time",
    ", the magnetic field can affect the cooling rate and thermal content of the neutron star atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "dipolar magnetic field strengths can be estimated from coherent timing solutions , and we used x - ray observations to derive such solutions for four ins , finding magnetic fields of @xmath10 g ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we constrain the spin - down rate and hence magnetic field strength of the ins  ( hereafter rx  j0806 ) with a series of dedicated _ xmm_-_newton _  observations .",
    "we also present a preliminary spectral analysis , but defer a detailed phase - resolved analysis to a later paper .",
    "rx  j0806  was identified as a possible neutron star by @xcite on the basis of a soft thermal spectrum and the absence of an optical counterpart . using _",
    "xmm _ , @xcite confirmed that the spectrum was soft and blackbody - like and identified a candidate @xmath11s periodicity .",
    "further observations confirmed this periodicity and also suggested that the x - ray spectrum was not purely a blackbody , but had a broad absorption feature at @xmath12kev ( @xcite ; hereafter ) . in",
    "what follows , we assume a distance of 250pc to rx  j0806 , derived by @xcite from a comparison of the x - ray absorption column density with a model for the interstellar medium ( using @xmath13 , consistent with what we infer ) .    with rx  j0806 , we now have spin - down measurements or constraints for five of the seven confirmed ins . examining the global properties of the ins relative to other related neutron star populations , we attempt to understand how the ins fit with the other groups .    the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we present our new data and perform our timing (   [ sec : timing ] ) and spectroscopic (   [ sec : spectra ] ) analyses .",

    "[ sec : insspectra ] , we compare the timing and spectral properties of rx  j0806  to the rest of the ins and try to understand the origin of the x - ray absorption features . in ",
    "[ sec : pop ] , we extend the comparison to the pulsar population as a whole , exploring the qualitative relation between the ins and relevant sub - populations of pulsars . from this , we are led to consider the role that magnetic field decay may play in the evolution of the ins , and in   [",

    "we used the same source and background extraction regions as for the timing analysis , created appropriate response files , and binned the spectral files such that the bin width was at least 25ev ( about one third of the spectral resolution ) and the number of source plus background counts was at least  25 .",
    "we first compared the raw epic - pn spectra of all of the observations against each other .",
    "this did not include any response files or calibration corrections , but even so the binned pn spectra were generally consistent with each other implying no spectral change ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnraw ] ) .",
    "the only small deviations were seen for the archival data in 2000 and 2003 ( reduced @xmath43 of 23 ) , and much of that could be corrected by a small slope across the 0.151.2kev band : a fractional change of @xmath78 is sufficient to get a reduced @xmath43 of 12 for all observations .",
    "this change for the early data most likely reflects a small degree of event pileup present in those observations above 0.7kev , caused by the 73ms frame time of the full frame mode being insufficient to separate all events ( for the small window mode , with its 6ms frame time , pileup is not an issue ) . because of this corruption , in the following fits we excluded the full frame data .",
    "we note , however , that the results including those data were still quite similar .",
    "we fit the pn data from 20082009 together using ` sherpa ` .",
    "like , we found that an absorbed blackbody did not provide a good fit .",
    "indeed , the deviations from a blackbody forced the interstellar absorption column density @xmath79  to zero . rather than setting @xmath79arbitrarily ,",
    "we fit for an unabsorbed blackbody : while not realistic , this provides a reference .",
    "we list the corresponding radius and temperature in table  [ tab : spec ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnbb ] , one sees that there are strong negative residuals near @xmath80kev .",
    "we tried fitting for this using gaussian absorption lines , defined as follows , @xmath81 \\label{eqn : gauss}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the continuum spectrum ( a blackbody with interstellar absorption ) , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and fwhm@xmath85 are the central energy , absorption depth , and fwhm of absorption component @xmath23 and the factor of @xmath86 converts from a fwhm to a gaussian @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnbb ] , one sees that the absorption is broad and somewhat asymmetric .",
    "we found that , as a result , if we left the fwhm free , a single gaussian became as wide as the blackbody peak .",
    "instead , therefore , we decided to fix the fwhm to 0.2kev , similar to what was used by ( 0.16kev ) .",
    "this is arbitrary , but should at least give a qualitative sense of the amount of absorption present . including this single component results in a feature with an equivalent width of 53ev and a significantly improved fit . as a consistency check",
    ", we kept the central energy and amplitude of the absorption fixed and fit for the fwhm , finding a best - fit value of 0.23kev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pnbb ] , there still appear to be significant deviations of the residuals of the 1 g model near @xmath87kev , showing that our single line could not reproduce the deviations from the black body well .",
    "we therefore added a second gaussian absorption component near that energy .",
    "this significantly improved the fit , with much flatter residuals and a reduced @xmath43 of 1.04 .",
    "the change in @xmath43 is significant at the @xmath88 level , according to an f - test .",
    "we also fit gaussians at a range of energies across the 0.21.1kev band , and find that except for the edges of the band ( where the fitting breaks down ) only lines near @xmath89kev give significant improvements to the fit .",
    "compared to allowing the fwhm of the first gaussian to vary , we find that including a second line gives a much better fit ( e.g. , reduced @xmath43 of 1.52 for fwhm@xmath90kev ) .",
    "even with two gaussians , there is still structure in the residuals and the reduced @xmath43 is not quite 1 , likely reflecting the even - more complex shape of the absorption feature .",
    "the two lines in figure  [ fig : pnbb ] overlap , and there are residuals at their edges .",
    "the equivalent width of the first line has now increased to 89ev , with the second at 55ev .",
    "the energies of these lines are in an almost 3:2 ratio which may reflect some underlying harmonic structure to the absorption , but it may also just come from attempts to fit the complex structure of the absorption with simple shapes : changing the fwhm of each line changes the central energies and the ratio , which is almost 1.7 for lines with fwhm of 0.3kev .",
    "we could add additional components to improve the fit but they become increasingly artificial . we did try to fit in wavelength space where the shape of the absorption is slightly different ( e.g. , @xcite ) . there",
    "the basic results hold , and while a single gaussian does a somewhat better job , it is still far from perfect .",
    "overall the absorption seems truly complex in shape , with a total equivalent width @xmath91ev .",
    "further phase - resolved fits may be able to help understand some of the complexities , but we defer them to a later paper .",
    "while the data were largely consistent with a constant spectrum , we did one simple test in which we allowed the individual observations to differ . with the basic 2 g fit from table  [ tab : spec ]",
    "the observations had reduced @xmath43 ranging from 0.7 to 3.3 , where the longest observation ( rev .",
    "618 ) had the worst @xmath43 .",
    "this is also evident in figure  [ fig : pnbb ] , where the residuals from rev .",
    "618 are generally similar to the average residuals , with some slight deviations at high energies . with the exceptions of the data from 2000 and 2003 , we find the data are consistent with a constant spectrum .",
    "the early data deviate slightly , giving slightly higher temperature and lower radius , but again this is largely because of the pileup - induced apparent hardening of the spectrum . even including all of the data in the fit , @xmath92 changes by only a few ev with a resulting change in the blackbody radius such that @xmath93 , i.e. , the flux stayed relatively constant ( @xmath94% ) .",
    "much like the other ins for which we have derived timing solutions / constraints , rx  j0806  has a magnetic field near a few by @xmath95 g ( nominally , @xmath96 g and @xmath2 g at 2@xmath3 ) with a characteristic age of a few myr ( nominally , @xmath97myr and @xmath98myr at @xmath99 ) and a spin - down luminosity of @xmath100 . as such ,",
    "the ins form a very homogeneous group . here",
    ", we discuss the implications for their spectral features , as well as for the overall neutron star population .      in @xcite we compared the x - ray absorption of the different ins to a simple model including ion cyclotron and neutral hydrogen absorption in strong magnetic fields .",
    "we noted that the absorption energy of rx  j0806  ( @xmath12kev ) was similar to that of rx  j1605.3 + 3249(@xcite ) , and we see here that the depths are also comparable ( we found 139ev for the equivalent width of the main absorption line for rx  j1605.3 + 3249 ) .",
    "@xcite even found that a second line with an energy 1.5 times the first significantly improved the fit of rx  j1605.3 + 3249 , as we found here for rx  j0806 , making the sources even more similar , although we again caution that it is not clear how unique or meaningful those fits are .",
    "we speculated that the magnetic fields might be the same , at @xmath4 g ( this value is required for both proton cyclotron and neutral hydrogen transitions ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "however , even though we do not have a clear detection of spin - down and thus can not compare in detail , we can exclude this picture for rx  j0806 : our limits show that at least the dipole component is quite a bit lower ( see for a similar discussion regarding rx  j2143.0 + 0654 ) .",
    "the possible presence of multiple lines complicates the situation somewhat , since the `` fundamental '' may be at lower energies and thus the inferred magnetic field weaker .",
    "however , since harmonics should be significantly weaker for ion cyclotron resonance at least @xcite , this seems unlikely to be the explanation .    presuming that the absorption comes from some transition in the atmosphere , there are a number of alternative explanations .",
    "for one , the magnetic field geometry could play a role .",
    "the dipole component that we measure is only a projection of the true dipole field , and the field on the surface could have higher order or substantial toroidal components @xcite . beyond that",
    ", different ins could have different chemical composition , although then we have to understand how the apparent emission radii of the ins are relatively similar @xcite .    including rx  j0806  in the magnetic field - effective temperature plane ,",
    "it is consistent with the line defined by rx  j1856.5@xmath03754 rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 , and rx  j1308.6 + 2127 .",
    "as discussed in , this correlation , while quite possibly a coincidence , may have some relation to the origin of the ins and the coupling of the magnetic and thermal evolutions ( see below ) .",
    "it is also possible that it is influenced by surface condensation @xcite .      while the ins were discovered over 10 years ago , we still lack a detailed appreciation for their place in the overall neutron star population and for what makes them unique ( although see @xcite and references therein for some discussion ) .",
    "a full understanding requires detailed models of the birth and evolution of neutron stars , but given the small numbers of objects and the large number of free parameters , getting reliable constraints is necessarily difficult .",
    "however , we can gain some insight by comparing the ins to different related neutron star populations . for this purpose ,",
    "we give the salient properties of different objects in table  [ tab : all ] . aside from the seven confirmed ins , we consider :    * rotation - powered pulsars detected in the _ rosat",
    "_ all - sky survey with count - rates @xmath101 in the pspc ( referred to here as `` rasspsrs '' ) .",

    "rotation - powered pulsars with dipole magnetic field @xmath102 g",
    "( so called high-@xmath103 pulsars , or `` hbpsrs '' ) , but limited to those with x - ray observations .",
    "these objects each make appropriate comparisons with the ins .",
    "the rasspsrs are generally young and nearby neutron stars ( we exclude the crab pulsar from further consideration as it is much younger and more distant than the rest of the rasspsrs ) , with x - ray luminosities and distances similar to those of the ins .",
    "moreover , these were all detected in the same survey that discovered the ins .",
    "however , we do not know exactly how young the ins are .",
    "we therefore also include the nearpsrs : a sample of moderately young , moderately nearby pulsars regardless of their x - ray luminosity .",
    "while the ins are likely within 500 or 700pc , we extend our range to 1kpc for the pulsars since the distances of both classes are uncertain .",
    "similarly , we extend to characteristic ages of 5myr , compared to characteristic ages of @xmath104myr for the ins and kinematic ages of @xmath105myr . finally , as the ins have larger than average magnetic fields , we also include those hbpsrs that have comparable dipole fields ( @xmath102 g ) and x - ray observations .    for each object ,",
    "we give :    * the timing properties , comprising the spin - period and the properties derived from that and @xmath56 : dipole magnetic field , characteristic age , and spin - down luminosity . with the exception of rx  j2143.0 + 0654  and rx  j0806  ( where the spin - down measurements are only marginally significant ) these data are uniformly of high quality .",
    "* the x - ray spectral properties , comprising the count - rate ( as detected in the _ rosat _ pspc ) , temperature and radius of the best - fit blackbody , luminosity of the blackbody , and total luminosity including any non - thermal components .",
    "the quality of these parameters varies by object . for the ins they are relatively uniform , but the details of the spectral fit depend on the observations and the object as different objects",

    "[ sec : spectra ] and [ sec : insspectra ] ) . for the rasspsrs",
    "the thermal components are from just one possible decomposition , and often two blackbodies are required in addition to a non - thermal component . for the fainter nearpsrs and hbpsrs",

    "distances from astrometry are ideal , but in marginally - significant cases ( such as rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ; @xcite ) lutz - kelker bias @xcite can make them appear closer than they are , although other information such as x - ray absorption and galactic geometry can be incorporated to improve the situation . for objects without astrometry ,",
    "we rely on the dispersion measure ( in radio ) and hydrogen column densities ( in x - rays ) along with models for the galaxy . in both cases ,",
    "the results can be unreliable , especially for close objects ( as these are ) , although it is less likely that they are systematically biased .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray absorption column density can be unreliable as it is often covariant with other fitting parameters as well as with the assumed shape of the spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    for additional notes on the data , see table  [ tab : all ] .    if we take the rasspsrs and ins as a single sample detected by _",
    "rosat _ , the two groups have roughly comparable sizes @xcite .",
    "based on their temperatures and independent ages at least some of the rasspsrs may be slightly younger than the ins , but the temperatures can be affected by non - thermal emission processes absent in the ins . comparing the ins to the rasspsrs , the ins have comparable x - ray luminosities of @xmath106 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematic ages of the ins ( when available ) are comparable to if not slightly larger than the ages of the rasspsrs . however , the characteristic ages of the rasspsrs are also small , @xmath105myr , while the characteristic ages of the ins are all @xmath107myr .",
    "all of the rasspsrs have periods @xmath108s , while the ins have periods an order of magnitude longer and considerably stronger magnetic fields .",
    "in contrast , for the slightly older nearpsrs the characteristic ages are often comparable to those of the ins but the x - ray luminosities are several orders of magnitude lower ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the ins also have much lower @xmath62 than any other population .",
    "finally , we note that ins have larger radii and smaller effective temperatures for the same x - ray luminosity .",
    "is this an innate difference , perhaps as a result of the magnetic field geometry ? or is it artificial , perhaps a consequence of unrealistic emission models ?    as we discussed previously , we need to reconcile the discrepant kinematic and characteristic ages of the ins . for one or two objects it could be a coincidence , but even for the objects without kinematic ages ( rx  j0806 , rx  j2143.0 + 0654 )",
    ", the luminosities suggest the true ages are substantially shorter than the characteristic ages . while having a very long initial period is possible , it would have to be very close to the current value . for other sources where the characteristic ages exceed the true ages , like psr  j0538 + 2817 @xcite , the initial spin period required in order to have spun - down to their current periods in their true ages ( assuming dipole braking ) is @xmath110 .",
    "this is longer than the traditionally - assumed @xmath111ms ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but similar to the more recently favored periods of a few hundred ms ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and , most relevant for the present purposes , much smaller than what would be required for the ins ( @xmath112s ) .",
    "@xcite have discovered a pulsar whose spin - down torque varies quasi - periodically along with its radio emission . for approximately 1020% of the time psr  b1931 + 24 ( an otherwise ordinary pulsar with characteristic age of 1.6myr and dipole field of @xmath113 g ) is visible as a radio pulsar , but for the remaining time the radio emission is not detectable and the torque is reduced to @xmath114 of its normal value .",
    "the difference is attributed to the presence ( or strength ) of an energetic plasma wind , where a strong wind leads to radio emission and higher torque . while we suspect from its h@xmath115 nebula that rx  j1856.5@xmath03754",
    "does indeed have an energetic wind and brakes by magnetic dipole radiation , that scenario is not completely self - consistent ( see below ) .",
    "so the absence of radio emission from the ins may point to cessation ( or at least diminution ) of a wind and its associated torque , and this could be a recent development in the histories of the sources if radio emission has just shut off . if the wind / radio emission only stopped recently ( the worst case scenario )",
    "then the period evolution would have been dominated by a spin - down approximately @xmath116 times what we see now and the characteristic age that we measure now would be high by 50% .",
    "this would go some but not all of the way toward resolving the discrepancy between the timing and kinematic ages , although differences in geometry ( also see ) could lead to slightly larger factors ( other intermittent pulsars have since been discovered with slightly larger ratios of 1.7 instead of 1.5 , possibly due to differences in alignment between the rotation and magnetic axes ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a comparison also suggests that there could be torque and/or radio flux variations in the ins , neither of which has been seen ( except for the one timing / spectral change for rx  j0720.4@xmath03125 ; @xcite ) but the sampling has been very sparse .",
    "another possibility is that spin - down does not follow the expectations for magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "for instance , a decaying magnetic field would give rise to a situation like what we see for the ins , as it would allow the sources to spin down rapidly early in their evolution .",
    "field decay was proposed previously for the ins as a way to keep them hotter longer and thereby make them overrepresented in a local sample @xcite .",
    "initial timing results suggested that field decay was not presently heating the ins @xcite , and indeed the ins have roughly the expected thermal luminosities for their kinematic ages ( especially given the large uncertainties and the steep decline in thermal luminosity for objects of this age ; see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as we discuss below , field decay may have profoundly affected the magnetic and rotational evolution of the ins , and may have some other visible consequences .",
    "the models of field decay used by @xcite were rudimentary , and including decay by other modes as well as a strong toroidal component can greatly change the outcome .",
    "regardless of the specific model , if the characteristic ages are correct for the ins , they are too luminous by more than a factor of @xmath117 to be powered by residual heat .",
    "they would therefore require an extra energy source which we know can not be the spin - down luminosity : the remaining alternative is magnetic field decay .",
    "if instead ( and as we believe ) the kinematic ages are correct , then the x - ray luminosities are reasonable , but we need to explain the long periods ( and the associated large characteristic ages , low spin - down luminosities ) . again , magnetic field decay seems to be the best option .",
    "the coupled magnetic and thermal evolution for neutron stars was studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "these authors assumed a range of initial field and temperature configurations and then followed them over time .",
    "briefly , they found that for all sources with initial magnetic fields @xmath118 g , the final magnetic field is @xmath119 g at 0.5myr .",
    "but for all sources with weaker initial magnetic field the final magnetic field is just half the initial field .",
    "we note that the model of @xcite assumes magnetic field configurations and mechanisms of decay that may well be overly simplified .",
    "one of the biggest free parameters in their models is the ratio of toroidal to poloidal fields .",
    "this can vary significantly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the non - linearity of field decay means that a strong , decaying toroidal component can alter the weaker poloidal component while being otherwise invisible .    despite the above uncertainties , it seems encouraging that the main findings of @xcite for the results of field decay are similar to what we infer for the ins : neutron stars grouped around @xmath120 g at true ages of @xmath121myr or older . taking the magnetic field evolution and using it to infer the spin - down history ,",
    "one expects that neutron stars with strong fields quickly move across the @xmath122 diagram , losing memory of the initial spin period .",
    "we find that as long as the initial field is between @xmath123 g and @xmath124 g , then the neutron star ends up at a period of 3 to 15s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "coupling the thermal evolution in with the magnetic field , @xcite find luminosities of @xmath106 at ages of @xmath121myr , similar to what is expected for less strongly magnetized neutron stars ; the excess energy from the field decay is mostly radiated at earlier ages , with the thermal luminosity being substantially higher around @xmath125yr . at @xmath121myr ,",
    "the difference may still be a factor of a few ( dependent on field configuration and strength ) , but this would be largely lost in the observational uncertainties ( age , distance , etc . ) .",
    "this small remaining difference should not lead to a great over - representation in a local sample , and therefore the fact that about half of the young neutron stars detected by _ rosat _  ( the ins plus the rasspsrs ) have long periods ( and presumably strong fields ) should give a reasonable clue to the true population . in a bit more detail , this will depend on the slope of the cooling curve : for power - law cooling @xmath126 , increasing the luminosity by a factor of @xmath127 will lead to an increase in population size of @xmath128 in a flux - limited sample if the population is in a constant volume ( as might be expected for soft x - ray sources , since the exponential cutoff of interstellar absorption limits their detectability to @xmath6kpc ) .",
    "if the volume can increase too , we get an additional factor of @xmath127 in the population ( assuming the population is confined to the galactic disk )",
    ". the true situation will probably be in between these extremes . with @xmath115 typically between 2 and 3 at a few @xmath125yr ( for photon cooling ) , a factor of at most a few increase in luminosity ( due to field decay ) would lead to a factor of @xmath129 increase in population .",
    "therefore , the ins would represent between one quarter and half the total population .    as an aside",
    ", we note that an interesting implication of the model of @xcite is that neutron stars may be hotter on the equator than at the poles , a combination of joule heating from field decay and reduced conductivity preventing the heat from going inward . while the effect may be quite small at the ages of the ins",
    ", this may still complicate the interpretation of the lightcurve and phase - resolved spectroscopy of the ins .",
    "typically , a model with a warm pole and cool equator is assumed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although more complicated models have also been considered @xcite . if the geometry were reversed that could lead to different interpretations , and work is on - going to see if there are clear consequences to that ( w.  c.  g.  ho , 2009 , pers .",
    "the asymmetry between equator and pole is time- and field - dependent , being most apparent for strong fields and at early times . for weak fields ,",
    "the standard hot poles are regained .",
    "it may be that the very low pulsed fractions and limits found in sources like rx  j1856.5@xmath03754  and rx  j1605.3 + 3249  are a consequence of being near the time where the surface becomes nearly isothermal , and that this underlies the difficultly in finding geometries that satisfy the observed pulsation limits @xcite .",
    "if there is still a strong , buried toroidal field it could also lead to some ongoing , low - level decay , which might give rise to some of the spectral and temporal evolution seen in rx  j0720.4@xmath03125@xcite , although nothing similar has been seen in the long - term monitoring of other sources (   [ sec : insspectra ] ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "if , as we posit , magnetic field decay has influenced the period evolution of the ins , we can ask what the progenitors and descendants of the ins might be .",
    "@xcite discussed rx  j0720.4@xmath03125  as an old magnetar .",
    "this could still be the case , although based on the models of @xcite the initial magnetic fields for the ins would be close to @xmath130 g and not much higher and would have followed an evolution that only skimmed the parameter range occupied by the magnetars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ppdot ] ) .",
    "the descendants of the stronger - field magnetars would be expected to end up with longer periods .",
    "the ins do not actually seem to be old versions of at least the x - ray - bright hbpsrs .",
    "these hbpsrs mostly have @xmath131 ( although this may partly be a selection effect , as this would increase @xmath132 ) .",
    "using the model of @xcite and evolving typical hbpsrs to ages of @xmath133myr , we would expect @xmath134 , which exceeds by an order of magnitude what the ins have .",
    "these hbpsrs may in fact have magnetic fields close to their initial values with little decay , while the ins started with @xmath135 g and have decayed . a few of the hbpsrs , like psr  b0154 + 61 ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) , psr  j1819@xmath01458 ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) , and psr  j1718@xmath03718 ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , may be more similar , although we have no independent age estimates for those objects . of these , the comparison to psr  j1819@xmath01458 may be particularly interesting , as it emits only sporadic radio bursts as a so - called `` rotating radio transient '' ( rrat ; @xcite ) .",
    "the possibilities of a connection between the rrats and the ins have already been discussed in several places ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the spectral similarities @xcite and the recent detection of extended x - ray emission from psr  j1819@xmath01458 that seems too large for its @xmath62 @xcite highlight it even further .",
    "the connection can only go so far , though : searches for rrat - like radio emission from the ins have not been successful @xcite .    as for the descendants of the ins , while they might be too faint for x - ray detection , they could still be apparent in radio surveys ( although there are observational selection effects against long - period objects ) .",
    "however , very few objects are known in that part of the @xmath122 diagram , and there are not enough to span the expected ages of up to @xmath142yr . does this mean that the old ins have very narrow radio beams that miss the earth , therefore reducing their prevalence in radio surveys ? or are there no radio beams ?",
    "will the surfaces condense to allow the formation of vacuum gaps ( @xcite ) or is this inhibited ?",
    "this is largely a function of composition and state , which , as we discussed , remains uncertain .",
    "the h@xmath115 nebula around rx  j1856.5@xmath03754  might be taken as evidence for the generation of energetic particles ( @xcite ) , but the required @xmath62 is far higher than what is inferred from timing @xcite .",

    ", auto - ionizing transitions may play a role ) or elements beyond hydrogen we do not know , but ongoing work in obtaining better timing constraints as well as phase - resolved spectroscopy should help to narrow the possibilities .",

    "are that some neutron stars with magnetic field decay should be hotter at the equator than at the poles , in contrast with most assumed models of neutron star surface temperature distributions .",
