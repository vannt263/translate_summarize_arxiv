    "the nature of quantum state has been debated since the inception of quantum theory ( qt ) @xcite .",
    "does it represent the physical reality or observer s knowledge about the system ?",
    "in the _ ontological models _ framework , introduced by harrigan and spekkens @xcite , this discussion has been made much more precise . an ontological model which aims to reproduce quantum predictions ,",
    "can be of two types  @xmath0-ontic or @xmath0-epistemic @xcite .",
    "the model is said to be @xmath0-epistemic if it considers the quantum mechanical state @xmath0 to represent observer s knowledge about the system .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath0-ontic view point which considers @xmath0 to represent reality of the system .",
    "the de - broglie - bohm model @xcite is an example of this later view point where @xmath0 is given the ontic status .",
    "a @xmath0-ontic model can be incomplete , however , in the sense that the quantum mechanical state @xmath0 does not provide the complete description of reality , all by itself .",
    "this is the case with the de - broglie - bohm model where although @xmath0 is a part of the reality , but it does not provide the complete reality of the system .",
    "the complete description is obtained when it is supplemented by the positions of the particles .",
    "not all the predictions of quantum theory are compatible with those of a _ local - realistic _ theory .",
    "quantum theory also shows contradiction with a noncontextual hidden variable theory ( hvt ) .",
    "the incompatibility of quantum theory with _",
    "local - realism _ was first established by bell @xcite . on the other hand kochen and specker ( ks )",
    "have shown that any realistic interpretation for a quantum system described by hilbert space of dimension greater than two must be _ contextual _ @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ contextuality _ has been generalized recently by spekkens @xcite where he has demonstrated _ preparation contextuality _ of a completely mixed state of a qubit . in a subsequent work",
    ", he , along with harrigan , has shown that in order to rule out the locality of any theory in which @xmath0 has got an ontic status , one does not need bell s inequality , a straightforward argument based on preparation contextuality of completely mixed state of a qubit and steerability of maximally entangled state of two qubits suffice @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite further remark that bell s inequality is only necessary to rule out locality for @xmath0-epistemic hvt .",
    "surprisingly , in a very recent development , liefer and maroney have demonstrated the nonlocality even for a @xmath0-epistemic model without any use of bell s inequality @xcite provided the model is not _",
    "maximally @xmath0-epistemic_.    in this article , we pose the question in a different way : whether this approach of revealing nonlocality by preparation contextuality and steerability , can be extended to demonstrate nonlocality of any bipartite pure entangled state ?",
    "this question is similar in spirit to the question asked by nicolas gisin in @xcite .",
    "bell established the nonlocality of quantum mechanics by means of an inequality which is violated by the singlet state of a pair of qubits .",
    "later , a few other states were discovered which also violate this inequality and thus forbid any local - realistic description for them .",
    "but , all these led to a very natural and very important question ; whether this contradiction between qt and local - realism is typical or it is restricted to some very special cases . in @xcite , gisin answered the question by showing that any pure entangled state of a bipartite system violates a bell s inequality and thus is nonlocal .",
    "we also answer our question affirmatively by showing that the nonlocality of any bipartite pure entangled state , with schmidt rank greater than two , follows from preparation contextuality of mixed quantum states and steerability of entangled states @xcite . on the other hand , for the entangled states with schmidt rank two",
    ", nonlocality can be demonstrated in the above fashion ( i.e. from preparation contextuality steering ) provided we impose certain condition on the epistemicity of the underlying ontological model .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section-[sec2 ] , we briefly describe the ontological model framework of an operational theory .",
    "section-[sec3 ] starts with a brief description of the generalized notion of _ contextuality_. here , we adapt the proof of @xcite to show that any mixed state of a qubit is preparation contextual .",
    "but , this preparation contextuality can not be directly linked to the nonlocality of entangled states . in this section",
    ", we also discuss the reason behind this .",
    "however , if some extra condition is put on the @xmath0-epistemic model , the preparation contextuality can be linked with the nonlocality of any pure bipartite state which is the subject matter of section-[sec4 ] .",
    "we start with briefly discussing the ontological model framework for an operational theory as introduced by harrigan and spekkens in @xcite .",
    "the goal of an operational theory is merely to specify the probabilities @xmath1 of different outcomes @xmath2 that may result from a measurement procedure @xmath3 given a particular preparation procedure @xmath4 , and a particular transformation procedure @xmath5 ; where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively denote the sets of measurement procedures , preparation procedures and transformation procedures ; @xmath9 denotes the set of measurement results for the measurement m. when there is no transformation procedure , we simply have @xmath10 . the only restrictions on @xmath11",
    "is that all of them are non negative and @xmath12 @xmath13 m , p. as an example , in an operational formulation of qt , every preparation p is associated with a density operator @xmath14 on hilbert space , and every measurement m is associated with a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath15 .",
    "the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath16 is given by the generalized born rule , @xmath17 .",
    "whereas an operational theory does not tell anything about _ physical state _ of the system , in an ontological model of an operational theory , the primitives of description are the properties of microscopic systems .",
    "a preparation procedure is assumed to prepare a system with certain properties and a measurement procedure is assumed to reveal something about those properties . a complete specification of the properties of a system is referred to as the ontic state of that system . in an ontological model for qt a particular preparation method ( context ) @xmath18 of the quantum state @xmath14 actually yields a probability distribution @xmath19 over the ontic state @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the ontic state space .",
    "@xmath19 is called the _ epistemic state _ associated with @xmath14 and it must satisfy : @xmath22 the probability of obtaining the @xmath16th outcome is given by the response function , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the particular measurement method ( context ) used . when contextuality is not relevant , the notations @xmath18 and @xmath24 will be omitted .    for the ontological model to reproduce quantum predictions for a quantum mechanical state @xmath14 ,",
    "the following must be satisfied @xmath25 in special cases , when pure quantum states are associated with preparation and measurements are projective , the above relation reduces to @xmath26    an ontological model is considered to be _",
    "@xmath0-ontic _ if the specification of the ontic state @xmath27 uniquely determines the quantum state @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for this to be true , it is necessary that the preparations of any pair of different quantum states , @xmath0 and @xmath28 , should yield ontic state distributions whose supports , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , do not overlap .",
    "hence , the epistemic states associated with distinct quantum states are completely non - overlapping in a @xmath0-ontic model . in other words ,",
    "different quantum states pick out disjoint regions of @xmath21 .",
    "a variation of @xmath0 , therefore , implies a variation of reality .    if an ontological model fails to be _",
    "@xmath0-ontic _ , then it is said to be _ @xmath0-epistemic _ ,",
    "i.e. , the class @xmath0-epistemic was merely defined as the complement of @xmath0-ontic . in a @xmath0-epistemic model ,",
    "distinct quantum states are consistent with the same state of reality , i.e. , variation of @xmath0 does not necessarily imply a variation of reality .",
    "it is in this sense , quantum states are judged epistemic in such models .",
    "there is possibility of _",
    "trivial @xmath0-epistemic _ models , such as ones for which there is only a single pair of states , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , for which @xmath30 and @xmath29 overlap",
    ". however , there are _ nontrivial @xmath0-epistemic _ models . indeed , aaronson et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that there are maximally - nontrivial @xmath0-epistemic models , for which the supports @xmath30 and @xmath29 overlap for every non - orthogonal pair , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these models can be constructed for any finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "very recently maroney has introduced the concept of _ degree of epistemicity _ of an ontological model @xcite . in the ontological model",
    "the following elementary relation holds : @xmath33 the first line follows from the fact that an ontic state @xmath27 that is compatible with the state preparation @xmath32 must assign value @xmath34 to the response function @xmath35 .",
    "the above equation can be expressed as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 . in a _",
    "@xmath0-ontic _ theory , @xmath38 for every pair of different quantum states .",
    "an ontological model will be called _",
    "maximally @xmath0-epistemic _ if @xmath39 for all @xmath32 and @xmath31 , otherwise the model will be called _",
    "nonmaximally @xmath0-epistemic_. the kochen - specker model for a spin-@xmath40 system is a nice example of a maximally @xmath0-epistemic model .",
    "however , such a model is not possible for hilbert spaces of dimensions three or more @xcite .",
    "the traditional notion of _ contextuality _ @xcite was generalized by spekkens in @xcite and has been discussed more elaborately in ref.@xcite . while the well known notion of ks - contextuality@xcite is applicable for sharp ( projective/ von - neumann ) measurements of qt only , this generalized notion of contextuality is applicable to an arbitrary operational theory rather than just to qt and to arbitrary experimental procedures ( preparation procedure , transformation procedure as well as unsharp measurement procedure ) rather than just to sharp measurements and also it is applicable to a broad class of ontological models of qt rather than just to deterministic hidden variable models .    as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the role of an operational theory is merely to specify the probabilities @xmath41 of different outcomes @xmath16 that may result from a measurement procedure @xmath6 given a particular preparation procedure @xmath7 . given the rule for determining probabilities of outcomes , one can define a notion of equivalence among experimental procedures .",
    "two preparation procedures are deemed equivalent if they yield the same long - run statistics for every possible measurement procedure , that is , @xmath7 is equivalent to @xmath42 if : @xmath43 it might happen that the mere specification of the equivalence class of a procedure does not specify the procedure completely .",
    "the set of features of an experimental procedure which are not specified by specifying the equivalence class is called the _ context _ of the experimental procedure .",
    "an ontological model is called _ noncontextual _ if the representation of every experimental procedure in the model depends only on the equivalence class and not on its contexts .    in an ontological model for qt",
    ", an equivalence class of preparation procedures is associated with a density operator @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the model will be called _ preparation non - contextual _ if it associates a single epistemic state @xmath44 with a given density operator , @xmath14 , regardless of its context of preparation . conversely a model is said to be _ preparation contextual _",
    "if the epistemic state that it assigns to @xmath14 depends on the context of its preparation , i.e. there exist different contexts of preparation @xmath18 and @xmath45 giving rise to the same density operator @xmath14 such that @xmath46 .",

    "it seems that nonlocality of a general @xmath0-epistemic model will not follow from steering due to the possibility of the second implication of preparation contextuality ( mentioned in section-[sec3 ] ) .",
    "but , interestingly , in a recent development , it has been shown that just a little loss of epistemicity ( in the sense that overlap of the ontic supports of at least one pair of nonorthogonal pure states is strictly less than the quantum overlap ) makes nonlocality of such models to follow from steering @xcite .",
    "extension of this loss of epistemicity ( i.e. , for every pure state there exists at least another nonorthogonal pure state such that overlap of their ontic supports is strictly less than the quantum overlap ) makes it possible to prove even gisin - like theorem @xcite for a two - qubit pure entangled state by using steering .",
    "we have also established the nonlocality of a bipartite pure entangled state almost in the same spirit as gisin s theorem but the proof ( without any further assumption on epestemic character of the underlying ontological model ) works for states with schmidt rank greater than two . whether this kind of nonlocality proof can be extended to mixed entangled state or to a class of mixed entangled states",
    "remains a gray area of further research .",
    "recently , m. s. leifer have written a review on @xmath0-ontology theorems @xcite . among many open questions listed in there one",
    "is concerned about preparation contextuality proof for any mixed quantum state .",
    "this question is addressed in our paper and we have answered affirmatively .",
