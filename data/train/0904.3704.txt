    "it is well known that adequate relativistic modelling is indispensable for the success of microarcsecond space astrometry .",
    "one of the most important relativistic effects for astrometric observations in the solar system is the gravitational light deflection .",
    "the largest contribution in the light deflection comes from the spherically symmetric ( schwarzschild ) parts of the gravitational fields of each solar system body .",
    "although the planned astrometric satellites gaia , sim , etc . will not observe very close to the sun , they can observe very close to the giant planets also producing significant light deflection .",
    "this poses the problem of modelling this light deflection with a numerical accuracy of better than 1 .",
    "the exact differential equation of motion for a light ray in the schwarzschild field can be solved numerically as well as analytically . however , the exact analytical solution is given in terms of elliptic integrals , implying numerical efforts comparable with direct numerical integration , so that approximate analytical solutions are usually used .",
    "in fact , the standard parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) solution is sufficient in many cases and has been widely applied . so far , there was no doubt that the post - newtonian order of approximation is sufficient for astrometric missions even up to microarcsecond level of accuracy , besides astrometric observations close to the edge of the sun .",
    "however , a direct comparison reveals a deviation between the standard post - newtonian approach and the exact numerical solution of the geodetic equations .",
    "in particular , we have found a difference of up to 16  in light deflection for solar system objects observed close to giant planets .",
    "this error has triggered detailed numerical and analytical investigations of the problem .    usually , in the framework of general relativity or the ppn formalism analytical orders of smallness of various terms are considered . here",
    "the role of small parameter is played by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the light velocity .",
    "standard post - newtonian and post - post - newtonian solutions are derived by retaining terms of relevant analytical orders of magnitude . on the other hand , for practical calculations",
    "only numerical magnitudes of various terms are relevant . in this note",
    "we attempt to close this gap and combine the analytical post - post - newtonian solution derived in @xcite with estimates of numerical magnitudes of various terms . in this way we will derive a compact analytical solution for the boundary problem for light propagation where all terms are indeed relevant at the level of 1 .",
    "the derived analytical solution is then verified using high - accuracy numerical integration of the differential equations of light propagation and found to be correct at the level well below 1 .",
