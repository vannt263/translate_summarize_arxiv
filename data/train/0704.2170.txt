    "intermetallic kondo lattice systems have attracted considerable attention in the last decades . in these systems , two different interactions determine the ground state properties , which can be understood in a simple way in terms of the doniach picture .",
    "@xcite the formation of a nonmagnetic kondo singlet competes with the formation of a magnetic ordered ground state ; @xcite in the case of dominating kondo interactions , the magnetic moments of the @xmath9 electrons are screened by the conduction electrons , and a nonmagnetic ground state develops . if the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange interaction exceeds the kondo screening , long range magnetic order occurs .",
    "while many ce - based kondo lattices show antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground states , only very few systems are known with ferromagnetic ( fm ) order and pronounced kondo effects .",
    "therefore , the behavior at a fm critical point in a kondo lattice is presently not settled .",
    "@xcite from the few fm kondo systems known , the best studied examples are ybnisn , @xcite cesi@xmath10 , @xcite and the compound - series cepd@xmath11rh@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite however , in the former compound pressure stabilizes the magnetic state , preventing a study of the critical region . in the latter",
    ", disorder is not negligible and may hide the intrinsic physical properties . on the way to look for new ce - based kondo lattice systems close to a fm quantum phase transition , the cetpo ( t = transition metal ) compound series attracted our interest , because of the rather unusual crystal structure with alternating layers of tp@xmath13 and oce@xmath13 tetrahedra , causing ce - ce inter - atomic distances to be in the range where fm order can be observed .",
    "@xcite this compound series , crystallizing with the tetragonal zrcusias type structure , was discovered by the jeitschko group ; @xcite but no physical properties have been reported for cerupo .",
    "the compound ceospo has not been synthesized before .",
    "recently , lafepo was found to be superconducting , supporting the interest in this class of material .",
    "@xcite    in this contribution , we will present the low temperature physical properties of cerupo and ceospo .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section [ prep ] we will discuss the details of the sample preparation and the crystal structure . the physical properties of cerupo are presented in detail in section [ cerupo ] and compared with the results of ceospo in section [ ceospo ] .",
    "we present and discuss @xmath7p nmr results for both compounds in section [ nmr ] .",
    "finally , in section [ theory ] we show band structure calculations of both compounds using an lsda+@xmath8 approach and analyze the bonding properties and the magnetic exchange .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were prepared using a sn - flux method in evacuated quartz tubes .",
    "@xcite for cerupo the preparation was optimized with ruo@xmath14 as the source for the oxygen .",
    "we found the best growing conditions for an initial molar ratio of 8:6:4:82 ( ce : p : ruo@xmath14:sn ) .",
    "this preparation route was also used to obtain the larupo compound , serving as the nonmagnetic reference .",
    "ceospo was prepared with sno@xmath14 instead of the hazardous osmiumtetraoxide . for this compound we found the best results for the initial molar ratio of 4:3:2:2:89 ( ce : os : p : sno@xmath14:sn ) .",
    "the heating schedule was similar for all preparation cycles .",
    "the starting mixture was heated with a rate of 100@xmath15c per hour to 1000@xmath15c and kept at this temperature for 5 hours ; subsequently , the melt was cooled down to 500@xmath15c by moving the quartz tube out of the furnace with an average cooling rate of 5@xmath15c per hour . after the reaction the excess sn was dissolved in dilute hcl which attacks the cetpo at a lower rate .",
    "small single crystals ( @xmath16@xmath17 m ) of cetpo are attached to each other forming flake - like polycrystals which were ground and pelletized for further physical characterization .",
    "several samples were investigated with energy dispersive x - ray analysis .",
    "these measurements reveal a stoichiometric ce : ru : p content and confirmed the presence of oxygen in the compounds ; furthermore , no foreign phases could be detected .",
    "in addition , carrier gas - hot extraction ( leco , tch 600 ) was used to determine the oxygen content @xmath18 of cerupo more precisely .",
    "the result of @xmath19at% indicates a stoichiometric oxygen occupancy .",
    "several powder x - ray diffraction patterns recorded on a stoe diffractometer in transmission mode using a monochromated cu - k@xmath20 radiation ( @xmath21 ) confirmed the formation of single phase cetpo .",
    "the lattice parameters refined by simple least square fitting for cerupo ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and larupo ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) were found to be in good agreement with the reported single crystal data .",
    "@xcite for ceospo , the first refinement was performed using an internal silicon standard yielding @xmath26 , @xmath27@xmath28 , which was later confirmed in various measurements from different batches .",
    "the tetragonal structure of cetpo with the space group _ p4/nmm _ is shown in fig .",
    "[ figstr ] , it consists of alternating layers of face sharing tp@xmath13 and oce@xmath13 tetrahedra .",
    "the two dimensional nature of this lattice in which the ceo layers are well separated by tp layers , together with the presence of conduction electrons , opens up a lot of possibilities for interesting electron - mediated magnetic interactions .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed in the temperature range from @xmath29k in a commercial quantum design ( qd ) magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) equipped with an rso option .",
    "the polycrystalline cerupo material was powdered , mixed with paraffin , and aligned in a magnetic field of @xmath30 t at 80@xmath15c .",

    "the inverse susceptibility shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figmvt ] supports that this transition comes from local ce@xmath34 moments because the data for @xmath35k can be fitted with a curie weiss law with an effective moment of @xmath36@xmath37/ce close to that of the free ion moment ( @xmath38/ce ) .",

    "the change of slope and of @xmath39 can be attributed to the effect of the crystal electric field ( cef ) .",
    "a fm state is also evidenced by the magnetization measurements at 2 k on the same sample , shown in fig .",

    "a small but well defined hysteresis can be discerned ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ figmvh ] ) .",
    "however , for the oriented powder the saturation magnetization @xmath44 per ce atom is only reached at 1.2 t . also the peak observed at low field in the susceptibility measurements does not correspond to the expectation for a simple ferromagnet .",
    "the height of this peak varies from sample to sample but is not solely due to domain reorientation because it was also observed in a field cooling experiment ( open symbols in fig .  [ figmvt ] ) .",
    "presently , it is not clear whether these observations are the result of measuring powder samples of a system with a complex anisotropic behavior , like e.g. , a competition between cef and exchange interaction as in ybnisn ; @xcite or if they point to a more complex magnetic structure , e.g. , a spiral with a very small propagation vector @xmath45 . up to now",
    ", we could not succeed in growing single crystals large enough to measure the orientation dependence of physical properties , to determine the magnetic anisotropy of this system .",
    "however , similar behavior of the susceptibility was observed in the fm compound tbzrsb , crystallizing in a related structure .",
    "@xcite    ac - transport resistivity measurements were performed in a standard four - probe geometry using a commercial qd physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the powdered material was pelletized and subsequently annealed at 1200@xmath15c to improve crystallinity .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figrvt ] .",
    "three different temperature regions can be identified : ( i ) above 50k , the sample shows a linear behavior typical of a conventional metal .",
    "( ii ) below 50k , there is a pronounced decrease , deviating from the linear behavior which is a distinct feature of a kondo lattice system .",
    "this decrease can be explained by the onset of coherent kondo scattering due to the hybridization between the localized @xmath9 and the conduction electrons .",
    "( iii ) the fm order is clearly visible in a distinct anomaly at @xmath5k . in the ordered state ,",
    "the resistivity follows a power law dependence with @xmath46 .",
    "all these features are reproducible , and the very good sample quality ( residual resistivity @xmath47 cm ) validates the intrinsic nature of these anomalies . in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ figrvt ] , the resistivity of the nonmagnetic reference sample larupo is shown which is typical for an usual metal without any anomalies down to 0.5k . our aim to visualize the high temperature kondo maximum in the resistivity of cerupo by subtracting",
    "the nonmagnetic data from the resistivity of the cerupo sample failed because the room temperature resistivity value of larupo is with 700@xmath48 cm one order of magnitude larger than the value of cerupo and makes a subtraction very arbitrary .",
    "this higher resistivity value of larupo is not intrinsic , but can be ascribed to the granularity of the sample .",
    "however , the presence of kondo interaction in cerupo is further supported by thermopower measurements which will be discussed below .",
    "the specific heat was determined with the ppms using a standard heat - pulse relaxation technique .",
    "the @xmath9 contribution to the specific heat @xmath49 of cerupo was obtained by subtracting the measured specific heat of the nonmagnetic reference sample larupo ( @xmath50 ) from the specific heat of the cerupo polycrystals ( @xmath51 ) as @xmath52 .",
    "the result is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ figctvt ] , plotted as @xmath53 vs @xmath33 for different magnetic fields .",
    "a large @xmath54-type anomaly is evident at @xmath5k , indicating a second order transition into the magnetic state .",
    "the fm nature of the transition is supported by the field dependence of the @xmath54-type anomaly .",
    "the transition temperature shifts to higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field ; the maximum gets broader and reaches 20k at @xmath55 t .",
    "the extrapolated value of the linear part of the total specific heat @xmath56 at @xmath57k gives @xmath58mj / molk@xmath59 , which is enhanced by a factor of 20 compared to the value @xmath60mj / molk@xmath59 that we observe in larupo .",
    "this enhancement can be attributed to the @xmath9-correlation effects .",
    "the entropy gain at 20k is @xmath61 and is slightly shifted to higher temperatures if magnetic field is applied . at higher temperatures ( @xmath62k ) , @xmath49 does not go to zero , indicating further excitations from the @xmath9 electrons .",
    "this contribution to the specific heat is shown in the inset and can be explained by a broad schottky anomaly , resulting from excitations to cef levels of two excited kramer s doublets at 6 and 30mev above the doublet ground state . for ce@xmath34 with @xmath63 in a tetragonal environment ,",
    "one expects for the cef states a ground state doublet and two excited doublets .",
    "the entropy confirms low lying cef levels because at 150k already 90% of @xmath64 is reached , which is the total entropy of the whole multiplet ( see lower inset of fig .",
    "[ figctvt ] ) .",
    "the absence of a plateau in the entropy around @xmath61 indicates that the first excited cef level is not far above @xmath65 . from the reduced jump height of the specific heat at the ordering temperature @xmath66j / molk , it is possible to estimate the ratio of @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the order of magnitude of the kondo energy scale is @xmath68k , which is in accordance with the onset of coherent kondo scattering at 50k in the resistivity . in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ figctvt ] , we show the temperature dependence of the derivative of the resistivity , @xmath69 vs @xmath33 .",
    "the anomaly in the resistivity shown in fig .",
    "[ figrvt ] is clearly visible in this plot , showing a sharp peak at @xmath65 .",
    "this peak behaves very similar to that in the specific heat , both at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "such a pronounced similarity has been reported and analyzed by campoy _",
    "@xcite    to further study the influence of the kondo interaction on the transport properties of cerupo , we performed thermal transport ( tt ) measurements on bar shaped polycrystalline samples in a four - probe geometry , using the tt option of the ppms . among other transport measurements , the thermopower is of particular interest because it is extremely sensitive to any variation of the density of states at the fermi level and exhibits large values ( 10 - 100@xmath17v / k ) for kondo lattice systems .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of the thermopower @xmath3 of cerupo is shown in fig .",
    "[ figtto ] , plotted on a logarithmic temperature scale .",
    "@xmath3 has a broad minimum at 150k ( which is negative ) , followed by a strong increase below 100k to a maximum at 35k with absolute values as high as 18@xmath17v / k . a pronounced minimum at @xmath65 separate this first maximum from a second one at 10k .",
    "at lower temperatures ( @xmath72k ) , the thermopower goes within the error bars linearly to zero .",
    "this behavior of @xmath3 was reproduced in a different sample .",
    "large positive maxima are common in many ce - based kondo lattice systems and can be ascribed to the kondo scattering of the different cef levels .",
    "@xcite since the cef maximum in the thermopower is usually observed around half of the splitting energy , @xcite the peak at 35k in cerupo can therefore be nicely attributed to the first excited cef level at 6mev , visible also in the magnetic part of the specific heat .",
    "the peak position is unaffected by a magnetic field , which confirms the cef origin . at lower temperatures ( @xmath73k ) , the @xmath33-dependence of @xmath3 results from an interplay between kondo effect and fm ordering . because of the lack of fm kondo systems , the effect of this interplay on @xmath3 has not yet been studied .",
    "the only fm kondo lattice system where thermopower measurements were performed is the related compound ceagsb@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite however , ceagsb@xmath14 presents a strong decrease of @xmath3 below @xmath74 , in contrast to the increase observed in cerupo .",
    "the shift of the minimum in @xmath3 of cerupo to higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field indicate that it arises from fm correlations .",
    "a likely explanation of the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is that in the absence of fm correlations , @xmath3 would present a broad maximum due to both kondo effect and cef splitting , @xcite as the involved energy scales ( @xmath75 ) are close to each other .",
    "fm inter - site fluctuations lead to a reduction of @xmath3 at @xmath65 , this reduction becoming weaker and shifting to higher @xmath33 with increasing magnetic field .",
    "then , the field dependence of the low temperature maximum would just be a consequence of the field dependence of the minimum . to understand the observed behavior in more detail ,",
    "theoretical predictions for @xmath76 in fm kondo systems are necessary .",
    "the dc - susceptibility @xmath0 under pressure up to 2gpa was measured in a qd - mpms using a diamond ( 0.25 carat ) anvil cell with a culet size of 1.5 mm . as gasket we used a cube disk with a bore of 800@xmath17 m in diameter",
    "daphne oil served as pressure transmitting medium .",
    "the pressure inside the cell was determined by the inductively measured shift of the superconducting transition temperature of lead ( pb ) placed next to the cerupo sample , relative to a pb sample outside of the cell . in fig .",
    "[ figpress ] , @xmath0 is shown as function of @xmath33 for different pressures . for 1.4gpa and 2.0gpa",
    "no significant changes in the temperature dependence of @xmath0 are observed ; and therefore , @xmath65 stays constant up to 2.0gpa . in ce",

    "further experiments with an extended pressure range are needed to study the influence of pressure in cerupo in more detail .",
    "another way to suppress magnetic order is to dope the system chemically with an isoelectronic element which leads to stronger hybridization and favors the kondo interaction .",
    "since @xmath78 metals usually cause stronger hybridization than @xmath79 metals , we have synthesized ceospo . as discussed above",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "[ figmvtos ] ) is typical for an afm ordered system because the magnitude of the susceptibility is nearly field independent .",

    "this ordering temperature decreases ; for clarity , we only show the data points for three selected magnetic fields . at @xmath83k",

    "we did not subtract any phonon contribution which at low temperatures is negligible compared to the large mean field type anomaly at @xmath6k , indicating that the magnetic order is a bulk property of ceospo .",
    "the entropy gain involved in the magnetic transition is close to @xmath61 at 10k .",
    "the transition becomes broader if magnetic field is applied and @xmath86 shifts to lower temperatures , in accordance with the afm nature of the transition .",

    "[ figcvtos ] which shows @xmath85 in the whole measured temperature range . up to now , we were not able to perform any reproducible transport measurements of ceospo due to difficulties in preparing a compact sample of sufficient size .",
    "we confirmed the conclusions drawn from thermodynamic and transport measurements , using results obtained with a microscopic technique , namely @xmath7p nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "these measurements were performed on polycrystalline samples with a standard pulsed nmr spectrometer at a fixed frequency of about 70mhz and in the temperature range between 2 and 300k .",
    "the nmr field sweep spectra were obtained by tracing the intensity of the echo as a function of field , using a common spin - echo sequence .",

    "the assignment of these components is clearly given by the fact that the highest intensity in the powder pattern is attributed to the @xmath92 direction .",
    "a plot @xmath94 vs @xmath95 ( measured on oriented powder in a magnetic field of 4 t ) , see inset of fig .",

    "@xcite @xmath90 is positive and reaches its maximum value of about + 17% at 2k .",

    "@xcite in cerupo , @xmath103 presents a well defined maximum around 35k before decreasing significantly at lower temperatures and merging in a linear in @xmath33 behavior below 10k .",
    "since the temperature of the maximum corresponds to the onset of coherent kondo scattering in @xmath2 , this maximum could be attributed to the onset of the kondo effect .",
    "however , the observation that this maximum shifts to lower temperature and becomes more pronounced with decreasing magnetic field indicates that it is also related to the onset of fm correlations .",
    "@xcite a separation of both effects is presently not possible .",
    "in contrast , in ceospo @xmath105 becomes @xmath33-independent between 60 and 6k before it starts to decrease towards lower temperatures .",

    "the decrease of @xmath105 in ceospo below 6k ends in a pronounced drop at the temperature corresponding to @xmath86 at the field strength of the nmr experiment .",
    "the absence of a critical fluctuation induced maximum in @xmath105 at @xmath65 in cerupo and at @xmath86 in ceospo might be due to the broadening effect of the applied field in the former one and/or to the cancellation of these fluctuations at the p - site in the latter one .",

    "this approach seems to be quite appropriate for the present compounds , since the difference between @xmath103 of cerupo and larupo first increases strongly with decreasing temperature passes through a maximum around 30k before vanishing at low @xmath33 .",

    "the corresponding densities of states ( dos ) and band structures ( fm for cerupo and g - afm for ceospo ) are shown in fig.[dosen ] .    at first glance",
    "both band structures and dos s look very similar . note that for the os compound ( see fig.[dosen ] , upper panel ) the number of bands is doubled due to the doubled number of atoms in the magnetic super cell , resulting in a folding of the band structure ( @xmath130 and m are identical in the chosen notation of symmetry points referring to the original non - magnetic unit cell ) .",
    "the filled valence states originate essentially from p and o @xmath131 and from the transition metal states .",
    "the states between about -2ev and 0.5ev are dominated by the transition metal @xmath117 electrons . in the lda calculations (",

    "thus , the magnetic ce spin moment is about @xmath132 for both compounds .",
    "all other atoms show negligible spin polarization , including ru and os .",
    "this can be seen from the very small split of the ru related bands between -2ev and 0.5ev ( see fig.[dosen ] , lower panel ) , especially close to the fermi level .",

    "this justifies the application of the lsda+@xmath8 approximation although the actual value of @xmath8 may vary slightly .",
    "therefore , in a first approximation the magnetic interaction in the two compounds can be understood from an rkky type mechanism with rather localized ce @xmath9 states coupled by the itinerant transition metal @xmath117 electrons .",
    "on the other hand one should keep in mind that all dynamic correlation effects are neglected in the lsda+@xmath8 approximation and would require a more sophisticated theoretical treatment .",
    "fig.[bands ] shows the detailed band structure close to the fermi level for cerupo ( lower panel ) and ceospo ( upper panel ) together with the transition metal @xmath117 band characters .",
    "note again the doubled number of bands for the os compound due to the magnetic super cell , otherwise the resulting bands are very similar . neglecting the small spin split for the ru @xmath79 related bands in cerupo , we observe a very close similarity with the related superconductor lafepo .",
    "@xcite    the characteristic feature in the cerupo and ceospo band structures is the strongly pronounced two dimensionality . the in - plane dispersion ( along @xmath130-x - m-@xmath130 ) exceeds the out of plane dispersion ( along @xmath130-z ) by far more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the underlying reason is the layer type crystal structure , resulting in a rather weak hybridization between adjacent metallic t - p layers .",
    "the interaction along the @xmath134 direction is mainly mediated by the o @xmath135 orbitals of the otherwise non - metallic ce - o layers . on the other hand , the slightly different oxygen hybridization in both compounds is most likely the reason for the different magnetic ground states .",
    "whereas in ceospo the bands crossing the fermi level are mostly dispersionless along @xmath130-z , one of the bands in cerupo shows sizable dispersion along the z direction ( see fig.[bands ] ) .",
    "the corresponding band in the os compound is slightly lower in energy and therefore less relevant for the magnetic interaction .",
    "compared to the other t - derived bands , the t-@xmath117 character of this band is somewhat reduced due to the hybridization with p and o @xmath131 electrons . due to the two dimensional electronic structure , the resulting fermi surfaces ( not shown ) are almost cylindrical tubes in the case of ceospo . in cerupo one of the cylinders",
    "closes due to the dispersion along the @xmath134-direction and forms an ellipsoid around the z point like in lafepo .",
    "@xcite to understand the magnetic properties of the two compounds in more detail , further more sophisticated studies , including the investigation of the role of nesting properties , are necessary .",
    "our results on cerupo and ceospo evidence three interesting features which shall now be discussed : the fm ordering and the kondo behavior in cerupo , and the quasi two dimensionality . in the absence of more detailed information because of lack of single crystals or larger samples for neutron scattering experiments , a deeper insight into the magnetic exchange interaction in these systems can be gained by a comparison with rtx compounds ( r = rare earth , x = si , ge ) crystallizing in the cefesi structure .",
    "the arrangement of the r , t , and x atoms in this structure is identical to the presented compounds , the only difference is the insertion of o atoms between adjacent ce - planes .",
    "b. chevalier and b. malaman @xcite discussed the magnetic order in these rtx compounds using a simple model with three exchange interactions : @xmath136 within an r - plane ( this corresponds to the next nearest r - r - neighbor ) , @xmath137 between r atoms separated by a tx - layer , and @xmath138 between adjacent r - planes sandwiching an o - layer ( this corresponds to the nearest r - r - neighbor ) .",
    "systematic studies of these rtx compounds showed that @xmath136 is always positive ( fm ) , while @xmath137 and @xmath138 change sign depending on the t element .",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 are positive in the rfesi light rare earth compounds , while @xmath139 , @xmath140 for t = co , ti , and @xmath141 , @xmath142 for t = ru .",
    "the only exception with both @xmath137 and @xmath138 negative is cecoge .",
    "thus , for this type of arrangement of r , t and x atoms there is a clear predominance of fm exchange .",
    "notabene strong ferromagnetism , with @xmath143k in gdtige , has also been observed in the related cescsi structure which differs only in the long range stacking of the layers .",
    "@xcite therefore , the observation of a fm state in cerupo is not surprising and can be related to an atomic arrangement promoting fm interactions . comparing the fm state in cerupo with the afm structure found in rrusi(ge ) , the inclusion of an o atom between adjacent ce - layers switches @xmath138 from afm to fm . in absence of more detailed information , it is yet not clear whether the afm structure in ceospo is due to a negative @xmath137 or a negative @xmath138 .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the change in the anisotropy of the hyperfine coupling constant between cerupo and ceospo suggest that at least @xmath137 is becoming afm in the latter one since p is along the corresponding exchange path .",
    "@xcite    as already stated , only very few fm kondo lattices have been reported previously .",
    "none of them show such a strong decrease in the resistivity starting far above @xmath65 as we observed in cerupo . as an example ybnisn , ceagsb@xmath14 , @xcite and cesi@xmath144 @xcite present a weak increase in @xmath2 below @xmath145k ending in a maximum at a temperature @xmath146 which is at or only slightly above @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath147 is only slightly smaller than @xmath148 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath2 in cerupo has at @xmath65 decreased to less than 50% of the value at 50k which would roughly correspond to the position of the maximum after subtraction of the phonon scattering .",
    "thus spin flip scattering is already significantly suppressed at @xmath65 , indicating that the kondo fluctuations at @xmath65 are likely much stronger than in the previously known fm kondo lattices .",
    "the most appropriate compound for a detailed comparison is the closely related ceagsb@xmath14 @xcite which crystallizes in the same structure type as cetpo .",
    "however , the much larger size of sb compared to o and p leads to quite different ce - ce , ce - t , and ce - p distances .",
    "nevertheless , ceagsb@xmath14 also orders ferromagnetically at @xmath65 = 9.6 k. while at ambient pressure @xmath2 in ceagsb@xmath14 decreases by only a few percent between @xmath146 and @xmath65 under an isostatic pressure larger than 2.4gpa , its temperature dependence becomes comparable to that in cerupo at @xmath149 ; although , the onset of coherence stays at a much smaller temperature , indicating a smaller @xmath108 .",
    "the ratio rr@xmath150 = @xmath151 in ceagsb@xmath14 at @xmath152gpa which is the highest pressure where the fm transition is still clearly visible is close to rr@xmath153 in cerupo at ambient pressure , suggesting a comparable @xmath154 ratio under these conditions .",
    "however , because of the much lower @xmath155k at @xmath156gpa in ceagsb@xmath14 this also corresponds to a much lower absolute value of @xmath108 . a smaller @xmath108 in ceagsb@xmath14 is further evidenced by the weaker thermopower .",
    "@xcite the larger @xmath108 in cerupo is in accordance with general rules for the strength of hybridization between @xmath157 and conduction electrons first proposed by d.d . koelling",
    "@xcite both the smaller size of p compared to that of isoelectronic sb , and the shift of the @xmath117-states closer to the fermi level upon exchanging ag by ru are expected to lead to a stronger hybridization .",
    "one can also suspect that the replacement of one sb by o has the tendency to push ce towards a higher oxidation state .",
    "the effect of pressure on cerupo and the way in which a further increase of @xmath108 suppress the fm order shall be an important issue for future experiments .",
    "quasi two dimensional ( 2d ) intermetallic kondo lattices have attracted considerable attention in the past years .",
    "the main reason was the discovery of a rather high superconducting transition temperature @xmath158k in cecoin@xmath159 ; the layered structure of this compound is suspected to be at the origin of the enhanced @xmath160 .",
    "@xcite however , the 2d character of these 115 compounds is not very pronounced ; the slope of the upper critical field at @xmath160 e.g. shows only a rather small anisotropy of a factor of two .",
    "only one of the three sheets of the fermi surface of cecoin@xmath159 has a clear 2d character while the two others are clearly 3d .",
    "@xcite thus , intermetallic heavy fermion compounds with a better defined 2d character are of strong interest .",
    "the results of our lda+@xmath8 calculations as well as those on lafepo @xcite suggest that the electronic states at the fermi level of the presented rtpo have a stronger 2d character than in the cetin@xmath159 compounds , since at least four of the five sheets of the fermi surface are 2d .",
    "thus the growth of single crystals large enough for allowing the study of the anisotropy of the transport and electronic properties shall be another important issue for future research .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the cetpo ( t = ru , os ) compound series presents an interesting class of ce - based kondo lattice systems at the border between intermetallic and oxide materials with a layered structure and strong tendency to ferromagnetism .",
    "cerupo seems to be a nice example of a fm kondo lattice ( @xmath5k , @xmath161k ) .",
    "together with the antiferromagnetic ceospo ( @xmath6k ) , these two compounds are ideally suited to study the difference between fm and afm kondo lattices .",
    "this change from the fm state in cerupo to the afm state in ceospo is induced by only minor changes in the crystallographic parameters .",
    "however , further pressure experiments on cerupo are necessary to investigate the interplay between kondo interaction and development of long range magnetic order .",
    "the yet unique combination of quasi two dimensional electronic properties and strong fm correlations could lead to new kind of quantum critical behavior .",
    "furthermore , a systematic study of related derivatives by replacing the t atoms with other @xmath117 elements brings up a lot of possibilities for further interesting materials .",
