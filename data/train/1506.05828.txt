    "coupled oscillator theory is now a pervasive part of the theoretical neuroscientist s toolkit for studying the dynamics of models of biological neural networks .",
    "undoubtedly this technique originally arose in the broader scientific community through a fascination with understanding synchronisation in networks of interacting heterogeneous oscillators , and can be traced back to the work of huygens on  an odd kind of sympathy `` between coupled pendulum clocks '' @xcite .",
    "subsequently the theory has been developed and applied to the interaction between organ pipes @xcite , phase - locking phenomena in electronic circuits @xcite , the analysis of brain rhythms @xcite , chemical oscillations @xcite , cardiac pacemakers @xcite , circadian rhythms @xcite , flashing fireflies @xcite , coupled josephson junctions @xcite , rhythmic applause @xcite , animal flocking @xcite , fish schooling @xcite , and behaviours in social networks @xcite . for a recent overview of the application of coupled phase oscillator theory to areas as diverse as vehicle coordination , electric power networks , and clock synchronisation in decentralised networks",
    "see the recent survey article by drfler and bullo @xcite .    given the widespread nature of oscillations in neural systems it is no surprise that the science of oscillators has found such ready application in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "this has proven especially fruitful for shedding light on the functional role that oscillations can play in feature binding @xcite , cognition @xcite , memory processes @xcite , odour perception @xcite , information transfer mechanisms @xcite , inter - limb coordination @xcite , and the generation of rhythmic motor output @xcite .",
    "neural oscillations also play an important role in many neurological disorders , such as excessive synchronisation during seizure activity in epilepsy @xcite , tremor in patients with parkinson s disease @xcite or disruption of cortical phase synchronisation in schizophrenia @xcite . as such",
    "it has proven highly beneficial to develop methods for the control of ( de)synchronisation in oscillatory networks , as exemplified by the work of tass _ et al_. @xcite for therapeutic brain stimulation techniques . from a transformative technological perspective",
    ", oscillatory activity is increasingly being used to control external devices in brain - computer interfaces , in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of a particular brain rhythm @xcite .",
    "neural oscillations can emerge in a variety of ways , including intrinsic mechanisms within individual neurons or by interactions between neurons . at the single neuron level",
    ", sub - threshold oscillations can be seen in membrane voltage as well as rhythmic patterns of action potentials .",
    "both can be modelled using the hodgkin - huxley conductance formalism , and analysed mathematically with dynamical systems techniques to shed light on the mechanisms that underly various forms of rhythmic behaviour , including tonic spiking and bursting ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the high dimensionality of biophysically realistic single neuron models has also encouraged the use of reduction techniques , such as the separation of time - scales recently reviewed in @xcite , or the use of phenomenological models , such as fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) @xcite , to regain some level of mathematical tractability .",
    "this has proven especially useful when studying the response of single neurons to forcing @xcite , itself a precursor to understanding how networks of interacting neurons can behave .",
    "when mediated by synaptic interactions , the repetitive firing of pre - synaptic neurons can cause oscillatory activation of post - synaptic neurons . at the level of neural ensembles ,",
    "synchronised activity of large numbers of neurons gives rise to macroscopic oscillations , which can be recorded with a micro - electrode embedded within neuronal tissue as a voltage change referred to as a local field potential ( lfp ) .",
    "these oscillations were first observed outside the brain by hans berger in 1924 @xcite in electroencephalogram ( eeg ) recordings , and have given rise to the modern classification of brain rhythms into frequency bands for alpha activity ( 8 - 13 hz ) ( recorded from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness ) , delta ( 1 - 4 hz ) , theta ( 4 - 8 hz ) , beta ( 13 - 30 hz ) and gamma ( 30 - 70 hz ) .",
    "the latter rhythm is often associated with cognitive processing , and it is now common to link large scale neural oscillations with cognitive states , such as awareness and consciousness .",
    "for example , from a practical perspective the monitoring of brain states via eeg is used to determine depth of anaesthesia @xcite .",
    "such macroscopic signals can also arise from interactions between different brain areas , the thalamo - cortical loop being a classic example @xcite .",
    "neural mass models ( describing the coarse grained activity of large populations of neurons and synapses ) have proven especially useful in understanding eeg rhythms @xcite , as well as in augmenting the dynamic causal modelling framework ( driven by large scale neuroimaging data ) for understanding how event - related responses result from the dynamics of coupled neural populations @xcite .",
    "one very influential mathematical technique for analysing networks of neural oscillators , whether they be built from single neuron or neural mass models , has been that of weakly coupled oscillator theory , as comprehensively described by hoppensteadt and izhikevich @xcite . in the limit of weak coupling between limit cycle oscillators invariant manifold theory @xcite and averaging theory @xcite",
    "can be used to reduce the dynamics to a set of phase equations in which the relative phase between oscillators is the relevant dynamical variable .",
    "this approach has been applied to neural behaviour ranging from that seen in small rhythmic networks @xcite up to the whole brain @xcite . despite the powerful tools and wide - spread use afforded by this formalism ,",
    "it does have a number of limitations ( such as assuming the persistence of the limit cycle under coupling ) and it is well to remember that there are other tools from the mathematical sciences relevant to understanding network behaviour . in this review",
    "we wrap the weakly coupled oscillator formalism in a variety of other techniques ranging from symmetric bifurcation theory and groupoid formalisms through to more `` physics - based '' approaches for obtaining reduced models of large networks .",
    "this highlights the regimes where the standard formalism is applicable , and provides a set of complementary tools when it does not .",
    "these are especially useful when investigating systems with strong coupling , or ones for which the rate of attraction to a limit cycle is slow .    in   [ sec :",
    "neuronoscillators ] we review some of the key mathematical models of oscillators in neuroscience , ranging from single neuron to neural mass , as well as introduce the standard machinery for describing synaptic and gap junction coupling .",
    "we then present in ",
    "[ sec : collectivedyns ] an overview of some of the more powerful mathematical approaches to understanding the collective behaviour in coupled oscillator networks , mainly drawn from the theory of symmetric dynamics .",
    "we touch upon the master stability function approach and the groupoid formalism for handling coupled cell systems . in   [ sec : coupledlimitcycles ] we review some special cases where it is either possible to say something about the stability of the globally synchronous state in a general setting , or that of phase - locked states for strongly coupled networks of integrate - and - fire neurons .",
    "the challenge of the general case is laid out in   [ sec : reduced ] , where we advocate the use of phase - amplitude coordinates as a starting point for either direct network analysis or network reduction . to highlight the importance of dynamics off cycle we discuss the phenomenon of shear - induced chaos . in the same section",
    "we review the reduction to the standard phase - only description of an oscillator , covering the well known notions of isochrons and phase response curves .",
    "the construction of phase interaction functions for weakly coupled phase oscillator networks is covered in   [ sec : weakcoupling ] , together with tools for analysing phase - locked states .",
    "moreover , we go beyond standard approaches and describe the emergence of turbulent states in continuum models with non - local coupling .",
    "another example of something more complicated than a periodic attractor is that of a heteroclinic attractor , and these are the subject of   [ sec : heteroclinic ] .",
    "the subtleties of phase reduction in the presence of stochastic forcing are outlined in   [",
    "sec : stochastic ] .",
    "the search for reduced descriptions of very large networks is the topic of ",
    "[ sec : macroscopic ] , where we cover recent results for winfree networks that provide an exact mean - field description in terms of a complex order parameter .",
    "this approach makes use of the ott - antonsen ansatz that has also found application to chimera states , and which we discuss in a neural context . in ",
    "[ sec : applications ] we briefly review some examples where the mathematics of this review have been applied , and finally in   [ sec : discussion ] we discuss some of the many open challenges in the field of neural network dynamics .",
    "we will assume the reader has familiarity with the following :    * the basics of nonlinear differential equation descriptions of dynamical systems such as linear stability and phase - plane analysis .",
    "* ideas from the qualitative theory of differential equations / dynamical systems such as asymptotic stability , attractors and limit cycles .",
    "* generic codimension - one bifurcation theory of equilibria ( saddle - node , hopf ) and of periodic orbits ( saddle - node of limit cycles , heteroclinic , torus , flip ) .",
    "there are a number of texts that cover this material very well in the context of neuroscience modelling , for example @xcite . at the end",
    "we include a glossary of some abbreviations that are introduced in the text .",
    "nonlinear ionic currents , mediated by voltage - gated ion channels , play a key role in generating membrane potential oscillations and action potentials .",
    "there are many ordinary differential equation ( ode ) models for voltage oscillations , ranging from biophysically detailed conductance - based models through to simple integrate - and - fire ( if ) caricatures .",
    "this style of modelling has also proved fruitful at the population level , for tracking the averaged activity of a near synchronous state . in all these cases bifurcation analysis",
    "is especially useful for classifying the types of oscillatory ( and possibly resonant ) behaviour that are possible .",
    "here we give a brief overview of some of the key oscillator models encountered in computational neuroscience , as well as models for electrical and chemical coupling necessary to build networks .",
    "the work of hodgkin and huxley in elucidating the mechanism of action potentials in the squid giant axon is one of the major breakthroughs of dynamical modelling in physiology @xcite , and see @xcite for a review .",
    "their work underpins all modern electrophysiological models , exploiting the observation that cell membranes behave much like electrical circuits .",
    "the basic circuit elements are 1 ) the phospholipid bilayer , which is analogous to a capacitor in that it accumulates ionic charge as the electrical potential across the membrane changes ; 2 ) the ionic permeabilities of the membrane , which are analogous to resistors in an electronic circuit ; and 3 ) the electrochemical driving forces , which are analogous to batteries driving the ionic currents .",
    "these ionic currents are arranged in a parallel circuit .",
    "thus the electrical behaviour of cells is based upon the transfer and storage of ions such as k@xmath0 and na@xmath0 .",
    "our goal here is to illustrate , by exploiting specific models of excitable membrane , some of the concepts and techniques which can be used to understand , predict , and interpret the excitable and oscillatory behaviours that are commonly observed in single cell electrophysiological recordings .",
    "we begin with the mathematical description of the hodgkin - huxley model .",
    "the standard dynamical system for describing a neuron as a spatially isopotential cell with constant membrane potential @xmath1 is based upon conservation of electric charge , so that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cell capacitance , @xmath4 the applied current and @xmath5 represents the sum of individual ionic currents : @xmath6 in the hodgkin - huxley ( hh ) model the membrane current arises mainly through the conduction of sodium and potassium ions through voltage dependent channels in the membrane .",
    "the contribution from other ionic currents is assumed to obey ohm s law ( and is called the leak current ) .",
    "the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are conductances ( conductance=1/resistance ) .",
    "the great insight of hodgkin and huxley was to realise that @xmath7 depends upon four activation gates : @xmath10 , whereas @xmath8 depends upon three activation gates and one inactivation gate : @xmath11 . here",
    "the gating variables all obey equations of the form @xmath12 the conductance variables described by @xmath13 take values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 and approach the asymptotic values @xmath16 with time constants @xmath17 .",
    "these six functions are obtained from fits with experimental data .",
    "it is common practice to write @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 have the interpretation of opening and closing channel transition rates respectively .",
    "the details of the hh model are provided in appendix a for completeness .",
    "a numerical bifurcation diagram of the model in response to constant current injection is shown in fig .  [ fig : hhbif ] , illustrating that oscillations can emerge in a hopf bifurcation with increasing drive .    .",
    "the green circles show the amplitude of a stable limit cycle and the blue circles indicate unstable limit cycle behaviour .",
    "the solid red line shows the stable fixed point and the black line shows the unstable fixed point .",
    "details of the model are in appendix  a. [ fig : hhbif ] , width=288 ]    the mathematical forms chosen by hodgkin and huxley for the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are all transcendental functions .",
    "both this and the high dimensionality of the model make analysis difficult . however , considerable simplification is attained with the following observations : ( i ) @xmath25 is small for all @xmath1 so that the variable @xmath26 rapidly approaches its equilibrium value @xmath27 , and ( ii ) the equations for @xmath28 and @xmath29 have similar time - courses and may be _ slaved _ together .",
    "this has been put on a more formal footing by abbott and kepler @xcite , to obtain a reduced planar model for @xmath30 obtained from the full hodgkin - huxley model under the replacement @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 with a prescribed choice of @xmath34 .",

    "green for @xmath34 ) of the reduced hh neuron mode , obtained using the reduction technique of abbott and kepler @xcite , for the oscillatory regime ( @xmath35 ) capable of supporting a periodic train of spikes .",
    "the periodic orbit is shown in blue .",
    "[ fig : hhr ] , width=288 ]    for zero external input the fixed point is stable and the neuron is said to be _",
    "excitable_. when a positive external current is applied the low - voltage portion of the @xmath1 nullcline moves up whilst the high - voltage part remains relatively unchanged . for sufficiently large constant external input",
    "the intersection of the two nullclines falls within the portion of the @xmath1 nullcline with positive slope . in this case",
    "the fixed point is unstable and the system may support a limit cycle .",
    "the system is said to be oscillatory as it may produce a train of action potentials .",
    "action potentials may also be induced in the absence of an external current for synaptic stimuli of sufficient strength and duration .",
    "this simple planar model captures all of the essential features of the original hh model yet is much easier to understand from a geometric perspective .",
    "indeed the model is highly reminiscent of the famous fhn model , in which the voltage nullcline is taken to be a cubic function .",
    "both models show the onset of repetitive firing at a non - zero frequency as observed in the hh model ( when an excitable state loses stability via a subcritical hopf bifurcation ) . however , unlike real cortical neurons they can not fire at arbitrarily low frequency .",
    "this brings us to consider modifications of the original hh formalism to accommodate bifurcation mechanisms from excitable to oscillatory behaviours that can respect this experimental observation .",
    "many of the properties of real cortical neurons can be captured by making the equation for the recovery variable of the fhn equations quadratic ( instead of linear ) .",
    "we are thus led to the cortical model of wilson @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is like the membrane potential @xmath1 , and @xmath40 plays the role of a gating variable .",
    "in addition to the single fixed point of the fhn model it is possible to have another pair of fixed points , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : cortical ] , width=384 ]      a snic bifurcation is not the only way to achieve a low firing rate in a single neurone model .",
    "it is also possible to achieve this via a homoclinic bifurcation , as is possible in the morris - lecar ( ml ) model @xcite .",
    "this was originally developed as a model for barnacle muscle fiber .",
    "morris and lecar introduced a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) incorporating two ionic currents : an outward going , non - inactivating potassium current and an inward going , non - inactivating calcium current .",

    "[ fig : ml ] , as @xmath4 decreases the periodic orbit grows in amplitude , it comes closer to a saddle point and slows down such that near the homoclinic bifurcation , where the orbit collides with the saddle at @xmath41 , the frequency of oscillation scales as @xmath60 .     with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "[ fig : ml ] , width=288 ]      although conductance - based models like that of hodgkin and huxley provide a level of detail that helps us to understand how the kinetics of channels ( with averaged activation and inactivation variables ) can underlie action - potential generation their high dimensionality is a barrier to studies at the network level .",
    "the goal of a network - level analysis is to predict emergent computational properties in populations and recurrent networks of neurons from the properties of their component cells .",
    "thus simpler ( lower dimensional and hopefully mathematically tractable ) models are more appealing - especially if they fit single neuron data .",
    "a one - dimensional nonlinear if model takes the form @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is reset to @xmath75 just after reaching the value @xmath76 .",
    "in other words we seek a piecewise discontinuous solution @xmath74 of ( [ eq : one ] ) such that @xmath77 firing times are defined iteratively according to @xmath78 real cortical data can be very accurately fit using : @xmath79 with @xmath80 mv , @xmath81 ms , @xmath82 mv and @xmath83 mv @xcite .",
    "there are many varieties of nonlinear if model , with the quadratic one @xcite being well known as a precursor for the planar izhikevich spiking model @xcite , itself capable of generating a wide variety of firing patterns , including bursting and chattering as well as regular spiking . for a more thorough discussion of if models and the challenges of analysing non - smooth dynamical systems we refer the reader to @xcite .      at a synapse",
    "presynaptic firing results in the release of neurotransmitters that cause a change in the membrane conductance of the postsynaptic neuron .",
    "this postsynaptic current may be written @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the voltage of the postsynaptic neuron , @xmath86 is the membrane reversal potential and @xmath87 is a constant conductance .",
    "the variable @xmath88 corresponds to the probability that a synaptic receptor channel is in an open conducting state .",
    "this probability depends on the presence and concentration of neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic neuron .",
    "the sign of @xmath86 relative to the resting potential ( which without loss of generality we may set to zero ) determines whether the synapse is excitatory ( @xmath89 ) or inhibitory ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the effect of some synapses can be described with a function that fits the shape of the postsynaptic response due to the arrival of action potential at the pre - synaptic release site .",
    "a postsynaptic potential ( psp ) @xmath91 would then be given by @xmath92 , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the arrival time of a pre - synaptic action potential and @xmath95 fits the shape of a realistic psp ( with @xmath96 for @xmath97 ) .",
    "a common ( normalised ) choice for @xmath95 is a difference of exponentials : @xmath98 or the alpha function @xmath99 obtained from ( [ eq : doe ] ) in the limit @xmath100 .",
    "the psp arising from a train of action potentials is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the arrival time of the @xmath26th action potential at a synapse .",
    "interestingly even purely inhibitory synaptic interactions between non - oscillatory neurons can create oscillations at the network level , and can give rise to central pattern generators of  half - center \" type @xcite . to see this we need only consider a pair of ( reduced ) hodgkin - huxley neurons with mutual reciprocal inhibition mediated by an @xmath103-function synapse with a negative reversal potential .",

    "the _ in - degree _ of the node @xmath114 is the number of incoming connections ( i.e. @xmath160 ) , while the _ out - degree _ is the number of outgoing connections ( i.e. @xmath161 ) and the distribution of these degrees is often used to characterise a large graph .",
    "scale - free _ network is a large network where the distribution of in ( or out ) degrees scales as a polynomial .",
    "this can be contrasted with highly structured homogeneous networks ( for example on a lattice ) where the degree may be the same at each node .",
    "other properties commonly examined include the clustering properties and path lengths within the graph .",
    "there are also various measures of centrality that help one to determine the most important nodes in a graph - for example the _ betweenness centrality _ is a measure of centrality that is the probability that a given node is on the shortest path between two uniformly randomly chosen nodes @xcite . as expected , the more central nodes are typically most important if one wishes to achieve synchrony in a network .",
    "other basic topological properties of networks that are relevant to their dynamics include , for example , the following , most of which are mentioned in @xcite : the network is _ undirected _ if @xmath162 for all @xmath163 , otherwise it is _",
    "directed_. we say nodes @xmath115 and @xmath114 in the network @xmath156 are _ path - connected _ if for some @xmath29 there is a path from @xmath115 to @xmath114 , i.e. @xmath164 for some @xmath29 .",
    "the network is _ strongly connected _",
    "if for each @xmath163 is path connected in both directions while it is _ weakly connected _ if we replace @xmath156 by @xmath165 ( i.e. we make the network undirected ) and the latter network is strongly connected .",
    "n.b . there may be some confusion in that strong and weak connectivity are properties of a directed network - while strong and weak coupling are properties of the coupling strengths for a given network !",
    "the _ diameter _ of a network is the maximal length of a shortest path between two points on varying the endpoints .",
    "other properties of the adjacency matrix are discussed for example in @xcite where spectral properties of graph laplacians are linked to the problem of determining stability of synchronised states .",

    "the cause of the stretching and folding is the variation in how far points @xmath284 are moved by @xmath261 in the direction transverse to the isochrons ( i.e. the ordering of points in terms of asymptotic phase is altered by the action of the kick ) .",
    "lin and young @xcite emphasise that the occurrence of shear induced chaos depends on the interplay between the geometries of the kicks and the dynamical structures of the unforced system .    in the case of the linear shear model above ,",

    "however , it is well to note that not much is known about nonlinear systems with three or more interacting frequencies @xcite , as opposed to periodically forced systems where the notions of farey tree and the devil s staircase have proven especially useful .",
    "we have also painted the notion of synchrony with a broad mathematical brush , and not discussed more subtle notions of envelope locking that may arise between coupled bursting neurons ( where the within burst patterns may desynchronise ) @xcite .",
    "this is especially relevant to studies of synchronised bursting @xcite and the emergence of chaotic phenomena @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have said very little about coupling between systems that are chaotic , such as described in @xcite , the emergence of chaos in networks @xcite or chaos in symmetric networks @xcite .",
    "the issue of chaos is also relevant to notions of reliability , where one is interested in the stability of spike trains against fluctuations .",
    "this has often been discussed in relation to stochastic oscillator forcing rather than those arising deterministically in a high dimensional setting @xcite .",
    "of course , given the sparsity of firing in cortex means that it may not even be appropriate to treat neurons as oscillators .",
    "however , some of the ideas developed for oscillators can be extended to excitable systems , as described in @xcite . as well as this",
    "it is important to point out that neurons are not point processors , and have an extensive dendritic tree , which can also contribute significantly to emergent rhythms as described in @xcite , as well as couple strongly to glial cells .",
    "although the latter do not fire spikes , they do show oscillations of membrane potential @xcite . at the macroscopic level it is also important to acknowledge that the amplitude of different brain waves can also be significantly affected by neuromodulation @xcite ,",
    "say through release of norepinephrine , serotonin and acetylcholine , and the latter is also thought to be able to modulate the prc of a single neuron @xcite .",
    "this review has focused mainly on the embedding of weakly coupled oscillator theory within a slightly wider framework .",
    "this is useful in setting out some of the neuroscience driven challenges for the mathematical community in establishing inroads into a more general theory of coupled oscillators .",
    "heterogeneity is one issue that we have mainly side - stepped , and remember that the weakly coupled oscillator approach requires frequencies of individual oscillators to be close .",
    "this can have a strong effect on emergent network dynamics @xcite , and it is highly likely that even a theory with heterogeneous phase response curves @xcite will have little bearing on real networks . the _ equation - free _ coarse - graining approach may have merit in this regard , though is a numerically intensive technique @xcite .",
    "we suggest a good project for the future is to develop a theory of strongly coupled heterogeneous networks based upon the phase - amplitude coordinate system described in   [ subsec : phase - amplitude ] , with the challenge to develop a reduced network description in terms of a set of phase - amplitude interaction functions , and an emphasis on understanding the new and generic phenomena associated with nontrivial amplitude dynamics ( such as clustered phase - amplitude chaos and multiple attractors ) . to achieve this",
    "one might further tap into recent ideas for classifying emergent dynamics based upon the group of structural symmetries of the network .",
    "this can be computed as the group of automorphisms for the graph describing the network . for many real - world networks",
    ", this can be decomposed into direct and wreath products of symmetric groups @xcite .",
    "this would allow the use of tools from computational group theory @xcite to be used , and open up a way to classify the generic forms of behaviour that a given network may exhibit using the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory .",
