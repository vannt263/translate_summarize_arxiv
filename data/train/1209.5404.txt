    "recently , holography involving higher spin gauge theories has received a lot of attention .",
    "higher spin gauge theories are believed to be related to the tensionless limit of superstring theory , and indeed higher spin holography may be seen as a simplified , but non - trivial , version of ads / cft duality in superstring theory .",
    "a famous example is the proposal by klebanov and polyakov in @xcite which says that a 4 dimensional higher spin gauge theory is dual to the large @xmath2 limit of the o@xmath14 vector model .",
    "two years ago it was conjectured in @xcite that a 3 dimensional higher spin gauge theory is dual to a large @xmath2 minimal model , see @xcite for a review .",
    "there are several generalizations of this duality ; a truncated version was considered in @xcite , and the full @xmath4 supersymmetric version was introduced in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we would like to propose and test the @xmath0 supersymmetric version of the duality .",
    "the higher spin gauge theories appearing in these dualities are truncated versions of the @xmath4 supergravity by prokushkin and vasiliev @xcite .",

    "the supergravity includes both bosonic and fermionic higher spin gauge fields and also massive scalars and fermions , as in the untruncated case .",
    "our proposal is that the dual cft is given by the @xmath3 super coset @xmath25 there is no enhancement of supersymmetry from @xmath0 to @xmath4 since this coset does not satisfy the condition in @xcite superconformal symmetry is that the coset manifold @xmath26 is a hermitian symmetric space .",

    "the generic field content of a coset algebra can under certain circumstances be computed using classical invariant theory @xcite .",
    "the coset , we are interested in , is of this favourable type . as mentioned before , the coset algebra is the commutant subalgebra @xmath309 the algebra @xmath310 is generated as a conformal field theory by the fields @xmath288 generating the @xmath311 subalgebra of @xmath312 , the fields @xmath313 which are primaries in the vector representation of @xmath311 , and the fermions @xmath276 .",

    "note , that these fields are multiplets of the @xmath263 super algebra as @xmath323 . the second fundamental theorem of invariant theory for the orthogonal group @xcite states that all relations between invariants either involve a determinant of a matrix whose columns are vectors or they are determinants of @xmath324 matrices whose entries are traces .",
    "all these relations concern invariants whose spin is at least @xmath2 which implies that the spin content of the coset algebra agrees with the proposed higher spin supergravity in the large @xmath2 limit .",

    "in this work , we propose that the @xmath263 truncation of prokushkin and vasiliev s @xmath31 higher spin supergravity on ads@xmath1 @xcite is dual to a limit of a family of conformal field theories given by the @xmath3 super cosets @xmath325 we need to take the large @xmath2 limit with t hooft parameter @xmath326 kept finite .",

    "it often happens that seemingly very different cosets possess the same symmetry algebra .",
    "we would like to remark that there are other cosets whose spin content of the symmetry algebra seems to coincide with the one of the coset of the present work .",

    "the symmetry algebra of the cosets @xmath336 can be studied as before in the large @xmath20 limit and again seems to have the same spin content .",
    "conformal field theories of supercosets are usually not unitary and hence we expect a tentative dual higher spin supergravity to be less interesting .",
    "further work is needed to obtain a better understanding of the duality . in order to compare the partition functions",
    ", we assumed that some states in the cft decouple from the others in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "it is thus necessary to examine whether this assumption is true or not .",
    "also , it would be desirable to show that the asymptotic symmetry of the @xmath0 supergravity can be reproduced by the t hooft limit of the @xmath3 super coset , in particular one should also study the hamiltonian reduction of the @xmath337 affine lie algebra .",
