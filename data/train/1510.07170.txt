    "smart meters are a critical part of modern power distribution systems because they provide fine - grained power consumption measurements to utility providers .",
    "these fine - grained measurements improve the efficiency of the power grid by enabling services such as time - of - use pricing and demand response  @xcite . however , this promise of improved efficiency is accompanied by a risk of privacy loss .",
    "it is possible for the utility provider  or an eavesdropper  to infer private information including load taxonomy from the fine - grained measurements provided by smart meters  @xcite .",
    "such private information could be exploited by third parties for the purpose of targeted advertisement or surveillance .",
    "traditional techniques in which an intermediary anonymizes the data  @xcite are also prone privacy loss to an eavesdropper .",
    "one possible solution is to partially obscure the load profile by using a rechargeable battery  @xcite . as the cost of rechargeable batteries decreases ( for example , due to proliferation of electric vehicles ) , using them for improving privacy is becoming economically viable .",
    "in a smart metering system with a rechargeable battery , the energy consumed from the power grid may either be less than the user s demand  the rest being supplied by the battery ; or may be more than the user s demand  the excess being stored in the battery .",
    "a rechargeable battery provides privacy because the power consumed from the grid ( rather than the user s demand ) gets reported to the electricity utility ( and potentially observed by an eavesdropper ) . in this paper , we focus on the mutual information between the user s demand and consumption ( i.e. , the information leakage ) as the privacy metric .",
    "mutual information is a widely used metric in the literature on information theoretic security , as it is often analytically tractable and provides a fundamental bound on the probability of detecting the true load sequence from the observation  @xcite .",
    "our objective is to identify a battery management policy ( which determine how much energy to store or discharge from the battery ) to minimize the information leakage rate .",
    "we briefly review the relevant literature .",
    "the use of a rechargeable battery for providing user privacy has been studied in several recent works , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "most of the existing literature has focused on evaluating the information leakage rate of specific battery management policies .",
    "these include the `` best - effort '' policy  @xcite , which tries to maintain a constant consumption level , whenever possible ; and battery conditioned stochastic charging policies  @xcite , in which the conditional distribution on the current consumption depends only on the current battery state ( or on the current battery state and the current demand ) . in  @xcite",
    ", the information leakage rate was estimated using monte - carlo simulations ; in  @xcite , it was calculated using the bcjr algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the methodology of  @xcite was extended by  @xcite to include models with energy harvesting and allowing for a certain amount of energy waste .",
    "bounds on the performance of the best - effort policy and hide - and - store policy for models with energy harvesting and infinite battery capacity were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the performance of the best effort algorithm for an individual privacy metric was considered in  @xcite .",
    "none of these papers address the question of choosing the optimal battery management policy .",
    "rate - distortion type approaches have also been used to study privacy - utility trade - off  @xcite .",
    "these models allow the user to report a distorted version of the load to the utility provider , subject to a certain average distortion constraint .",
    "our setup differs from these works as we impose a constraint on the _ instantaneous _ energy stored in the battery due to its limited capacity .",
    "both our techniques and the qualitative nature of the results are different from these papers .",
    "our contributions are two - fold .",
    "first , when the demand is markov , we show that the minimum information leakage rate and optimal battery management policies can be obtained by solving an appropriate dynamic program .",
    "these results are similar in spirit to the dynamic programs obtained to compute capacity of channels with memory  @xcite ; however , the specific details are different due to the constraint on the battery state .",
    "second , when the demand is i.i.d .",
    ", we obtain a single letter characterization of the minimum information leakage rate ; this expression also gives the optimal battery management policy .",
    "we prove the single letter expression in two steps . on the achievability side",
    "we propose a class of policies with a specific structure that enables a considerable simplification of the leakage - rate expression .",
    "we find a policy that minimizes the leakage - rate within this restricted class . on the converse side ,",
    "we obtain lower bounds on the minimal leakage rate and show that these lower bound match the performance of the best structured policy .",
    "we provide two proofs .",
    "one is based on the dynamic program and the other is based purely on information theoretic arguments .    after the present work was completed , we became aware of  @xcite , where a similar dynamic programming framework is presented for the infinite horizon case .",
    "however , no explicit solutions of the dynamic program are derived in  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
