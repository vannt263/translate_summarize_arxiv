    "the effects of propagating waves on the statistical properties of systems out of equilibrium remain an important topic of discussion . in the context of a coupled spin model in one - dimension",
    "@xmath3@xcite it has been shown that the presence of such waves leads to weak dynamic scaling in that model .",
    "in contrast , in a coupled burgers - like model in @xmath4 propagating waves do not affect the scaling properties of the correlation functions at all @xcite .",
    "so far such issues have been considered only within very simplified one - dimensional nonequilibrium models @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( @xmath0mhd ) turbulence , which is a hydrodynamic description of the coupled evolution of the velocity fields @xmath5 and the magnetic fields @xmath6 in a quasi - neutral plasma , stands as a very good candidate for a natural system with propagating waves in three dimensions as most of its natural realizations have proagating alfvn waves arising due to the presence of mean magnetic fields .",
    "examples of such physical situations include solar wind , neutral plasma in fusion confinement devices etc .",
    "the presence of the propagating alfvn modes , in addition to the usual dissipative modes due to the fluid and magnetic viscosities makes mhd turbulence a good natural example to study the interplay between the propagating and the dissipative modes in a system and their combined effects on the scaling properties of the correlation and structure functions , which are important issues from the point of view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the scaling of magnetic- [ @xmath7 and kinetic- [ @xmath8 energy spectra in the inertial range ( i.e. , wavevector @xmath9 lies in the region @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the integral scale given by the system size and the dissipation scale , respectively ) in @xmath0mhd in the presence of alfvn waves originating due to a mean magnetic field @xmath13 remains controversial till the date .",
    "numerical simulations , due to the lack of sufficient resolutions failed to conclusively distinguish between the kolmogorov s and kraichnan s predictions ( see below ) . in this communication , within one - loop self - consistent mode - coupling ( scmc ) approximations , we obtain the following results for homogeneous but anisotropic ( due to the mean magnetic field ) @xmath0mhd :    * the bare alfvn wave speed , proportional to @xmath14 , renormalizes to acquire a singular @xmath9-dependence to become @xmath15 where @xmath9 is a fourier wavevector belonging to the inertial ( scaling ) range . from this result we are able to conclude that _ even _ in the presence of a mean magnetic field the kinetic- and the magnetic- energy spectra scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range , identical with the situation without any mean magnetic field . *",
    "the dimensionless kolmogorov s constants for the kinetic- and magnetic - energy spectra depends on a dimensionless parameter @xmath16 which we identify as the ratio of the renormalised alfvn wave speed and the renormalised viscosities ( see below ) . *",
    "the intermittency exponents of the elssser fields @xmath17 which approximately and qualitatively characterise the multiscaling properties of the structure functions in a log - normal model depend on the parameter @xmath16 and decrease with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "thus our results show that alfvn waves in @xmath0mhd do not affect the scaling properties of the two - point correlation functions .",
    "however , the multiscaling properties of the structure functions are shown to be affected by the mean magnetic fields .",
    "the famous kolmogorov s arguments @xcite for fluid turbulence can be easily extended to @xmath0mhd turbulence . in mhd , in the unit where mass density @xmath18 , the kinetic energy dissipation rate per unit mass ( @xmath19 ) and the magnetic energy dissipation rate per unit mass ( @xmath20 ) have same physical dimensions .",
    "thus , as in fluid turbulence , by claiming that the structure functions of the velocity and magnetic field differences in the inertial range must be constructed out of the mean energy dissipation rate @xmath21 per unit mass and the local length scale @xmath22 ( belonging to the inertial range ) one obtains for the @xmath23-th order structure function @xcite @xmath24\\hat r_i]^n\\rangle \\sim ( \\epsilon r)^{n/3},\\;\\;\\eta_d\\ll r\\ll l\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the velocity and the magnetic fields , @xmath12 is the ( small ) dissipation scale and @xmath11 is the ( large ) system size .",
    "this yields , for the energy spectra in the inertial range ( as a function of wavevector @xmath9 ) @xmath27 this is known as the k41 theory in the relevant literature . however , in the presence of a mean magnetic field @xmath13 , the alfvn waves are generated ( see below ) with the propagation speed @xmath28 .",
    "thus in such a case in addition to the usual kolmogorov time scale @xmath29 @xcite , there exists another time scale constructed out of the mean magnetic field @xmath14 , known as the kraichnan time scale @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "kraichnan argued that this time scale would determine the energy cascade process and hence would enter in the expression of the structure function yielding @xmath31 .",
    "there has not been any satisfactory resolution of this issue till this date ; due to the particularly difficult vectorial nature of the @xmath0mhd equations ( see below ) it is rather difficult to achieve high reynolds number in direct numerical solutions ( dns ) of the @xmath0mhd equations .",
    "numerical solutions of an mhd shell - model in the presence of a small mean magnetic field - like term did not find any dependence of the multiscaling of the structure functions on the mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "analytically , it has been shown within the context of a @xmath32 coupled burgers - like model @xcite that the energy spectra are independent of a mean magnetic field and in case of @xmath32 mhd turbulence it exhibits the kolmogorov scaling for the energy spectra .",
    "similar conclusions followed from an analogous one - dimensional model @xcite . various phenomenological approaches , including weak turbulence theories and three - wave interaction models , yield , in general , mean magnetic field dependences of the energy spectra @xcite when the mean magnetic field is strong",
    "however , these theories , despite their predictions are either not directly derivable from the underlying @xmath0mhd eqs . of motion or involve additional assumptions on the flow fields .",
    "analyses starting from the @xmath0mhd eqs . in this regard are still lacking .",
    "most observational results on astrophysical systems seem to favour the k41 results @xcite .",
    "simulations of incompressible mhd @xcite find results close to the k41 result . simulations of compressible mhd @xcite , even though in some cases find energy spectra closer to k41 , in general yields a less clear picture .",
    "recent numerical results of mller _ et al _ @xcite suggest that in presence of finite magnetic helicity structure functions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic fields are affected differently by the mean magnetic field . in this paper",
    ", we address some of these issues by starting from the @xmath0mhd eqs . without making any further assumptions on the velocity and the magnetic fields , except for the validity of the perturbative approaches .",
    "in particular , we show by applying one - loop mode coupling methods on the @xmath0mhd equations with a mean magnetic field and in the absence of any magnetic helicity that the one - dimensional energy spectra in @xmath0mhd turbulence are independent of the mean magnetic field @xmath13 and scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range where @xmath2 is a fourier wavevector belonging to the inertial range .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the kolmogorov s constants for the kinetic- and the magnetic - energy spectra and show that they depend on @xmath14 .",
    "lastly , we calculate the intermittency exponents for the velocity and the magnetic fields and find that they decrease with increasing @xmath14",
    ". we do not distinguish between the longitudinal and the transverse structure functions . even though for analytical convenience we assume a weak mean magnetic field , we are able to obtain new and interesting results concerning scaling and multiscaling in @xmath0mhd in the presence of a mean magnetic field of small magnitude . in this respect",
    "our results can be considered as complementary to some of the existing results @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in sec.[model ] we discuss the @xmath0mhd equations for incompressible fluids . in sec.[incom ] we show that for incompressible fluids the bare alfvn wave speed @xmath28 renormalizes to pick a correction @xmath33 in the inertial range .",
    "this , as we argue , implies that the energy spectra scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range _ even _ in the presence of a mean magnetic field . in sec.[kolcons ] we calculate the kolmogorov s constants for the kinetic and the magnetic energy spectra .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath16 which is the dimensionless ratio of the renormalised mean magnetic field and renormalised viscosities and show that the kolmogorov s constants depend on @xmath16 . in sec.[inter ] we elucidate the multiscaling properties of the structure functions by calculating the intermittency exponents and show that they decrease with increasing @xmath16 , i.e. , with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "this suggests that a mean magnetic field tends to reduce multiscaling corrections to the k41 results for the structure functions . in sec.[conclu ] we summarize our results .",
    "we begin by writing down the @xmath0mhd equations for the velocity fields @xmath5 and the magnetic fields @xmath6 : the velocity field @xmath5 is governed by the navier - stokes equation modified by the inclusion of the lorentz force @xcite @xmath34 and the dynamics of the magnetic field @xmath6 is governed by the induction equation @xcite constructed out of the ohm s law for a moving frame and the ampere s law : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the mass density , @xmath37 is the pressure , @xmath38 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath39 is the magnetic viscosity ( inversely proportional to the electrical conductivity of the fluid medium concerned )",
    ". functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are external forces needed to maintain a statistical steady state . in the present approach",
    "these are taken to be stochastic forces .",
    "we assume them to be zero - mean and gaussian distributed with specified variances ( see below ) .",
    "in addition to eqs .",
    "( [ mhdvcom ] ) and ( [ mhdb ] ) we also have @xmath42 ( maxwell s equation ) and , for incompressible fluids @xmath43 .    if the magnetic fields @xmath44 are such that @xmath45 ( a constant vector ) then replacing @xmath6 by @xmath46 where now @xmath47 , in eqs .",
    "( [ mhdvcom ] ) and ( [ mhdb ] ) one obtains additional linear terms proportional to wavevector @xmath2 leading to wave - like excitations , known as alfvn waves .",
    "the resulting equations are @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 are kept for book keeping purposes and can be set to unity ( see sec.[symm ] ) .",
    "note that on dropping the nonlinear and the dissipative terms from eqs .",
    "( [ mhdfullv ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb ] ) the resulting linear coupled partial differential equations admit wave - like solutions with dispersion relation linear in wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "these are known as the alfvn waves @xcite in the literature which propagate with speed proportional to @xmath14 . in the following sections we would calculate the kinetic and the magnetic energy spectra , the kolmogorov s constants and the intermittency exponents in the presence of the alfvn waves , i.e. , for @xmath52 .",
    "in the statistical steady state the time dependent correlation functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 exhibit scaling which are characterized by the roughness exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , and the dynamic exponent @xmath55 . in terms of the scaling exponents @xmath56 and @xmath55 the velocity and the magnetic field correlators have the form ( as a function of wavevector @xmath2 and frequency @xmath57 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are scaling functions , @xmath61 is the transverse projection operator : @xmath62 to account for the incompressibility of the fields .",
    "the kinetic- and magnetic - energy are simply related to the correlation functions : they are just the equal time velocity and magnetic field auto correlation functions multiplied by appropriate phasefactors .",
    "we now set out to find whether the alfvn waves are relevant perturbations on the system .",
    "it should be noted that the correlators ( [ corrform ] ) are chosen as they would be in the fully isotropic case . in the presence of a mean magnetic field @xmath13",
    "there would however be additional anisotropic terms in the expression for the correlators above . in the small @xmath13 limit the lowest order corrections to the expressions ( [ corrform ] ) are @xmath63 .",
    "neglecting these correction terms does not affect our scaling analyses below , and in any case , we are interested to see whether anisotropic alfvn waves are relevant perturbations in the large scale , long time limit on the isotropic @xmath0mhd as characterised by expressions ( [ corrform ] ) .",
    "therefore , it suffices for us to work with the expressions ( [ corrform ] ) for our mode - coupling analyses below .",
    "a complete characterisation of the nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) of mhd , however , requires informations about , not just the scaling of the energy - spectra , but also of the @xmath23-th order equal time structure functions of the velocity and the magnetic fields in the inertial range .",
    "these are defined by @xmath64\\hat r_i|^n\\rangle , \\;\\;a = u , b,\\,\\eta_d\\ll r\\ll l , \\label{defstru}\\ ] ] which scale as @xmath65 where @xmath22 belongs to the inertial range ( @xmath66 ) . according to the kolmogorov theory ( k41 ) the multiscaling exponents @xmath67 ; i.e. , they are linear in @xmath23 .",
    "subsequent numerical and observational results for homogeneous and isotropic @xmath0mhd , i.e. , without any mean magnetic fields , @xcite suggested deviations from the k41 results which are similar to those of pure fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "much less results for the multiscaling of the structure functions are available when there are mean magnetic fields .",
    "recent numerical simulations of mller _ et al _ @xcite suggested that structure functions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic fields are differently affected by it when there is a finite magnetic helicity .",
    "below we investigate the issue of multiscaling in presence of a mean magnetic field @xmath13 within the context of a log - normal model by evaluating the relevant intermittency exponents which are found to depend explicitly on @xmath14 . in our analyses we ignore the distinction between the structure functions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the mean magnetic field ; nevertheless , as we discuss below , our results are significantly new .",
    "we begin by re - expressing @xmath0mhd eqs .",
    "( [ mhdvcom ] ) and ( [ mhdb ] ) by writing the magnetic fields @xmath6 as a sum of a space - time dependent part and a constant vector : @xmath68 . in terms of these fields and parameters , the @xmath0mhd eqs .",
    "become @xmath69 and @xmath70 it should be noted that in eqs .",
    "( [ mhdfullv1 ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb1 ] ) @xmath71 is _ not _ the mean magnetic field in general ; it would be so only if @xmath72 is zero in eqs .",
    "( [ mhdfullv1 ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb1 ] ) .",
    "note that our above way of splitting the magnetic fields fields does not change the actual mean magnetic field in the system : it is still given by @xmath73 .",
    "the eqs . of motion ( [ mhdfullv1 ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb1 ] ) are invariant under the following continuous transformations @xcite :    * the galilean transformation ( ti ) : @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite with @xmath76 in eqs . ( [ mhdfullv ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb ] ) .",
    "this implies non - renormalization of @xmath77 @xcite . * the transformation ( tii )",
    "@xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "this allows one to work with the _ effective _ magnetic fields defined by @xmath81 such that the coefficient of the lorentz force vertex constructed out of the effective magnetic fields does not renormalize .",
    "this , therefore , ensures @xmath82 can be set to unity @xcite by treating all magnetic fields as _ effective fields_. here the shift @xmath83 is a vector . a transformation similar to tii above exists in a problem of passive scalar turbulence @xcite .",
    "the transformation tii essentially signifies the freedom to split the total magnetic fields as a sum of a constant part and a space time dependent part .",
    "it should be noted that the transformation tii keeps the mean magnetic field unchanged .",
    "in fact , nonrenormalization of @xmath82 can be shown in a simpler way : let us assume that under mode eliminations and rescaling @xmath84 .",
    "this scale factor of @xmath85 can now be absorbed by redefining the units of the magnetic fields by @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 can be set to unity if all magnetic fields are considered as _ effective _ or rescaled magnetic fields . since the induction eq .",
    "( [ mhdb ] is linear in the magnetic fields @xmath87 , such rescaling leaves every conclusion unchanged .",
    "of course , the external force @xmath41 is also scaled by a factor @xmath88 which does not affect out analysis here as the assignment of canonical dimensions to various fields and parameters is done after absorbing @xmath82 in the definition of @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically under the rescaling @xmath89 the bare parameters scale as @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "since there are no fluctuation corrections to the nonlinearities @xmath51 , which are the consequences of the invariances under the transformations ti and tii , they can be kept invariant under rescaling of space and time as mentioned above leading to @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "thus , under naive rescaling the bare parameter @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , the invariance under the transformation tii and the resulting ward identity ensure that different ways of implementing one - loop rg by having different values for @xmath95 and @xmath96 in eqs .",
    "( [ mhdfullv1 ] ) and ( [ mhdfullb1 ] ) subject to the same bare mean magnetic field @xmath97 .",
    "since any renormalisation scheme must respect a freedom of choice as represented by the transformation tii , respective terms must scale the same way under the rescaling of space and time @xcite .",
    "hence , due to fluctuation corrections @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , since both @xmath96 and @xmath6 have the same scaling dimensions given by the exponent @xmath99 , the physical mean magnetic field in the system @xmath100 , if it receives fluctuation corrections under mode eliminations , must scale as @xmath101 , or if there are no fluctuation corrections to it due to some special symmetries ( as in the one - dimensional burgers - like model for mhd in ref.@xcite ) will be irrelevant ( in an rg ) sense as it will flow to zero as @xmath102 ( since @xmath55 for fully developed turbulence is less than unity ) .",
    "this clearly suggests the possibility of a renormalisation of the alfvn wave speed , akin to the renormalisation of the sound speed in compressible fluid turbulence @xcite . as we will see below , for @xmath0mhd there are infra - red singular fluctuation corrections to the bare mean magnetic field leading it to renormalise in a way consistent with our predictions from the ward identities above .",
    "it should be noted that our analyses above is independent of the strength of the bare value of the mean magnetic field .",
    "although , in the discussion above we have rescaled space isotropically ( i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath55 coordinates are rescaled the same way ) and analyze the scale dependence of the resulting effective parameters and the fields , it should be noted that such a rescaling does not imply that the effective parameters have isotropic structures .",
    "we begin by writing down the @xmath0mhd equations in the incompressible limit ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "we write down the equations of motion in @xmath2-space in terms of the elssser variables @xmath104 .",
    "the equations are ( we take the mean magnetic field @xmath13 to be along the @xmath105 direction ) @xmath106 the stochastic forces @xmath107 are linear combinations of @xmath108 , the tensor @xmath109 is the transverse projection operator which appears due to the divergence - free conditions on @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath110 .    in the absence of any crosscorrelations between the velocity and the magnetic fields , the simplest choice for the noise variances , consistent with the divergence - free conditions on the velocity and the magnetic fields , are @xmath111 in eqs.([noisecor ] ) we choose @xmath112 .",
    "in particular , the choice of @xmath113 in @xmath114-space dimensions ensures that the energy flux in the inertial range is a constant ( up to a weak logarithmic dependence on wavevector @xmath9 ) which forms the basis of the k41 theory @xcite , and as a result , the parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 pick up dimensions of energy dissipation rate per unit mass .",
    "hence , we will use @xmath113 in our calculations below . in experimental realisations of mhd ,",
    "external forces act on the large scales . in analytical approaches ,",
    "such forces are replaced by stochastic forces with variances given by eqs .",
    "( [ noisecor ] ) for calculational convenience .",
    "it should however be noted that in numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equation driven by stochastic forces with variances similar to eqs .",
    "( [ noisecor ] ) structure functions of the velocity fields are shown to exhibit multiscaling similar to the experimental results @xcite .",
    "our preliminary results from the numerical solutions of the isotropic @xmath0mhd equations ( i.e. , no mean magnetic fields ) yield multiscaling similar to those obtained from the @xmath0mhd eqs . driven by large - scale forces @xcite .",
    "although no such numerical results exist for the case with a mean magnetic field , it will presumably be true for such a situation also . in a stochastically driven langevin description ,",
    "correlation functions are proportional to the noise correlations and hence it is necessary to force the induction eq .",
    "( [ mhdfullb ] ) stochastically , as is common in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . for such noises in the absence of any mean magnetic field ( i.e. , for the isotropic case )",

    "thus the one - dimensional kinetic- and the magnetic - energy spectra ( which are simply related to the correlators defined in eqs .",
    "( [ corrdef ] ) ) scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range .",
    "the emerging physical picture is as follows : we find from the expression for @xmath153 above that this , as a function of frequency @xmath57 , has maxima at @xmath157 and the width at half - maxima @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast , the auto correlations of @xmath158 are maximum at @xmath127 and their widths scale as @xmath29 . thus in the long wavelength limit the width and the location of the maxima of @xmath153 scale in the same way leading to the presence of the underdamped alfvn waves in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , it immediately follows that the kinetic- and the magnetic - energy spectra , being linear combinations of the correlators discussed above times appropriate phase factors , scale as @xmath1 _ even _ in the presence of a non - zero mean magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that we have used a small @xmath16 approximation to arrive at our results for the self - consistent amplitude relations . for",

    "however , based on our calculations above , the exponent identity @xmath93 and the ward identity suggesting that the renormalised alfvn wave speed should scale as @xmath33 with wavevector @xmath9 being in the inertial range , we argue that _ even _ for a finite @xmath16 , i.e. , a finite mean magnetic field the energy spectra will scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range , a result supported by many observational evidences @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent amplitude equations will then be anisotropic reflecting the presence of underdamped alfvn waves in the inertial range",
    ". the full correlation matrix will be anisotropic in the hydrodynamic limit ; its eigenvalues have different amplitudes , but all of them scale the same way . our confidence on our result that the scaling of the correlation functions along directions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the mean magnetic field is same is derived from the fact that our exponent values @xmath142 satisfy the one - loop integral equations regardless of the strength of the mean magnetic field and are consistent with the ward identity discussed above .",

    "i.e. , for no magnetic fields , we find @xmath173 for pure fluid turbulence which is well - within the accepted range of values @xcite . before closing this sec .",
    "we would like to point out that the presence of multiscaling raises questions about kolmogorov s constant @xmath174 being universal : a small but finite intermittency correction ( i.e. , multiscaling ) over the simple k41 scaling implies the presence of an _ arbitrary _ scale which may spoil the universality of @xmath174 .",
    "we however refrain ourselves from getting into this question and adopt a point of view that regardless of whether or not @xmath174 remains universal due to multiscaling , the numerical value of this constant is likely to get affected by the presence of alfvn waves in the system which is reflected by the expression ( [ kolm ] ) .",

    ", no controlled perturbative calculation for @xmath176 is available . to account for multiscaling in fluid turbulence , however , obukhov @xcite and kolmogorov @xcite assumed a log - normal distribution for dissipation @xmath21 to arrive at @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the mean value of @xmath21 and ( a bound for @xmath21 in fluid turbulence has been discussed in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath179 for small @xmath180 , @xmath181 . a standard calculation on the randomly stirred model yields _ intermittency exponent _",
    "@xcite where @xmath183 , whereas the best possible estimate from experiments is 0.23 @xcite .",
    "this model , despite having well - known limitations and difficulties @xcite , serves as a qualitative illustration of multiscaling . as in fluid turbulence , in mhd the dissipations @xmath184 of the elssser variables @xmath168",
    "fluctuate in space and time , and as a result one may define two intermittency exponents @xmath185 for them . in the present problem @xmath186 .",
    "below we calculate the exponent @xmath187 in a one - loop expression which will give us an estimate of the alfvn wave speed - dependent deviation of the scaling of the structure functions from their simple - scaling values as predicted by the k41 theory .",
    "we closely follow ref.@xcite .",
    "we work with the self - consistent forms for the self - energies and correlation functions given above along with the consistency relations for the amplitude - ratios @xmath188 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we find the dissipation correlation functions in @xmath0 to be @xmath189 with @xmath85 being defined by the relation @xmath190 . from the self - consistent amplitude - relations ( [ ampli1 ] ) we find @xmath191^{1/3}\\left[1 - 0.5\\gamma -4\\beta^2(0.7 - 0.03\\gamma)\\right]^{1/3}. \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath85 which is a universal coefficient in ordinary fluid turbulence ,",

    "thus we find that a decrease in the value of @xmath83 with an increase in @xmath16 , i.e. , with increasing mean magnetic field . despite the limited applicabilities of log - normal models in characterising multiscaling",
    ", we can conclude , from our expression ( [ delta ] ) for the intermittency exponent in mhd in the presence of a mean magnetic field , that the intermittency corrections to the simple k41 scaling is likely to get affected ( reduced in our calculations ) in the presence of alfvn waves .",
    "further calculations and/or numerical simulations are needed to find the exact extent of the dependence of multiscaling on the mean magnetic field and the possibilities of anisotropic multiscaling for the structure functions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field as demonstrated recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our conclusions on the multiscaling properties of the structure functions depend on a log - normal model for @xmath0mhd . such a description , unfortunately",
    ", is unable to distinguish between the structure functions parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the mean magnetic field in the system .",
    "moreover , the intermittency exponents above [ expressions ( [ delta ] ) ] are evaluated in the lowest order in mean magnetic field .",
    "therefore , even though from our results we are not able to make firm comments on the possibility of parallel and perpendicular structure functions exhibiting different multiscaling , the real importance of our results lie in their elucidation of the multiscaling properties depending on the mean magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we have considered the effects of the alfvn waves on the statistical properties of the correlation functions of the velocity and the magnetic fields or the elssser fields .",
    "we considered the case when the velocity fields are incompressible . in a one - loop approximation",
    "we find that the _ effective _ or the renormalised alfvn wave speed scales as @xmath33 where the wavevector @xmath9 is in the inertial range .",
    "this immediately yields that the energy spectra , even in the presence of a mean magnetic field , scale as @xmath1 in the inertial range .",
    "we identify a dimensionless parameter @xmath16 which is the ratio of the effective alfvn wave speed and the renormalised viscosity .",
    "we obtain self - consistent relations between the amplitude ratio @xmath193 of the correlation functions and @xmath16 .",
    "these relations allow us to calculate the dimensionless kolmogorov s constant and we show that it depends explicitly on @xmath16 or on the mean magnetic field .",
    "finally , we calculate the intermittency exponent which in a log - normal model gives a qualitative account of the multiscaling in terms of the deviation from the k41 scaling for the structure functions .",
    "we would like to emphasize that although the one - dimensional burgers - like model of mhd of ref.@xcite and the @xmath0mhd eqs .",
    "yield energy spectra independent of the alfvn waves , the long wavelength physical pictures are different . in the former case , due to the nonrenormalization of the bare alfvn wave speed",
    ", alfvn waves are overdamped in the hydrodynamic limit ; the dominant process in that limit is viscous dissipation .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath0mhd , the alfvn wave speed picks up a singular correction in the hydrodynamic limit leading to the k41 scaling of the energy spectra and the presence of underdamped alfvn waves in the hydrodynamic limit . despite similar mathematical structures these crucial differences",
    "arise principally because the one - dimensional model decouples completely when written in terms of the elssser variables , allowing to comove with the waves of each of them separately . as a result correlators of each of them",
    "are independent of the alfvn waves and the bare alfvn wave speed remains unrenormalised leading to overdamped alfvn waves in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "however , the @xmath0mhd equations do not decouple when written in terms of the elssser variables and hence oppositely propagating waves can not be made to vanish by comoving . despite the limitations of the one - loop methods @xcite and the small @xmath16 approximation to facilitate easier analytical manipulations for the amplitude relations , we obtain results which are significantly new and open the intriguing possibilities of mhd multiscaling universality classes being parametrised by the mean magnetic field . some of the quantitative details will change if one retains terms which are higher order in @xmath16 ; however , we believe that the qualitative picture will essentially remain the same .",
    "as mhd turbulence forms a natural example of a driven nonequilibrium system with alfvn waves , our results are the first of its kind for a natural system . in our log - normal model approach",
    ", we did not distinguish between the longitudinal and the transverse structure functions our results can not be compared directly with those of ref.@xcite , where the longitudinal and the transverse structure functions are found to scale differently with multiscaling exponents which depend on the magnitude of the mean magnetic field in the presence of a finite magnetic helicity . in contrast our results apply to the multiscaling of the usual structure functions in the absence of any magnetic helicity which are combinations of the transverse and the longitudinal structure functions as considered in ref.@xcite which would also then exhibit a mean magnetic field dependent scaling . in particular",
    "we find that the usual structure functions multiscale less in presence of an increasingly strong mean magnetic field which is in qualitative agreement with those of ref.@xcite .",
    "although here we have restricted ourselves to the study of alfvn waves as relevant perturbations on the amplitude and the scaling of the isotropic correlation functions in the limit of small @xmath16 , our results indicate the possibility of the multiscaling exponents varying with the amplitude of the mean magnetic field .",
    "our analyses , when extended for finite values of @xmath16 and for full anisotropic structure of the correlation functions , are likely to provide further understanding of and resolve some of the discrepancies between the various phenomenological scenarios available for situations with large mean magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we leave this task for the future .    from a broader point of view our results",
    "demonstrate the critical role of wave - like excitations in determining the statistical properties of @xmath0mhd .",
    "the presence of propagating waves is not confined to mhd only ; they are a generic feature in many other naturally occurring soft - matter systems where such waves can be present in a viscous environment , e.g. , active polar gels in cytoskeletal dynamics @xcite and in the dynamics of self - propelled particles @xcite etc .",
    "we believe our results will lead to similar theoretical and experimental studies in relevant nonequilibrium soft - matter systems .",
