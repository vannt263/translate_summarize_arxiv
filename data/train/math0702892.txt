    "matheron  @xcite observed that , for @xmath13 and for all @xmath14 , the derivatives @xmath15 give the distribution of the lengths of the chords of @xmath3 parallel to @xmath16 .",
    "such information is common in _ stereology , _ _ statistical shape recognition _ and _ image analysis , _ when properties of an unknown body are to be inferred from chord length measurements ; see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for example .",
    "blaschke ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) asked whether the distribution of the lengths of chords ( in all directions ) of a convex body characterizes the body , up to rigid motions , but mallows and clark  @xcite proved that this is false even for convex polygons .",
    "in fact ( see @xcite ) the covariogram problem is equivalent to the problem of determining a convex body from all its separate chord length distributions , one for each direction @xmath13 .",
    "adler and pyke  @xcite asked matheron s question in probabilistic terms .",
    "does the distribution of the difference @xmath17 of independent random variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 uniformly distributed over @xmath3 determine @xmath3 , up to translations and reflections ?",
    "since the convolution in is , up to a multiplicative factor , the probability density of @xmath17 , this problem is equivalent to the covariogram one .",
    "matheron s problem is also relevant in _ x - ray crystallography , _ where the atomic structure of a _ crystal _ ( or _ quasicrystal _ ) is to be found from",

    "the lattice @xmath22 can be determined by the diffraction image . to determine @xmath20 it is however necessary to know @xmath26 : the covariogram problem enters at this point , since the covariogram of @xmath26 can be obtained by the diffraction image ; see  @xcite .",
    "enns and ehlers  @xcite express in terms of the covariogram the distributions of random line segments in a convex body , under different types of randomness with which they are generated .",
    "the monograph @xcite contains an extensive discussion of retrieval problems for convex bodies , while the survey @xcite deals with algorithmic aspects of reconstruction problems in convex geometry .",
    "the first contribution to matheron s question was made in 1993 by nagel  @xcite , who gave a positive answer when @xmath3 is a planar convex polygon ; see also schmitt  @xcite .",
    "matheron s conjecture is still unsettled for general planar convex bodies , but it has been confirmed for @xmath27 convex bodies , non - strictly convex bodies , and convex bodies that are not @xmath28 ; see @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that every convex polytope in @xmath29 is determined by its covariogram , up to translations and reflections ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath30 there exist examples of convex polytopes that are not determined by their covariogram ( cf .",
    "however @xcite proves that , if @xmath31 is a @xmath32-dimensional simplicial convex polytope in general relative position with respect to @xmath33 , the determination by the covariogram data is unique for every @xmath34 ( see next section for all unexplained definitions ) .",
    "the paper @xcite discusses various open retrieval problems related to the covariogram .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to sharpen some of the known results on matheron s conjecture , indicating how much of the covariogram information is needed to get the uniqueness of determination .",
    "we indicate some subsets of the support of the covariogram , with arbitrarily small lebesgue measure , such that the covariogram , restricted to those subsets , identifies certain geometric properties of the body .",
    "these results are more precise in the planar case , but some of them , both positive and negative ones , are proved for bodies of any dimension .",
    "moreover some results regard _ most _ convex bodies , in the _ baire category sense . _",
