    "brown dwarfs occupy the mass range between stars and planets . because they are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen burning in their cores , they continually cool over their lifetimes . in addition , brown dwarfs contract as they age , evolving from low to high surface gravity .",
    "thus , brown dwarfs do not occupy a main sequence , and the spectral type of a brown dwarf can not provide a unique determination of its mass .    the dividing line between brown dwarfs and exoplanets is customarily taken to be the minimum mass at which an object fuses deuterium ( 11.414.4 @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this mass boundary does not discriminate between the possible origins of the object .",

    "thus , better understanding of the properties of young and/or dusty field brown dwarfs may provide important insights on the atmospheres of directly imaged exoplanets .",
    "a number of field brown dwarfs having spectroscopic indicators of youth have been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to date , these studies have mainly focused on the optical spectroscopic properties of low - gravity m and l field dwarfs @xcite .",

    "there are a number of reasons to study young field brown dwarfs in the infrared .",
    "first , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of late - m and l dwarfs peak in the near - infrared , making them easiest to study at these wavelengths .",
    "second , studies of directly imaged exoplanets have been conducted in the near - ir , where the planet - to - star flux ratio is most favorable and ground - based adaptive optics systems have the best performance .",
    "thus , direct spectroscopic and photometric comparison of exoplanets and brown dwarfs is feasible in the near - ir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the near - ir spectra of the youngest brown dwarfs contain a wealth of gravity - sensitive features @xcite .    in this paper , we present the largest near - ir spectroscopic sample to date of young ( @xmath9200  myr old ) field ultracool dwarfs .",

    "we develop a set of indices to classify the gravity of these objects and create a gravity classification system for use in the near - ir that provides results consistent with gravity classifications from optical spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "these dusty objects provide an important test for our indices and classification system .",

    "optical spectral types for our sample are listed in table  [ tbl : spt ] and typically have an uncertainty of 1 subtype .",
    "however , young ultracool dwarfs lack any classification system at the near - ir wavelengths , both for spectral type and gravity .",
    "development of such a system is compelling for two reasons .",
    "late - m and l  dwarfs are brightest in the near - ir , making spectroscopic followup possible with moderate - aperture ( 34  m ) telescopes .",
    "moreover , previous studies have shown that the appearance of the near - ir continuum is strongly gravity - dependent , even at low ( @xmath15 ) spectral resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the major obstacle to a near - ir system is the heterogeneous nature of ultracool dwarf spectra at these wavelengths . unlike the smooth sequence of optical spectra ,",
    "the progression of near - ir spectra for l dwarfs is far more irregular , especially at @xmath6 and @xmath4-band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at fixed optical spectral type",
    ", there is also a large spread in the near - ir colors , believed to be due to the influence of gravity , metallicity , and photospheric condensate variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the overall shapes of the near - ir seds do not follow a smooth sequence , inhibiting the traditional approach of defining actual template objects .",
    "our large collection of spectra provides a unique opportunity to examine classification of ultracool dwarfs in the near - ir .",
    "we follow a two - pronged approach .    1 .",
    "first , we apply visual classification methods by comparing our sample with the set of @xmath3-band spectral standards proposed by @xcite .",
    "they have found classification is possible for field objects in this restricted wavelength regime , with the resulting near - ir types being very similar to optical types for the same objects .",
    "_ we show here that qualitative ( visual - based ) classification also works for young l  dwarfs , though there is a @xmath01  subclass systematic shift between the near - ir and optical types .",
    "then , we consider a quantitative ( index - based ) approach to classifying spectral types and gravities .",
    "previous near - ir studies have shown that the  absorption bands , as measured by flux ratios ( indices ) , are well - correlated with optical spectral type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this approach is philosophically different than visual classification , these studies demonstrate that prominent near - ir features do change in the same fashion as the overall optical spectrum , i.e. , they track similar physical changes .",
    "( in addition , even visually - based systems often rely on indices as a practical recipe for classification , e.g. , the approach of @xcite for l  dwarfs . )",
    "so while the overall issues with near - ir classification are not solved , it is possible to access information about the underlying physical properties of l  dwarfs .",
    "similar to previous studies for old field objects , _ we show that well - chosen indices in the near - ir successfully correlate with the spectral type and gravity designations in the optical , allowing us to classify near - ir spectra in a practical and useful fashion .",
    "_      we first compared our spectra of young objects with field dwarf near - ir spectral standards from @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the entire 0.82.5  @xmath13 m spectra of young objects are not well - matched by older field dwarfs , in part due to the redder near - ir colors of young objects @xcite . in some spectral regions ,",
    "however , the continuum shape is sensitive to spectral type with little dependence on gravity . in particular",
    ", we used the 1.071.40  @xmath13 m and 1.902.20  @xmath13 m wavelength regions to determine @xmath3-band and @xmath4-band spectral types by visual comparison to field dwarf standards ( figure [ vis_class ] ) . for each spectrum in our sample , we over - plotted the spectra of field dwarf standards ( normalized over the comparison wavelength region ) and qualitatively determined which standard best matched the continuum shape of our object .",
    "if two standard spectra provided similar matches , we assigned the spectral type intermediate to the two standards , e.g. , if the l0 and l1 standards provided equally good fits , we assigned a spectral type of l0.5 . for the majority of our objects , selecting a standard with 1 subtype difference compared to the best fitting standard provided a noticeably poorer fit .",
    "thus , we assign an uncertainty of 1 subtype to our visual classifications . for objects which had either particularly noisy or peculiar spectra ,",
    "several field dwarf standards provided equally good fits , thus uncertainties of @xmath162 subtypes were assigned to their visual classification .    to test for any gravity dependence of our visual spectral typing , we compared the near - ir spectral types of @xmath510 myr old objects in our sample ( twa members and objects with optical gravity classifications of @xmath11 ) to their optical spectral types . on average , the @xmath3-band spectral types of @xmath510 myr old objects are 1.3 subtypes later than their corresponding optical spectral types",
    ". the @xmath4-band spectral types for low - gravity objects are , on average , 0.1 subtypes earlier than their corresponding optical spectral types . _",
    "determining near - ir spectral types for young objects based on visual comparison to field dwarfs will lead to near - ir types that are slightly later than their optical spectral types . _ in addition to visually comparing our spectra to the ir standards , we also computed reduced @xmath17 for the 1.071.40  @xmath13 m and 1.902.20  @xmath13 m wavelength regions to assign spectral types based on the best matching standard .",
    "the spectral types determined from the minimum @xmath17 value agreed to within the uncertainties with the spectral types determined by visual classification ( @xmath161 subtype ) .",

    "figures [ jspt_hist ] and [ kspt_hist ] show the differences between our @xmath3 and @xmath4-band visual spectral types and published optical spectral types .",
    "another method of determining spectral type is using spectral indices .",
