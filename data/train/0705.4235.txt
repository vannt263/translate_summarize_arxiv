    "<S> an analytical formula is obtained to describe the evolution of the average populations of spin components of spin-1  atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> the formula is derived from the exact time - dependent solution of the hamiltonian @xmath0 without using approximation .  </S>",
    "<S> therefore it goes beyond the mean field theory and provides a general , accurate , and complete description for the whole process of non - dissipative evolution starting from various initial states .  </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results directly given by the formula coincide qualitatively well with existing experimental data , and also with other theoretical results from solving dynamic differential equations . for some special cases of initial state , instead of undergoing strong oscillation </S>",

    "<S> the liberation of the freedoms of spin of atoms in optical traps ho98,stam98,sten98,goel03,grie05 opens a new field , namely spin dynamics of condensates , which is promising for super - high precise measurement , quantum computation , and quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> sore01,duan02,molm94 recently , the evolution of spinor condensates has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> chang2004,law98,youli2005,pu99,diener2006 initially , the condensate was prepared in a fock - state or a coherent state confined in an optical trap . then , due to the spin - dependent interaction , the system begin to evolve where a pair of atoms with spin components 1 and -1 can jump to 0 an 0 , and vice versa , via scattering . </S>",
    "<S> finally the system will arrive in equilibrium , however the process is not smooth . in 1998 , the average population of each of the spin components @xmath11 , 0 , and -1 was found to depend sensitively on initial states and may oscillate strongly with time . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this finding was further confirmed by a number of research groups . in 2006 , in the study of the probability of finding a given number of bosons in a given @xmath2 state , the `` quantum carpet '' spin - time structure was found . </S>",
    "<S> diener2006 these findings show the amazing peculiarity of the spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> related theoretic calculations are mostly based on the mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> although , in a number of particular cases , theoretical results compares qualitatively well with experimental data , the underlying physics remains to be further clarified . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a study of the evolution of the average populations . </S>",
    "<S> we shall go beyond the mean field theory but use strict quantum mechanic many - body theory with a full consideration of symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> instead of solving dynamic differential equations under specified initial condition , we succeed to derive a general analytical formula to describe rigorously the whole process of evolution ( non - dissipative ) and is valid for all possible initial status . </S>",
    "<S> this is reported as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> it is first assumed that the initial state of @xmath3 spin-1 atoms is a fock - state with populations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the magnetization @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 and @xmath7 are given , the fock - state can be simply denoted as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> let the part of the hamiltonian responsible for spin evolution be @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant , @xmath11 is the operator of total spin . </S>",
    "<S> then , the time evolution reads @xmath12where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the all - symmetric total spin - state with good quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath7 . by using the analytical forms of the fractional parentage coefficients and clebesh - gordan coefficients @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , particle 1 can be extracted from the total spin - state as @xmath16 \\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath17 is the spin - state of particle 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients involved in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are given in the appendix .  </S>",
    "<S> inserting ( [ e2 ] ) into ( [ e1 ] ) , the probability of particle 1 in @xmath18  can be obtained , it reads @xmath19where @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23the summation covers @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) if @xmath27 is even ( or odd ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the particles are identical , each of them plays the same role , therefore the average population in @xmath18 is just @xmath28 ( this identity has been exactly proved numerically ) .  in what follows @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> is assumed ( the cases with @xmath30 can be thereby understood ) . </S>",
    "<S> the label @xmath18 may be neglected from now on if @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.([e3 ] ) is an exact consequence of the hamiltonian @xmath32 , no approximation has been introduced , it gives an analytical description of the whole evolution ( non - dissipative ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are time dependent and independent terms , it implies an oscillation surrounding a background . </S>",
    "<S> it is straight forward from ( [ e6 ] ) that @xmath33 , therefore @xmath34it implies that the oscillation is periodic with the period @xmath35 and @xmath36 is symmetric with respect to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since @xmath38 @xmath39 is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 therefore , once @xmath42 has been known in the domain 0 to @xmath43 , it can be known everywhere .  </S>",

    "<S> the factor @xmath48 has an exact analytical form as @xcite @xmath49when @xmath3  is large ,  @xmath50 therefore , @xmath51\\leq \\frac{1}{2 }   \\label{e9}\\ ] ]    in particular , when @xmath52 , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the value 1/2 was first obtained numerically by law , et al law98@xmath54 and was supported by the recent study by chang , et al chang2004 . </S>",
    "<S> now this value is obtained analytically , and is further found not depending on @xmath55 when @xmath56 @xmath15 must also tend to @xmath3 , therefore both @xmath48 and @xmath57 as it should be .    for the time - dependent term , @xmath58 in ( [ e6 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> depends on @xmath59  strongly . </S>",
    "<S> there are three representative cases .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(i ) when @xmath60 or @xmath61 , @xmath58 is distributed in a narrow domain of @xmath15 ( say , from @xmath62  to @xmath63 ) as shown in fig.[o]a and [ o]b .  in this case </S>",
    "<S> , when @xmath58 is roughly considered as a constant in the narrow domain , from ( [ e6 ] ) we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 is time - independent , @xmath66 @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 can be exactly rewritten as @xmath69 the denominator @xmath70 affects the behavior of @xmath71  strongly . in the neighborhoods of @xmath61 , the magnitude of @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> would be remarkably larger because @xmath72 is small , in particular , @xmath73 . in the neighborhoods of @xmath43 , the magnitude of @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> would also be larger due to the denominator . </S>",
    "<S> however , since @xmath74 , there would be a strong oscillation when @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) when @xmath76 , @xmath58 is distributed in a broad domain of @xmath15 as shown in fig.[o]c where @xmath58 and @xmath77 have similar magnitudes but opposite signs .  in this case , the summation in ( [ e6 ] ) can be divided into two , similarly we can define @xmath78the feature of @xmath79  is greatly different from @xmath71 ,  in particular @xmath80 , the denominator @xmath81 implies that @xmath82 would be large in the neighborhood of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a very different feature of evolution as shown later .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) when @xmath84 is not close to the above cases , the variation of @xmath85 against @xmath15 has a band structure as shown in fig.od , where neighboring @xmath58 and @xmath86 may have the same or opposite signs .    </S>",
    "<S> examples of @xmath87 calculated from ( [ e3 ] ) are given in the follows . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[t1 ] shows the evolution in the whole period 0 to @xmath35 , where the strong oscillation is concentrated in the neighborhoods of @xmath88 ( a ) or @xmath89 ( b ) , @xmath90  is an integer , due to the distinct features of @xmath68 and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> these figures show the symmetry in the period . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the duration of observation is much shorter than @xmath92 evaluate under the thomas - fermi limit ,  when the trap is described by an isotropic harmonic potential with frequency @xmath93 , @xmath94 is associated with @xmath95 , where @xmath96 ( 3.86@xmath97 for @xmath98rb ( @xmath99na ) . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows @xmath100  is only given in a short duration .    </S>",
    "<S> the cases @xmath60 are shown in fig.[t2]a to [ t2]e . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t2]a is associated with the experiments by the mit  group ( upper panel of fig.2 of @xcite ) ; fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t2]b and c are the cases that experiment error emerges which makes @xmath7 deviate from @xmath61 slightly . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ t2]d and e are associated with the experiments by git group ( fig.1 of @xcite ) , and hamburg group ( fig.5 of @xcite ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> where , all  @xmath101 ( in solid lines )  tend to @xmath102 1/2 or lower ( if @xmath7 is larger ) as predicted above .    </S>",
    "<S> the cases @xmath103 are shown in fig.[t2]f to [ t2]h , respectively . where [ t2]f is associated with the lower panel of fig.2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> sten98 [ stenger98 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the cases @xmath104 are shown in fig.[t2]i and [ t2]j . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7  is small the evolution is very steady in a very long period 0 to @xmath105 , then a strong oscillation occurs suddenly in the neighborhood of @xmath106 arising from the feature of @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , the evolution becomes steady again , and repeatedly .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath84 is not close to the above cases , two examples are given in fig.t2k and fig.[t2]l . </S>",
    "<S> the former one is the case discussed by law , et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( shown in fig.3 of [ law98 ] ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath58 is nearly chaos ( fig.[o]d ) , @xmath108 oscillates with @xmath100  with a very high frequency in the beginning , but suddenly disappears , and suddenly recovers , and repeatedly .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , this paper has essentially two findings    \\(1 ) going beyond the mean field theory , without the necessity to solve dynamical equations , a general analytical formula has been derived based on symmetry to describe the evolution of the average populations @xmath101 initiated from a pure fock - state . </S>",
    "<S> this formula is an exact consequence of the hamiltonian @xmath9 with a full consideration of symmetry , no approximation is adopted . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the analysis based on this formula can help us  to understand better the peculiarity of spin evolution . for examples , one can understand why  the oscillation of @xmath87 becomes very strong in somewhere ( in @xmath43 or @xmath109 ) , why @xmath87 is symmetric with respect to @xmath110 , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the results from the formula coincides qualitatively with existing experimental data or other theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that , when accurate experimental data come out , a detailed quantitative comparison can be made .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) a special initial state with @xmath104 and @xmath111 was found where the evolution of @xmath87 is steady in a very long duration from the begining until @xmath112  this special stability is noticeable .    </S>",
    "<S> when the initial state is not a pure fock - state but a superposition of them , the generalization is straight forward .    </S>",
