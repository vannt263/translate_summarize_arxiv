    "the pioneer space - crafts have been launch from earth on 1972 and 1973 travelling outwards of the solar system  [ , ] . in between the heliocentric distances of @xmath0 and @xmath8 , travelling at an approximately constant velocity of @xmath9",
    ", it was detected an unmodeled doppler shift known as the pioneer effect .",
    "if totally attributed to a physical acceleration , this effect corresponds to a radial acceleration ( towards the sun ) of  [ ] @xmath10    although the origin for this anomaly is so far not established , many possible explanations for this effect have been considered in the literature , including modified gravity theories and models  [ ] , non - gravitational interactions  [ ] , extra - dimensional theories and models  [ ] and dark matter  [ ] .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to investigate whether the pioneer effect can be consistently obtained due to a background described by the ela metric  [ ] , an ansatz that interpolates between the schwarzschild ( sc ) metric  [ ] near massive bodies and the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric  [ ] at spatial infinity , hence describing local matter in an expanding universe  [ ] .",
    "the shift function of this metric can be fine - tuned through an exponential parameter allowing to describe intermediate scale gravitational effects  [ ] which may be interpreted either as due to local cold dark matter ( cdm ) effects  [ ] or modified theories of gravity  [ ] .",
    "although this fine - tuning is technically more challenging than semi - classical heuristic approaches , has the following advantages :    * it is a covariant formulation allowing to deal with cdm within the framework of general relativity ; * in particular allows for direct covariant computations of gravitational accelerations and gravitational red - shifts ( blue - shifts ) ; * allows as well for qft cross - section computations in curved backgrounds to include cdm effects ( a metric is required to define the dirac equation ) ; * it allows for the description of intermediate scale cdm effects maintaining the local and global known physical properties of space - time .    in the following",
    "we will employ two distinct coordinate systems , expanding coordinates , @xmath11 , for which the area of the sphere is @xmath12 such that the coordinate quantities correspond directly to measurable lengths and the standard robertson - walker coordinates , @xmath13 , for which the area of the sphere is @xmath14 being suitable for direct computations of measurable red - shifts  [ ] .",
    "the map between both these coordinate systems is @xmath15 and the ansatz for the ela metric is  [ ] @xmath16 & = & \\displaystyle(1-u)(cdt)^2-a^2\\left(\\frac{dr}{\\sqrt{1-u}}+\\frac{h\\,r}{c}\\left(1-(1-u)^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\right)(cdt)\\right)^2-a^2d\\omega^2\\ , \\end{array } \\label{ela_metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the universe scale factor , @xmath18 is the time dependent hubble rate , @xmath19 is the standard sc gravitational potential , @xmath20 is the standard sc mass , @xmath21 is the speed of light , @xmath22 is the newton gravitational constant and the solid angle line - elements are @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ".    this ansatz generalizes previous ansatz and solutions in the literature  [ ] allowing for local anisotropy  [ ] and having the novelty of describing a space - time without singularities at the sc radius simultaneously maintaining as asymptotic limits the sc metric near the sc event horizon and the rw metric at spatial infinity . to ensure these properties of space - time the following limits",

    "\\end{array } \\label{alpha_lim}\\ ] ] in the following we consider as ansatz for the exponential parameter @xmath7 a second order expansion in the gravitational field given by @xmath26 this ansatz allows for higher values of the corrections over intermediate scales than a first order expansion ansatz in the gravitational field maintaining the asymptotic limits expressed in  ( [ alpha_lim ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the remaining of this work , we will heuristically fit the functional parameter @xmath27 to the experimentally measured pioneer effect which is fully accounted as a background blue - shift and compute a finite non - null mass for the extended correction to the background which may be interpreted as a cdm extended distribution .",
    "the pioneer effect was measured using a two - way doppler shift  [ ] .",
    "the standard gravitational red - shift as described by the sc metric is null , as for the standard cosmological red - shift is negligible as noted in  [ ] being below the accuracy of the pioneer measurements .",
    "for this reason the pioneer effect is often attributed to a correction to the gravitational acceleration  [ ] .",
    "taking as central mass the sun and neglecting the contribution of other bodies in the solar system , the corrections to the gravitational acceleration felt by a test mass travelling in the background given by the ela metric  ( [ ela_metric ] ) with respect to the general relativity gravitational acceleration corresponding to a ricci - flat background described by the sc metric is  [ ] @xmath28 & & \\displaystyle\\left.-2(1+q)(1-u_{\\odot})^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}+r_p(1-u_{\\odot})\\ln(1-u_{\\odot})\\alpha'\\right)+o(h^4)\\ , \\end{array } \\label{f}\\ ] ] where the primed quantities stand for differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath11 , @xmath29 stands for the geometrical ( measurable ) distance from the sun to the pioneer space - craft and @xmath30 stands for the standard sc gravitational potential of the sun with @xmath31 .",
    "in addition there is a correction to the gravitational red - shift .",
    "the measurable red - shift due to the background is obtained from the line element  ( [ ela_metric ] ) . for a light ray travelling approximately at a radial trajectory with respect to the sun described by the four - vector @xmath32 , from earth at @xmath33 to the pioneer space - craft at @xmath34 and back to earth at @xmath35 we obtain that the ratios between the radial wave numbers of the emitted radiation from earth @xmath36 , the radiation received at the pioneer space - craft @xmath37 and the radiation received back at earth @xmath38 are @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the gravitational potential of the sun evaluated at the pioneer space - craft and at earth , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 stand for the universe scale factor @xmath45 evaluated at the time of emission of the radiation from earth , the time of receiving and re - emission at the pioneer space - craft and the time of receiving it back at earth , respectively . further noting that expanding the universe scale factor to first order in the hubble rate we obtain that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the measurable red - shift ( or blue - shift , if negative ) due to the background for a two way doppler measurement from earth to pioneer and back is @xmath48 hence the contribution to the pioneer non - physical acceleration due to the background red - shift is obtained by differentiating the standard two way doppler shift @xmath49 @xmath50 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial geometric distance ( the coordinate @xmath11 ) , @xmath51 for the radial geometric velocity of the space - craft ( obtained from the differentiation @xmath52 ) and we have neglected relativistic corrections ( @xmath53 for @xmath54 ) .",
    "hence , if the pioneer acceleration is totally due to the background encoded in the metric  ( [ ela_metric ] ) , it is the sum of the contribution  ( [ f ] ) and ( [ f_doppler ] ) @xmath55 assuming @xmath56 and an approximately linear functional exponent @xmath57 for radial distances above @xmath58 the pioneer data is fitted , within the error bars , for the values of the constant coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "fits within half of the error bars are also straight forwardly obtained as pictured in figure  [ fig.1 ] . within the range @xmath61\\,au$ ] the dominant contribution to @xmath62 is the background blue - shift , @xmath63 . as for the value of the physical acceleration , it is 4 orders of magnitude below this value , @xmath64 ( outwards from the sun ) .",
    "assuming the linear fit just discussed , within the solar system , we obtain that the physical acceleration is positive above @xmath65 increasing monotonically ( at @xmath66 its value is @xmath67 ) and it is negative below @xmath65 overcoming the newton acceleration below @xmath68 .",
    "these results are clearly not verified experimentally , the orbital motion within the solar system is driven and approximately described to a very good accuracy by the newton acceleration .",
    "this problem is straight forwardly solved by considering a cut - off at @xmath58 such that , below @xmath58 , this coefficient is approximately null . hence we obtain the following heuristic ansatz @xmath69 \\alpha_2^{(1.0)}+\\alpha_2^{(1.1)}\\,r_1 & , & r_1\\in[20,r_{\\mathrm{max}}]\\,au \\end{array}\\right . \\label{spline_1}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 being an arbitrarily small non - null positive constant that ensures that the limits  ( [ alpha_lim ] ) are obeyed  [ ] , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have also considered an upper cut - off @xmath73 that will be discussed in the next section . although not a very elegant solution this heuristic ansatz allows to describe the pioneer effect maintaining compatibility with the planetary motion within the solar system .",
    "nevertheless the effects of this correction to the gravitational acceleration should be measurable at least for pluto and neptune : as an example , for the ansatz  ( [ spline_1 ] ) , if this correction is fully accounted by an orbital radius variation  [ ] we would obtain , respectively , @xmath74 and @xmath75 which is well above the experimentally measured orbital radius variation for inner planets in the solar system such as venus and mars , @xmath76  [ ] . however further analytical or numerical results are required to exactly predict the effects on planetary motion due to this correction  [ ] .",
    "so far we have not analysed neither the mass - energy density neither the equation of state for the ela metric  ( [ ela_metric ] ) .",

    "\\end{array } \\label{rho}\\ ] ] we note that , for the linear ansatz with one single branch for all values of the radial coordinate discussed in section  [ sec.pioneer ] , @xmath81 , the mass - energy is negative below @xmath82 hence violating causality .",
    "the branch ansatz  ( [ spline_1 ] ) also solves this problem , for this ansatz @xmath83 for all values of the radial coordinate above the sc radius @xmath84 .",
    "when the limits  ( [ alpha_lim ] ) are obeyed  [ ] , at @xmath85 , @xmath77 coincides with the mass - energy density for ricci flat space - times , being null @xmath86 , and at spatial infinity it asymptotically converges to the rw mass - energy density @xmath87 , as well as @xmath88 such that at spatial infinity the rw equation of state is obtained @xmath89 ( this value is computed within the @xmath90cdm model assuming that the pressure of the background is given only by the cosmological constant  [ ] ) .",
    "hence this mass - energy distribution has been interpreted in  [ ] , for a constant functional exponent @xmath7 as a local anisotropic extended correction to the global isotropic cosmological background due to a local point mass vanishing at spatial infinity .",
    "in addition , when considering a radial coordinate dependence on the functional parameter @xmath27 , it has been put forward in  [ ] that the ela metric  ( [ ela_metric ] ) may also encode the corrections to the expanding background due to the existence of a local cdm distribution .",
    "if this is the case the total cdm mass can be computed corresponding to the mass of such extended corrections to the cosmological background .",
    "specifically the cdm mass within a shell of radius @xmath91 for a continuous ansatz is @xmath92 as long as the limits  ( [ alpha_lim ] ) are obeyed @xmath93 . for convergence of this quantity at spatial infinity",
    "more severe conditions than the limits  ( [ alpha_lim ] ) are required , in particular it can be fine - tuned either to be null ( e.g. for @xmath94 ) or to a multiple of the central mass ( e.g. for @xmath95 we obtain @xmath96 ) .",
    "however for the ansatz  ( [ spline_1 ] ) for @xmath27 , @xmath97 and there is a discontinuity at @xmath98 contributing a finite non - null contribution to the total mass .    further recalling that in average the ratio of cdm to baryonic matter is @xmath99  [ ] , if the ela metric corrections are to be interpreted as due to a cdm distribution",
    ", each individual body should have a non - null finite value for the quantity @xmath100 contributing to @xmath101 .",
    "this is straight forwardly achieved by considering a non - continuous upper cut - off for @xmath7 at some value of the radial coordinate @xmath102 such that above this value @xmath103 and the metric for large radii coincides with the original isotropic mcvittie metric  [ ] for which @xmath104 . the cdm mass of this extended configuration is given by @xmath105 and the cut - off @xmath73 corresponds to the edge of the cdm extended distribution . for the sun ,",
    "assuming the ratio @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath107 .",
    "we remark that this upper cut - off also ensures that isotropy is exactly retrieved above @xmath73 .    as for the equation of state for the ela metric",
    ", we have already notice that at spatial infinity it coincides with the standard rw equation , hence neither the local baryonic matter correction to the background , neither the local cdm matter correction to the background modify the global equation of state : statistically the respective pressures are null @xmath108 , only the masses contribute to the global background densities @xmath109 and @xmath101 .",
    "however we do note that locally there are deviation from the global densities , pressures and equation of state .",
    "for baryonic matter with a constant exponent @xmath7 , the equation of state was analysed in detail in  [ ] . as for the extended distribution in the range",
    "@xmath110 $ ] corresponding to the ansatz  ( [ spline_1 ] ) , we obtain at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 such that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these values change monotonically up to @xmath117 where we obtain @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 such that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we further remark that the values of the equation of state , @xmath123 , indicate that this construction may be compatible with a locally anisotropic configuration of scalar fields  [ ] .",
    "again we note that , although a clearly unelegant heuristic solution not derived from first principles , this construction allows for the interpretation of the pioneer effect as due to dark matter , as well as , generally , allowing for a covariant description of local dark matter maintaining compatibility with today s global parameters of the universe .",
    "in this work we have considered a linear ansatz for the functional parameter @xmath27 of the ela metric  ( [ ela_metric ] ) which allows to describe the pioneer effect .",
    "the main contribution is due to the background gravitational blue - shift such that the physical acceleration contribution to the pioneer acceleration is only of order @xmath5 , hence 4 orders of magnitude below the measured pioneer acceleration  [ ] .    within this framework",
    "are also evaluated the orbital radius variation @xmath124 for pluto and neptune .",
    "orbital motion corrections to these planets are a common consequence of any gravity theory or model that allows to describe the pioneer effect  [ ] .",
    "however we remark that the construction suggested in this work allows to significantly decrease the magnitude of such corrections due to the pioneer effect being mostly attributed to a background blue - shift instead of a correction to the gravitational acceleration .",
    "in addition we also discuss the possibility of interpreting this effect as due to a cdm extended distribution from @xmath58 up to a cut - off @xmath102 with a computable fine - tuneable total mass @xmath100 . +",
