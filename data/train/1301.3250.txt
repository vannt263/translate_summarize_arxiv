    "<S> our grating - assisted coupling to graphene - plasmon polaritons forms an important platform for graphene - based opto - electronics applications .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) carbon - based material , whose unique electronic and optical properties have attracted a great deal of research interest .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite novel opto - electronic applications such as waveguiding ,  @xcite ultrafast lasing ,  @xcite optical modulation,@xcite and photodetection  @xcite have been realized by effective doping and gating of graphene . despite the fact that graphene is an atomically thin layer the optical absorption of a single layer can be as high as 2.3@xmath0 ( defined by the fine structure constant ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite nevertheless , for light - matter interactions this number is imposing challenges and restrictions for graphene - based opto - electronic devices .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one promising way to enhance the optical absorption is to excite graphene - plasmon polaritons ( gpps ) supported by graphene . by periodical patterning of the graphene , </S>",
    "<S> excitations of gpps in the structured graphene have been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally , e.g. , in one - dimensional micro - ribbons ,  @xcite in 2d micro - disks ,  @xcite and in anti - dot  @xcite arrays . </S>",
    "<S> it is desirable to have a continuous sheet of graphene because it allows in - plane charge - carrier transport . </S>",
    "<S> recently , gpps in a continuous graphene sheet have been experimentally detected using advanced near - field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite another method for excitation of gpps in a continuous graphene sheet is to use silicon subwavelength gratings .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite besides , the silicon grating substrate could end up as a favorite choice in the monolithic integration of graphene - based optics and electronics in the future .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this letter , we experimentally demonstrate the excitation of gpps in a continuous graphene monolayer resting on a 2d subwavelength silicon grating ( swsg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the swsg is realized by a nanosphere lithography technique ( a widely used technique for fabricating low - cost wafer - scale samples ) with a self - assembled nanosphere array as a template .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a chemical - vapor - deposition - grown monolayer graphene on copper is then transferred onto the swsg after chemically etching away the copper . </S>",
    "<S> guided gpp resonances excited in the graphene monolayer on diffractive gratings are observed in transmission spectra measured at midinfrared frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations and analytical resonance band properties are implemented to further support the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental demonstrations of swsg - assisted gpp excitation may open routes to build graphene - based plasmonic devices and circuits .    </S>",
    "<S> the swsg is fabricated in a single - step dry etching process by using a nanosphere array as a template . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1(a ) to 1(c ) illustrate the detailed fabrication processes of the si grating using nanosphere lithography . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , a monolayer of hexagonal - close - packed polystyrene ( ps ) nanospheres with a diameter of 600 nm ( size dispersion of 1% ) is formed on a pre - treated si surface by a self - assembly method [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the si sample is subjected to deep reactive ion etching ( d - rie ) for pattern transfer , where the self - assembled ps nanosphere monolayer serves as a shadow mask [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ] . due to the isotropic nature of the chemical etching from the plasma gases and directional bombardment of accelerated ions from physical etching in rie </S>",
    "<S> , the ps nanospheres are etched away in an anisotropic fashion , i.e. with different etching rates for the vertical and lateral directions . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the nanospheres become thinner while their transverse diameters decrease very slowly ( especially in d - rie process ) . </S>",
    "<S> a vertically aligned si rod array is achieved as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) shows a top - view scanning electron microscope ( sem ) image , where the si rods are periodically arranged in a hexagonal lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to transfer a monolayer graphene onto the fabricated swsg substrate based on an improved graphene transfer process .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite after releasing a para - methoxy - n - methylamphetamine ( pmma ) covered graphene by etching away copper and transferring the pmma / graphene stack onto the swsg , an appropriate amount of liquid pmma solution is dropped on the cured pmma layer to fully dissolve the precoated pmma . </S>",
    "<S> after mechanical relaxation the contact between graphene and the substrate is improved . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , pmma is dissolved in acetone . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) is a schematic illustration of a graphene - covered si grating and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](f ) is a sem image of a representative sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relatively large filling factor of the si grating and the advanced transfer method leave the flattened graphene in a good condition , e.g. , without pronounced buckling . to further explore the quality of our structure , </S>",
    "<S> a raman spectrum of the transferred graphene on swsg was measured , and spectrum shows peaks typical for single - layer graphene [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](g ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that the weak d - band intensity comes from wrinkled graphene regions where silicon rods are located .    </S>",
    "<S> we study the transmittance spectrum for the graphene resting on the swsg using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir , bruker vertex 70 ) at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> prior to measurements , the system was purged with nitrogen overnight to exclude the influence of water vapor in air . the unpolarized transmittance spectrum for the fabricated sample at midinfrared radiation from 15 thz to 45 thz is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , where the unpolarized transmittance for the bare swsg sample is taken as a reference . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum shows several prominent transmittance dips , e.g. , at 20 thz ( 1 thz = 33.3 @xmath1 ) and 33 thz . in order to support the measured results </S>",
    "<S> , we performed full - wave numerical simulations based on a finite - integration technique ( cst microwave studio ) . </S>",
    "<S> the intraband conductivity of graphene is considered within the random - phase approximation .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , an intrinsic relaxation time @xmath3 at room temperature is used , where @xmath4 is the fermi level , @xmath5 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath6 is the dc mobility . </S>",
    "<S> the hexagonal rods array has a lattice period @xmath7 = 600 nm , an inner radius of hexagonal rods @xmath8 = 220 nm and a height of the rods @xmath9 = 490 nm ( surface profiler , dektak ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated transmittance spectrum ( average result of both polarizations ) in fig .  [ fig2](b ) presents multiple dips , in a good agreement with the experimental one [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) ] , especially for the pronounced dip at  20 thz . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) shows how the resonance at around 20  thz mainly broadens when the relaxation time is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that the position of resonances associated with the gpp does not change , and that the resonance smears out as the relaxation time shortens , which is consistent with more general considerations . in this letter , @xmath4 @xmath10 0.35 ev and @xmath11 @xmath10 350 fs are used in the following simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> the dips observed in the transmittance spectra are associated to the excitation of the gpps in the graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , gpp modes can not be excited directly in a homogeneous graphene sheet on a bare translationally invariant silicon substrate due to large wavevector mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> when the homogeneous graphene is periodically modulated by the swsg , the gpp modes can be excited once the phase - matching condition is fulfilled , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave vector of the gpp mode and @xmath14 is the reciprocal lattice vector of the grating . to further illustrate the excitation of gpp modes , we simulated the transmittance spectra of the structure as functions of in - plane wave vector @xmath15 and frequency for @xmath16-/@xmath17-polarization [ electric / magnetic fields along the @xmath18 direction in fig .  [ fig1](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the low - order resonance bands are excited efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the second - order mode at 19.8 thz is well - excited for both polarizations , related to the deep transmittance dip at 20 thz in our measurement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to excite the gpp mode more efficiently , it is preferred that the incident electric field has a component in the direction of @xmath13 . based on this consideration , </S>",
    "<S> the incident electric field for the @xmath17-polarization is more codirectional with @xmath13 than the case for the @xmath16-polarization , therefore making the @xmath17 wave more favorable for exciting the gpp mode . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the @xmath17 wave can have a component out of the grating plane for the oblique incident case , and such an out - of - plane component of the electric field also contributes to excite the gpp mode . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why we observe a rich spectrum with deeper dips for the @xmath17-polarized light [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the electric field distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the gpp resonance are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) for the low - order modes of the @xmath16-polarization . from the electric field distributions of @xmath20 [ bottom part of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ] , dipole- and quadrupole - like patterns are observed , which are fingerprints of the fundamental- and second - order gpp modes . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent field enhancement near the graphene plane is a characteristic of gpps . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gpp modes are tightly confined to the graphene plane , and the plasmon wavelength is about 40 times smaller than the dimension of the midinfrared wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the deep subwavelength nature of gpps can cause flat resonance bands above the light line , which are almost unaffected when varying @xmath15 , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and  [ fig3](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the periodicity of the grating is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave , we can approximately model the grating as an effective medium with the permittivity @xmath21 , with the filling factor @xmath22 = 0.49 for our specific structure . then , the wavenumber of the gpp mode is approximated as @xmath23 the band structure of the gpp mode , i.e. , the @xmath15-@xmath24 relation , can be approximately extracted from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exct ] ) and ( [ ksp ] ) . for the hexagonal lattice grating composed of silicon , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest few bands are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) with @xmath15 varying along the @xmath25 direction in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the gpp bands qualitatively agree well with the positions of the absorption peaks , i.e , transmission dips in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) for the @xmath16-polarized case . note that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) is part of the results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this further indicates that the enhanced absorption in the graphene structure results from the excitation of the gpp mode . in particular , the excited bands around 13.8 thz and 19.8 thz in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) correspond to @xmath14 in the @xmath25 direction , while the dark bands around 18.2 thz are for @xmath14 in the @xmath26 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the dark bands is attributed to the symmetry mismatch between the incident plane wave and the bloch wave .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in conclusion , we have experimentally demonstrated swsg - assisted gpp excitation in a continuous graphene monolayer . the swsg is fabricated based on low - cost nanosphere lithography . </S>",
    "<S> an improved method for transferring cvd - graphene on copper is used to obtain a high quality of the transferred graphene monolayer . with the aid of the swsg </S>",
    "<S> , the excitation of gpp resonances has been observed in the measured ftir spectrum , confirmed by numerical simulations and theoretical predictions of the plasmon - band relations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach forms a basis for a paradigm in optical and opto - electronic detectors and light - harvesting devices . by applying proper doping or gating </S>",
