    "the _ small chvtal rank _ ( scr ) of @xmath2 is the number of rounds of ibn necessary to generate this @xmath13 .",
    "a similar definition can be made when @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "the scr of @xmath2 ( respectively of @xmath25 ) is at most its chvtal rank even though ibn may not terminate when @xmath26 .",
    "we show that in every dimension , there are systems @xmath27 for which scr is two while the chvtal rank is arbitrarily high .    in section  [ sec : supernormal ]",
    "we completely characterize matrices for which scr is zero .",
    "this requires the notion of _ supernormality _ introduced in @xcite which generalizes the familiar notion of unimodularity .",
    "we produce a family of matrices of increasing dimension for which scr is zero but chvtal rank is not zero .",
    "in section  [ sec : stable set problem ] we apply the theory of scr to @xmath28 , the fractional stable set polytope of a graph @xmath29 .",
    "we determine the structure of the vectors produced by ibn in rounds one and two . as a consequence",
    "we see that the normals of many of the well - known facet inequalities of the stable set polytope , @xmath30 , appear within two rounds of ibn .",
    "it is a long - standing open problem to describe @xmath30 when @xmath29 is a claw - free graph .",
    "we show that many of the complicated facet normals of @xmath30 when @xmath29 is claw - free appear in two rounds of ibn which reveals a uniform hypercyclic structure in these ad hoc examples .",
    "section  [ sec : lowerbounds ] contains lower bounds for scr which contrast with the results in the earlier sections .",

    "we also exhibit a lower bound that depends on @xmath12 for @xmath34 as @xmath29 varies over all graphs with @xmath12 vertices . a brief discussion of possible upper bounds and computational evidence supporting our guesses are also provided .",
    "the scr of @xmath9 or @xmath2 offers a coarser measure than chvtal rank of the complexity of the integer programs associated to them .",
    "the goal here is to determine how quickly the facet normals of an integer hull are produced from the normals of the rational polyhedron , ignoring the right - hand - sides of the facet inequalities .",
    "our main message is that , in many cases , facet normals are produced surprisingly fast by the chvtal - gomory procedure but the right - hand - side can take a long time to be computed , which makes chvtal rank high .",
    "the coarseness of scr can be a powerful organizational tool that can reveal the unifying structure behind seemingly ad hoc facet normals of a class of examples .",
    "an illustration of this philosophy can be found in example  [ ex : clawfree ] where we show that many difficult facet normals that have been found for the stable set polytope of a claw - free graph are produced within two rounds of ibn .",
