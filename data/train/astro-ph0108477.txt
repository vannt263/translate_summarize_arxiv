    "there are about 200 known x - ray binaries in our galaxy .",
    "these contain either a neutron star or a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "about one third of them are classified as transients ( see @xcite for a review).some of the x - ray transients , most notably be - binary pulsars , erupt on regular intervals , while others erupt dramatically , but irregularly , with peak luminosities above 10@xmath3 erg / s and typical decay timesorder a month .",
    "this last group represent the majority of known galactic black hole candidates , and provides the best opportunity to study the processes near black hole in relative proximity to the earth .",
    "galactic transients have been therefore a focus of substantial observational and theoretical effort by x - ray astronomers .",
    "much less , however , is known about x - ray transients in other galaxies .",
    "previous observations with _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ were too sparse in time for any systematic monitoring of even nearby galaxies .",
    "the new capabilities provided by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ started to make the difference .",
    "x - ray observations of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , the closest spiral galaxy to our own ( we assume @xmath4760 kpc distance throughout this letter - van der bergh 2000 ) , are of special interest , because m31 is in many respects similar to the milky way .",
    "m31 was observed previously with _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ , and hundreds of x - ray sources were detected ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this letter discusses transients discovered in the m31 core in recent sensitive observations by _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_.",
    "we analyzed a series of _ chandra _ data consisting of seven observations with advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) and seven high resolution camera ( hrc ) observations .",
    "we used all publicly available observations of m31 central region covering the period from oct 1999 to july 2000 ( table [ obslog ] ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the observations can be found in @xcite ( hereafter g00 ) and @xcite .",
    "the data were processed using the ciao v2.1.2 threads .",
    "we generated x - ray images of the central region of m31 ( fig .",
    "[ image_general ] ) , and performed a wavelet deconvolution of the images to detect and localize point sources . because of calibration uncertainties below 0.3 kev and high background above 7 kev , we excuded acis data outside these energy limits . to estimate energy fluxes and spectra , we extracted counts within source circular regions of @xmath5 to @xmath6 radii ( depending on the distance of the source from the telescope axis ) .",
    "background counts were extracted from the adjacent source - free regions .",
    "spectra of the bright hard sources ( xmmu  j004234.1 + 411808 and cxo  j004242.0 + 411608 ) were fitted with an absorbed power law model using xspec v.11 .",
    "the acis count rates were converted into energy fluxes using the analytical fits to the spectra for brighter sources or pimms with standard parameters otherwise .",
    "for the hrc the source fluxes were estimated by pimms , based on the observed count rates and the spectral parameters measured by acis and _ xmm - newton_.    the central region of m31 was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ on june 25 and december 28 , 2000 ( @xcite , hereafter s01 ; @xcite , hereafter o01 ; @xcite , hereafter t01 ) as a part of performance verification ( pv ) program ( table [ obslog ] ) . in our analysis",
    "we used the data from two european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instruments : the mos1 and mos2 detectors ( @xcite ) . in all observations the epic instruments operated in",
    "_ full window _ mode ( @xmath7 fov ) with a medium optical blocking filter .",
    "we reduced epic data with the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v5.01 ) . to obtain the spectra of individual point sources",
    ", we used a source circle of @xmath8 and took backgrounds from adjacent source - free regions .",
    "we used data in the @xmath9 kev energy range , for consistency with _",
    "chandra _ data and because of uncertainties in the calibration of the epic instruments .",
    "this is the default energy band for all fluxes and luminosities presented below .",
    "the energy spectra of the two hard sources ( xmmu  j004234.1 + 411808 and cxo  j004242.0 + 41608 ) were fitted to an absorbed power law , and an absorbed black body radiation model was applied to fit the spectrum of the supersoft transient xmmu j004319.4 + 411759 ( table [ spec_par ] ) . since the flux from the latter was negligible above 1.5 kev , we considered only its @xmath10 kev spectrum .",
    "epic - mos1 and mos2 data were fit simultaneously , but with independent normalizations .",
    "a new bright source , xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 , was discovered on june 25 , 2000 during the first _ xmm - newton _ observation of m31 ( s01 , o01 , t01 ) .",
    "our analysis of the archival _ chandra _ data revealed the presence of a bright x - ray source at the position consistent with xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 as early as june 21 , 2000 , and again on july 2 and july 29 ( table [ obslog ] ) .",
    "based on the _ chandra _ aspect solution , which is currently limited by systematics to @xmath11 accuracy , we measure the position of xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 to be @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( 2000 equinox ) .    the x - ray light curve of xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 shown in fig . [ lc_general]a . combining the results of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ observations",
    ", we place an upper limit on the effective duration of the outburst of @xmath1440 days .",
    "we have no measurements of the outburst rise , but it was shorter than 20 days and followed by a slower decay .",
    "a fit to decaying part of the light curve with an exponential gives a characteristic e - folding time : @xmath15 days .",
    "the source flux declined from @xmath16 erg s@xmath2 @xmath17 on june 21 to @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 @xmath17 on july 29 , which corresponds to the luminosity drop from @xmath19 erg s@xmath2 to @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 . from the acis observations prior to the outburst , and assuming the same spectrum as measured by _",
    "xmm _ , we compute a @xmath21 upper limit to the quiescent luminosity of @xmath22 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath23 times lower than maximum measured luminosity .",
    "the energy spectrum of the source measured with acis - s on july 2 is similar to one detected with epic - mos a week earlier ( fig .",
    "[ spec_fig]_a _ ) and both may be fit to an absorbed power law with @xmath242.1 ( see table [ spec_par ] for fit parameters ) .",
    "the energy spectrum and x - ray luminosity of xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 correspond to the hard / low spectral state of galactic black hole candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the x - ray evolution of the source is typical for well established class of x - ray novae with fast - rise - exponential - decay ( fred- type ) lightcurves ( @xcite ) . for many of these objects",
    ", radial velocity measurements proved that binary systems harbor black holes .",
    "we propose that xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 is an x - ray nova and the first stellar mass black hole candidate in m31 .",
    "the x - ray source cxo  j004242.0 + 411608 was discovered on december 1999 during the first _",
    "observation of m31 ( g00 ) and remained detectable throughout whole y2k ( o01 , t01 ) .",
    "the source was not detected with _",
    "xmm _ on june 29 , 2001 ( @xcite ) , which sets a lower limit of @xmath4400 days to the outburst duration .",
    "the source exhibited remarkable stability of the x - ray luminosity and spectral shape throughout the outburst ( fig .",
    "[ lc_general]_b , c _ and table [ spec_par ] ) .",
    "the average energy spectrum may be approximated with an absorbed power law with @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the acis spectra of the source tend to be generally flatter than epic - mos spectra ( table [ spec_par ] ) .",
    "best - fit values of the absorbing column are also systematically higher for the acis . both discrepancies may be possibly attributed to the presence of a @xmath26 pile - up in the acis spectra .",
    "long ( @xmath271 year ) plateaus were detected in light curves of several black hole candidates , whereas shorter plateaus seem more typical for neutron star systems ( chen et al .",
    "the hard spectrum and long plateau make this outburst remarkably similar to the long - lasting hard transient grs 1716 - 249 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray transient source xmmu  j004319.4 + + 411759 was discovered on june 25 , 2000 by _ xmm _ ( s01,o01 ) .",
    "our analysis of may 26 _ chandra _ data revealed the presence of a bright x - ray source at the position @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( 2000 eq . ,",
    "error circle @xmath30 ) , consistent with previously reported _",
    "xmm _ position ( o01).the source remained active during the june 21 _ chandra _ observation . an energy spectrum obtained with epic- mos1 detector on june 25 is shown in figure [ spec_fig]_d_. it may be satisfactorily fit to an absorbed black body radiation model with a characteristic temperature of @xmath31 ev and absorbing column of @xmath32 @xmath17 .",
    "the spectrum of xmmu j004319.4 + 411759 is similar to the galactic supersoft sources and may be interpreted as a result of thermonuclear burning of the accreted matter on the surface of the white dwarf ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the source proved to be a pulsator with a @xmath33s period ( for more detailed discussion see o01 ) .",
    "the transient behavior of the pulsator hints that it may be a classical nova in the supersoft x - ray spectral phase , several tens of days after the peak of the outburst ( @xcite ; o01 )",
    ".      given a number of transient sources detected with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , one can estimate the total rate of transient outbursts in the central bulge of m31 . assuming a luminosity of @xmath34 erg s@xmath2 and an average source outburst duration to be more than a month , and taking into account the spacing of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ observations",
    ", we estimate a rate of @xmath0 year@xmath2 .",
    "we note a large uncertainty of this estimate , due to the limited statistics . about @xmath35 of a total amount of transients detected in m31",
    "are hard x - ray sources corresponding to @xmath1 outbursts per year .",
    "it is interesting to compare their number with a number of x - ray transient detected in the corresponding region of the galaxy .",
    "based on regular monitoring of the galactic center with _",
    "rxte _ and _ bepposax _ , the rate of hard transient outbursts in this region can be estimated as @xmath36 year@xmath2 , which is comparable to our estimate for the central part of m31 .",
    "this is firther evidence for the similarity between the stellar populations of the galaxy and m31 .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the _ chandra _ public data archive .",
    "this paper is based in part on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
