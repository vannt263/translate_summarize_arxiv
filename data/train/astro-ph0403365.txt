    "the inverse correlation of the broad emission line equivalent width ( ew ) with luminosity in agn , discovered by baldwin ( 1977 ) for the  @xmath0 line , was intensively explored over the past 20 years ( see a comprehensive review by osmer & shields 1999 ; and more recent studies by wilkes et al . 1999 ; green et al . 2001 ; croom et al . 2002 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ; kuraszkiewicz et al . 2002 ; and shang et al . 2003 ) . the physical origin for this effect",
    "is not clearly established yet , but a plausible explanation is softening of the ionizing continuum shape , and increasing gas metalicity with increasing luminosity ( korista , baldwin & ferland 1998 ) .",
    "the softening of the ionizing continuum shape with luminosity is supported by : 1 .",
    "some observed correlations of the emission line strength with the ionizing spectral shape ( green 1998 ; wang , lu & zhou 1998 ) , 2 .",
    "predictions of simple accretion disk models for the ionizing spectral shape dependence on luminosity ( netzer , laor & gondhalekar 1992 ) , and 3 . the dependence of the slope of the baldwin effect on the ionization potential of the emitting ions ( espey & andreadis 1999 ; green et al .",
    "2001 ; dietrich et al . 2002 ; kuraszkiewicz et al .",
    "non isotropic continuum emission ( netzer 1987 ) , and the intrinsic baldwin effect ( pogge & peterson 1992 ; also review in osmer & shields 1999 ,  5 ) can produce some of the observed scatter in the baldwin effect for the various lines .",
    "significant correlations also exist among various optical emission line properties in agn , including the [ o iii ] and fe  ii strength , and the h@xmath4  fwhm , which form part of eigenvector 1 ( ev1 ) in the comprehensive study of boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "boroson , persson & oke ( 1985 ) speculated that the underlying physical parameter which drives these correlation is the relative accretion rate , @xmath3 , a speculation which received strong support through recent observations ( see review in laor 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , wills et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that various uv emission properties , including the  ew , are correlated with the optical ev1 parameters , which suggests that the  ew may also be largely driven by @xmath3 .",
    "the baldwin effect may then just be a secondary correlation induced by the tendency of more luminous agn to have a higher @xmath3 .",
    "the possible role of @xmath3  in the baldwin effect was already mentioned by brotherton & francis ( 1999 ) .",
    "later , wilkes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) noted that narrow line agn are outliers to the baldwin effect , but the meaning of this result was not interpreted at that time ( see  4 here ) .",
    "most recently shang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested an indirect indication , based on spectral principle component analysis , that @xmath3  may contribute to the scatter in the baldwin effect .",
    "recent studies established that reasonably accurate estimates of the black hole mass ( @xmath5 ) can be obtained in agn based on the continuum luminosity and h@xmath4 fwhm ( @xmath5@xmath6(h@xmath4  fwhm)@xmath7 , and thus @xmath3@xmath6(h@xmath4  fwhm)@xmath8 , e.g. laor 1998 ) .",
    "this opens up the possibility to test directly whether the baldwin effect is driven by @xmath3 , which is the main point of this paper .",
    "the data set and measurement procedure are described in  2 , the correlation analysis is presented in  3 , and the main results are summarized in  4 .",
    "for the purpose of this analysis we use the bg92 sample which includes the 87 @xmath9 agn from the bright quasars survey ( bqs ; schmidt & green 1983 ) .",
    "this sample extends in luminosity from seyfert galaxies with @xmath10  erg  s@xmath11 ( calculated using the continuum fluxes in neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 , assuming @xmath12  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , @xmath13 ) , to luminous quasars at @xmath14  erg  s@xmath11 , where @xmath15 is calculated at 3000   .",
    "this is a complete and well defined sample , selected based on ( blue ) color and ( point like ) morphology , independently of the emission line strengths .",
    "it is also the most thoroughly explored sample of agn , with a wealth of high quality data at most wave bands .",
    "the ev1 correlations were established by bg92 using this sample , and the ability to obtain reasonably accurate estimates of @xmath5  ( and thus @xmath3 ) was demonstrated for this sample ( laor 1998 ) , thus making it an optimal sample to explore the possible origin of the baldwin effect .",
    "archival uv spectra of the  region are available for 85 of the 87 bg92 objects .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "archives contain uv spectra of 47 of the objects , which were obtained by the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) ; the uv spectra for the remaining 38 objects with no _ hst _ spectra were obtained from the _ iue _ archives ( see table  1 ) .",
    "an average spectrum , weighted by the s / n ratio , was calculated when more than one archival spectrum was available .",
    "this averaging should decrease the scatter in the baldwin effect induced by variability , as demonstrated in the intrinsic baldwin effect .",
    "three of the archival spectra ( pg  0934 + 013 , pg",
    "1004 + 130 and pg  1448 + 273 ) did not have a sufficient s / n to measure the  ew , and in one object ( pg  1700 + 518 )  is heavily absorbed ( e.g. laor & brandt 2002 ) , leaving a sample of 81 objects with a measurable  ew .",
    "the  region of pg  0043 + 039 is also rather heavily absorbed , and its measured  ew is probably just a lower limit .",
    "the continuum flux uncertainty of the _ hst _ spectra , which were obtained without the flux density uncertainty from the _ hst _ archives , was estimated using the average standard deviation of the flux at two windows : 1450    - 1470   , and 1710    - 1730    ( rest frame ) .",
    "the rest frame wavelengths were calculated using redshifts determined from the peak of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath16 line ( kindly provided by t. boroson , private communication ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the flux density uncertainty ( of the _ hst _ spectra ) was assumed to scale with the square root of the ratio of the flux density to continuum flux density .",
    "the _ iue _ spectra were obtained with the flux density uncertainty from the _ iue _ archives .",
    "the spectra were corrected for galactic reddening using the _",
    "e(b@xmath17v ) _ values from schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , as listed in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) , and the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "a local power - law continuum was fit to each spectrum between @xmath18    and @xmath19   , and the  line emission was fit as a sum of three gaussians , using the procedure described in laor et al .",
    "( 1994 ,  3 and the appendix there ) .",
    "wavelength regions suspected to be affected by intrinsic or galactic absorption were excluded from the fit ( laor & brandt 2002 ) . the purpose of the line fit is not to decompose the line to possible components , but rather to obtain a smooth realization of the line profile , which is likely to yield more accurate values for the line width and ew .",
    "table 1 presents our measured rest - frame ew of the best - fitting models to the  profile , together with the estimated errors .",
    "the errors were estimated by repeating the model fits with the power - law continuum displaced upward and downward by @xmath20 .",
    "as expected , the typical errors associated with _ iue _",
    "spectra are significantly higher than those of the _ hst _ spectra .",
    "one should note that larger systematic errors could be associated with the placement of the continuum windows .",
    "in particular , the presence of very broad weak wings is difficult to detect , although they may have a non - negligible ew .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to obtain some indications for the physical parameters which drive the baldwin effect in  through correlation analysis .",
    "we use archival _ hst _ and _ iue _  spectra of sufficient quality available for 81 of the 87 bqs quasars , together with the optical emission line parameters from bg92 , and @xmath22 from brandt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we find that a major source of scatter in the baldwin effect is the h@xmath4  fwhm .",
    "its inclusion as a second parameter to @xmath23 , in the form @xmath24(h@xmath4",
    "fwhm)@xmath8 , which is proportional to @xmath3 , leads to a significant increase in the correlation strength ( from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "this indicates that the baldwin effect is a secondary relation , which is induced by the stronger relation of the  ew and @xmath3 , and the tendency of high @xmath23 agn to have a higher @xmath3 .",
    "this also explains why nls1s , which are high @xmath3agn at a low @xmath23 , have much lower  ew than expected for their @xmath23 ( as found by wilkes et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we do not know the physical mechanism responsible for the reduction in the  ew with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "however , we find that the scatter in the baldwin effect can be further reduced by including either the [ ]  ew , the relative  strength , or @xmath22 , as a third parameter",
    ". the  strength may be an indicator of the blr optical depth , and @xmath22 may be an indicator of the ionizing continuum shape , which are known theoretically to affect the  ew . the physical mechanism implied by the correlation with the [ ]  ew remains to be understood .",
    "at least some of the remaining scatter can be produced by a non - isotropic , or a time variable continuum source .",
    "the results presented here can be tested with larger samples of agn .",
    "in particular , it will be interesting to explore the extension to high @xmath27 agn , where the h@xmath4  region is observable in the ir ( e.g. mcintosh et al .",
    "1999 ; yuan & wills , 2003 ; shemmer et al .",
    "in addition , different lines show different slopes for the baldwin effect , and it will be interesting to explore what are the primary physical parameters which drive other emission lines .",
    "we thank the referee for some very helpful remarks . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
