    "to gain further insight and to corroborate the picture obtained by monte carlo calculations and by explicitly comparing the energies of different states , we took advantage of the in principal one - dimensional structure of the relevant configurations ( i.e. diagonal stripes , see fig.1 ) and mapped the original hamiltonian ( [ eq6 ] ) onto a one - dimensional ising model in a magnetic field with the hamiltonian :      here @xmath79 represents the normalized sums of the spins on the diagonals and the one - dimensional interaction is orthogonal to the stripes .",
    "note that this hamiltonian contains all possible diagonal stripe configurations . using this one - dimensional model we checked systematically for possible diagonal stripe configurations up to unit cell of 18 .    from eq.[one",
    "] one sees that  once diagonal stripes are confirmed as ground states  the role of @xmath74 is a mere modification of the next nearest neighbour coupling ( plus an irrelevant constant ) and hence a shift of the phase boundaries by @xmath75 .        with @xmath81 and @xmath82 as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "due to the ferromagnetic interaction @xmath83 in @xmath37-direction , the stripes are vertically oriented in the case of eq.[annni ] and the corresponding one - dimensional hamiltonian is      @xmath85 eq.([one_annni ] ) differs from @xmath86 eq .",

    "<S> in many transition metal compounds , in particular those containing fe@xmath0 and co@xmath1 , there occur spin - state transitions between low - spin and high - spin ( or intermediate - spin ) states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that typical interactions between similar spin - state ions are short - range repulsion , and long - range interaction which can have different sign depending on the elastic anisotropy of the lattice and on the direction between respective ions . due to such character of effective interactions at the spin - state transitions </S>",
    "<S> there may occur different superstructures  ordered arrangement of different spin - states , which in particular may have the form of stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the system tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 for which such a superstructure was recently observed experimentally , are discussed from this point of view .    </S>",
    "<S> there exist many transition metal compounds in which , due to a competition between crystal field splitting and intra - atomic hund s rule exchange , different spin states lie close in energy . </S>",
    "<S> such is often the situation for fe@xmath0 and co@xmath1 . for these ions the low - spin ( ls ) state ( occupation of d - levels t@xmath4e@xmath5 , s=0 ) , intermediate - spin ( is ) state ( t@xmath6e@xmath7 , s=1 ) and high - spin ( hs ) state ( t@xmath8e@xmath9 , s=2 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be stabilised at different conditions . in some cases there </S>",
    "<S> occur spin - state transitions caused e.g. by change of pressure , temperature or composition . </S>",
    "<S> there are many examples of such transitions among fe@xmath0-compounds @xcite , in particular with organic ligands . among systems with co@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the best known ( and still controversial ) is the case of lacoo@xmath10 . for a long time </S>",
    "<S> it was assumed that there occurs in it the ls  </S>",
    "<S> hs transition with increasing temperature @xcite , but more recent calculations @xcite and experiments @xcite point rather to the ls  is transition .    </S>",
    "<S> usually spin - state transitions occur between homogeneous states having predominantly one particular spin state ; often they are of first order . </S>",
    "<S> however as we shall show below , a quite different and interesting situation may occur : the interaction between ions with different spin state may be such that at the spin - state transitions an intermediate state may be stabilised , in which there appears _ a spin - state superstructure _ - an ordered arrangement of different spin states of the same ionic species , e.g. an alternation of hs and ls states . </S>",
    "<S> recently the first example of such superstructure was observed in a layered cobaltite tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 @xcite and its presence was suggested for ndbaco@xmath2o@xmath11 @xcite .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the form of interactions determining the character of spin - state transitions , suggest a general mechanism which can lead to spin - state superstructures , and qualitatively explain the superstructure observed in tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> conventional description of spin - state transitions @xcite relies on interactions induced by lattice distortions . ions with different spin states have different ionic radii , e.g. co@xmath1 in the ls state in vi - fold coordination has the ionic radius 0.545  , and in the hs state  0.61  . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , if we change the spin state of an ion , e.g. by transforming one of the ls co s into a hs state , it amounts to introducing an``impurity '' with larger size into a matrix ( the so called `` sphere in the hole '' model @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces strain in a crystal , and coupling to this strain provides the mechanism of interaction between impurities . in a model of isotropic elastic continuum generally used in treating ls  </S>",
    "<S> hs transitions @xcite , the only interaction remaining is that through the `` image forces '' due to a stress - free surface of the sample @xcite , which is attractive . with such an attractive interaction one </S>",
    "<S> indeed obtains homogeneous structures , transitions between which may be of first order .    </S>",
    "<S> in real crystals , however , the elastic interactions are more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> thus e.g. in weakly anisotropic cubic crystals there appears an interaction between impurities which decays rather slowly , as @xmath12 , and , most important , which has a different sign in different directions @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant of the order of unity , @xmath15 ,  @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the `` strengths '' of impurities ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of the impurity and @xmath20 is the corresponding volume of the matrix ) , and the angular dependence of the interaction  ( [ eq1 ] ) is determined by a function of the direction cosines of the vector @xmath21 : @xmath22 here the elastic anisotropy is characterised by the parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the corresponding elastic moduli . </S>",
    "<S> we see that e.g. for @xmath25 the interaction ( [ eq1 ] ) is positive ( repulsive ) along the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] directions and attractive along face and body diagonals [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] , and vice versa for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that , in contrast to usual assumptions , the interaction between similar states ( e.g. between hs ions in a ls matrix ) may be repulsive , at least in certain directions .    one can also show that the nearest neighbour ( nn ) interaction via short - wavelengths or optical phonons is typically also repulsive . thus e.g. in a perovskite lattice , </S>",
    "<S> when one puts a large hs ion at a certain site , it pushes apart the surrounding oxygens , so that it is more favourable to have small ls ions at the nn sites . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the effective interaction between similar ions at the nn sites is repulsive ( or equivalently , it is attractive between ls and hs states ) . as is clear from these arguments , one can expect in this case that not only homogeneous states ( ls or hs ) , but also certain states with ordered ls and hs ions can appear at certain conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> a convenient way to describe spin - state transitions and eventual superstructures is to map this situation to an effective lattice gas , or ising model . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the situation in which each ion can be in two states , e.g. ls and hs ( it may be also ls and is @xcite or , in the case of tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 , is and hs states @xcite ; for simplicity we speak below about ls and hs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce pseudospin operators @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 corresponds to a ls state , and @xmath29 to a hs state at site @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> according to our general discussion we can model the situation by the effective ising - type interaction @xmath31 , containing in general short - range repulsion , and a long - range part which decays as @xmath12 and which may have different signs in different directions ; this longer - range interactions depend on the details of the crystal structure , elastic anisotropy etc . , see eq.([eq1 ] ) . the relative energies of different spin - states , e.g. hs vs ls , will be described in this language by the effective `` magnetic field ''  the term @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the ising model with long - range interactions can give rise to a variety of different ordered structures ( see the well - known annni model @xcite or the treatment of the 2d ising model with the `` coulomb '' interaction in @xcite ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simplified model , which nevertheless contains the essential physics , keeping only a small number of pair interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the treatment of @xcite , where one has studied systems with fixed concentration of particles ( in our mapping  fixed `` magnetisation '' ) , in our present problem the relative number of different spins ( ls and hs ions ) is not fixed . consequently we should consider our system not for fixed density ( `` magnetisation '' ) , but for fixed chemical potential ( `` magnetic field '' ) ; the role of the temperature can be also mapped onto a magnetic field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a 2d square lattice , modelling the situation in tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 , which is the layered compound with perovskite - like coo@xmath2-plane similar to cuo@xmath2-plane in high - t@xmath33 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of our model is    @xmath34    here the first term describes the nearest neighbour interaction , which , as we argued above , is repulsive , @xmath35 ; the second term is the next nearest neighbour interaction along @xmath36 and @xmath37-directions ( [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] ) which we also take to be repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> the last term in eq.([eq3 ] ) describes the difference of the on - site energies of ls and hs states , which can be changed e.g. by pressure etc . </S>",
    "<S> ( for co@xmath1 the effective field @xmath38 will be equal to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the hund s rule exchange and @xmath41 is the crystal - field splitting between t@xmath42 and @xmath43-levels ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to see that for only nn repulsion ( @xmath35 , @xmath44 ) three states can be realized at @xmath45 for different values of @xmath38 : the state with all @xmath46 ( ls - states ) and with the energy ( per site ) @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of nearest neighbours ( in our case @xmath49 ) ; the state with alternating spins @xmath50,@xmath51,@xmath50 ,  , forming a two - sublattice `` antiferromagnetic '' structure in a bipartite lattice ( we consider below only such a case ) , @xmath52 , and the homogeneous hs state with all @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we would have jump - like phase transitions between these states with increasing @xmath38 , from the ls state at @xmath55 to an ordered array ls / hs / ls / hs    for @xmath56 , and to a hs state for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that this model quite naturally leads to the formation of a state with a superstructure of ls and hs states , similar to the one observed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one important difference of this simple case and the experimental situation observed in @xcite is that the ratio of ls to hs states ( is to hs in the real case of tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 ) is not 1:1 as above , but 1:2 , is states forming diagonal stripes in the 2d square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> but just such a state appears when one takes into account the second term in the hamiltonian eq.([eq3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to determine the ground state phase diagram of the model ( [ eq3 ] ) we employed a metropolis monte carlo algorithm combined with a single spin flip dynamics to cool the states to zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further compared the energies of all possible periodic states with unit cells up to size @xmath58 . in this way we found four regions with different ordered ground states : a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic phase , a @xmath59 checkerboard structure which is degenerate with @xmath60-stripes , and a @xmath61 stripe phase . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram for @xmath62 is shown in fig.1 ( as is clear from the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq3 ] ) , the phase diagram for @xmath63 can be obtained by changing @xmath64 to @xmath65 , i.e. by reflecting the phase diagram in fig.1 relative to the x - axis and changing @xmath66 ) .    since all the ground states are simple diagonal stripes ( except for the checkerboard phase which is however degenerate with the @xmath60 stripe phase ) we mapped the model onto a one - dimensional effective model , which is simpler to analyse and which served us for a detailed analysis ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study confirms the conclusions presented above and reproduces the phase diagram of fig.1 .    to summarize , away from the boundaries all systematic checks revealed no phases but the ones shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> note however , that on the boundary lines interesting degeneracies occur . </S>",
    "<S> thus e.g. on the line @xmath67 separating the ferromagnetic and the ( 2,1 ) phase all diagonal stripes ( n,1 ) consisting of n spins @xmath68 and one spin @xmath69 are degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> we stress however that these degeneracies are of no phenomenological relevance for the superstructures studied here , since they are strictly confined to the `` one - dimensional '' phase boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram obtained above resembles that of the well - known annni model , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 in ref.@xcite , with the difference that because of the ferromagnetic coupling between nn spins in one direction in the annni model , @xmath61 stripes in the latter are vertical and not diagonal , as in our case ( see the appendix for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , our result agrees with ref.@xcite where the model eq.([eq3 ] ) is discussed for @xmath70 .    from the results presented above we see that in a large part of the phase diagram we obtain the phase with ( 2,1 ) diagonal stripes ; this phase exactly corresponds to the spin - state superstructure observed experimentally in tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also considered the generalized model , including the interaction between the sites along diagonals in the plaquette , which according to eqs.([eq1],[eq2 ] ) should be attractive ( ferromagnetic ) : the corresponding model in the spin language is    @xmath71    where @xmath72 , @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> we found no new ground state phases emerging for this case , but the effect of the diagonal coupling @xmath74 is merely to shift the phase boundaries in fig.1 by @xmath75 to the right ( see appendix ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for a longer range interaction , e.g. the one of the type ( [ eq1 ] ) , certain other states may appear , depending on the ratio of the constants of the hamiltonian . the description of these states is a formidable problem even in 1d - case , especially at finite temperatures @xcite ( see also the results of numerical calculations in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will not discuss all the details of this problem here ; our main aim is just to demonstrate the possibility of the appearance of states with spin - state superstructures at corresponding transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we see that such superstructures indeed occur quite naturally if we take into account realistic interactions of hs and ls states via lattice deformation , including elastic anisotropy and interaction with optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the superstructure observed experimentally in tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 is stable for a certain range of parameters if we include nn and nnn interaction along [ 100 ] and [ 010]-directions .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the details of the properties of tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 and of the theoretical description thereof , a few extra points should be mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed above only the origin and type of ordering in the ground state , assuming localised electrons . </S>",
    "<S> in reality tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 undergoes the first order insulator  metal transition with increasing temperature at about 300 k. we do not discuss this transition in this paper , but one can argue that the energy gap in the low - temperature phase may be connected with the occurrence of the spin state superstructure . from this point of view one </S>",
    "<S> probably may consider this state as a result of the formation of the spin - state density wave ( ssdw ) , starting from the high - temperature metallic phase . </S>",
    "<S> ( the treatment presented above would correspond to a strong - coupling limit of this picture . )    </S>",
    "<S> another point worth mentioning is the suggestion @xcite that an orbital degeneracy may play a role in the properties of tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 . in general , indeed , there may exist @xmath43-degeneracy in the is state and @xmath76-degeneracy in both the is and hs states of co@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however from the experimental data @xcite it follows that this orbital degeneracy is predominantly lifted due to a rather strong tetragonal elongation of the coo@xmath77-octahedra which exists already in the high - temperature phase and which most probably is connected with the layered structure of this compound . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the is state for this distortion is nondegenerate , and only in the hs state there remains a double degeneracy in the @xmath76-sublevels . </S>",
    "<S> but the latter in co compounds is usually lifted by the spin - orbit coupling , which presumably would be the case here as well ( jahn - teller effect by itself would stabilize for the hs state not an elongation , but a compression of coo@xmath77-octahedra ) . </S>",
    "<S> this question , however , deserves further study .    in conclusion , we considered in this paper the properties of systems undergoing spin - state transitions , like the ones often observed in materials containing fe@xmath0 and co@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that the effective interaction governing the behavior of such systems  the interaction via lattice distortions  is more complicated than the usually assumed attraction between similar spin - state ions : typically the nearest neighbour interaction is repulsive , and more distant interactions may be of either sign , depending on the elastic anisotropy of the crystal and on the direction between respective ions . as a result of such form of interaction , different superstructures , consisting of ordered distributions of different spin - states , </S>",
    "<S> can naturally occur in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed from this point of view the spin - state superstructure observed in the low - temperature phase of tlsr@xmath2coo@xmath3 @xcite , and have shown that this superstructure can be explained by our model for a certain range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to look for similar superstructures in other systems with comparable energies of different spin - states and with spin - state transitions . </S>"
