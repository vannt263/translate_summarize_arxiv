    "the study of combinatorial problems@xcite with statistical physics techniques started almost twenty years ago@xcite .",
    "most of the efforts have been devoted to the calculation of the optimal solution of various problems ( traveling salesman , matching , graph or number partitioning , satisfiability of boolean constraints , vertex cover of graphs ... ) as a function of the definition parameters of their inputs distributions .",
    "central to these studies is the characterization of the properties of the extrema of correlated random variables , a question of considerable importance in probability theory@xcite . from a computer science point of view , however , the main point is the characterization of resolution times .",
    "concepts and tools issued from the analysis of algorithms have allowed so far to understand the behaviour and the efficiency of many algorithms of practical use  @xcite , sorting for instance , but progress has been much slower in the analysis of search procedures for combinatorial problems",
    ". these are sophisticated algorithms hardly amenable to rigorous analysis with available techniques@xcite .",
    "statistical physics ideas and approximation techniques may then be of great relevance to help develop quantitative understanding and intuition about the operation of these algorithms . to some extent , the study of algorithms may be seen as part of out - of - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "there exists a wide variety of algorithms for combinatorial problems@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , two main classes may be identified .",
    "the first one includes complete algorithms , guaranteed to provide the optimal solution .",
    "they essentially consist in an exhaustive albeit clever ( making use of branch  and  bound procedures ) search through the configuration space , and may require very large computational times , _ i.e. _ scaling exponentially with the size of the inputs to be treated .",
    "recently , notions borrowed from statistical physics as real - space renormalization and out - of - equilibrium growth processes allowed to reach some understanding of the operation of complete algorithms for the satisfiability@xcite and the vertex cover@xcite problems over random classes of inputs . incomplete algorithms constitute another large class of resolution procedures : they may be able to find the optimal solution very quickly , but may also run forever without ever finding it .",
    "an example is provided by local procedures e.g. monte carlo dynamics which attempt at finding a solution from an arbitrary initial configuration through a sequence of stochastic local moves in the configuration space . when specialized to decision problems ( for which the desidered output is the answer yes or no to a question related to the inputs , as : is there a way to color a given graph with 7 colors only ? ) , local search algorithms can sometimes be made one - sided error probabilistic algorithms@xcite .",
    "when they stop , the answer is yes with certainty .",
    "if they run for a time @xmath9 without halting , the probability ( over the non deterministic choices of local moves in the configuration space ) that the correct answer is no is bounded from below by a function @xmath10 going to 1 when @xmath11 .",
    "obviously this function depends on the size @xmath4 of the input : the larger the input , the larger the time @xmath12 it takes to reach , say , a 99% confidence that the answer is no _ i.e. _ @xmath13 . determining the scaling ( polynomial or exponential ) of @xmath12 with @xmath4 is of capital importance to assess the efficiency of the algorithm .    in this paper , we study this question for a local search procedure , the randomwalksat algorithm@xcite , and a decision problem defined over an easy - to - parametrize class of inputs , the random satisfiability problem@xcite .",
    "both procedure and problem are defined in section  [ sec_def ] .",
    "we also recall the main results proven by mathematicians on these issues , and present an overview of the phenomenology of randomwalksat .",
    "a major theoretical interest for studying the randomwalksat algorithm is that it is , apparently , of purely dynamical nature .",
    "detailed balanced is indeed verified in a trivial way : the equilibrium measure is non zero over solutions only , and the transition rates from a solution to any other configuration are null .",
    "the equilibrium measure is therefore of no use to understand long time dynamics , a situation reminiscent of some models studied in out - of - equilibrium physics e.g. the contact process for finite size systems@xcite .",
    "we are thus left with a study of the dynamical evolution of a spin system with disorder in the interactions ( the instances of the combinatorial problem to be solved are random ) , a still largely open problem in statistical physics@xcite .",
    "we show in section  [ sec_exact ] how the master equation for this evolution can be written as a hamiltonian ( in imaginary time ) for 1/2 quantum spin systems , and use this represention to get exact results and develop systematic expansions for the quantities of interest , valid in some region of the parameter space . in section  [ annealed_sec ] ,",
    "we present an approximate analysis of the randomwalksat procedure in the whole parameter space .",
    "we show that , depending on the value of the ratio @xmath0 of the number of constraints per ( boolean ) degree of freedom , resolution is either achieved in linear time or requires the escape from some metastable region in the configuration space , a slow process taking place over exponentially large times .",
    "interestingly , the dynamics generated by randomwalksat is very similar to the physical dynamics of ( spin ) glassy systems@xcite .",
    "some perspectives are presented in section  [ sec_conclu ] .",
    "note that a complementary study of the randomwalksat procedure was very recently carried out by barthel , hartmann and weigt@xcite .",
    "the 3-satisfiability ( 3-sat ) decision problem is defined as follows . consider a set of @xmath4 boolean variables @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "a literal is either a variable @xmath15 or its negation @xmath17 .",
    "a clause is the logical or between 3 distinct literals .",
    "it is thus true as soon as one of the literals is true .",
    "a formula is the logical and between @xmath18 clauses , it is true if and only if all the clauses are true .",
    "a formula is said to be _",
    "satisfiable _ if there is an assignment of the variables such that the formula is true , _ unsatisfiable _ otherwise .",
    "3-sat is a np - complete problem@xcite ; it is believed that there is no algorithm capable of solving every instance of 3-sat in a time bounded from above by a polynomial of the size of the instance .",
    "how well do existing and _ a priori _ exponential algorithm perform in practice ? to answer these questions ,",
    "computer scientists have devised a simple way of generating random instances of the 3-sat problem , with a rich pattern of hardness of resolution@xcite .",
    "formulas are drawn in the following way .",
    "repeat @xmath18 times independently the same process : pick up a @xmath19-uplet of distinct indices in @xmath20 $ ] , uniformly on all possible @xmath19-uplets . for",
    "each of the @xmath19 corresponding variables , choose the variable itself or its negation with equal probability ( @xmath21 ) , and construct a clause with the chosen literals .",
    "repetition of this process @xmath18 times gives a set of @xmath18 independently chosen clauses , whose conjunction is the generated instance .",
    "the random generation of formula makes the set of possible formulas a probability space , with a well defined measure .",
    "numerical experiments indicate that a phase transition takes place when @xmath22 at fixed ratio @xmath23 of clauses per variables ( in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is smaller than some critical value @xmath24 , a randomly drawn instance admits at least one solution with high probability . beyond this threshold ,",
    "instances are almost never satisfiable .",
    "the existence of this transition has not been proven rigorously yet@xcite , but bounds on the threshold exist : the probability of satisfaction tends to 1 ( respectively to 0 ) if @xmath25@xcite ( resp .",
    "@xmath26@xcite ) all the above definitions can be extended to the @xmath14-sat problem , where each clause is the disjunction of @xmath14 , rather than @xmath19 , literals .",
    "2-sat is an easy ( polynomial ) problem , while @xmath14-sat is np - complete for any @xmath27 .",
    "location of the threshold is rigorously known for 2-sat ( @xmath28)@xcite but not for @xmath27 .",
    "we shall denote in the following averages on the random @xmath14-sat ensemble by @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "statistical mechanics studies have pointed out the existence of another phase transition taking place in the satisfiable phase ( @xmath30 ) with a location , first estimated to @xmath31@xcite and then to @xmath32@xcite .",
    "this phase transition is related to the microscopic structure of the set of solutions .",
    "define @xmath33 the hamming distance between two solutions as the number of variables taking opposite values in these solutions .",
    "when @xmath34 , there exist an exponentially large ( in @xmath4 ) number of solutions , each pair of which are separated by a path in the solution space , that is , a sequence of solutions with a @xmath35 hamming distance between successive solutions along the path .",
    "the solution space is made of a single cluster of solutions . for @xmath36 , the solution space breaks into an exponentially large ( in @xmath4 ) number of clusters , separated by large voids prived of solutions .",
    "two solutions in one cluster are linked through a path while there is no path in the solution space linking two solutions in two different clusters .",
    "this clustering phenomenon , whose discovery was inspired from previous works in the context of information storage in neural networks@xcite , was subsequently found in various combinatorial problems@xcite , and rigorously demonstrated for the so - called random xorsat problem@xcite .",
    "it is a zero temperature signature of the ergodicity breaking taking place in spin glasses@xcite .",
    "its precise relationship with dynamical properties , and in particular with the computational cost for finding a solution is not fully elucidated yet@xcite .",
    "the operation of randomwalksat ( also called randomwalk ) on an instance of the @xmath14-sat problem is as follows@xcite .    1",
    ".   choose randomly a configuration of the boolean variables .",
    "2 .   if all clauses are satisfied , output `` satisfiable '' .",
    "3 .   if not , choose randomly one of the unsatisfied clauses , and one of the @xmath14 variables of this clause .",
    "flip the variable .",
    "notice that the selected clause is now satisfied , but the flip operation may have violated other clauses which were previously satisfied .",
    "4 .   go to step 2 , until a limit on the number of flips fixed beforehand has been reached .",
    "then output `` do nt know '' .",
    "what is the output of the algorithm ?",
    "either `` satisfiable '' and a solution is exhibited , or `` do nt know '' and no certainty on the status of the formula is reached .",
    "papadimitriou showed that randomwalksat solves with high probability any satisfiable 2-sat instance in a number of steps ( flips ) of the order of @xmath37@xcite .",
    "recently schning was able to prove the following very interesting result for 3-sat@xcite .",
    "call ` trial ' a run of randomwalksat consisting of the random choice of an intial configuration followed by @xmath38 steps of the procedure .",
    "if none of @xmath39 successive trials of randomwalksat on a given instance has been successfull ( has provided a solution ) , then the probability that this instance is satisfiable is lower than @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , after @xmath41 trials of randomwalksat , most of the configuration space has been ` probed ' : if there were a solution , it would have been found . though randomwalksat is not a complete algorithm , the uncertainty on its output",
    "can be made as small as possible and it can be used to prove unsatisfiability ( in a probabilistic sense ) .    schning s bound is true for any instance .",
    "restriction to special input distributions allows to improve his result .",
    "alekhnovich and ben - sasson showed that instances drawn from the random 3-satisfiability ensemble described above are solved in polynomial time with high probability when @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath42@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that , despite the quenched character of the disorder in this problem ( the same clauses are seen various times in the course of the search ) , rigorous results on the dynamics of this spin model can be achieved .      in this section",
    ", we briefly sketch the behaviour of randomwalksat , as seen from numerical experiments  @xcite and the analysis presented later in this article .",
    "we find that there is a dynamical threshold @xmath8 separating two regimes :    * for @xmath43 for 3-sat , the algorithm finds a solution very quickly , namely with a number of flips growing linearly with the number of variables @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ phen]a shows the plot of the fraction @xmath44 of unsatisfied clauses as a function of time @xmath9 ( number of flips divided by @xmath18 ) for one instance with ratio @xmath45 and @xmath46 variables .",
    "the curves show a fast decrease from the initial value ( @xmath47 in the large @xmath4 limit independently of @xmath0 ) down to zero on a time scale @xmath48 .",
    "fluctuations are smaller and smaller as @xmath4 grows .",
    "@xmath49 is an increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "this _ relaxation _",
    "regime corresponds to the one studied by alekhnovich and ben - sasson , and @xmath50 as expected@xcite .",
    "figure  [ schema]a symbolizes the behaviour of the system in the relaxation regime . * for instances in the @xmath51 range , the initial relaxation phase taking place on @xmath52 time scale is not sufficient to reach a solution ( figure  [ phen]b ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath53 of unsat clauses then fluctuates around some plateau value for a very long time . on the plateau ,",
    "the system is trapped in a _",
    "metastable _ state .",
    "the life time of this metastable state ( trapping time ) is so huge that it is possible to define a ( quasi ) equilibrium probability distribution @xmath54 for the fraction @xmath53 of unsat clauses .",
    "( inset of figure  [ phen]b ) .",
    "the distribution of fractions is well peaked around some average value ( height of the plateau ) , with left and right tails decreasing exponentially fast with @xmath4 , @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( figure  [ schema]b ) .",
    "eventually a large negative fluctuation will bring the system to a solution ( @xmath57 ) . assuming that these fluctuations are independant random events occuring with probability @xmath58 on an interval of time of order @xmath59",
    ", the resolution time is a stochastic variable with exponential distribution .",
    "its average is , to leading exponential order , the inverse of the probability of resolution on the @xmath35 time scale : @xmath60 \\sim \\exp ( n \\zeta)$ ] with @xmath61 .",
    "escape from the metastable state therefore occurs through barrier crossing and takes place on exponentially large ",
    "in@xmath4 time scales , as confirmed by numerical simulations for different sizes .",
    "schning s result@xcite can be interpreted as a lower bound to the probability @xmath62 , true for any instance .    the plateau energy , that is , the fraction of unsatisfied clauses reached by randomwalksat on the linear time scale is plotted on figure  [ plateau ] .",
    "notice that the `` dynamic '' critical value @xmath63 above which the plateau energy is positive ( randomwalksat stops finding a solution in linear time ) is strictly smaller than the `` static '' ratio @xmath64 , where formulas go from satisfiable with high probability to unsatisfiable with high probability . in the intermediate range @xmath65 ,",
    "instances are almost surely satisfiable but randomwalksat needs an exponentially large time to prove so .",
    "interestingly , @xmath8 and @xmath64 coincides for 2-sat in agreement with papadimitriou s result@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dynamical transition is apparently not related to the onset of clustering taking place at @xmath66 .",

    "the pauli operators are defined through @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the configuration obtained from @xmath86 by flipping the @xmath87-th spin .",
    "it is a simple check that the argument of function @xmath88 in @xmath89 is a diagonal operator in the canonical basis @xmath90 , with eigenvalues @xmath91 in @xmath92 , equal to @xmath93 if and only if clause @xmath80 is unsatisfied .",

    "operator @xmath97 is diagonal in the canonical basis too , with eigenvalues equal to the numbers of unsatisfied clauses ( also called energy ) in each configuration .",
    "therefore @xmath98 in ( [ discop ] ) acts as a filter retaining clause @xmath80 only if it unsatisfied , and with a weight equal to the inverse number of unsatisfied clauses : only unsat clauses can be chosen at each time step , each of them with the same probability .",

    "after @xmath108 steps of the algorithm , averaged both on the history of the algorithm and on the distribution of formulas : @xmath109 to denote the time parameter of this modified evolution , @xmath110 let us explain the meaning of this modification .",
    "the operator @xmath111 would have been obtained starting from the following variant of the randomwalksat stochastic process . at each step , choose a clause among the @xmath18 ones .",
    "if it is satisfied , do nothing .",
    "if it is unsatisfied , flip one of its variables .    in the thermodynamic limit , the fraction of unsatisfied clauses @xmath44 is expected to become a self averaging quantity , _",
    "i.e _ to be peaked with high probability around its ( @xmath9-dependent ) mean value . turning @xmath112 into @xmath111 thus amounts to a local redefinition of time , independent of the instance of the problem . in definition  ( [ def_wp ] ) , the operator @xmath113 can be replaced with its mean value @xmath53 , leading to @xmath114 .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath115evolution of any observable in terms of @xmath116 can then be rewritten in terms of @xmath9 through @xmath117 examples of this time reparametrization will be shown below .",
    "let us first study the simple case @xmath118 .",
    "a clause is then a single literal , _ i.e. _ either a variable or its negation . if both a variable and its negation appear in the formula , it is obviously unsatisfiable .",
    "this is the case , with high probability in the thermodynamic limit , as soon as @xmath119 .",
    "static properties of 1-sat model are known exactly  @xcite , and its dynamics under the randomwalksat evolution can be solved too .",
    "an instance is described by a set of integers @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the number of clauses in which the variable @xmath87 appears , and @xmath122 is the number of times it has been chosen without negation .",

    "the fraction of unsatisfied clauses reads @xmath131 these exact results are compared with numerical simulations in figure  [ fig_enek1 ] . on the right panel has been drawn the asymptotic fraction of unsatisfied clauses obtained at large times , compared with the analytical prediction made above .",
    "the left panel shows the time evolution of the fraction of unsatisfied clauses as a function of time @xmath9 , for two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the analytical curve has been obtained through the rescaling explained at the end of the previous subsection : from the exact value of @xmath132 given above , the original time @xmath133 has been obtained by numerical integration ( eqn .",
    "( [ eq_rescaling ] ) ) , and the plot @xmath134 is a parametric plot @xmath135 , parametrized by @xmath116 .",
    "note that the asymptotic value of the energy reached is larger than the groundstate one  @xcite , @xmath136 = \\varphi_{gs}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is the @xmath138-th modified bessel function .",
    "this is easily understood : if a formula contains @xmath139 once and @xmath140 twice , the optimal value is @xmath139 false .",
    "but the algorithm does not stop in this configuration , as the clause @xmath139 is then violated .",
    "randomwalksat will keep on flipping the variable and make the average energy higher than the optimal one .",
    "we now turn to the 2-sat case , where every clause involves two variables .",
    "it has been rigorously proven that there is a sharp threshold phenomenon taking place at @xmath142 in this problem  @xcite : for lower values of @xmath0 the formulas are almost always satisfiable , beyond this threshold they are almost always unsatisfiable .",
    "the dynamical critical threshold of randomwalksat has the same value , @xmath143@xcite .",
    "thus there is no metastability in 2-sat : if a solution of the formula exists it is almost surely found in polynomial time .",
    "two questions of interest are : how fast will the number of unsatisfiable clauses decrease during the evolution of the process and how long will it take the algorithm to find a solution for @xmath144 ? what will be the typical energy after a long run of the algorithm when @xmath145 ?",
    "in this and the next subsections we shall address the first of these two questions , and leave the second one to the next section .    as in the @xmath118 case , one can use the quantum formalism and write down the evolution operator @xmath146 .",

    "yet , a cluster expansion in powers of @xmath0 can be implemented .",
    "a detailed presentation of this cluster expansion in a closely related context has been given elsewhere  @xcite ; the reader is referred to this previous work for more details .",
    "the method is presented below for a generic value of @xmath14 .",
    "we call cluster and denote @xmath150 a maximal set of variables connected by clauses .",
    "any formula @xmath151 can be decomposed as a conjunction of these clusters ( note that despite the similarities in denominations , these clusters have nothing to do with the clustering phenomenon in configuration space ) .",
    "consider now a quantity @xmath152 , depending of the realization of the disorder , namely of formula @xmath151 , and additive with respect to the clusters decomposition , @xmath153 .",
    "calculation of the average @xmath154 $ ] over the random ensemble formulas of @xmath152 can be done as follows .",
    "first , consider the different possible topologies @xmath155 of the clusters , compute @xmath154_s$ ] , the quantity averaged over the choices of signs for a given topology _",
    "i.e. _ whether variables appear negated or not in a clause .",
    "secondly , add up these contributions with combinatorial factors giving the frequency of appearance of the different topologies , @xmath156 = \\sum_s \\frac{1}{\\alpha l_s } p_s [ q]_s \\label{generic_cluster_sum}\\ ] ] the sum runs over the different topologies , @xmath157 is the number of sites in such a cluster , and @xmath158 is the probability of a given site belonging to an @xmath155-type cluster . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the finite - size clusters which contribute to this sum are tree - like : @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the number of clauses of the cluster , and @xmath161 a symmetry factor . the smallest tree - like clusters",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig_clus ] .",
    "clauses are represented by dashed lines ( for @xmath141 ) or stars ( for @xmath162 ) . in principle , such an expansion is meaningful only below the percolation threshold of the underlying random hypergraph , @xmath163 . beyond @xmath164 , a giant component appear , whereas the series  ( [ generic_cluster_sum ] ) takes into account clusters of size @xmath165 only .",
    "however , rearranging the series as an expansion in powers of @xmath0 ( expanding out the exponential in @xmath158 ) allows to extend its domain of validity beyond @xmath164 , at least for quantities that are not singular at the percolation threshold .",
    "this method can be employed here : the evolution operator @xmath111 is a sum of operators for each cluster @xmath166 .",
    "operators attached to two distinct clusters commute with each other as they do not have common variables . the energy operator @xmath97 can also be written as a sum over the clusters , thus the energy averaged over the history of the algorithm has the property of additivity over clusters if the time evolution is studied in terms of @xmath116 .",
    "after averaging over the formulas , the fraction of unsatisfied clauses reads , @xmath167_s\\ ] ] the evolution and energy operators for a cluster with @xmath138 variables are @xmath168 matrices , @xmath169 and @xmath170 respectively . with the help of a symbolic computation software",

    "we have performed this task for clusters with up to four sites , their contributions are summarized in table  [ table_k2 ] .",
    "up to order @xmath175 , the expansion leads to @xmath176 the typical value @xmath134 of the fraction of unsatisfied clauses after @xmath177 steps of the algorithm is obtained from ( [ phideu ] ) through the rescaling of time defined in eqn .",
    "( [ eq_rescaling ] ) .",
    "our theory is compared in figure  [ enek2 ] to numerical simulations .",
    "the agreement is excellent at the beginning of the time evolution , and worsens at the end .",
    "a factor of explanation is that during the last steps of the algorithm , the fraction of unsatisfied clauses is low and thus for finite - size samples , the self averaging hypothesis is violated .",
    "our approach is applicable to any value of @xmath14 ( note however that the size of the matrices to be diagonalized grows faster with the number of clauses in the clusters studied , that is , with the order in @xmath0 in the expansion ) but is restricted to the @xmath178 regime .",
