    "the theory of open quantum systems , which has been greatly developed in the past several decades , plays a critical role in the understanding and control of the dynamics of quantum systems that are coupled to the surrounding environments.@xcite the basic issues such as dissipation , decoherence , measurement , and noise source , etc . of the systems",
    "are usually investigated in the open quantum system framework .",
    "this theory has wide applications in the fields including quantum optics,@xcite ultracold atoms,@xcite and quantum information and computation.@xcite on the other hand , in micromagnetics@xcite and spintronics@xcite the magnetization dynamics is commonly treated as classical even though the control and dissipation parameters are couched as from quantum sources . while these methods have been highly successful in simulating magnetization reversal and spin - torque driven magnetization dynamics,@xcite there is the question whether there are quantum effects not exhibited by these classical treatments , when the magnet is in the mesoscopic range , of @xmath0 spins , between the molecular magnets and the macroscopic magnets as defined by ref .  .",
    "addressing this question may not only pave the way for the future technology developments , but also broaden our vision and deepen our understanding of the emerging mesoscopic quantum world between the well established microscopic and macroscopic ones . in this paper",
    ", we present a theory of a single domain mesoscopic magnet as a member of the family of open quantum systems for its spin - current - driven dynamics .    when the spin - polarized current passes through the ferromagnetism ( fm ) layer , the spin angular momentum of the current electrons is transferred to the fm layer and thus rotate the magnetization@xcite .",
    "this so - called  spin transfer torque ( stt ) \" effect has now become the most important method to control the magnetization dynamics in the nano - scale structures , where the conventional oersted field generated by the electric current is less practical@xcite .",
    "numerous magnetoelectronics devices have been proposed and fabricated based on the stt - driven magnetization dynamics.@xcite in spite of its great success and importance , the fundamental physics of stt in the standard theory is semiclassical .",
    "the magnetization dynamics is described by the classical landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xcite , while the stt terms in the llg equation is obtained from the quantum scattering of the spin current electrons by the classical potential of the magnetization@xcite .",
    "this semiclassical picture is expected to break down as the magnet is further miniaturized to the mesoscopic regime .",
    "furthermore , the stt has been used to stimulate and control the spin waves@xcite , or magnons .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated investigation of the stt in the full quantum picture is necessary in order to adapt the new developments in the field . in a previous study ,",
    "we shown that the continuous scatterings between the quantum macrospin state of a magnet and spin - polarized electrons in a simple model simulation not only induce the stt effect but also generate quantum fluctuations due to the quantum disentanglement process.@xcite in this paper , we will show that the quantum macrospin scattering model we exploited before is exactly solvable , and will investigate the magnetization dynamics from the full quantum picture by applying the standard theoretical techniques for open quantum systems to this model .",
    "in parallel with the original study of stt in the semiclassical picture@xcite , we consider the motion of a single - domain magnet driven by the spin - polarized current .",
    "however , the magnet here is not described by the classical magnetization vector @xmath1 , but is represented by the quantum operators of the total spin angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the spin - polarized electrons are injected along the @xmath3-direction in sequence independent of one another , and interact with the magnet located at @xmath4 through the exchange interaction .",
    "the model hamiltonian for each electron interacting with the magnet is@xcite @xmath5 where the first term is the kinetic term of a single current electron , and the second term is the interaction between the electrons and the magnet ; @xmath6 and @xmath2 are the unit and total spin operators of the magnet , and @xmath7 is the electron spin operator ; the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin - independent and spin - dependent interaction strength respectively , which are used in the semiclassical model if the operators @xmath6 and @xmath2 are replaced by their mean field approximation according to the correspondence principle .",
    "note that the hamiltonian is that of a free magnet without the external magnetic field and anisotropic crystal field .",
    "this treatment will simplify the calculations below without invalidating of the general conclusions .",
    "the stt effect originates from the elementary entangle - disentangle processes of the scattering states between the magnet and the spin - polarized electrons.@xcite these scattering states are deduced from the scattering matrix @xmath10 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamil2 ] ) . unlike the scattering matrix in the semiclassical picture , which is defined only in the hilbert space of the electron , the scattering matrix @xmath10 in this full quantum picture is defined on the larger hilbert space including both the magnet and the electron ( see appendix a ) , which gives the stt directly and more informations compared with the semiclassical case .",
    "consider the scattering of the magnet spins by an injected electron as uncorrelated .",
    "the incoming composite state of the magnet and the current electron is assumed to be a product of their respective density matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "after scattering , the outgoing states of the whole system , @xmath13 , as a result of the unitary scattering matrix @xmath10 , has a degree of entanglement .",
    "next , the surrounding environment decoheres the entangled state into a joint probability distribution of the possible magnet states and the corresponding electron states .",
    "properties of the resultant magnet state or the electron state are characterized by their respective reduced density @xmath14 or electron @xmath15 from tracing over the degrees of freedom of the other component in @xmath16 .",
    "the _ correlated _ quantum dynamics of the magnet and the electron injected in sequence in the spin - polarized current drives the time evolution of the magnet state @xmath17 and the magnetization - dependent electron transport properties in the electron density matrix @xmath18 .",
    "while the mean magnetization dynamics is within reach of the semiclassical picture , the magnetization fluctuation is given only by the full quantum treatment followed here without additional stochastic assumptions .",
    "for a theory of dynamics of the ferromagnet as an open system , we treat the current electrons as the equivalent of the environment .",
    "the kraus operator@xcite of the magnet is defined in terms of the scattering matrix @xmath10 as the evolution operator of each encounter with a current electron , @xmath19 with a specific basis set @xmath20 of an incoming electron state of wave vector @xmath21 and spin up or down state @xmath22 .",
    "we have adopted the simple model ( [ hamil2 ] ) for the dynamics of the rigid macro - spin states @xmath23 with the total spin number @xmath24 and the @xmath25 component quantum number @xmath26 and leave the effects of spin waves for future study .",
    "then , the current electron kinetic energy is conserved and the kraus operators are non - zero only if @xmath21 and @xmath27 are on the same energy shell , given by @xmath28 where the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of the basic parameters @xmath31 and @xmath21 , @xmath24 . the first operator @xmath32 with the same spin index @xmath33 comes from scattering without spin transfer , and the second operator @xmath34 with a change in @xmath33 represents spin transfer .",
    "these kraus operators are functions of the macro - spin @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( see appendix b ) . in the semiclassical picture , these kraus operators will reduce to scalars representing effective fields for the magnetization dynamics .    in a scattering event ,",
    "let the initial state of the current electron be given by the density matrix @xmath35 .",
    "this simple form may be extended to account for a wave vector distribution or quantum coherence between different wave vectors , but will not be exploited here to keep the exposition simple . with the above kraus operators , the quantum map of the magnet state from @xmath11 to @xmath14 in the scattering is @xmath36 if the spin - polarized current is considered as a sequence of electrons injected at equal time interval @xmath37 ( a measure of the inverse current ) , the continuous evolution of the magnetic density matrix driven by eq .",
    "( [ dynmap ] ) , with a coarse graining of a time scale much larger than @xmath37 , yields the quantum dynamics of the magnet governed by the master equation , @xmath38 ,   \\label{master}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] is the bloch vector of the spin - polarized current electrons , @xmath40 being the pauli matrices .",
    "the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 are polynomial functions of @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the unpolarized part of the current which causes fluctuations of the magnet motion without a net spin transfer effect . on the other hand , @xmath42 is induced by the electron spin polarization , giving rise to both stt and the magnetization fluctuations .",
    "note that the master equation ( [ master ] ) is an exact solution from the model ( [ hamil2 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath24 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ master ] ) can be applied to molecular magnets of small @xmath24 .",
    "this is in contrast with the simulation of the quantum stochastic dynamics of the magnet in a previous study@xcite which used the same scattering matrix but required the large @xmath24 condition to keep the approximation of the magnetic quantum state as a spin coherent state after scattering .      to facilitate computation in the large @xmath24 case and , more importantly , to study the quantum - classical crossover of the magnetization dynamics , we put the master equation ( [ master ] ) in the spin coherent state @xmath43-representation@xcite analogous to the boson case .",

    ". its value could be negative in some situations because @xmath48 describes the quantum state of the magnet as faithfully as the density matrix @xmath17 . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ fpe2 ] ) , the stt terms naturally arise from the open quantum dynamics of the magnet in the presence of the continuous scatterings by the spin - polarized electrons .",
    "unlike the semiclassical picture , where the stt terms are indirectly obtained from the current electron spin polarization after potential scattering , in the quantum case , the stt terms follows directly from the full quantum scattering .",
    "furthermore , the full quantum treatment also gives the quantum fluctuations accompanying the spin transfer processes , which does not exist in the semiclassical treatment .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath57 expression shows dependence on the relative angle between the magnet and the electron spin , with its maximal ( minimal ) value when @xmath50 and @xmath58 are anti - parallel ( parallel ) .",
    "this coincides with our previous simulation@xcite that the quantum magnetization fluctuation is first enhanced and then suppressed during the stt - driven magnet switching , which is observed in a recent experiment.@xcite for the special case where the injected electrons are fully unpolarized ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath57 is still a non - zero constant which again suggests that the unpolarized current can cause quantum magnetization fluctuations without net spin transfer .",
    "the steady solution of eq .",
    "( [ fpe2 ] ) is a constant , which means a uniform distribution function in the spin coherent state space and the magnetization will vanish on average .",
    "by contrast , the semiclassical theory predicts only the zero spin torque but no diffusion dynamics for the magnet .",
    "this stt - induced magnetization fluctuation becomes dominant over the thermal magnetization fluctuation at low temperatures .",
