    "agn jets emit synchrotron radiation that is often highly linearly polarized , which provides important information on the degree of order and orientation of the magnetic ( * b * ) field in these jets .",
    "`` blazars '' have jets pointed close to our line of sight ( los ) and often exhibit strong variability in total flux and linear polarization over a broad range of frequencies from @xmath0-ray to radio .",
    "recent mhd simulations have provided an almost complete explanation of how these jets are launched , accelerated and collimated close to the black hole , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dominant * b * field structure on these scales is helical .",
    "it is possible that this structure changes when the flow gets disrupted by shocks after a few hundred schwarzschild radii , but observational evidence of helical fields on scales larger than this @xcite suggests that remnants of the earlier * b * field structure remain or that a current driven helical kink instability is generated @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation manifests itself as a linear dependence of the observed polarization angle ( @xmath1 ) on the wavelength ( @xmath2 ) squared described by the formula @xmath3 , where the rotation measure ( rm ) is proportional to the integral of the electron density and the dot product of the * b * field along the los with the path length @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a positive / negative rm tells you that the los * b * field is pointing towards / away from the observer and combined with the corrected polarization orientation we are provided with a 3-d view of the * b * field structure .",
    "however , if the rotating medium is mixed in with the emitting plasma then internal faraday rotation occurs and the above formula does not generally apply .",
    "theoretical models @xcite of internal fr in a spherical or cylindrical region have shown that if a rotation of greater than @xmath5 is observed then the faraday rotation must be external .",
    "vs. @xmath6 for the whole observed frequency range of the core regions of 1156 + 295 and 0954 + 658 clearly showing a transition in both cases where physically different regions are being probed .",
    "right : for a `` head - on '' ( @xmath7 ) or `` tail - on '' ( @xmath8 ) view of a helical * b * field , different los components will dominate ( shown by solid circles surrounding the dot or cross which indicate the direction of the los component ) producing rms with different signs in an unresolved jet.,width=188 ]     vs. @xmath6 for the whole observed frequency range of the core regions of 1156 + 295 and 0954 + 658 clearly showing a transition in both cases where physically different regions are being probed .",

    "we observed 6 sources ( table 1 ) with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 8 frequencies ( 4.6 , 5.1 , 7.9 , 8.8 , 12.9 , 15.3 , 22 & 43 ghz ) over a 24-hr period on 2 july 2006 .",
    "all calibration and imaging was performed with the software package aips .",
    "the integrated foreground ( mainly galactic ) rms were subtracted using the multi - frequency vla observations of @xcite .",
    "this isolates the rm distribution in the immediate vicinity of the agn and is very important for source rest frame calculations since the rm scales with @xmath9 .",
    "these observations are ideally suited for faraday rotation analysis , with both long and short spaced frequency intervals , which significantly reduces the @xmath10 ambiguity in the observed polarization angles .",
    "this enables us to construct rm maps on a range of different scales and faraday depths , providing a wealth of information on the rm distribution and its sign in the core region and out along the jet .",
    "matched - resolution images were constructed for different frequency - intervals where clear transitions in rm occurred , corresponding to sampling of physically different regions ( eg .",
    "figure 1 left ) .",
    "the observed rms are generally consistent with the rotating medium being external .",
    "linear fits of @xmath11 vs. @xmath6 are found in most cases with rotations of greater than @xmath5 observed in several cases .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the degree of polarization of those with rotations less than @xmath5 do not fit the corresponding predicted faraday depolarization .",
    "the degree of polarization in the core has a curious u - shaped distribution where it initially decreases rapidly from its value at the highest frequency , faster than predicted by beam depolarization @xcite , and then after reaching a minimum increases at the lower frequencies .",
    "the increase in the degree of polarization at lower frequencies has a possible explanation in that higher polarized regions become blended with the core , as described in @xcite and @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the rm increases at higher frequencies , consistent with an increase in the electron density and/or * b * field strength closer to the central engine .",
    "this can be quantified using the relation @xmath12 derived in @xcite ; see table 1 .",
    "three of the sources are consistent with an outflow in a spherical or conical wind with @xmath13 , similar to the results of @xcite . however",
    ", 0954 + 658 and 1418 + 546 have significantly higher values of 3.5 and 4.6 , indicating much faster electron density falloffs in the faraday rotating medium with distance from the central engine .",
    "rm sign changes in different frequency - intervals are observed in 0954 + 658 , 1418 + 546 and 2200 + 420 . in the case of 2200 + 420 , the dominant jet * b * field is transverse throughout the jet , even as it bends , implying the presence of a global transverse * b * field structure .",
    "bends in a jet , surrounded by a helical * b * field , on scales smaller than is probed by the lowest frequency resolution will produce different dominant los * b * field components due to the relativistic motion of the jet towards us , see figure 1 right and @xcite .",
    "this effect provides a natural explanation for the observed rm sign changes .",
    "if there is no clear evidence for bends in the inner jet , then the same effect could be caused by an accelerating / decelerating jet surrounded by a helical * b * field ; although it remains possible that bends are present on scales smaller than our resolution .",

    "for a side - on view of a helical * b * field one would expect a systematic gradient across the jet with the los * b * field changing sign .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , a positive asymmetric gradient ( as detected in 0954 + 658 and 1418 + 546 ) can be explained by having the viewing angle in the jet rest frame less than the pitch angle of the helix .",
    "after correction for faraday rotation , the jet polarization orientation is aligned with the jet direction in all sources except for 1418 + 546 where it s transverse to the jet direction .",
    "the intrinsic core polarization orientations vary with frequency - interval because the different rms imply different zero - wavelength angles . using the highest frequency - interval rm correction or the 43 ghz core polarization angle ,",
    "the orientation of the furthest upstream polarized component is roughly transverse to the inner jet direction . since these regions are optically thick in all cases , the * b * field in the core is also transverse to the jet direction .",
    "this could be due to the toroidal component of a relatively tightly wound helical * b * field and/or a strongly shocked region of plasma .",
    "polarization observations with vsop-2 have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of the compact inner regions of agn jets . the excellent resolution provided by vsop-2 , combined with an array of ground telescopes , will enable multi - frequency faraday rotation analysis much closer to the central engine . the higher resolution of vsop-2",
    "will also reduce the effect of beam depolarization so that new polarization could be detected in previously unpolarized observations of agn cores .",
    "observations using the full power of vsop-2 with dual polarization at 8 , 22 and 43 ghz combined with matched - resolution ground array observations at multiple bands at 15 , 22 , 43 and 86 ghz will facilitate unparalleled analysis of jet physics in these compact regions .",
    "information on the 3-d * b * field structure , electron density , 2-d internal structure and spectral index much closer to where these jets are being launched , accelerated and collimated will test current theoretical models of jet production and propagation through space ."
