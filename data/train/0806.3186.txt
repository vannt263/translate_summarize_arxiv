    "decoherence is an ubiquitous phenomenon in quantum mechanics and any architecture of future quantum computers must consider it seriously .",
    "recently , it has been noted that already at the level of two qubits , the effect of a weak noise on each qubit is not simply additive when it comes to nonlocal properties .",
    "this effect , called `` sudden death of entanglement '' @xcite , means that the concurrence of two qubits has an abrupt decay in time rather than the exponential decay typical for single qubits . in this paper",
    "we consider the case of two qubits coupled independently to two reservoirs , and driven coherently and resonantly by two continuous fields .",
    "we find that two - qubit states which in the absence of the drive would have exponential decay now exhibit sudden death of entanglement .",
    "although the results in this paper are valid for any type of qubits , we will briefly analyze the case of superconducting - qubit architectures , where microwave fields applied to each qubit can be used to manipulate the quantum two - qubit state , creating entanglement , cnot and iswap gates , _ etc .",
    "_ @xcite . with the emergence , during the last decade , of a plethora of such superconducting devices as serious contenders for the role of the quantum bit , the effect of decoherence in these systems should be thoroughly investigated . while for the case of single superconducting qubits this has been already done to a large extend both experimentally and theoretically",
    ", there is yet no systematic experimental study of decoherence in superconducting many - qubit systems .",
    "also , circuit boards containing two superconducting qubits could be used as a workbench for fundamental studies of decoherence effects .",
    "we study a general model , similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be adapted in a straigthforward way to any species of superconducting qubits .",
    "we take @xmath0 , and we consider two non - interacting qubits which are coupled to two uncorrelated thermal reservoirs : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the larmor frequency of the qubit @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the qubit lowering ( raising ) operator , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator for the reservoir coupled to each qubit , respectively .",
    "each qubit is irradiated with an external monochromatic microwave field .",

    "as in other studies on entanglement sudden death in two - qubit systems such as @xcite , we assume that the initial state of our system is an state@xmath21 however , despite the fact that the stateis a rather general form of a density matrix , due to the existence of driving fields , the evolution under eq .",
