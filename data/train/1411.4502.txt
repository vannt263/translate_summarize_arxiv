    "domain walls ( dws ) separate oppositely oriented magnetic domains in ferromagnetic strips and have applications ranging from data storage@xcite to neuromorphic computing @xcite and biotechnology @xcite . applications typically exploit dw displacement and/or resonant dw excitations@xcite , the latter corresponding to precessional magnetization dynamics localized at the dw@xcite .",
    "these excitations can can be exploited in oscillators @xcite and magnonic devices@xcite as well as for assisting domain wall motion@xcite or depinning@xcite .",
    "the use of resonant phenomena in applications will however rely on successful control of the resonant modes of dws .",
    "it is known that large geometrical constrictions such as notches ( also widely used for positional control @xcite ) in micron - scale strips can be used to tune the frequency of a dw s translational mode @xcite . for smaller@xcite device geometries however , uniform fabrication of small notches may become challenging since the notches dimensions will likely become comparable to those of lithographic defects and edge roughness .    in this work",
    "we show how different dw resonances have different sensitivities to notches and that these sensitivities can be linked to the nature of the mode and the structure of the dw .",
    "for example , modes which involve either local or global translation of the wall can be highly sensitive to the presence , size and position of the notch .",
    "our work focuses on the resonant properties of pinned head - to - head transverse domain walls [ tdws , fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](a ) ] which arise in thin , narrow , in - plane magnetized strips @xcite .",
    "the tdws are pinned at triangular notches located at the edge of the strip .",
    "we use a numerical eigenmode method to study three tdw resonances , corresponding to translational@xcite , twisting@xcite and breathing @xcite excitations of the tdw .",
    "the latter mode has recently been studied for oscillator applications @xcite and we demonstrate that this mode has the lowest sensitivity to changes in notch depths , making it an appealing choice for device applications . the eigenmode method we use also enables us to study the modes in the vicinity of the static depinning field where we find a sharp drop off in the translational mode frequency .",
    "this dramatic change in frequency can be linked directly to the position - dependence of the slope of the notch - induced confining potential ( probed here by field - induced displacements of the tdw within the potential ) .",
    "many numerical studies of resonant modes in confined geometries use time domain ( ` ringdown ' ) methods in which fourier analysis of precessional magnetization dynamics is employed to extract resonant mode frequencies and spatial profiles .",
    "these methods require the system to be subjected to an external excitation @xcite , often a pulsed magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , eigenmode methods @xcite enable a direct calculation of resonant magnetic modes from a system s equilibrium magnetic configuration , @xmath0 ( as do dynamical matrix methods @xcite ) .",
    "this enables the observation of the full mode spectrum without requiring careful choice of the ringdown excitation s symmetry .",
    "it also enables us to study dw modes at fields which are in the close neighborhood of the static depinning field where excited translational resonances could otherwise resonantly depin@xcite the wall .",
    "our simulations were run on a permalloy strip having saturation magnetization @xmath1 ka / m and exchange stiffness @xmath2 pj / m using the finite element micromagnetic package finmag ( successor to nmag @xcite ) . the strip has tapered ends and two central notches for tdw pinning [ fig .

    "magnetic eigenmodes are determined from @xmath0 using a method which is similar to that described by daquino _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite  and which is valid for small time - dependent oscillations @xmath4 around @xmath0 .",
    "the basic principle is to linearize the llg equation around the equilibrium state @xmath0 , resulting in a linear system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the oscillations @xmath4 .",
    "this system of odes can be phrased as an eigenvalue problem for @xmath4 which has a full set of solutions representing the eigenmodes of the nanostrip .",
    "the complex coefficients of each solution vector encode the local amplitudes and relative phases of the eigenmode at the nodes of the finite element mesh .",
    "the algorithm computes a number of modes of increasing frequency , @xmath5 .",
    "each @xmath5 has a real and an imaginary part with the latter typically 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the former .",
    "we quote the real parts of @xmath5 . in theory ,",
    "the eigenfrequencies are purely real ; the small imaginary part stems from the formulation of the problem as a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem for which the eigensolver returns complex solutions with a small imaginary component due to numerical inaccuracies .",
    "eigenmodes localized at the tdw can be identified by visual inspection of the spatially resolved eigenvectors .",
    "either the dynamic component , @xmath4 , may be inspected alone or it can be scaled and added to @xmath0 , enabling a visualization of the actual tdw dynamics for each mode ( e.g.  see mode animations ) .    to find @xmath0 ,",
    "the system was initialized with a trial head - to - head tdw configuration centered on @xmath3 and allowed to relax with damping parameter @xmath6 , typically until @xmath7ns at all points in the strip . for a strip width of 75  nm and a thickness of 5  nm , using",
    "the stricter criterion @xmath8ns resulted in changes in the mode frequencies of 1.1 mhz or less ( @xmath9% ) .",
    "the relaxed configuration was a pinned tdw for all studied geometries @xcite .",
    "note that the tdw [ fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](a ) ] is wider at the @xmath10 side of the strip which will be important for determining tdw - notch interactions .",
    "we used a characteristic internode length for the finite element mesh of @xmath11  nm at @xmath3 ( less than the nife exchange length of 5.7 nm @xcite ) with a smooth transition to a larger @xmath12 nm at the ends of the strip to reduce computational time and memory use .",
    "as such , we present results only on those modes which are localized on the tdw near the center of the strip ) .",
    "we note that except for those simulations in which magnetic fields close to the dw depinning field are applied , the error in the mode frequency associated with the larger @xmath13 at the device ends was found to be less than 1% . a post - relaxation mesh coarsening@xcite",
    "could potentially be applied to future studies .",
    "finally , we note that a comparison with a time domain ringdown simulation is given in appendix [ ringdown ] .",

    "_ et al.__@xcite have observed what seem to be similar breathing and twisting modes of unpinned tdws . as shown below , and in contrast to what is observed for the translational mode , a finite frequency for the breathing and twisting modes is non - reliant on confinement ( i.e.  they are intrinsic @xmath19 tdw excitations ) .",
    "the translational and twisting modes both involve some movement of the tdw away from the energetically favorable @xmath3 position .",
    "this can either be a global side - to - side movement of the tdw ( as for the translational mode ) or a local side - to - side movement ( as for the twisting mode where out of phase lateral tdw movements arise at opposite edges of the strip ) .",
    "this has strong implications for notch sensitivity with the twisting and translational modes having a strong dependence on the notch size .",
    "in contrast , dynamics of the breathing mode are concentrated away from the notch at the tdw s edges which results in a much weaker sensitivity to the notch size .    to demonstrate this",

    "one will notice immediately that the twisting and translational modes ( i.e.  those with some translational nature ) are highly dependent on @xmath22 .",
    "the translational mode s frequency , @xmath23 , decreases smoothly with @xmath22 , going to zero at @xmath24 fig .",
    "[ f : notch](a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the wall being free to translate laterally at @xmath25 in the absence of pinning ( i.e.  @xmath24 corresponds to a smooth - edged strip with no notches ) .",
    "the twisting mode frequency , @xmath26 , also depends quite strongly on @xmath22 , reducing by @xmath2740% ( @xmath28 ghz ) when changing @xmath22 from 20 nm to 0 nm [ fig .",

    "[ fig : modes](b , d ) that both the twisting and translational modes dynamics are largest at the wide end of the tdw .",
    "this suggests that this end of the tdw has a weaker lateral confinement than the narrow end of the tdw .",

    "reducing @xmath22 from 10  nm to 2  nm at the narrow end of the wall [ filled circles in fig .",
    "[ f : notch](c ) ] generates a 40% reduction in @xmath23 .",
    "notably , this is accompanied by a transition to a more pure translation of the tdw structure in its entirety rather than an excitation in which the highest amplitude dynamics occur at the wide end of the tdw [ as in fig .",

    "this did lead to small changes in @xmath29 ( @xmath16 nm , @xmath15 nm ) with some distortion of the breathing mode observed when the notch was right at the edge of the tdw .",
    "however the maximum frequency change still remained within @xmath33% of the value observed for two laterally centered notches .",
    "we also looked at the percentage variation of @xmath29 for two other strip widths ( 60 nm and 100 nm wide 5 nm thick strips ) for centrally located notches .",
    "we found the lowest sensitivity for larger widths where the notch intrudes comparatively less far into the strip and thus presumably generates the weakest change to the energy landscape that is experienced by the tdw . reducing the thickness of the layer also led to a reduced sensitivity .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : checkbreathe](b ) where we again plot resonance data for 60 nm and 75 nm wide strips but this time with a reduced ( 2.5 nm ) strip thickness . an important point to note from fig .",
    "[ f : checkbreathe ] is that the breathing mode remains highly insensitive to changes in @xmath22 for small notches at all studied widths .",
    "we see the alrgest changes in @xmath29 when @xmath22 becomes larger than about 12 nm suggesting that small defects should have only a minor effect on the breathing mode .",
    "in contrast , the other two modes are least sensitive to changes in @xmath22 when @xmath22 is large ( fig .",
    "[ f : notch ] ) .",
    "we briefly note that changes in the _ width _ of the notch ( for a fixed notch depth of 10 nm ) yielded weak changes for both @xmath29 and @xmath26 . over a range of notch widths from 5 nm to 50 nm we observed @xmath34 % and @xmath35 % . the change in @xmath23 was also minor when reducing the notch width below 20 nm ( @xmath36 % ) .",
    "however , broadening the notch to 50 nm led to a strong reduction in @xmath23 of @xmath37 % , presumably due to a strongly reduced confinement by the broader notches ( the effect of confinement on @xmath23 is discussed further below ) .          when holding the notch geometry constant ( @xmath15 nm and @xmath16 nm ) , we find that increasing the strip width leads to an reduction in each of the tdw mode s frequencies [ fig .",
    "[ f : widths](a ) ] .",
    "the breathing and twisting modes remain highest in frequency and their similar frequencies , coupled with slightly different width dependencies , results in a mode crossing which occurs at @xmath38 nm for this 5 nm thick strip [ figs .",
    "[ f : widths](b ) ] . at @xmath39 , a translational mode as well as two other distinct tdw modes",
    "are found with the latter appearing as mixed twisting - breathing modes [ e.g.  fig .",
    "[ f : widths](c ) ] .",
    "analogous mixed modes were also calculated for a similar geometry using the mode solver in the spinflow3d simulation package ( some details on this solver have been given previously @xcite ) .",
    "this mode mixing can be clearly identified when visually inspecting the modes for @xmath40  nm . as @xmath41 increases ,",

    "[ f : widths](b ) , all modes at @xmath42  nm are labeled either as twisting or breathing with the label corresponding to the mode which is dominant .",
    "note that we expect no mode coupling in this eigenmode approach since this would require the inclusion of damping in the mode determination @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have found that the mixing arises due to the arbitrary basis chosen by the eigensolver : each mixed mode is a linear combination of the ` pure ' orthogonal twisting and breathing eigenmodes ( appendix [ mixing ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the width dependence of the translational mode which will be shown to be linked to the width - dependence of the notch - induced confinement of the tdw .",

    "the twisting and translational modes both involve either local or global lateral translation of the wall structure within the notch - induced pinning potential .",
    "this leads to a clear sensitivity to changes in the intrusion depth of the notches especially to that of the notch at the narrow end of the tdw structure which has a dominant role in laterally confining the tdw .",

    "for example , when varying the notch intrusion depth from 0 to 20 nm , the largest change in the mode s frequency was 3% ( observed for the narrowest strip width of 60 nm ) .",
    "the sensitivity could be further reduced by using a thin or wide strip .",
    "these results may be relevant when choosing which tdw mode to exploit in dw oscillators or when aiming to individually or simultaneously excite ( multiple ) dws pinned at different positions within a strip ( e.g. in shift registers)@xcite .",

    "for the translational mode , the width dependence could be reproduced with a spring model for the notch - induced tdw confinement .",
    "indeed , the eigenmode method ( which does _ not _ rely on the forced driving of the tdw s resonant dynamics over time ) allowed us to determine the translational mode frequencies over a wide range of fields , including in the close vicinity of the static depinning field where the translational mode frequency drops sharply towards zero . at low fields and thus low tdw displacements , the notch - induced confining potential",
    "was found to be parabolic , enabling us to analytically reproduce the simulated translational mode frequency at zero field . at large fields and large displacements",
    "however , the growth of the pinning potential s energy with displacement was found to be sub - parabolic . here",
    "the spring model could however still be used to reproduce the translational mode frequencies as long as the local slope of the pinning potential was used to calculate the spring constant .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath23 is finite only in the presence of confinement .",
    "in contrast , @xmath29 and @xmath26 remain large and finite even without a notch or close to depinning , suggesting that they correspond to intrinsic localized tdw excitations which do albeit show some degree of sensitivity to the presence of notches .",

    "fourier analysis of the ringdown dynamics at a strip width of 80 nm demonstrated excitation of the translational and breathing modes at @xmath93 ghz and @xmath94 ghz , in good agreement with the eigenmode results ( @xmath95 ghz and @xmath96 ghz for @xmath97 nm as per fig .",

    "to demonstrate that each mixed mode is a linear combination of the ` pure ' orthogonal twisting and breathing eigenmodes , we let @xmath99 be the ` mixed mode ' eigenvectors as returned by the solver ( their complex entries encode the amplitude and relative phase of the magnetization oscillations at each mesh node ) . to show that these can be reduced to the ` pure ' modes we need to find complex scalars @xmath100 such that the linear combination @xmath101 represents a breathing / twisting mode .",
    "the breathing mode is characterized by being fully symmetric about the @xmath55-axis , i.e.  the oscillations in the left and right half of the nanostrip are out of phase by @xmath102 : @xmath103 .",
    "the expression @xmath104 thus measures the deviation from symmetry for an eigenmode @xmath105 and we can find the ` most symmetric ' linear combination by minimizing this with respect to @xmath100 . since each eigenvector is only determined up to a scalar , we can assume that @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 ) , reducing the dimensionality of the optimization problem .",

    "the general trend of decreasing @xmath26 with @xmath70 for fixed notch geometry is qualitatively consistent with a string - like mode that is confined across the strip having a single node in the strip s center ( i.e.  with wavelength @xmath109 and thus a frequency @xmath110 ) .",
