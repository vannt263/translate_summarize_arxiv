    "point defects drastically affect the performance of semiconductor devices . in particular , they can act as charge traps and/or recombination centers . in electronic applications , such as in high - electron mobility transistors ,",
    "charge traps deteriorate the performance of the device and can lead to so - called device dispersion.@xcite in most cases charge trapping , or capture , occurs nonradiatively , i.e. , without the emission of a photon . in optoelectronic applications , such as in light - emitting diodes or photovoltaic cells , defects can act as recombination centers for charge carriers .",
    "this so - called shockley - read - hall ( srh ) recombination @xcite is detrimental , as it decreases the efficiency of the device .",
    "srh recombination can also affect electronic devices that rely on minority carrier transport , e.g. , bipolar transistors .",
    "srh recombination is a sequence of two carrier capture processes : one carrier is captured , and then the other carrier recombines with it .",
    "@xcite for both charge traps and recombination centers , the important question is : what are the carrier capture coefficients ( cross sections ) ?    for deep centers the nonradiative carrier",
    "capture occurs via multiphonon emission ( mpe ) .",
    "@xcite the main idea behind mpe is that the transition between the delocalized bulk state and the localized defect state can occur within the first order of electron - phonon coupling because of a large local lattice relaxation associated with the change of the charge state of the defect .",
    "@xcite the phonon selection rule @xmath0 is relieved , and emission of more than one phonon becomes possible .",
    "many researchers have contributed to the theoretical foundations of mpe over the past six decades . @xcite",
    "these investigations have revealed that the results of calculations are extremely sensitive to ( i ) the adopted theoretical model and ( ii ) the details of the electronic structure of the defect , with different approaches yielding variations of capture coefficients over many orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite    concerning aspect ( i ) , earlier theoretical works @xcite have made it clear that there is no single theoretical model that is valid in _ all _ cases .",
    "a number of factors have to be considered in choosing the appropriate description , @xcite including the hierarchy of different time scales ( carrier capture times vs.  phonon lifetimes and periods of lattice vibrations ) , the strength of electron - phonon coupling ( linear vs.  higher - order coupling schemes ) , the choice of a good starting point for perturbation theory ( electron and phonon wavefunctions ) , and the number of different phonon modes that have to be considered .",
    "this choice of description has to be considered for each type of defect individually , a practice we will follow in the current paper as well .    aspect ( ii ) , i.e. , incomplete knowledge of the atomic and electronic structure of the defect , turned out to be an equally important issue",
    ". if this structure is not known , not only does it affect the result within a given theoretical model , but it impedes the choice of the correct model itself .",
    "aspect ( ii ) is thus closely linked to aspect ( i ) . when the objective was to understand general trends and interpret experimental findings , calculations based on models that did not take the specifics of the atomic and the electronic structure into account were often very successful .",
    "an example of such work is the seminal paper of henry and lang @xcite on nonradiative carrier capture in gap and gaas , semiconductors with room - temperature band gaps of 2.22 and 1.42 ev,@xcite respectively .",
    "the authors theoretically determined the temperature dependence of capture cross sections and provided an estimate of the range of high - temperature asymptotic values of these cross sections . using a semi - classical description of carrier capture",
    ", they could explain the exponential dependence of cross sections on temperature for many defects in both gaas and gap , which proved that for these systems carrier capture was indeed due to multiphonon emission . however , their model was unable to offer specific predictions for individual defects , and provided little insight into exceptions to the general trends .",
    "in addition , these as well as other early calculations required empirical input as well as drastic simplifications regarding the local electronic structure and the nature of relevant lattice vibrations .",
    "this seriously limited the predictive power , especially for applications to new materials .    with the advent of accurate electronic structure methods , mostly based on density",
    "functional theory ( dft ) and related techniques , the situation is very different now .",
    "@xcite state - of - the - art approaches , such as hybrid functionals , provide a very good description of both bulk band gaps and localized defect states .",
    "@xcite the availability of these methods , combined with the general knowledge of mpe acquired over the past six decades , raises the question whether nonradiative carrier capture rates can now be determined completely from first principles , allowing them to be used predictively , and whether such calculations can expand our insights into the _ physics _ of defects .",

    "some progress has already been made in this area .",
    "schanovsky and co - workers studied nonradiative hole trapping at defects in sio@xmath1 and addressed the vibrational part of the problem using first - principles calculations , @xcite but actual values of the electron - phonon matrix elements remained undetermined .",

    "shi and wang @xcite were the first to address both the vibrational and the electron - phonon part of the carrier - capture problem completely from electronic structure calculations .",
    "they presented an algorithm to calculate electron - phonon matrix elements at defects , and applied the methodology to study hole capture at the zn@xmath2-@xmath3 complex in gan . despite some important contributions",
    ", this study also had some limitations .",

    "these considerations indicate that the comparison of carrier capture characteristics of different defects in different materials should be approached with caution .",
    "however , some conclusions can still be drawn .",
    "let us consider a specific material , and look at carrier capture cross sections for a wide range of defects .",
    "those cross sections will depend on the specific defect , as well as on temperature .",
    "however , one could argue that the maximum value of capture cross section across all defects and across all temperature ranges ( say , for temperatures where non - degenerate carrier statistics apply ) , would be indicative of the strength of electron - phonon coupling in the host material .",
    "in their seminal paper , henry and lang studied capture cross sections at defects in gap and gaas .",
    "@xcite the measurements were performed by deep - level transient spectroscopy over the temperature range 100 - 600 k , comparable to the temperature range discussed in the present work .",
    "both electron and hole capture was studied .",
    "capture cross sections at various defects ranged from @xmath32 to about @xmath280 @xmath33 for these temperatures .",
    "one could cautiously conclude that @xmath197@xmath280 @xmath33 is the maximum capture cross section for any defect system in gap and gaas .",
    "for the three defects studied in the present work , calculated hole capture cross sections vary from 0.1 to 200 @xmath35 in gan ( figs .",
    "[ c - nonrad ] and [ znga - vn - nonrad ] ) , and from 1000 to 2000 @xmath33 in zno ( fig .",
    "[ li - nonrad ] ) for a similar temperature range .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath281 @xmath33 in gan : c@xmath6 at @xmath4=@xmath282 k , and @xmath283 @xmath33 for zno : li@xmath7 at @xmath284 k. as discussed in sec .  [ res ] , these results are in agreement with the experimental data of ref .   .",
    "while our data set is limited , it is clear that carrier capture cross sections in zno and gan tend to be larger than those in gap and gaas .",
    "we attribute this to the larger strength of electron - phonon interactions in wide - band - gap materials such as gan and zno , compared to gap and gaas .",
    "this strength directly affects the matrix elements , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ e - ph7 ] .",
    "these trends for nonradiative capture at defects are in accord with the knowledge of electron - phonon interactions in _ bulk _ solids .",
    "let us take the interaction of free carriers with longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons as an example .",
    "this strength of this interaction can be characterized by a dimensionless factor , the frhlich parameter @xmath285 ( in si units).@xcite for holes , @xmath286 in gaas and @xmath287 in gap , while @xmath288 is about 1.0 in gan and 1.5 in zno , indeed indicative of stronger interaction .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a first - principles methodology to study nonradiative carrier capture by means of multiphonon emission at defects in semiconductors .",
    "all the parameters , including the electron - phonon coupling , have been determined consistently using hybrid density functional calculations , which yield accurate bulk band structures as well as defect properties .",
    "significant simplifications occur due to the implementation of a 1d model , for which we provided extensive justification , and which also yields useful insights into the defect physics .",
    "we applied our methodology to several hole - capturing centers in gan and zno .",
    "the resulting capture coefficients are large , and in agreement with experimental data .",
    "we conclude that state - of - the - art electronic structure techniques , when combined with reliable methodological approaches , are capable of accurately describing carrier capture processes .",
    "the methodology thus allows generating reliable information for defects for which experimental information is incomplete  which seems to be the case for the majority of defects that are potentially relevant for charge trapping or srh recombination in semiconductor devices . the combination of a first - principles approach with experiment can also be a powerful aid in the identification of defects",
    "finally , our first - principles approach allows making predictions for new materials for which no experimental data is as yet available .",
