    "<S> we demonstrate that the dubna - mainz - taipei ( dmt ) meson - exchange dynamical model , which starts from an effective chiral lagrangian , for pion photoproduction provides an excellent and economic framework to describe both the @xmath0 threshold production and the @xmath1 deformation , two features dictated by chiral dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the low - energy qcd is the chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry is expected to show up in the parity doubling of all hadronic states ( winer - weyl mode ) , e.g. , the proton with @xmath2 would have a @xmath3 partner . </S>",
    "<S> this is not observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> instead the symmetry is broken spontaneously ( nambu - goldstone mode ) which leads to the appearance of massless pseudoscalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite parity partner of the proton is a proton plus a `` massless pion '' .    </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) has led to the development of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , a low - energy effective field theory of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> it utilizes the concept of scsb and replaces the quark and gluon fields by a set of fields describing the degrees of freedom of the observed hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> there is generally good agreement between the chpt predictions and experiments@xcite , including the @xmath0 photoproduction near threshold where very precise measurements have been performed and the chpt calculation to one loop @xmath4 has been carried out in the heavy - baryon formulation@xcite .    the fact that opposite parity partner of the proton is a proton plus a pion leads to the consequence that the @xmath5 interaction in momentum space takes the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nucleon spin and pion momentum , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this strong @xmath9-wave @xmath5 interaction gives rise to the @xmath1 resonance and its deformation@xcite , which has been observed in pion photoproduction .    in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> , i will present a meson - exchange dynamical model for pion photoproduction we recently developed in a collaboration between groups at dubna , mainz , and taipei ( dmt)@xcite which can describe well the pion - photoproduction data from threshold to the first resonance region , including the @xmath0 threshold production and @xmath1 deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the dmt dynamical model also starts from an effective chiral lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian is then used to construct a potential for use in the scattering equation . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of the scattering equation will include rescattering effects to all orders and thereby unitarity is ensured .    in a dynamical model for pion photoproduction@xcite , the @xmath10-matrix </S>",
    "<S> is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 transition potential , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath5 free propagator and @xmath10 matrix , respectively , and @xmath16 is the total energy in the c.m . frame . </S>",
    "<S> physical multipole amplitude in channel @xmath17 then reads as@xcite @xmath18,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the @xmath5 phase shift , reaction matrix in channel @xmath17 , total cm energy of momentum @xmath23 , and principal value integral , respectively ; @xmath24 is the photon momentum and @xmath25 the pion on - shell momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath15 are obtained in a meson - exchange @xmath5 model@xcite constructed in the bethe - salpeter formalism and solved within cooper - jennings reduction scheme . at low energies where resonances play little role , only background part , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are derived from an effective lagrangian containing born terms and @xmath28 and @xmath29 exchanges in the @xmath10 channel , contribute .    for @xmath0 photoproduction from proton </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the multipole @xmath30 near threshold by solving the following coupled channels equation within a basis with physical pion and nucleon masses . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to the following expression in @xmath31 channel : @xmath32 the @xmath5 @xmath10-matrices are obtained by solving the coupled channels equation for @xmath5 scattering using the meson - exchange model@xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the prediction of dmt model for @xmath33 obtained without and with isospin symmetry assumption , are shown in dashed and solid curves , respectively , and compared with heavy - baryon chpt results ( dash - dotted curve)@xcite . agreement of dmt prediction with the data    and chpt results are excellent .    the polarized linear photon asymmetry @xmath34 has been found to be very sensitive to small @xmath9-wave multipoles@xcite . dmt model ( solid curve ) is not able to reproduce the data at @xmath35 mev , of ref . , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , while chpt calculation of @xmath4 with six low - energy constants ( dashed curve ) is seen to be able to describe the experiment reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> however , preliminary analysis of a new measurement at mainz@xcite seems to agree with dmt s prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the issue of the @xmath36 deformation . in a symmetric su(6 ) quark model , @xmath1 is in @xmath37 state and spherical . </S>",
    "<S> the photo - excitation of the @xmath1 could then proceed only via @xmath38 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a @xmath39 state in the @xmath1 has the consequence that the @xmath1 is deformed and the photon can excite a nucleon through electric @xmath40 quadrupole transition . in pion photoproduction , @xmath40 excitation would give rise to nonvanishing @xmath41 multipole amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments give @xmath42@xcite , a clear indication of @xmath1 deformation .    in the ( 3,3 ) channel where @xmath1 excitation plays an important role , </S>",
    "<S> the transition potential @xmath12 consists of two terms @xmath43 where second term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tranpot ] ) corresponds to the contribution of bare @xmath1 , namely , @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we may then write    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by combining the contributions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 and using the bare @xmath50 coupling constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath38 and @xmath40 transitions as free parameters , results of our best fit to the resonant multipoles @xmath53 and @xmath41 obtained in the analyses of mainz@xcite and vpi group@xcite are shown in fig . 3 by solid curves . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curves denote the contribution from @xmath48 only . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted curves represented the @xmath54-matrix approximation to @xmath48 , namely , without the principal value integral term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) included .    for @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> , one sees a large effect of the pion off - shell rescattering ( difference between dotted and dashed curves ) , which results from the principal value integral part of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total pion rescattering ( dashed curves ) contributes for half of the @xmath53 as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 while the remaining half originates from the bare @xmath55 excitation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one sees that almost all of the @xmath40 strength is generated by the @xmath5 rescattering .    at the resonance position @xmath48 vanishes within @xmath54-matrix approximation and only principal value integral term survives . </S>",
    "<S> the latter corresponds to the contribution where @xmath1 is excited by the pion produced via @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the addition of this contribution to @xmath57 can be considered as a dressing of the @xmath55 vertex . for @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> the dominance of background and pion rescattering contributions leads to a very small bare value for electric transition . </S>",
    "<S> we hence conclude that bare @xmath1 is almost spherical and the deformation observed experimentally arises mostly from the long - range effect of the pion cloud , a manifestation of chiral dynamics .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the dmt meson - exchange dynamical model for pion photoproduction , which starts from an chiral effective lagrangian , provides an excellent and economical framework in describing threshold @xmath0 production and @xmath1 deformation , two key consequences of chiral dynamics . </S>"
