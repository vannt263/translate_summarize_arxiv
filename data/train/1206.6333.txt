    "we are going to study de universe filled with fluid log parametrization and asss parametrization respectively which have not been studied before so extensively .",
    "as we went through the literature we came to know that apart from the cosmological constant ( @xmath44 ) , the sinehyperbolic scalar field potential ( sahni , v. and starobinsky , a.a 2000 ; urena - lopez , l.a . and",

    "the parameters of this fitting function are determined by matching to supernova observations .",
    "now , one can manage to reconstruct the functional form of @xmath11 by taking an ansatz of the luminosity distance or @xmath46 and then by comparing it to supernova observations . + this model is based on the following ansatz : @xmath47 which can be equivalently written as following : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the critical density at present time and @xmath51 dimensionless density of dark energy .",

    "al . have shown if they calculate the bayes factor then most of the data catalogues supports the fact that cpl , jbp are significantly disfavored with respect to simple @xmath57 model ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "now , linear parametrization is not to be considered in such a case as the parametrization blows with high @xmath58 .",

    "these observational supports substantiate our interest of working with asss model .",

    "following hawking s idea , the temperature associated with the apparent horizon is : @xmath207 where @xmath208 is surface gravity of the apparent horizon and given by ; @xmath209 .    hence",
    ", the temperature associated with apparent horizon is @xmath210 .",
    "with k=0 , using equation ( [ 5 ] ) we obtain @xmath211 to determine the validity of first law thermodynamics we first calculate the energy crossing over this apparent horizon in an infinitesimal dt time which comes out to be ( bousso , r. 2006 ) @xmath212 on the apparent horizon , the entropy is : @xmath213 hence the following holds : @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 hence the first law of thermodynamics holds on apparent horizon independent of how we are gon na model @xmath11 .    now , using gibbs equation we get ( izquirdo , g. and pavon d. 2006 ) @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 are entropy and enrgy density respectively inside the apparent horizon and @xmath219 is given by @xmath220 and the volume bounded by the apparent horizon is @xmath221 therefore using equation ( [ 68]),([69 ] ) and ( [ 70 ] ) , we get @xmath222 rewriting the last equation and using the expression for @xmath223,we get @xmath224 hence holds the generalized second law of thermodynamics if we consider apparent horizon and the volume bounded by it .",
    "so the result holds not only for two types of fluid we have discussed in the paper , but also for every fluid obeying @xmath225 which is in quite agreement with ( mazumder , n. et .",
    "al . 2010 ) .",
    "the event horizon @xmath226 is defined to be @xmath227 hence the event horizon has a hawking s temperature of @xmath228 which yields @xmath229 it follows that : @xmath230 note @xmath231 is the marginal point of strong energy condition which is @xmath232 .",
    "+ employing similar technique we would get , ( xing , l. et . al . 2011 ) @xmath233\\frac{-1}{\\left(1+z\\right)h}\\ ] ] changing the variable to @xmath234 we get ; @xmath235\\frac{1}{ah}\\ ] ] + evidently @xmath236 is not necessarily positive for any allowed value of @xmath58 ( as we have @xmath237 in the expression ) which , in turn , implies that the second law of thermodynamics breaks down inside the event horizon in quite agreement with xing , l. et .",
    "so far we have studied the thermodynamics of universe from two different models .",
    "it has been revealed that the first model where @xmath112 does not go through any critical point . in this model universe started with a high ( fig . 1 , 2 , 3 ) energy density , pressure and temperature which falls as @xmath58 becomes @xmath82 from @xmath81.we imposed restriction on allowed values of @xmath83 and @xmath40 by demanding @xmath238 . the thermal capacity at constant volume changes sign as @xmath8 becomes smaller than @xmath59 , but this transition is smooth without having critical point .",
    "unlike mcg or gcg here pressure depends both on temperature and volume in thermal eos . from equation ( [ 20 ] ) we have shown it is possible to have @xmath239 irrespective of model to ascertain a stable universe .",
    "thereafter we have generalized the results for a general eos parameter .",
    "we have shown that energy density takes the same form as a function of temperature and volume irrespective of model with a general limiting behavior of thermodynamic parameter ( [ 57.11 ] ) to satisfy third law of thermodynamics .",
    "we have also interpreted @xmath2 as a measure of number of micro states and argued for it natural plausibility ( [ 57.3 ] ) and ( [ 57.4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is intriguing to note that the thermal eos ( [ 57 ] ) looks like ideal gas eos in some way .",
    "also we have determined the asymptotic behavior of @xmath172 such that third law of thermodynamics holds .",
    "it has been shown that the first and second law of thermodynamics hold on apparent horizon not only for our model but also for any model having @xmath225 .",
    "they fail to be valid on event horizon unless @xmath8 takes a specific value which is in perfect agreement with ( mazumder , n. et .",
    "; xing , l. et .",
    "al . 2011 ) .",
    "one important aspect which have been followed in this paper is a try to speculate the instabilities .",
    "considering , the thermodynamical point at which the heat capacity changes its sign , as a transition point we have followed that the point is nothing but the phantom barrier in the case of log parametrization .",
    "even there we can find the squared sound speed turns out to be negative",
    ". even for asss such point arises for negative @xmath58 , theoretically indicating to some future point .",
    "we have also explored the possibility of the fact that at our indicated points small density perturbation will occur such that the fundamental phenomenon like the propagation of sound does not take place at all .",
