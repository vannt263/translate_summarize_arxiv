    "the simplicity of analytic formulae for tidal spin down of spherical bodies and the associated drift rate in semi - major axis @xcite has made it possible to estimate tidal spin - down rates in diverse settings , including stars , exoplanets , satellites , and asteroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , there is uncertainty in how to estimate the spin down rate and associated semi - major axis drift of non - spherical bodies ( though see @xcite for estimates of tidal drift rates for two extended homogeneous bodies ) and this hampers attempts to interpret the dynamical history of systems that include extended spinning bodies like pluto s and haumea s satellite systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an extended shape might experience enhanced tidal distortion and dissipation compared to a stronger spherical body .",
    "@xcite suggested that use of the radius of an object with equivalent volume ( the volumetric radius ) in classic tidal formulae could lead to an underestimate of the tidal torque on haumea .",
    "a semi - analytical treatment of the gravitational potential inside a triaxial homogeneous body can give a description of instantaneous internal deformations ( or displacements ) and stresses as a function of cartesian coordinates @xcite . if the axes of the tidal force lie along planes of body symmetry , the displacements depend on 12 dimensionless coefficients that can be computed numerically .",
    "however , analytical computation in the general case is more challenging .",
    "`` the reader is cautioned that in the general case where the tide - raising object does not lie along a principal axis , as many as 72 unknown coefficients may appear . ''",
    "@xcite . to semi - analytically compute the tidal torque for a spinning triaxial body we would need to numerically compute all these coefficients and then average over body rotation to compute secular or average drift rates .    due to the complexity of accurate semi - analytical computation , it would be convenient to have scaling relations , dependent on body axis ratios , that would allow one to obtain correct analytical formulae for tidal evolution from the well known one for homogeneous spherical bodies .",
    "our goal here is to numerically measure such correction factors using numerical simulations .",
    "because of their simplicity and speed , compared to more computationally intensive grid - based or finite element methods , mass - spring computations are an attractive method for simulating deformable bodies . by including spring damping forces",
    ", they can be used to model viscoelastic deformation .",
    "we previously used a mass - spring model to study tidal encounters @xcite and measure tidal spin down for spherical bodies over a range of viscoelastic relaxation timescales @xcite .",
    "mass spring models are not restricted to spherical particle distributions and so can be used to study triaxial ellipsoids .",
    "our work @xcite compared orbital semi - major axis drift rates for spherical bodies to those predicted analytically .",
    "here we use the same type of simulations to measure drift rates but work in a setting where analytical computations are lacking and the numerical measurements may motivate order of magnitude scaling arguments .",
    "to simulate tidal viscoelastic response we use the mass - spring model by @xcite that is built on the modular n - body code rebound @xcite .",
    "springs between mass nodes are damped and so approximate the behavior of a kelvin - voigt viscoelastic solid with poisson ratio of 1/4 @xcite . as done previously @xcite , we consider a binary in a circular orbit , with a spinning body resolved with masses and springs .",
    "the other body ( the tidal perturber ) is modeled as a point mass .",
    "the particles are subjected to three types of forces : the gravitational forces acting on every pair of particles in the body and with a massive companion , and the elastic and damping spring forces acting only between sufficiently close particle pairs .",
    "springs have a spring constant @xmath5 and a damping rate parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the number density of springs , spring constants and spring lengths set the shear modulus , @xmath7 , whereas the spring damping rate , @xmath6 , allows one to adjust the shear viscosity , @xmath8 , and viscoelastic relaxation time , @xmath9 . for a poisson ratio of 1/4 , the young s or elastic modulus @xmath10 .",
    "the tidally induced spin down rate is computed from the drift rate of the semi - major axis measured in the simulations .",
    "@xcite measured a 30% difference between the drift rate computed from the simulations and that computed analytically .",
    "we do not try to resolve this discrepancy here but instead compare the orbital drift rate of homogeneous triaxial ellipsoids to that of a spherical body with the same mass and volume , assuming that the cause of the discrepancy is not strongly dependent on body shape or simulated rheology .",
    "we consider an extended spherical body of mass @xmath11 , tidally deformed by a point mass perturber of mass @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the two body system with @xmath11 and @xmath12 in a circular orbit with orbital semi - major axis @xmath13 and mean motion @xmath14 .",
    "the body @xmath11 spins with spin rate @xmath15 and its spin axis is orientated parallel to the orbital angular momentum vector . here",
    "@xmath16 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we use @xmath13 to denote orbital semi - major axis so as to differentiate it from body ellipsoid semi - major axis , @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 .    for spherical bodies and for the simulations described by @xcite we worked with mass in units of @xmath11 , distances in units of radius @xmath19 , time in units of @xmath20 and elastic modulus in units of @xmath21 which scales with the gravitational energy density or central pressure .",
    "for a non - spherical homogeneous ellipsoid body we could replace the radius @xmath19 with the body s semi - major axis length , @xmath17 , or we could use the volumetric radius , @xmath22 , the radius of a spherical body with the same volume .",
    "the volumetric radius was used by @xcite to study the energy dissipation rate of wobbling and rotating ellipsoids . for oblate systems we could use the mean equatorial radius , @xmath23 .",
    "we chose the volumetric radius so that it is straightforward to compare simulations with the same number of mass - particles and simulated material properties ( shear modulus , shear viscosity , viscoelastic relaxation time and type of spring network ) . for our triaxial ellipsoids we work with mass in units of @xmath11 , distances in units of volumetric radius @xmath22 , time in units of @xmath24 and elastic modulus @xmath25 in units of @xmath26",
    "our choice of units implies that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the ellipsoid spins about a principal body axis , about its axis of maximum moment of inertia , and with spin axis orientated in the same direction as the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "our convention for body semi - axis ratios is @xmath29 with @xmath30 oriented along body spin and orbital spin axes .",
    "the volume of a triaxial ellipsoid is @xmath31 so a sphere with the same volume has radius of @xmath32    we run two types of mass spring models , a random spring model , ( as we described previously ; @xcite ) and a cubic lattice model ; for simulation snap shots see figure [ fig : snap ] . for the random spring model ,",
    "particle positions are drawn from an isotropic uniform distribution but only accepted into the spring network if they are within the surface , @xmath33 , and if they are more distant than @xmath34 from every other previously generated particle .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the minimum inter - particle spacing . for the cubic lattice model ,",
    "particle positions are generated in 3-dimensions at cartesian coordinates , within the ellipsoidal body surface , that are separated in @xmath35 or @xmath36 by @xmath34 .",
    "the cubic lattice cell is aligned with the @xmath37-axis , the direction between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the @xmath36-axis , aligned with the orbital and body spin axes and the @xmath38-axis along the tangential orbital motion .",
    "crystalline lattices are not elastically isotropic as their stiffness depends on the direction on which stress is applied .",
    "a cubic lattice was chosen because its elastic behavior is the same along @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath36 planes .",
    "an advantage of a lattice model is that the spring network is more homogeneous ( has less granularity or porosity ) and",
    "so can be run with shorter springs and fewer springs per node and this would reduce the affect of a weaker surface layer ( due to fewer springs per node near the surface ) .",
    "the advantage of the random spring model is that its stiffness should not be sensitive to the direction on which stress is applied ; it should be elastically isotropic .",
    "once the particle positions have been generated , every pair of particles within @xmath39 of each other are connected with a single spring .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is the maximum rest length of any spring . for the cubic lattice we chose @xmath39 so that cubic cell face diagonals and cubic cell cross diagonals are connected ( see figure 1 by @xcite for an illustration ) . for the random spring model we chose @xmath39 so that the number of springs per node is greater than 15 , as recommended by @xcite .    at the beginning of the simulation",
    "the body is not exactly in equilibrium because springs are initially set to their rest lengths .",
    "the body initially vibrates . as a result we run the simulation for a time @xmath40 with a higher damping rate @xmath41 .",
    "we only measure the semi - major axis drift rate using measurements taken after the high damping rate is finished and the body is relaxed and in equilibrium .",
    "the body is a permanent triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "the ellipticity of the body is not due to its rotation .",
    "the secular part of the semi - diurnal ( @xmath42 ) term in the fourier expansion of the perturbing potential ( e.g. , see appendix by @xcite ) gives a torque on a spherical body @xmath43 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "when the inclination and eccentricity are small , conservation of angular momentum gives an estimate of the secular drift rate of the semi - major axis from the secularly averaged torque @xmath44 where the tidal frequency @xmath45 .",
    "the quality function is @xmath46 and is often approximated as @xmath47 with @xmath48 a tidal dissipation factor ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath49 a love number . at low orbital eccentricity @xmath50",
    "gains a term that is proportional to the square of eccentricity ( cf equation 3 by @xcite based on @xcite ) . for low values of @xmath51 with @xmath52 the viscoelastic relaxation timescale and a stiff homogeneous elastic spherical body @xmath53 ( taking the low @xmath54 limit of equation 25 by @xcite for the kelvin - voigt viscoelastic model ) where @xmath7 is the shear modulus or rigidity .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath55 in the high rigidity limit for a homogeneous and incompressible elastic sphere @xcite and tidal dissipation factor @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is density and @xmath58 is surface gravitational acceleration .",
    "the semi - major axis drift rate , @xmath59 , is proportional to the tidally induced torque @xmath60 following from angular momentum conservation .",
    "we compare the orbital drift rate for bodies with the same mass and volume but different ellipsoid axis ratios .",
    "common parameters for the simulations are listed in table [ tab : common ] .",
    "three series are run , the c , r and lr series , with parameters listed in [ tab : series ] .",
    "c and r series simulations have similar numbers of particles but the c series has a cubic lattice model .",
    "r and lr series are random lattice spring models , with the lr series having more particles than the r series .",
    "each simulation series has parameters similar or the same as given in tables [ tab : common ] and [ tab : series ] but individual simulations within the series have different body axis ratios .",
    "for comparison we measure @xmath61 , the semi - major axis drift rate , for a spherical body in the same series , with values listed in table [ tab : series ] , and use it to normalize the semi - major axis drift rates for the non - spherical bodies .",
    "thus the semi - major axis drift rates for the cubic lattice simulations are divided by that of the spherical cubic lattice simulation and the semi - major axis drift rate for the random spring model simulations are divided by that of the similar spherical random simulation .",
    "a fairly low value of the young s modulus ( in units of @xmath62 ) was used so that the body was soft , reducing the integration time required to measure a drift in orbital semi - major axis .",
    "the frequency @xmath54 was chosen to be 0.1 ( significantly less than 1 ) so that we remain in the linear viscoelastic regime ( e.g. , see @xcite ) where the quality function and tidal torque are linearly proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "the simulations were run 200 times the period associated with the semi - diurnal frequency or for a total time @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "this length of time is chosen so that we can average over variations caused by body rotation and compute a secular drift rate in orbital semi - major axis .",
    "each simulation in the r and c series required a few hours of computation time on a 2.4 ghz intel core 2 duo from 2010 .    for both c series",
    "cubic lattice and r series random lattice models , we ran simulations of oblate and prolate systems with axis ratios @xmath650.4 to 1 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "the normalized orbital semi - major axis drift rates @xmath66 are shown in figures [ fig : oblate ] and [ fig : prolate ] for oblate and prolate bodies . for the r series random spring model we also ran a series of triaxial systems and their drift rates",
    "are shown in figures [ fig : tri ] and [ fig : tri_pr ] .",
    "the lr series is similar to the r series but contains more particles and is used to test the accuracy of the random spring models .",

    "spin rate , gravitational timescale , @xmath69 and energy density scale , @xmath62 , are computed using the volumetric radius and equations [ eqn : tgrav ] and [ eqn : eg ] .",
    "the spin rate was computed using the spin period @xmath70 hours measured by @xcite .",
    "the dwarf planet haumea @xcite is an extremely fast rotator with density higher than other objects in the kuiper belt ; it is consistent with a body dominated by rock @xcite .",
    "visible and infrared light curve fits @xcite find the body consistent with a rapidly rotating oblong jacobi ellipsoid shape in hydrostatic equilibrium with axis ratios listed in table [ tab : haumea ] ( also see @xcite ) and a density of @xmath71  g  @xmath72 . for discussion on formation scenarios for the satellite system see @xcite .",
    "parameters based on haumea and hiiaka are listed in table [ tab : haumea ] .",
    "the pressures in the body at depth for a body as massive as haumea would lead to ductile flow giving long - term deformation allowing the body to approach a figure of equilibrium ( a jacobi ellipsoid ) .",
    "even if haumea s shape is consistent with a hydrostatic equilibrium figure , on short timescales the body should behave elastically . for tidal evolution ,",
    "the relevant tidal frequency is @xmath73hz , comparable to vibrational normal mode frequencies in the earth . our simulations do not allow ductile flow on long timescales , but can approximate the faster tidal deformations if we model the body as a stiff elastic body with its current shape .",
    "we ran a simulation in the lr random lattice series with axis ratios @xmath74 and @xmath75 , consistent with measurements for haumea .",
    "the lr series of simulations has more particles than the r series and is discussed in more detail in section [ ap : num ] . from the simulation we measure @xmath76 or drift rate approximately twice that of the equivalent volume sphere .",
    "equation [ eqn : tri_line ] predicts a value 2.034 , consistent with the numerical measurement , whereas equation [ eqn : scale_tri ] gives 2.39 . in their section 4.3.1 , @xcite speculated that using the volumetric radius leads to an underestimate of the tidal evolution .",
    "however for the axis ratio of haumea @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we find here that the drift rate would only be about twice as fast as estimated using the volumetric radius .     and",
    "@xmath79 , similar to haumea .",
    "the blue points show a simulation of a homogeneous body , whereas the black points show a simulation with weaker ends ( where springs have a lower spring constant ) , mimicking a rocky body with icy ends .",
    "the lines show linear fits measuring the secular drift rate .",
    "the @xmath37 axis shows time in units of @xmath69 ( equation [ eqn : tgrav ] ) and the @xmath38 axis shows semi - major axis in units of volumetric radius , @xmath22 , measured from the initial value .",
    "the drift rate of the body with soft ends is about 5.2 times faster than the homogeneous ellipsoid with the same axis ratios and about 10 times faster than the equivalent volume homogeneous sphere .",
    "[ fig : icy],width=316 ]    @xcite proposed that stresses between icy shell and core and associated relaxation would cause ice to accumulate at the ends of haumea .",
    "he proposed that the icy ends could separate forming the two icy satellites namaka and hiiaka .",
    "estimates for the fraction of ice in a differentiated haumea range from 7% @xcite to 30% @xcite .",
    "young s modulus of ice is estimated to be a few gpa ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) and this is about 10 times lower than the young s modulus for rocky materials . to explore the affect of softer icy ends on the semi - major axis drift rate , we ran a simulation of a body that is not homogeneous . using the same axis ratios of @xmath74 and @xmath75 and parameters of the lr series",
    ", we reduced the spring constants to 1/10th the value in the body core at radii greater than 1 ( in units of volumetric radius ) from the body center .",
    "about 20% of the springs have reduced spring constants .",
    "this has the effect of lowering the simulated young s modulus at the ends of the ellipsoid by a factor of 10 .",
    "we did not vary the density as the difference in density between ice and rock is much lower than their difference in elastic modulus .",
    "the spring damping parameter @xmath6 does not vary , so @xmath52 , the viscoelastic relaxation time - scale , and tidal frequency , @xmath54 , are the same in both regions .",
    "the measurements of semi - major axis for this simulation and for the homogeneous one with the same axis ratios are shown in figure [ fig : icy ] along with linear fits that measure the secular drift rate .",
    "we measured the drift rate in semi - major axis in this simulation , finding that it is about 5.2 times faster than the homogeneous ellipsoid with the same axis ratios and 10 times faster than the equivalent homogeneous sphere .",
    "even a small fraction of softer material can significantly affect the simulated drift rates .",
    "perhaps this should have been expected based on the strong sensitivity to elastic anisotropy that we inferred from the cubic lattice model simulations .    the classical tidal formula for the tidal drift rate in semi - major axis @xmath80 ( e.g. , @xcite ) for perturbing object @xmath12 ( here hiiaka ) due to tidal dissipation in the spinning body @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the love number and dissipation factor for haumea .",
    "we can describe corrections to the tidal drift rate by multiplying the right hand side by a parameter @xmath84 .",
    "the above equation implies that @xmath85 ( taking into account dependence on @xmath86 ) . we integrate the above equation for haumea to estimate the time it takes hiiaka to tidally drift outwards to its current semi - major axis .",
    "putting unknowns on the left hand side @xmath87 with mass axis ratio @xmath88 and where we have used values from table [ tab : haumea ] and an age @xmath89 gyr for the timescale over which tidal migration is taking place . here",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 are the mean motion and orbital semi - major axis of hiiaka at its current location .",
    "if @xmath92 for haumea is as large as 0.01 ( at the border of what would be consistent with rigidity for rocky material ) and we use corrections for shape and composition increasing the drift rate by @xmath93 then we have equality only if the dissipation parameter is large ; @xmath94 .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that hiiaka alone tidally drifted to its current location even if the tidal drift rate is larger by a factor of 10 than estimated using the equivalent volume rocky sphere .",
    "one explanation for the origin of haumea s satellites and compositional family is a collisional disruption of a past large moon of haumea @xcite .",
    "the ` ur - satellite ' would have formed closer to haumea and because of its large mass , could have migrated more quickly than hiiaka outward during the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "the failure of our enhanced tidal drift rate estimate to account for hiiaka s current position would suport the ` ur - satellite ' proposal ( also see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the discovery of spinning elongated bodies such as haumea , we have carried out a series of mass - spring model simulations to measure the tidally induced drift rate ( in orbital semi - major axis ) of homogeneous spinning viscoelastic triaxial ellipsoids in a circular orbit about a point mass .",
    "we have restricted this initial study to bodies spinning about the shortest principal body axis aligned with the orbital axis and with tidal frequency times the viscoelastic timescale @xmath95 , sufficiently small to ensure that the torque is linear in @xmath54 .",
    "our simulations and order of magnitude estimates show that the tidal torque or associated orbital semi - major axis drift rates , when normalized by that of a spherical body of equivalent volume , are described by @xmath96 with @xmath3 consistent with our random lattice simulations but @xmath4 predicted via order of magnitude estimates .",
    "this function is a good match to the prolate simulations using either value of @xmath97 but better matches the oblate and all the triaxial ones with @xmath3 .    for a homogeneous body with axis ratios equal to those of haumea ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 )",
    "we estimate that the drift rate in orbital semi - major axis is about twice as fast as that estimated for a spherical body with the same mass and volume .",
    "motivated by the proposal that ice could have accumulated at haumea s ends @xcite we also ran a simulation of a non - homogeneous body with 20% of the springs ( those at the ends of the body ) set at 1/10th the strength of those in the core , approximating a body comprised of two materials , ice and rock .",
    "this simulation has a drift rate 10 times higher than the equivalent homogeneous sphere . reexamining the tidal evolution of hiiaka",
    ", we find that even this increase by 10 is insufficient to have allowed hiiaka to have drifted tidally to its current location via tidal interaction with haumea alone . we have only considered the behavior of a solid body with fixed axis ratios and a static viscoelastic rheology and we have neglected the role of namaka .",
    "more complex models , perhaps taking into account how material properties and their distribution are affected by the tidally induced heat , could reexamine this conclusion .",
    "we experimented with using a cubic lattice distribution for simulated mass nodes , but suspect that the random spring model is more accurate because it is elastically isotropic , even though the cubic lattice is more homogeneous and can be set up with shorter springs at the same number of mass nodes .",
    "the random spring model is hampered by a soft and weak surface region with depth set by the maximum length of the springs .",
    "until we speed up the gravity computation ( perhaps using a multipole method ) we can not on a single processor increase the number of particles past a few thousand so as to reduce the effect of the soft surface layer .",
    "spin orbit resonances and vibrational modes have been neglected from this study and the order of magnitude scaling estimates rely on crude approximation for the stresses associated with tidal acceleration .",
    "the mass spring model approximates a kelvin - voigt viscoelastic rheology with poisson ratio of 1/4 rather than an incompressible maxwell or andrade rheology .",
    "recently developed methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) might be modified or extended to improve upon the scaling arguments presented here .",
    "future work , both analytical and numerical , will be required to improve upon the accuracy of tidal computations for bodies with extreme axis ratios .",
