    "recent studies@xcite-@xcite reveal an unexpected connection between a certain category of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) and integrable models ( i m ) with quantum group symmetry .",
    "we call this ode / im correspondence .",
    "the success inherits the fruitful results from the exact wkb analysis@xcite-@xcite and progress in the study of integrable structure @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present talk is two - fold , the survey on the 2nd order ode case , and the brief preview on the generalization to higher order cases .",
    "firstly , we will review the results on the 2nd order differential equations , the schrdinger equation with a polynomial potential , @xmath1 we will mainly follow the argument in @xcite but employ some simplifications and add some materials . motivated by the success of the exact wkb method",
    ", we regard the coordinate @xmath2 as a complex variable .",
    "the complex @xmath2 plane is conveniently divided into sectors .",
    "see section [ defstokes ] .",
    "each sector possesses two (= the order of the equation ) linear independent solutions .",
    "we call them a fundamental set of solutions ( fss ) .",
    "the relations among fss of different sectors are of our interest . to be precise",
    ", we would like to evaluate the stokes multiplier which characterizes the connection rule .",
    "in this view point , it is natural to regard that the problem consists of two coupled equations , the original differential equation and the difference equation for the stokes multiplier .",
    "it will be then shown that fundamental objects in the study of the solvable models , e.g. , baxter s @xmath0 operator , fusion hierarchy of transfer matrices based on @xmath3 and their functional relations naturally come into play in the analyses on ode .",
    "especially , ( unfused ) transfer matrix is identified with the stokes multiplier . reflecting the ode / im correspondence",
    ", the stokes multiplier has two representations , the wronskian representation , which arises from ode , and the dvf representation , originated from i m .",
    "they both play a role in generalizing the results in the second part of the talk .    physically , the stokes multiplier may be less interesting . rather , the quantity of importance is the spectral determinant , @xmath4 or eigenvalues themselves .",
    "remarkably , @xmath5 also belongs to the fusion hierarchy .",
    "thus the result provides a unified view of stokes multipliers and spectral determinant .    in the second part",
    ", a generalization to higher order ode will be addressed ,    @xmath6    in @xcite , functional relations were derived among stokes multipliers and their generalizations .",
    "these are identical to functional relations among transfer matrices of solvable models with @xmath7 symmetry , which generalizes the observation for @xmath8 .",
    "the relations were evolved by use of the machinery in the solvable models , a quantum analogue of the jacobi - trudi formula . here",
    "we will give an alternative , much simpler derivation , resulting from the wronskian representation of the stokes multipliers .",
    "we also note that the possible connection of the relations to discrete soliton equations ( the hirota - miwa equation)@xcite .",
    "the parallelism to i m will be further exploited .",
    "the eigenvalues of transfer matrices possess a universal structure called the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) .",
    "the universality has a deep origin in analyticity of their expressions under bethe ansatz equations and the yang - baxter integrability .",
    "we will show that stokes multipliers also assume the same dvf .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the asymptotic form for @xmath9th ode",
    "will be discussed in section [ defstokes ] .",
    "several notations and symbols , such as sectors , stokes matrices , are introduced for @xmath10 general . in the next three sections ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath8 case .",
    "the recursion relations and functional relations for the stokes multiplier and its generalizations are derived in section [ frsl2 ] . under certain assumptions ,",
    "one transforms the algebraic relations to a set of integral equations modulo one unknown parameter . remarkably , the integral equations take identical forms to thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations",
    ". we shall discuss the dvf representation for the stokes multiplier in section [ dvf ] .",
    "the spectral problem is addressed in section [ spectral ] . utilizing the previous results ,",
    "spectral determinants are identified and the one missing parameter in section [ frsl2 ] will be determined . the extension to arbitrary @xmath10 is the topics of sections [ frsln ] and [ dvfsln ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief summary and discussion in section [ sumdis ] .    while preparing the manuscript , i find the preprint @xcite appearing on e - print .",
    "the content of the paper largely overlaps with the second part of the present manuscript .",
    "they actually treated a more general set of ode but without the argument of the functional relations .",
    "the details of the present section can be found in @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the asymptotic behavior of a slightly generalized differential equation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are complex numbers and @xmath13 .",
    "note that the factor @xmath14 is not essential .",
    "it can be adsorbed into re - definition of the angle of @xmath2 . for later convenience",
    ", we will include this factor throughout out this report .    now that @xmath15 is an irregular singular point of the equation , analytic properties of the solutions are different for different angle regions in complex @xmath2 plane .",
    "let @xmath16 be a region in the plane satisfying @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "we first analyze the asymptotic behavior of a subdominant solution in @xmath20 .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath21 by the relation , @xmath22 a key function @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 stands for @xmath29    in addition , we introduce an exponent @xmath30 by @xmath31    in @xmath20 , there exists a subdominant solution to ( [ difp ] ) @xmath32 which has the asymptotic behavior ,    @xmath33    a normalization factor @xmath34 is introduced for convenience in the later discussion , @xmath35 as argued in @xcite , the range of the validity of the asymptotic form is wider if one forgets the subdominance .",
    "explicitly , it is valid for @xmath36 .",
    "the intriguing feature in the differential equation ( [ difp ] ) is a certain symmetry in rotating @xmath2 plane .    if @xmath32 is the prescribed solution , then @xmath37 is also a solution to ( [ difp ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 signifies @xmath39 .",
    "the operation @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    from now on ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to a single potential term case , @xmath43 one immediately verifies that @xmath44 and thus @xmath45 for @xmath46 . under the operation of @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in term of @xmath49 ,",
    "the action of @xmath47 is simply given by @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , @xmath51 .    a set of fundamental solutions ( fss ) in @xmath16 is formed by by @xmath52 .",
    "we introduce a @xmath53 matrix @xmath54 @xmath55 we denote the wronskian , the determinant of @xmath54 , by @xmath56 .",
    "note that the above asymptotic expansion is valid for @xmath57 in the common sector @xmath58 . as @xmath56 is constant in @xmath2 ,",
    "one easily checks the linear independence of these solutions by using the asymptotic expansion ( [ asy ] ) at the sector .",
    "due to the present normalization of @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 .    a stokes matrix @xmath61 connects ffs of @xmath62 and @xmath63    @xmath64    the linear independence of solutions demands @xmath61 in the following form ,    @xmath65    we call elements @xmath66 stokes multipliers .    by the cramer s formula ,",
    "one represents @xmath67 as    @xmath68    that is , @xmath69 is inserted in the @xmath70th column in the denominator .",
    "evidently @xmath71 .    the above representation ( [ wrep ] ) of stokes multipliers",
    "will be referred to as the wronskian representation .",
    "determinants of such structure will be hereafter abbreviated to , by specifying only the first row , @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "generally , @xmath73:= \\begin{pmatrix } y_{i_1 } , & y_{i_2 } , &   \\cdots , & y_{i_n}\\\\ \\vdots   &           &           &   \\vdots \\\\ \\partial^{n-1 } y_{i_1},&\\partial^{n-1 } y_{i_2 } , & \\cdots , &    \\partial^{n-1}y_{i_n } \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ]    we have prepared materials needed for study on general @xmath10 . in the next few sections , however , we confine ourselves to the @xmath8 case .",
    "there are two reasons for the separated argument .",
    "first , only for @xmath8 case , we have a clear bridge between the connection problem and the spectral problem .",
    "second , the second order ode may be the most relevant to physics .",
    "the ingenious idea in @xcite lies in the introduction of the generalized ( or fusion ) stokes matrices connecting the second neighboring sectors , the third neighboring sectors , and so on .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the fusion stokes matrices connecting two fss , @xmath75 and @xmath76    @xmath77    obviously , the recursion relation holds , @xmath78    @xmath79 has an expression @xmath80 where we adopt @xmath81 .",
    "thanks to the condition @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . naturally ,",
    "@xmath85 are referred to as the generalized stokes multipliers .",
    "due to ( [ recur ] ) they satisfy relations , @xmath86    0.9 cm * example *    for @xmath87 , @xmath88 it is well known that the eigenfunction is given by airy function @xmath89 .",
    "the above connection rule then fixes the stokes multiplier for airy function @xmath90 .",
    "0.9 cm    let @xmath91 .",
    "one can then prove @xmath92 using ( [ recursiontau ] ) and the mathematical induction .",
    "_ these functional relations exactly coincide with those among fusion transfer matrices of _ @xmath3 . in the latter context ,",
    "the suffix @xmath93 specifies the spin @xmath94 assigned to the auxiliary space .",
    "they are the closed set of equations among finitely many unknown functions @xmath95 .",
    "thus they may be of significance in the estimation of the quantity of our original interest , @xmath96 . actually , with additional assumptions on the analyticity and asymptotic behavior of @xmath97",
    ", one can fix @xmath96 via coupled nonlinear integral equations resulting from ( [ tsyssl2 ] ) . to see this",
    ", we conveniently put @xmath98 and @xmath99 . now",
    "the functional relations read @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath102 .",
    "* assumption * [ assumeanzc]@xmath103 @xmath104 are analytic , nonzero and have constant asymptotic behavior ( anzc ) in the strips @xmath105 $ ] , @xmath106 $ ] respectively.the validity of this assumption will be discussed in section [ spectral ] .",
    "once this is granted , one immediately derives from ( [ ysys ] ) @xcite ,    @xmath107    where @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the asterisk denotes the convolution , @xmath111 .",
    "this type of coupled integral equations is known as thermodynamic bethe ansatz equation(tba ) .",
    "one finds them in various branches of i m , e.g. , the thermodynamics of 1d spin chains or the perturbation theory of cft .",
    "the kernel , @xmath112 , is related to the two particle s - matrix @xmath113 of quantum field theory based on @xmath114 by @xmath115 and @xmath116    the set of equations ( [ sl2tba ] ) fixes @xmath117 for a given @xmath118 .    to determine the factor @xmath119 , it needs an independent ingredient from the spectral theory .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ spectral ] .",
    "we have a remark . for the later use in the spectral problem",
    ", we have introduced generalized stokes matrices and derived functional relations ( [ tsyssl2 ] ) from the obvious recursion relation ( [ recur ] ) .",
    "they can be also easily extracted from the following wronskian representation of @xmath120 ,    @xmath121    for @xmath122 , the situation is different .",
    "the generalized stokes matrices can be defined similarly .",
    "their elements , however , do not contain nice generalization of @xmath123 s . the formal definition of the wronskian type like ( [ wronsk ] ) still works efficiently .",
    "see the discussion in section [ frsln ] .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the stokes multipliers share same functional relations with the transfer matrices of i m . below",
    "we will discuss if this correspondence carries forward .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices in solvable models exhibit a universal structure often referred to as the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) .",
    "we shall explain dvf for the simplest the @xmath124 case with the dimension of the auxiliary space being 2 .    obviously , the highest weight state (= vacuum ) is the trivial eigenstate of the transfer matrix .",
    "its eigenvalue consists of two terms , reflecting the dimensionality of the auxiliary space .",
    "each of them is given by the simple product of the local weights which is termed as the vacuum expectation value , @xmath125 this expression must be modified for general eigenvalues .",
    "the quantum inverse scattering method yields the exact expression .",
    "the result tells that @xmath126 must be modified by `` dressing '' the vacuum expectation values with ratios of baxter s @xmath127 operator ( or its eigenvalue ) which commutes with @xmath128 , @xmath129=0 $ ] , @xmath130    the fact that the eigenvalue must be pole free results the famous bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) , @xmath131 where @xmath132 .",
    "this kind of representation is called dvf .    clearly , eq ( [ dvf6v ] ) has an interpretation as the second order difference equation ( baxter s t - q relation ) , @xmath133 thus two independent solutions exist which we call @xmath134 .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that dvf is universal for models based on general @xmath135 under certain assumptions .",
    "the key ingredient in the argument is the analyticity under bae .",
    "thus we may conclude that dvf embodies the bae or yang - baxter integrable structure .",
    "now we turn to the @xmath136 of ( [ stokes0 ] ) .",
    "the stokes multiplier @xmath96 is given by @xmath137 in two manners ,    @xmath138    originally , the rhs can be evaluated at any @xmath2 yielding the same @xmath96 .",
    "we adopt a convention to enumerate them at the origin for the later convenience .",
    "see section [ spectral ] .    by comparison of ( [ dvf6v ] ) and ( [ taudvf ] ) and the identification , @xmath139 , made after ( [ recursiontau ] ) , we deduce @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "precisely , the argument in the next section concludes @xmath142 and @xmath143    the linear independence of fss implies that @xmath96 is pole - free . on the other hand , @xmath144 can generally be zero for some @xmath145 .",
    "thus we have bae for stokes multipliers .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath146 , which is by no means a solution to the original ode , now appears as the second `` solution '' to the difference equation .",
    "this issue will be further pursued in a later section .",
    "the coincidence is not only for the spin 1/2 case , but also for cases of arbitrary spins .",
    "this can be easily seen as they share the same initial condition and the functional relations .",
    "one can also verify this directly using the wronskian representation .",
    "for this we rewrite the condition @xmath60 in the form ,    @xmath147    with use of this , one obtains    @xmath148    which coincides with the known expression for the transfer matrix . actually the discussion like above has been firstly found as the operator identity under the name of the quantum wronskian form .",
    "we follow the discussion in @xcite for reproducing the dvf for the spin @xmath94 case .    before closing the section , we present simplest examples ( @xmath149 ) where explicit solutions are available by elementary functions @xcite .",
    "we shall use @xmath150 instead of @xmath49 ( @xmath151 ) and adopt same symbols , y , @xmath66 etc as the function of @xmath150 .",
    "0.9 cm this is a well known example in quantum mechanics .",
    "the wave function @xmath152 is given by the airy function .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath87 , we have @xmath153 ( theorem 3 ) .",
    "thus @xmath154 relation simplifies ,    @xmath155    these relations coincide with the 3-solution dependence relation for the airy function@xcite ,    @xmath156    where @xmath157 .",
    "to check this , we use @xmath158 in the arguments in the first of ( [ simpletq ] ) , @xmath159 and substitute @xmath160 in the coefficients of the first relation in ( [ airyrel ] ) , @xmath161 the second relations can be checked similarly .",
    "0.9 cm the case with the harmonic oscillator is slightly complicated as the asymptotic formula must be modified .",
    "we utilize known facts on the weber s function @xmath162 , @xmath163 which has an asymptotic behavior for @xmath164 , @xmath165 it has the 2nd order irregular singularity at @xmath166 and regular elsewhere .",
    "the fss consists of @xmath167 or @xmath168 .",
    "the connection rule reads ,    @xmath169    there exist recurrence relations , @xmath170    obviously , @xmath171 is given in terms of @xmath162 . in order to cancel the phase factor arising from the asymptotic behavior ,",
    "we define precisely @xmath172 where @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 . they constitute our fss .    by definition , @xmath176 . remembering @xmath177 so that @xmath178 , we rewrite this into the form , @xmath179 with @xmath180 . by comparing this with ( [ weberconn ] )",
    "we conclude @xmath181 which coincides with the result from cft@xcite .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath182 are proportional to weber s function and its derivative at the origin .",
    "thanks to the recursion relations ( [ recurd ] ) , we can replace the latter by again weber s function with the unit shift in @xmath183 ,    @xmath184    we shall utilize the following integral representation for @xmath162 , @xmath185 where @xmath186 surrounds the positive real axis counterclockwise .",
    "the evaluation at @xmath187 is then straightforward , @xmath188 hence ,    @xmath189    for general values of @xmath190 , the representations of @xmath191 or @xmath134 by elementary functions are not known .",
    "still , we can evaluate them , e.g. , from solutions to tba ( [ sl2tba ] ) . to fix one missing parameter @xmath119 there , we next consider the spectral problem .",
    "the final section for the @xmath8 case is devoted to the spectral problem for @xmath192 and @xmath193 being an integer .",
    "we will still use @xmath150 instead of @xmath49 .",
    "we first put some remarks on elementary facts .",
    "let @xmath194 be a our hamiltonian operator , @xmath195 .",
    "we call @xmath196 the eigen - function and @xmath150 , the eigenvalue of @xmath194 if @xmath197 and @xmath198 is a vector in the hilbert space satisfying , e.g. , @xmath199 .",
    "let @xmath200 be a spatial inversion operator such that @xmath201 for any operators or vectors .",
    "obviously , @xmath202=0 $ ] .",
    "thus if @xmath197 then @xmath203 . since @xmath204 is an identity operator , @xmath205 .",
    "consequentially , we have    if @xmath197 then",
    "@xmath206 or @xmath207 .    the above lemma does not require the boundary condition @xmath208 imposed by our potential .",
    "two conditions can not be satisfied simultaneously . or otherwise , @xmath209 for arbitrary @xmath10 , resulting a trivial @xmath210 .",
    "thus a lemma follows .",
    "eigenvalues are classified by the parities of the associated eigenfunctions .",
    "we denote @xmath211 if @xmath212 and @xmath213 if @xmath214    on the positive real axis , @xmath215 up to normalizations .",
    "we have @xmath216=a(e)$ ] from the obvious asymptotic behavior , @xmath217 .",
    "as the eigenfunction must be bounded , @xmath218 if @xmath219 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath220 for some @xmath221 then @xmath222 is proportional to @xmath223 . thus @xmath222 is bounded as @xmath224 _ and _ it is recessive as @xmath225 due to the parity argument .",
    "in addition , it is a solution to the eigenvalue equation",
    ". then , by definition , @xmath221 belongs to the set of eigenvalues .",
    "we conclude ,    [ de ] if @xmath215 on the positive real axis , then @xmath226 where @xmath227 .",
    "finally we quote results from the wkb analysis ,    for the potential @xmath228 , the energy levels @xmath229 and the spectral determinant @xmath5 behave asymptotically as @xmath230    we shall apply the above general observation to results obtained in the preceding sections .",
    "the connection rule enables a representation of @xmath5 in terms of @xmath223 . to check this",
    ", we consider the stokes matrix @xmath231 .",
    "it connects fss on the positive and the negative real axes .",
    "we start from the negative real axis .",
    "if @xmath150 takes an eigenvalue , then @xmath232 apart from a normalization .",
    "the connection rule demands it behave on the positive axis , @xmath233 lemma [ de ] tells @xmath234 .    on the other hand , we consider the @xmath235 case of ( [ wronsk ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath236 , and @xmath237 . then @xmath238 . since the lhs is independent of @xmath2 and",
    "the rhs is not singular at @xmath239 , we conveniently put @xmath239 in the rhs and find @xmath240 .",
    "thus , as a function of @xmath150 , @xmath241 has only zeros at eigenvalues .",
    "then the above lemma leads to their identification with @xmath242 .",
    "the choice of the evaluation at @xmath239 here and in the previous section is now clear .",
    "summarizing , we have a theorem .",
    "[ thde ] the fusion hierarchy contains @xmath5 as its @xmath243 th member , @xmath244 a base of fss and its derivative at the origin are proportional to spectral determinants depending on parities , @xmath245    the previous explicit result ( [ qforl2 ] ) for @xmath246 is quite consistent with this .",
    "@xmath182 s are nothing but @xmath247 here .",
    "they are vanishing at known spectra of the harmonic oscillator , @xmath248 , where @xmath249(even / odd ) corresponds to the parity @xmath250 ( even / odd ) .",
    "these identifications lead to the expression for @xmath191 via spectral determinants , @xmath251 more significantly , we have baes , @xmath252 these equations , combined with the wkb result , are efficient enough to determine the spectral determinants , being transformed into coupled nonlinear integral equations .",
    "we , however , take a different route here and utilize them as a tool to investigate tba ( [ sl2tba ] ) .",
    "let us revisit to the assumption [ assumeanzc ] raised in section [ frsl2 ] .",
    "suppose all energy levels are enumerated exactly so that @xmath247 are constructed",
    ". then @xmath253 is estimated . by the use of the analogue of the relation([recursiontau ] ) , we can successively generate @xmath254 and check the validity of the assumption . strictly speaking , as we have infinitely many levels , this procedure can not be accomplished .",
    "one however knows that the wkb approximation is fairy accurate for higher energy levels .",
    "thus we input first 100 exact energy levels and approximate rests by the wkb results , to evaluate @xmath247 .",
    "our numerical results indicate the remarkable patterns ,    zeros of @xmath254 are of the first order and always distribute on the negative real @xmath150 axis .",
    "this supports the assumption , although by no means a proof . as an example , the contourplot for @xmath255 , @xmath256 is depicted in fig.[figzeros ] .    ,",
    "@xmath256,width=226 ]    these patterns imply that the state corresponds to `` the vacuum '' ( the ground state ) in i m @xcite .",
    "there is also an independent support to this conjecture @xcite .",

    "the numerical and analytical studies on the @xmath257-symmetric hamiltonian in @xcite conclude positive and real eigenvalues for @xmath260 , which is consistent with the conjecture .",

    "in the present report , we discuss a curious connection between @xmath327 the order ode and integrable models . when @xmath8 , the connection is efficient enough to derive analytic equations which yields estimations of eigenvalues and stokes multipliers .    for higher @xmath10 ,",

    "unfortunately , the definition of the eigenvalue problem is not necessary clear for higher order differential equations .",

    "the lack of the connection prevents us from writing down the integral equations and evaluating parameters like `` @xmath119 '' for @xmath8 .",

    "on the other hand , construction of @xmath127 functions via the standard `` pair - propagation '' argument @xcite seems to be far more complicated for @xmath122 . to the authors knowledge",

    "the systematic construction found in ode is not obvious in i m .",
    "the present results for ode may be a clear guide for analyses in the analogous issue in i m , but it needs further research .    finally , we comment that the ode / im correspondence is still at the `` phenomenological '' stage",
    ". the fundamental question as to the origin of the correspondence is still open .",
