    "in the renormalization of quantum field theories , to extract finite physical results from higher order perturbative calculations , a certain subtraction scheme is necessary to be used so as to remove the divergences occurring in the calculations .",
    "there are various subtraction schemes in the literature , such as the minimal subtraction ( ms)@xmath0 , the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 , the momentum space subtraction ( mom)@xmath3 , the on - mass - shell subtraction ( os ) @xmath4 , the off - mass shell subtraction ( oms)@xmath5 and etc .. however , there exists a serious ambiguity problem@xmath6 that different subtraction schemes in general give different physical predictions , conflicting the fact that the physical observables are independent of the subtraction schemes .",
    "ordinarily , it is argued that the ambiguity appears only in finite order perturbative calculations , while the exact result given by the whole perturbation series is scheme- independent .",
    "though only a finite order perturbative calculation is able to be done in practice , one still expects to get unambiguous results from such a calculation . to solve the ambiguity problem ,",
    "several prescriptions , such as the minimal sensitivity principle@xmath7 , the effective charge method@xmath8 and some others@xmath9 , were proposed in the past . by the principle of minimal sensitivity",
    ", an additional condition has to be introduced and imposed on the result calculated in a finite order perturbative approximation so as to obtain an optimum approximant which is least sensitive to variations in the unphysical parameters . in the effective charge method ,",
    "the use of a coupling constant is abandoned . instead",
    ", an effective charge is associated with each physical quantity and used to determine the gell - mann - low function in the renormalization group equation ( rge ) . in this way , a renormalization - scheme - invariant result can be found from the rge . in ref.(9 ) , the authors developed a new perturbation approach to renormalizable field theories .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that if the perturbation series of a quantity r is not directly computable due to that the expansion coefficients are infinite , the unambiguous result of the quantity can be found by solving the differential equation @xmath10 where f(r ) is well - defined and can be expanded as a series of r. particularly , the finite coefficients of the expansion of f(r ) are renormalization - scheme - independent and in one - to - one correspondence with the ones in the ordinary perturbation series of the r. the prescriptions mentioned above are somehow different from the conventional perturbation theory in which the coupling constant is commonly chosen to be the expansion parameter for a perturbation series .    in this paper , we wish to deal with the ambiguity problem from a different angle .",
    "it will be shown that the ambiguity problem can be directly tackled in the conventional perturbation theory by the renormalization group method@xmath11 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the anomalous dimension in a rge is well - defined although it is computed from the renormalization constant which is divergent in its original definition . in comparison of the renormalization group method with the aforementioned approach proposed in ref.(9 ) , we see , both of them are much similar to one another in methodology .",
    "this suggests that the renormalization group method is also possible to yield the theoretical results which are free from the ambiguity .",
    "the possibility relies on how to choose a good subtraction scheme which gives rise to such renormalization constants that they lead to unique anomalous dimensions .",
    "the so - called good subtraction scheme means that it must respect necessary physical and mathematical requirements such as the gauge symmetry , the lorentz invariance and the mathematical convergence principle .",
    "the necessity of these requirements is clear .",
    "particularly , in the renormalization group approach to the renormalization problem , the renormalization constants obtained from a subtraction scheme not only serve to subtract the divergences , but also are directly used to derive physical results .",
    "apparently , to guarantee the calculated results to be able to give faithful theoretical predictions , the subtraction procedure necessarily complies with the basic principles established well in physics and mathematics . otherwise , the subtraction scheme should be discarded and thus the scheme - ambiguity will be reduced .",
    "let us explain this viewpoint in some detail from the following aspects : ( 1 ) for a gauge field theory , as one knows , the gauge - invariance is embodied in the ward identity .",
    "this identity is a fundamental constraint for the theory .",
    "therefore , a subtraction scheme , if it is applicable , could not defy this identity . as will be demonstrated in latter sections , the ward identity not only establishes exact relations between renormalization constants , but also determines the functional structure of renormalization constants ; ( 2 ) the lorentz - invariance is partly reflected in the energy - momentum conservation which holds at every vertex . since the renormalization point in the renormalization constants will be eventually transformed to the momentum in the solutions of rges , obviously , in order to get correct functional relations of the solutions with the momentum , the energy - momentum conservation could not be violated by the subtraction of vertices ; ( 3 ) why the convergence principle is required in the renormalization calculation ? as we know , the renormalization constants are divergent in their original appearance .",
    "such divergent quantities are not well - defined mathematically and hence are not directly calculable@xmath9because we are not allowed to apply any computational rule to do a meaningful or unambiguous calculation for this kind of quantities .",
    "the meaningful calculation can only be done for the regularized form of renormalization constants which are derived from corresponding regularized feynman integrals in a subtraction scheme .",
    "the necessity of introducing the regularization procedure in the quantum field theory may clearly be seen from the mathematical viewpoint as illustrated in appendix a. therefore , in renormalization group calculations , the correct procedure of computing anomalous dimensions is starting from the regularized form of renormalization constants .",
    "the limit operation taken for the regularization parameter should be performed after completing the differentiation with respect to the renormalization point .",
    "since the anomalous dimensions are convergent , the limit is meaningful and would give definite results .",
    "obviously , the above procedure of computing the anomalous dimensions agrees with the convergence principle ; ( 4 ) in comparison with the other subtraction schemes , the mom scheme appears to be more suitable for renormalization group calculations .",
    "this is because this scheme naturally provides not only a renormalization point which is needed for the renormalization group calculation , but also a renormalization boundary condition for a renormalized quantity ( a wave function , a vertex or a propagator ) , which will be used to fix the solution of the rge for the renormalized quantify .",
    "based on the essential points of view stated above , it may be found that a renormalized quantity can be unambiguously determined by its rge and thus a renormalized s - matrix element can be given in an unique form without any ambiguity . to illustrate this point , we limit ourselves in this paper to take the qed renormalization as an example to show how the ambiguity can be eliminated .",
    "as one knows , the qed renormalization has been extensively investigated by employing the os , @xmath1 and mom schemes in the previous works@xmath12 .",
    "but , most of these studies are concentrated on the large momentum ( short distance ) behaviors of some quantities for the sake of simplicity of the calculation . in this paper , we restudy the qed renormalization with the following features : ( 1 ) the renormalization is performed in a mass - dependent scheme other than in the mass - independent scheme which was adopted in many previous works@xmath13 .",
    "the mass - dependent scheme obviously is more suitable for the case that the mass of a charged fermion can not be set to be zero ; ( 2 ) the subtraction is carried out in such a mom scheme that the renormalization point is mainly taken to be an arbitrary time - like momentum other than a space - like momentum as chosen in the conventional mom scheme .",
    "the time - like mom scheme actually is a generalized mass - shell scheme ( gms ) .",
    "the prominent advantage of the gms scheme is that in this scheme the scale of renormalization point can naturally be connected with the scale of momenta and the results obtained can directly be converted to the corresponding ones given in the os - scheme ; ( 3 ) the subtraction is implemented by fully respecting the necessary physical and mathematical principles mentioned before .",
    "therefore , the results obtained are faithful and free of ambiguity ; ( 4 ) the effective coupling constant and the effective fermion mass obtained in the one - loop approximation are given exact and explicit expressions which were never found in the literature .",
    "these expressions exhibit physically reasonable infrared and ultraviolet behaviors .",
    "we will pay main attention to the infrared ( large distance ) behavior because this behavior is more sensitive to identify whether a subtraction is suitable or not for the qed renormalization .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we sketch the rge and its solution and show how a s - matrix element can be free of ambiguity . in sect.3 , we briefly discuss the ward identity and give a derivation of the subtraction version of the fermion self - energy in the gms scheme . in sect.4",
    ", we derive an exact expression of the one - loop effective coupling constant and discuss its asymptotic property . in sect.5 , the same thing will be done for the effective fermion mass .",
    "the last section serves to make some comments and discussions . in appendix",
    "a , we show a couple of mathematical examples to help understanding the regularization procedure used in the renormalization group calculations .",
    "among different formulations of the rge ( see the review given in ref.(14))@xmath11 , we like to employ the approach presented in ref.(15 ) .",
    "but , we work in a mass - dependent renormalization scheme , therefore , the anomalous dimension in the rge depends not only on the coupling constant , but also on the fermion mass .",
    "suppose @xmath14 is a renormalized quantity .",
    "in the multiplicative renormalization , it is related to the unrenormalized one @xmath15 in such a way @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the renormalization constant of @xmath15 . in gms scheme ,",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath14 are all functions of the renormalization point @xmath18 .",
    "differentiating eq.(2.1 ) with respect to the @xmath19 and noticing that the @xmath15 is independent of @xmath19 , we immediately obtain a rge satisfied by the function @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the anomalous dimension defined by @xmath23 we first note here that the anomalous dimension can only depends on the ratio @xmath24 , @xmath25 because the renormalization constant is dimensionless .",
    "next , we note , eq.(2.2 ) is suitable for a physical parameter ( mass or coupling constant ) , a propagator , a vertex , a wave function or some other green function .",
    "if the function @xmath26 stands for a renormalized green function , vertex or wave function , in general , it not only depends explicitly on the scale @xmath19 , but also on the renormalized coupling constant @xmath27 , mass @xmath28 and gauge parameter @xmath29 which are all functions of @xmath19 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 symbolizes all the momenta .",
    "considering that the function @xmath26 is homogeneous in the momentum and mass , it may be written , under the scaling transformation of momentum @xmath32 , as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the canonical dimension of @xmath15 . since the renormalization point is a momentum taken to subtract the divergence , we may set @xmath35 where @xmath36 which is taken to be the same as in @xmath37 . noticing the above transformation , the solution of the rge in eq.(2.2 ) can be expressed as@xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the running coupling constant , the running mass and the running gauge parameter , respectively .",
    "the solution written above shows the behavior of the function @xmath14 under the scaling of momenta .    how to determine the function @xmath42 on the rhs of eq.(2.5 ) when the @xmath43 stands for a wave function , a propagator or a vertex ?",
    "this question can be unambiguously answered in mom scheme , but was not answered clearly in the literature @xmath44 .",
    "noticing that the momentum @xmath45 and the renormalization point @xmath46 are fixed , but may be chosen arbitrarily , we may , certainly , set @xmath47 . with this choice , by making use of the following boundary condition satisfied by a propagator , a vertex or a wave function @xmath48 where the function @xmath49 is of the form of free propagator , bare vertex or free wave function and independent of the renormalization point ( see the examples given in the next section ) and considering the homogeneity of the function @xmath14 as mentioned in eq.(2.4 ) , we may write @xmath50 where the renormalized coupling constant , mass and vertex in the function @xmath51 become the running ones . with the expression given in eq.(2.7 ) ,",
    "eq.(2.5 ) will finally be written in the form @xmath52 for a gauge field theory , it is easy to check that the anomalous dimension in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) will be cancelled out in s - matrix elements . to show this point",
    "more specifically , let us take the two - electron scattering taking place in t - channel as an example .",
    "considering that a s - matrix element expressed in terms of unrenormalized quantities is equal to that represented by the corresponding renormalized quantities , the scattering amplitude may be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 ; @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 represent the fermion wave function , the proper vertex and the photon propagator respectively which are all renormalized .",
    "the renormalization constants of the wave function , the propagator and the vertex will be designated by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the constant @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 because the vertex in eq.(2.9 ) contains a coupling constant in it .",
    "according to the formula given in eq.(2.8 ) , the renormalized fermion wave function , photon propagator and vertex can be represented in the forms as shown below . for the fermion wave function",
    ", we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the free wave function in which @xmath63 is the running mass and @xmath64 is the anomalous dimension of fermion wave function . for the renormalized photon propagator , we can write @xmath65 where @xmath66_{}\\ ] ] is the free propagator with @xmath67 being the running gauge parameter in it and @xmath68 is the anomalous dimension of the propagator . for the renormalized vertex",
    ", it reads @xmath69 where    @xmath70    is the bare vertex containing the running coupling constant ( the electric charge ) @xmath71 in it and @xmath72 is the anomalous dimension of the vertex here the relation in eq.(2.10 ) has been used . upon substituting eqs.(2.11 ) , ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.17 ) into eq.(2.9 ) and noticing eqs .",
    "( 2.13 ) , ( 2.16 ) and ( 2.19 ) , we find that the anomalous dimensions in the s - matrix element are all cancelled out with each other . as a result , we arrive at @xmath73 this expression clearly shows that the exact s - matrix element of the two - electron scattering can be represented in the form as given in the lowest order ( tree diagram ) approximation except that all the physical parameters in the matrix elements are replaced by their effective ( running ) ones . for other s - matrix elements ,",
    "the conclusion is the same .",
    "this is because any s - matrix element is unexceptionably expressed in terms of a number of wave functions , propagators and proper vertices each of which can be represented in the form as shown in eq.(2.8 ) and the anomalous dimensions in the matrix element , as can be easily proved , are all cancelled out eventually .",
    "this result and the fact that any s - matrix element is independent of the gauge parameter ( this is the so - called gauge - invariance of s - matrix which is implied by the unitarity of s - matrix elements ) indicate that the task of renormalization for a gauge field theory is reduced to find the running coupling constant and the running mass by their rges .",
    "these running quantities completely describe the effect of higher order perturbative corrections .",
    "in qed renormalization , the following ward identity plays crucial role @xmath5@xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the vertex correction which is defined by taking out a coupling constant e and @xmath76 denotes the fermion self - energy .",
    "firstly , we show how the above identity determines the subtraction of the fermion self - energy @xmath77 .",
    "according to the ward identity , the divergence in @xmath75 should be , in the gms scheme , subtracted at a time - like ( minkowski ) renormalization point for the momenta of the external fermion lines , @xmath78 which implies @xmath79 . when @xmath80 ( the fermion mass ) , we will come to the subtraction in the os scheme . in the case of @xmath81 ,",
    "the subtraction is defined on a generalized mass shell . at the renormalization point @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath82 thus , the vertex correction may be represented as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a divergent constant depending on @xmath19 and @xmath85 is the finite correction satisfying the boundary condition @xmath86    on inserting eq.(3.3 ) into eq.(3.1 ) and integrating the both sides of eq.(3.1 ) over the momentum @xmath87 , we get @xmath88 where the momentum @xmath45 is chosen to make @xmath89 . since the last term on the rhs of eq.(3.5 ) vanishes when @xmath90 , we may write @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a convergent function satisfying the following boundary condition @xmath93 which is implied by eq.(3.4 ) . substituting eq.(3.6 ) into eq.(3.5 ) and setting @xmath94 and @xmath95 the self - energy is finally written as @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constants a and b have absorbed all the divergences appearing in the @xmath76 .",
    "the above derivation shows that the subtraction given in eq.(3.10 ) is uniquely correct in the gms scheme as it is compatible with the ward identity .",
    "according to the subtraction in eq.(3.3 ) , the full vertex can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the vertex renormalization constant defined as @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the renormalized vertex represented by @xmath101 which satisfies the boundary condition @xmath102    based on the subtraction given in eq.(3.10 ) , the full fermion propagator may be renormalized in such a way @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the propagator renormalization constant defined by @xmath105 and @xmath106 denotes the renormalized propagator represented as @xmath107 which has a boundary condition as follows @xmath108 in eq.(3.17 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath109 designate the renormalized mass and the finite correction of the self - energy respectively .",

    "in the following we show the result given in the landau gauge which was regarded as the preferred gauge in the literature@xmath199 , @xmath200 in the limit @xmath171 , @xmath201 this clearly indicates that when @xmath151 varies from 1 to zero , the @xmath63 almost keeps unchanged .",
    "this result physically is reasonable .",
    "whereas , in the region of @xmath202 , the @xmath63 decreases with increase of @xmath151 and goes to zero near the critical point @xmath177 .",
    "this behavior suggests that at very high energy , the fermion mass may be ignored in the evaluation of s - matrix elements .",
    "in this paper , the qed renormalization has been restudied in the gms scheme .",
    "the exact and explicit expressions of the one - loop effective coupling constant and fermion mass are obtained in the mass - dependent renormalization scheme and show reasonable asymptotic behaviors . a key point to achieve these results",
    "is that the subtraction is performed in the way of respecting the ward identity , i.e. the gauge symmetry . for comparison",
    ", it is mentioned that in some previous literature@xmath203 , the fermion self - energy is represented in such a form @xmath204 if we subtract the divergence in the @xmath76 at the renormalization point @xmath205 , the fermion propagator is still expressed in the form as written in eqs.(3.15 ) and ( 3.17 ) ; but , the renormalization constants @xmath104 and @xmath111 are now defined by @xmath206\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the one - loop expressions of the @xmath207 and @xmath208 can directly be read from eq.(3.22 ) . here",
    ", we show the one - loop anomalous dimension of fermion propagator which is given by the above subtraction @xmath209\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in comparison of the above @xmath210 with the @xmath211 shown in eq.(3.30 ) , we see , the ward identity in eq.(3.29 ) can not be fulfilled unless in the zero - mass limit @xmath212 .",
    "since the ward identity is an essential criterion to identify whether a subtraction is correct or not , the subtraction stated above should be excluded from the mass - dependent renormalization .",
    "another point we would like to address is that in the ward identity shown in eq.(3.1 ) , the momenta p and @xmath213 on the fermion lines in the vertex are set to be equal .",
    "according to the energy - momentum conservation , the momentum k on the photon line should be equal to zero .",
    "correspondingly , the subtraction shown in eq.(3.2 ) was carried out at the so - called asymmetric points , @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "these subtraction points coincide with the energy- momentum conservation , i.e. , the lorentz - invariance .",
    "nevertheless , the subtraction performed at the symmetric point @xmath216 was often used in the previous works @xmath217 .",
    "this subtraction not only makes the calculation too complicated , but also violates the energy- momentum conservation which holds in the vertex .",
    "that is why the symmetric point subtraction is beyond our choice .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the gms subtraction is a kind of mom scheme in which the renormalization points are chosen to be time - like .",
    "in contrast , in the conventional mom scheme@xmath218 , the renormalization points were chosen to be space - like , i.e. @xmath219 which implies @xmath220 . in this scheme ,",
    "the one - loop result for the anomalous dimension @xmath221 can be written out from eq.(4.6 ) by the transformation @xmath222 .",
    "that is @xmath223 which is identical to that given in refs.(6 ) and ( 29 ) . in comparison of eq.(6.4 ) with eq.(4.6 ) , we see , the coefficients of @xmath224 in eq.(6.4 ) changes a minus sign . substituting eq.(6.4 ) into eq.(4.1 ) and solving the latter equation , we obtain the running coupling constant which is still represented in eq.(4.11 ) , but the function @xmath225 in eq.(4.11 ) is now given by @xmath226 this expression is obviously different from the corresponding one written in eqs.(4.12 ) and ( 4.13 ) . at small distance @xmath227 , eq.(6.5 ) still gives the approximate expression presented in eq.(4.15 ) .",
    "however , at large distance , as shown in fig.(2 ) , the @xmath228 behaves almost a constant .",
    "when @xmath171 , it approaches to a value equal to 0.99986@xmath229 , unlike the @xmath228 given in eqs.(4.11)-(4.13 ) which tends to zero .",
    "let us examine the effective mass .",
    "as we have seen from sect.5 , the one - loop effective fermion mass given in the gms scheme is real .",
    "however , in the space - like momentum subtraction , due to @xmath230 , the effective mass will contain an imaginary part .",
    "this result can be seen from the function @xmath231 whose one - loop expression given in the usual mom scheme can be obtained from eq.(5.3 ) by the transformation @xmath232 and therefore becomes complex . the both of subtractions may presumably be suitable for different processes of different physical natures .",
    "but , if the effective mass is required to be real , the subtraction at space - like renormalization point should also be ruled out .    as pointed out in sect.4 ,",
    "the effective coupling constant shown in eq.(4.15 ) which was obtained in the ms scheme is only an approximation given in the large momentum limit from the viewpoint of conventional perturbation theory .",
    "why say so ? as is well - known , the ms scheme is a mass - independent renormalization scheme in which the fermion mass is set to vanish in the process of subtraction .",
    "the reasonability of this scheme was argued as follows@xmath233 .the fermion propagator can be expanded as a series @xmath234 according to this expansion , the massive propagator @xmath235 may be replaced by the massless one @xmath236 at the same time , the fermion mass , as the coupling constant , can also be treated as an expansion parameter for the perturbation series .",
    "nevertheless , in the mass - dependent renormalization as shown in this paper , the massive fermion propagator is employed in the calculation and only the coupling constant is taken to be the expansion parameter of the perturbation series .",
    "thus , in order to get the perturbative result of a given order of the coupling constant in the mass - dependent renormalization , according to eq.(6.6 ) , one has to compute an infinite number of terms in the ms scheme .",
    "if only the first term in eq.(6.6 ) is considered in the ms scheme , the result derived in the this scheme , comparing to the corresponding one obtained in the mass - dependent renormalization , can only be viewed as an approximation given in the large momentum limit . even if in this limit , a good renormalization scheme should still be required to eliminate the ambiguity and give an unique result . to this end",
    ", we may ask whether there should exist the difference between the ms scheme and the @xmath1 scheme @xmath237 ? as one knows , when the dimensional regularization is employed in the mass - independent renormalization , the ms scheme only subtracts the divergent term having the @xmath238-pole in a feynman integral which is given in the limit @xmath239 and uses this term to define the renormalization constant . while , the @xmath1 scheme is designed to include the unphysical terms @xmath240 ( here @xmath241 is the euler constant ) in the definition of the renormalization constant .",
    "the unphysical terms arise from a special analytical continuation of the space - time dimension from n to 4 . when the two different renormalization constants mentioned above are inserted into the relation @xmath242",
    ", one would derive a relation between the two different renormalized coupling constants given in the ms and @xmath1 schemes if the higher order terms containing the @xmath238-pole are ignored .",
    "it would be pointed out that the above procedure of leading to the difference between the ms and @xmath1 schemes is not appropriate because the procedure is based on direct usage of the divergent form of the renormalization constants . as emphasized in the introduction , according to the convergence principle , it is permissible to use such renormalization constants to do a meaningful calculation .",
    "the correct procedure of deriving a renormalized quantity is to solve its rge whose solution is uniquely determined by the anomalous dimension ( other than the renormalization constant itself ) and boundary condition . in computing the anomalous dimension , the rigorous procedure is to start from the regularized form of the renormalization constant . in the regularized form ,",
    "it is unnecessary and even impossible to divide a renormalization constant into a divergent part and a convergent part .",
    "since the anomalous dimension is a convergent function of @xmath238 due to that the factor @xmath243 disappears in it , the limit @xmath239 taken after the differentiation with respect to the renormalization point would give an unambiguous result . especially , the unphysical factor @xmath244 appearing in eqs.(3.25 ) , ( 3.27 ) and ( 4.5 ) straightforwardly approaches 1 in the limit .",
    "therefore , the unphysical terms @xmath245 could not enter the anomalous dimension and the effective coupling constant .",
    "even if we work in the zero - mass limit or in the large momentum regime , we have an only way to obtain the effective coupling constant as shown in eq.(4.15 ) in the one - loop approximation .",
    "that is to say , it is impossible , in this case , to result in the difference between the ms and @xmath1 schemes and also the difference between the mom and the ms schemes .",
    "the above discussions suggest that the ambiguity arising from different renormalization prescriptions may be eliminated by the necessary physical and mathematical requirements as well as the boundary conditions .",
    "it is expected that the illustration given in this paper for the qed one - loop renormalization performed in a mass - dependent scheme would provide a clue on how to do the qed multi - loop renormalization and how to give an improved result for the qcd renormalization .",
    "* acknowledgment *    the authors wish to thank professor shi - shu wu for useful discussions .",
    "this project was supposed in part by national natural science foundation .",
    "* appendix : illustration of the regularization procedure by a couple of mathematical examples *    we believe that if a quantum field theory is built up on the faithful basis of physical principles and really describes the physics , a s - matrix element computed from such a theory is definite to be convergent even though there occur divergences in the perturbation series of the matrix element .",
    "the occurrence of divergences in the perturbation series , in general , is not to be a serious problem in mathematics .",
    "but , to compute such a series , it is necessary to employ an appropriate regularization procedure .",
    "for example , for the following convergent integral @xmath246 which equals to @xmath247 , if we evaluate it by utilizing the series expansion of the exponential function @xmath248 as we see , the integral of every term in the series is divergent . in this case ,",
    "interchange of the integration with the summation actually is not permissible .",
    "when every integral in the series is regularized , the interchange is permitted and all integrals in the series become calculable . thus , the correct procedure of evaluating the integral by using the series expansion is as follows @xmath249 @xmath250 this example is somewhat analogous to the perturbation series in the quantum field theory and suggests how to do the calculation of the series with the help of a regularization procedure .",
    "unfortunately , in practice , we are not able to compute all the terms in the perturbation series . in this situation , we can only expect to get desired physical results from a finite order perturbative calculation .",
    "how to do it ? to show the procedure of such a calculation , let us look at another mathematical example .",
    "the following integral @xmath251 where @xmath252 is obviously convergent . when the exponential function is expanded as the taylor series , the integral",
    "will be expressed as @xmath253 clearly , in the above expansion , the first term is convergent , similar to the tree - approximate term in the perturbation theory of a quantum field theory , the second term is logarithmically divergent , analogous to the one - loop - approximate term and the other terms amount to the higher order corrections in the perturbation theory which are all divergent . to calculate the integral in eq.(a.4 ) , it is convenient at first to evaluate its derivative , @xmath254 which is equal to @xmath255 as is easily seen from integrating it over x by part . in order to get this result from the series expansion , we have to employ a regularization procedure .",
    "let us define @xmath256 then , corresponding to eq.(a.5 ) , we can write @xmath257=\\frac{e^{-(\\lambda + a)}}{(\\lambda + a)^2}-\\frac{e^{-a}}{a^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above result , it follows that @xmath258 this is the differential equation satisfied by the function f(a ) .",
    "its solution can be expressed as @xmath259 where @xmath260 @xmath261 is a fixed number which should be determined by the boundary condition of the equation ( a.9 ) .",
    "now , let us focus our attention on the second integral in the first equality of eq.(a.8 ) .",
    "this integral is convergent in the limit @xmath262 and can be written as @xmath263 integrating the above equation over a , we get @xmath264 if setting @xmath265 where @xmath19 is a finite number , eq.(a.12 ) becomes @xmath266 this result is finite as long as the parameter @xmath19 is not taken to be zero and can be regarded as the contribution of the divergent integral @xmath267 appearing in the second term of eq.(a.5 ) to the convergent integral f(a ) .",
    "the procedure described above for evaluating the function f(a ) much resembles the renormalization group method and the approach proposed in ref.(9 ) .",
    "it shows us how to calculate a finite quantity from its series expansion which contains divergent integrals .",
