    "since the start of the space age with the first launch of a satellite to space ( sputnik in @xmath0 ) , the interest in the study of space maneuvers that use the available resources like time and fuel efficiently has been growing steadily . in many real life cases ,",
    "a satellite can serve multiple purposes , requiring for that a change of its orbit .",
    "some maneuvering is also needed during the initial launch of a satellite , or when a spare satellite has to be brought to its intended orbit .",
    "maneuvering a satellite can be done in two different ways : continuous thrust or a sequence of instantaneous and discrete impulses .",
    "this paper focuses on the latter .",
    "the orbit transfer problem with a fixed time of flight was studied by lambert , who provided a solution in the case of two impulses . for a discussion of this problem , see @xcite .    however , the scarcest resource in space is fuel , since it represents a load on the spacecraft that can not be too large to avoid launching problems and to reduce costs .",
    "for this reason , we focus our attention on the minimum fuel transfer problem with unconstrained time . using the well - known tsiolkovsky rocket equation",
    ", we consider the sum of the individual impulses ( difference between velocities before and after the thrust is applied ) as the cost function .",
    "this usually appears in the literature as @xmath1 .    in the case of a transfer between two circular coplanar orbits ,",
    "hohmann gave an explicit solution with two impulses in  @xcite , which was later proven optimal analytically by barrar  @xcite .",
    "for the case with three impulses , hoelker and silber  @xcite have shown that a bi - elliptical transfer has a lower fuel requirement than the hohmann transfer for some special initial and final orbits .",
    "roth  @xcite extended the notion of bi - elliptical transfer to the case of two inclined orbits .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed study of transfers between two circular orbits , including out - of - plane maneuvers and also the possibility that the initial and final angular momentum point in opposite directions . in all cases ,",
    "we have proven algebraically that the hohmann transfer is optimal for two impulses .",
    "another problem of interest is transferring a satellite between predetermined points in the initial and final orbits .",
    "this situation was studied by avendao and mortari in  @xcite , where they provided a closed - form solution . here",
    ", we reobtain this solution algebraically , applying a much more efficient method . previous attempts to solve this problem involved the use of iterative methods or an equation that needs to be solved numerically ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the last problem we study is the optimal transfer between two identical ellipses that are coplanar and rotated a fixed angle .",
    "this case was studied numerically by bender in  @xcite .",
    "however , we provide an algebraic solution , which is fully explicit under a mild symmetry assumption .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec - kepler ]",
    "we have compiled all the equations of celestial mechanics that we will need in the paper . in section  [ sec - modelo ] ,",
    "we present an algebraic approach to the multi - impulse minimum - cost orbit transfer problem .",
    "we have put special emphasis in explaining the physical meaning of all the variables involved .",
    "three kinds of problems are studied : point to point , point to orbit and orbit to orbit .",
    "we also consider two possible cost functions .    in section  [ sec - am ]",
    ", we present our solution to the general point - to - point problem with two impulses and cost function as in @xcite . in section  [ sec - hohmann ] , we provide a solution to a generalized version of the hohmann transfer where out - of - plane maneuvers are allowed .",
    "finally , the orbit - to - orbit problem between identical and coplanar orbits is studied in section  [ sec - two - rot ] .",
    "the solution we obtain requires solving a large system of polynomial equations , which can be solved explicitly if we assume a symmetry condition .",
    "we have done extensive numerical tests showing that the symmetry condition is always satisfied in them .",
    "the motion of a particle in a keplerian gravitational force field is given by the solution of the second - order differential equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the standard gravitational parameter of the field , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the initial position and velocity , and @xmath6 is the position of the particle as a function of time . for any solution of eq .",

    "moreover , the total energy satisfies @xmath15 so its value can be determined from @xmath10 and @xmath11 alone when @xmath16 .",
    "the angular momentum is always orthogonal to @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 so the motion is planar . besides , it follows from eq . that @xmath19 is also constant , which is the implicit equation of a conic with one focus at the origin , eccentricity @xmath20 and semilatus rectum @xmath21 , when @xmath22 . in the case",
    "@xmath23 , i.e. when the conic is a hyperbola , the equation describes only the branch in which the particle is moving .",
    "the degenerate case @xmath24 will be discussed later in this section . finally , multiplying eq . by @xmath10 and moving some terms ,",

    "here we have @xmath31 , so @xmath4 is parallel to @xmath5 . the eccentricity vector @xmath32 is constant , so the trajectory is contained in the line through the origin with direction @xmath11 .",
    "there are two possible cases : either the initial velocity is high enough to escape the gravitational attraction of the field or the particle will first move in the direction @xmath5 until a point where its velocity becomes zero and then come back towards the origin , thus entering in a periodic motion .    to avoid the extra complexity needed to handle parabolic and hyperbolic motions , as well as",

    "a similar procedure to the one used in case 2a allows us to obtain a full solution of the equations @xmath308 from a zero of @xmath312 .",
    "the procedure is described below :    1 .",
    "calculate a root @xmath313 of @xmath314 .",
    "although @xmath312 is a polynomial of degree @xmath315 in @xmath107 , it can be factored as a product of polynomials that are either not zero by assumption or that have degree lower than @xmath271 .",

    ", we recommend that these solutions are included when looking for the best orbit transfer .      in our numerical computations , we explored a wide range of values of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , in such a way that all possible eccentricities and angles between the ellipses were considered .    when the ellipses are rotated 180 degrees , the optimal solution is always provided by eq .   of case2a .    indeed",

    "case2a given by eq .",
    "exist but are worse .    in the rest of the cases , the solution of case2a given by eq .",
    "is always the best . to check this efficiently",
    ", we used only rational values for @xmath191 and @xmath192 . the trick to achieve this is to set @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the desired eccentricity and @xmath329 and @xmath330 are integers chosen in such a way that the desired angle @xmath331 is approximately @xmath332 .",
    "in the following tests , we used @xmath333 and the pairs @xmath334 were selected to approximate the angles @xmath335 degrees .",
    "the case @xmath336 was discussed above .    for each value of @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath328 , we computed the best solution of case 1 ( solving the system numerically ) , case2a using both eq .   and eq .  , and case2b using eq .  .",
    "in total , we have explored more than a thousand test cases .",
    "we extracted several conclusions from the data we computed .",
    "first of all , the solution of case2a is indeed the best one , as we mentioned before . in figure  [ fig - caso2at1 ]",
    "we show the fuel of this transfer ( or rather , the cost function @xmath155 , which is proportional to it ) obtained as a function of @xmath328 and @xmath331 , and what this transfer would look like when @xmath337 and the angle between the ellipses is @xmath338 degrees .     of the best transfer and an example of one of these transfers .",
    "]     of the best transfer and an example of one of these transfers . ]",
    "we can also compare the angle between the semi - major axis of the initial orbit and the direction given by @xmath4 .",
    "we observe in figure  [ fig - separacion](a ) that when @xmath331 is small ( less than 40 degrees ) , this separation is higher than 50 degrees for eccentricities up to 0.5 .",
    "when @xmath331 is near 180 degrees , this separation becomes smaller ( and is zero in the case @xmath336 ) .    the separation shown above led us to study how much fuel can be saved by using our optimal transfer instead of the one from apogee to apogee .",
    "figure  [ fig - separacion](b ) shows the ratio ( in percentage ) between the fuel consumption of both transfers .",
    "( a )        ( b )    on the other hand , case1 does not always produce a valid real solution . even in those situations where case1 provides a solution ,",
    "it is always very poor compared to the ones of case2a , up to one or two orders of magnitude worse depending on the eccentricity .",
    "case2b always produces valid solutions , but they are as bad as those of case1 .    finally , the solutions of case2a given by eq .",
    "are worse than the optimal one , but they are no more than @xmath339 worse for eccentricities below @xmath340 and up to a @xmath341 worse for higher eccentricities , as shown in figure  [ fig - caso2at1vscaso2at2 ] .",
    "firstly , in section  [ sec - modelo ] we have presented an innovative approach to the study of the multi - impulse orbit transfer problem with minimum fuel , that only requires to solve a system of polynomial equations .",
    "no trigonometrical functions are needed .",
    "this allows one to use all the algebraic machinery that is currently available : grbner bases , resultants , elimination theory , root isolation , etc . , which was not possible with the previous formulations of the problem .    in section  [ sec - am ] we provided an alternative method for solving the point - to - point two - dimensional orbit transfer problem studied in  @xcite by avendao and mortari",
    "the significant advantage of our new approach is the efficiency of the computation , since only arithmetic operations are used .",
    "moreover , in section  [ sec - hohmann ] we used the well - known hohmann transfer problem between two circular orbits , to show the power of our technique .",
    "we worked under very general assumptions , i.e. letting the transfer orbit to be out of plane , but we showed that the best transfer is indeed coplanar .",
    "the novelty of our analysis is that we allowed the initial and final orbits to have angular momentum pointing in opposite directions .",
    "even for such an extreme case , the classical solution is proven optimal .    furthermore , in section  [ sec - two - rot ] we analyzed in depth the problem of changing between two identical elliptical orbits of eccentricity @xmath328 which are coplanar and rotated a certain angle @xmath331 .",
    "here we restricted our search to transfer orbits that are coplanar with the other two . the first surprising result that we got",
    "is that the optimal transfer does not go from apogee to apogee ( except when @xmath342 ) , but it is separated from the apogee a certain variable angle that depends on  @xmath328 and  @xmath331 .",
    "this angle is higher than @xmath343 degrees when @xmath344 and @xmath345 deg . for lower eccentricities and small values of @xmath331",
    ", the separation angle can be as large as @xmath346 degrees .",
    "the large difference between the best transfer orbit and the best one from apogee to apogee means also a significant difference in the fuel consumption of both maneuvers . for angles @xmath331 up to @xmath346 degrees , the savings obtained by using our transfer orbit are always higher than @xmath347 , and for angles @xmath348 , our transfer consumes less than half of the fuel needed to go from apogee to apogee .    finally , solving the problem has been reduced to the study of several subproblems , each of which consists of a set of polynomial equations .",
    "all but one of the subproblems have been solved symbolically , which means that an explicit solution is available given any initial and final orbits .",
    "the remaining subproblem can be solved numerically for any given data , but the optimal solution does not seem to come from this particular subcase . indeed , numerical evidence suggests that the optimal solution always comes from the same subcase , for which we have a symbolic solution .",
