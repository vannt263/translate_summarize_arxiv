    "the question of a possible existence of an ultra - violet stable fixed point in qed was investigated long ago by gell@xmath7mann and low @xcite and developed later by several authors @xcite .",
    "if such a point were to exist , then the electron mass would be entirely dynamical in origin @xcite , with a possible spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "although perturbation theory calculations do not seem to point to the existence of such a solution , quenched lattice qed calculations displayed the existence of a phase transition at the critical value @xmath8 of the coupling constant @xmath0 , with the occurrence of a spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "these observations were also confirmed with unquenched lattice calculations @xcite , with @xmath9 , but a vanishing of the callan - symanzik function @xmath10 was not found there and the question of the validity of qed as a nontrivial consistent theory in the continuum limit was raised .    on the other hand , it is possible , in the continuum theory , to analyze a partial , but simpler , aspect of the phase transition problem , namely that of the bound state of strongly coupled positronium .",
    "if the ground state of the corresponding spectrum , for some value of @xmath0 , were massless , then this would be the signal of a possible spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry and the prelude of a phase transition in qed .",
    "this result would not be , however , sufficient by itself to ensure the vanishing of the callan - symanzik @xmath11-function , which should be shown by independent calculations ; only in this case could the consistency of the whole procedure be guaranteed .",
    "we studied , in previous work @xcite , the problem of strongly coupled positronium in the framework of relativistic quantum constraint dynamics ( rqcd ) @xcite .",
    "this framework provides a manifestly covariant three - dimensional description of the internal motion of two - body systems and can be shown to be equivalent to a three - dimensional reduction of the bethe@xmath7salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "when the approximation of local potentials is made , the corresponding wave equations can be analyzed rather easily and in many cases analytic solutions can be obtained .",
    "it was found that the todorov form of the electromagnetic two - body potential , first introduced in the quasipotential approach @xcite , leads to the existence of a critical value of the coupling constant , with @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the potential becomes too singular and needs some regularization , provided by a cut - off radius @xmath14 in the coulomb interaction . in the regularized theory the bound state",
    "mass spectrum displays , for @xmath15 , a rapid fall of the ground state mass to values close to zero , thus indicating a drastic modification of the qualitative features of the bound system and presumably of the theory itself .",
    "the above procedure requires , however , a numerical treatment of the equations and makes it difficult to ascertain the existence of solutions for vanishing values of @xmath14 .",
    "the presence of a cut - off radius in the coulomb interaction needs , in general , an adequate interpretation . as long as one studies the behavior of charged particles in supercritical coulomb fields of heavy nuclei , the finite size of the latter naturally regularizes the coulomb interaction at short distances .",
    "if , on the other hand , it is the strong interaction of pointlike particles that is considered , as in the case of positronium in qed with strong coulomb coupling , then the meaning of @xmath16 remains unclear .",
    "a similar problem also occurs with the bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , when the coupling constant @xmath0 is larger than a critical value @xmath6 ( @xmath17 in the landau gauge and @xmath18 in the feynman gauge ) , the theory undergoes spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry . however , for @xmath19 , the treatment and resolution of the equation necessitate the use of an ultra - violet cut - off @xmath20 . while the introduction of the latter can naturally be justified in qcd as being an approximate way of parametrizing the asymptotic freedom of the theory @xcite , it has not received a simple interpretation in qed . in this respect ,",
    "miransky _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that , for @xmath21 , qed undergoes an additional charge renormalization that absorbs the infinities of the pointlike limit ; the renormalized charge remains equal to @xmath6 and then might be identified with the ultra - violet fixed point of qed .",
    "it was also pointed out in this connection @xcite that , for @xmath22 , because of the new renormalization of @xmath0 , the fermion composite operator @xmath23 acquires the dimension 2 instead of 3 , and thus allows for the presence of renormalizable four - fermion interactions .    in quantum mechanics",
    ", there exists an alternative method for dealing with singular interactions of pointlike particles , without the need of introducing cut - offs : this is the self - adjoint extension method , discussed a long time ago for singular potentials of the type @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) by case @xcite . in his classic paper ,",
    "case showed that all self - adjoint extensions of the klein - gordon - coulomb ( or dirac - coulomb ) problem can be parametrized by a single constant @xmath26 when the interaction becomes singular .    while case s method is only of academic interest for problems concerning supercritical coulomb fields of heavy nuclei , the size of the latter providing a natural short distance cut - off , it reveals its full power in the present problem of strong coulomb interaction of pointlike particles .",
    "the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath26 can be interpreted as parametrizing the short distance behavior of the interaction and its choice amounts to fixing the energy of one of the bound states ( the values of the masses of the constituent particles of the bound states and of the coupling constant @xmath0 being already fixed ) and calculating the other bound state energies with respect to this one , without making explicit cut - offs appear .    in the case of @xmath27-function interactions in two and three space dimensions ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the self - adjoint extension method provides the renormalized version of the theory , when the cut - off of the regularized theory is removed and a corresponding renormalization of the coupling constant is performed .",
    "it is then natural to expect from the same method of approach , applied now to the @xmath28 singularity , to also provide the finite renormalized version of the theory , provided one of the bound state energies is fixed .    motivated by these results , we have investigated with case s method of self - adjoint extension the problem of strong coulomb coupling in positronium - like systems .",
    "the relativistic wave equations of constraint theory lead for the relative motion in @xmath29 states to a final three - dimensional equation which is very similar in form to the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation @xcite , and therefore case s method can be readily applied to it .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "we find that the system undergoes a first - order chiral phase transition at the critical value @xmath30 .",
    "while the ground state mass for @xmath31 can be continued to the domain @xmath32 and remains different from zero , a new set of an infinite number of states , concentrated in a finite domain of mass with accumulation at the value zero , appears , the zero mass state representing the new ground state of the system .",
    "this result occurs for any fixed value of case s constant @xmath26 .",
    "all the states have indefinitely oscillating wave functions near the origin .",
    "while tachyonic solutions formally exist , they are ruled out from the spectrum by the self - adjointness condition , and therefore the zero mass state remains the physical ground state of the spectrum .    in the limit @xmath33 from above ,",
    "the short - distance oscillations disappear from the wave functions , and the states accumulated around the zero mass solution shrink to a single massless state with a definite mass gap with the rest of the spectrum .",
    "it turns out that the latter state has the required properties to represent a goldstone boson and hence to signal a spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "the fact that for @xmath2 a sensible theory , with finite and nonvanishing couplings to the observable currents , can be defined only for @xmath34 strongly suggests the identification of @xmath6 with an ultra - violet stable fixed point of qed , with the distinction between two phases , governed by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , and joined to each other by a first - order chiral phase transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses case s method for klein - gordon particles in an external coulomb field and is included to make the paper self - contained .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study , in the framework of rqcd , of the strongly coupled positronium spectrum in its pseudoscalar sector .",

    "the contribution of the one - photon exchange diagram , besides kinematic factors , is represented in the three - dimensional theory by @xmath274 , which means that no distinction was made between the large- and short - distance behaviors of the effective charge ( the physical coupling constant @xmath0 being , in general , determined from the large distance behavior of the photon propagator ) . in order to be able to determine the domains of each of the above phases with respect to the values of the physical coupling constant , we define the effective charge in four - dimensional momentum space @xcite as @xmath275 ; @xmath276 is the lorentz invariant part of the transverse part of the photon propagator multiplied by @xmath277 ; @xmath0 is the physical coupling constant , measured at large distances : @xmath278 .",

    "the todorov potential , used in the present approach , takes into account multi - photon exchange diagrams and correctly reproduces the physical positronium and muonium spectra to order @xmath301 @xcite ; this is not the case for the ladder approximation of the bethe@xmath7salpeter equation in covariant gauges .",
    "in the course of the present analysis , the effects of anomalies were ignored ; these are known to modify the ward identities of the axial vector current @xcite . however , in qed , it turns out that these effects disappear at zero momentum transfer @xcite and hence they do not seem to be able to give a mass to the goldstone boson , when the latter exists .",
