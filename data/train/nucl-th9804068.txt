    "the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments done with neutrino beams can now provide data with an accuracy comparable to the analogous processes studied with charged leptons @xcite . due to the low cross sections , for neutrino interaction with matter , these data are collected mostly from experiments done on heavy nuclei like iron @xcite .    since the discovery of the emc effect @xcite , the deviation of the nuclear structure function @xmath2 with respect to the deuteron , many theoretical attempts were made to explain it ( for a review see @xcite ) . in the conventional nuclear physics models ,",
    "the usual effects considered are fermi motion @xcite and binding of the nucleons in the nuclei @xcite and the contribution of the virtual meson cloud @xcite .    for the neutrino processes ,",
    "the study of possible nuclear effects has received much less attention , probably because of the lack of accurate measurements in the past . in present analyses of neutrino experiments ,",
    "the high @xmath3 data ( @xmath4 ) , where fermi motion effects are expected to be important @xcite , are generally avoided , especially in the case of nuclear data @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that even in the case of the deuteron , the fermi motion effects could be important @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the older fits of diemoz et al .",
    "@xcite , show that even for lower @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) , the nuclear effects could be important .",
    "most of the analyses done for the neutrino data assume the same nuclear corrections as applicable to the charged lepton experiments in their global fits of the parton distributions @xcite , while allowing for an overall normalisation of the data .",
    "this is not appropriate for the parity violating structure function @xmath6 , in the neutrino scattering data , which has no counterpart in the charged lepton case . even in the case of the structure function @xmath7 , which is related to the @xmath8 , of the emc effect",
    ", the nuclear corrections would not be the same due to the different contribution of the sea quarks @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been some calculations of the nuclear effects in the @xmath6 structure function @xcite .",
    "it is found by sidorov and tokarev ( st ) @xcite that the nuclear effects in @xmath9 are quite small in the case of the deuteron , a result similar to the one found in charged lepton scattering in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "keeping in view the result that the nuclear effects in @xmath11 are quite different for the deuteron and heavy nuclei , the assumption that they are the same for @xmath9 , as done by st is therefore not justified .    in the calculation of kulagin @xcite , the iron structure function",
    "is evaluated and sizeable deviations from the deuteron one were found . the effect on the gross - llewellyn smith ( gls ) sum rule",
    "@xcite is on the contrary very small .",
    "this is so because in kulagin s approach , the spinors are normalized in order not to affect this sum rule .",
    "it is similar to the prescription introduced by means of the so called flux factor @xcite in order to take into account relativistic effects in non relativistic formalisms .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the fit that the ccfr collaboration made to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 neutrino data @xcite , the integral of the valence quark distributions is not 3 , @xcite .",
    "this apparent lack of normalization of the @xmath14 in the nuclear data is of crucial importance in order to extract the strong coupling constant , @xmath15 , from the analysis of the gls sum rule , as done in @xcite .",
    "recently , a new calculation of the nuclear effects in the case of the charged lepton scattering was made @xcite . in this calculation a relativistic many - body approach for the nucleon contribution was developed in order to avoid the use of the flux factor mentioned before @xcite .",
    "the meson cloud contribution was found to give relatively important contributions .",
    "good agreement was found with the experimental data .",
    "for the structure function @xmath14 , the virtual meson cloud gives no contribution , since it is related to the difference of the quark and antiquark distributions . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the nuclear effects to @xmath14 in the same formalism of @xcite .",

    "similarities in the region of @xmath114 , where the ratio shows a fast increase , are also apparent , and they are mostly due to the effect of fermi motion @xcite . the differences between the neutrino and charged lepton ratios are more important at values of @xmath115 .",
    "these differences are mostly due to the lack of meson renormalization effects in the neutrino structure function , as can be seen in the figure , where we also show the results for @xmath112 without the meson renormalization effects",
    ".    we should note that the nuclear effects are sizeable , with values of @xmath116 around 0.8 in the region of @xmath117 and around 0.9 for low values of @xmath3 .",
    "these nuclear corrections are considerably larger than those found for the deuteron @xcite , as it was also the case for @xmath112 in the charged lepton case .    in fig .",
    "4 we show results for @xmath116 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that for low values of @xmath3 the results for @xmath116 are rather independent of @xmath1 , but this is not the case at large values of @xmath3 , where there are substantial differences .",
    "given the fact that the most important contribution to the gls sum rule comes from the values of @xmath118 , the results of the figure indicate that nuclear effects can reduce the gls sum by about 10% .",
    "since one of the purposes of this work is to facilitate the task of experimentalists in analyses of the gls sum rule and other qcd predictions for @xmath110 , we provide here an easy parametrization of @xmath116 which can serve to induce the results for @xmath110 from the measured nuclear data of @xmath90 . in table",
    "i we give the parameters of a fit of the ratio @xmath119 for the @xmath1 values of 5 , 30 and 50 gev@xmath120 .",
    "the form used is @xmath121 . for larger values of @xmath1 results",
    "are similar to those for 50 gev@xmath120 .",
    "we also want to stress that the factor @xmath122 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ finalf3 ] ) which goes to unity in the bjorken limit ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) , is not negligible for values of @xmath123 and produces changes of around 10% in @xmath116 for values of @xmath124 at @xmath125 gev@xmath120 .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare our results with those of kulagin @xcite and st @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear that both for the case of kulagin and the present results the differences with the deuteron results of st are significant .",
    "our results and those of kulagin are qualitatively similar around @xmath126 , but they divert from each other both at large @xmath3 and small @xmath3 .",
    "the discrepancies at large @xmath3 are not surprising since it was shown in @xcite that the results for @xmath127 at large @xmath3 were very sensitive to the parametrization used for @xmath128 , which is different in @xcite and the present case .",
    "these differences , however , should not be very relevant for tests of the gls sum rule , since the contribution to the sum rule from the region of @xmath114 is very small .",
    "the discrepancies for values of @xmath118 are more relevant in connection with this sum rule since 10% effects , typical differences at low @xmath3 between both approaches , are of the same order of magnitude as the qcd corrections to the gls . the main reason for the discrepancies in the two results should be seen from the different approaches followed . in @xcite",
    "the spinors are normalized in a way to force baryon number conservation in a non relativistic formalism , in line of the idea of the flux factor of @xcite to introduce relativistic corrections in a nonrelativistic formalism .",
    "the advantage of the present work is that it uses a relativistic formalism from the beginning , in which baryon number conservation is automatically fulfilled .",
    "the differences of 10% in the region of small @xmath3 between the two aproaches is about the same one as found between our approach and those using the flux factor in studies of @xmath129 @xcite .    in summary , we present here results for @xmath116 based on a relativistic approach and the use of an accurate nuclear spectral function which reproduces nuclear bindings , momentum distributions , etc . within this formalism",
    "we were able to reproduce the emc effect for different nuclei and the experimental results of @xmath127 in the region of @xmath130 .",
    "we have used here the same formalism to evaluate @xmath90 .",
    "there are some differences with respect to @xmath127 in the nuclear effects , mostly due to the absence of meson renormalization corrections in @xmath90 .",
    "the results obtained are parametrized in an easy way to facilitate future analyses of experimentalists in order to deduce the elementary @xmath110 structure function from the nuclear measurements and be able to test qcd corrections and obtain reliable values of @xmath15 .",
