    "equivalently , any zonotope @xmath65 is a projection of some cube of dimension @xmath66 .    in @xmath67",
    "there is a rigid form @xmath38 that is not a form of rank @xmath55 .",

    "for example the primitive venkov graph for elongated dodecahedron is shown on the left part of the figure [ vengraph ] .",
    "and the right part of this figure shows examples of half - belt cycle ( the blue cycle ) and trivially contractible cycle ( the green cycle ) .",
    "[ graphcycles ] to show that theorem @xmath74 is true for @xmath0 it is enough to check that abelian group of cycles of the graph @xmath71 is generated by the set @xmath73 of gain cycles .",
    "it is easy to see that every cycle on @xmath31 can be represented as product of cycles in @xmath71 ( we can just write down sequence of facets of @xmath0 , i.e. vertices of @xmath71 ) and two cycles are homologically equivalent with rational coefficients if and only if they can be transformed into each other by products on trivially contractible cycles .",

    "so to get the full picture of this case it is enough to take the delone tiling of the lattice @xmath68 ( we will denote it as @xmath77 ) and describe all rank one forms that can be added to this tiling .",
    "the @xmath70-cell is the convex hull of @xmath70 points : all @xmath78 points of the form @xmath79 and @xmath80 points with three coordinates equal to @xmath14 and one to @xmath81 ( i.e. permutations of @xmath82 ) .",
    "this polytope is the dirichlet - voronoi polytopes for the lattice @xmath83    the correspondent delone tiling @xmath77 consist three families of regular crosspolytopes @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "so by theorem [ onecone ] correspondent delone tilings can be obtained be slicing the tiling @xmath77 with several families of hyperplanes .",
    "we can use the classification of frank vallentin ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.4.5 ) and obtain the following :    each ( non - zonotopal ) delone tiling can be obtained from the tiling into three families of crosspolytopes @xmath91 with slicing it with several family of parallel hyperplanes without creating new vertices .",
    "these new hyperplanes satisfies the following properties :    1 .   each family of hyperplanes slice only one family of crosspolytopes .",
    "each family of crosspolytopes can be sliced with upto three families of hyperplanes .",
    "if we slice tiling @xmath77 with a family of hyperplanes @xmath92 then every crosspolytope should be sliced by its `` equator '' ( i.e. three pairs of opposite vertices ) or should not sliced at all . due to symmetry with respect to symmetry group of @xmath68 it",
    "is enough to consider only one family of hyperplanes that slices one of crosspolytopes .",
    "without loss of generality we can assume that the crosspolytope @xmath93 is sliced with the hyperplane @xmath94 .",

    "one can easily check that @xmath92 slice every crosspolytope from the family @xmath86 and slice no crosspolytopes from other families .",
    "so the first assertion of the proposition is done .",
    "the second point is also quite clear .",
    "if we have more than three families of hyperplanes that slice @xmath96 then we will get new vertices of the tiling in the centers of crosspolytopes from @xmath96 . and",
    "this is forbidden since the set of vertices of the tiling ( i.e. lattice ) should remain the same .",
    "[ nonzonthm ] if @xmath0 is a four - dimensional parallelohedron that contains affine image of @xmath70-cell as minkowski summand ( i.e. if correspondent delone tiling is an affine image of a refinement of @xmath77 ) then the theorem @xmath74 is valid for @xmath0 .",
    "first we describe what will happen with one crosspolytope @xmath97 if we slice it one , two or three times .",
    "one hyperplane cuts @xmath97 into two pyramids over octahedra ( i.e. three - dimensional crosspolytopes ) .",
    "so the only other face added to delone triagulation will be one three - dimensional crosspolytope ( we will not describe additional four - dimensional tiles ) .",
    "the second hyperplane cuts each pyramid into doubly iterated pyramids over squares ( i.e. pyramid over pyramid over square ) .",
    "so this construction adds one two - dimensional quadrangular face ( bases of all four pyramids ) and four three - dimensinal pyramidal faces ( pyramids over squares ) to the initial four - dimensional crosspolytope .",
    "the third hyperplane cuts @xmath97 into eight simplices with common edge .",
    "the new faces of the tiling are : one edge , eight triangles , and twelve tetrahedra .",
    "so after the third cut of a single crosspolytope there will be again only tetrahedral three - dimensional faces .",
    "if each family is cut one or three times , or left uncut then all two - dimensional faces of delone tiling are triangular and correspondent voronoi polytope @xmath0 satisfies the theorem of zhitomirskii [ zhitthm ] . in this case there are no non - primitive faces of codimension @xmath17 and @xmath98 and its rational homologies are trivial",
    ". therefore the theorem [ homologies ] holds for @xmath0 .",
