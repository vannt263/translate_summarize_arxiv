    "the high level of anomalous transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas is still an unresolved issue in the quest for controlled fusion .",
    "furthermore , a deterministic description of intermittent events in plasma turbulence is improper due to the stochastic nature of the transport exhibiting non - local interactions as well as non - gaussian probability density functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the pdfs of heat and particle flux display uni - modal non - gaussian features which is the signature of intermittent turbulence with patchy spatial structure that is bursty in time .",
    "the turbulent behavior in magnetically confined plasmas is the main ingredient in the anomalously high transport of heat , particles and momentum visible in present days large experiments .",
    "one crucial component of the turbulent transport is the so - called ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) driven turbulence .",
    "the itg turbulence is found to be bursty in nature where a significant part of the transport is carried by large avalanche - like events . more specifically , exponential scalings are often observed in the pdf tails in magnetic confinement experiments , and intermittency at the edge strongly influences the overall global particle and heat transport .",
    "in particular it may for instance influence the threshold for the high confinement mode ( h - mode ) in tokamak experiments @xcite . in view of these experimental results , theories built on average transport coefficients and",
    "gaussian statistics fall short in predicting vital transport processes .",
    "there is a considerable amount of experimental evidence @xcite and recent numerical gyrokinetic @xcite and fluid simulations @xcite that plasma turbulence in tokamaks is highly non - local .",
    "a satisfactorily understanding of the non - local signatures as well as the ever - present non - gaussian pdfs of transport @xcite found in experiments and numerical simulations is still lacking .    an attractive candidate for explaining",
    "the non - local features of itg turbulence is by inclusion of a fractional velocity operator in the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation @xcite yielding a non - local description that have non - gaussian pdfs of heat and particle flux .",
    "the fractional operator introduces an inherently non - local description with strongly non - maxwellian features of the distribution function resulting in significant modification of the transport process .",
    "the non - locality is introduced through the integral description of the fractional derivative @xcite .",
    "there are a number of other phenomenological studies of the effects of fractional derivative models . using fractional generalizations of the liouville equation",
    ", kinetic descriptions have been developed previously @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the chaotic dynamics can be described by using the fp equation with coordinate fractional derivatives as a possible tool for the description of anomalous diffusion @xcite and much work has been devoted on investigation of the langevin equation with lvy white noise , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , or related fractional fp equation . furthermore",
    ", fractional derivatives have been introduced into the fp framework in a similar manner @xcite as the present work however a study on itg modes is still lacking .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the lvy statistics into a langevin equation which yields a fractional fp description . in order to calculate an equilibrium pdf we use a model based on the motion of a charged lvy particle in a constant external magnetic field obeying non - gaussian , lvy statistics .",
    "this assumption is the natural generalization of the classical example of the motion of a charged brownian particle with the usual gaussian statistics .",
    "the fractional derivative is represented with the fourier transform containing a fractional exponent . here , we extend the work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to include the effects of finite temperature gradients and non - adiabatic electrons leading to a fractional description of the non - local effects in itg turbulent transport in a gyrokinetic framework .",
    "we quantify the non - local effects in terms of a modified dispersion relation for linear itg modes . we have considered a case with constant external magnetic field and a shear - less slab geometry .",
    "the characteristics of the itg modes are fundamentally changed , i.e. , the values of the growth rate and real frequency are significantly altered by the order of the fractional derivative @xmath0 . however , the relative effect of the fractional derivative is larger on the real frequency than on the growth rate of the itg mode .",
    "this is different from the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where the growth rate was increased strongly as the plasma deviated from @xmath1 limit ( maxwellian ) .",
    "we have found that the basis of this difference is due to the different assumptions on the electrons : adiabatic and non - adiabatic electrons are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the present work , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we present the mathematical framework of the fractional fp equation ( ffpe ) which is used to derive a dispersion relation for the itg modes while retaining the non - local interactions . in the next section , the deviations from a maxwellian distribution function are investigated and the dispersion relation is solved .",
    "we conclude the paper with a results and discussion section .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the ffpe with fractional velocity derivatives in shear - less slab geometry in the presence of a constant external force can be written as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the particle species and @xmath4 . here , the term @xmath5 is the fractional riesz derivative .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath6 , is related to the damping term @xmath7 , according to a generalized einstein relation @xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a generalized temperature , and force @xmath10 represents the lorentz force ( due to a constant magnetic field and a zero - averaged electric field ) acting on the particles of species @xmath11 with mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the solution of the equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , i.e. the generalized equilibrium distribution , for a general @xmath0 can be obtained as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and we have introduced a generalized thermal velocity as @xmath16 using the generalized equilibrium distribution expressed in equation ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) , we will now quantify the non - local effects on drift waves induced by the fractional differential operator by determining the dispersion relation for itg driven drift modes .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath17 we assume that the turbulence is purely electrostatic and neglect magnetic field fluctuations @xmath18 . for small deviations from the local equilibrium we find the linearized gyro - kinetic equation of the form @xmath19f_{s}(x , v_{\\parallel},v_{\\bot})j_{0}(|\\omega_{s}|^{-1}k_{\\bot}v_{\\bot})\\delta \\phi_{\\mathbf{k}}(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath20 . evaluating explicitly the derivatives of the distribution function in equation ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) , we obtain the following relations : @xmath21f_{s}(x,\\mathbf{v})+\\frac{e_s}{t_{s,\\alpha}}\\omega_{*\\mathbf{k}}^s\\times\\nonumber\\\\ \\{\\frac{n_{s}(x)}{2\\pi^{3/2}\\sqrt{2\\mathcal{d } } } \\int \\frac{d\\mathbf{k}_{\\bot}^{v}d\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{v}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2}}[-\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{\\alpha}(|\\mathbf{k}^{v}_{\\bot}|^{\\alpha}+|\\mathbf{k}^{v}_{\\parallel}|^{\\alpha})\\frac{d\\;ln\\;t_{s,\\alpha}(x)}{d x}]e^{-i(\\mathbf{k}_{\\bot}^{v}\\mathbf{v}_{\\bot}+\\mathbf{k}_{\\parallel}^{v}\\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel})}e^{-\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{\\alpha}(|\\mathbf{k}^{v}_{\\bot}|^{\\alpha}+|\\mathbf{k}^{v}_{\\parallel}|^{\\alpha})}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and we assumed that the space dependence of @xmath25 is only in the @xmath26 direction perpendicular to the magnetic field as well as for the density gradient . in the equation above , @xmath27 is the bessel function of order zero , @xmath28 is the parallel velocity , @xmath29 is the perpendicular velocity and hence we write the total speed as @xmath30 .",
