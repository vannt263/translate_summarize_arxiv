    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of strong interactions that successfully describes a wealth of experimentally observed phenomena . at high energies the coupling of the theory runs to zero @xcite , making interactions between the constituents of the theory ( quarks and gluons ) weaker , eventually approaching the limit of non - interacting ideal gas .    in the region of low energies ( up to a few hundred mev )",
    "the coupling of the theory is of @xmath5 ( thus justifying the name strong interactions ) and the perturbation theory is not reliable . in this phase of the theory the degrees of freedom",
    "are hadrons , while quarks and gluons are confined into objects with zero net color charge .",
    "the outlined picture suggests that at some temperature a transition from the confined hadronic phase to the deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase takes place @xcite .",
    "creating conditions for achieving qgp has been the subject of recent experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite at the brookhaven national laboratory and is going to be the goal of the future heavy - ion program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite at cern .    since the physics of the hadronic phase and the transition to qgp is essentially non - perturbative , lattice qcd techniques have been extensively applied to its studies @xcite .",
    "putting fermions on the lattice leads to the infamous fermion doubling problem , and several lattice fermion formulations deal with it in different ways .",
    "improved staggered fermion formulations are widely used to study qcd at non - zero temperatures and densities , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews , for , at least , two reasons : they preserve a part of the chiral symmetry of the continuum qcd which allows one to study the chiral aspects of the finite temperature transition , and are relatively inexpensive to simulate numerically because due to absence of an additive mass renormalization the dirac operator is bounded from below . however , there are at least two problems with staggered fermion formulation .",
    "the first one is the validity of the rooting procedure , i.e. the way to reduce the number of tastes ( unwanted unphysical degrees of freedom that result from fermion doubling ) from four to one , and the other is breaking of the taste symmetry at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the discussion of the validity of rooted staggered fermions is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . to reduce the taste violations smeared links , i.e.",
    "weighted averages of different paths on the lattice that connect neighboring points , are used in the staggered dirac operator and several improved staggered formulations , like p4 , asqtad , stout and hisq differ in the choice of the smeared gauge links . the ones in the p4 and asqtad actions are linear combinations of single links and different staples @xcite and therefore are not elements of the su(3 ) group .",
    "it is known that projecting the smeared gauge fields onto the su(3 ) group greatly improves the taste symmetry @xcite .",
    "the stout action @xcite and the hisq action implement the projection of the smeared gauge field onto su(3 ) ( or simply u(3 ) ) group and thus achieve better taste symmetry at a given lattice spacing .",
    "for studying qcd at high temperature it is important to use discretization schemes which improve the quark dispersion relation , thus eliminating the tree level @xmath6 lattice artifacts in thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the p4 and asqtad actions implement this improvement by introducing 3-link terms in the staggered dirac operator . in this paper",
    "we report on exploratory studies of qcd thermodynamics with the hisq action which combines the removal of tree level @xmath6 lattice artifacts with the addition of projected smeared links that greatly improve the taste symmetry .",
    "we also compare our results with the previous ones obtained with the asqtad , p4 and stout actions @xcite at comparable quark masses and lattice spacings as well as with the asqtad action at smaller quark masses and larger @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action developed by the hpqcd / ukqcd collaboration @xcite reduces taste symmetry breaking and decreases the splitting between different pion tastes by a factor of about three compared to the asqtad action .",
    "the net result , as recent scaling studies show @xcite , is that a hisq ensemble at lattice spacing @xmath8 has scaling violations comparable to ones in an asqtad ensemble at lattice spacing @xmath9 .    in this exploratory study",
    "we used the hisq action in the fermion sector and the tree - level symanzik improved gauge action without the tadpole improvement .",

    "runs were performed on @xmath15 lattices at zero temperature and @xmath16 at finite temperature , and in the second set on @xmath17 and @xmath18 lattices , correspondingly . to estimate the cutoff effects we have also generated a set of high - temperature ensembles on @xmath19 lattices along the @xmath11 lcp .",

    "typically , at least 300 tus were discarded for equilibration at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "the lattice spacing has been determined by measuring the static quark anti - quark potential . as in previous studies by the milc collaboration the static potential was calculated fixing the coulomb gauge and considering temporal wilson lines of different extent . forming the ratio of these correlators and fitting them to constant plus linear ansatz we extracted the static potential @xmath20 .",
