    "massless overlap fermions  @xcite have provided us with a fermionic definition of topological charge  @xcite .",
    "this offers the advantage that , by truncating to the overlap modes with @xmath2 , the effect of ultraviolet filtering can be studied  @xcite without changing the gauge field itself . a broad study of different aspects of vacuum structure ,",
    "so far for quenched qcd , has been published recently  @xcite . on the other hand , during the 80 s procedures of cooling or smearing of gauge fields were proposed to exhibit the infrared structure of gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "this has been considered with reservations because it is difficult to assess in which aspect the gauge field configuration could have changed under this procedure .",
    "the practitioners of cooling / smearing , in particular those who were focussing on vacuum structure in the form of extended , smooth ( semiclassical ) structures , have continued to improve their techniques : cooling with improved actions  @xcite , restricted improved cooling  @xcite etc ) .",
    "over - improved cooling  @xcite has been applied in order to prevent instantons or other topological excitations from collapsing .",
    "more recently , the concept of cooling / smearing has been modified in another direction , to make it differentiable with respect to the unsmeared field .",
    "the so - called stout - link smearing  @xcite makes it possible to evaluate the `` force '' for the molecular dynamics in non - quenched update algorithms with a fermionic action involving some form of `` fat '' ( smeared ) links substituting the original gauge links .",
    "the concept of over - improvement has also recently been applied to stout - link smearing  @xcite .    in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite we want to characterize the subsequent mapping `` link @xmath3 stout link '' as a particular relaxation scheme , eventually leading to a finally classical configuration . one obvious way to discuss this process is to record the local distribution of topological charge density expressed by an improved  @xcite gluonic definition of field strength and topological density .",
    "in this paper we shall compare the emergent structures with the topological density provided by the overlap definition  @xcite with different levels of ultraviolet filtering .",
    "surprisingly , the overlap topological charge density without filtering , that recently has been found to form lower - dimensional structures  @xcite , corresponds to few steps of smearing .",
    "this comparison will lead us to a one - to - one mapping of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath0 ( mode truncation in the overlap picture ) to the number of stout - link smearing iterations over a wide range of smearing iterations . in a similar spirit",
    ", the correspondence of ape smearing  @xcite , laplacian filtering  @xcite and the topological density filtered according to another ginsparg - wilson dirac operator  @xcite has been studied recently  @xcite .",
    "only a few iterations of stout - link smearing are necessary before structures become recognizable with the gluonic definition of the topological density , and these structures are surprisingly far from 4d extended , sign - coherent lumps , such that the topological density compares well with the unfiltered overlap definition .",
    "we have two criteria to establish this relation between smearing and filtering .",
    "first , it is the behavior of the two - point correlation function of the topological density that emerges from the respective definition .",
    "the second is the actual site - by - site difference of the topological density profile over a set of lattice configurations .",
    "the quality of the latter coincidence is surprisingly good , which supports the reliability of both methods to explore the vacuum structure .",
    "finally , however , this relation becomes loose because stout - link smearing turns the configurations into piecewise classical fields which apparently resemble instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "although the coherence among the lowest overlap modes guarantees a relatively simple picture of the fermionic topological density and the ultraviolet filtered gluonic field strength with low cutoff @xmath0  @xcite , there is no argument as to why the overlap picture should be in correspondence to a ( linkwise ) classical lattice configuration .",
    "it is intriguing to see that the instanton - like structure that is revealed in this late stage of smearing corresponds to the overlap zero mode(s ) and the lowest pair(s ) of overlap non - zeromodes obtained for the respective unsmeared ( equilibrium ) configuration .",
    "a similar observation has already been made by negele _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite some of us have presented a cluster analysis of individual eigenmodes of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "it turns out that the moderate number of clusters that the zero and first non - zero modes consist of ( at a level of scalar density below the peak values ) are pointing towards the positions where instantons and anti - instantons appear later .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : technicalities ] we explain briefly the overlap operator and the stout - link smearing procedure , in section [ sec : matching ] we describe the matching between smearing and ultraviolet filtering , according to the two - point correlator and according to a global fitting of the profile of charge . in section [ sec : cluster ] we try to relate the clusters that both definitions exhibit to each other . in the final stadium of smearing",
    "we shall confront the emergent semiclassical lumps with the lowest eigenmodes ( zero mode and lowest non - zero mode ) of the original configurations . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw conclusions and give an outlook .",
    "the configurations underlying this comparison stem from an extended investigation published in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the configurations are taken from an ensemble of @xmath4 quenched lattices generated with the tadpole improved lscher - weisz action at @xmath5 .",
    "the ( massless ) overlap dirac operator is constructed for the wilson - dirac input kernel @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the massless wilson - dirac operator with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding solution of the ginsparg - wilson relation reads as follows @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "circa 150 overlap eigenmodes have been obtained per configuration . they have been used to construct ultraviolet smeared topological densities according to a cut - off @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for half of the subset of 10 configurations particularly considered in the present study we have also calculated for refs .",
    "@xcite the overlap topological density without mode truncation , the `` all - scale '' topological density .",
    "the spectrum eventually consists of some zero modes , in addition to pairs of non - zero modes of globally vanishing chirality .",

    "we shall point out that the above - mentioned family of densities is well represented by the gluonic topological density after an appropriate number of iterations of stout - link smearing .      in refs .",
    "@xcite two of us have motivated the stout - link smearing with respect to a specific over - improved action .",
    "the concept of over - improved action arose from the observation that the wilson one - plaquette action does not guarantee the stability of instantons  @xcite .",

    "was stated  @xcite by a close correlation  maximum by maximum of the modulus of the topological density  between the `` instanton size '' , determined by the curvature of @xmath38 in the maximum position @xmath39 of the cluster , and the value of the density @xmath40 .",
    "the local lattice operator  @xcite to represent the topological density for the stout - link smeared configurations is based on a highly improved field - strength tensor , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and with @xmath43 being a symmetrized `` clover sum '' of @xmath44 wilson loops around the site @xmath45 .",
    "a 3-loop improved field strength tensor can be achieved chosing @xmath46 , such that @xmath47 .",
    "the topological charge density is then represented in the form @xmath48",
    "the two - point correlators for stout - link smearing and overlap filtering are matched using a minimization of the sum of the absolute difference between the correlators .",
    "that is , we compute @xmath49 as a function of the number of smearing sweeps , @xmath50 , for fixed @xmath0 .    the topological charge of each overlap filtered configuration is integer valued because they satisfy the atiyah - singer index theorem  ( [ eq : atiyah - singer ] ) .",
    "for stout - link smearing it can take up to @xmath51 sweeps of smearing to achieve an integer charge on these @xmath4 lattices . in order to compare overlap filtering and stout - link smearing for @xmath52 in a fair way a non - perturbative normalization is applied .",
    "given that we know the topological charge @xmath53 from the overlap configurations , we calculate , for each number of smearing sweeps @xmath50 , a normalization factor @xmath54 via @xmath55 and @xmath56 is then normalized through @xmath57 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath58 .",
    "we also experimented with an alternate normalization where we matched the absolute values of the topological charge density , however this proved less fruitful .",

    ".table of @xmath54 values for the initial five configurations .",
    "the normalization procedure is only valid for @xmath59 and works best for large @xmath60 .",
    "the fluctuating values for the configuration with @xmath61 occuring at @xmath62 are due to @xmath63 being approximately @xmath64 at this point . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that the zero modes typically are simultaneously carried by a moderate number of centers below the peak density , before they start percolating throughout the whole lattice at an even lower level of the scalar density .",
    "here we additionally learn that all theses centers are marked by lumps of topological charge of appropriate sign , however not necessarily all lumps are covered .    for these same three configurations",
    "we now consider the distribution of the lowest non - zero modes . starting with the first @xmath61 configuration , we present the scalar and pseudoscalar densities of the first non - zero mode in fig .  [",
    "fig : zm.0123-rho-1 ] .",
    "+   +     one sees that the pseudoscalar density , according to its local chirality , highlights certain parts of the topological lumps with appropriate sign of charge , and leaves others ( for other low - lying modes ) .",

    "apart from the remaining @xmath60 zero modes , the almost - zero modes are expected to bridge at least one pair of instanton and anti - instanton with the scalar density peaking on top of the topological charge lumps and the pseudoscalar density peaking with the appropriate sign there .",

    "these two views of getting the infrared topological structure of the gauge field correspond to each other . a similar result , however for ape smearing and a different improved dirac operator , has been found in ref .  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "this has been confirmed for two other specific realizations of both methods , using the massless overlap dirac operator  @xcite on one hand and stout - link smearing with respect to an over - improved symanzik type action  @xcite on the other .",
    "these two methods have their respective advantages compared to the approximate solution  @xcite of the ginsparg - wilson relation and ape smearing  @xcite .    in this paper , the comparison has been made more complete and detailed , based first on the density - density two - point function and second on a point - by - point matching of the respective topological densities .",
    "the correspondence between the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath0 of the overlap analysis and the number of smearing steps justifies the use of over - improved stout - link smearing , which is computationally less demanding , in the analysis of topological vacuum structure .",
    "this is of particular interest when investigating the differences between the vacuum structure of quenched and non - quenched qcd  @xcite .",
    "what we did not yet do in the present paper is the natural next step of formulating a description of the outstanding clusters of topological charge ( at each level of ultraviolet smoothing ) in terms of an filtered field strength , a possibility also offered by the overlap analysis  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one should study the degree of ( anti)selfduality of the gauge field and the percolation properties of the corresponding ( anti)selfdual domains  @xcite .",
