    "recent advances in fabrication and material growth technologies have made possible the production of devices whose dimensions are order of a few nanometers .",
    "the thermoelectric power , thermal and electrical conductivities of these mesoscopic scale materials are of interest for thermoelectric device applications@xcite , such as heat pumps@xcite and power generators . the performance of a thermoelectric device is usually quantified by a dimensionless number called as figure of merit , @xmath0 , which measures the efficiency of thermoelectric energy conversion .",
    "higher values of @xmath0 correspond to higher thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency so that , for example , if @xmath0 tends to infinity , the efficiency approaches to that of an ideal carnot engine .",
    "recent work on superlattice semiconducting devices demonstrated @xmath1 at room temperature@xcite and @xmath2 at high temperatures@xcite , breaking the long - standing limit of @xmath3 for most of best known thermoelectric materials .    in 1d nanoscale systems ,",
    "the increase of @xmath0 might be further enhanced by the quantum confining of electrons and phonons in low dimensions@xcite . in the recent experimental study , for instance",
    ", @xmath0 could be increased by embedding nanoparticles in a crystalline semiconductors@xcite .",
    "high values of @xmath0 can also be obtained for one - dimensional structures displaying resonant transmission . in this case , the transmission probabilities are very sensitive to the electron energies leading to large values of the thermopower and hence of the figure of merit . in this contribution ,",
    "relationships between different thermoelectric coefficients are calculated , and probably the first , @xmath0 values of a resonant tunnelling device is computed and its dependence on device parameters is investigated .",
    "we are expecting that our calculations will be a good guide to researchers studying on thermoelectric devices .",
    "in here a one - dimensional mesoscopic device is considered .",
    "it is assumed that there is only one transverse mode that is occupied by the electrons .",
    "the thermoelectric currents in such a device under linear regime can be expressed in terms of the energy dependent transmission probability @xmath4 of the electrons@xcite .",
    "the electric current , @xmath5 , and the heat current , @xmath6 , under a potential difference @xmath7 and a temperature difference @xmath8 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are @xmath11 @xmath12 is the chemical potential and @xmath13 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .    frequently measured transport coefficients , the electrical conductance @xmath14 , the thermal conductance @xmath15 , the seebeck coefficient @xmath16 , and the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath17    it can be seen that , to obtain large values of @xmath0 , the factor @xmath18 , which also appears in the seebeck coefficient , has to be large .",
    "equation  ( [ gn ] ) implies that at low temperatures , @xmath18 is basically proportional to the first derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , large values of @xmath18 can be achieved when @xmath4 is strongly energy dependent , and the fastest change in it occurs around the fermi level . in this contribution",
    "we investigate a resonant tunnelling device where the transmission probability is assumed to have a lorentzian form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the resonance energy and @xmath21 is the half width .",
    "the factor @xmath18 and the seebeck coefficient @xmath16 changes sign when the fermi energy crosses the resonance energy @xmath20 .",
    "however , when @xmath12 differs from @xmath20 by an energy of the order of @xmath21 , both of these quantities attain large values and this is the region where we should look for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is assumed that the fermi level is very large compared to the temperature so that the lower limit of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gn ] ) is extended to minus infinity .",
    "it can be seen that the values of @xmath0 depend on two dimensionless parameters .",
    "one of them , @xmath22 , indicates the distance of the fermi level from the resonance energy in units of the half width @xmath21 , and the other , @xmath23 gives the temperature compared to the resonance width .",

    "the seebeck coefficient is zero at @xmath26 and has different signs at different sides of this point . since @xmath0 is an even function of @xmath25 , only the positive values of @xmath25",

    "the best place of the fermi level is approximately one resonance width above or below of the resonance energy ( @xmath31 ) , but the maximum attainable figure of merit value is very low . for high temperatures however , both of these parameters have a linear dependence on temperature which are approximately given as @xmath32 it can be seen that , in each case the optimum value of the figure of merit is obtained when @xmath33 , i.e. , the fermi level should be more than one half - width away from the resonance energy . if the lorentzian form of the resonance in eq .",

    "when the fermi level is almost coincident with the resonance energy ( @xmath36 ) , the temperature at which maximum attained is around @xmath37 .",
    "however , in this region , @xmath0 values are low . in the opposite case ,",
    "for @xmath38 , the optimum temperature and the best value of @xmath0 appear to be linear in @xmath25 with the following numerical relationships @xmath39 the approximate relation @xmath40 seems to hold over the whole range investigated in this study .",
    "it is seen that for one - dimensional systems displaying resonant transmission , it is possible to obtain large values of the figure of merit @xmath0 by fine - tuning the device parameters , the resonance width and the place of the resonance energy relative to the fermi level .",
    "the optimum working conditions for the largest values of @xmath0 appears to be far away from the resonance : fermi level is several @xmath21 away from the resonance energy @xmath20 and @xmath41 is several times @xmath21 .",
    "it can be argued that , under such extreme cases , the validity of lorentzian form in eq .",
    "( [ t_of_e ] ) is questionable and some of the results obtained in here can be changed .",
    "however , the crucial feature leading to these results is the strong energy dependence of the transmission probability .",
    "specifically , the transmission probability should continue decreasing at the fermi level and not reach to a minimum .",
    "for this reason , similar results can be expected for realistic devices .",
    "numerical computations for a double barrier system displaying resonances indicate that when the half width @xmath21 is much smaller than the distance between the resonances , results obtained are roughly in agreement with the ones in here . for this reason lorentzian form",
    "can be used as a fairly good guide for designing devices .",
    "an important problem , connected with being far away from the resonance , is the smallness of the electrical and thermal conductances .",
    "for this reason , efficient devices can only work with very small power .",
    "moreover , precautions should be taken to make the phonon contribution to the heat conductance to be very small as this will always decrease the @xmath0 value .",
    "the figure of merit has been computed for a system whose transmission probability displays a lorentzian peak . by adjusting the resonance width to be small and carefully placing the fermi level for the working temperatures of interest , significantly high values of @xmath0 can be obtained .",
    "approximate numerical relationships , which can be a guide for designing thermoelectric devices , for the optimum values of the parameters are also given ."
