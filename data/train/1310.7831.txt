    "accretion of matter onto black holes is an extensively studied topic and the most likely scenario to explain the high energy output from active galactic nuclei and quasars .",
    "the seminal paper by bondi @xcite is devoted to formulating the theory of stationary , spherically symmetric and transonic accretion of adiabatic fluids onto astrophysical objects .",
    "indeed bondi @xcite solved the problem of a polytropic gas accreting onto a central object under the influence of gravity , which generalizes the earlier results of bondi and hoyle @xcite and hoyle and lyttleton @xcite who investigated pressure - free gas being dragged onto a massive central object .",
    "there has been some confusion in distinguishing these cases in the literature but the latter case is usually referred to as lyttleton - hoyle accretion whilst the former is termed bondi accretion @xcite .",
    "the key distinction between the two cases is that the gas and the accretor are in the same inertial rest - frame in bondi accretion whilst in lyttleton - hoyle accretion the gas has a finite velocity at infinity @xcite .",
    "both of these cases are formulated in the context of newtonian gravity .",
    "there exists a large body of literature devoted to theoretical and observational studies of accretion processes .",
    "detailed treatments can be found in any of the standard texts @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .    in the framework of general relativity ,",
    "the steady - state spherically symmetric flow of a test gas onto a schwarzschild black hole was investigated by michel @xcite . following michel s relativistic generalization of bondi s treatment ,",
    "begelman @xcite discussed some aspects of the critical points of the accretion problem .",
    "spherical accretion and winds in general relativity have also been considered using equations of state other than the polytropic one .",
    "other comprehensive treatments include the calculation of the luminosity and frequency spectrum @xcite , the influence of an interstellar magnetic field on the accretion of ionized gases @xcite , and accreting processes onto a rotating black hole @xcite .",
    "various radiative processes have been incorporated by blumenthal and mathews @xcite , and brinkmann @xcite . recently",
    "malec @xcite provided the solution for general relativistic spherical accretion with and without back - reaction and showed that relativistic effects enhance mass accretion when back - reaction is neglected .",
    "accretion onto a charged black hole was considered in @xcite and more fully investigated in @xcite .",
    "spherical winds and shock transitions were studied in @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of spherically symmetric accretion of different types of fluids onto black holes were further undertaken in a number of works .",
    "string theory is widely believed to be the most promising candidate for a unified description of everything ; it predicts the existence of higher dimensions for its consistency .",
    "it is important to note that gravity in higher dimensions is very different from its four dimensional counterpart .",
    "for example , black holes with a fixed mass may have arbitrarily large angular momentum @xcite .",
    "there is a growing realization that the physics of higher dimensional black holes can be markedly different , and much richer than in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the higher dimensional theories are applied in various unsolved problems in astrophysics and cosmology to gain new insights into them . on the other hand ,",
    "the accretion process is a powerful way of understanding the physical nature of the central celestial condensed objects ; the analysis of signatures of the accretion disk could provide another possible way to detect the influence of higher dimensions .",
    "an interesting study of accretion in higher dimensions was initiated by giddings and mangano , @xcite , who studied higher dimensional accretion onto tev black holes in the newtonian limit .",
    "they argued that since the bondi radius is typically much larger than the event horizon radius one can safely describe the gravitational field of the accreting black hole by a newtonian potential . in this paper",
    "we look at steady , spherical accretion of a polytropic gas onto a point mass in @xmath2-dimensional general relativity .",
    "the event horizon radius is of the order @xmath3 whilst the bondi radius scales like @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fluid sound speed .",
    "if the sound speed approaches the speed of light i.e. @xmath6 then the bondi radius approaches the event horizon and one can no longer disregard the effects of spacetime curvature .",
    "such a situation could arise if , for example , the accreting fluid obeyed a stiff equation of state .",
    "higher dimensional black holes arise in extensions to the standard model of particle physics like @xmath1-theory .",
    "we consider @xmath2-dimensional general relativity rather than @xmath2-dimensional newtonian gravity as a low energy limit of semi - classical physics .",
    "the accretion of phantom matter onto @xmath7-dimensional charged black holes was investigated by sharif and abbas @xcite .",
    "as was the case in phantom accretion onto @xmath8-dimensional schwarzschild @xcite and reissner - nordstrom black holes @xcite , the black hole mass decreases .",
    "the accretion of phantom energy onto einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet black holes was studied in @xcite .",
    "they showed that the evolution of the black hole mass was independent of its mass and depends only on the energy density and pressure of the phantom energy .",
    "this result is similar to that arising in the accretion of phantom matter onto a 2 + 1 dimensional banados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole @xcite .",
    "jamil and hussain @xcite conjecture that the rate of change of mass of a black hole due to phantom energy accretion depends on the mass of a black hole in 4 dimensions only .",
    "we believe that this mass independence is not a generic feature of higher dimensional accretion and arises because of the pathological nature of phantom matter which violates the dominant energy condition .",
    "we consequently focus our attention on more conventional fluids . in this paper",
    "we formulate and solve the problem of a polytropic gas accreting onto a schwarzschild black hole in arbitrary dimensions . the gravitational model used",
    "is @xmath2-dimensional general relativity .",
    "we determine analytically the critical radius , critical fluid velocity and sound speed , and subsequently the mass accretion rate .",
    "we then obtain expressions for the asymptopic behaviour of the fluid density and temperature near the event horizon .",
    "we use the following values for physical constants and the accreting system s parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "in this model , we assume a higher dimensional spherically symmetric metric , and steady state flow onto a nonrotating black hole of mass @xmath1 at rest in the interstellar medium . a black hole surrounded by the stellar plasma",
    "is expected to capture matter within a certain distance , which may result in a flow of plasma towards the black hole .",
    "it may be recalled that the non - relativistic model was discussed by bondi @xcite and the standard 4-dimensional general relativistic version was developed by michel @xcite .",
    "the known analytic relativistic accretion solution onto the schwarzschild black hole by michel @xcite is extended to arbitary dimensions . to do this",
    ", we assume that the black hole is represented by the @xmath2-dimensional generalization of schwarzschild black hole described by the line element @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the spacetime dimension and @xmath18 is related to the mass of the black hole via @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the area of a unit @xmath21-dimensional sphere @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the line element on the sphere , viz . @xmath24",
    "we use comoving coordinates @xmath25 and units where @xmath26 . at particular points we reintroduce @xmath27 and @xmath28 to ease comparison with shapiro and teukolsky @xcite .",
    "the above metric ( [ metrichd ] ) provides a vacuum solution in the @xmath29-dimensional einstein theory , describing static , asymptotically flat higher dimensional black holes . as seen easily , the black hole horizon exists at @xmath30 .",
    "the standard schwarzschild solution can be recovered by setting @xmath31    next , we probe how the extra dimensions affect the bondi accretion rate , the asymptotic compression ratio , and the temperature profiles .",
    "we consider the steady - state radial inflow of gas onto a central mass @xmath1 .",
    "the gas is approximated as a perfect fluid described by the energy momentum tensor @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fluid proper energy density and pressure respectively , and @xmath35 is the fluid @xmath2-velocity , which obeys the normalization condition @xmath36 we also define the proper baryon number density @xmath37 , and the baryon number flux @xmath38 .",
    "all these quantities are measured in the local inertial rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the spacetime curvature is dominated by the compact object and we ignore the self - gravity of the fluid . if no particles are created or destroyed then particle number is conserved and @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum is governed by @xmath42 we define the radial component of the @xmath2-velocity , @xmath43 . since @xmath44 and the velocity components vanish for @xmath45 we have @xmath46 equation ( [ masscon ] ) for , our @xmath2-dimensional schwarzschild case , can be written as @xmath47 our assumption of spherical symmetry and steady - state flow makes ( [ momentum ] ) comparatively easier to tackle . the @xmath48 component of ( [ momentum ] ) is @xmath49 the @xmath50 component can be simplified to @xmath51 these expressions generalise , to arbitrary dimensions @xmath2 , those obtained by michel @xcite for spherical accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole and we recover them in the 4-dimensional limit : @xmath52    .[gamma1p1 ] critical radius @xmath53 , accretion parameter @xmath54 and accretion rate @xmath0 for @xmath55 .",
    "values are expressed in geometrized units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in recent years , black hole solutions in more than four spacetime dimensions have been the subject of intensive research , motivated by ideas in brane - world cosmology , string theory and gauge / gravity duality .",
    "several interesting and surprising results have been found @xcite . in dimensions",
    "higher than four , the uniqueness theorems do not hold due to the fact that there are more degrees of freedom .",
    "the discovery of black - ring solutions in five dimensions shows that non - trivial topologies are allowed in higher dimensions @xcite . to determine the fate of black holes in higher dimensional scenarios we considered spherically symmetric , steady state , adiabatic accretion onto a higher dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we determined the general analytic expressions for the critical radius and mass accretion rate , for polytropic matter accreting onto a @xmath2-dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we also found explict expressions for the gas compression and temperature profile both below the critical radius and at the event horizon .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath0 is clearly dependent on the mass and dimensionality of the black hole .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the result of bondi @xcite which showed that @xmath56 .",
    "our result also generalises the study of giddings and mangano @xcite which obtained the mass - dependent accretion rate of matter accreting via the newtonian gravity potential of a @xmath2-dimensional tev black hole .",
    "we have not considered compactification of higher dimensions and leave this as a future project .",
    "upper bounds for higher dimensions have been established in the literature and their effects on black hole accretion , as well as other physical processes , will be restricted to the compactification scale . beyond this length scale",
    "we expect conventional @xmath8-dimensional physics to dominate .",
    "a number of extensions to our study of higher dimensional accretion are possible .",
    "one can attempt to work out the effect of extra dimensions on the luminosity , frequency spectrum and energy conversion efficiency of the the accretion flow .",
    "more exotic matter , like scalar fields , could be investigated .",
    "unlike general relativity , lovelock gravity and its special case , einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity , have been demonstrated to be low energy limits of particular string theories .",
    "it may be feasible to study the effects of accretion on to higher dimensional black holes described by those gravity theories .",
