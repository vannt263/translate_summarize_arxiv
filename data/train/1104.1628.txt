    "the observational evidence for an acceleration of the expansion of the universe is now overwhelming , although the precise cause of this phenomenon is still unknown ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) . in this concern , and besides the need for more accurate estimates of cosmological parameters , the current state of affairs also brings to light some other important aspects regarding the physics of the mechanism behind cosmic acceleration .",
    "certainly , one of these aspects concerns the thermodynamical behavior of a dark energy - dominated universe , and questions such as `` what is the thermodynamic behavior of the dark energy in an expanding universe ? '' or , more precisely , `` what is its temperature evolution law ? '' must be answered in the context of this new conceptual set up .",
    "another interesting aspect in this discussion is whether thermodynamics in the accelerating universe can place constraints on the time evolution of the dark energy and can also reveal some physical properties of this energy component .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , to derive physical constraints on the dark energy from the second law of thermodynamics and to deduce the temperature evolution law for a dark component with a general equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath6 ; second , to perform a joint statistical analysis involving current observational data together with the thermodynamic bounds on @xmath6 . to do that , we assume the following generalized formula for the time evolution of @xmath6  @xcite @xmath7 which recovers some well - known eos parameterizations in the following limits : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for the dark energy pressure and energy density , respectively ( see also @xcite for other eos parameterizations ) .",
    "the analyses are performed using one the most recent type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations , the nearby + sdss + essence + snls + hubble space telescope ( hst ) set of 288 sne ia discussed in ref .",

    "we consider two sub - samples of this latter compilation that use salt2  @xcite and mlcs2k2  @xcite sn ia light - curve fitting method . along with the sne",
    "ia data , and to help break the degeneracy between the dark energy parameters we also use the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak at @xmath11  @xcite and the current estimate of the cmb shift parameter @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we work in units where c = 1 . throughout this paper a subscript 0 stands for present - day quantities and a dot denotes time derivative .",
    "let us first consider a homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat cosmologies described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) flat line element , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the cosmological scalar factor .",
    "the matter content is assumed to be composed of baryons , cold dark matter and a dark energy component .",

    "a possible physical explanation for this behavior is that thermodynamic work is being done on the system ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of ref .",

    "] by assuming arbitrary values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 k. from this analysis , it is clear that an important point for the thermodynamic fate of the universe is to know how long the dark energy temperature will take to become the dominant temperature of the universe .",
    "a basic difficulty in estimating such a time interval , however , is that the present - day dark energy temperature has not been measured , being completely unknown .    0.1 in    by considering that the chemical potential for this @xmath6-fluid is null ( as occurs for @xmath44 )",

    "note also that the vacuum entropy is zero ( @xmath36 ) whereas for phantom dark energy ( @xmath48 ) , which violates all the energy conditions  @xcite , the entropy assumes negative values being , therefore , meaningless ( for a discussion on the behavior of a phanton fluid with nonzero chemical potential , see  @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an alternative explanation in which the temperature of the phantom component takes negative values and @xcite for other thermodynamic analyses of dark energy ) .",

    "we plot contours of @xmath70 in the parametric space @xmath4 - @xmath5 for p2 and p3 , respectively .",
    "the light gray region displayed in the plots stands for the physical constraint ( [ c1 ] ) . since this inequality is a function of time , the region is plotted by assuring its validity from @xmath71 up to today at @xmath55 .",
