    "realization of this fact had its origin over forty years ago when it was shown @xcite that the many - body problem of hard - sphere bosons in one dimension can be mapped exactly onto that of an ideal fermi gas , so that many properties of such bose systems are fermi - like .",
    "it is now known that this `` fermi - bose duality '' is a very general property of identical particles in 1d , not restricted to the hard - sphere model , and relating strongly interacting bosons to weakly - interacting fermions and vice versa . in recent years",

    "an understanding of their properties is important for atom interferometry @xcite and integrated atom optics @xcite , which are potentially important for development of ultrasensitive detectors of accelerations and gravitational anomalies .    when an ultracold atomic vapor is placed into an atom waveguide with sufficiently tight transverse confinement , its two - body scattering properties are strongly modified and short - range correlations are greatly enhanced .",
    "this occurs in a regime of low temperatures and densities where both the chemical potential @xmath0 and the thermal energy @xmath1 are less than the transverse oscillator level spacing @xmath2 , so transverse oscillator modes are frozen and the dynamics is described by a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonian with zero - range interactions @xcite .",

    "however , both even and odd - wave interactions between up and down - spin particles are present because the states @xmath455 are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric under exchanges @xmath463 between up and down - spin atoms .",

    "phase the ground state energy depends only on @xmath438 , hence on @xmath449 but not on @xmath448 , a result which we will show holds also for the _ exact _",
    "@xmath11-atom ground state .",
    "the gp approximation is valid when both @xmath494 and @xmath495 are small enough , more precisely when both @xmath496 and @xmath497 . since the product @xmath498 can be made to assume any desired value without violating these inequalities , it is reasonable to suppose that the phase boundary @xmath490 holds for the _ exact _ ground state .",
    "we now show that this is true . to see this , note first that since @xmath466 is symmetric in @xmath456 and in @xmath457 , it follows that when acting on @xmath466 , @xmath499 is equivalent to @xmath500 defined in connection with eq .",
    "( [ even - interaction ] ) with @xmath501 , and similarly @xmath502 is equivalent to @xmath503 .",
    "furthermore , one may formally add interactions @xmath464 and @xmath465 since these vanish on @xmath466 because of its symmetry in @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "thus in ( [ 2-component - bose ] ) we may replace @xmath499 by @xmath504 $ ] and @xmath502 by @xmath505 $ ] without changing its action on @xmath466 .",
    "after this has been done , we note that when @xmath506 , the resultant hamiltonian reduces to that of a _ one_-component bose gas with both even and odd - wave interactions , with ground state energy @xmath507 which is independent of @xmath73 , hence independent of @xmath417 .",
    "hence , on the line @xmath490 ground states of all values of @xmath417 from @xmath508 to @xmath419 are degenerate , and it is easy to show that this remains true if spin - independent longitudinal trap potentials are added to @xmath509 . to complete the proof we need to convert this into a statement about the total spin @xmath510 of the ground state , not merely its value of @xmath417 . to do this , first map back to the two - component fermi gas states @xmath453 .",
    "they are not in general eigenstates of @xmath510 , but they can be converted into such eigenstates @xmath155 , with the same eigenvalues of both energy and @xmath417 , by antisymmetrizing with respect to all combined space - spin exchanges @xmath511 after renaming the variables as follows : @xmath512 and @xmath513 . in this standard representation",
    "the hamiltonian , total spin , and its z - component are mutually commuting , so nondegerate energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of @xmath514 and @xmath515 , and degenerate ones can be chosen to be such simultaneous eigenstates .",
    "let @xmath516 be the lowest such state for given values of @xmath517 and @xmath518 .",
    "we have shown that if @xmath488 then such a ground state has @xmath486 , if @xmath489 it has @xmath519 , and if @xmath490 it can have any value of @xmath417 from @xmath508 to @xmath520 .",
    "if @xmath489 this state also has @xmath492 since @xmath519 implies @xmath492 . if @xmath488 then the ground state also has @xmath414",
    "because if it had @xmath521 than there would exist states with @xmath522 of the same energy , contradicting the monotonic dependence of energy on @xmath523 demonstrated in ( [ gp - energy ] ) , which we assume to hold also for the _ exact _ ground state .",
    "it follows that the hyperbola @xmath490 is the boundary between a ground state @xmath414 phase ( @xmath488 ) and a @xmath492 phase ( @xmath489 ) .",
    "it follows from the above that the dependence of the ground - state energy on total spin @xmath510 is more complicated than envisioned in either @xcite or @xcite : it is indeed true that if @xmath518 is _ exactly _ zero , then the ground state has @xmath414 as assumed in @xcite , but if @xmath524 then by approaching the confinement - induced resonance ( cir ) of @xmath448 implied by eq .",

    "( [ fermi - renorm ] ) a phase transition in the opposite direction ( @xmath415 to @xmath414 ) would in principle occur if @xmath526 , but in practice there is no way of making @xmath448 that small . in the region @xmath489 where @xmath415 the exact ground state is totally spatially antisymmetric and hence spin - aligned , so its energy is independent of @xmath448 and given by the results in @xcite and sec .",

    "@xcite in the longitudinally trapped case .",
    "no analytical or numerical results are yet known for the ground - state energy in the region @xmath488 if @xmath528 , but it should be investigated by numerical calculations .",
    "these will be more complicated than the previous ones @xcite due to the presence of both even and odd - wave interactions between up and down - spin atoms .",
    "however , if the ground state is real and nodeless @xcite they should be feasible , perhaps by using an interaction potential consisting of a narrow and deep well to represent the odd - wave interaction ( see sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : spin - aligned ] ) together with a somewhat broader `` soft rod '' potential to represent the even - wave interaction .",
    "our proof of the exact ground - state phase boundary @xmath490 is a `` physicist s proof '' and we make no claim of mathematical rigor . in the first place , as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : p - wave ] , a rigorous derivation of the zero - range , 1d limit of the odd - wave interaction between fermions in tight waveguides does not exist at present , although we believe that eq .",
    "( [ fermi - renorm ] ) is a correct zero - range , low - energy consequence of the k - matrix treatment of granger and blume @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath420 our proof of the phase boundary is not completely rigorous since we had to assume that the ground state energy is a single - valued function of @xmath417 both for @xmath488 and for @xmath489 .",
    "we feel that this is justified since we proved it to be true in the gp approximation and showed that the criteria for validity of the gp approximation can be satisfied on the phase boundary @xmath490 .",

    "<S> derivation of effective zero - range one - dimensional ( 1d ) interactions between atoms in tight waveguides is reviewed , as is the fermi - bose mapping method for determination of exact and strongly - correlated many - body ground states of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atomic vapors in such waveguides , including spin degrees of freedom . </S>",
