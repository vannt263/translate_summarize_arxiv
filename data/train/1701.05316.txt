    "in fluid dynamical simulations in astrophysics , large deformations are common and surface tracking is sometimes necessary .",
    "mesh - free methods , in which particles move following the motion of fluid , are very useful for such simulations . in particular , smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; @xcite , @xcite ) has been widely used in astrophysics and also in computer - aided engineering .",
    "sph is one of lagrangian methods . in sph",
    ", we assume that the fluid equation can be expressed by interactions between fluid particles .",
    "therefore , sph is not only suitable for simulation of large deformations , but also can satisfy the conservation laws .",
    "recently , however , it has become known that sph has several difficulties .",
    "for example , it can not handle contact discontinuities ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) or fluid surfaces . in our opinion",
    ", the standard formation of sph has the following three problems , 1 ) the density distribution must be differentiable ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , sph can not handle the contact discontinuity properly .",
    "2 ) since the approximation of quantities in sph is of zeroth order in space , sph does not have the consistency to the original partial differential equation ( e.g. @xcite ) . according to the lax equivalence theorem ( @xcite ) ,",
    "a method , which does not have the consistency , does not converge to the original partial differential equation in the limit of the infinite resolution .",
    "3 ) there is no mathematically sound way to specify boundary conditions in sph , except for the mirror boundary condition .",
    "traditionally , fixed particles have been used to express reflecting boundaries such as walls and bottom of a well .",
    "they are necessary because sph can not express a sharp cutoff in the density distribution .",
    "however , there is no way to let these fixed particles change their physical quantities correctly .",
    "thus , smoothed estimate of physical quantities of particles near the boundary contains large errors .    to solve problem one ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed modified formulation of sph in which the differentiability of the density is not required .",
    "their methods can handle the density discontinuity better than standard sph ( hereafter ssph ) does .    in previous studies , high - order scheme",
    "have been proposed as the solution to problem two .",
    "@xcite formulated moving least squares particles hydrodynamics ( mlsph ) based on the moving least square ( mls ) technique . in reproducing kernel particle method ( rkpm ; @xcite ) , the formulation is not mls , but is similar .",
    "these methods were applied to inviscid fluid dynamics simulations .",
    "however , they have not been applied to large deformations .",
    "corrective sph method ( cspm ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is based on the taylor expansion and method of weighted residuals ( mwr ) .",
    "they calculated burgers equation , conduction of heat , linear elastodynamics and others with cphm .",
    "in addition , @xcite modified this scheme and they called it modified sph ( msph ) .",
    "msph was applied to the elastic wave and the diffusion equation . for non - compressible fluid",
    ", @xcite introduced high - order formulation into moving particle semi - implicit method ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , finite particle method ( fpm ; @xcite ) was developed using mwr to handle viscous fluid .",
    "they calculated dam break test with fpm .",
    "corrected sph ( csph ) in @xcite successfully handled the dam break test of inviscid fluid by re - fitting the density frequently .",
    "the frequent re - fitting generates numerical viscosity , and particles move to reduce the number - density deviation .",
    "thus , large viscosity occurs in their simulation . in other word , if fluid particles do not move following fluid line to prevent the number - density deviation , large numerical viscosity is induced .",
    "there seems to be no high - order scheme without large numerical viscosity for inviscid fluid tested with the calculation of large deformations .",
    "@xcite argued that it is difficult to handle large deformations with a high - order scheme .",
    "figure [ fig : khi_noise ] shows the result of a simulation of the kelvin - helmholtz instability performed using the high - order mesh - free method presented in section [ sec : form_norm ] .",
    "the simulation time is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the time scale of the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "we can see large deviations of the number - density of particles .",
    "these deviations are the result of the fact that each particle move following the fluid motion at its location accurately .",
    "small - scale vortex can easily generate highly disordered distribution of particles .",
    "this problem is mathematically same as the generation of large density fluctuation in cold keplerian disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .    .",
    "the right panel is the enlarge image of low - density region of the left.,width=453 ]    from the above , it is necessary to rearrange particles , when the large number - density deviation occurs .    one potential problem of high - order method is that they do not completely satisfy the conservation law because particles do not have extensive variables ( @xcite , @xcite ) . to construct a high - order mesh - free method which satisfies the conservation laws",
    ", we must define fluid particles which have extensive variables .",
    "hence , each particle must also have its volume .",
    "this volume has to be represented by some physical shape of the particle .",
    "if the mass of a particle is constant , its shape of the particle has to change following the fluid deformation .",
    "consider an initially spherical particle in velocity field with a uniform shear .",
    "it will become elongated very soon , and thus numerical scheme would break down . therefore , no high - order method can satisfy the conservation law completely",
    ". however , we found that the error of the conservation law is very small for high - order methods .",
    "concerning problem three , we can apply boundary conditions in mathematically meaningful and well - defined way because we approximate the partial differential equation using fitting polynomial for intensive variables in high - order mesh - free method .",
    "we call our method consistent particle hydrodynamics in strong form ( cphsf ) .",
    "we performed several numerical tests , and results were excellent .    in the rest of this paper , we present cphsf ( section [ sec : form ] ) , and report the results of numerical tests ( section [ sec : test ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarize our study ( section [ sec : sumanddis ] ) .",
    "as described in introduction , many different high - order approximation methods have been proposed in previous studies . in the following , we call these approximation methods `` shape functions '' , since they can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the approximation of a spacial partial derivative of function @xmath4 with respect to variables @xmath5 at position @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the value of function @xmath4 at the location of particle @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the `` shape function '' of particle @xmath8 .",
    "these shape function can be classified by whether or not they are defined as the minimum of the l2 norm of the residual of the fitting .",
    "we call shape functions based on the minimization of l2 norm type 1 and others type 2 .      in this section",
    ", we consider an approximation of function @xmath4 , @xmath11 , which minimizes @xmath12 ^ 2 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume @xmath13 is of @xmath14 class , i.e. @xmath13 is @xmath15-times differentiable . here , @xmath16 is the weight of particle @xmath8 for approximation at particle @xmath17 .    to derive shape functions in the way similar to those in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we define @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the approximations of @xmath20 and have the error @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the dimension of the space .",
    "therefore , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : taylor , normal ] ) matches the taylor expansion around @xmath23 of @xmath24 up to for ( @xmath25)-th order for @xmath26-th order spatial derivatives .",
    "if we do not need the interpolation formula for @xmath27 , it is possible to set @xmath28 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this paper , we need the interpolation formula for @xmath27 in section [ sec : form_ref ] .",
    "therefore , we do not use this form .",
    "the optimal @xmath29 for which @xmath30 takes the extreme , is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a regular matrix .",
    "note that if @xmath32 becomes a rank deficient , it means that the set of @xmath7 does not have enough information to derive a unique @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in such a case , we widen the non - zero region of @xmath16 to increase the number of particles in the shape function .    in this paper , we set @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a kernel function that depends on @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath36 is a kernel length that denotes the width of the kernel function . in sph , it is usually given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant coefficient .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath39 are the mass and the mass - density .    from the above ,",

    "however , we can get only zeroth order differential shape function , and thus it takes calculation cost to differentiate shape function which consists of a matrix and others .",
    "therefore , we use equation ( [ eq : my , sf1 ] ) as a differential shape function .    in this paper",

    "we derived the shape functions using mls in section [ sec : form_norm ] .",

    "many forms of the artificial viscosity have been proposed for sph to capture shocks ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . however , most of them cause unwanted shear viscosity ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "to reduce unwanted shear viscosity , @xcite and @xcite introduced shear switches that reduce viscosity when the shear exists .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite proposed the use of riemann solvers in order not to use the artificial viscosity . @xcite introduced a form of the artificial viscosity different from that of @xcite .",
    "this artificial viscosity ( hereafter nrav ) was derived by adding the bulk viscosity to the artificial viscosity formulated by @xcite .",
    "this viscosity is applied only when @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the velocity .",
    "@xcite compared many different forms of artificial viscosities , including the usual @xcite type , and nr type , both with and without different forms of shear switches and time - dependent switches .",
    "they found the nr type viscosity is the best , when the estimate of @xmath70 is of high order .",
    "when a low - order estimate is used , it causes unwanted shear viscosity .",
    "these proposed forms of the artificial viscosity can handle fluid with the velocity shear better than the standard artificial viscosity of sph can .",
    "the standard sph artificial viscosity is defined for pairs of particles , and thus there is no easy way to apply it to high - order schemes in which particles do not have extensive quantities .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that even for sph schemes , nrav is better than the standard sph artificial viscosity . therefore , we adopted nrav .",
    "initially , we used the usual form of nrav extended to multi - dimensional space @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant coefficient and @xmath73 is the internal energy .",
    "the function @xmath74 is the theta function .",
    "we , however , found that this form leads to numerical instability .",
    "the reason why the instability takes place is that the pressure - like quantity in nrav in equations ( [ eq : avmom , mdim , org ] ) and ( [ eq : aveng , mdim , org ] ) is isotropic .",
    "therefore , these `` pressure '' can and does operate to directions perpendicular to the direction of compression , resulting in the increase of the kinetic energy . therefore , we extend the nrav to multi - dimensions so that the artificial viscosity operates only in the direction of the maximum compression .",
    "note that we assume that the number of shock waves at one position is only one .",
    "let @xmath75 the coordinate of the direction of a shock wave .",
    "@xcite introduced the following the artificial viscosity to equations of moment and energy .",
    "@xmath76 to extend this artificial viscosity to multi - dimensions , first , we determine the direction of @xmath75 axis along which the fluid is maximally compressed .",
    "second , the artificial viscosity for this @xmath75-direction is calculated . finally , we transform the calculated the artificial viscosity into the original system of coordinates .",
    "the strain rate tensor is given by @xmath77 using eigenvalues @xmath78 and eigenvectors @xmath79 , @xmath80 is diagonalized as @xmath81 we assume eigenvalues are ordered , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , if @xmath83 , we apply the artificial viscosity in the direction of @xmath84 . here , the transformed coordinate is given by @xmath85 first , we derive the artificial viscosity in the equation of motion . in the transformed coordinate ,",
    "the artificial viscosity term is given by @xmath86 therefore , in the original coordinate , the artificial viscosity term in the equation of motion is @xmath87 here , by using the quantities in the original coordinate , @xmath88 can be expressed by @xmath89 from the above , the artificial viscosity term in the equation of motion in the original coordinate is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is @xmath92 . here , @xmath93 denotes the first element of @xmath94 .",
    "next , we derive the artificial viscosity in the equation of energy . in this case , it is the same artificial viscosity for both the original coordinate and the transformed one because the equation of energy is scalar .",
    "therefore , @xmath95    in this paper , we also use the bulk viscosity introduced by @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 changes to @xmath97\\lambda_1      \\theta(-\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{v } ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper , we use @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a constant coefficient , and @xmath101 is the sound velocity .",
    "the introduction of the linear bulk viscosity of equation ( [ eq : avgm , mlutdim , org ] ) implies that the viscosity is active even for infinitesimal compression . in other words ,",
    "the fluid is viscous even if there is no shock . in order to reduce the viscosity in the absence of the shock ,",
    "so - called `` bulk switches '' have been proposed ( @xcite , ) .",
    "we use the switch @xmath102 multiplied to @xmath96 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a parameter which determines the decay time scale of the artificial viscosity after shock .",
    "in this paper , we use @xmath105 and @xmath106 , following and @xcite .",
    "we discuss the choice of @xmath107 in section [ sec : test_shock ] .",
    "finally , we introduce a new term which weakens the artificial viscosity when fluid is compressed in one direction , but is expanding in other directions , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a positive coefficient .",
    "consider the case that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "obviously , @xmath112 , and there is no compression",
    ". however , numerically determined @xmath70 can be negative due to truncation errors and in that case equation ( [ eq : avgm , mlutdim , org ] ) can result in the strong artificial viscosity .",
    "we can reduce this errortic activation of the artificial viscosity using this term . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath113 . we multiply @xmath96 by @xmath102 and @xmath114 . thus ,",
    "in our study , we use @xmath115 instead of @xmath96 .      as we have discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , the rearrangement of particles is necessary to handle large deformations of inviscid fluid , if we use high - order schemes .",
    "therefore , in this section , we describe how to rearrange particles . in this paper , we consider two dimensional cases .",
    "first , we consider periodic boundary . in this case , particles are rearranged to the initial pattern . of cause",
    ", the initial pattern does not have large deviations of the number density of particles .",
    "for example , consider the case in which initial pattern is a grid .",
    "if the distribution of particles has become distorted as in the left - hand side panel in figure [ fig : ref , grid ] , we rearrange particles in a grid pattern ( see the right in figure [ fig : ref , grid ] ) .        next , we consider the fluid with the surface . in this paper , particles are rearranged to the original grid pattern .",
    "consider the case where particles are distributed as in the left - hand side panel of figure [ fig : ref , surf ] .",
    "first , we connect surface particles with lines which are expressed as black lines in the central panel of figure [ fig : ref , surf ] .",
    "then , particles are placed on the intersections of the black line and the grid line , for example , the black dots in the central panel of figure [ fig : ref , surf ] . if the interval between particles is smaller than @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the width of a grid , one particle is removed . finally , we put particles on grid points as in the right - hand side panel of figure [ fig : ref , surf ]",
    ".        the physical quantity , @xmath27 , of a new particle @xmath17 is calculated by using @xmath118 , where @xmath118 is the quantity of particle @xmath8 before rearrangement .",
    "@xmath119    finally , we describe the criterion for rearrangement .",
    "typically , rearrangement is required when local distribution of particles has become highly anisotropic .",
    "consider a simple velocity field with linear shear , such as @xmath120 , applied to initial particle distribution of a tilted cartesian grid ( see the left side panel of figure [ fig : ref , shear ] ) .",
    "particles move through shear velocity and the distribution transforms to that given by the central panel of figure [ fig : ref , shear ] . very soon ,",
    "large difference between distance of particles in one direction and that in the orthogonal direction develops as shown in the right panel in figure [ fig : ref , shear ] .        in order to detect this kind of anisotropy",
    ", we use an approximate kernel weighted moment tensor defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a sign function , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the parameter @xmath127 equal to the width of the kernel function @xmath34",
    ". therefore , if @xmath128 is larger than @xmath127 , the value of @xmath34 is zero .",
    "the criterion of the rearrangement is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath132 , and @xmath133 is a constant coefficient .",
    "note that it is difficult to apply this criterion to the fluid surface , since it lacks particles near the surface .",
    "hence , we apply rearrangement at a constant time interval , when we need to follow the surface .      in this section",
    ", we derive our high - order mesh - free fully lagrangian discretization of equations of continuity , moment and energy .",
    "the original set of partial differential equations are given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 is pressure .",
    "these equations are discretized using equation ( [ eq : my , sf1 ] ) , and the artificial viscosity is added .",

    ", we can express boundary conditions directly , since our method is based on fitting polynomials for intensive variables .",
    "first , we consider a free surface . at the free surface ,",
    "the pressure of the fluid is same as that of thin air or vacuum .",
    "thus , the boundary condition is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 is a constant pressure of the assumed air .",

    "the boundary condition is @xmath159 here , @xmath160 is the velocity perpendicular to the boundary . in the case of the non - slipping boundary",

    "therefore , for the non - slip fixed boundary , the boundary condition is @xmath161 finally , at the slipping contact discontinuity , pressure and velocity perpendicular to the boundary are continuous .",

    "the error is given by @xmath393 it is clear that the error grows rapidly after @xmath394 orbits . from figure",
    "[ fig : disk ] , we can see that the error becomes large at the outer edge after @xmath395 orbits .",
    "therefore , if we can improve the treatment of the outer edge , we may be able to reduce the error .",

    "one limitation of our current cphsf scheme is that there is no easy way to handle topological changes of fluid , for example the collision of two droplets . in principle",
    ", we can handle collisions by detecting the moment of the collision and change the surface particles ( usually with special boundary conditions ) to bulk particles .",
    "however , finding the exact moment of collision for each of surface particles involved can be very expensive .",
    "therefore approximate treatment is practically necessary .",
    "another problem is that we currently need implicit time integration in order to apply boundary conditions .",
    "an explicit or semi - implicit scheme would be better , and should be applicable at least to the bulk of the fluid .",
    "standard sph scheme and its variations are not high order and can not handle free surfaces .",
    "we formulate cphs , a high - order mesh - free method .",
    "cphsf can handle kelvin - helmholtz instability and rayleigh - taylor instability better than previous sph methods do .",
    "we also simulate the gravity wave and dam break .",
    "the results are excellent . additionally , the cold keplerian disk , which is very important in astrophysics , can be calculated for much larger time than possible with previous mesh - free methods .",
    "cphsf does not exactly satisfy the conservation laws .",
    "however we showed that the violation of the conservation laws is acceptable , because of the lagrangian nature and high - order accuracy of cphsf .",
    "therefore we conclude that cphsf is more useful than previous mesh - free method .",

    "<S> we have applied our method to many test problems and obtained excellent result . </S>",
    "<S> our method is not conservative , since particles do not have mass or energy , but only their densities . </S>",
