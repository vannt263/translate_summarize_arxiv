    "during recent years , soft x - ray observations of the quiescent counterparts to sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 have revealed periodicities in the 58  s range and spindown rates of @xmath1@xmath2 s s@xmath3 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998a , hurley et al .",
    "these rotation periods are similar to that of sgr 0526 - 66 , which displayed an 8  s periodicity during the giant flare of 1979 march 5 ( mazets et al .",

    "rays ( murakami et al .",
    "1994 ) to a position consistent with a radio synchrotron nebula that may be a plerionic snr ( kulkarni & frail 1993 ) ; however a recent more accurate localization of the bursting source provides evidence that the sgr is displaced from the radio nebula core ( hurley et al .",
    "1999d ) . sgr 1627 - 41 , discovered in 1998 ( @xcite ) , is also positionally coincident with a young snr ( hurley et al .",
    "1999e , woods et al .",
    "1999a , smith , bradt & levine 1999 ) .",
    "however , deep x ",
    "ray observations of sgr 1627 - 41 ( hurley et al . 2000 ) have so far failed to verify any x  ray periodicity in the quiescent source .",
    "the association of sgrs with young snrs suggests that they are young neutron stars .",
    "the long rotation periods and rapid spindown rates , in the absence of any evidence for binary companions , can be accounted for if the spindown is driven by an ultra - strong magnetic field , e.g. , @xmath5  gauss , as invoked in the magnetar model ( duncan & thompson 1992 ,  dt92 \" ; paczyski 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ,  td95 \" ) .",
    "magnetars , or  magnetically - powered neutron stars , \" could form via an @xmath6-@xmath7 dynamo action in hot , nascent neutron stars if they are born spinning rapidly enough ( dt92 ; thompson & duncan 1993 ,  td93 \" ) .",
    "magnetism may be strong enough within these stars to evolve diffusively over sgr lifetimes of @xmath8 years , driving internal heat dissipation that would keep the neutron stars hot and x - ray bright ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) . above a flux density of @xmath9 g , the evolving field inevitably induces stresses in the solid crust that cause it to yield or fracture ( td95 ) .",
    "such magnetically - driven starquakes may account for the  ordinary \" sgr bursts , which have many statistical properties in common with earthquakes ( cheng et al .",
    "1996 ; palmer 1999 ; gogus et al .  1999 ; gogus et al .  2000 ) .",
    "less common and more catastrophic magnetic instabilities , perhaps involving large propagating fractures , are thought to produce giant flares ( td95 ) .",
    "the non - thermal persistent emission of the sgrs has also been proposed to be a consequence of magnetic activity : either through persistent fracturing of the crust driven by the hall electric field ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) or through persistent magnetospheric currents that are excited by twisting motions of the crust during outbursts ( thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we note that the observed spindown histories of sgrs are _ not _ well - fit by the idealization of vacuum magnetic dipole radiation [ mdr ] ( kouveliotou et al .  1998a , 1999 ; marsden et al .",
    "1999 ; woods et al .  1999b , 2000 ) .",
    "indeed , spindown torques in active magnetars can be enhanced by persistent outflows of relativistic particles and alfvn waves , channeled by a strong magnetic field ( thompson & blaes 1998 ; harding , contopoulos & kazanas 1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) and also strongly modulated by material ejected during bursting activity ( woods et al .",
    "it remains possible that the smooth spindown in some _ inactive _ candidate magnetars ( such as 1e 1841 - 045 ) is well fit by mdr ( vasisht & gotthelf 1997 ; gotthelf , vasisht & dotani 1999 ) .",
    "the observed spindown in sgrs is consistent with dipole fields weaker than the qed strength ( @xmath10 g ) , but only if a persistent outflow of particles carries away substantially more energy than is observed in x - rays ( harding , contopoulos & kazanas 1999 ; marsden et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "accretion - powered alternatives to the magnetar model have also been considered ( e.g. , van paradijs , taam & van den heuvel 1995 ; li 1999 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; alpar 2000 ) .",
    "such models make reasonable fits to the continuous x - ray emissions and spindown histories of sgrs and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , but they offer no good explanation for the hyper - eddington burst and flare emissions that are the defining property of sgrs ( cf .",

    "of the four known sgrs , this object is the only one without an identified snr surrounding it .",
    "however , the recently - verified source position ( vasisht et al .  1994 ; hurley et al .  1999a ; murakami et al .  1999 ; frail , kulkarni & bloom 1999 ) lies just outside the edge of g42.8 + 0.6 , a @xmath11-year - old galactic snr .",
    "a parallel can be drawn with the other giant flare source , sgr 0526 - 66 , which lies near the edge of , but just _ inside _ , the young snr n49 in the lmc ( cline et al .",
    "note that several mechanisms could plausibly impart a recoil velocity @xmath12 km s@xmath3 to a magnetar at birth , sufficient to propel it outside its remnant in @xmath8 years ( dt92 ) .",
    "sgr 1900 + 14 was first detected in 1979 , when it emitted three bursts of soft gamma - rays of moderate intensity ( mazets et al .",
    "the source again became burst active for a short while in 1992 when a handful of events were recorded ( kouveliotou 1993 ) . in 1998",
    "may , sgr 1900 + 14 entered an unprecedented level of burst activity in both frequency and intensity ( kouveliotou et al .  1998b , hurley et al .",
    "purely by chance , an asca ( 210 kev ) observation less than one month prior to the source reactivation in 1998 led to the discovery of 5.16 pulsations from the quiescent counterpart to the sgr ( hurley et al .",
    "subsequent rxte pca ( 220 kev ) observations following the reactivation of the sgr allowed for a measurement of the period derivative @xmath13 ( kouveliotou et al . 1999 ; woods et al .",

    "a giant flare from sgr1900 + 14 , lasting more than five minutes , was detected by konus - wind , _ ulysses and bepposax ( cline et al . 1998 ; hurley et al .",

    "gamma rays during the first second were extraordinarily intense , overwhelming detectors on several other spacecrafts as well , such as the near earth astreroid rendevous mission ( which went into a protective shut - down mode ) and the proportional counter array on the rossi x - ray timing explorer .",
    "the compton gamma - ray observatory was earth - occulted for this flare .",
    "_    the 5.16  s neutron star rotation period was clearly detected during the giant flare .",
    "indeed , the periodic signal was intense enough to produce a marked 5.16-second modulation in the height of the earth s ionosphere , which affected long - wavelength radio transmissions ( inan et al .",
    "1999 ) , a remarkable effect for a star @xmath14 light years away .",
    "about 40 seconds after the onset of the flare , a 1.03 s repetitive pattern ( 4th harmonic of 5.16 s fundamental ) was observed to set in gradually ( feroci et al .",
    "1999 ; mazets et al .",
    "1999 ) , unlike any emission previously detected from any source .",
    "a radio afterglow was soon found with the very large array ( frail , kulkarni & bloom 1999 ) .",
    "this source , the only radio point source unambiguously associated with an sgr , was apparent in the error box of sgr1900 + 14 on 1998",
    "september 3 , but it faded away in less than one week , giving evidence for an abrupt outflow of relativistic particles during the flare .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a comparative analysis of bepposax and _ ulysses _ observations of the august 27th event .",
    "our main goal is a thorough description of the data that may be cogent to understanding sgr giant flares , including some novel comparisons with the 1979 march 5th event .",
    "the observed properties are then qualitatively interpreted in the context of the magnetar hypothesis , deriving insights and constraints on the magnetic field structure and mechanisms for large flares in sgrs . a companion paper ( thompson et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper ii ) derives a more quantitative and rigorous treatment of the physics and magnetic field structure in this and similar objects .",
    "the grbm consists of the anticoincidence detectors of the phoswich detection system ( pds , frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) , comprised of four optically independent csi(na ) shields forming a square box , surrounding the main pds detectors .",
    "each shield is 1 cm thick and has a geometric area of about 1136 @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum effective area for a burst with a typical power law spectrum arriving at normal incidence is about 420 @xmath15 for unit 1 or 3 ( the optimum units ) , when shadowing by spacecraft and experiment structures and the detector response are taken into account .",
    "the grbm electronics records data from each shield in both real - time ( low time resolution ) and triggered ( high time resolution ) modes .",
    "the real - time data consist of 1 s resolution count rates in the 40 - 700 and @xmath16100 kev energy ranges .",
    "the triggered data consist of : ( a ) 7.8125 ms data for 8 s prior to the trigger time , ( b ) 0.48828 ms data for 10 s starting at the trigger time , and ( c ) 7.8125 ms data for 88 s starting at 10 s after the trigger time .",
    "these count rates are all recorded in the 40 - 700 kev energy range .",
    "independent of the trigger , 256-channel energy spectra are taken every 128 s , for each of the four shields .",
    "these are integrated over fixed time intervals , and are therefore mainly useful for calibration purposes .",
    "in fact , given the typical time scales of cosmic grbs , the housekeeping spectral data can only be used for obtaining the average energy spectra of bright grbs , when they can be detected over 128 s of background .",
    "the 1 s real - time data in the two energy channels , 40 - 700 kev and @xmath16700 kev , allow for some spectral reconstruction .",
    "the two count rates overlap in the nominal energy range from 100 to 700 kev . from these",
    ", the 40 - 100 kev and 100 - 700 kev rates may be derived , with assumptions about the number of counts above 700  kev25% of its maximum value at 700 kev ( the maximum is reached at @xmath17200 kev ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fact , combined with a photon spectrum decreasing with energy ( in our case the spectrum is very hard only in the first seconds , when we do nt make any use of the realtime ratemeters ) , results in an estimated number of counts that is negligible with respect to the count rates in 40 - 100 and 100 - 700 kev .",
    "for this reason we simply preferred not to make any correction , which would be almost entirely arbitrary , and leave the results that we present subject to this assumption . ]",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , these ratemeters can be used to extract a 2-channel spectrum , with a time resolution of 1 s. note that the events that are recorded in these two ratemeters are exactly the same in their overlapping energy range , and are therefore completely covariant , significantly lowering the statistical error in their difference .",
    "the energy resolution of a shield ranges from 15% to 30% , depending on the energy and position of interaction of the photon .",

    "( 1997 ) .      the _ ulysses grb detector ( hurley et al .",

    "the detector is mounted on a magnetometer boom far from the body of the spacecraft , and therefore has a practically unobstructed view of the full sky . because the _ ulysses mission is in interplanetary space , the instrument benefits from an exceptionally stable background .",
    "the energy range is @xmath17 25 - 150 kev .",
    "the lower energy threshold is set by a discriminator , and is in practice an approximate one ; photons with energies @xmath19 kev can penetrate the housing and be counted either because of the rather poor energy resolution at low energies , or , in the case of very intense events , due to pulse pile - up . for the 1998 august 27 event , an intense flux of low energy photons was present , and both of these effects operated to some extent .",
    "the upper energy threshold is set by a discriminator , and also by the decreasing detector efficiency .",

    "the available real - time data from _ ulysses and bepposax gamma ray burst detectors consist of count rates over 0.5  s in the 25150  kev band ( _ ulysses ) , and count rates over 1  s in the 40700 , 40100 and 100700  kev bands ( bepposax ) . in both instruments these rates are accumulated onboard over fixed time intervals . taking into account the location of sgr  1900 + 14 and the two spacecraft positions , we find that the onboard integration times of the two experiments are such that the first time bin containing photons from the giant flare starts for _ ulysses at 37335.168 sod ( seconds of day august 27th , 1998 ) and for grbm at 37335.05653 sod . therefore , purely by chance , the two low - resolution light curves are synchronized to within approximately 100  ms ( @xmath17 0.02 cycles of the neutron star rotation ) , and they can be used for time - resolved spectral analysis .",

    "the envelope of the light curve decays smoothly , and provides an important clue to the radiative mechanism .",
    "the simplest choice of an exponential function @xmath34 adequately describes the intermediate portion of the decay ( fig .  [ 3decays ] ) .",

    "this leads us to consider a second parameterization motivated by a cooling fireball which is trapped on the closed magnetic field lines of a neutron star ( paper ii ) : @xmath37 in this expression , the cooling luminosity is assumed to vary as a power of the _ remaining _ fireball energy , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the time at which the fireball boundary propagates to its center and the fireball evaporates .",

    "the rotationally - averaged x - ray flux shows no dramatic change during the emergence of the pulsations ( fig .",
    "[ smooth_decay ] ) , which implies that the the pulsations result from a redistribution of a ( nearly ) conserved x - ray luminosity .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our inference that the thermal x - rays escaping from the trapped fireball are reprocessed through an extended pair - dominated halo during the first 40 s.    what causes these x - ray jets to form ?",
    "their phase stability suggests that they are tied to surface features on the neutron star .",
    "we now argue that the burst light curve provides a template of the neutron star s surface magnetic field , and indicates that it has a complicated , multipolar structure .",

    "however , we are not aware of any mechanism that could produce such an effect , and we are led to the conclusion that it is probably a coincidence .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the konus observation of the late time evolution of the four - peaked structure ( @xcite ) , in which there is a convergence to a double - peaked structure .",
    "plausible internal modes of the neutron star have periods much shorter than 1.0 s.   the longest - period mode in the crust is the fundamental toroidal oscillation with @xmath119 s ( duncan 1998 ) ; and the lowest - frequency alfvn modes in the liquid interior are also probably too fast [ eq .

    "[ folded_grbm ] , except that the strongest peak is peak 1 ( just after the minimum ) rather than peak 2 .",
    "a magnetar s light curve during active periods could be dominated by persistent magnetospheric currents , driven by twisting motions of the crust (  5 in thompson et al .",
    "this mechanism potentially explains the x - ray brightening and dramatic light - curve change in the aftermath of the august 27th flare ( woods et al .",
    "1999b ; murakami et al .",
    "because the crust is nearly incompressible and stably - stratified , with degeneracy pressure in hydrostatic balance with gravity that is much stronger than any lattice shear or magnetic stresses , a large - scale propagating fracture of the neutron star crust must involve a predominantly rotational motion .",
    "collimation of the x - ray flux from a trapped fireball is discussed in paper ii .",
    "we summarize the relevant physics here .",
    "the two photon eigenmodes are linearly polarized when vacuum polarization dominates the dielectric properties of the medium .",
    "the compton scattering cross section of the extraordinary mode ( or e - mode : @xmath120 ) is strongly suppressed : @xmath121 ( e.g. herold 1979 ) .",
    "this suppression greatly increases the radiative transport rate both from the surface of the neutron star ( paczyski 1992 ) and across a confining magnetic field ( td95 ) .",
    "however , the scattering opacity of the e - mode rises rapidly with radius ( e.g. , @xmath122 in a dipole geometry ) . as a result ,",
    "most of the radiative transport occurs close to the surface of the star .",
    "the rapid growth of the e - mode opacity then provides a mechanism for self - collimation : the e - radiation can escape only by pushing the suspended matter to the side .",
    "a second effect involves the conversion of the e - mode to the ordinary ( or o - mode ; @xmath123 ) , which occurs effectively via both photon splitting and compton scattering near the e - mode photosphere ( td95 ; miller 1995 ) . because o - mode scattering is not magnetically - suppressed , the energy flux converted into the o - mode is tremendously super - eddington , and it must drive a diffuse hydrodynamical jet , outward along channels of magnetic flux that are optically - thin to the e - mode .",
    "an estimate of @xmath124 is given by the condition that the relativistic , o - mode driven wind has thomson optical depth near unity across a height @xmath125 .",
    "this implies @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the outflow or jet solid angle ( cf .",

    "[ ulysses_grbm_diff ] and at @xmath128 s in fig .  7 of mazets et al .",
    "this is consistent with advection of thermal x - ray photons from hotter regions , closer to the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the combined _ ulysses and grbm lightcurves provide clear evidence for a hard component in the spectrum of the august 27 event .",
    "the early appearance of modest dips , at a phase coincident with the late deep minima , only in the grbm data ( hard x - rays ) points to a site closer to the star for the _ early hard emission than for the soft one .",
    "in addition , the best fits to the time averaged spectra ( see  4.2 ) confirm the persistence of a non - thermal component at times @xmath12970  s after the event onset .",
    "this hard emission , which occurs well after the initial spike , may be related to the persistent alfvn wave dissipation that ( we have argued ) powers the excess emission during the smooth 40-s tail (  [ smooth ] ) .",
    "however , the persistence of the hard component is more consistent with particle acceleration driven by the hyper - eddington photon flux : for example , at the boundaries of the x - ray jets , far out in the magnetosphere where the photon pressure begins to exceed the magnetic dipole pressure .",
    "further evidence for radially extended hard emission is provided by the time - resolved hardness ratio : the spectrum is hardest during the broad troughs that occur at 5.16-s intervals ( fig .  [ folded_ul ] ) . _ _    a hard spectral component ( photon index @xmath130 )",
    "was previously reported in the first part of the outburst ( feroci et al .",

    "this far from the neutron star , energetic charges cool primarily by inverse compton scattering .",
    "closer to the star , synchrotron emission can contribute significantly to cooling .",
    "observations of future outbursts at energies @xmath132 will be sensitive to the compactness of the non - thermal emission region , and thus will be able to distinguish between these two regimes .",
    "there are strikingly similarities between the giant sgr outbursts observed on 1979 march 5 and 1998 august 27 .",
    "both events radiated @xmath133 erg in x - rays and gamma rays , which exceeds the measured fluences of all other sgr outbursts by @xmath134 orders of magnitude .",
    "both events began with a brief and very intense gamma - ray spike , which was followed by a softer tail more than a thousand times longer in duration than ordinary sgr bursts .",
    "also , in both events , the bursting flux was modulated by a large amplitude at the rotation period of the star ( with two prominent sub - pulses in the march 5 event as compared with four in august 27 ) , with similar intensity - hardness anticorrelation in the main pulses .",
    "considering the many other characteristics shared by these two sources , there is compelling evidence that the two sgrs are physically similar stars which evolved through similar stages to reach similar catastrophic instabilities .",
    "moreover , the discontinuous distribution of outburst energies / durations suggests that the giant flare instability is _ qualitatively distinct _ from the instability of ordinary sgr outbursts ; i.e. , different in kind , not just in degree .",
    "it is not known how this sort of bimodal behavior could be driven by an external trigger like accretion ; but promising mechanisms are provided in the magnetar model ( paper ii ) .    the most striking _ difference _ between the august 27 and march",

    "[ signelc ] , suggests that the main pulse splits into three jets , and the interpulse into two .",
    "a very strong hardness - intensity correlation within the jets would be necessary for the suggested 1-s jets of b79 to be reconciled with the smooth light curves of m79 at lower energies . thus jetlike substructure , if real , may be more profound in data sets including higher - energy photons .",
    "we searched for this effect .",
    "the top panel of fig .",

    "all the observations concur that any smoothly - declining , unmodulated component in the march 5 tail lasted for @xmath139 s ( as opposed to @xmath58 s for august 27 ) and involved a portion of the post - spike emissions that is much smaller than the fraction 0.2 estimated for the august 27 event .    one final note on the rates of giant flares .",
    "the observed number of events ( 2 giant flares out of 4 - 5 known sgrs ) is consistent with the hypothesis that flares occur in _ all _ known sgrs at a rate @xmath137 per 20 yrs , per source .",

    "independent evidence for a particle outflow comes from the detection of a radio afterglow which faded in the days following the event ( frail , kulkarni & bloom 1999 ) . _",
    "the rapid drop in x - ray flux at the end of the burst gives strong evidence for an emitting resevoir of energy that evaporates completely in a finite time .",
    "the envelope of the light curve , from 40 s to the termination of the burst , is well fit by the contracting surface of a thermal photon - pair plasma , confined by the strong magnetic field and anchored to the rotating surface of the star ( eqn .",
    "( 1 ) ; cf .",
    "td95 ) . about 80% of the post - spike fluence",
    "is associated with this phase of large amplitude pulsations .",
    "the smooth , soft tail has a harder spectrum than the subsequent emissions , and the measured x - ray flux lies well above the trapped fireball light curve that fits so well after @xmath17 40 s. the flattening of the light curve , and the decay of this excess emission , occurs simultaneously with the emergence of the four large - amplitude sub - peaks .",
    "given these facts , we associate the excess emission ( representing @xmath109% of the post - spike fluence ) with compton heating by an extended corona of hot pair plasma ( paper ii ) .",
    "this heating must occur outside the trapped fireball , and is plausibly driven by a persistent output of alfvn waves from the neutron star . in this model ,",
    "the appearance of the large - amplitude pulsations coincides with the evaporation of the pair plasma and a contraction of the scattering photosphere to the surface of the trapped fireball , which sits congruent with the confining magnetic field .",
    "the persistent alfvnic heating could be driven by crustal shear waves , excited at the initial instability ( blaes et al 1989 ; duncan 1998 ) ; or by persistent but declining seismic activity in an active fault zone .",
    "the large - amplitude pulsations require narrow collimation of the x - ray flux , which is provided by the rapid increase in the e - mode scattering cross section with distance from the neutron star .",
    "in addition , the o - mode has a much stronger coupling to matter than the e - mode and will flow hydrodynamically , at mildly relativistic speed , along open channels of magnetic flux .",
    "both modes are emitted through x - ray fan jets , which are fed from below by rapid radiative diffusion of e - mode photons out of the trapped reservoir of hot plasma ( followed by conversion to the o - mode through scattering or splitting ) .",
    "collimated x - ray emission is a natural consequence of super - eddington radiative transfer in magnetic fields stronger than @xmath142 gauss (  6.4 in td95 ;  [ fourpeaksec ] ; paper ii ) .",
    "the light curve of the august 27 flare provides valuable information about the magnetic geometry in sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the four sub - pulses require the presence of higher magnetic multipoles  perhaps the most tangible evidence yet for a complex magnetic geometry in an isolated neutron star . in this picture , the observation of two ( rather than four ) sub - pulses in the march 5 event simply reflects the chance location of the outburst , and the differing structure of the magnetic field in that second source .",
    "the joint analysis of the _ ulysses and grbm spectra shows that a hard spectral component persisted long after the initial hard spike .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by the time - resolved hardness ratio , which shows that the burst spectrum is hardest during rotation - cycle minima .",
    "we have noted two possible mechanisms for accelerating non - thermal particles : persistent alfvnic heating , for which there is a clear evidence at times @xmath14340  s ; or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at the boundaries of the x - ray jets responsible for the four - peaked repetitive pattern .",
    "_    finally , we re - analyzed the signe data of the first 32  s of the 1979 march 5th event from sgr 0526 - 66 , and isee-3 data for the first @xmath17150  s of the same event .",
    "we found more properties that are shared with the august 27 event , lending support to the hypothesis that similar physical instabilities drove both outbursts .",
    "in particular , we find that the spectral evolution across the pulse is strikingly similar to that of the giant flare from sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "a trapped fireball model appears to fit the march 5 light curve better than a simple exponential , just as in the case of the august 27 event , although the short duration of the available light curve and the small dynamic range ( @xmath74 ) in flux do not allow a definitive conclusion .",
    "we also considered the suggestion of jetlike substructure on 1-s timescales in the signe march 5th light curve ( barat et al .",
    "1979 ) . by a standard epoch - folding approach",
    ", we found no statistically - compelling evidence that such substructure emerged during the first 32 seconds of the event .",
    "we conclude that the magnetar model offers a promising framework for understanding giant flares from sgrs .",
    "the basic picture of an initial relativistic outflow followed by diffusive cooling of a trapped , thermal fireball seems robust . but a detailed understanding of the radiative transport will involve mastering several complications , including : the effects of bulk hydrodynamical streaming , the large variations of the radiative transport coefficients arising from inhomogeneities in the background magnetic field , a non - dipolar magnetic geometry , and the behavior of a pair atmosphere that is simultaneously heated by alfvn waves and irradiated with x - rays from a trapped fireball . much work will be needed to test the physical mechanisms suggested here and in paper ii , and to make a quantitative comparison with alternative models .",

    "<S> the giant flare of 1998 august 27 from sgr 1900 + 14 was extraordinary in many ways : it was the most intense flux of gamma rays ever detected from a source outside our solar system ; it was longer than any previously detected burst from a soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) in our galaxy by more than an order of magnitude ; and it showed a remarkable four - peaked , periodic pattern in hard x - rays with the same rotation period that was found modulating soft x - rays from the star in quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> the event was detected by several gamma - ray experiments in space , including the _ ulysses gamma - ray burst detector and the bepposax gamma ray burst monitor . </S>",
    "<S> these instruments operate in different energy ranges , and comparisons of their measurements reveal complex patterns of spectral evolution as the intensity varies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a joint analysis of the bepposax and _ ulysses data and discuss some implications of these results for the sgrs . we also present newly - analyzed venera / signe and isee-3 data on the 1979 march 5 giant flare from an sgr in the large magellanic cloud ( sgr 0526 - 66 ) , and compare them with the august 27 event . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the hypothesis that giant flares are due to catastrophic magnetic instabilities in highly magnetized neutron stars , or </S>",

    "<S> in particular , observations indicate that the initial hard spike involved a relativistic outflow of pairs and hard gamma rays , plausibly triggered by a large propagating fracture in the crust of a neutron star with a field exceeding 10@xmath0 gauss </S>",
    "<S> . later stages in the light curve are accurately fit by a model for emission from the envelope of a magnetically - confined pair - photon fireball , anchored to the surface of the rotating star , which contracts as it emits x - rays and then evaporates completely in a finite time . </S>",
    "<S> the complex four - peaked shape of the light curve likely provides the most direct evidence known for a multipolar geometry in the magnetic field of a neutron star . _ </S>",
