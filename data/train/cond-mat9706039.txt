    "the slow dynamics ( @xmath3-relaxation ) in supercooled molecular liquids and the glass - transition are two related topics which have received particular attention from the scientific community in the last years @xcite .",
    "significant progress have been made by a sinergetic approach based on theoretical , experimental and more recently on numerical work . nowadays ,",
    "numerical simulations with realistic potentials describing the evolution of molecular system composed by thousand atoms , for time interval longer than @xmath4 , are becoming feasible , allowing a closer check of the theoretical predictions and bridging the gap between experiments and theory .",
    "such long simulations , although are suffering on the deficiency of the potential used compared to the real systems which they aim to simulate , offer a ideal reference for comparing with the novel theoretical predictions concerning the slow dynamics above the glass transition .    in the case where the studied system is water , the interest in interpreting the molecular dynamics in term of glass - transition concepts goes beyond the comparison between the simulated system and the theoretical predictions . indeed , if the experimentally observed non - arrhenius increase of the transport coefficients on supercooling@xcite can be explained within the same framework of simple supercooled liquids@xcite , the presence of hidden thermodynamics anomalies at ambient pressure@xcite does not have to be invoked@xcite .",
    "in the first paper of this series@xcite we have tested mode coupling theory ( mct)@xcite predictions for the correlation functions of single particle dynamics in water with corresponding quantities calculated from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , carried out for sufficiently long time ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) as to allow the slow dynamics to be observed .",
    "we tried to assess to what extent the mct , which has been shown to describe simple liquids@xcite , is applicable also to the description of the single particle dynamics of ( simulated ) supercooled water , an hydrogen bonded liquid with strong non - isotropic interactions among molecules .",
    "as a result we found that the center of mass tagged particle dynamics can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of mct . this result stimulated us to make the comparison more stringent and to extend it to the collective center of mass dynamics .",
    "with one further year of computer time on three workstations working full - time , the limit of @xmath7 of continuous simulation time has been reached , allowing the calculation of the collective properties , for which the noise level can not be reduced averaging over different molecules in the simulated system .",
    "theoretical work based on the mct has mainly focused on simple atomic liquids and on molecular liquids with spherical - symmetric interactions .",
    "only recently the theory has been extended to treat the case of molecular systems with non - isotropic interaction potentials opening the way for a full and detailed quantitative comparison between theory and simulation / experiments for molecular systems@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , preliminary results at the ideal mct level are only available for dipolar hard spheres@xcite , i.e. molecules with a simpler geometry than the water molecule geometry .",
    "such results@xcite strongly supports the validity of general predictions based on the mct for simple liquids .    in this article",
    "we study in detail the @xmath0-vector dependence of the collective dynamics in spc / e water and present evidence in favor of a mct description of the slow @xmath3-relaxation dynamics .",
    "the comparison is performed on a two level scale : ( i ) at qualitative level , we compare the mct prediction for simple liquids ( exemplified by the hard - sphere liquid within the percus - yevick approximation ) with the center of mass dynamics in the case of supercooled spc / e water . although the comparison is by default qualitative , we think that the analogy in the @xmath0 dependence of all relevant parameters is particularly significant .",
    "( ii ) at quantitative level , we compare the spc / e slow dynamics with the dynamics predicted by mct in the late @xmath8-region ; moreover we evaluate the von schweidler exponents @xmath9 and @xmath10 governing the relaxation process ( sec.[sec : theory ] ) and we verify that they are related as mct predicts",
    ".    in both cases the agreement is striking and strongly supports the validity of mct as the correct framework for interpreting the slow collective dynamics in simulated supercooled water .",
    "several review papers present in detail the theory of mode coupling for supercooled liquids , in particular in its _ ideal _ formulation .",
    "a review on the predictions of the theory can be found in ref.@xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly report the main results which are relevant for the reading of the article .",
    "mct aims at describing the slow dynamics in supercooled glass forming simple liquids or in molecular liquids with spherical - symmetric interactions between the molecules .",
    "it provides a description of the time evolution of density and current correlation functions ( correlators in the following ) in the time region where structural relaxation becomes the process which entirely controls the dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ for times longer than the microscopic characteristic time .",
    "mct describes the slowing down of the structural relaxation , which is typical of supercooled liquids , including memory effects in a memory function which depends only on statical quantities ( number density and structure factor @xmath11 ) .    in",
    "the _ ideal _ formulation the loss of correlation is ascribed completely to interaction between fluctuations of density pairs ; all other channels for the decay of correlation , as for example the momentum modes , are completely neglected .",
    "the ideal mct predicts a sharp liquid to glass transition , located at a finite critical temperature @xmath12 , associated with a power - law divergence of the correlation time .",
    "@xmath12 is a purely kinetic transition temperature which describes the freezing of the molecules inside the cages and it does not deal with any thermodynamical anomalous behavior .",
    "the _ ideal_-mct can be considered as a first order approximation in a more complex scheme @xcite ; the kinetic transition is an artifact of the approximations involved and it disappears in the _ extended _ version of mct , where couplings with particle momenta are taken into account .",
    "the power - law increase of the characteristic times predicted by the ideal mct for @xmath13 crosses to a different ( unknown ) relation , to describe the complex activated dynamical processes below @xmath12 .",
    "the concept of @xmath12 retains the meaning of cross - over temperature between two different dynamical behaviors and the prediction of the ideal mct can be used to interpret the slow dynamics above @xmath12 , when hopping effects are negligible .",
    "the ideal mct predicts the existence of a two step relaxation scenario for the slow dynamics in supercooled simple liquids at temperatures close to @xmath12 .",
    "the decay of the correlators , _",
    "i.e. _ the loss of memory of the initial configuration , occurs in a two - step process@xcite : first the normalized correlator @xmath14 approaches a plateau value @xmath15 which is temperature - independent ( non - ergodicity or edwards - anderson parameter ) ; then @xmath14 decays from @xmath15 to zero ( @xmath3-relaxation region ) .",
    "the short times region is strongly affected by the microscopic dynamics , which instead completely disappears in the long time region ( @xmath3-relaxation ) . in the region close to the plateau ( @xmath8-relaxation region )",
    "@xmath14 can be asymptotically expanded near the value @xmath15 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the time scale which characterize the @xmath8-region and @xmath18 is the separation from the critical point ( at fixed number density @xmath19 ) .",
    "the function @xmath20 ( also called @xmath8-correlator ) is solution of the asymptotic equation    @xmath21 ( \\tilde{z})+ [ \\tilde{z}g(\\tilde{z})]^2=0 \\label{eq : equation}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is the scaled time , @xmath23 means the laplace transform and @xmath24 is the laplace conjugate of @xmath25 ; @xmath26 is the exponent parameter@xcite .",

    "the range of validity of these expansions for @xmath28 is limited at small @xmath35 by the microscopic dynamics time and at large @xmath35 by the @xmath3-relaxation time .    in the @xmath3-relaxation region",
    "another time scale appears , @xmath36 ; in terms of the rescaled time @xmath37 the behavior of the correlator near the plateau is described in the leading order by a power law dominated by the exponent @xmath9 . including the next to leading order corrections the departure from @xmath15 in the early @xmath3-relaxation region is given by @xmath38 the amplitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "strongly depend on the physical features of the studied liquid and they have been explicitly calculated for a few models @xcite .",

    "the correlators obey the so - called time - temperature superposition principle , i.e. it is possible to scale the same correlator evaluated at different @xmath2 on a single master curve , i.e. @xmath43    for times much longer than @xmath36 the mode - coupling dynamical equations can not be solved either analytically nor asymptotically . from numerical solutions developed for simple potentials it has been shown that a kohlrausch - williams - watts ( kkw ) stretched exponential form , i.e. @xmath44 \\label{eq : k}\\ ] ] can be used to empirically fit the last part of the @xmath14 decay .    if we specialize the previous equations to the case in which @xmath45 is the intermediate scattering function @xmath46 , the self correlation function @xmath47 or the transverse current correlation @xmath48 , the non - ergodicity factor @xmath15 , the critical amplitudes @xmath49 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the fitting parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 becomes @xmath0-dependent quantities .",
    "therefore the comparison between theory and experiments can be extended from the time dependence of @xmath45 and the temperature dependence of the correlation times to the @xmath0-dependence of the above mentioned parameter .",
    "the mct set of coupled integro - differential equations can be numerically solved once the static structure factor @xmath11 is known .",

    "we refer the interest reader to refs.@xcite , where the frequency range above @xmath67 has been studied in detail . the second decay process , from the non - ergodicity parameter to zero , has a strong @xmath2 and @xmath0 dependence .",
    "this monotonic decay ( the @xmath3-relaxation ) becomes slower and slower on decreasing the temperature . at the lowest simulated @xmath2",
    ", the @xmath3-relaxation is clearly separated from the microscopic time window and appears in a time region which was never explored before due to the long cpu time required to perform equilibrated molecular dynamics simulations .    to quantify the @xmath0 and @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath3-relaxation we fit all correlators for times longer than 7 ps ( to avoid the interference of the oscillatory sound modes ) with a stretched exponential function ( eq.[eq : k ] ) . for @xmath2",
    "higher that 230 k , the @xmath3 relaxation time is smaller than 20 ps and the @xmath3 relaxation process , being superimposed to the collective sound modes , can be fitted with different parameters .",

    "thus , the medium range order characteristic of network forming liquids@xcite , is the most stable structure in the system .",
    "the enhanced stability at @xmath74 can be predicted independently from @xmath76 by calculating @xmath77 , i.e. on the basis of the so - called de gennes narrowing .",
