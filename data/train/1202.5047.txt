    "+ a second hypothesis is that the chains have parallel magnetizations within one given layer but the layers are af ordered .",
    "this could in principle give rise to metamagnetism with a `` spin - flop '' transition at sufficiently high magnetic fields which was not observed up to 5 t .",

    "[ fig : figure4 ] ( b ) ) , so that the net in - plane magnetization is zero at zero field and the resulting order within the planes is _",
    "antiferromagnetic_. in this case the observed magnetization can be due to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , which is allowed by symmetry ( since the oxygen atom at the center of the cu@xmath50-o - cu@xmath56 bond does _ not _ bear a center of inversion symmetry ) and produces a net out - of - plane moment , able to rotate around the cu - o bond axis under a magnetic field .",

    "the above inferred concentration could also be compatible with the observation of a very small moment through neutron scattering , but too small to be detectable through muon - spin - resonance ( @xmath65sr ) @xcite .",
