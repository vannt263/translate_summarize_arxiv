    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a dilute gas of trapped ultracold alkali atoms has been observed by several experimental groups @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the possibility of understanding the nature of the condensate wave function , and in particular , its phase @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the bec phase transition occurs due the breaking of a global gauge symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "theoretically , a bec may be modeled by writing down the interacting many - body hamiltonian in terms of boson creation and annihilation operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the order parameter is postulated to be the condensate wave function @xmath3=@xmath4= @xmath5 , where @xmath6=@xmath7 is the condensate density and @xmath8 is the phase of the wave function .",
    "the hamiltonian is gauge invariant , but the order parameter breaks this symmetry . using the dynamical equation for @xmath2 found from the hamiltonian operator , the time evolution of the condensate wave function @xmath3 can be shown to satisfy the following gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite : @xmath9 \\psi , \\eqno(1.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the external potential and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the atomic scattering length and mass , respectively .",
    "although this equation has an underlying quantum nature , the condensate has a macroscopic extent , suggesting the observation of quantum effects on a macroscopic scale .    in a striking experiment @xcite , andrews _",
    "et al _ have shown the existence of the macroscopic quantum phase difference between two bose condensates : they designed a double - well trap by using a laser sheet to create a high barrier within a trapped condensate .",
    "on _ switching off _ this barrier , the two condensates overlapped to produce an interference pattern , showing phase coherence .",
    "more interestingly , by _ lowering _ the laser sheet intensity , the barrier gets lowered , making it possible for the condensates to _ tunnel _ through the barrier .",
    "thus this double - well trap is analogous to a superconductor josephson junction @xcite , and is referred to as the boson josephson junction ( bjj ) . in an interesting paper , smerzi _ et al _ @xcite have set up the tunneling equations for the bjj in a model .",
    "these are two coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the condensate wave functions in the two wells .",
    "they have studied the time evolution of the inter - well population difference and phase difference in this model , and predicted a novel ` self - trapping ' effect , i.e. , the oscillation of the population difference around a non - zero value , for certain initial conditions and parameters .",
    "the tunneling dynamics motivates the following question : is there an underlying geometric phase associated with the time evolution of the condensate wave function in a double - well trap ?",
    "as is well known by now , the concept of a geometric phase has been studied in various contexts , after it was introduced by berry @xcite in quantum mechanics .",
    "it had also been considered much earlier by pancharatnam @xcite in the context of classical optics . geometric phase and its various applications",
    "have been studied intensively for over a decade now @xcite .",
    "such a ( non - integrable ) phase arises when the time evolution of a system is such that the value of a variable in a given state of the system depends on the path along which the state has been reached . in this paper , we calculate the geometric phase associated with the time evolution of the bjj wave function , for both cyclic and non - cyclic evolutions .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec.ii , we first review smerzi et al s @xcite derivation of the tunneling equations . keeping in mind that the geometric phase is gauge independent , we use a certain gauge transformation to reduce these equations to a more convenient form . in sec .",
    "iii , we briefly outline the kinematic approach formulated by mukunda and simon @xcite to define the geometric phase as applied to a two - level system .",
    "we then solve the bjj tunneling equations , which are nonlinear differential equations , numerically by choosing some parameter values as an example . using these solutions , we find the geometric phase explicitly , for both cyclic and non - cyclic evolution of the system . for a cyclic evolution ,",
    "the phase difference and the population difference between the condensates in the two wells return to their original values . for this case , the corresponding geometric phase is half the solid angle generated by a _ unit vector _ whose @xmath0 component and azimuthal angle are given , respectively , by the population difference and the phase difference .",
    "for non - cyclic evolution , an additional phase term is obtained . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that this geometric phase ( for both types of evolution ) can also be obtained by first mapping the tunneling equations to the equation for a unit vector * r * and then identifying it with the tangent * t * of a space curve .",
    "the space curve is described using the so - called natural frame equations , which possess an underlying natural gauge freedom .",
    "the unit triad of vectors can be written down using the form of the condensate wave functions in the two wells .",
    "the concept of fermi - walker parallel transport is then used to identify the geometric phase . in sec.v",
    ", we employ the usual frenet frame to obtain explicit expressions for the curvature and torsion of the space curve that gets associated with the bjj evolution .",
    "section vi contains a summary and discussion .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the model used by smerzi _",
    "et al_@xcite to study the tunneling of the condensate between two wells .",
    "let the total number of atoms in the double - well trap be @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the number of atoms in each well , such that @xmath17 . to study the tunneling , the solution for the gpe ( eq .",

    "in this paper , we obtain the geometric phase associated with the evolution in eqs .",

    "the advantage of the gauge transformation is that this matrix is traceless .",

    "the new fixed point is given by @xmath93 which tends to 1 as @xmath94 goes to infinity .",
    "we now proceed to show how the geometric phase associated with the bjj dynamics can be computed .",
    "in this section we derive the expression for the geometric phase for the bjj evolution using the kinematic approach developed by mukunda and simon @xcite .",
    "we first briefly outline the basic ideas .",
    "one starts with a complex hilbert space and considers a subset @xmath95 made up of _ unit _ complex vectors denoted by @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a smooth one parameter curve , consisting of a family of vectors @xmath96 , with @xmath98 . since @xmath96 are unit vectors for all values of @xmath56 , @xmath99 giving @xmath100 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath56 . under a gauge transformation defined by a real function @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 ,",
    "one finds , @xmath105 on the other hand , we have @xmath106 integrating eq .",
    "( 3.2 ) and using the above equation , we see that a gauge invariant function , @xmath107 can be constructed .",
    "next one introduces the space @xmath108 of unit rays , which is the quotient of @xmath95 with respect to the @xmath109 action @xmath110 .",
    "it can then be shown that the curves @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( obtained by a gauge transformation ) in @xmath95 both project to the same curve @xmath113 in the ray space @xmath108 .",
    "thus the gauge invariance of the functional ( 3.3 ) implies that it is a functional only of the image @xmath113 of @xmath111 .",
    "this functional can be shown to be reparametrisation invariant as the integrand is linear in @xmath114 .",
    "one thus defines the geometric phase @xmath115 as the following gauge and reparametrisation invariant functional , @xmath116 =     arg(\\psi'(0),\\psi'(t ) ) - \\mbox{im } \\int_0^t dt~~(\\psi'(t),\\dot{\\psi}'(t ) ) \\eqno(3.4)\\ ] ] identifying the first term in eq .",

    "this leads to @xmath127 .",

    "it is clear from ( 3.8 ) that @xmath151 .",

    "as is obvious , the last point for @xmath144 on each of the plots , i.e. , for the maximum value @xmath309 , corresponds to the geometric phase for a cyclic evolution , when the population difference and phase - difference between the two condensates evolve in such a way as to return to their initial values after a time period @xmath310 .",
    "all the other intermediate points correspond to non - cyclic evolutions .",
    "as should be clear , @xmath144 for other parameters @xmath65 and @xmath57 can also be computed by following our method , case by case .",
    "this would enable one to study the variation of @xmath144 with trap parameters , which would be useful in designing appropriate experiments to measure it .",
    "the possibility of another type of experiment to study tunneling between condensates has been proposed by williams _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "this hinges on the fact that it has become possible to confine a two - component bose condensate in the same trap , as follows .",
    "@xcite first trapped and cooled @xmath311 atoms in a magnetic trap in the @xmath312 hyperfine state . after condensation",
    ", it is possible to populate the @xmath313 hyperfine state through a two - photon transition . in the presence of a weak magnetic field , these states are separated in energy by @xmath314 ( say ) .",
    "thus two different hyperfine states can exist in the trap .",
    "a weak two - photon driving pulse is applied which couples the two states and consequently , atoms can get transferred ( or `` tunnel '' ) between the two condensates . in this model",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that in the mean field approximation , one obtains coupled equations for @xmath307 and @xmath249 almost identical in form to eqs .",
    "( 2.8 ) , but with @xmath83 ( i.e. , non - interacting ) with the other parameters appropriately defined for the model , and hence all our results for the geometric phase are applicable here as well .",
    "recently , fuentes - guirdi _ et al _ @xcite have proposed a method for generating a geometric phase in a coupled two - mode bose einstein condensate , starting with a hamiltonian for two condensates existing in _ different _ hyperfine states .",
    "in addition to the experiments of hall mentioned above , condensates of @xmath315 atoms in hyperfine states @xmath316 and @xmath317 have been produced experimentally@xcite .",
    "likewise , condensates of @xmath318 atoms with @xmath316 and @xmath319 have also been created@xcite . using the schwinger angular momentum representation ,",

    "( 6.1 ) , @xmath327 , @xmath328 being the detuning frequency of the laser which couples the two hyperfine states .",
    "further , @xmath329 and @xmath330 is the strength of the laser - induced drive term that couples the two levels .",
    "interestingly , if we write the components of @xmath324 in the form @xmath331 in eq .",
    "( 6.1 ) , then on setting @xmath332 , @xmath333 becomes identical to our hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) , on identifying @xmath334 , @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "conversely , if an external driving field phase @xmath337 is subtracted from @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) , we would essentially obtain eq .",
    "thus our results for the geometric phase will be valid for that case too , with the appropriate parameters substituted .",
    "however , we point out that in the setting of @xcite , one varies the bjj system parameters @xmath338 and @xmath339 adiabatically to produce a closed circuit in parameter space , i.e .",
    ", one considers an adiabatic , cyclic evolution in parameter space , with an associated geometric phase .",
    "in contrast , in our setting , we have fixed system parameters , for which we obtain the geometric phase for both cyclic and noncyclic ( and nonadiabatic ) evolutions on the unit sphere , i.e. , in `` spin '' space . in other words , as the population difference and phase difference between the two hyperfine states evolve in time , the system follows a path in this projective space , and as we have shown , an associated geometric phase can be defined .",
    "experimental techniques to produce two condensates in close proximity has been suggested recently by chikkatur _",
    "et al_@xcite in the context of a technique to produce a continuous source of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "it would be interesting to study the tunneling between the condensates in such a set up if feasible , i.e. , investigate the evolution of population differences and phase differences , to find the associated geometric phase .",
    "geometric phases have been recently shown to have relevance in the implementation of fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite , and in the creation of vortices in a condensate @xcite .",
