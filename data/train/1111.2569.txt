    "<S> using density functional theory and many - body perturbation theory within a gw approximation , we calculate the electronic structure of a metal - molecule interface consisting of benzene diamine ( bda ) adsorbed on au(111 ) . through direct comparison with photoemission data , </S>",
    "<S> we show that a conventional g@xmath0w@xmath0 approach can underestimate the energy of the adsorbed molecular resonance relative to the au fermi level by up to 0.8 ev . the source of this discrepancy is twofold : a 0.7 ev underestimate of the gas phase ionization energy ( ie ) , and a 0.2 ev overestimate of the au work function . </S>",
    "<S> refinements to self - energy calculations within the gw framework that account for deviations in both the au work function and bda gas - phase ie can result in an interfacial electronic level alignment in quantitative agreement with experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> there is considerable interest in using organic materials as components in nanoscale energy conversion applications , and thus a critical need has emerged for improved knowledge and control of the electronic structure of metal - molecule interfaces . in particular , understanding how molecular addition / removal energies ( ionization energy , ie ; and electron affinity , ea ) are altered at a metal contact is fundamental to molecular - scale transport  @xcite , energy conversion in organic photovoltaics  @xcite , and photo- and electrocatalytic systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding metal - molecule interface electronic structure with spectroscopic accuracy poses significant challenges to standard first - principles approaches . </S>",
    "<S> important physical factors influencing electronic level alignment include the magnitude of the interface dipole formed upon adsorption , molecular level broadening via hybridization with substrate states , and surface polarization effects on electron addition and removal energetics . </S>",
    "<S> while density functional theory ( dft ) approaches within standard local and semi - local approximations can often describe interface dipoles  @xcite , hybridization , and work functions with good accuracy , prior studies  @xcite have established that the impact of substrate polarization , a non - local correlation effect , is absent from mean - field kohn - sham states . </S>",
    "<S> self - energy corrections within the gw approximation can capture this effect , with a significant impact on gaps of adsorbed molecules ( @xmath11 ev for small aromatic molecules ) . </S>",
    "<S> gw methods can also significantly improve the ie and ea of gas - phase molecules  @xcite compared to canonical semi - local kohn - sham dft , where the energy difference between highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) energies is underestimated relative to the fundamental gap ( i.e. ie - ea ) , even for the hypothetical `` exact '' exchange - correlation potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dft frontier orbital energy differences can , however , provide accurate fundamental gaps if a judicious approximation within a generalized kohn - sham framework is used  @xcite .     electronic density of states ( dos ) of 1,4-benzenediamine ( bda ) above the au(111 ) atop site . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows geometry of the 4x4 supercell in color and periodic images in gray . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital within dft is -0.25  ev below the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> g@xmath0w@xmath0 ( this work ) differs from the experimental measurement by 0.8 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the source of this discrepancy is twofold : a 0.7 ev underestimate of the gas phase ionization energy ( ie ) , and a 0.2 ev overestimate of the au work function . </S>",
    "<S> accounting for these errors with a _ post - hoc _ correction , i.e. a rigid shift , produces a value ( gw@xmath2 ) in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> results from resonant and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( respes / ups )  @xcite and their uncertainties are indicated by the shaded regions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    previous gw calculations of energy level alignment at interfaces  @xcite suggest significant improvement over dft - gga . in this work , we calculate the energy level alignment ( @xmath3 - @xmath4 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : gw_dos ] ) at a prototype metal - molecule interface , benzenediamine ( bda ) on au(111 ) , comparing our gw calculations directly with photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we find that modest inaccuracies in the constituent gas - phase bda ie and au(111 ) work function within a standard g@xmath0w@xmath0 approach  using a plane - wave basis set and plasmon - pole models , and requiring sums over unoccupied single - particle states  are additive for the adsorbate system in this case , leading to a discrepancy with measurements for the homo resonance of up to 0.8 ev . refinements of self - energies within the gw framework that ameliorate deviations for the isolated constituents can lead to a predicted homo resonance in agreement with photoemission spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> gw calculations of metal - molecule interfaces pose several computational challenges . </S>",
    "<S> first , accurate evaluation of the fock exchange requires explicit treatment of the semicore electrons , imposing the correct nodal structure on _ d _ states but leading to higher cutoffs and a need to treat more electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , metals often require a dense k - point sampling and the relevance of plasmon pole approximations can be questionable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , for a hybrid interface comprised of a molecule ( with localized states ) and a metal ( with delocalized states ) , self - energies for the constituent systems are of very different magnitudes , and taking the kohn - sham eigenstates as the quasiparticle wavefunctions may no longer be a good approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , for level alignment between states of disparate character , we require absolute convergence , and , in this case , since au self - energy corrections converge differently than those for bda states , a large number of unoccupied states ( n@xmath5 ) , together with a good extrapolation scheme  @xcite , can be necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this is a particular challenge given the concomitant need for a large supercell .    </S>",
    "<S> our gw calculations are performed using the berkeleygw  @xcite and abinit  @xcite codes , following a well - established g@xmath0w@xmath0 approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equilibrium geometries of molecular bda in the gas - phase and physisorbed on au(111 ) are determined using dft  @xcite within the pbe  @xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . </S>",
    "<S> the molecule is flat relative to the surface , at a height of 3.5   above the topmost layer of au . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with relaxed geometries obtained using a van der waals corrected density functional  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> norm - conserving pseudopotentials [ 20 ] are used with a plane- wave basis ( 60 ry cutoff ) for structural relaxations and includes 5__s _ _ and 5__p _ _ semi - core states for au . </S>",
    "<S> the surface is modeled with a 4x4 supercell containing 4 layers of au ( roughly 9@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the thomas - fermi wavevector of gold ) , a single bda molecule ( see inset figure  [ f : gw_dos ] ) , and the equivalent of 10 layers of vacuum . the metal work function and magnitude of @xmath8 change less than 0.05 ev in dft when the depth of the slab is doubled . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical in - plane bulk lattice parameter is used for au ( a=4.18   ) . the supercell brillouin zone ( bz ) </S>",
    "<S> is sampled using a 4x4x1 * k*-grid . </S>",
    "<S> gas - phase bda is modeled using the same supercell , in the absence of au , and using a coulomb truncation .    for all calculations , </S>",
    "<S> 6 ry planewave expansion cutoff is used for the dielectric function , which , for the majority of our work , is extended to finite frequencies with a generalized plasmon pole ( gpp ) model  @xcite . doubling this cutoff and the number of unoccupied states used in constructing the response function results in negligible changes to bda gas - phase ie , @xmath90.15 ev . </S>",
    "<S> updates to _ </S>",
    "<S> g _ and _ w _ use quasiparticle energies from the previous cycle and a linear fit to a coarse sampling of self - energy corrections to high energy states ( @xmath10 6  ev above vacuum ) . </S>",
    "<S> the number of states used to construct @xmath11 was held fixed at 2048 bands . for bda - au(111 ) </S>",
    "<S> interface calculations , our sum over the unoccupied subspace includes more than 1400 conduction bands ( 30 ev above @xmath4 ) , a number which , as we show , still falls considerably short of convergence . </S>",
    "<S> gas - phase results are based on a sum of over 5100 conduction bands ( @xmath9 80  ev above vacuum ) for the coulomb - hole term . for calculations of bulk </S>",
    "<S> au , we compare with results from the godby - needs  @xcite gpp model , as well as a an explicit evaluation of @xmath12 for more than 200 frequencies up to about 100 ev  @xcite . for bulk </S>",
    "<S> au , the bz is sampled with a 14@xmath13 * k*-point grid , and 500 conduction bands is used ( @xmath9 600 ev above @xmath4 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> table  [ t : gas_phase ] summarizes our results for the ie and ea of gas - phase bda at different levels of theory . </S>",
    "<S> relative to measured photoemission , dft - gga underestimates the ie by over 3 ev , consistent with previous work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our gw calculations are a significant improvement over dft - pbe , within 0.7 ev or better of experiment ( after extrapolating the unoccupied states to infinity ) , depending on whether @xmath14 or @xmath15 is updated . </S>",
    "<S> the error relative to experiment for g@xmath16w@xmath16 is 0.5 ev , or just 7% . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , with just 1000 unoccupied states and no extrapolation , the ie is about 1 ev smaller , illustrating the slow convergence of the ie with respect to unoccupied states . </S>",
    "<S> doubling the number of unoccupied states reduces the ie by only 0.2  ev . </S>",
    "<S> use of an extrapolation scheme for this slow convergence , associated with the coloumb - hole term of the gw self - energy , is therefore crucial when comparing gw to experiment . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolations @xmath17 are determined by fitting the coulomb - hole term to the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is determined from a similar fit to the _ static _ coulomb hole screened - exchange ( cohsex ) approximation ( using the same set of convergence parameters ) . within static cohsex , </S>",
    "<S> the asymptote @xmath20 does not directly depend on @xmath21 , allowing for clean optimization of the exponent . </S>",
    "<S> encouragingly , our scheme seems consistent with results computed using a completion method recently proposed by deslippe et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .        for bulk au , we find that the gpp models of hybertsen - louie and godby - needs leave the dft - pbe bandwidth relatively unchanged , in adequate agreement with xps measurements  @xcite ( overestimate of 12% and 9% respectively ) . using a fully frequency dependent dielectric function results in a 6% overestimate relative to experiment . </S>",
    "<S> better agreement will likely require going beyond the rpa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , dft - pbe provides the best au(111 ) work function  @xcite , 5.2 ev ( within 0.05 ev of experiment  @xcite ) . with either of the gpp values used here , the au(111 ) work function is larger than experiment by 0.5 ev , and by 0.2 ev with a fully frequency dependent dielectric function . for comparison , faleev et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite report a g@xmath0w@xmath0 ( and numerical @xmath11 ) work function for al(111 ) which is 0.06 ev too _ small _ compared to experiment ( 4.18 ev vs 4.24 @xmath22  0.02 ev ) , with a self - consistent gw approach producing nearly identical values .    to identify the homo energy of the bda adsorbate , </S>",
    "<S> we project the dft kohn - sham hamiltonian , @xmath23 , of the bda - au(111 ) supercell onto the dft - pbe orbitals calculated from the isolated molecule , @xmath24 . for bda physisorbed on au(111 ) , @xmath25 @xmath9 0.9 at the @xmath26 point , indicating such a projection is spectroscopically meaningful in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we note that as the bda homo resonance is not the highest occupied state in our calculation , in general we would not expect its value to agree with ups , at least within the semi - local ks framework used here . indeed , evaluating @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain -0.25 ev , a resonance value too shallow compared to photoemission , which place the homo -1.4  @xmath22  0.1 ev below @xmath4 .    to evaluate gw self - energy corrections for the bda adsorbate homo energy , we follow the above approach and evaluate the matrix element @xmath28 . since @xmath29 is approximately diagonal in the molecular basis @xmath30 , this approach is approximately equivalent to evaluating diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the full energy - dependent self - energy matrix , diagonalizing , and projecting onto the surface states to identify the adsorbate homo resonance energy measured spectroscopically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this workaround , with its substantially - reduced computational cost , is strictly valid in a  </S>",
    "<S> weak - coupling \" limit , where both @xmath23 and @xmath29 are diagonal in the basis of gas - phase orbitals , as is the case here .    to understand the adsorbate result relative to the gas - phase , we follow previous work  @xcite and partition the self - energy correction into two contributions : the fock exchange , @xmath31 ; and the portion containing static and dynamical correlation , @xmath32 . we find that @xmath33 for the adsorbate homo differs that obtained for gas - phase bda , @xmath34 , which can be understood in terms of the non - zero overlap of the bda homo with the au wavefunctions . unlike @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 involves a difficult - to - converge sum over the unoccupied space ( as with gas - phase bda ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : correlation_convergence ] , the _ difference _ between @xmath37 of the isolated molecule and the adsorbate monolayer converges much faster , with a modest sum of 600 bands ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : correlation_convergence ] ) to 1.7 ev . as with benzene on graphite  @xcite , this response is due almost entirely to static polarization : an electrostatic image charge model ( with a calculated  @xcite image plane of 1.47   above the au surface ) predicts a value of @xmath38 ev .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 for the isolated ( dashed line ) molecule and molecular resonance ( solid line ) in the monolayer as a function of the number of conduction bands used in the evaluation of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> although the absolute value of these terms converge slowly , by @xmath40 600 their difference , @xmath41 ( inset ) , has stabilized to 1.7 ev , attributable to non - local static correlations from the metal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear behavior of @xmath42 for @xmath43 reflects the character of low energy conduction bands , which are highly system specific.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : gw_dos ] , our g@xmath0w@xmath0 corrections , in the limit of @xmath17 , lead to a bda adsorbate homo energy of -0.64 ev , a significant underestimate of the experimental value of -1.4 ev . </S>",
    "<S> given the converged self - energy corrections for the isolated molecule , the metal work function , and the change in the correlation energy upon adsorption , we can understand the disagreement between theory and experiment for the adsorbate system as originating with the underestimate of the gas - phase bda ie and the overestimate of the au(111 ) work function . if we account for the discrepancies of the _ isolated _ systems with a rigid shift ( gw@xmath2 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : gw_dos ] ) , good agreement between theory and experiment for the _ composite _ system is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate that the accuracy of energy level alignment at a metal - molecule interface with a given gw approach is limited by its ability to describe the ie of an isolated molecule and the metal work function . in a stronger - coupling limit </S>",
    "<S> , dynamical contributions to electrode polarization would become important , as has been noted before  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , classical static polarization models are less valid , and @xmath37 obtained from gw must be used . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath44 may no longer be diagonal in the basis of gas phase orbitals , necessitating full evaluation of the self - energy operator .    in conclusion , through direct comparison with photoemission spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the advantages and limitations of an existing g@xmath0w@xmath0 approach in describing the electronic structure of a molecule adsorbed to a metal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> gw improves upon pbe , particularly in its inclusion of nonlocal correlation , but is limited , at least in the approach considered here , by its ability to predict gas - phase ies and work functions . </S>",
    "<S> computationally - tractable refinements that improve accuracy of these quantities will result in better quantitative agreement for level alignment . </S>"
