    "weaker absorption , consistent with its expected strength for cloud 1 in the @xmath51 absorber , would be detected over larger areas .",
    "also , starbursts are more common at @xmath191 than at the present .",
    "these factors could combine to lead to a significant covering factor of ( and therefore ) absorption from starburst winds at the redshift of the @xmath51 absorber .",
    "the model gives neutral hydrogen column densities of the absorber that suggest a sub - dla or dla environment , with @xmath192  .",
    "although h@xmath187 is frequently detected in higher redshift systems , the molecular hydrogen fraction is only @xmath193 in @xmath194 of the high - z dlas surveyed by @xcite , and does not rise above @xmath195 for sub - dlas and dlas .",
    "@xcite perform simulations of high - z dlas , and find that the area of a region that would produce dla absorption that contains molecules is a very small fraction of its overall area .",
    "they note that in high ultraviolet background , the molecular fraction can be @xmath196 , which is large enough to fuel star formation .",
    "small , dense ( @xmath197 ) , cold ( @xmath3k ) absorbers , with significant molecular fractions , like the @xmath51 absorber toward he0001 - 2340 , may occur over a small fraction of structures that give rise to sub - dlas and dlas , but are rarely intersected by qsos due to their relatively smaller area .",
    "while extremely high molecular hydrogen fractions seem to be rare in sub - dlas and dlas , up to @xmath198 of total hydrogen mass was found to be molecular in a survey of @xcite , which examined co emission from 18 nearby galaxies . in these detections",
    ", the h@xmath187 mass can be as high as 0.1 times the stellar mass .",
    "the ratio of co @xmath199 intensity to co @xmath200 intensity suggests that the emitting gas is optically thick with an excitation temperature of @xmath201k .",
    "although the exponential scale lengths of the survey targets range only from 0.8 - 3.2 kpc , they note that with increased sensitivity , objects at larger distances could be detected .",
    "similar high resolution co observations of structures likely belonging to the milky way by @xcite show fractalized clumpuscules at high galactic latitudes , with sizes of @xmath164 au , masses @xmath202 , @xmath203h@xmath204 , and column densities of @xmath205 ; he notes that such small structure would not be visible in the inner galaxy , due to overcrowding in normal molecular gas .",
    "a previous study of high galactic latitude molecular clouds via stellar absorption lines by @xcite likewise found high molecular hydrogen fractions , high densities , and small sizes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest such small structures may make up a significant percentage of halo matter , and propose that such structures may account for a fraction of missing baryonic dark matter .",
    "these structures are believed to be formed by jeans unstable and isothermal clouds , which fragment into smaller cloudlets .",
    "an alternative to this fractalized ism model is explored through simulations by @xcite .",
    "they study h@xmath187 formation in turbulent gas , predicting that h@xmath187 should rapidly form in any dense turbulent atomic cloud ( within 0.05 myr ) , regardless of whether or not the cloud is gravitationally bound or whether it is magnetic subcritical or supercritical ; up to @xmath206 of the initial atomic hydrogen may be converted to h@xmath187 in this process .",
    "they find that regions of low density ( @xmath207 ) contain more h@xmath187 than expected in gas in photodissociation equilibrium due to turbulent transport of h@xmath187 from higher density ( @xmath208 ) areas .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite of the blowout of starburst - driven superbubbles from the molecular disk of ulirgs also show similar small - scale clumps .",
    "thin dense shells are created as the bubbles sweep up dense disk gas ; rayleigh - taylor instabilities then cause these shells to fragment .",
    "clumpiness is seen down to the limits of the simulation resolution of 0.1 pc .",
    "these clumps contain high mass , and have @xmath209  .    as small molecular structures have been observed both in the galactic neighborhood ( on the order of hundreds of au),and in hydrodynamic simulations ( to the limit of their resolutions ) one would expect there to exist such structures beyond the local universe , at higher redshifts . because these structures are far too small to detect via imaging of extragalactic environments , absorption lines serve as the only probe of small - scale structure of distant galaxies .",
    "the @xmath51 absorber may be a first glimpse of such a cold , dense cloud at an earlier epoch .",
    "cloud 1 , with @xmath210(/)@xmath211 , is an extreme case of an iron - rich absorber .",
    "iron - rich systems discussed in @xcite were generally found to have high metallicities ( @xmath212 ) , @xmath213 ( @xmath214  ) , and small sizes ( @xmath77()+@xmath77()@xmath215  , @xmath216  pc ) .",
    "solar abundances , and not @xmath217-enhancement , are needed to explain their similar and column densities , which implies type ia event - enrichment of the gas @xcite .",
    "type ia enrichment requires a @xmath137 billion year delay from the onset of star formation before the elements produced enter the interstellar medium , which could be consistent with gas trapped in potential wells of dwarf galaxies , or with intergalactic star - forming structures in the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "rapid condensation of turbulent gas from a supernova could explain the small size , high molecular content , and high iron abundance observed in cloud 1 .",
    "weak absorption systems are not often found within 30 kpc of luminous star - forming galaxies , with @xmath218 @xcite ; the astrophysical origins of such systems have not been identified , although they may include extragalactic high velocity clouds @xcite , dwarf galaxies @xcite , material expelled by superwinds in dwarf galaxies @xcite , and/or massive starburst galaxies and metal - enriched gas in intergalactic star clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath219 ) , weak clouds may have been ejected from starburst supernova - driven winds during an intermediate phase of free expansion , prior to achieving equilibrium with the igm .",
    "supernova - driven winds are believed to have a multi - phase structure , with a cold component ( @xmath220k ) detected in @xcite . a warm neutral phase ( @xmath221k )",
    "may surround this component @xcite .",
    "this gas will likely fragment through hydrodynamical instabilities as it moves through the halo of the galaxy , and would appear initially as weak absorption , and later as weak absorption associated with lines in the forest @xcite .    to account for the differing",
    "/ observed in the different clouds of the same system , it seems necessary to propose different stellar populations in the vicinity of the absorbing structure .",
    "cloud 1 , due to its iron - rich nature , must be enhanced by a type ia supernova , implying the gas does not originate from a very young stellar population .",
    "the density and temperature of this gas , comparable to that of milky way molecular clouds , suggests that it is a potential site of star formation .",
    "cloud 2 , in contrast , is likely a remnant of a supernova from a massive star recently formed in its vicinity , or in a superwind driven by a collection of massive stars , as suggested by its @xmath162-enhancement .",
    "it is not surprising that we would see a mix of different processes and stellar populations in an absorption line system .",
    "some combination of dwarf galaxies , high velocity clouds , superwind and supernova shell fragments , and tidal debris could give rise to such variety .",
    "in such a scenario , clouds like cloud 2 would commonly be grouped together into systems , sometimes with fe - rich clouds , but something as extreme as cloud 1 would be rare .",
    "although detections are extremely rare in extragalactic absorbers , photoionization models of cloud 1 suggest that its small size ( @xmath222pc ) may cause many such absorbers to go undetected ; we estimate that two percent of the areas of @xmath191 halos ( 24 - 49  kpc in radius ) should be covered by such objects . with cold temperatures ( @xmath3k ) , high densities ( @xmath223 ) , and a large molecular hydrogen fraction ( @xmath224 ) , the properties of cloud 1 are similar to the dense , small milky way clouds at high galactic latitudes observed in co by @xcite and @xcite , suggesting that pockets of gas like cloud 1 may be analogs of these milky way clouds in the halos of other galaxies .",
    "small scale clumps , with sizes of hundreds of au , are predicted to exist both as part of the fractalized ism in the halos of galaxies @xcite and as condensates in turbulent gas @xcite .",
    "a type - ia supernova may have been responsible for both the turbulence and observed iron abundance in cloud 1 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath162-enhancement observed in cloud 2 , with its low - fe content , is suggestive of an origin in a type ii supernova - driven superwind .",
    "multiple - cloud weak absorption line systems are generally thought to originate in lines of sight that pass through more than one dwarf galaxies , through sparse regions of luminous galaxies at high impact parameters , or in gas - poor galaxies . in this case",
    ", one of the four components happens to be a relatively rare type of cold and dense weak absorber .    via imaging of the he0001 - 2340 field",
    "it may be possible to further constrain the absorption origin , perhaps by identifying a host galaxy or galaxies , or by finding a nearby galaxy whose environment is being sampled by these absorbers .",
    "it is also of interest to find another similar cloud , by searching large numbers of high-@xmath225 , high - resolution quasar spectra .",
    "perhaps in another case , the sightline would be clear enough to allow access to the lyman series lines , so that its metallicity could be directly measured , or to higher ionization absorption lines so that any surrounding , lower density gas phases could be identified .",
