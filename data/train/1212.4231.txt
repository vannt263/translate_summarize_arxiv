    "one of the curious thing about the galactic as well as extra galactic black hole candidates is that , they show moderate to strong jets . since black holes are compact and do not have hard surfaces , outflows and jets can originate only from the accreting material . and",
    "observations have indeed showed that the persistent jet or outflow activities are correlated with the hard spectral states of the disc when the power radiated maximizes in the hard non - thermal part of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "moreover , there seems to be enough evidence that these jets are produced within 100 schwarzschild radius of the central object @xcite .",
    "so accretion disc models which are to be considered for persistent jet generation should allow the formation of jet close to the central object , and that the spectra of the disc should be in the hard state .",
    "one of the most widely used accretion disc model  the keplerian disc @xcite , is very successful in explaining the multicoloured black body part of the spectrum .",
    "however , the presence of keplerian disc alone is inadequate in explaining the existence of the non - thermal tail of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the advection term in the equation of motion is poorly handled in this model , where the inner disc was chopped off adhoc , and can not automatically explain jet generation mechanism , neither can it explain the relative small size of the jet base .",
    "hence , one has to consider accretion models which have significant advection .",
    "an elegant summary of all types of viscous accretion disc model has been provided by @xcite . for the sake of completeness , we present a very brief account of advective discs , in the following .",
    "accretion onto black hole is necessarily transonic since radial velocity can only be small far away from the black hole , but matter must cross the horizon with velocity equal to the speed of light ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "hence accretion solutions around black holes should consider the advection term self consistently .",
    "accretion solution like bondi flow or , radial flow @xcite although satisfies the transonicity criteria , but is of very low luminosity .",
    "therefore , there was a need to consider rotating flow which are transonic too , such that the infall timescale would be long enough to generate the photons observed from microquasars and agns .",
    "the accretion model with advection which got wide attention , was adaf @xcite . initially adaf was constructed around a newtonian gravitational potential , where the viscously dissipated energy is advected along with the mass , and the momentum of the flow .",
    "the original adaf solution was self - similar and wholly subsonic , thus violating the inner boundary condition around a black hole .",
    "this inadequacy was restored when global solutions of adaf in presence of strong gravity showed that the flow actually becomes transonic at around few schwarzschild radii ( @xmath6 ) , while remains subsonic elsewhere .",
    "the self - similarity of such a solution may be maintained far away from the sonic point @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bernoulli parameter is positive making the solutions unbound .",
    "this prompted the introduction of self - similar outflows in the adaf abbreviated as adios , which would carry away mass , momentum and energy @xcite .",
    "although this is an interesting addition to the generalization of adaf type solutions , no physical mechanism was identified except the positivity of bernoulli parameter of the accretion flow , that would drive these outflows .",
    "simultaneous to the research on adaf class of solutions , a lot of progress was being made in the research of general advective , rotating solutions . for rotating advective flow",
    ", @xcite showed that with the increase in angular momentum of the inviscid flow , the number of physical critical points increases from one to two , and later it was shown that a standing shock can exist in between the two critical points @xcite . since the accretion shock is centrifugal pressure mediated , there was apprehension about the stability and formation of such shocks , in presence of processes such as viscosity , which transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "all doubts about the stability of such shocks in presence of viscosity was subsequently removed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite conjectured about the existence of multiple shocks and later , independent numerical simulations serendipitously found the existence of transient multiple shocks in presence of shakura sunyaev type viscosity @xcite .",
    "although , both general advective and adaf solutions start with the same set of equations , it was intriguing that there can be two mutually exclusive class of solutions , and without any knowledge under which condition these solutions may arise .",
    "@xcite later showed that the global adaf solution is a subset of general advective solutions .",
    "in other words , the models which concentrate only on the regime where the gravitational energy is converted mainly to the thermal and rotational energy , may either be cooling dominated ( keplerian disc ; shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; novikov & thorne , 1973 ) or advection dominated @xcite .",
    "either way , these models remain mainly subsonic ( except very close to the black hole ) and hence do not show shock transition .",
    "however , if the entire parameter space is searched , one can retrieve solutions which have enough kinetic energy to become transonic at distances of few @xmath7 .",
    "a subset amongst these solutions admit shock transitions when shock conditions are satisfied .",
    "this is the physical reason why some disk models show shock transitions and others do not @xcite . whether a flow will follow an adaf solution or",
    "some kind of hybrid solution with or without shock will depend on the outer boundary condition and the physical processes dominant in the disc .",
    "the shock model was later used to explain observations .",
    "@xcite showed that the post - shock region being hotter , can produce the hard power - law tail by inverse - comptonizing soft photons from pre - shock and post - shock parts of the accretion disc .",
    "the soft state and hard states are automatically explained depending on the existence or non - existence of the shock .",
    "presence of such transonic advective flow has also been suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "infact the ` hardness - intensity - diagram ' , or hid a hysteresis like behaviour seen in microquasars has been reproduced by this model @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the post - shock region is the elusive compton cloud .",
    "interestingly enough , the shock fronts are stable in a limited region of energy - angular momentum parameter space and naturally give rise to time dependent solutions whenever the exact momentum balance across the shock front is not achieved .",
    "this might be due to different rates of cooling @xcite , or different rates of viscous transport @xcite .",
    "these oscillations were also confirmed by pure general relativistic simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that if the post - shock region oscillates , then the hard radiation produced by the post - shock region would oscillate as well , and hence explain the qpo .",
    "infact , the evolution of qpo frequencies during the outburst states of various microquasars like xtej1550 - 654 , gro 1655 - 40 etc were explained by this model @xcite by assuming inward drift of the oscillating shock due to increased viscosity of the flow .",
    "another interesting consequence of accretion shock is that , it automatically explains the formation of outflows .",
    "the unbalanced pressure gradient force in the axial direction drives matter in the form of outflows and may be considered as the precursor of jets @xcite .",
    "these outflows can be accelerated by various accelerating mechanisms to relativistic terminal speeds @xcite .",
    "if the shock conditions are properly considered , then the mass outflow should reduce the pressure of the post - shock region and hence the shock would move inward , which in turn , would modify the shock parameter space in presence of massloss @xcite .",
    "another model of non - fluid bipolar outflows have been enthusiastically pursued by becker and his collaborators which involves fermi acceleration of particles in isothermal shocks @xcite .",
    "the advantage of shock in accretion model is that the presence or absence of shock , is good enough to broadly explain many varied aspects of black holes candidates such as spectral states , qpos , jets and outflows etc and the correlation between these aspects @xcite . such correlations are also reported in observations @xcite .",
    "there are other jet generation models too .",
    "apart from adios , magnetically driven outflows were also proposed by many authors @xcite .",
    "these magnetic bipolar outflows may be powered by the extraction of rotation energy of the black hole in the form of poynting flux .",
    "however , recent observations finds weak or no correlation of black hole spin with the jet formation around microquasars and are conjectured to be similar for agns as well @xcite .",
    "bipolar outflows may even be powered by centrifugal or magnetic effect , and has been shown that for low angular momentum even weak magnetic fields can produce equatorial inflow , bipolar outflow , polar funnel inflow and polar funnel outflow , and magnetic effect was identified as the main driver of such outflows .",
    "interesting as it may be , however , its connection with spectral and radiative state of black hole candidates is not well explored .",
    "it is well known that the spectra of the black hole candidates extends to high energy domain ( @xmath8 few mevs ) , and one of the ways to generate such high energy non - thermal spectra is by shock acceleration of electrons , and has been used to explain spectra from black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "not only hydrodynamic calculations , even magneto - hydrodynamic investigations bears the possibility of shock in accretion @xcite",
    ". therefore we are looking for solutions of outflow generation which incorporates shocks , although presently investigating the effect of viscosity in formation of such outflows .    various simulations with pacznski - wiita potential @xcite , as well as grmhd simulations @xcite showed the presence of post - shock bipolar outflows , which are far from isothermal approximation .",
    "therefore , presently we relax the strict isothermality condition , and concentrate on conservation of fluxes across the shock front .",
    "theoretical frame work of thermally driven outflows has been done either for inviscid discs @xcite , or for viscous discs where the viscous stress was assumed to be proportional to the total pressure @xcite .",
    "no theoretical investigations has thus far been made to study thermally driven outflows from discs where the viscous stress is proportional to the shear , a form of viscosity which is probably more realistic for black hole system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we solve viscous accretion disc equations for the contentious viscosity prescription , to compute the solution topologies of thermally driven outflows and the mass - outflow rates .",
    "we compute the energy angular - momentum parameter space for the accretion flows which will produce such outflows , and its dependence on viscosity parameter . in numerical simulation with shakura & sunyaev viscosity prescription",
    ", shock location seems to increase with the increase of viscosity parameter @xcite , while theoretical investigations with chakrabarti - molteni viscosity prescription showed the opposite phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we address this issue and attempt to remove any ambiguity . since the post - shock disc could well be the elusive compton cloud , while the shakura - sunyaev viscosity might be more physical since it satisfies proper inner boundary conditions around black holes @xcite , studies of shock driven outflows and its dependence on viscosity would throw light in understanding the radio x - ray correlation from x - ray binaries , especially , whether the jet becomes stronger or weaker with the increasing viscosity parameter , this would have an interesting connotation in interpreting observations .",
    "since the post - shock disc can produce high energy photons , then some part of the thermal energy gained through shocks will be dissipated as radiations .",
    "we study the issue of origin of such outflows in presence of dissipative shocks too .    in the next section",
    ", we present the simplifying assumptions and equations of motion . in section 3",
    ", we present the methodology of solution . in section 4 , we present the solutions , and in the last section we present discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "it has recently been stressed that black hole rotation plays no , or little part in generating or powering these jets @xcite .",
    "so it is expected that plasma processes or fluid properties of the disc would generate jets . in this paper",
    ", we consider a non - rotating black hole and focus only on the fluid properties of accretion disc , which may be considered to be responsible for jet generation .",
    "we have assumed the axis - symmetric disc - jet system to be in steady state .",
    "the space - time properties around a schwarzschild black hole is described by the pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by @xcite .",
    "the viscosity prescription in the disc is described by the shakura - sunyaev prescription .",
    "we ignore any cooling mechanism in order to focus on the effect of viscosity .",
    "the jets are tenuous and should have less differential rotation than the accretion disc , as a result the viscosity in jets can be ignored . to negate any resulting torque ,",
    "the angular momentum at the jet base is assumed same as that of the local value of angular momentum of the disc .",
    "the accretion disc occupies the space on or about the equatorial plane .",
    "but the jet flow geometry is described about the axis of symmetry .",
    "we first present the equations of motions of the accretion disc and the jet separately in the subsequent part of this section , and then in the next section , we describe the method to obtain the self consistent accretion - ejection solution . in this paper",
    "we have used the geometric unit system where , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath11 is the gravitational constant ) .",

    "one has to have a certain non - zero viscosity to even have a global ( that connects horizon and outer edge ) solution .",
    "infact , for this particular case we have identified a limiting viscosity parameter @xmath202 , such that advective global solutions are possible for any viscosity parameter @xmath203 . and",

    "so one needs higher @xmath204 to reduce the angular momentum to the extent that may produce standing accretion shock . and if @xmath4 is increased beyond another critical value @xmath205 , steady shock is not found .",
    "hence one can identify three critical @xmath4 s for accretion flows starting with the same outer boundary condition , where the angular momentum at the outer boundary is local keplerian value .",
    "interestingly , @xmath4 prescription originally invoked to generate keplerian disc @xcite , can produce sub - keplerian accretion flow with or without shock even if angular momentum is keplerian at the outer boundary .",
    "this is not surprising since , the gravitational energy released by the infalling matter , would be converted to kinetic energy and thermal energy ( by compression and viscous dissipation ) . if the gravitational energy is converted to thermal energy and only the rotation part of kinetic energy , and also if the thermal energy gained by viscous dissipation is efficiently radiated away , then one would produce keplerian disc solutions .",

    "the radiative processes have been ignored which produces hot flow , but the advection terms have not been ignored .",
    "therefore , sub - keplerian flow with significant advection are obtained .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 on shock location @xmath158 is an interesting issue .",
    "numerical simulations show that , for fixed outer boundary condition , @xmath158 expands to larger distances with the increase of @xmath4 @xcite , while analytically @xcite showed that for the same outer boundary condition , @xmath158 shifts closer to the horizon with the increase in @xmath4 .",
    "although , the viscosity prescription of @xcite and the simulations are different , namely the former chose the stress to be proportional to total pressure , while in simulations the stress is proportional to the shear , still viscosity reduces angular momentum , and we know for lower angular momentum if the shock forms , it should form closer to the black hole ! since the viscosity prescription in this paper is similar to the simulations , we should be able to answer the dichotomy .",
    "so a concrete question may arise , if viscosity is increased , does the @xmath158 expands to larger distances or , contracts to a position closer to the horizon ? if the viscosity acts in a way such that the @xmath208 ( immediate post - shock @xmath23 ) is less than its inviscid value at the shock then @xmath158 will move closer to the horizon",
    ". however , such simple minded reasoning may fail , if shocks exists , then the post shock flow being hotter would transport more efficiently than the immediate pre - shock flow .",
    "so although , @xmath209 , it is not necessary @xmath208 will be less than @xmath210 .",
    "we scourged the parameter space to find the answer , and in the following we present the explanation .",
    "let @xmath211 be the distance at which the @xmath23 distribution of the viscous solution is coincident with the @xmath23 value of the inviscid solution , let us further assign @xmath212 .",
    "it is to be remembered that @xmath213 for the inviscid ( @xmath42 ) solution , but @xmath214 for viscous solution because viscosity reduces the angular momentum . in all the simulations done on viscous flow in the advective regime referred in this paper ,",
    "one starts with an inviscid solution ( since analytical solutions are readily available ) , and then the viscosity is turned on , keeping the values at the outer boundary fixed . in other words , it is this @xmath211 that is called the outer boundary in numerical simulations , and generally , @xmath215 since it is computationally expensive to simulate a large domain from just outside the horizon to few@xmath216 and still retain required resolution to achieve intricate structures in the accretion disc . in figs .",

    "the vertical solid line is the location of the shock for the inviscid flow .",
    "although , we match the @xmath224 at @xmath211 of the viscous and inviscid solutions , we still integrate outwards upto @xmath225 .",

    "increase in @xmath262 would drive more matter into the outflow channel .",
    "therefore , the decrease in @xmath264 is dominated by the increase in @xmath262 , and so @xmath157 increases with @xmath4 for a fixed outer boundary condition",
    ".    however , @xmath157 decreases with the increase in @xmath125 , which also shows that these jets are thermally driven . in fig .",
    "[ lab : fig11]d , @xmath157 is plotted with @xmath125 for @xmath42 ( solid ) , @xmath289 ( dotted ) and @xmath193 ( dashed ) . the fixed parameters are @xmath286 and @xmath234 .",
    "it was also found out that there are critical @xmath125 beyond which no standing shock conditions are satisfied , and they are @xmath290 for @xmath42 ( solid ) , @xmath291 for @xmath256 ( dotted ) and @xmath292 for @xmath293 ( dashed ) .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath294 increases with the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath157 is the fraction of matter which is shock heated and ejected out as bipolar outflows . to properly understand the role of shock in driving bipolar outflow , we consider accretion solutions with the same outer boundary condition , or the case presented in fig . [ lab : fig11]c . in fig .",
    "[ lab : fig12]a , we plot various quantities across the shock , @xmath157 ( solid ) , @xmath262 ( dotted ) , @xmath158 ( dashed ) , and @xmath264 ( long dashed ) , as a function of @xmath4 , and for @xmath269 , corresponding to the solid plot of fig . [ lab : fig11]c . in fig .",
    "[ lab : fig12]b , we plot @xmath157 ( solid ) , @xmath262 ( dotted ) , @xmath158 ( dashed ) , and @xmath264 ( long dashed ) , as a function of @xmath4 , and for @xmath270 , corresponding to the dashed plot of fig .",
    "[ lab : fig11]c .",
    "increasing @xmath4 in accretion with the same outer boundary condition , will decrease @xmath208 and therefore decrease @xmath158 ( dashed ) .",
    "decrease in @xmath158 implies that the shock is formed closer to the black hole , where the viscous dissipation would be more @xmath262 will be higher ( dotted ) .",
    "the jet velocity is small at the jet base , so large @xmath262 means hotter flow and stronger driving of the outflow higher @xmath157 .",
    "figure [ lab : fig12]b shows that , as the shock dissipation @xmath125 is increased , at certain @xmath4 , @xmath262 is reduced while the decrease in @xmath264 is marginal , this causes @xmath157 initially to decrease with @xmath4 , but eventually starts to increase as @xmath165 increases appreciably .    in fig .",
    "[ lab : fig13]a , we plot the @xmath167 shock parameter space for flows with @xmath295 ( solid ) , @xmath296 ( dotted ) , @xmath297 ( dashed ) , and @xmath298 ( long dashed ) . the viscosity parameter for this figure is @xmath256 .",
    "it is to be remembered @xmath299 means no massloss and @xmath300 means presence of bipolar outflows .",
    "therefore @xmath295 ( solid ) , implies the shock parameter space for rh shocks with no massloss and no dissipation at the shock , while @xmath296 ( dotted ) implies non dissipative shock but massloss is present .",
    "similarly , @xmath297 ( dashed ) and @xmath301 ( long dashed ) shock parameter space for dissipative shocks of various strength and in presence of massloss .",

    "we know from fig .",
    "[ lab : sokparam_fig ] , that with the increase of @xmath4 the shock parameter space shrinks , however , in presence of massloss , flows with low @xmath105 seems to show no standing shock . in fig .",
    "[ lab : fig13]b , we see that although the parameter space for shock shrinks but low @xmath105 flow again exhibit standing shock , which signifies that the mass outflow rate decreases with the increase of @xmath125 .",
    "quasars and micro - quasars may show strong jets , and these outflows are correlated with the spectral state of the object .",
    "therefore , quantitative estimate of the generation of these outflows are required , especially , the relation between the mass outflow rates and the viscosity parameter needs to be ascertained , this is because the viscosity will determine the disc spectral states .",
    "most of these estimates are available for inviscid flow , or special viscosity prescription or shock condition , but not for the most general shock condition , partially dissipative shock .    in this paper ,",
    "our main concern has been to estimate the thermally driven bipolar outflows from shocked accretion discs around black holes . since accretion disc should posses some amount of viscosity , a proper understanding of viscous accretion disc is required .",
    "as outflows are generated from the post - shock disc and high energy photons should also emerge from the post - shock disc , an investigation of estimating the outflow rate and correlating it with the dissipation parameters is a must requirement . in order to estimate the outflows correctly , a proper understanding of the accretion process has to be undertaken , and we presented all possible accretion solutions without massloss in section 4.1 , including the shocked and shock free accretion solutions and the dependence of these solutions on viscosity parameter .",
    "while doing so we have compared solutions with same inner and outer boundary conditions , and have shown that these differences produces a significant difference in interpreting the results .    for solutions with the same inner boundary conditions ( figs .",
    "[ lab : eov_fig]a - p ) , we found two critical viscosity parameters , the first one being the onset of shock ( @xmath182 ) , and the other being the one above which standing shock disappears ( @xmath183 ) and generates a shock free global solution which is wholly subsonic except close to the horizon , or the adaf type solution . simultaneous existence of both @xmath182 and @xmath183 will depend on whether @xmath153 is small enough to produce a corresponding o - type inviscid solution . if inviscid solution is already shocked then only @xmath183 will exist , while if the inviscid solution is i or w type then neither @xmath182 nor @xmath183 exists . for solutions with the same outer boundary condition , flow starting with same @xmath105 , @xmath302 at some injection radius @xmath303 , fig .",
    "[ lab : adsh_fig]a - e , there would be an additional critical viscosity parameter @xmath304 , which would allow a global solution connecting the horizon and the outer boundary @xmath303 .",
    "we have also confirmed that fluids in such cases , @xmath158 would decrease with the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath158 with the increase of @xmath4 is interesting .",
    "@xcite for the first time argued that the post - shock disc is the elusive compton cloud , which inverse - comptonizes the pre - shock soft photons to produce power law tail .",
    "if the shock remains strong then we have the canonical hard state and when the shock becomes weak or disappear we have the canonical soft state .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that if the shock oscillates , it does with a frequency @xmath305 , where @xmath306 . if the shock oscillates then the hard radiation from it would oscillate with the same frequency and could explain the mhz to few tens of hz qpo observed in stellar mass black hole candidates .",
    "outburst phase in microquasars starts with low frequency qpos in hard state , but as the source moves to intermediate states the qpo frequency increases to a maximum and then goes down in the declining phase , a fact well explained by approaching oscillating @xmath158 with the increase of viscosity @xcite .",
    "our steady state model also shows that if every other conditions at the outer boundary is same , then @xmath158 decreases with the increase of @xmath4 , so we expect with the increase of viscosity the shock oscillation too will increase , and therefore the shock oscillation model of qpo seems to follow observations .",
    "we have computed the mass outflow rate from both non - dissipative as well as dissipative shocks .",
    "the mass outflow rate is always of higher entropy than the pre - shock disc , which shows that mass - outflow rate is a natural consequence of a shocked accretion disc , a fact readily supported by various multi - dimensional simulations . in this connection",
    "we would like to comment that unlike @xcite , we have corrected the jet cross sectional area with the projection effect onto the jet streamline .",
    "we showed that @xmath157 generally decreases with @xmath125 .",
    "we also showed that the parameter space is significantly modified due to the presence of massloss and dissipation at the shock .",
    "when dissipative shocks are included we do see that the relative mass outflow rate decreases which are also to be expected .",
    "increasing dissipation would make the shocks weaker , which can be identified with the softer spectral state , and the accretion disc in the soft state will give weaker or not outflow @xcite .",
    "comparison of steady shock parameter space figs .",
    "( [ lab : sokparam_fig],[lab : fig9 ] ) , suggests that massloss may trigger an instability .",
    "it shows that parts of parameter space which produced steady shocks in absence of of massloss , do not show steady shocks in presence of massloss .",
    "this is because the post - shock pressure gets reduced as it looses mass , and the shock moves closer to the black hole ( fig .",
    "[ lab : fig7 ] ) to regain the momentum balance .",
    "however , this is not always possible , and the shock may oscillate or get disrupted altogether , therefore , there should be a massloss induced instability as well .",
    "we have also shown that the main driver for the bipolar outflow is the energy gained through shock .",
    "interestingly , the mass outflow rate generally increase with the increasing viscosity parameter .",
    "since the the shock location also decreases with the increasing @xmath4 for identical outer boundary condition , there is a possibility that the qpos and mass outflow rates be correlated  an issue we will pursue in fully time dependent studies .    it is interesting to note that the dissipation parameter used in this work has been assumed constant , however this would actually depend on accretion rates and the size of the post - shock region .",
    "as the accretion rate changes the total photons generated would change , and similarly as @xmath158 changes the fraction of photons intercepted by post - shock disc as well as its optical depth would change , this would render @xmath125 variable .    it has been observationally established that steady jets are observed from black hole candidates , when the spectrum of the disc is in the hard state @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the presence of strong shock is similar to the hard state .",
    "we have shown that with the increasing @xmath4 , we get stronger jet , however evolution of jet states with spectral states is a time - dependent phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the phenomena of qpo and growth or decay of qpo are time dependent phenomenon too .",
    "our conjecture that the qpo will be correlated with the jet states can only be vindicated through a fully time dependent study , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "furthermore , since we concentrated on the effect of viscosity on accretion disc and outflows , therefore , magnetic field and other realistic cooling processes have been ignored .",
    "if cooling processes are considered then a direct comparison with the observation will be possible .",
    "as has been noted that a little bit of magnetic field will have an important effect on the dynamics of the flow @xcite , however transonicity criteria will be important too .",
    "because a magnetized flow may posses fast , slow or alfvenic waves , and the number of sonic points may increase @xcite .",
    "if magnetized flows admit shocks , then the shock produced , may be even more robust . and this hydrodynamic model might well act as the simpler version of the magneto fluid model .",
    "we are working on dynamics of magnetized flows and would be reported elsewhere .",
    "the concrete conclusions we draw from this paper is the following .",
    "viscosity is important and affects the accretion solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "shock in accretion can be obtained for fairly high viscosity parameter .",
    "shocks naturally produces outflows , and for fixed outer boundary conditions of the disc , shock location decreases but mass outflow rate generally increases .",
    "this augurs well for the model as this is exactly observed in hard to intermediate hard spectral transitions . however , in presence of dissipative shocks the mass outflow rate decreases . over all we see that @xmath157 may vary between few % to more than 10 % , although in presence of dissipative shocks",
    ", the estimate of @xmath157 is about few % .",
    "we have also computed the shock parameter space for accreting flows without mass loss and dissipation , with massloss but no dissipation and with massloss and dissipation and have shown that the parameter space for steady shocks shrinks with increasing dissipation .",
