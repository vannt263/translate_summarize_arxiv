    "the decomposition of @xmath2 with components in subgroups of the group of diffeomorphisms @xmath4 provide interesting dynamical or geometrical information of the stochastic system . in the literature , this kind of decomposition has been studied in several frameworks and with different aimed subgroups ; among others , see e.g. bismut @xcite , kunita @xcite , @xcite , ming liao @xcite and some of our previous works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in particular , in catuogno ,",
    "da silva and ruffino @xcite , the authors consider a pair of complementary distributions in a differentiable manifold @xmath0 , in the sense that each tangent space splits into a direct sum of two subspaces depending differentiably on @xmath0 .",
    "these subspaces are called , by convenience , horizontal and vertical distributions . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that locally , up to a stopping time @xmath1 , a stochastic flow @xmath2 in @xmath0 can be decomposed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a diffusion in the group of diffeomorphisms @xmath7 generated by horizontal vector fields , and @xmath8 is a process in the group of diffeomorphisms @xmath9 generated by vertical vector fields .",
    "the authors also present stochastic differential equations on the corresponding infinite dimensional lie subgroups for the components @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "the infinite dimensional lie group structure considered in this case is described in milnor @xcite , neeb @xcite and omori @xcite .",
    "the stopping time @xmath1 mentioned above , which restricts the time where the decomposition exists , appears due to an explosion in the equation of one of the components of the decomposition , with initial conditions at the identity .",
    "it is related to the degeneracy of the dynamics of one distribution with respect to the other .",
    "the initial motivation for this kind of decomposition comes from a system whose flow is originally energy perserving , hence trajectories lies on energy levels . after a perturbation by transverse vector fields , hence destroying this foliated behaviour , the decomposition allows to study separatly an energy preserving component and a transverse component .",
    "this is , for instance the context of an averaging principle in gargate - ruffino @xcite , where the vertical component is rescaled by @xmath11 , see also li @xcite in the hamiltonian context .",
    "flows in a principal fibre bundle with an affine connection gives another class of examples where the distributions are not necessarily integrable , hence generating holonomy . in melo ,",
    "morgado and ruffino @xcite , the same decomposition is considered for the case of stochastic flows with jumps , using marcus equation , as in kurtz , pardoux and protter @xcite .    in this article , we work with the same structure of @xcite , but assuming that the distributions are integrable : the manifold @xmath0 is endowed with two complementary foliations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , i.e. , such that the leaves of the vertical foliation @xmath13 are transverse to the leaves of the horizontal foliation @xmath12 , in the sense that @xmath14 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath15 for this space . the action of the subgroup of diffeomorphisms @xmath7 fixes each horizontal leaf and the action of @xmath9 fixes vertical leaves .",
    "the dynamics in @xmath0 is given by a stochastic flow of ( local ) diffeomorphisms @xmath2 generated by a stratonovich sde on @xmath0 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a brownian motion in @xmath19 constructed on a filtered complete probability space @xmath20 and @xmath21 are smooth vector fields in @xmath0 .",
    "in this situation , there exists a stochastic solution flow of ( local ) diffeomorphisms @xmath2 , see e.g. among others the classical kunita @xcite , elworthy @xcite . the flow is assumed to be complete , such that its explosion time is not a restriction for the decomposition .",
    "the fact that we deal with an stochastic flow of a stratonovich sde is convenient , say , to get explicit equations for the components @xmath6 and @xmath10 , and to find an it formula for subdeterminants involved in the context ( section 3.1 ) . nevertheless , here",
    ", many of our results on decomposition apply also to a continuous family @xmath22 of diffeomorphisms such that @xmath23 , which not necessarily satisfies the cocycle property ( e.g. theorem [ thm : globdec ] ) .",
    "our aim here is to study topological features on the foliations relating to this decomposition .",
    "it is particularly interesting the fact that decomposability of a flow is strongly related with the geometrical concept of transverse orientation in a pair of foliations .",
    "precisely , the influence of the topology of the foliations appears in two intertwined categories : analytical and topological aspects .",
    "the analytical approach is presented in section 1.2 .",
    "it is essentially guided by the subdeterminant of the linearised flow : it gives us a necessary and sufficient condition for the local existence of the decomposition .",
    "for the topological aspects , initially , we consider a pair of horizontal and vertical foliations , where there might be a set of points which one can not reach from a point @xmath24 in the manifold @xmath0 , by taking a concatenation of a vertical path with a horizontal path , in this order .",
    "we discuss this property of attainability and its consequences for the decomposition in section 2.1 . in section 2.2 , we study the dynamics of the stochastic flow @xmath2 in the leaves , and how this action might be a restriction for the decomposition .",
    "our main result is in section 2.3 , where we proof that , under the condition of transverse orientability of the horizontal foliation , the global decomposition exists if and only if the family of diffeomorphisms preserves this orientation .    in the last section we present an it - liouville formula for subdeterminants of the linearized stochastic flow @xmath25 . using this formula and cauchy - binet identity ( see e.g. tracy and widom @xcite ) ,",
    "we discuss a pair of sufficient condition for the existence of the decomposition of the flow @xmath2 , for @xmath3 .",

    "an analytical restriction for the local decomposition of @xmath85 appears related with the subdeterminant of the derivative of @xmath85 :    [ prop : analyt local obstruct decomp ] there exists a unique ( up to reduction in the domain ) decomposition @xmath86 in a neighbourhood of @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 moreover , if @xmath89 is continuous ( with respect to , say , @xmath90 topology ) and satisfies the determinant condition above , then @xmath6 and @xmath10 are also continuous with respect to time @xmath91 .",

    "we have the decomposition : @xmath103 clearly , the vertical leaves are not preserved .",
    "there exists an analytical obstruction when @xmath104 .",

    "we distinguish three kinds of topological aspects of the foliations related with the existence of the decomposition : the first one concerns the limitation on the attainability of trajectories starting at an initial condition and running exclusively along a vertical trajectory concatenated with a horizontal trajectory .",
    "the second aspect concerns the effect of the dynamics on the leaves . finally , the third aspect concerns transversely orientation of the horizontal foliation .",
    "our main result guarantees that if the flow preserves this orientation , then the flow is globally decomposable .      in many pairs of foliations , given a starting point @xmath24",
    "there might be a set of points which one can not reach from @xmath24 by taking a concatenation of a vertical path with a horizontal path , in this order .",
    "see e.g. figure 1 , where , say the horizontal leaves are represented by bold curves and vertical leaves are represented by thin curves in @xmath107 . for @xmath108 , the attainable points is the open set above the line @xmath109 .",
