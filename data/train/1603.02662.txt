    "the study of strongly interacting systems can be motivated by the realization that coherent quantum phenomena , such as high - temperature superconductivity , helium superfluidity , and quantum magnetism , occur in systems where the particle interactions are intrinsically strong . in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , examples are strong coulomb interactions in quantum nanowires and in nanotubes @xcite , as well as linear compounds with strong exchange interactions that provide realizations of various spin chains @xcite .",
    "to treat these 1d systems , some popular approaches include bosonization and luttinger liquid theory @xcite , the bethe ansatz @xcite , and , most recently , the density matrix renormalization group @xcite invented by steven white .",
    "it has now become possible to build setups with cold atomic gases that can provide quantum simulation of these low - dimensional quantum few- and many - body systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite consisting of strongly interacting bosons in 1d was realized in experiments @xcite .",
    "luttinger - liquid behavior in interacting bosonic systems was also observed @xcite .",
    "more recently , strongly interacting fermionic systems were realized in 1d @xcite , also in the limit of just a few particles @xcite . in the latter setup",
    "it was shown that one can experimentally access strongly interacting few - body systems in the regime where they realize a heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "these developments were a motivation for our work during the last few years which resulted in the method presented below .    before we proceed with our presentation , we overview some previous studies relevant to the present paper . in 1960",
    "girardeau @xcite demonstrated the connection between strongly interacting bosons and spin - polarized / spinless fermions .",
    "for instance , it turns out that the ground state of a bosonic system can be obtained by taking the absolute value of the corresponding fermionic wave function .",
    "this connection was subsequently generalized in various ways . in 2004 , within the context of atomic systems , girardeau and olshanii provided the so - called fermi - bose mapping strategy to describe two - component fermi and bose systems @xcite . in 2006",
    "girardeau connected these observations to exchange interactions , thus , relating the mapping to spin models @xcite . in the strongly interacting regime",
    "a formal mapping that produces eigenstates of the total spin and the spin projection along one direction was proposed not long after @xcite .",
    "note that this connection was also established within condensed - matter physics , where in 1990 ogata and shiba @xcite used the bethe ansatz solution to show how the 1d hubbard model becomes a spin model for strong interactions .",
    "the spin models that were derived have exchange coefficients that are site - independent because the starting point was usually either homogeneous 1d space or a lattice model with some discrete translation invariance .",
    "it was not until around 2013 , when scientists realized that once you deviate from the homogeneous case , the spin models and particularly their exchange coefficients should be site - dependent , as they need to reflect the geometric landscape of the confinement potential .",
    "this was initially identified as a short - coming of the fermi - bose mapping in the case of harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "it was then realized that this does not spell the end of the fermi - bose mapping and effective spin model hamiltonians @xcite , but it does mean that a different model that takes the external confinement into account should be used .",
    "this model implies that a confined @xmath3-body system has a set of distinct local exchange coefficients that are completely specified by the external potential . the first reference to provide",
    "an explicit formula for these coefficients is volosniev  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "it was also realized that the exchange coefficients do not depend on the system composition ( bosons / fermions / mixtures , two- or more internal degrees of freedom ) as long as the interactions between all species are strong and the particle masses are the same .",
    "this paper was soon followed by several other papers exploring various approximations to these coefficients @xcite and their applications @xcite .    due to the presence of confinement in the relevant experimental setups , it is crucial to be able to calculate these coefficients .",
    "this is a complicated task , because the explicit formula for the local exchange coefficients involves computationally demanding @xmath4 dimensional integrals over an antisymmetrized @xmath3-body wave function ( a slater determinant ) @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we describe a procedure for computing these coefficients that bypasses the complexity of high - dimensional integrations , and introduce associated software called conan that computes the coefficients for up to 35 particles in arbitrary external potentials .",
    "the source code to the conan program is freely available at @xcite including pre - compiled versions that run out of the box .",
    "we ask that in any scientific publication based wholly or in part on conan , the use of conan must be acknowledged and the present paper must be cited .",

    "we assume that @xmath30 corresponds to a ground state of spinless fermions .",

    "the procedure reduces the computation time as the derivatives have to be computed only once for each @xmath84 rather than computing it @xmath85 times .      here",
    "we outline our method for computing the coefficients @xmath43 from eq .",
    ", where we first take all the sums for a given @xmath60 and then perform the integration . to take the sums the following",

    "for this the product in eq .",

    "can estimate how the computation time scales with the number of particles , @xmath92 .",
    "it seems that the steps 2 , 5 , and 6 are the most demanding for large @xmath3 , because the computation time of all these steps scales roughly as @xmath93 .",
    "still , this scaling is surprisingly good .    to further reduce the computation time we have exploited the fact that modern computers have multiple computing cores . the easiest way to go about parallelizing",
    "the program is to let each core compute a separate geometric coefficient . in our implementation",
    "there is not a great overlap in computation different coefficients , therefore , this way of parallelizing leads to a much more effective use of the computing power . furthermore ,",
    "the geometric coefficients only have a use when all of them are known , so this parallelizing can not slow down the process .",
    "there is one caveat associated with the outlined procedure which we should like to bring attention to .",
    "the success of our algorithm relies on an accurate diagonalization of @xmath86 , which is composed of partial overlap integrals of the wave functions .",
    "some of these overlaps may be much smaller than the others depending on which overlap and to what value of @xmath84 it is being evaluated .",
    "therefore , the entries of @xmath69 might span many orders of magnitude , and the use of too small precision in the diagonalization of @xmath69 might yield a wrong outcome .",
    "it turned out that the usual machine precision is insufficient for @xmath94 .",
    "this is likely due to an enhanced error because the eigenvalues are taken to a high negative power in eq .  .",
    "we have found ourselves forced to implement a diagonalization routine using numbers with until several thousands bits precision ( for large @xmath92 ) in order to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors accurately .",
    "the requirement for the numerical precision to this diagonalization scales with the number of particles so this inevitably influences the original estimate of an @xmath95 computation time . in section",
    "[ sec : ex ] we will see that the computation time typically scales with @xmath96 .      the computation of @xmath53 from eq .",
    "is straightforward .",
    "it requires only the eigenstates of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath97 from eq .  , and a numerical procedure to perform the integration in eq .  .",
    "both of these requirements can be fulfilled by picking a suitable basis of states for the one - body problem .",

    "it should be noted that this increase in speed does not alter the way the computation time scales with the number of particles . simply doing the @xmath113 integrals from eq .",
    "would ideally scale as @xmath114 , but in practice increases a bit faster due to the difficulty of integrating the rapidly oscillating excited states that come into play when @xmath3 becomes large .",
    "similarly , calculating @xmath53 using eq .",
    "requires 2 matrix products involving the @xmath108-matrix .",
    "this matrix has @xmath3 rows and @xmath100 columns , and so the calculation time scales as @xmath115 . because the basis size does not need to be altered significantly as @xmath3 is increased , the scaling for this calculation is also close to @xmath114 .",
    "using the algorithm presented in the previous section we wrote a code conan , which produces @xmath43 for given @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "we start the presentation of our code by describing the conversion of the relevant quantities into unitless numbers that conan works with .",

    "a reasonable choice for the unit of length and the corresponding unit of energy is @xmath130 with these definitions , the numerical potential to feed into the program becomes @xmath131 and when the program finishes calculating the coefficients @xmath123 , these should be converted back to dimensionful quantities as @xmath132    with this example in mind , we can now approach the subject of how the program behaves when we rescale the units .",
    "assume we rescale the unit of length by a factor @xmath133 . because the unit of energy is connected to @xmath116 by eq .",
    ", this would also rescale the unit of energy .",

    "note first that besides the number of particles , the only information about the system entered into the calculations is the potential @xmath127 .",
    "in other words , if we pick a sufficiently large @xmath125 ( and specify other precision - parameters , as described in section  [ sec : guide ] ) , the coefficients should depend only on the potential , i.e. , @xmath140 \\ ; .\\ ] ] assume now that we are dealing with a potential which is a homogeneous function , that is , a function for which there exists a point @xmath141 and a real number @xmath142 , such that for any @xmath143 the following holds : @xmath144 one example of such a potential is the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath145 ) introduced in the previous section .    for potentials of this type ,",
