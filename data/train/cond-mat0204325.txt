    "the understanding of spin dephasing is of paramount interest in all fields of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) sciences . in nmr spectroscopy",
    "it determines the line shape , in nmr imaging it is  besides longitudinal relaxation  the major mechanism determining the contrast and contains morphological as well as functional information .",
    "the processes contributing to spin dephasing are related to the spin environment . in biological tissues , for example ,",
    "spin dephasing may result from dipole - dipole interaction of water proton spins with paramagnetic ions like fe@xmath0 .",
    "another cause is diffusion within inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by native or contrast agent induced susceptibility differences that are related to tissue composition and/or cellular and sub cellular compartments . in magnetic resonance imaging spin dephasing in external gradient fields is exploited to get information about diffusion within biological systems .",
    "these diffusion sensitive imaging techniques are applied to study tissue anisotropy and restrictions of diffusion that are given by membranes of cells and sub cellular structures .",
    "essential for dephasing of spins are the field fluctuations that induce the phase modulations .",
    "it is important to note that in biological tissues the relevant processes cover almost the whole range of time scales .",
    "for example , the dynamics of interactions of water proton spins with paramagnetic macromolecules as ferritin is so fast that it can be considered to be within the motional narrowing regime . on the other hand , dephasing of spins in magnetic field gradients around larger vessels is almost coherent .",
    "i.e. it is in the static dephasing regime @xcite .",
    "hence , for biological applications it is important to obtain results from theory that are valid over the whole motion regime . however , in most cases this is not possible analytically .",
    "therefore , most efforts have focused on limiting cases .",
    "the _ motional narrowing limit _ is well investigated and a number of analytical results were obtained for it@xcite .",
    "the characteristic of this limit is that the mean phase shift induced by a field realization is much smaller than one , i.e. @xmath1 , where the correlation time @xmath2 gives the mean duration of some field realization , and @xmath3 is the variance of the inhomogeneous field .",
    "the relaxation time is then obtained as @xmath4 . in the other limiting case , i.e. the _ static dephasing regime _ ( @xmath5 ) , yablonski@xcite derived analytical expressions for coherent dephasing of spins in inhomogeneous fields around magnetic centers like cylinders or spheres .",
    "kiselev @xcite extended yablonski s static dephasing approach by considering diffusion of spins within local linear gradients .",
    "however , this approach requires that the diffusion length @xmath6 during dephasing is within the linear approximation of the inhomogeneous fields @xmath7 .",
    "note that expansion around the limiting cases by perturbation approaches leads to divergences in the respective other limits .",
    "therefore , the intermediate motion regime , i.e. almost everything between the static dephasing and motional narrowing limit , was in most situations accessible by simulations only @xcite .",
    "recently , we used a strong collision ( sc ) approach to characterize spin dephasing in a particular situation : an inhomogeneous field around regularly arranged parallel cylinders filled with a paramagnetic substance @xcite , a model reflecting the capillary network of the cardiac muscle .",
    "the results agreed well with simulations @xcite over the whole dynamic range , and with experimental data @xcite .    the basic idea behind the sc approach is to replace the original generator of the markov process by a simpler one , the sc generator , that conserves particular features of the original process .",
    "in particular , by an appropriate choice of its parameter the sc process reproduces the correlation time of the field fluctuations induced by the original markov process .",
    "there are several advantages of the sc approximation .",
    "first , it is is correct both in the motional narrowing and the static dephasing limits ; thereby also the error in the intermediate regime is reduced considerably , when compared to perturbation approaches . and second , it provides a simple expression for the magnetization decay which may be solved analytically or at least numerically .",
    "however , the drawback of the sc approach was  up to now  that is not part of a systematic approximation to or an expansion of the original generator .",
    "therefore , it was unclear how results could be improved beyond the sc approximation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the sc approach and provide a framework for a systematic approximation .    in the next section",
    "we will present a formal description of spin dephasing that will be the basis for our analytical analysis . in sect .",
    "iii we will introduce the extended strong collision ( esc ) approximation proper and show how it is used to describe free induction and spin echo decay . in sect .",
    "iv we will apply it to two generic cases : spin dephasing induced by an anderson - weiss process @xcite and by restricted diffusion in a linear field gradient .",
    "we will close the paper with a summary and a discussion of our results .",
    "we assume that dephasing of transversely polarized nuclear spins exposed to an external field is induced by randomly fluctuating magnetic perturbation fields with frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a discrete or continuous variable .",
    "the transition dynamics between two distinct states @xmath9 and @xmath10 is that of a stationary continuous time markov process described by rates @xmath11 for the transition @xmath12 . the matrix @xmath13 as the generator of the markov process conserves the probability to find a spin within one state , i.e. @xmath14 . the eigenvalues @xmath6 of @xmath15 fulfill the condition @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the equilibrium probability distribution . to simplify the notation we denote the normalized left and right eigenvectors of @xmath15 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , with @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution between @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the transverse magnetization of spins in the state @xmath10 ( in polar notation @xmath23 ) results from the linear superposition of the transition and the precession dynamics , i.e. @xmath24 . the precession within the external field was omitted since it only induces a constant offset of the frequency which may be gauged to zero . with the diagonal frequency matrix @xmath25 one obtains for the magnetization @xmath26 @xmath27 which is a generalization of the bloch torrey equation @xcite originally formulated for diffusing spins , i.e.@xmath28 . in most cases",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the initial magnetization @xmath29 is proportional to the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath30 , e.g. when free diffusion is considered this would imply a homogeneous transverse magnetization .",
    "equation  ( [ gbt ] ) then provides the time evolution of the transverse magnetization ( free induction decay ) as @xmath31\\;|0\\rangle\\ ; , \\label{fid1}\\ ] ] where the initial magnetization was normalized to one .",

    "( [ fid1 ] ) and ( [ magn ] ) results from coherent and incoherent spin dephasing .",
    "the incoherent contribution is determined from spin echo experiments . in - plane",
    "polarized spins are rotated by a @xmath33 ( @xmath34-pulse ) after a time @xmath35 .",
    "this pulse transforms the original magnetization @xmath36 to its complex adjoint @xmath37\\;|0\\rangle$ ] .",
    "this procedure cancels the coherent spin dephasing after the time @xmath21 ( echo time ) , i.e. the decay of magnetization at @xmath21 is solely due to incoherent spin dephasing .",

    "the analytical determination of the free induction decay according to eqs .",
    "( [ magn ] ) is restricted to very few cases , e.g. free diffusion in a linear gradient or stochastic fluctuations between two precession frequencies .",
    "the idea of the strong collision approach and its extension is to replace the generator of the markov process @xmath15 by a more simple generator @xmath41 that conserves specific features of the original dynamics .      in many cases",
    "the stochastic fluctuations of the perturbation fields occur on a much shorter time scale than spin - dephasing , i.e. the correlation time @xmath2 of field fluctuations is much shorter than the relaxation time of the magnetization . for ergodic",
    "markov processes one can estimate that after a few @xmath2 a spin has visited almost all relevant states with the equilibrium probability . on the other hand , there is only little change of the magnetization during this time interval .",
    "therefore , spin dephasing in this situation can be described equivalently by a process in which the transition rate between two states @xmath42 is independent of the initial state .",
    "consequently , the transition rate for @xmath42 is proportional to the equilibrium probability of the final state , @xmath43 .",
    "such a dynamics is referred to as _",
    "strong collision dynamics_.    the generator @xmath41 of this process has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace generated by the the equilibrium eigenvector of @xmath15 , and @xmath46 is the identity operator .",
    "the factor @xmath47 has to be determined self consistently .    since the starting point of the strong collision approximation",
    "is the observation that  in many cases of interest  the correlation of the stochastic field fluctuations appear on a shorter time scale than that of changes of the magnetization , only the long time behavior of the field fluctuations is of importance .",
    "this long time behavior is characterized by the correlation time of the two - point autocorrelation function of the field fluctuations ( see also the appendix ) , @xmath48 which is defined as @xmath49\\o|0\\rangle}{\\langle 0|{\\bf\\omega}^2|0\\rangle-\\langle 0|{\\bf\\omega}|0\\rangle^2}\\label{2pointcf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] stochastic field fluctuations determined by the strong collision ( sc ) process should have the same correlation time as the original process , leading to the self - consistency condition @xmath50 it is easy to determine that the correlation time for the strong collision approximation is @xmath51 , see the appendix eq .",
    "( [ sctau ] ) , leading to @xmath52      the extension of the strong collision approximation is based on a comparison with the spectral expansion of the original operator , @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the ordered eigenvalues of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the projection operator onto the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath57 .",
    "since the time evolution operator is @xmath58 , it is clear that the low order eigenvalues determine the long - time behavior , while higher orders dominate shorter and shorter time scales . a comparison with a rewriting of eq .",
    "( [ strcollgen ] ) , @xmath59 ( note that @xmath60 ) , shows that in the strong collision approximation just the lowest order term of ( [ spectralexpansion ] ) is taken into account explicitly , while the contribution of the higher eigenvalues is approximated by the self - consistently determined parameter @xmath47 .    a natural extension , therefore , would be to take into account more low order eigenvalues explicitly , thereby increasing the accuracy of the description of the long - time behavior : @xmath61 with @xmath62 . a stochastic process generated by an operator @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ gstrocollgen ] ) will be referred to as simplified extended strong collision ( esc@xmath64 ) approximation of order @xmath65 . as before , the contribution of the higher eigenvalues is approximated by the parameter @xmath47 , which is determined again self - consistently from condition ( [ ctsc ] ) . here",
    "it leads to @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that for @xmath69 this equation becomes ( [ lambda ] ) again .",
    "however , there are several problems involved with an approximation based on ( [ gstrocollgen ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "practically , an exact determination of the low order eigenvalues and eigenvectors is possible only in special cases .",
    "therefore , one has to deal with the problem that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known either only approximately or not at all .",
    "furthermore , even with eigenvalues and eigenfunctions known , it turns out that the esc approximation may be not applicable at all in certain situations : if the autocorrelation function of the field fluctuations is determined fully by the eigenfunctions included in @xmath70 , eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) is undetermined . in that case",
    "additional self - consistency requirements would be necessary for a better description of the intermediate time regime .",
    "nevertheless , the above approach can be readily adapted to these situations .",
    "equation ( [ gstrocollgen ] ) can be viewed as an optimized reduced description of the relaxation in various subspaces of the original operator @xmath15 .",
    "such a optimized description should also be possible for subspaces that are not eigenvectors of @xmath15 .",
    "we can , therefore , set @xmath71 however , now the rates @xmath72 , @xmath73 are not eigenvalues anymore , but have to be determined by additional self - consistency requirements , see below .",
    "moreover , the @xmath74 are not projectors onto the eigenspace of a particular eigenvalue , but onto the spaces defined by arbitrarily chosen mutually orthogonal functions @xmath75 , @xmath73 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; i.e. the projectors have the form @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "naturally , one would try to choose the functions @xmath75 close to the eigenfunctions @xmath80 , although it is not required for the extension to work .",
    "another natural function space for example is based on polynomials in the frequency operator @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 where @xmath83 is some polynomial of degree @xmath9 , the coefficients of which are chosen in such a way that the orthonormal relations are fulfilled . in the following",

    "we mentioned already that the rates @xmath72 , @xmath73 , in eq .",
    "( [ gstrocollgen2 ] ) have to be determined now by additional self - consistency requirements .",
    "as it was with the sc approximation , the aim of the esc@xmath64 approximation is to approximate more closely the correlation of field fluctuations .",
    "this is achieved by considering also higher order correlation functions @xmath87 following the same arguments as for the strong collision approximation , the long time behavior of the @xmath88 is of interest . in the same way as for the strong collision approximation",
    "this should be characterized by some first order statistical moment which is obtained by integration of the correlation function over @xmath89 .",
    "however , direct usage of @xmath88 is hampered by its non - vanishing asymptotic behavior : it is easily seen that from the relation @xmath90 follows @xmath91 which does not necessarily vanish . in the strong collision approximation we avoided this problem by considering the operator @xmath92 $ ] instead of @xmath93 in eq .",

    "( [ hocf ] ) we obtain modified correlation functions @xmath94 that we will call _ quasi cumulants _ ( s. appendix ) .",
    "they vanish asymptotically for all @xmath95 .",

    "the relaxation rates are , therefore , determined by @xmath97 which replace the single self - consistency condition ( [ ctsc ] ) .",
    "note that in many systems the correlation functions @xmath94 vanish for odd values of @xmath98 due to symmetry .",

    "( [ ctsc2 ] ) is more balanced than when only eq .",
    "( [ ctsc ] ) is used , and gives rise to an improved approximation .",
    "moreover , the self - consistency conditions ( [ ctsc2 ] ) imply that both processes , the esc process and the original markov process have the same motional narrowing expansion of the transverse relaxation , as it is shown in the appendix , eq .",

    "this specific feature of the esc dynamics tremendously facilitates the actual determination of spin dephasing for the following reasons : ( @xmath9 ) in many cases the propagator in the static motion regime ( which is an average phase factor ) may be determined analytically or at least numerically ; ( @xmath267 ) the determination of the propagator from that in the static motion regime is self contained within the base , i.e. it is obtained from a combination of finite dimensional matrices .",
