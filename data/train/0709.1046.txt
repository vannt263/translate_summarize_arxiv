    "direct observations of sunspot numbers over 400 years , as well as proxy data for much longer timescales @xcite , show that both the amplitude and the duration of the solar magnetic cycle vary from one cycle to the next .",
    "the importance of this phenomenon lies in the contribution of varying levels of solar activity to long - term climate change , and to short - term space weather @xcite .",
    "while there is now a concensus that the sun s magnetic field is generated by a hydromagnetic dynamo @xcite , the origin of fluctuations in the basic cycle is yet to be conclusively determined .",
    "several different mechanisms have been proposed , including nonlinear effects @xcite , stochastic forcing @xcite , and time - delay dynamics @xcite .",
    "a coupled , equally important , but ill - understood issue is how the memory of these fluctuations , whatever may be its origin , carries over from one cycle to another mediated via flux transport processes within the solar convection zone ( scz ) .",
    "a unified understanding of all these disparate processes lays the physical foundation for the predictability ( or lack - thereof ) of future solar activity .",
    "these considerations motivate the current study .",
    "the main flux transport processes in the scz involve magnetic buoyancy ( timescale on the order of months ) , meridional circulation , diffusion and downward flux - pumping ( timescales relatively larger ) .",
    "because magnetic buoyancy , i.e. , the buoyant rise of magnetic flux tubes , acts on timescales much shorter than the solar cycle timescale , the fluctuations that it produces are also short - lived in comparison .",
    "our focus here is on longer - term fluctuations , on the order of the solar cycle period , that may lead to predictive capabilities .    through an analysis of observational data ,",
    "@xcite have shown that the solar cycle amplitude and duration are correlated with the equatorward drift velocity of the sunspot belts during the cycle .",
    "they associate this drift velocity with the deep meridional counterflow that must exist to balance the poleward flows that are observed at the surface ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results show a significant negative correlation between the drift velocity and the cycle duration , so that the drift is faster in shorter cycles , consistent with the interpretation of meridional circulation as the timekeeper of the solar cycle ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition @xcite identified positive correlations between the drift velocity of cycle @xmath2 and the amplitudes of both cycles @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "while the two - cycle time lag was a new result , the positive correlation between circulation speed and amplitude of the same cycle is supported by several earlier studies . in their surface flux transport model ,",
    "@xcite needed a varying meridional flow , faster in higher - amplitude cycles , to sustain regular reversals in the sun s polar field .",
    "they cited observational evidence from polar faculae counts @xcite , which peaked early for two of the stronger cycles , coinciding with poleward surges of magnetic flux .",
    "furthermore , observations show a statistically - significant negative correlation between peak sunspot number and the duration of cycles 1 to 22 ( figure 1c of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a negative correlation between cycle amplitude and duration is also found in the models of @xcite and @xcite . taken with the inverse relation between cycle duration and circulation speed ,",
    "this is again suggestive of a positive correlation between circulation speed and cycle amplitude .",
    "meridional circulation plays an important role in a certain class of theoretical solar cycle models often referred to as `` flux - transport '' , `` advection - dominated , '' or `` circulation - dominated '' dynamo models ( see , e.g. , the review by nandy 2004 ) .",
    "such models have gained popularity in recent years owing to their success in reproducing various observed features of the solar cycle @xcite . in these models , a single - cell meridional circulation in each hemisphere ( which is observed at the solar surface ) is invoked to transport poloidal field , first poleward at near - surface layers and then down to the tachocline where toroidal field is generated .",
    "subsequently , the return flow in the circulation advects this toroidal field belt equatorward through a region at the base of the scz which is characterized by low diffusivity . from this deep toroidal field belt ,",
    "destabilized flux tubes rise to the surface due to magnetic buoyancy , producing sunspots @xcite .",
    "we may point out here that the name `` flux - transport dynamo '' is somewhat inappropriate to classify a circulation or advection - dominated dynamo ( where the diffusion timescale is much larger than the circulation timescale throughout the dynamo domain ) .",
    "our results indicate that diffusive flux - transport in the scz could play a dominant role in dynamos even when the cycle period is governed by meridional circulation speed , pointing out that flux - transport is a shared process .",
    "so , henceforth , by `` flux - transport '' dynamo , we imply a dynamo where the transport of magnetic field is shared by magnetic buoyancy , meridional circulation , and diffusion .",
    "flux - transport dynamos offer the possibility of prediction because of their inherent memory .",
    "this arises specifically when the dynamo source regions for poloidal field production ( the traditional @xmath0-effect ) and toroidal field generation ( the @xmath1-effect ) are spatially segregated .",
    "a brief discussion on important timescales ( we identify three significant ones ) in the dynamo process is merited here .",
    "the first is governed by the buoyant rise of toroidal flux tubes from the @xmath1-effect layer to the @xmath0-effect layer to generate the poloidal field ; since this is a fast process on the order of months , no significant memory is introduced here .",
    "the second involves the transport of poloidal field back into the @xmath1-effect layer ( either by circulation or diffusion ) .",
    "this could be a slow process where significant memory is introduced which is dominated by the fastest of the competing processes ( advection versus diffusion ) .",
    "the third timescale relates to the slow equatorward transport of the toroidal field belt through the base of the scz , which sets the period of the sunspot cycle . in this class of dynamo models , with meridional circulation and low diffusivities in the tachocline ( at the base of the scz ) ,",
    "the third timescale is almost invariably determined by the circulation speed .",
    "it is the second timescale above , with competing effects of diffusive flux transport and advective flux transport , that becomes important in the context of the persistence of memory . in",
    "the advection - dominated , stochastically fluctuating model of @xcite , this second timescale ( governed by advection of poloidal field due to meridional circulation ) was about 17 years , so that the polar field at the end of cycle @xmath2 correlated strongest with the toroidal field of cycle @xmath3 rather than that of cycle @xmath4 .",
    "the length of memory of any particular flux - transport dynamo model is unfortunately dependent on the internal meridional flow profile , and on other chosen properties of the convection zone which are not yet well - determined observationally .",
    "a particular problem is the strength of diffusivity in the convection zone , which strongly affects the mode of operation of the dynamo .    even if one assumes that these flux - transport dynamos capture enough of the realistic physics of the scz to make predictions of future solar activity , these predictions are critically dependent on the relative role of diffusion and advection in the scz .",
    "@xcite , in their highly _ advection - dominated _ model , show that bands of latitudinal field from three previous cycles remain `` lined up in the meridional circulation conveyor belt '' .",
    "they suggest that poloidal fields from cycles @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 combine to produce the toroidal field of cycle @xmath2 .",
    "based on an assumed proxy for the solar poloidal fields ( sunspot area ) , this leads them to predict that cycle 24 will be about @xmath8 stronger than cycle 23 @xcite . in stark contrast ,",
    "@xcite , using a flux - transport dynamo model with _ diffusion - dominated _ scz , and using as inputs the observed strength of the solar dipole moment ( as a proxy for the poloidal field ) , predict that cycle 24 will be about @xmath9 _ weaker _ than cycle 23 .",
    "@xcite argue that the main contribution to the toroidal field of cycle @xmath2 , comes only from the polar field of cycle @xmath7 ( see also @xcite for further details of this model ) .",
    "the conflicting predictions from these two solar dynamo models presumably result from the difference in the memory ( i.e. , survival ) of past cycle fields in these models and could be to some extent influenced by the different inputs they use as proxies for the solar poloidal field .",
    "we also hypothesize that stronger diffusion in the @xcite model destroys polar field faster , and that flux transport by diffusion across the scz in this model short - circuits the meridional circulation conveyor belt , thereby shortening the memory of previous cycles .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis to test these ideas . to begin with",
    ", we consider a wider parameter space in the present paper , where we study the effect of varying meridional circulation speed and scz diffusivity on the amplitude and period of the solar cycle . in these simulations , we keep all other parameters the same , allowing a direct comparison between advection - dominated and diffusion - dominated scz regimes  which has previously been clouded by other differences between models .",
    "then we introduce stochastic fluctuations in the model @xmath0-effect to self - consistently generate cycle - amplitude variations  as a completely theoretical construct towards studying cycle - to - cycle variations , in contrast to using diverse observed proxies for time - varying poloidal fields .",
    "subsequently , we perform a comparative analysis of the persistence of memory in this stochastically forced dynamo model in both the advective and diffusive flux - transport dominated regimes",
    ". therefore , in spirit , this paper deals with the underlying physics of solar cycle predictability , and is not concerned with making a prediction itself .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "the main features of the model are summarised in section [ sec : model ] , and the results of the parameter - space study are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "these results are interpreted in section [ sec : regimes ] . in section [ sec : timedelays ] we analyze the persistence of memory in the advection versus diffusion dominated regimes .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a discussion on the relevance of this work in the context of developing predictive capabilities for the solar activity cycle .",
    "we use the solar dynamo code _ surya _ , which has been studied extensively in different contexts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and is made available to the public on request .",
    "the major ingredients of the code include an analytic fit to the helioseismically - determined differential rotation profile , a single - cell meridional circulation in the scz , different diffusivities for the toroidal and poloidal fields , a buoyancy algorithm to model radial transport of magnetic flux , and a babcock - leighton ( bl ; @xcite , @xcite ) type @xmath0-effect localized near the surface layer ( signifying the generation of poloidal field due to the evolution of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs under surface flux transport ) .",
    "the code solves the kinematic mean - field dynamo equations for an axisymmetric magnetic field , which may be expressed in spherical coordinates @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 $ ] correspond to the toroidal and poloidal components respectively .",
    "the mean - field mhd induction equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) then leads to the following standard equations for the @xmath0-@xmath1 dynamo problem : @xmath14 here @xmath15 , and we specify the meridional flow @xmath16 , the internal angular velocity @xmath1 , the diffusivities @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the coefficient @xmath0 for the bl @xmath0-effect which describes the generation of poloidal field at the solar surface from the decay of bipolar sunspots .",
    "note that although for modelling purposes the bl @xmath0-effect is mathematically similar to the traditional mean - field @xmath0-effect due to small - scale helical turbulence , the former is fundamentally different .",
    "the bl @xmath0-effect acts on much larger spatial ( on the order of active regions or greater ) and temporal ( surface flux transport ) scales , and is quenched at much stronger field strengths ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the profiles of @xmath1 and @xmath0 were described in @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "we will , however , describe the meridional circulation and diffusivity profiles in more detail .",
    "the meridional circulation is defined in terms of a streamfunction @xmath20 , giving the velocity by @xmath21,\\ ] ] where we assume the density stratification @xmath22 the streamfunction is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 is the radius of the sun , @xmath30 is the bottom of the simulation domain , and @xmath31 is the penetration depth of the meridional circulation .",
    "we combine the arbitrary constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the parameter @xmath34 which gives , approximately , the flow speed near the surface at mid - latitudes .",
    "it is this parameter @xmath35 which we vary to change the circulation speed in this study .",
    "the circulation profile is illustrated in figure [ fig : merid ] for @xmath36 .",
    "the dots are plotted at yearly intervals for particles moving along the streamlines shown .",
    "we use different diffusivities for the toroidal and poloidal fields , defined as follows : @xmath37\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + \\frac{\\eta_0-\\eta_1}{2}\\left[1+{\\,\\textrm{erf}}\\left(\\frac{r - r_{tcz}}{d_t}\\right)\\right],\\\\ \\eta_p(r ) & = \\eta_{rz } + \\frac{\\eta_2-\\eta_{rz}}{2}\\left[1+{\\,\\textrm{erf}}\\left(\\frac{r - r_{bcz}}{d_t}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad + \\frac{\\eta_0-\\eta_2}{2}\\left[1+{\\,\\textrm{erf}}\\left(\\frac{r - r_{tcz}}{d_t}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . in the radiative core we choose a low diffusivity , namely @xmath42 , representing molecular diffusivity only since there is no turbulent convection .",
    "we always choose @xmath43 so that the toroidal field diffusivity @xmath18 in the convection zone is lower than the poloidal field diffusivity @xmath17 .",
    "this is to model the suppression of turbulent diffusivity by strong magnetic fields , as toroidal field tends to be strong and concentrated in localised flux tubes and therefore subject to less diffusion @xcite , whereas poloidal field is weaker and subject to more diffusion . at the surface both",
    "diffusivities increase to a high value ( of the order of @xmath44 ) , in line with surface flux transport models and observational estimates .",
    "typical profiles are illustrated in figure [ fig : eta ] .",
    "we solve equations ( [ eqn : aevol ] ) and ( [ eqn : bevol ] ) in a meridional plane @xmath45 , @xmath46 , representing the northern hemisphere .",
    "this is divided into a spherical grid of 128 by 128 cells , uniformly spaced in @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we use the same boundary conditions as @xcite , except that we consider only the northern hemisphere and set @xmath49 and @xmath50 at the equator ( @xmath51 ) , thereby forcing the solution to have dipolar parity .",
    "example solutions for two different runs are shown in time - latitude plots in figures [ fig : fields](a ) and ( b ) , where the black lines denote contours of toroidal field strength at the base of the convection zone ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the solar butterfly diagram , with the strongest field located at the active latitudes and migrating equatorward during each cycle .",
    "the background shading shows the strength of the radial field at the solar surface ( @xmath53 ) , which peaks at the pole several years after the toroidal field maxima ( of the same sign ) at low latitudes .",
    "the two solutions in figure [ fig : fields ] characterize the diffusion - dominated scz ( figure [ fig : fields]a ) and advection - dominated scz ( figure [ fig : fields]b ) regimes of the dynamo . in figure",
    "[ fig : fields](b ) the toroidal field shows a poleward branch at high latitude which is absent in figure [ fig : fields](a ) , and also a stronger radial polar field at the surface .",
    "the cause of these differences between the two regimes will become clear in section [ sec : regimes ] .",
    "we have carried out a parameter - space study to investigate how the cycle duration and amplitude in our model depend on the speed of meridional circulation and on the diffusivity in the convection zone . in each run of the code",
    "the parameters are held constant in time , but they are varied between different runs . specifically , we vary the parameter @xmath35 , which gives the maximum circulation speed , and also @xmath54 , which affects the diffusive decay and transport of the _ poloidal _ field in the convection zone , but not the toroidal field . in all runs",
    "we keep a surface diffusivity of @xmath55 , and a toroidal field diffusivity of @xmath56 in the convection zone .",
    "these choices approximate the fact that turbulent diffusion is expected to be more efficient in the decay and dispersal of the weaker poloidal field , but less so for the stronger toroidal field ; the latter suppresses the convective motions that give rise to turbulent diffusivity in the first place",
    ". the @xmath0-effect coefficient is not varied , but is set to @xmath57 for each run .",
    "this particular value was chosen to ensure that periodic solutions could be obtained for a wide range of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath54 .",
    "each run was started from an arbitrary initial state , and then evolved until initial transients had disappeared , leaving a steady periodic dynamo solution .",
    "such a periodic solution was found to exist only within a certain range of @xmath35 for each value of @xmath54 .",
    "the cycle duration and amplitude were then measured from the periodic solutions , in the cases where such a solution was found .",
    "we define the cycle duration and amplitude by considering the time evolution of the toroidal magnetic flux @xmath58 in a certain region around the base of the convection zone .",
    "specifically , the toroidal field @xmath12 is integrated at each time step over a region @xmath59 to @xmath60 , @xmath61 to @xmath62 ( i.e. , over the tachocline and latitudes @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) .",
    "this magnetic flux @xmath58 should be proportional to the active region magnetic flux at the solar surface , under the assumption that more toroidal flux at the base of the convection zone leads to more buoyant eruptions . in a steady dynamo solution the flux",
    "@xmath58 varies in strictly periodic manner , with its maximum amplitude giving the `` cycle amplitude '' .",
    "we define the `` cycle duration '' to be the interval between successive peaks of @xmath65 ( half of the full dynamo period ) .",
    "this is therefore equivalent to the standard definition of the 11-year solar activity cycle , but of course the simulated periods are different .",
    "the resulting cycle duration and cycle amplitude are plotted as functions of the circulation speed @xmath35 in figures [ fig : dur_v0 ] and [ fig : amp_v0 ] respectively . in these figures",
    "each curve corresponds to a different value of the diffusivity @xmath54 .",
    "the range of speeds covered by each curve indicates the range for which the code relaxed to a steady periodic dynamo solution , up to a maximum of @xmath66 . in figure",
    "[ fig : amp_diff ] the cycle amplitude is plotted as a function of @xmath54 , and in this case each curve corresponds to a different circulation speed @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig : dur_v0 ] shows a clear inverse dependence of the cycle duration on the meridional circulation speed @xmath35 , with faster circulation leading to shorter cycles .",
    "a least - squares fit for the curve with @xmath67 gives the dependence of the cycle period on meridional flow speed @xmath68 where @xmath69 is in years and @xmath35 is in metres per second .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath70 found by @xcite , and this inverse relation is a well - established result for babcock - leighton dynamo models . in these models",
    "the circulation , and specifically the equatorward counterflow at the bottom of the convection zone , is the primary determinant of the cycle period @xcite .",
    "the cycle duration is only weakly dependent on the diffusivity @xmath54 .",
    "a power - law fit for the curve with @xmath71 gives @xmath72 years .",
    "the lower power of @xmath35 here indicates that for higher - diffusivity solutions the cycle duration is slightly less dependent on circulation speed , presumably because flux transport by diffusive dispersal starts becoming important .",
    "also , it is evident from figure [ fig : dur_v0 ] that , at lower circulation speeds , there is a maximum diffusivity for which a periodic solution can exist .",
    "if there is too much diffusion at a low circulation speed , then the poloidal field will decay too much during its transport from high to low latitudes , thus generating insufficient toroidal field to sustain a periodic dynamo process .",
    "the essential difference between advective and diffusive flux transport is that the latter also reduces field strength during transport , due to diffusive decay .",
    "now we turn to the dependence of cycle amplitude on the speed of meridional circulation .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : amp_v0 ] , where each curve corresponds to a different diffusivity @xmath54 according to the legend .",
    "rather than being monotonic , the cycle amplitude first increases with @xmath35 for low @xmath35 and then decreases with @xmath35 for large @xmath35 , with a turnover at some value of @xmath35 in between .",
    "the location of this turnover shifts to higher speeds as the diffusivity is increased .",
    "the dependence of cycle amplitude on diffusivity at any given circulation speed is not entirely clear on figure [ fig : amp_v0 ] , but is evident in figure [ fig : amp_diff ] , where cycle amplitude is plotted against diffusivity @xmath54 . in this figure",
    "each curve corresponds to a different value of the circulation speed @xmath35 .",
    "we see a similar behavior in that the cycle amplitude first increases with @xmath54 for low @xmath54 and then decreases with @xmath54 for high @xmath54 , with a turnover in between .",
    "if the circulation speed is increased , then the value of @xmath54 corresponding to this turnover also increases .",
    "the behaviour of the cycle amplitude in our model , as illustrated in figures [ fig : amp_v0 ] and [ fig : amp_diff ] , is more complex than expected _ a priori_. rather than a simple linear dependence on the circulation speed @xmath35 , there is a turnover in cycle amplitude , at a speed which changes depending on the diffusivity in the convection zone . in the next section",
    "we investigate the cause of this behaviour in the model .",
    "the turnover of cycle amplitude as depicted in figure [ fig : amp_v0 ] occurs at a higher circulation speed @xmath35 as the diffusivity @xmath54 is increased .",
    "the asterisks ( joined by a thin line ) in figure [ fig : regimes](a ) show the location of this turnover as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "we may think of this line in the @xmath73 plane as the dividing line between two distinct regimes of the dynamo , which we call _ advection - dominated _ and _ diffusion - dominated_. the advection - dominated regime corresponds to high circulation speed and low diffusivity , while the diffusion - dominated regime corresponds to low circulation speed and high diffusivity .",
    "a shift from one of these regimes to another affects flux - transport dynamics in a way that results in contrasting dependence of cycle amplitude on the governing parameters .",
    "consider how the cycle amplitude varies with @xmath35 for a fixed value of @xmath54 , corresponding to a curve on figure [ fig : amp_v0 ] . in the diffusion - dominated regime ,",
    "a higher circulation speed means less time for diffusive decay of the poloidal field during its transport through the convection zone , leading to more generation of toroidal field and hence a higher cycle amplitude . in the advection - dominated regime ,",
    "a higher circulation speed leads to a lower cycle amplitude because there is less time to amplify toroidal field in the tachocline ( through which magnetic fields are swept through at a faster speed ) .",
    "it is the balance between these conflicting influences that leads to a turnover in cycle amplitude at some intermediate circulation speed .    the bold line in figure [ fig : regimes](a ) shows the transition point between the two regimes that may be inferred from a simple balance between circulation and diffusion timescales @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for a given circulation speed @xmath35",
    ", we define the circulation timescale @xmath74 as the time taken for meridional circulation to advect poloidal fields from @xmath76 to the location where the strongest toroidal field is formed at the tachocline ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the diffusion timescale is defined as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the radial distance across the convection zone from the same starting point .",
    "the two timescales are compared in figure [ fig : regimes](b ) , where each horizontal line gives the circulation time @xmath74 for a different speed @xmath35 , and the bold curve gives @xmath75 as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "the crossing points of horizontal lines with this curve give the transition points between the advection dominated ( @xmath80 ) and diffusion dominated ( @xmath81 ) regimes from these simple theoretical considerations ",
    "which are in good agreement with the simulated transition points .",
    "we now compare the poloidal and toroidal field evolution in the two regimes .",
    "figure [ fig : adpoloidal ] shows the poloidal field lines for two runs , at different times through the cycle , starting from one cycle minimum and finishing at the next cycle minimum , so that the fields reverse in sign .",
    "the left - hand column is taken from a run with @xmath82 and @xmath67 , which is in the advection - dominated regime .",
    "the right - hand column is from a diffusion - dominated run with the same @xmath35 but with @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ fig : adtoroidal ] shows the evolution of the toroidal field for the same two runs .",
    "the key difference between the two regimes is the rate at which the poloidal field is able to diffuse through the convection zone , after it is generated at the surface by the babcock - leighton @xmath0-effect .",
    "this is seen clearly by comparing the poloidal field evolution between 8 and 12 years in the two runs ( figures [ fig : adpoloidal]c / h and d / i ) . in",
    "the diffusion - dominated run the new clockwise poloidal field diffuses directly down to the tachocline at all latitudes between these two times .",
    "however , in the advection - dominated run the new poloidal field does not reach the tachocline until the end of the cycle ( 16 years ) , and reaches the high latitudes before it reaches the tachocline ; i.e. , in this case , the field evolution follows the meridional circulation conveyor belt .",
    "there is still significant anticlockwise poloidal field remaining below the tachocline from the previous cycle , and even a lower band of clockwise field from the cycle before that . in the diffusion - dominated case",
    "there is only a weak band of anticlockwise field remaining from the previous cycle at solar minimum .",
    "this suggests that in the advection - dominated regime , poloidal fields from cycles @xmath2 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 combine to produce the toroidal field for cycle @xmath4 , while in the diffusion - dominated regime it is produced primarily from cycle @xmath2 poloidal field , with a small contribution from cycle @xmath7 .",
    "the main difference in toroidal field evolution seen in figure [ fig : adtoroidal ] is during the rising phase of the cycle , seen at 4 and 8 years ( panels b / g and c / h ) . in the advection - dominated regime",
    "there are two separate regions of toroidal field generation , one region at high latitudes from poloidal field which has been advected poleward by the meridional circulation , and a second region at lower latitudes arising from direct diffusion of poloidal field across the convection zone . in the diffusion - dominated case",
    "there is no strong generation of toroidal field at high latitudes . in this case",
    "the strongest field generation occurs at mid to low latitudes , with direct diffusion presumably being the primary means of transporting poloidal field to the base of the convection zone ( i.e. , the meridional circulation conveyor belt is `` short - circuited '' ) .",
    "we point our however that , contrary to usual expectations , diffusive flux transport still plays a role in the advection - dominated case , and it is responsible for the complex dependence of cycle amplitude on diffusivity in the advection - dominated regime ; we explore this issue below .",
    "we have thus far identified the turnover in cycle amplitude to lie at the transition point between advection - dominated and diffusion - dominated regimes of the dynamo . within the umbrella of this model , this maximum in the amplitude",
    "is understood to be a balance between the time available for toroidal field amplification and the time available for poloidal field decay .",
    "figure [ fig : amp_diff ] shows how the cycle amplitude varies with the diffusivity @xmath54 for a fixed circulation speed @xmath35 .",
    "we see that there is a turnover in cycle amplitude for some value of @xmath54 , with lower diffusivities corresponding to the advection - dominated regime , and higher diffusivities to the diffusion - dominated regime . in the diffusion - dominated regime , which is only reached for lower speeds @xmath35 in figure [ fig : amp_diff ] , the cycle amplitude decreases with increasing diffusivity .",
    "this is expected due to increased cancellation and decay of the poloidal field . however , in the advection - dominated regime , the cycle amplitude _",
    "increases _ as the diffusivity @xmath54 is increased .",
    "this initially seems counter - intuitive , but we show here that it is caused by the influence of direct diffusive flux transport of poloidal field across the convection zone .",
    "this direct diffusion ( from the solar surface to the base of the scz ) was visible in the poloidal field evolution plots shown in the previous section ; we now demonstrate its quantitative effect as @xmath54 is varied , by comparing the poloidal field strength @xmath83 at the base of the convection zone ( @xmath84 ) with that at the solar surface ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we take the ratio @xmath85 , using the peak value of @xmath86 at each location during the solar cycle .",
    "this ratio is plotted in figure [ fig : polratio ] , measured at latitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and for two different circulation speeds .",
    "thin lines correspond to @xmath89 , where the dynamo is in the advection - dominated regime for the whole range of @xmath54 shown .",
    "thick lines correspond to @xmath82 , for which the dynamo changes between the two regimes at about @xmath90 .",
    "consider first the behaviour at @xmath87 latitude ( solid lines in figure [ fig : polratio ] ) . here",
    "the curves for both @xmath35 have positive slope , which implies that a greater proportion of poloidal field from the surface reaches the bottom of the convection zone as @xmath54 is increased .",
    "thus direct diffusive flux transport at lower latitudes always acts to increase the amount of poloidal field reaching the base of the convection zone .",
    "nearer to the pole , at @xmath88 latitude ( dashed lines in figure [ fig : polratio ] ) , the behaviour is different . here",
    "the ratio decreases as @xmath54 is increased , both for the curve with @xmath89 and in the diffusion - dominated regime for @xmath82 . in the advection - dominated regime for @xmath82",
    "however , the ratio first increases with @xmath54 .",
    "this suggests a more complex relation between the surface and tachocline poloidal fields at high latitude , with competing influence from both diffusive and advective flux transport .",
    "this is expected because the downflow in the circulation is located at high latitudes .",
    "the analysis presented in this section supports the idea that direct diffusive transport of poloidal field across the convection zone , especially around mid - latitudes , is responsible for the trend of increasing cycle amplitude with increasing diffusivity , found in the advection - dominated regime .",
    "although such diffusive transport acts to increase cycle amplitude in both regimes , diffusion also causes the poloidal field that is being transported by meridional circulation to decay , cancelling with field from the previous cycle that is stored below the tachocline .",
    "thus diffusion also has a negative effect on cycle amplitude .",
    "it is this negative effect which dominates at higher diffusivities , forcing the dynamo into the diffusion - dominated regime where cycle amplitude decreases with increasing diffusivity .",
    "it is expected that the memory of a flux - transport dynamo is much longer in the advection - dominated regime than in the diffusion - dominated regime , and solar cycle predictions have been based on this expectation @xcite . however , a detailed comparative analysis of persistence of memory in these different regimes under the umbrella of the same model had not been previously performed .",
    "our analysis in the previous section has brought us closer to understanding the flux transport dynamics ( in these two regimes ) that is the physical basis for any memory mechanism . in this section ,",
    "we consider how the persistence of this memory differs between the two regimes , by looking at the correlation between peak polar and toroidal fields of subsequent cycles .",
    "since the simulations considered earlier relaxed to a regular periodic cycle , we can not use these to study correlations between different cycles .",
    "therefore , we now introduce self - consistent fluctuations in the cycle properties by means of a stochastically varying @xmath0-effect , and explore the resulting correlations between different cycles .",
    "we introduce fluctuations in the model by varying the coefficient @xmath91 of the @xmath0-effect ( see @xcite for the full expression ) .",
    "we set @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the mean value , @xmath94 gives the maximum amplitude of the fluctuations ( corresponding to the 200% level ) , and @xmath95 is a uniform random deviate selected from the interval @xmath96 $ ] , with a new value after each coherence time @xmath97 .",
    "although for our purposes this is essentially a device for changing the cycle properties from one cycle to the next , there is a strong physical basis for stochastic variations in @xmath0 which have been invoked in several previous studies @xcite .",
    "our model uses a babcock - leighton @xmath0-effect where poloidal field is generated at the surface from the decay of tilted active regions @xcite .",
    "thus stochastic variations in the @xmath0 coefficient are natural , because it arises from the cumulative effect of a finite number of discrete flux emergence events ( active region eruptions with varying degrees of tilt ) .    to compare the two regimes we consider two runs , both with @xmath98 .",
    "the circulation speed @xmath35 is kept constant throughout each run , and only the @xmath0 effect is varied .",
    "run 1 has @xmath99 , so is diffusion - dominated , while run 2 has @xmath100 and is advection - dominated .",
    "the coherence time @xmath97 is set to @xmath101 years in run 1 and @xmath102 years in run 2 , so as to keep the ratio of the former to the cycle duration roughly the same in each case .",
    "we note that although the exact value of the coherence time is not important for our study ( and is introduced just as a means to enable sufficient fluctuations ) , the timescale  on the order of a year  is chosen to reflect that the bl @xmath0-effect is a result of surface flux transport processes ( diffusion , meridional circulation and differential rotation ) which can take up to a year to generate a net radial ( component of the poloidal ) field from multiple flux emergence events @xcite .      in this section",
    "we compare the peak surface radial flux @xmath103 for cycle @xmath2 with the peak toroidal flux @xmath104 for cycles @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath105 . the toroidal flux is defined as before by integrating @xmath12 over the region @xmath106 to @xmath107 , @xmath61 to @xmath62 . the radial flux @xmath103 is found by integrating @xmath108 over the solar surface between @xmath109 to @xmath110 , ( i.e. , latitudes @xmath111 to @xmath112 ) .",
    "note that the peak toroidal flux precedes the peak surface radial flux for the same cycle , which has the same sign . the poloidal field then produces the toroidal field for cycle @xmath4 with the opposite sign .",
    "we measure the correlation of the surface radial flux for cycle @xmath2 with the toroidal flux of different cycles , comparing the absolute value of each total signed flux .",
    "both runs were computed for a total of 275 cycles with fluctuating @xmath91 , so as to produce meaningful statistics for each of the dynamo regimes .",
    "the results are illustrated in figures [ fig : cordiff ] and [ fig : coradv ] as scatter - plots of @xmath113 for different cycles against @xmath114 .",
    "the ( non - parametric ) spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath115 is given above each plot , along with its significance level .",
    "the correlation coefficients are summarised in table [ tab : correlations ] , where the pearson s linear correlation coefficient @xmath116 is also given for comparison .",
    "although the latter is less reliable , as it assumes a linear relation , it agrees well with @xmath115 in each case .",
    "the results show a clear difference between the two regimes .",
    "the advection - dominated regime shows significant correlations at all 4 time delays , apparently suggesting that the memory of past poloidal field survives for at least 3 cycles ; however , more on this later .",
    "the diffusion - dominated regime has a strong correlation only between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , suggesting that the dominant memory relates to just a one cycle time - lag , although very weak correlations are also found with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    in both regimes",
    "the strongest relation is the positive correlation between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this is to be expected as this is the more deterministic phase of the cycle  where toroidal fields ( of cycle @xmath4 , say ) are inducted from the older cycle @xmath2 poloidal field via the relatively steady differential rotation .",
    "note however that the two fluxes do not have to be directly coupled , in that the two fluxes may be positively correlated because they are both created from the mid - latitude poloidal field of cycle @xmath2 ( generated by the @xmath0-effect ) .",
    "the polar flux @xmath117 arises through poleward meridional transport of the cycle @xmath2 poloidal field , while the toroidal flux @xmath118 is generated from cycle @xmath2 poloidal field that is diffusively transported across the convection zone .",
    "this is particularly the case in the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "nonetheless , even this indirect scenario suggests that the strongest correlation should in fact be between the cycle @xmath2 poloidal field and cycle @xmath4 toroidal field in this class of @xmath0-@xmath1 dynamo models .",
    "the other phase of the cycle , in which the poloidal field is generated by the @xmath0-effect , is inherently more random due to the fluctuating @xmath0-effect in these runs .",
    "nevertheless , there is a strong positive correlation between @xmath119 and @xmath117 in the advection - dominated regime , while this correlation is largely absent in the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "this we attribute to the relatively stronger role of advective flux transport in the advection - dominated regime  which implies that a larger fraction of the original toroidal flux that has buoyantly erupted is transported to the polar regions by the circulation . in effect",
    "therefore , the advection - dominated regime allows correlations to propagate _ in both phases of the cycle _ , whereas the diffusion - dominated case allows correlations to propagate only in the poloidal - to - toroidal phase .",
    "the other correlation is broken in the diffusion - dominated regime because the advection is short - circuited by direct diffusion , which transports flux downwards and equatorward  where it is cancelled by oppositely signed flux from the other hemisphere .",
    "this explains how the correlations can survive for multiple cycles in the advection - dominated regime , but not in the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "significant uncertainties remain in our understanding of the physics of the solar dynamo mechanism , implying that prediction of future solar activity based on physical models is a challenging task . here",
    "we have demonstrated how a flux - transport dynamo model behaves differently in advection and diffusion dominated regimes .",
    "such differences , amongst others , have previously led to conflicting predictions of the amplitude of cycle 24 .",
    "@xcite use an advection - dominated model to predict a much stronger cycle than cycle 23 , whereas @xcite use a diffusion - dominated model to predict a much weaker cycle .",
    "the latter prediction is somewhat similar in spirit to the precursor methods @xcite , which use the polar field at cycle minimum to predict the amplitude of the following cycle .",
    "owing to the lack of observations of conditions inside the convection zone , opinions differ as to whether the real solar dynamo is weakly or strongly diffusive ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we find that for low circulation speeds @xmath35 ( in the diffusion - dominated regime ) , the cycle amplitude is an increasing function of @xmath35 , as in the observations of @xcite .",
    "however , the amplitude curve has a turnover point and is a decreasing function of @xmath35 at higher @xmath35 ( in the advection - dominated regime ) , opposite to the observed correlation .",
    "when the diffusivity in the convection zone is increased , the location of this turnover moves to a higher @xmath35 .",
    "our extensive analysis shows that this turnover corresponds to the transition between the diffusion and advection dominated regimes . in the diffusion - dominated regime ,",
    "faster circulation means less time for decay of the poloidal field , leading to a higher cycle amplitude , whereas in the advection - dominated regime diffusive decay is less important and a faster circulation means less time to induct toroidal field , thus generating a lower cycle amplitude .",
    "if the observed statistics of the past @xmath121 cycles as reported by @xcite reflect a true underlying trend , then our results imply that the solar dynamo is in fact working in a regime which is dominated by diffusive flux transport in the main body of the scz ( although the cycle period is still governed by the slow meridional circulation counterflow at the base of the scz ) .",
    "this conclusion supports the analysis of @xcite .    through a correlation analysis in a stochastically",
    "forced version of our model , we have also explored the persistence of memory in the solar cycle for both the diffusion - dominated and advection - dominated regimes .",
    "it is this memory mechanism which is understood to lead to predictive capabilities in @xmath0-@xmath1 dynamo models with spatially segregated source regions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 effects .",
    "this understanding is based on the finite time delay required for flux transport to communicate between these different source regions .",
    "we find that the polar field of cycle @xmath2 correlates strongest with the amplitude ( toroidal flux ) of cycle @xmath4 in both the regimes .",
    "in the diffusion - dominated regime this is the only significant correlation , indicative of a one - cycle memory only .",
    "however , in the advection - dominated case , there are also significant correlations with the amplitude of cycles @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast to the correlations that we infer , @xcite found that the strongest correlation in their advection dominated model was with a two - cycle time lag .",
    "since such correlations lead to predictive capabilities , and obviously seem to be model and parameter - dependent as suggested by our results , such a correlation analysis should be the first step towards any prediction , the latter being based on the former . in hindsight , however , both @xcite  who use an advection - dominated model and inputs from multiple previous cycles , and @xcite  who use a diffusion - dominated model and input from only the past cycle to predict the next cycle , appear to be have made the correct choices within their modelling assumptions .",
    "note that the memory mechanism in our advection - dominated case appears to have a different cause than that implied by @xcite , who invoke the survival of multiple old - cycle polar fields feeding into a new cycle toroidal field .",
    "all of the surviving correlations in our advection - dominated regime ( figure [ fig : coradv ] ) are positive ; they do not alternate in sign . this alternation in sign",
    "would be expected if bands of multiple older cycle poloidal field survive in the tachocline  odd and even cycle poloidal fields would obviously contribute oppositely because of their alternating signs . in that case",
    "we would expect the absolute value of @xmath117 to correlate positively with @xmath118 and @xmath120 and so on , but negatively with @xmath122 and @xmath123 and so on , as evident in the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  9 ; after accounting for the fact that they use signed magnetic fields ) . rather , in the advection - dominated regime of our model , the correlations appear to persist simply because fluctuations in field strength are passed on in both the poloidal - to - toroidal and toroidal - to - poloidal phases of the cycle , as evidenced by the correlation between amplitude and polar flux of cycle @xmath2 . in a recent analysis ,",
    "@xcite find that the predictive skill of a surface flux transport model  similar in spirit to the advection - dominated dynamo model of @xcite  is contained in the input information of sunspot areas in the declining phase of the cycle .",
    "they argue that memory of multiple past cycles , in the form of surviving bands of poloidal field ( its surface manifestations in their case ) , need not be the only reason behind the predictive capability of the advection - dominated dynamo model of @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the advection - dominated regime supports this suggestion of @xcite .",
    "coming back to the diffusion - dominated regime , our comparative analysis indicates that in this case , the memory of past cycles is governed by downward diffusion of poloidal field into the tachocline  which primarily results in a one - cycle memory . the fact that diffusion is an efficient means for transporting flux",
    "is often ignored , especially in this era of advection - dominated models ; however , we find that diffusive flux transport is quite efficient .",
    "the identification of this one cycle memory in our stochastically forced model contradicts @xcite  who claim that prediction is not possible in this regime .",
    "as long as the source regions are spatially segregated , and one of the source effects is observable and the other deterministic , flux transport @xmath0-@xmath1 dynamos will inherently have predictive skills no matter what physical process ( i.e. , circulation , or diffusion , or downward flux - pumping ) is invoked to couple the two regions .",
    "we may also point out that in the context of cycle - to - cycle correlations , downward flux pumping @xcite would have the same effect as diffusion in that it also acts to short - circuit the meridional circulation conveyor belt .",
    "so although downward flux pumping differs from diffusive transport because in the latter case the fields may reduce in strength due to decay , the overall persistence of memory is expected to be similar if diffusive flux transport was replaced or complemented by downward flux pumping .    in summary , our analysis has served both to explore the diffusion dominated and advection dominated regimes within the framework of a bl type dynamo , and to demonstrate how the memory of the dynamo may be different in these two regimes .",
    "based on our analysis we assert that diffusive flux transport in the scz plays an important role in flux transport dynamics , even if the dynamo cycle period is governed by the meridional flow speed .",
    "in fact , the observed solar cycle amplitude - period dependence may arise more naturally in the diffusion - dominated regime , as discussed earlier",
    ". taken together therefore , we may conclude that diffusive flux transport is a significant physical process in the dynamo mechanism and this process leads primarily to a one - cycle memory which may form the physical basis for solar cycle predictions , if other physical mechanisms involved in the complete dynamo chain of events are well understood .",
    "separate , detailed examinations of these other related physical mechanisms will be performed in the future .",
