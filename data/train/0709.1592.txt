    "<S> it is well - known that the electric and magnetic aharonov - bohm effects may be formally described on equal footing using the four - vector potential in a relativistic framework . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an illustrative manifestation of both effects in a single configuration , in which the specific path of the charged particle determines the weight of the electric and magnetic acquired relative phases . </S>",
    "<S> the phases can be distinctively obtained in the coulomb gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme manifests the pedagogical lesson that though each of the relative phases is gauge - dependent their sum is gauge - invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) @xcite effect is traditionally separated into two different effects : the electric ab effect and the more familiar magnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> these may be formally described on equal footing using the four - vector potential in a relativistic framework , where the acquired relative phase is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a physical manifestation of their simultaneous existence may in fact be achieved with a simple specific configuration in space - time . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we set forth such a manifestation , which enables vivid tangible understanding of the relationship between the two effects .    </S>",
    "<S> both the electric and the magnetic ab effects realize the significance of electromagnetic potentials on charged particles which travel through regions of space that are not simply connected . </S>",
    "<S> even if such particles encounter no electromagnetic fields in their paths , they may acquire a relative phase resulting in a shift in the interference pattern . </S>",
    "<S> in the electric effect , a charged particle s wave packet passes through a non - simply connected region , where it is split in two ; each of the two wave packets encounters a different scalar potential that can only depend on time . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no electric forces act on the particle . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase acquired is @xmath1 in gaussian units where we take @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> this effect may be physically realized in the following way : a charged particle s wave - packet starts on one side of a capacitor and is split so that one of the wave packets travels through the capacitor while the other goes in the opposite direction , as shown in figure [ el2]a . </S>",
    "<S> the capacitor is initially uncharged . </S>",
    "<S> we assume there is a little hole in the capacitor through which the wave packet travels undisturbed </S>",
    "<S> . then the capacitor is charged and discharged , and only afterwards the wave packets return together and interfere ( so that one of the wave packets travels again through the hole ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the wave packets are well apart from the boundaries of the capacitor ( or that the capacitor plates are infinite along the @xmath3 and @xmath4 axes ) and that the hole is small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , each of the wave packets travels through a region of zero electric field . actually , instead of charging and discharging the capacitor , we can just move the plates of a charged capacitor : initially , two oppositely charged plates are zero distance apart so that they totally cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> then the capacitor plates are moved apart and then together again in the @xmath5 direction . </S>",
    "<S> this setup is illustrated in figure [ el2]b .    in the magnetic ab effect , a charged particle s wave packet interferes around a confined magnetic flux , acquiring a relative phase of @xmath6 , where we take the magnetic susceptibility and the electric permittivity to be 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect may be physically realized using a long solenoid , as shown in figure [ mag2 ] :    our scheme is based on constructing a subspace in space - time in which the four - vector potential is non trivial . though the sources that yield the suggested potential depend on time , we arrange the setup to be non - radiating so that both the electric and magnetic fields vanish everywhere outside the source . </S>",
    "<S> when a charged particle s wave packet encounters such a potential , it acquires an ab phase both from the electric and magnetic effects , which depend on the particle s specific path in space - time @xmath7 . by expressing the potential in the coulomb gauge </S>",
    "<S> we see which part of the phase is electric and which is magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> this way we see how the electric and magnetic relative phases depend on different possible paths .    </S>",
    "<S> the setup that combines both effects is described in figure [ fig42 ] . </S>",
    "<S> assume that the two capacitor plates are infinite in the @xmath4 direction and zero distance apart in the @xmath5 direction . in the @xmath3 direction </S>",
    "<S> the plates are finite where the edges are located at @xmath8 and @xmath9 and we define @xmath10 . in addition , two infinitesimally thin and infinitely long solenoids ( fluxons ) are located on the edges of the capacitor ( along the @xmath4 axis ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependence of the setup is illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] . at @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the plates are instantaneously moved apart and then together again . at @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the same procedure again : the plates are instantaneously moved apart and then together again , but in the opposite direction ( as shown in the small graph in figure [ fig4 ] ) . in order to cancel out the resulting electromagnetic wave fronts , </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously send steady opposite currents through the two solenoids during the time - interval @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this choice of sudden changes in the charge and current densities is not essential and is used to simplify the calculations , as shall be explained later . </S>",
    "<S> as we now show , the suggested configuration describes a non - radiating source , which creates a non - simply connected topology in space - time . a charged particle that enters this finite volume in the @xmath15 plane acquires a phase from both the electric and magnetic effects .    </S>",
    "<S> first , consider a particle moving along path @xmath16 of figures [ fig42 ] and [ fig4 ] , which we regard as the `` electric path '' : at @xmath17 , its wave packet is located at @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath4 is arbitrary ( and will be omitted from now on ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet then splits in the @xmath5 direction , so that at @xmath11 , the two wave packets are located on both sides of the capacitor ; one is located at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and the other at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> then at @xmath25 the wave packets interfere at @xmath26 . as we shall later see the relative phase between the wave packets in this path is acquired from both the electric and magnetic effects .    </S>",
    "<S> second , consider a particle moving along path @xmath27 of figures [ fig42 ] and [ fig4 ] , which we regard as the `` magnetic path '' . at @xmath25 , its wave packet is located at @xmath28 where @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet then splits in the @xmath5 direction and travels in the @xmath3 direction . </S>",
    "<S> then the wave packets interfere , so that they close a loop around one of the fluxons well within the time interval @xmath30 $ ] . here again , the wave packets travel through a little hole in the capacitor , when the plates are zero distance apart . as we shall later see the relative phase in this path is acquired solely from the magnetic effect . </S>",
    "<S> +    one may ask what would be the relative phase acquired by wave packets that interfere without crossing the capacitor , as shown in path @xmath31 of figure [ fig43 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the relative phase should be only an electric one , since the two magnetic phases acquired by each of the opposite fluxons cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this setup no relative phase is acquired at all . </S>",
    "<S> this is explained in the following by choosing a specific gauge in which the four - vector potential vanishes along the path of the wave packets .    </S>",
    "<S> we continue by explicitly showing that this setup is indeed non - radiating and derive the relative phases . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> let us take @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the following singular vector potential : @xmath33\\big[\\theta(x)-\\theta(x - l)\\big]\\delta(y)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}},\\quad \\phi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the heaviside step function . </S>",
    "<S> note that even though there are sources in the suggested setup , we choose to fix @xmath35 to zero , so that the gauge is fixed as the temporal gauge . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 can be visualized as confined to the rectangle shown in figure [ fig4 ] , and pointing in the @xmath5 direction . </S>",
    "<S> we have imposed delta function @xmath37 thus making the potential singular purely for simplicity of calculations ; it is in no way an essential requirement @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we then see that both the electric and magnetic fields vanish everywhere outside the source given by @xmath36 : @xmath38\\big[\\theta(x)-\\theta(x\\!-\\!l)\\big]\\delta(y)\\hat{\\boldsymbol { y } } , \\\\&\\boldsymbol{b}=\\!\\frac{\\partial \\!a_y}{\\partial \\!x}\\!-\\!\\frac{\\partial a_x}{\\partial y}\\!=\\ ! \\pi\\!\\big[\\theta(t)\\!-\\!\\theta(t\\!-\\!t)\\big[\\!\\delta(x)\\!-\\!\\delta(x\\!-\\!l)\\big]\\delta(y)\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] the electric field appears momentarily at @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the magnetic field is constant during @xmath13 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the sources , charge and current densities , yielding the vector potential ( [ a ] ) can be easily found using the differential form of gauss law and the potential form of maxwell s equations ( corresponding to the current gauge ) : @xmath41    the resulting charge density is @xmath42\\big[\\theta(x)-\\theta(x - l)\\big]\\delta'(y).\\ ] ] we see that indeed the charge density corresponds to capacitor plates that are instantaneously moved apart and then together again in the @xmath5 direction both at @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( from the derivative of the delta function ) .    </S>",

    "<S> let us now separate the acquired phase into the electric phase and the magnetic phase . as ( [ a ] ) shows , the relative phase acquired when a charged particle s wave packet crosses @xmath49 is @xmath50\\big[\\theta(x)-\\theta(x - l)\\big],\\ ] ] which equals @xmath51 if the particle crosses the discussed topology ( figure [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phase may originate from the electric effect induced by the charges as well as the magnetic one induced by the solenoidal currents .    in order to explicitly obtain the electric and magnetic parts of the phase we transform to the coulomb gauge @xcite . in this gauge </S>",
    "<S> the scalar potential depends only on the charge density and the vector potential depends only on the transverse current density @xmath52 for which @xmath53 : @xcite @xmath54 therefore the electric and magnetic phases are clearly distinct in the coulomb gauge .    </S>",

    "<S> as @xmath79 increases , the electric phase becomes less dominant , while the magnetic phase becomes more dominant as their sum still equals @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in the electric phase can be physically explained by the fact that the capacitor is now finite . note that if @xmath80 , @xmath81 or both wave packets are located in the same side of the capacitor at @xmath39 , the electric and magnetic phases cancel . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if the wave packets interfere only after @xmath40 , the total phase is zero . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , let us examine wave packets that interfere in the `` magnetic path '' corresponding to path @xmath27 of figure [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it can easily be checked that wave packets that interfere around @xmath82 or @xmath83 ( not both ) well within @xmath13 $ ] acquire only a magnetic phase of @xmath51 . from the definition of the vector potential ( [ a ] ) </S>",
