    "various observations have confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that our galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , sagittarius  a@xmath0 ( sgr  a@xmath0 ) , with its mass of @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the solar mass ; see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "multi - wavelength observations of sgr  a@xmath0   reveal that its bolometric luminosity is @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the eddington luminosity ) , which is five orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by a standard thin disc accretion at the bondi accretion rate @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical efforts have been made accompanied by these observational progresses ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we now understand that an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) scenario works for sgr  a@xmath0 . in this model , the low luminosity is due to both the low radiative efficiency and the strong mass loss via wind of the adaf @xcite .",
    "sgr  a@xmath0  is thus an excellent laboratory for studying the accretion and ejection physics in such radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) , which are ubiquitous in the nearby universe .",
    "sgr  a@xmath0  is usually in a quiescent state , and occasionally interrupted by rapid flares ( on timescales @xmath5  hr ) , most significantly in x - ray @xcite and near - infrared ( nir ; @xcite ) .",
    "many such flares have been observed in various wavebands , including those detected by _",
    "( @xcite ) , _ xmm - newton _ ( @xcite ) , _ swift _ ( @xcite ) , and _ nustar _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "many have also been detected in nir ( @xcite ) , in sub - millimeter ( @xcite ) , and also in radio ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now briefly summarize the main properties of these multi - wavelength flares ( see also @xcite for a detailed summary of the general properties of the nir and x - ray flares from sgr  a@xmath0 ) .",
    "the flare rate is roughly two per day in x - ray @xcite and more frequently in nir .",
    "the nir and x - ray flares occur simultaneously within @xmath6 when both are observed in company ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite for a counter - example ) .",
    "the amplitude of the nir and x - ray flares can be @xmath7 and 160 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the nir flare profile is about 60 mins , which is about twice that of the x - ray .",
    "there are substructure variations with characteristic timescale of @xmath8 in the nir light curve occasionally , but not present at the same level in x - ray @xcite .",
    "the light curves of both x - ray and nir flares are roughly symmetric , but the brightest flare in @xcite shows remarkable asymmetry profile with a faster decline than rise .",
    "a large fraction of the x - ray flares in the xvp campaign also shows a faster rise and slow decay profile @xcite .",
    "the flares in the nir are significantly polarized with the typical polarization degrees of the order of @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray radiation of sgr  a@xmath0  is believed to have two distinctive states .",
    "one is a steady quiescent emission which is dominated by the radiation around the bondi radius , while the other is point - like flare emission arisen from the innermost region of the accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the x - ray flares look like to be large amplitude , short duration events overlayed in a flat baseline @xcite .",
    "however , it is less clear that such a conclusion can be applied to the nir emission .",
    "much of the nir variation could just represent the red noise of the underlying quiescent emission @xcite .",
    "flares flares in sub - millimeter and radio show much shallower and broader profiles than those in nir and x - ray .",
    "there is a general trend that the peak flare emission at a higher radio frequency leads that of a lower one , e.g. , 43 ghz leading 22 ghz by @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "time lags are also detected among radio , sub - millimeter and nir / x - ray @xcite .",
    "most theoretical works of flares focus on discussing the radiation mechanism of flares .",
    "the proposed flare models usually invoke synchrotron and/or inverse compton radiation processes .",
    "the highly polarized nir emission is the evidence for a synchrotron origin of the nir flares , produced by a population of non - thermal electrons ( e.g. , @xcite , see also references therein ) .",
    "the non - thermal electrons are likely accelerated by magnetic reconnection , shock or turbulence in either an accretion flow ( @xcite , and references therein ) or an assumed jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the suggested radiation mechanism for x - ray flares includes synchrotron @xcite , inverse compton scattering @xcite , or bremsstrahlung @xcite .",
    "continuous injections of a population of high - energy electrons are in general required for the synchrotron mechanism in order to balance the fast cooling of the x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "this may be a natural ingredient for the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) process , e.g. , magnetic reconnection considered in this work .    there",
    "do exist some theoretical models aimed to explain the physical origin of the flares , including accretion instabilities @xcite , orbiting hot spots @xcite , expanding plasma blobs @xcite , and tidal disruption of asteroids by the smbh @xcite .",
    "recently , modeling efforts have been focused on magnetic reconnection within the accretion flow and are usually based on the mhd numerical simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flares are produced by the radiation of non - thermal electrons accelerated in the reconnection .",
    "note that the ingredient of the invoked particle acceleration process in these modeling efforts ( including the present one ) have to be phenomenological in the sense that it is taken from other independent works , usually particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "one representative work is @xcite . in this work",
    ", they consider the synchrotron radiation from a population of non - thermal electrons transiently accelerated by an episodic magnetic reconnection occurred in the accretion flow .",
    "they assume time - dependent profiles for the injection rate and the magnetic field strength in the description of the non - thermal electron distribution evolution , which are responsible for the light curves of the nir and x - ray flares , as well as the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite find that x - ray variability could result from non - thermal electrons in localized highly magnetized regions , based on their general relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) simulations .",
    "all these existing works suggest that magnetic reconnection likely plays an important role in producing the nir , and especially x - ray flares .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose an alternative model for the flares of sgr a*. different from the works mentioned above , we assume that the flares are caused by magnetic reconnection occurred not in the main body of the accretion flow , but instead in the surface or the coronal region of the accretion flow .",
    "this work is a development of the mhd model for the formation of episodic jets proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model is analogous to the coronal mass ejection ( cme ) in the sun @xcite . whereas the work by @xcite focuses on the dynamics of the ejection of blobs from the black hole accretion flow , the present work moves a step further to model the associated radiation .",
    "the modeling is motivated by the following facts : first , based on a statistical analysis for x - ray flares of sgr  a@xmath0 , @xcite have shown that they are consistent with events from a three - dimensional self - organized criticality ( soc ) system , similar to solar flares , which are powered by magnetic reconnection in the surface of accretion flow .",
    "second , the detailed study to the solar flares over many years have shown that the powerful cmes are physically associated with the strong solar flares , i.e. , these flares and cmes are likely the different manifestations of the same physical process .",
    "in fact , the flare model to be presented in this work is similar to the standard model of solar flares .",
    "third , if flares seen in nir and x - ray are physically associated with those seen in radio , then we can naturally speculate that they are all linked to the plasmoid ejection process , as clearly indicated by the observed time lag in sgr  a@xmath0  between two different radio bands mentioned above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , extensive mhd numerical simulations of black hole accretion flows have led to the consensus that the hot accretion flow is enveloped by a tenuous corona ( see @xcite for a review ) , i.e , the structure of the hot accretion flow is similar to that of the sun .",
    "these facts provide us with the motivation to make the above analogy between the sun and the accretion flow .",
    "in fact , several works have been presented along the above line . without considering the dynamics of the ejection of a blob from the accretion flow , @xcite calculated the synchrotron radiation from such a blob , assuming some time - dependent profiles for the non - thermal electron injection .",
    "the results were then compared with the observed light curve and sed of the nir and x - ray flares in sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the emissions from the plasmoids with dynamics as described in the cme scenario for episodic jets .",
    "they considered special and general relativistic effects ( especially the gravitational lensing one ) , on the light curves , but without paying attention to the spectra .",
    "furthermore , @xcite applied a similar cme model to interpreting the giant flare of three magnetars by assuming the free magnetic energy released in an eruptive process to power the giant flare events .",
    "here , we present a time - dependent mhd model for the flares of sgr  a@xmath0  within the framework described by @xcite .",
    "we will calculate both the dynamics of the blob ejection and the corresponding radiation , including the light curves and spectrum of nir and x - ray flares . in a subsequent work ( li et al . in preparation ) , we will focus on the discussion of interpreting radio flares based on the same model .",
    "as we will see , the model can explain the observations quite well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our mhd model in section  2 .",
    "numerical results of our model and comparisons with observations are presented in section  3 .",
    "we discuss our results in section  4 and summarize the work in section  5 . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume that the smbh mass is @xmath11 and its distance is @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we calculate the dynamical evolution of plasmoids ejected from the coronal region of the accretion flow .",
    "our calculation starts with a newly formed plasmoid ( refer to fig . 1 , in which the closed shaded circle represents the core of the plasmoid ( also called flux rope ) ) .",
    "the formation process of the plasmoid is not specifically addressed here , but should be similar to the formation of the prominence in the solar corona , likely due to the thermal instability of the coronal gas .",
    "the full dynamical description of the system consists of two stages which are connected with a triggering process .",
    "while the details can be found in @xcite , here we briefly summarize the whole process .",
    "in the first stage , the plasmoid is in an equilibrium when there is a balance among the forces due to the magnetic compression , magnetic tension , and gravity .",
    "the foot points of the magnetic field lines are anchored in the accretion flow .",
    "the magnetic energy is gradually accumulated in the coronal magnetic field in response to the turbulent motion and differential rotation of the flow .",
    "the evolution of the system in this stage is ideal , which means that magnetic reconnection does not take place in the corona .",
    "the gradual evolution of the boundary conditions in the accretion flow will inevitably bring the plasmiod into a critical point when the total magnetic energy of the system reaches a threshold , after which further evolution causes the loss of equilibrium of the system initiated by the triggering process . in the second stage",
    ", the loss of the equilibrium leads to a catastrophic evolution of the plasmoid , during which most of stored free magnetic field energy are rapidly released due to the magnetic reconnection .",
    "it is thus this non - ideal mhd process in this stage that powers the radiative flares , and is our focus in the following calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows an illustration diagram for qualitatively describing the disrupting process .",
    "the bolded vertical line represents the current sheet , a neutral region separating magnetic field lines of opposite polarity .",
    "the motion of the flux rope is mainly subject to the gravity and magnetic forces @xcite .",
    "the gas pressure is assumed to be much smaller compared to the magnetic pressure in the coronal region , so it is negligible in this model .",
    "after the loss of the equilibrium , the flux rope is thrust outward and its motion is governed by    @xmath13    to the first order of approximation , where _ m _ is the total mass inside the flux rope per unit length , @xmath14 is its lorentz factor , _ h _ is the height of the flux rope from the surface of the accretion flow , @xmath15 is the total electric current intensity flowing inside the flux rope , @xmath16 is the total external magnetic field measured at the centre of the flux rope .",
    "the first term on the righthand side of equation  ( [ eq : fmg ] ) is the magnetic force and the second term @xmath17 is the gravitational force acting on the mass inside the flux rope , both of which will be given below .    in the zeroth - order approximation ,",
    "the following equations hold ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) : @xmath18@xmath19where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the electric current density and the magnetic field in the system , respectively .    in the cartesian coordinate system @xmath22",
    ", the @xmath23-axis is parallel to the equatorial plane of the accretion flow and @xmath24-axis points upward ( see also figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",

    "the corresponding vector potential function @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 knowing the magnetic field configuration of the system , we can derive the forces acting on the flux rope .",
    "the magnetic force , @xmath31 , can be expressed as @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\]]and the gravity , @xmath17 , is @xmath33where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the half - distance between the two field line footpoints anchored on the disc surface ( see figure  [ fig : diagram ] for the illustration of these parameters ) , the initial enclosed mass per unit length is @xmath37 in the flux rope , and is given by @xmath38 , @xmath39 the radius of the flux rope and usually @xmath40 is adopted according to the experience of the solar flares , @xmath41 the density ratio for the flux rope with respect to the background density @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , and @xmath44 is the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the first term in the square brackets on the righthand side of equation  ( [ eq : fm ] ) denotes the magnetic compression force , while the other two terms in the bracket represent the magnetic tension forces .",
    "it is this magnetic compression force that pushes the flux rope outwards ( upwards ) , and makes the catastrophic loss of equilibrium in the system possible . the magnetic tension and gravity force tends to pull the flux rope backwards ( downwards ) .",
    "the system is in equilibrium initially as they balance each other .",
    "when the compression term dominates over the two other ones , the system loses its equilibrium , and thrusts the flux rope outward in a catastrophic fashion .    the dynamic equation governing the motion of the flux rope can thus be deduced to @xmath45 -\\frac{g{m_{\\bullet } } \\gamma_{\\rm b}}{{{\\left ( { { r_0 } + h } \\right)}^2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    -axis is parrel to the equatorial plane of the accretion flow , and the @xmath24-axis points upward .",

    "we adopt a more realistic density distribution in the corona which is taken from a fully general relativistic three - dimensional mhd simulation of hot accretion flows @xcite .",
    "they found that the number density decreased exponentially with decreasing polar angle ( see figure 3 of that paper ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : den ] , the two density profiles differ slightly at the large height , but behave similarly in the lower latitude .",
    "our tests show that the final results for the light curve modeling are insensitive to the two different density profiles .",

    ", we align the light curves with their peak times . as the alfvn timescale @xmath201",
    ", it is shown that the rise and decline timescales decrease with increasing @xmath86 , which is due to the shorter alfvn timescale for the stronger magnetic field .",

    "the figure indicates that the flare luminosity is , however , anti - correlated with @xmath42 .",
    "this is because a lighter blob can be ejected to farther away from the accretion disc , which leads to a larger volume of reconnection region . to investigate the effect of the concentration parameter @xmath41 , we make @xmath202 a constant to fix the mass of the flux rope .",
    "the nir light curve is insensitive to @xmath41 .",
    "as shown in the middle left panel of figure  [ fig : irlc ] , the nir luminosity only slightly decreases with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "this is because an increase of @xmath41 ( or decrease of @xmath42 ) leads to a decrease of the normalization of power - law electrons while the dynamical properties of the flux rope remains the same with fixed @xmath202 .",
    "as we have stated previously , the parameter @xmath54 mainly affects the asymmetry magnitude of the light curve . a larger @xmath54 tends to result in a quasi - symmetric profile as shown in the middle right panel of figure  [ fig : irlc ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath200 is quite straightforward to understand , i.e. , changing the amplitude of the light curve as a whole , as shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : irlc ] . in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : irlc ] , we show the impact of the power - law index @xmath131 .",
    "it is obvious that a harder electron spectrum will lead to a weaker nir flare as well as a stronger x - ray one , as illustrated in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : xlc ] .",
    "the numerical parameter dependencies of the x - ray light curves are demonstrated in figure  [ fig : xlc ] . for most parameters ,",
    "the quantitative tendency of the x - ray flare luminosity is similar to the case of nir , but with a weaker dependency .",
    "this is due to the fact that the x - ray light curves is mainly determined by the injection profile @xmath192 and is not particularly sensitive to the magnetic field or the minimum lorentz factor of power - law electrons .",
    "the typical flare light curves we choose have comparable amplitudes in nir and x - ray .",
    "as we have reviewed in the introduction , not every nir flare has an x - ray counterpart .",
    "this observational fact can be explained by either a steeper electron power - law index ( as shown in the lower right panel of figures  [ fig : irlc ] and [ fig : xlc ] ) or a smaller maximum lorentz factor of electrons @xcite .",
    "the former could result in a very weak thus undetectable x - ray flare , while in the latter case , the synchrotron emission can not extend to the x - ray band during nir flaring activities in observation .",
    "an intriguing feature for our selected observations of the april 4 flare is the substructures in the nir light curve , which is not presented in the x - ray flare observed simultaneously .",
    "although some works suggest that the substructures in nir flares could be just statistical fluctuations in a red noise spectrum rather than intrinsic flare events @xcite , it is still interesting to explore the plausible physical mechanism responsible for them .",
    "@xcite suggest that this puzzling property is because of the different cooling rate responses of the nir and x - ray synchrotron - emitting electrons to the change of the magnetic field . in the synchrotron radiation model",
    ", small magnetic field fluctuations can produce the substructures observed in the nir .",
    "in contrast , a comparatively smooth shape may be expected in x - ray , because the x - ray emission depends primarily on the injection rate but not on the magnetic field .    during the magnetic reconnection",
    ", multiple plasmoids can be formed in the current sheet due to tearing of the current - sheet structure , as seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "when these plasmoids are ejected out from the current sheet , the resultant emission will have substructures in the light curves .",
    "this picture is also supported by two - dimensional particle - in - cell simulations of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "these simulations show a strong anisotropy of the particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection and energetic electrons are concentrated into several compact regions inside magnetic islands .",
    "the resultant synchrotron light curve of a flare comprises several bright sub - flares emitted by energetic beams of particles .",
    "the concentration of the accelerated electrons , which could take in action here in a similar environment , can thus be an alternative mechanism responsible for the substructures observed in the nir .",
    "@xcite observed that the peak flare emission at 43 ghz leads the 22 ghz peak flare by @xmath203 mins .",
    "they show that the time delay of the flare emission can be naturally interpreted in terms of the plasmon model of @xcite by considering the ejection and adiabatic expansion of a uniform , spherical plasma blob .",
    "this is fully consistent with our model that flare activities in sgr  a@xmath0  are associated with blob ejections . in @xcite",
    "the ejection of the blob is an assumption . in the present work ,",
    "we provide a dynamical interpretation for it . in the following ,",

    "the quantitative calculations based on our dynamical model will be presented in a subsequent work .    as the flux rope is ejected outward",
    ", the two flare regions ( flux rope and flare loop ) will begin to expand significantly .",
    "radio emission is produced by the synchrotron emission of relativistic electron in the flare region .",
    "the blob is initially optically thick due to the self - absorption of synchrotron emission . as the expansion of the blob , the self - absorption optical depth decreases .",
    "the luminosity will increase with the increasing blob surface area as long as it still remains optically thick .",
    "the light curve turns over once the blob becomes optically thin .",
    "the anti - correlation of the optical depth dependency on the frequency determines that the transition from optically thick to optically thin emissions occurs first for higher frequency .",
    "this results in the peak emission at 43 ghz leads that at 22 ghz . recently , @xcite reveal a frequency - dependent time lag relation where maxima at higher frequencies lead those at lower frequencies , indicating a moderately relativistic collimated outflow , which provides further evidence for this scenario .",
    "although our numerical modellings are focused on the typical light curves which have symmetric profile , there are many events showing asymmetric features .",
    "as we have denoted previously , @xmath54 can be used to a measurement of the magnitude of the profile asymmetry ; fast rise and slow decline light curves observed can be interpreted with @xmath204 , while @xmath205 might correspond to slow rise and fast decline profiles , which are already observed as the brightest flares in the xvp campaign @xcite .",
    "the high degree of polarization in nir is a consequence of the presence of a relatively ordered magnetic field enclosing the ejecta ( see figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) and the small optical depth in the substantially inflated plasmoid blobs .",
    "the quantitative discussion of this part will again be presented in the subsequent work .",
    "a high degree of polarization for x - ray flares should also be expected due to the same nature as the nir flares in our model .",
    "such a scenario can thus be tested by the near future x - ray polarimetry , such as _ enhanced x - ray timing and polarimetry mission _ ( _ extp _ ) .",
    "we have developed an analytical mhd model for sgr  a@xmath0  flares .",
    "this work is a development of the @xcite model , which proposed a general scenario for both the formation of episodic ejection of plasmoids from the accretion flow and the associated radiative flares .",
    "the model is analogous with the catastrophe model of solar flares and cmes @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the analogy between black hole flares and the solar flares is based on the similarity of the structure between the accretion flow and the sun @xcite .",
    "it is further supported by the recent statistical study of x - ray flares , which indicates that they are in a self - organized criticality state driven by magnetic reconnection occurred in the surface of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the basic scenario is briefly summarized as follows .",
    "the starting point is a flux rope located in the corona of the accretion flow .",
    "the flux rope is anchored to the accretion flow by the magnetic field lines and is in an equilibrium state initially , balanced by gravity , magnetic tension and pressure forces .",
    "the magnetic field lines are controlled by the motion of the accretion flow which is differentially rotating and turbulent .",
    "therefore , magnetic energy and helicity is gradually accumulated with time in the system and eventually reaches a threshold .",
    "then the equilibrium of the flux rope is broken down and the flux rope is thrust outwards rapidly .",
    "consequently , the magnetic field lines below the flux rope come close enough and reconnection occurs .",
    "magnetic energy is released in this process and converted into the energy of thermal and power - law electrons .",
    "these energetic electrons flow into the flux rope and the magnetic loops where they then emit strong radiation by synchrotron radiation .",
    "this can explain the observed flares .",
    "such a scenario makes the radiative flares appears to be associated with expanding hot spots close to the black hole , which could be tested by future observations .",
    "the schematic figure of the process is shown in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .    by assuming some spacial distribution of the magnetic field and density in the coronal region , we have performed numerical calculations to the above - mentioned processes .",
    "we have calculated the dynamical evolution of the height of flux rope ( figure  [ fig : dyn ] ) , the alfven speed ( figure  [ fig : va ] ) , expansion of the flux rope ( figure  [ fig : ad ] ) , the magnetic field close to the reconnection region ( figure  [ fig : magb ] ) , the released energy in the reconnection ( figure  [ fig : edot ] ) , and the minimum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons ( figure  [ fig : cinj ] ) . based on these dynamical evolution , we have calculated the evolution of the energy distribution of accelerated electrons in the current sheet ( figure  [ fig : ne ] ) , and further the radiation of electrons .",
    "the calculated results are then compared with light curves and sed observed on april 4 , 2007 ( figures  [ fig : lc ] & [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "our numerical results show that the flux rope ejected from the surface of the accretion flow can be accelerated to mildly relativistic velocity within @xmath206 after the loss of equilibrium . with the relatively large alfvn mach number @xmath54",
    ", the reconnection of the current sheet can be very efficient and thus the bottom and top tips of the current sheet are rather close to each other .",
    "( figure  [ fig : dyn ] ) . as the reconnection proceeds , large amounts of the energy flux and particles are brought into the current sheet , and then ejected upwards and downwards .",
    "one half of the poynting flux and energetic electrons are flowing into the flux rope and the flare loop , where flaring activities take place . with the appropriate parameters adopted , we find that the total power by the magnetic reconnection can be @xmath207 , and the particle injection rate flowing into the flare regions is @xmath208 ( figure  [ fig : edot ] ) .",
    "the radiative efficiency is thus only @xmath188 for the resultant luminosity of @xmath209 .",
    "our calculation results can reasonably explain the main observations of flares , including their ir and x - ray light curves ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) and the spectra ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) . the model can also explain why nir and x - ray flares occur simultaneously once both of them occur but only part of the nir flares have corresponding x - ray counterparts .",
    "the scenario of an expanding radio - emitting blob can also naturally explain the observed time lag between the two light curves at two radio frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quantitative calculation , together with the interpretation of the observed nir polarization will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "our model also predicates a high degree of polarization for x - ray flares , which can be verified by the near future x - ray polarimetry , e.g. , _ extp_.",
