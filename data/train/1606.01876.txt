    "the homomorphism from @xmath55-head to @xmath56-socle is trivial so these operations commute .",
    "hence @xmath360 but @xmath361 as well so , using definition [ def : crystal ] , @xmath362 .",
    "[ th : iscrystal ] @xmath14 is a realization of @xmath1 .    by proposition [ lem : pcc ]",
    "it remains to check the conditions of proposition [ prop : comb - characterizaton2 ] .",
    "condition is immediate , is clear from lemma [ lem : tcb ] , and , , , are proposition [ prop : scc ] .",
    "consider the modulated graph from example [ ex : c2-intro ] , where @xmath363 and @xmath88 . in this case",
    "@xmath104 is representation - finite , and each indecomposable representation can be uniquely identified by its socle filtration , which we record from right to left .",
    "so , for example , @xmath364 means the unique indecomposable with a copy of the simple @xmath91 over vertex @xmath365 in its head , and two copies of the simple @xmath90 over vertex @xmath98 in its socle .",
    "the isomorphism classes of indecomposable @xmath104-modules are listed in figure [ fig : indecomposables ] .    to see that there are no other indecomposables , first check that @xmath366 and @xmath367 are the indecomposable projectives .",
    "next fix some module @xmath105 . if an element of @xmath368 acts non - trivially on some @xmath369 , it is easy to see that the sub - module generated by @xmath370 is isomorphic to @xmath367 , and hence occurs as a direct summand . similarly , if an element of @xmath371 acts non - trivially on some @xmath372 , then the submodule generated by @xmath370 is isomorphic to @xmath366 , so is a summand . if there are no such elements then @xmath105 is a direct sum @xmath373 , where @xmath374 , and @xmath375 , and these are easy to analyze .    in each irreducible component of @xmath207 ,",
    "the isomorphism class of the corresponding representation is constant on an open - dense set .",
    "the classes that show up this way are exactly the rigid representations : ones where no two indecomposables in the krull - schmidt decomposition admit a non - trivial extension .",
    "hence the irreducible components of @xmath207 correspond to collections of indecomposables none of which are connected by lines in figure [ fig : indecomposables ] , whose total dimension in @xmath149 . for example , the number of kostant partitions of @xmath376 is 5 , so the results above imply there must be 5 irreducible components of @xmath377 .",
    "the corresponding rigid modules are : @xmath378 unfortunately , @xmath104 usually has infinitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations , even in finite type , so this method does not generalize .",
    "dlab and ringel s construction need not agree with lusztig s even when all the @xmath60 are chosen to be @xmath91 .",
    "such an example is given in @xcite for @xmath381 , @xmath382 .",
    "here we give an example for @xmath380 .",
    "consider the graph where @xmath383 and @xmath53 consists of a single edge joining 1 and 2 .",
    "choose @xmath384 , and @xmath385 , with the actions of both @xmath386 and @xmath387 being scalar multiplication on both bimodules .",
    "the corresponding cartan matrix is of type @xmath380 .",
    "define @xmath388    fix a graded vector space @xmath389 .",
    "for any @xmath390 , consider the four maps    * @xmath391 in @xmath392 , * @xmath393 in @xmath394 .",
    "these determine @xmath246 , and the preprojective relations are @xmath395 take @xmath396 and @xmath397 to both be one dimensional , with bases @xmath398 respectively . define @xmath399 these satisfy , so define a module for @xmath104 .",
    "now take a second copy @xmath400 of this module with basis vectors @xmath401 .",
    "any extension of @xmath105 by @xmath400 is determined by @xmath402 defined by @xmath403 the preprojective relations give @xmath404 the only solution is @xmath405 , so any such extension has a two - dimensional head .",
    "a simple calculation shows that , for lusztig s preprojective algebra of type @xmath380 , any indecomposable @xmath105 that fits into a short exact sequence @xmath406 has a self - extension with a 1-dimensional head .",
    "hence , with the above choices , dlab and ringel s preprojective algebra is not isomorphic to lusztig s .",
    "it can still be used in our realization of @xmath1 , so our results generalize existing literature even in symmetric types .",
    "note also that lemma [ lem : cbf ] fails here if both modules are taken to be @xmath105 , since @xmath407    there is actually a family of preprojective algebras parameterized by @xmath408 defined as above but with @xmath409 if @xmath410 this is lusztig s preprojective algebra , but for all @xmath411 the above argument shows that it is not .",
    "hence dlab and ringel s construction can be thought of as non - trivially deforming lusztig s preprojective algebra in this case .",
    "there are many possible future directions for this work . essentially , for every result",
    "proven using or about lusztig s quiver varieties , one can ask if it can be extended to our generality . here",
    "we briefly discuss a few examples .      here",
    "we only consider the crystal @xmath412 , but in symmetric types one can also realize @xmath413 using a convolution product on constructible functions on lusztig s quiver varieties .",
    "can one extend this to our quiver varieties , and hence define semi - canonical bases in full generality ?",
    "even more ambitiously , can one use some version of perverse sheaves built from modulated quivers to study canonical bases in non - symmetric types ? there seem to be some obstacles .",
    "one approach would be to modify our construction to work over algebraically closed fields , since many geometric techniques work better in that setting , but this would require some new ideas ( for instance , example [ 2.7 ] shows that naively base - changing to @xmath379 would give the wrong number of irreducible components ) . geiss - leclerc - schrer @xcite",
    "have another approach to non - symmetric preprojective algebras which works over algebraically closed fields , so perhaps the first step would be to better understand how our work is related to their construction .      in @xcite ,",
    "saito uses irreducible components of nakajima s quiver varieties to realize the integrable highest weight crystals @xmath414 in symmetric types .",
    "it should be possible to extend this to non - symmetric types by extending our construction to include nakajima s varieties .      in types",
