    "there is substantial evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) of mass @xmath0 exist and are the engines that power active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars ( rees 1998 , 2001 ; macchetto 1999 ) .",
    "there is also ample evidence that smbhs reside at the centers of many , and perhaps most , galaxies ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1999 ) , including the milky way ( genzel et al . 1997 ; ghez et al . 2000 ; schdel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "since quasars have been discovered out to redshift @xmath1 ( fan et al . 2000 , 2001 )",
    ", the first smbhs must have formed by @xmath2 , or within @xmath3 yrs after the big bang .",
    "however , the cosmological origin of smbhs is not known .",
    "this issue remains one of the crucial , unresolved components of structure formation in the early universe .",
    "gravitationally , black holes are strong - field objects whose properties are governed by einstein s theory of relativistic gravitation  general relativity .",
    "general relativistic simulations of gravitational collapse to black holes therefore may help reveal how , when and where smbhs , or their seeds , form in the universe .",
    "simulating plausible paths by which the first seed black holes may have arisen is the underlying motivation of our investigation ( see fig .  [ eins ] ) .",
    "various routes have been proposed over the years by which smbhs or their seeds might arise by conventional physical processes ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 in rees 1984 ) .",
    "some routes are hydrodynamical in nature , such as the formation and collapse of supermassive stars ( smss ) , while others are stellar dynamical , like the evolution and collapse of collisionless clusters .",
    "the boltzmann equation provides a common mathematical framework for comparing competing scenarios : @xmath4 in equation  ( [ boltz ] ) @xmath5 is the phase - space distribution function for the matter , which might be in the form of a gaseous fluid , collisionless particles , and/or stars .",
    "the left - hand side of the equation represents the total time derivative of @xmath5 following a matter element along its trajectory in phase space .",
    "the right - hand side describes the role of collisions in modifying the phase - space distribution along the trajectory . to treat different scenarios the boltzmann equation",
    "must be solved in different physical regimes , all of which share gravitation as the the dominant long - range interaction .",
    "table 1.1 summarizes some of the smbh formation simulations that we have performed in recent years .",
    "typically , every scenario falls into one of three distinct regimes . in the vlasov ( collisionless boltzmann )",
    "regime the dynamical timescale of the system , @xmath6 , which is the time for matter to cross from one side of the system to the other , as well as the time to achieve virial equilibrium by violent relaxation , is much shorter than the relaxation timescale @xmath7 , the time for the system to reach thermal equilibrium via collisions . in pure vlasov simulations the integration time @xmath8 may exceed @xmath6 but always remains much shorter than @xmath7 .",
    "in such cases collisions can be ignored .",
    "the system can be evolved to dynamical ( virial ) equilibrium , but not thermal equilibrium . in the secularly collisional regime",
    ", @xmath6 again is much shorter than @xmath7 but the integration time is now much longer than @xmath7 . here",
    "collisions are crucial in driving the quasi - stationary evolution of the virialized system .",
    "since the timescale for collisions remains much longer than the dynamical timescale , collisions can often be handled perturbatively by tracking the secular drift of the system from one , nearly collisionless , virialized state to the next .",
    "this is the approach adopted in the fokker - planck approximation to the boltzmann equation . in the collision - dominated regime",
    ", @xmath7 is much shorter than @xmath6 and the system behaves as a fluid .",
    "this regime embraces all of hydrodynamics .            at selected times during the collapse described in figure  [ prof ] .",
    "the cluster does not evolve appreciably after @xmath9 .",
    "the circle in the last frame shows the black hole event horizon at @xmath10 .",
    "( from shapiro & teukolsky 1986.),width=377 ]      one possibility may involve the `` gravothermal catastrophe , '' the runaway core contraction on a relaxation timescale of a stable , virialized cluster due to the perturbative influence of collisions ( chandrasekhar 1942 ; lynden - bell & wood 1968 ; see spitzer 1975 , 1987 and lightman & shapiro 1978 for reviews and references ) .",
    "collisional scattering is a source of kinetic energy transport ( heat conduction ) .",
    "self - gravitating , nearly collisionless clusters with @xmath11 have negative heat capacity : as their high - temperature cores lose energy to their low - temperature halos by heat conduction , the cores contract and , in accord with the virial theorem , become hotter still , leading to a thermal runaway .",
    "the result is that the clusters undergo homologous core contraction ( lynden - bell & eggleton 1980 ) , as depicted in figure  [ gravo ] for newtonian clusters composed of identical particles .",
    "contraction to a singular state is complete in a time @xmath12 , where the central relaxation timescale @xmath13 is measured from an arbitrary initial time @xmath14 ( cohn 1979 ) .",
    "specifically , as @xmath15 , the central density as well as the the central redshift , potential and velocity dispersion ( temperature ) all blow up : @xmath16 and @xmath17 . at the same time",
    "the core radius and mass both shrink : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the required number of relaxation timescales to reach this singular state , as well as the @xmath20 fall - off in the halo density profile , are nearly independent of the velocity dependence of the collision cross section ( balberg & shapiro , unpublished ) .",
    "this gravothermal catastrophe can , in principle , drive a core to a highly relativistic state , at which point it could become dynamically unstable to catastrophic collapse on a dynamical timescale .        here",
    "we describe simulations involving the evolution of clusters of compact stars ( neutron stars or stellar - mass black holes ) and the build - up of massive black holes .",
    "this route has been discussed by several authors ( e.g. , zeldovich & podurets 1965 ; rees 1984 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1985c ; quinlan & shapiro 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "we briefly summarize below the key results of the multi - mass fokker - planck calculations of quinlan & shapiro ( 1989 ) .    consider a dense cluster of compact stars composed initially of identical neutron stars or black holes of mass @xmath21 in virial equilibrium .",
    "take the central mass density to be @xmath22 and the central velocity dispersion to be @xmath23 . here",
    "gravothermal evolution is driven by the cumulative effect of repeated , distant , small - angle , gravitational ( coulomb ) scatterings between the stars .",
    "binary formation is significant and is dominated by dissipative , 2-body capture by gravitational radiation .",
    "the simulations reveal that mass segregation causes significant departures from single - component homological evolution models . for example",
    ", @xmath24 does not increase at the center and the cluster is not driven to a relativistic state .",
    "however , there is an inevitable build - up of massive bhs via successive binary mergers .",
    "the evolution is followed up to the formation of bhs of mass @xmath25 , at which point the number of stars in the core become sufficiently small that the fokker - planck treatment breaks down .",
    "the intermediate mass bh binaries produced in this scenario would be prime sources of gravitational waves for the ground - based network of laser interferometers now under construction ( ligo , virgo , geo , and tama ) and for the space - based interferometer currently being designed ( lisa ) .",
    "here we discuss simulations that start from more typical initial conditions .",
    "these calculations treat the gravothermal evolution of a dense cluster of ordinary , main - sequence stars ( spitzer & saslaw 1966 ; colgate 1967 ; sanders 1970 ; begelman & rees 1978 ; lee 1987 ; quinlan & shapiro 1990 ; gao et al .",
    "1991 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "here we briefly summarize the multi - mass fokker - planck calculations of quinlan & shapiro ( 1990 ) , which are among the most detailed for galactic nuclei that do not assume the presence of a smbh _ a priori_.    consider a dense galactic nucleus initially consisting of main - sequence stars with mass @xmath26 in virial equilibrium . take the central mass density to be in the range @xmath27 and",
    "the central velocity dispersion to be in the range @xmath28 .",
    "this velocity is below the escape velocity from the surface of the stars , so that collisions will lead to mergers and not disruptions .",
    "collisions and mergers , stellar evolution and the formation of new stars from gas liberated by supernovae are included in the calculation , as are the formation of binaries by 3-body encounters and the interaction between hard binaries and single stars .",
    "all of this activity takes place in the context of the gravothermal evolution of the cluster , which again is driven by the cumulative effect of repeated , distant , small - angle , gravitational scattering of the stars .",
    "the outcome of the evolution is that stars with @xmath29 form easily , then merge and collapse to form seed bhs with masses @xmath30 in a time @xmath31 .",
    "the end result is the formation of a dense cluster of compact remnants comprised of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "the cluster is characterized by frequent binary mergers ( @xmath32 per year when integrated throughout the visible universe of @xmath33 galaxies ) .",
    "these intermediate mass black hole binaries are again promising sources of gravitational waves for the ground - based laser interferometers like ligo and for the proposed space - based interferometer lisa .",
    "dark matter comprises about @xmath34 of the matter in the universe .",
    "the simplest description of dark matter which accounts for many features of the large - scale structure of the universe is the `` cold dark matter '' ( cdm ) model , in which the dark matter particles are essentially collisionless .",
    "however , the possibility that dark matter particles interact with each other strongly and have a substantial scattering cross section has been revived recently ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) to explain several observations of dark matter structures on the order of @xmath35 .",
    "dynamical studies confirm that halos formed from such `` self - interacting '' dark matter ( sidm ) have flatter density cores in better agreement with the observations than the more cuspy profiles predicted by standard cdm .",
    "and successive profiles with higher central densities correspond to later times .",
    "bifurcation into a fluid inner core and a collisionless outer core is evident at late times .",
    "( from balberg et al .",
    "2002.),width=264 ]    balberg & shapiro ( 2002 ) have recently demonstrated that smbh formation may be an inevitable consequence of dynamical core collapse following the gravothermal catastrophe in sidm halos .",
    "this conclusion follows from their earlier dynamical study ( balberg et al .",
    "2002 ) which tracked the gravothermal evolution of a virialized , spherical sidm halo by employing the fluid formalism of lynden - bell & eggleton ( 1980 ) . in the early universe , halos form with a press - schechter ( 1974 ) distribution .",
    "typical halos are characterized by a central mass density @xmath36 , a central velocity dispersion @xmath37 and an elastic scattering cross section @xmath38 .",
    "the ratio of the scattering mean free path @xmath39 to the gravitational scale height @xmath40 everywhere satisfies the long mean free path inequality @xmath41 initially .",
    "this results in homologous gravothermal contraction at first ( see fig .",
    "[ gravo ] ) . however , in sidm halos the interactions are large - angle scatterings between close neighbors , not cumulative , small - angle coulomb scatterings by distant particles , as in star clusters .",
    "consequently , in contrast to star clusters , the inner core of an sidm halo evolves into the short mean free path ( fluid ) regime where @xmath42 .",
    "there is a bifurcation of the halo into a fluid inner core surrounded by a collisionless outer core and halo ( see fig .",
    "[ sidm ] ) . continued heat conduction out of the inner core drives it to a relativistic state , which eventually becomes unstable to collapse to a black hole .",
    "the initial mass of the black hole will be @xmath43 of the total mass of the halo .",
    "very massive sidm halos form smbhs with masses @xmath44 directly . smaller halos believed to form by redshift @xmath45 produce seed black holes of mass @xmath46 which can merge and/or accrete to reach the observed smbh range . significantly",
    ", this scenario for smbh formation requires no baryons , no prior star formation and no other black hole seed mechanisms ( cf .",
    "ostriker 2000 ; hennawi & ostriker 2002 ) .      relativistic gravitation  general relativity  induces a dynamical , radial instability to collapse in _ all _  forms of self - gravitating matter whenever the matter becomes sufficiently compact .",
    "plausible scenarios have been proposed that can trigger this instability to form smbhs or their seeds .",
    "smbhs are believed to reside at the centers of quasars , agns , and many , if not all , normal galaxies with bulges , including the milky way . according to recent observations",
    ", even globular clusters may contain black holes of intermediate mass @xmath47 ( gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ; gerssen et al .",
    "2002 ) , although alternative interpretations have been proposed ( baumgardt et al . 2003 ) .",
    "explaining the origin of smbhs is thus a fundamental , unresolved issue of modern cosmology and structure formation .",
    "some of the scenarios proposed for forming smbhs are `` hydrodynamical '' in nature , as in the collapse of fluid smss to smbhs .",
    "some of them are `` stellar dynamical , '' as in the collapse of a relativistic cluster of collisionless particles or compact stars .",
    "still others are `` hybrids , '' as in the case of the collapse of massive stars , built - up by collisions and binary mergers in dense clusters undergoing gravothermal contraction ; or the case of the collapse of the fluid inner core of an sidm halo , following its gravothermal contraction to a relativistic state .",
    "the challenge in exploring the competing scenarios is that the different physical regimes characterizing them are described by very different sets of equations , requiring very different numerical techniques for solution . yet",
    "numerical simulations have begun to explore many of the proposed routes .    at the present time",
    "we do not know for certain what is the dominant route by which observed smbhs are formed : are they born supermassive , or do they grow supermassive from small seeds ? do the seed black holes grow by merger , by gas accretion or both ?",
    "do the first black holes arise from the collapse of ordinary baryonic matter , collisionless dark matter , or from some more exotic form of mass - energy ( e.g. , scalar fields ? gravitational waves ? ) .",
    "the growth of black hole seeds by gas accretion is supported by the consistency between the total energy density in qso light and the bh mass density in local galaxies , adopting a reasonable accretion rest - mass  to  energy conversion efficiency ( soltan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "but quasars have been discovered out to redshift @xmath48 , so it follows that the first smbhs must have formed by @xmath2 or within @xmath3 yr after the big bang .",
    "this timescale provides a tight constraint on smbh formation .",
    "for example , if smbhs indeed grew by accretion , black hole seeds of mass @xmath49 must have formed by @xmath50 to have had sufficient time to reach a mass of @xmath51 by @xmath48 ( gnedin 2001 ) .",
    "the correlations @xmath52 ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) and @xmath53 ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) inferred for galaxies provide important additional constraints .",
    "for example , smbh formation by mergers of smaller seed holes during the hierarchical build - up of galaxies can account for these scaling laws ( haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) .",
    "but some observations suggest that smbhs spin rapidly .",
    "this conclusion might restrict the significance of merger scenarios , since black holes are typically spun down by repeated mergers ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) . on the other hand , a single final merger with a binary companion of comparable mass could drive the spin of a black hole back up to a large value .",
    "further observations , including the detection of gravitational waves from distant coalescing black hole binaries , might establish the evolutionary tracts and merging histories of smbhs and help identify their principle formation mechanism ."
