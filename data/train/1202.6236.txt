    "`` extended sf '' is often defined as merely a fraction of mir or hydrogen recombination line emission coming from outside a given nuclear region , and as such it could mean either truly diffuse sf , or rather one or more widely off - nuclear , but clearly localised starbursts .",
    "this latter scenario is playing out for example in the well - studied closest gas - rich merger system , the antennae , where the sf is dominated by an overlap region between the main nuclei .",
    "to study the physics of such cases in detail , including disentangling various kinematic components , requires high spatial resolution , which has not often been available except for a handful of local galaxies , .",
    "we are conducting an ongoing large survey of lirgs and ulirgs using adaptive optics nir imaging mainly with vlt / naco , and also gemini / altair / niri .",
    "both instruments deliver images with a spatial resolution of @xmath4  .",
    "the data are very well complemented with existing hst optical data for many of the targets , and there is also an on - going optical spectroscopic campaign with salt / rss .",
    "the galaxies are at distances ranging from 40 to 180 mpc , span the range from starbursts to lirgs , and are at various stages of merging , interaction , or isolation .",
    "some galaxies have been studied in more detail already  here we will present analysis of two such objects , and will finish with a brief discussion of some initial results from the larger sample .",

    "optically it is classified as barred and interacting ( fig .  1 ) , and as a borderline case between a liner and hii - dominated galaxy .",
    "it has also been classified as a composite starburst + agn .",
    "previous studies have identified a strong nuclear star forming ring of approximately 600 pc diameter ( kotilainen et al 2001 ; alonso - herrero et al .",

    "2005 ; daz - santos et al .",
    "2008 ) , we find the central kpc of ngc  1614 to be consistent with the following scenario : the core has experienced a starburst some 20 to 100 myr ago , has no more ongoing sf and much of the initial ism has evacuated the region .",
    "the ring at 300 pc radius is the site of strongest current sf , and the age of the sf is continuously decreasing as one moves outwards from the core to mid - ring , judging by the change of the pah - to - pa@xmath12 ratio .",
    "this ratio grows again outward of the ring , but there the level of star - formation is likely ( still ) too low to be detected in recombination lines , while the strong pah ew might instead be a signal of the very youngest sf ( 2 - 4 myr time scale ; beiro et al 2009 ) .",
    "it thus appears that ngc  1614 is experiencing an outward propagating starburst , the detected pah ring highlighting the location where the sf is just propagating into the `` new '' molecular gas clouds .",

    "2009 ) , this feature is consistent with a remnant of a smaller spiral galaxy which is now falling towards the main component for the second time , and has likely lost much of its mass , and perhaps is the source of the whole linear tidal tail .",
    "the timescales would put the first passage somewhere at 50 myr in the past , consistent with the estimates of the age of the central starburst .",

    "( u)lirgs are complicated dusty objects , and optical data alone , even of high spatial resolution , often can miss whole nuclei and major components of the interaction ( fig .  4 . ; see also haan et al .",
