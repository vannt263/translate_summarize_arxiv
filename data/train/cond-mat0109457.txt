    "the study of phase ordering kinetics has become a testbed for new complex fluid simulation methods . despite intensive analysis by many methods",
    ", it remains a field in which many interesting and fundamental questions go unanswered .",
    "constructing a model which correctly includes hydrodynamics but which is computationally simple enough to reach late times is a major theoretical challenge .",
    "new mesoscale models such as lattice gas ( lg )  @xcite , lattice boltzmann ( lb )  @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite , and boltzmann - vlasov  @xcite treatments have been crucial in increasing our understanding of these systems over the past decade .",
    "such methods require significantly smaller computational resources than earlier molecular dynamics ( md ) and cahn - hilliard approaches , and can therefore access more easily the late time regime in which hydrodynamics plays an important role .",
    "a much studied system which exhibits hydrodynamic influences on phase segregation is a @xmath2 mixture of immiscible fluids quenched into the two phase region of its phase diagram ( a so - called _ critical _ quench ) .",
    "such a system undergoes spinodal decomposition , where initially bicontinuous domain structure coarsens by surface - tension driven flows .",
    "spinodal decomposition elicits much interest because of its fundamental and industrial importance .",
    "for example , the mechanical properties of alloys depend on the dynamics of the phase separation process . despite extensive theoretical  @xcite ,",
    "numerical  @xcite and experimental investigation  @xcite some doubt remains about the true asymptotic late time growth behaviour of these systems .",
    "the dynamics of phase segregation in binary immiscible fluids are also dependent on the composition of the mixture .",
    "mixtures which do not have a @xmath2 ratio of the species ( so - called _ off - critical _ quenches ) are much less studied than their critical counterparts .",
    "as the quantity of the minority phase decreases , the domain structure ceases to be bicontinuous , so that nucleation and coalescence of droplets dominate the coarsening mechanism .",
    "the addition of surfactant to a system of binary immiscible fluids radically alters the equilibrium properties and growth dynamics of such mixtures  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the adsorption of surfactant ( amphiphilic ) molecules at oil - water interfaces leads to a dramatic reduction in the interfacial tension .",
    "this property is the origin of much industrial interest in surfactant systems .",
    "only recently have computational techniques and sufficiently powerful parallel platforms become available which permit numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of amphiphilic fluids in three dimensions .",
    "our hydrodynamic lattice gas model has recently been implemented in three dimensions , and its ability to reproduce many important phenomenological features of amphiphilic systems confirmed  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate this model s ability to capture quantitative features of the dynamics of binary immiscible and ternary amphiphilic fluids .",
    "continuum approaches regard spinodal decomposition as a solution of the equations of motion for two phase flow .",
    "these are given by the navier - stokes equation within each phase , and by boundary conditions at the interfaces .",
    "the incompressible navier - stokes equations are , for each fluid phase : @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fluid velocity , @xmath6 is the shear viscosity and @xmath7 is the scalar pressure .",
    "the first boundary condition is that the velocity of the two phases must match that of the interface : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the interface normal and @xmath10 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the velocities of phase @xmath12 and @xmath13 at the interface , and the velocity of the interface itself .",
    "the second boundary condition requires that the stress difference at the interface is balanced by the interfacial tension : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the stress tensor in phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the two principal radii of the interfaces and @xmath19 is the interfacial tension .    clearly , a numerical integration scheme for the above equations would be of enormous computational complexity . in order to obtain a numerical model which captures the essential physics in a computationally tractable way , an alternative approach is required .",
    "remaining with a phenomenological description of the fluid system , it is convenient to define a scalar _ order parameter _",
    "@xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the densities of oil and water at position @xmath24 .",
    "one may then write a cahn - hilliard equation for the evolution of the order parameter : @xmath25 and , @xmath26 and @xmath27.\\ ] ] this equation is coupled to the navier - stokes equations through a forcing term proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are gaussian noise fields satisfying an appropriate fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite .",
    "the equations  ( [ eq : orderparam ]  -  [ eq : ns2 ] ) define a model for immiscible fluid dynamics commonly referred to as model h. this model enables one to obtain the scaling regimes for critical spinodal decomposition by dimensional analysis .",
    "the _ viscous _ regime is obtained when one may neglect the inertial terms on the left hand side of equation  ( [ eq : ns2 ] ) ; then , balancing the forcing terms by the viscous terms one obtains : @xmath31 the _ inertial _ regime is obtained by balancing the forcing terms @xmath32 by the inertial terms in eqn  ( [ eq : ns ] ) : @xmath33 equating these two regimes implies that the crossover from viscous to inertial scaling occurs at @xmath34 .",
    "however , no three - dimensional simulation method so far developed can reach a sufficient range of length and timescales to observe both viscous and inertial regimes in a single simulation . the work of jury _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and kendon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite overcomes this difficulty by introducing scaling variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 which enable data from separate simulations to be combined .",
    "if the only physical effects involved in critical spinodal decomposition are capillary forces , viscous dissipation and fluid inertia , then the parameters governing domain growth are the surface tension @xmath19 , fluid mass density @xmath37 , and viscosity @xmath6 . as emphasised by jury _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , only one length , @xmath38 , and one time @xmath39 can be constructed from these parameters .",
    "data sets ( l , t ) from any model of spinodal decomposition can be expressed in units of reduced length : @xmath40 and time , @xmath41 if all other physics is excluded from late - stage growth , then the dynamical scaling hypothesis  @xcite states that : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the domain size expressed in reduced length units and @xmath44 is a non - universal constant which allows for a period of growth in which molecular diffusion leads to the formation of sharp interfaces .",
    "the function @xmath45 should then approach a universal form , identical for all @xmath46 incompressible binary fluid mixtures following a deep quench .",
    "the model h equations have been integrated numerically in three dimensions both with @xmath47 ( a quench to finite temperature ) , and with @xmath48 ( a quench to zero temperature ) by a number of integration schemes  @xcite .",
    "the free energy defined in eqn  ( [ eq : freeng ] ) is also the basis for the lattice - boltzmann method of kendon _ et al . _",
    "although the lattice - boltzmann method has a physical motivation which replaces velocity and density fields by single particle distribution functions , it is essentially equivalent to direct numerical integration of model h such as that performed in  @xcite ( i.e. it should be regarded as a finite - difference scheme for solving these equations in the absence of noise ) .",
    "the work of  @xcite is therefore a confirmation of the scaling laws derived above .",
    "the contribution of kendon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in whose work both growth regimes were clearly seen for the first time , shows that the simple arguments given above are incorrect in the crossover regime , and that the crossover in model h extends over @xmath49 in reduced time units .",
    "it should be noted that this crossover was previously believed from simple scaling arguments to occur at @xmath50 .",
    "recently there has been further theoretical work by grant and elder : those authors suggest  @xcite that growth in the inertial regime implies a reynolds number that increases without limit .",
    "this would eventually lead to turbulent remixing of the fluids ; the requirement that the reynolds number be self - limiting ( i.e. that the critical reynolds number is not reached and therefore that turbulent remixing does not occur ) in the asymptotic regime implies a growth exponent of @xmath51 .",
    "there is at present no numerical evidence for the @xmath52 , and recent theoretical challenges to this idea have been made .",
    "novik and coveney point out in  @xcite that the relative strength of the interface ( characterised by the weber number ) must also be taken into account .",
    "a small weber number could delay the onset of turbulent remixing indefinitely .",
    "the hydrodynamic lattice gas used in the present paper does not rest on the macroscopic free energy functional proposed in eqn  ( [ eq : freeng ] ) .",
    "the model , which is particulate in nature , is described in detail below , and has a theoretical justification from a ` bottom up ' perspective . in a bottom - up view",
    "the lattice - gas technique may be regarded as a simplification of the molecular dynamics of a binary fluid , abstracting the key microscopic properties in a fictitious microworld .",
    "recent work has derived a microscopic basis for the rothman - keller model of binary immiscible fluids  @xcite .",
    "however , no systematic method exists for coarse - graining a real molecular dynamics description of a system to the lattice - gas model used here ( although such a systematic method does now exist for the dpd algorithm  @xcite ) .",
    "in our model equations  ( [ eq : ns]-[eq : surf_tens ] ) are emergent macroscopic properties .",
    "the single phase fhp lattice gas is known to satisfy eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) , and far from interfaces this behaviour is reproduced in our model  @xcite . in section  [ sec : st ] we demonstrate that our model has realistic surface tension behaviour at interfaces .    the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the dynamics of domain growth of both binary immiscible and ternary amphiphilic phases in our model .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] contains a brief description of our model , while section  [ sec : measure ] contains a description of the quantitative measurements of surface tension and viscosity . in sections",
    "[ sec : bips ] ,  [ sec : ocps ]  and  [ sec : tcps ] we present our results for self - assembly in critical and off - critical binary immiscible and ternary amphiphilic fluids respectively .",
    "we close the paper with discussion and conclusions in section  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "our lattice - gas model is based on a microscopic , bottom - up approach , where dipolar amphipile particles are included alongside the immiscible oil and water species .",
    "lattice - gas particles can have velocities @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the number of velocities per site .",
    "we shall measure discrete time in units of one lattice timestep , so that a particle emerging from a collision at site @xmath56 and time @xmath57 with velocity @xmath53 will advect to site @xmath58 where it may undergo the next collision .",
    "we let @xmath59 denote the presence ( @xmath12 ) or absence ( @xmath60 ) of a particle of species @xmath61 ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 denoting red ( oil ) , blue ( water ) and green ( amphiphile ) species respectively ) with velocity @xmath53 , at lattice site @xmath65 and time step @xmath57 .",
    "the collection of all @xmath66 for @xmath67 will be called the _ population state _ of the site ; it is denoted by @xmath68 where we have introduced the notation @xmath69 for the ( finite ) set of all distinct population states .",
    "the amphiphile particles also have an orientation denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "this orientation vector , which has fixed magnitude @xmath19 , specifies the orientation of the amphiphile particle at site @xmath56 and time step @xmath57 with velocity @xmath53 .",
    "the collection of the @xmath55 vectors @xmath70 at a given site @xmath56 and time step @xmath57 is called the _",
    "orientation state_. we also introduce the _ colour charge _ associated with a given site , @xmath71 as well as the total colour charge at a site , @xmath72 the state of the model at site @xmath24 and time",
    "@xmath57 is completely specified by the population state and orientation state of all the sites .",
    "the time evolution of the system is an alternation between an advection or",
    "_ propagation _ step and a _ collision step_. in the first of these , the particles move in the direction of their velocity vectors to new lattice sites .",
    "this is described mathematically by the replacements @xmath73 @xmath74 for all @xmath65 , @xmath54 and @xmath75 .",
    "that is , particles with velocity @xmath53 simply move from point @xmath56 to point @xmath58 in one time step . in the collision step ,",
    "the newly arrived particles interact , resulting in new momenta and surfactant orientations .",
    "the collisional change in the state at a lattice site @xmath56 is required to conserve the mass of each species present @xmath76 as well as the @xmath77-dimensional momentum vector @xmath78 ( where we have assumed for simplicity that the particles all carry unit mass ) .",
    "thus , the set @xmath69 of population states at each site is partitioned into _ equivalence classes _ of population states having the same values of these conserved quantities .",
    "we assume that the characteristic time for collisional and orientational relaxation is sufficiently fast in comparison to that of the propagation that we can model this probability density as the gibbsian equilibrium corresponding to a local , sitewise hamiltonian function ; that is @xmath79 , \\label{eq : beta_defn}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is an inverse temperature , @xmath81 is the energy associated with collision outcome @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the equivalence - class partition function .",
    "the sitewise hamiltonian function for our model has been previously derived and described in detail for the two - dimensional version of the model  @xcite , and we use the same one here .",
    "it is @xmath84 where we have introduced the _ colour flux _ vector of an outgoing state , @xmath85 the _ total director _ of a site , @xmath86 the _ dipolar flux _ tensor of an outgoing state , @xmath87 the _ colour field _ vector , @xmath88 the _ dipolar field _ vector , @xmath89 the _ colour field gradient _ tensor , @xmath90 the _ dipolar field gradient _ tensor , @xmath91 defined in terms of the scalar director field , @xmath92 and the kinetic energy of the particles at a site , @xmath93 where @xmath5 is the average velocity of all particles at a site , the mass of the particles is taken as unity , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are coupling constants . to maintain consistency with previous work we use the coupling constants as previously defined in  @xcite .",
    "the values of these constants are :    @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102    these values were chosen in order to maximise the desired behaviour of sending surfactant to oil - water interfaces while retaining the necessary micellar binary water - surfactant phases .",
    "it should be noted that the inverse temperature - like parameter @xmath80 ( whose numerical value is varied in this paper ) is not related in the conventional way to the kinetic energy . for a discussion of the introduction of this parameter into lattice gases we refer the reader to the original work by chen , chen , doolen and lee  @xcite , and chan and liang  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : hamil])-([eq : calpdef ] ) were derived by assuming that there is an interaction potential between colour charges , and that the surfactant particles are like `` colour dipoles '' in this context  @xcite .",
    "the term parameterised by @xmath94 models the interaction of colour charges with surrounding colour charges as in the original rothman - keller model  @xcite ; that parameterised by @xmath95 describes the interaction of colour charges with surrounding colour dipoles ; that parameterised by @xmath96 accounts for the interaction of colour dipoles with surrounding colour charges ( alignment of surfactant molecules across oil - water interfaces ) ; and finally that parameterised by @xmath97 describes the interaction of colour dipoles with surrounding colour dipoles ( corresponding to interfacial bending energy or `` stiffness '' ) .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in two dimensions  @xcite , and the three - dimensional implementation employed in the present paper is described in more detail by boghosian , coveney and love  @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the results of simulations designed to measure the values of the macroscopic physical parameters which control domain growth in fluid systems in our model , according to the top - down theories described in section 1 .",
    "as emphasised above , these parameters are the surface tension @xmath19 , the viscosity @xmath6 and the density @xmath37 .",
    "we measured the viscosity by analysing the decay of shear waves .",
    "we performed simulations to observe the decay of shear waves with an initial velocity profile of the form : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the lattice size in the @xmath105 direction , @xmath106 is the amplitude of the shear wave at time @xmath57 , and @xmath107 is the unit vector in the @xmath108 direction . solving the navier - stokes equations for the time evolution of @xmath106 gives : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the initial amplitude of the shear wave and @xmath111 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "we therefore initialise the system with a velocity profile given by  ( [ eqn : profile ] ) and observe the decay of the shear wave by calculating : @xmath112 where @xmath113 indicates summation over all lattice sites in the @xmath114 plane .",
    "this gives the mean @xmath108 component of velocity , but includes any net @xmath108 velocity the system may possess .",

    "the central feature of ternary amphiphilic fluids is the lowering of the interfacial tension between oil and water by the adsorption of surfactant at the interface .",
    "the existence of a spinodal point in a binary immiscible fluid is an important feature of the fluid s thermal behaviour . at temperatures above the spinodal point",
    "the fluid will not demix into single phase domains .",
    "as one increases the temperature towards the spinodal point the surface tension should be reduced to zero .",
    "we used a direct dynamical method for calculating the surface tension across a flat interface . in the vicinity of an interface",
    "the pressure is locally anisotropic , as the pressure in the direction parallel to the interface is reduced by the tension on the interface itself . for a system with flat interface perpendicular to the @xmath108 axis",
    "the surface tension is given by the line integral over @xmath108 of the component @xmath119 of pressure normal to the interface minus the component @xmath120 tangential to the interface  @xcite : @xmath121 where : @xmath122 @xmath123    we begin by showing that our model is capable of reproducing physically realistic interfacial tensions in systems of binary immiscible fluids .",
    "we performed @xmath124 simulations for values of @xmath125 , using systems of size @xmath126 .",
    "the surface tension was measured every time step for @xmath127 time steps .",
    "the simulation with @xmath128 was above the spinodal point .",
    "the spinodal point itself was located by a computational steering technique , which was found to be computationally more efficient than traditional taskfarm methods .",
    "the value of @xmath80 was modified during a simulation and the phase separation behaviour visualised in real time .",
    "the value of @xmath80 at the spinodal point was found to be @xmath129 .",
    "this ` compusteering ' technique represents a powerful and economic simulation technique , and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "equilibration effects were found to be significant only close to the spinodal point , and equilibration times for @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 were taken as @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath134 time steps respectively .",
    "all other simulations were allowed to equilibrate for @xmath135 time steps and the surface tension was then time averaged for the remainder of the simulation .",
    "the surface tension as a function of @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "we next analyse the behaviour of the surface tension as a function of surfactant concentration adsorbed onto an oil - water interface .",
    "we use two types of system , both initialised with a flat oil - water interface perpendicular to the @xmath108 direction .",
    "the first system is initialised with a fixed amount of surfactant at the interface .",
    "the second is initialised with the surfactant dispersed throughout the system .",
    "we compute the surface tension as above from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : anisigma ] ) .",
    "the equilibrium state for such a system in our model is quite complex .",
    "the simplistic macroscopic picture of interfaces in ternary systems is fairly static , with a monolayer of surfactant coating the interface and lowering the surface tension .",
    "however , in reality as well as in our model the surfactant may also exist in bulk solution far from the interface , either as monomers or micelles or both .",
    "equilibration of the system is achieved when the rates for adsorption and desorption of monomers and micelles are equal .",
    "these times are typically long , varying from @xmath136 to @xmath137 time steps in our model .",
    "for the first type of system we simulate , where all surfactant particles initially reside at the interface , the surface tension prior to equilibration calculated by  ( [ eq : anisigma ] ) is an increasing function of time . the surfactant density at the interface decreases with time as monomers and micelles desorb into the bulk . for the second type of system , where all surfactant particles reside in the bulk , the surfactant density at the interface increases as the surfactant adsorbs to the interface .",
    "the surface tension calculated by  ( [ eq : anisigma ] ) is a decreasing function of time .",
    "we calculate the surface tension as a function of surfactant density in two ways . for low surfactant concentrations where we can reach timescales",
    "on which the system is equilibrated we use the surface tension and interfacial density for the equilibrated system . for higher surfactant densities where the equilibration times become prohibitive",

    "data from our simulations satisfying this constraint spans a range of @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",

    "_ was ascribed to ` excessive diffusion ' in the lattice gas algorithm .",
    "the particulate noise characteristic of the lattice gas is not present in their lattice - boltzmann algorithm , and so it is perfectly plausible that these fluctuations continue to inhibit phase separation , reducing the growth exponent in the viscous regime to some effective exponent close to the @xmath174 usually associated with the inertial regime .",
    "an identical effect is well known in two dimensions , where models with fluctuations yield an exponent of @xmath175 in the early time regime , and models without yield an exponent of @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "this issue deserves some closer examination , however .",
    "if we interpret our structure factor and correlation function data as exhibiting goood scaling collapse ( i.e. for all times considered the morphology is characterised by a single lengthscale ) , then the @xmath159 crossover at small q is consistent with speculations by furukawa that fluctuations would cause the @xmath176 behaviour .",
    "as noted above these fluctuations may act to inhibit the phase separation and give rise to a lower effective exponent .",
    "our immiscible lattice - gas model reduces to a simulation of a convection - diffusion equation for @xmath177 .",
    "the diffusion constant in this equation is a function only of the collision rules . it may be possible by a judicious choice of collision rules or addition of rest particles to vary this diffusion constant independent of surface tension to fully investigate its effect .",
    "if , however , we interpret the small @xmath150 behaviour as being indicative of poor scaling collapse , the exponent seen may be interpreted as a crossover between an early time and viscous regime .",
    "this issue could only be resolved by larger and longer simulations , and present hardware limitations mean that this must remain a matter for future investigation .",
    "there is at present considerable uncertainty about both the universality of the asymptotic scaling and what the true asymptotic regime is .",
    "theoretical work concerning the dispersion relation on fluid interfaces casts doubt on the universality of hydrodynamic phase separation in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recent work by kendon  @xcite proposes a new set of macroscopically deduced scaling laws , based on the energy balance in the system .",
    "this analysis suggests that there may be more than one length scale of importance in spinodal decomposition .",
    "another derivation of the growth laws proposes that the @xmath178 is transient and true asymptotic scaling is @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "however , it would be difficult to resolve such a subtle difference in exponent with any current numerical method .",
    "in addition , the derivation of  @xcite assumes a droplet morphology , even in the symmetric case .",
    "no such morphology is seen in any simulation of the symmetric case of which we are aware .",
    "the existence of multiple length scales and breakdown of scaling in two dimensional spinodal decomposition is well established  @xcite , and the existence of a single underlying scaling function in three dimensions remains an open question .",

    "the domain structure is not bicontinuous . the minority oil ( or water ) phase exists as droplets , and the domains coarsen by diffusion of oil ( or water ) from the bulk onto the droplet , and by droplet coalescence .",
    "the composition @xmath180 for a system where oil is the minority phase is defined as : @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the reduced densities of oil and water respectively .",
    "we performed simulations for values of @xmath184 , and @xmath185 .",
    "these simulations were performed on @xmath126 systems for @xmath186 time steps .",
    "the correlation function was averaged over five independent simulations for @xmath184 , and three independent simulations for @xmath185 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : seven ] and [ fig : eight ] .",
    "the data in our simulations gives effective exponents of @xmath187 and @xmath188 for compositions @xmath189 and @xmath190 respectively .",
    "we do not observe the exponent @xmath158 expected from simple theories of droplet coalescence and nucleation .",
    "however , as fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] shows , the morphology for both these volume fractions is far from being a collection of isolated drops .",
    "it is likely that the exponent we measure is therefore intermediate between the critical case and droplet coalescence and nucleation .",
    "the existence of such intermediate exponents is well established .",
    "previous work by appert _",
    "_  @xcite on off - critical decomposition for @xmath191 also saw growth more rapid than the @xmath192 expected for simple nucleation and coalescence .",
    "the work of  @xcite for the two - dimensional implementation of our model similarly saw a continuous variation of exponent with composition , as did  @xcite for equal viscosity dpd fluids .",
    "in this section we turn to the analysis of ternary amphiphilic fluids .",
    "we concentrate on systems with equal amounts of oil and water , varying the amount of surfactant for each simulation .",
    "the presence of surfactant dramatically alters the interfacial energetics and structure , and consequently the dynamics of domain growth . specifically , the adsorption of surfactant at oil - water interfaces and its concomitant lowering of the surface tension weaken the forces which drive binary immiscible phase separation . for sufficiently large surfactant concentrations",
    "the final equilibrium state is a bicontinuous or sponge _ microemulsion _ phase , where the domain growth is arrested at some final characteristic domain size @xmath193 .",
    "such a system is depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : nine ] ) .",
    "all three components are bicontinuously connected , with the surfactant particles lining the interface in a monolayer between the percolating oil and water regions .",
    "we work with @xmath194 and use the values for the coupling coefficients in eqn  ( [ eq : hamil ] ) as defined earlier ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the results that follow for the ternary emulsion system have been obtained from a @xmath126 system with periodic boundary conditions in all directions , the system having been intialised from a random quench with the particles placed randomly on the lattice .",
    "the total reduced density of the system was kept constant at @xmath195 .",
    "the characteristic domain size @xmath138 was measured from the spherically averaged pair correlation function as described in section  [ sec : corrfunct ] .",
    "the growth of sponge as opposed to droplet phases in these systems means that for the lowest values of the surfactant concentration the growth behaviour should represent a perturbation of the critical quenches investigated in section  [ sec : bips ] .",
    "the results for reduced surfactant concentrations @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 support this conclusion . in all cases the late - time behaviour is consistent with an algebraic growth law of the form @xmath0 .",
    "prior to this there is an an early - time regime in which the growth is consistent with a diffusive algebraic exponent of @xmath199 .",
    "visualisation of the surfactant densities during this period shows that surfactant adsorbs at the oil - water interfaces .",
    "once the system reaches the biconinuous oil and water state the inertial hydrodynamic regime begins .",
    "the length of the diffusive period increases with increasing surfactant concentration ( @xmath135 time steps for reduced surfactant concentration @xmath200 , @xmath201 time steps for @xmath202 , @xmath203 time steps for @xmath204 and @xmath205 time steps for @xmath206 ) . as one increases the surfactant concentration the fluctuations in the domain size at late times increases .",
    "this is consistent with the known dynamical nature of the adsorption and desorption of surfactant to and from interfaces in ternary systems as one approaches emulsification . with a reduced surfactant density of @xmath207",
    "the time evolution of the domain size ceases to follow the algebraic @xmath0 growth law .",
    "we see a slower - than - algebraic growth law , as previously observed in the two dimensional implementation of our model where a growth function @xmath208 was proposed , based on a comparison with slow growth in systems with quenched impurities  @xcite .",
    "consequently we look at a plot of @xmath209 against domain size in order to determine whether we have logarithmically slow growth in this regime .",
    "the characteristic domain size @xmath138 for surfactant concentrations @xmath210 are plotted against @xmath211 on logarithmic scales in fig .",
    "( [ fig : eleven ] ) .",
    "one can clearly see a transition through a regime where logarithmically slow growth dominates throughout the timescale of the simulation .",
    "such a growth law is inconsistent with arrest of the domain growth at late times for reduced surfactant density below @xmath212 .",
    "as we increase the reduced surfactant density beyond @xmath212 we see complete arrest of the domain growth at late times .",
    "we performed a fit of a stretched exponential function to datasets from simulations with @xmath213 .",
    "this function is defined identically with  @xcite : @xmath214    these fits are shown in fig .",

    "we have studied the dynamics of domain growth in binary immiscible fluids , in both critical and off - critical cases , and in ternary ( oil - water - surfactant ) emulsions and microemulsions , using a three - dimensional hydrodynamic lattice gas model . in the critical binary case we performed a scaling analysis similar to that of jury _ et al . _",

    "@xcite showed an inertial exponent in a crossover region of the reduced scaling plot . in the off - critical case we find effective exponents of @xmath218 and @xmath219 for compositions @xmath185 and @xmath189 respectively . in the microemulsion case",
