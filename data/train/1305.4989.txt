    "as we all know , the quantum field theory is perturbative theory . that is to say ,",
    "it can not be solved exactly . to obtain finite results , renormalization is necessary and there are some typical renormalization schemes such as ms , @xmath2 , mom , zero - momentum and on - shell schemes@xcite . in ms scheme ,",
    "the counter term is just the pole term(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the counter term is proportional to @xmath4 in @xmath2 scheme .",
    "the two foregoing schemes have nothing to do with mass . for the on - shell scheme ,",
    "the renormalization constants are all obtained under on - shell condition .",
    "it is the only physical scheme .",
    "for electroweak theory , the on - shell scheme is the most appropriate one .",
    "if we can resolve the theory accurately , different renormalization schemes can give the same finite result of any physical process though the functions of the renormalized parameters are different .",
    "however , different physical predictions are produced from different renormalization schemes and different renormalized parameters , because of the curtate perturbation theory .    to obtain the counter term for the uv - divergent diagram",
    ", one can take all the external momenta of the diagram as zero , which is called zero - momentum renormalization scheme .",
    "the advantage is that in arbitrary model each divergent diagram is easy to be renormalized , and the renormalized results are decoupled@xcite .",
    "we focus on the on - shell renormalization scheme that is popular in electroweak theory . in the on - shell scheme ,",
    "the fine structure constant @xmath5 is an expansion parameter and defined in the thomson limit . at any order of perturbation theory , the physical parameters are the same as the finite renormalized parameters .",
    "they represent clear physical meaning and can be measured directly in experiment .",
    "the renormalization procedure is summarized in the counter term approach@xcite .",
    "extending sm , physicists have developed many new models@xcite to explain the experimental phenomena .",
    "mssm@xcite is the most attractive one .",
    "a lot of experimentalists of high energy physics are focusing on searching for higgs bosons in mssm .",
    "the colliders ( lhc , @xmath6 linear collider , etc . ) will provide abundant information of new physics beyond sm . in mssm ,",
    "the decays @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are studied at one - loop order with the on - shell renormalization scheme@xcite , but they do not give analytic results to show the elimination of uv - divergence apparently . considering the one - loop contributions , the authors@xcite completed systematic on - shell renormalization programme for gauge boson and higgs parts .",
    "radiative one - loop corrections to the process @xmath10(hadrons ) are calculated with the same scheme@xcite .    for supersymmetric gauge theories ,",
    "a consistent regularization scheme preserving supersymmetry and gauge invariance is still not known .",
    "two equivalent ways to solve the problem are shown here .",
    "one is to use an invariant scheme to keep the symmetries to manifest , where only those counterterms are necessary for renormalization that they themselves preserve the symmetries .",
    "the other is to use a non - invariant scheme , through using appropriate non - invariant counterterms to compensate the corresponding symmetry breaking . with appropriate non - invariant counterterms",
    ", w.hollik@xcite shows supersymmetric qed can keep the supersymmetry .",
    "their study can be generalized to supersymmetric models with soft breakings and eventually to the supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . although the corresponding slavnov taylor identities are more involved since they have to express not only the symmetries but also the spontaneous or soft breaking , their structure is the same as in sqed .",
    "therefore , this method can also extend to full ew theory of the mssm .    with the extension of the on - shell scheme of sm , the vertexes @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath1 are studied at one - loop order in this work .",
    "we find some special characters for the on - shell scheme in mssm . compared with the zero - momentum scheme , it is easy to find the renormalized results in the on - shell scheme are decoupled .",
    "these selected vertexes are ordinary , and can represent the general vertexes in mssm .",
    "the study of the on - shell scheme for these vertexes is propitious to complete the on - shell renormalization programme of mssm .",
    "if one studies the on - shell renormalization scheme in other models , it is also helpful .    after the introduction , in sect.2 we study both the zero - momentum scheme and the on - shell scheme of two sm vertexes in mssm .",
    "the corresponding results of the susy vertex are shown in sect.3 . in sect.4 ,",
    "the decoupling behaviors for the counter terms in both renormalization schemes are researched .",

    "all the renormalization constants in the counter term must be taken into account .",
    "at the same time , in mssm we can not always renormalize one triangle diagram by the counter term made up of renormalization constants .",
    "after careful study , both characters of the on - shell scheme are discovered .",
    "one character is that all the triangle diagrams belonging to one type for a vertex are essential .",
    "only the sum of the amplitude can be renormalized completely .",
    "the other character is that not all the renormalization constants are always necessary .",
    "which renormalization constant must be considered lies on the idiographic condition .",
    "this work shows that for the sm vertex @xmath16 the lepton wave function renormalization constants @xmath83 are requisite to obtain the needed counter term .",
    "however , the condition of the vertex @xmath43 is dissimilar .",
    "to gain the final finite results , we have to calculate all the renormalization constants in the counter term formula . for the mssm vertex ,",
    "the foregoing experience is of value of reference .",
    "the on - shell scheme for the mssm vertex @xmath1 shows the property , i.e. just the wave function renormalization constant for the relevant slepton @xmath84 is enough for completing the on - shell scheme .    in the two renormalization schemes",
    ", we study the decoupling behavior for the counter terms of these vertexes . obviously",
    ", the counter terms obtained in the two renormalization schemes have the same characters for the infinite and large logarithm terms , when the susy particle masses are equal and very heavy . because the renormalized results in the zero - momentum scheme are decoupled",
    ", the on - shell renormalization scheme can also give decoupled renormalized results .",
    "there are a great deal of vertexes in mssm , so it is hard to make one - loop on - shell renormalization for all of them .",
    "the studied vertexes in this work are representative , which can be helpful to upbuild a consistent on - shell renormalization scheme in mssm .",
    "though there are a number of questions to deal with , one can be convinced that a perfect on - shell renormalization scheme can be found in the future .",
    "this text is also propitious to study the on - shell renormalization scheme in other models , even the model is more complex than mssm .",
