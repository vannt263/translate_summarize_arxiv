    "numerous calculations have established that relativistic mean - field models provide a realistic description of the bulk properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "in addition to this successful low - energy phenomenology , these models are often extrapolated into regimes of high density and temperature to extract the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , which is the basic ingredient in many astrophysical applications and in microscopic models of energetic nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "based on the original version of walecka @xcite and its extensions @xcite , relativistic mean - field models generally involve the interaction of dirac nucleons with neutral scalar and vector mesons and with isovector @xmath2 mesons .",
    "one of the key observations in their success is that to provide sufficient flexibility , nonlinear self - interactions for the scalar meson must be included .",
    "since these models were proposed to be renormalizable , the scalar self - interactions are limited to a quartic polynomial , and scalar  vector and vector  vector interactions are not allowed @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for renormalizability , as discussed in walecka s seminal paper , is that once the model parameters are calibrated to observed nuclear properties , one can extrapolate into regimes of high density or temperature without the appearance of new , unknown parameters .",
    "an alternative approach is inspired by _ effective _ field theories , such as chiral perturbation theory @xcite , which successfully describes the low - energy phenomenology of hadronic goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "although a lagrangian usually serves as the starting point , the meson and baryon fields are no longer considered elementary , and the constraint of renormalizability is dropped .",
    "this has several important consequences .",
    "first , there is no reason to restrict meson self - interactions to a simple quartic polynomial in the scalar field ; on the contrary , one should include all interaction terms that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "second , since there are an infinite number of coupling constants , one must find suitable expansion parameters for the systems under consideration , and one must develop a systematic truncation scheme for the effective theory to have any predictive power .",
    "third , extrapolation of calculated results into new regimes of the physical parameters becomes problematic , because the truncation scheme may break down , and predictions can become sensitive to unknown parameters .    within the framework of effective field theory ,",
    "mean - field models of nuclear structure and the eos must be interpreted in a new context .",
    "one important observation is that near normal nuclear density , the mean scalar and vector fields ( or nucleon self - energies ) , which we denote as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are large on nuclear energy scales but are small compared to the nucleon mass @xmath5 and vary slowly in finite nuclei .",
    "this implies that the ratios @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the gradients @xmath8 and @xmath9 are useful expansion parameters .",
    "the assumption of `` naturalness '' in effective field theory is also important .",
    "naturalness implies that the coefficients of the various terms in the lagrangian , when expressed in appropriate dimensionless form , should all be of order unity . when combined with meaningful expansion parameters",
    ", this means that one can anticipate the approximate magnitude of mean - field contributions to the energy ( at least up to moderate nuclear densities ) and thereby motivate a suitable truncation scheme ; if the coefficients are natural , the omitted terms will be numerically unimportant .",
    "naturalness also implies that one should include _ all _ possible terms ( that is , those allowed by the symmetries ) through a given order of truncation ; it is _ unnatural _ for some coefficients to vanish without a relevant symmetry argument .    from this point of view , it is difficult to justify nuclear mean - field models that include only scalar self - interactions @xcite , and recently , generalizations that also include quartic self - interactions for the neutral vector meson have been discussed @xcite .",
    "moreover , a new analysis involving all meson self - interactions through fourth order in the isoscalar scalar and vector fields has been performed @xcite .",
    "these extensions give rise to additional model parameters ( coupling constants ) that must be constrained by calibrating to observed nuclear properties . for the truncation at fourth order to be sensible , the parameters so obtained should exhibit naturalness .",
    "although it is possible to discuss effective hadronic field theory from the point of view of a lagrangian , as above , the expansion in powers of the mean fields is a low - density expansion , and it is hard to justify the neglect of many - body corrections , which are known to be relevant in nuclear structure and in the eos .",
    "alternatively , one can consider this expansion at the level of an energy functional or effective action @xcite .",
    "in such a formulation of the relativistic nuclear many - body problem , the central object is an energy functional of scalar and vector densities ( or more generally , vector four - currents ) @xcite .",
    "extremization of the functional gives rise to dirac equations for occupied orbitals with _",
    "local _ scalar and vector potentials , not only in the hartree approximation , but in the general case as well . rather than work solely with the densities",
    ", one can introduce auxiliary variables corresponding to the local potentials , so that the functional depends also on mean meson fields .",
    "the resulting field equations have the same form as in a dirac  hartree calculation @xcite , but correlation effects can be included , _ if _ the proper energy functional can be found .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the well - known kohn",
    " sham @xcite approach in density - functional theory , with the local meson fields playing the role of ( relativistic ) kohn  sham potentials ; by introducing nonlinear couplings between these fields , one can implicitly include additional density dependence in the potentials .",
    "thus the nonlinear meson interaction terms simulate more complicated physics , such as one- and two - pion exchange , or vacuum - loop corrections , which might be calculated directly in a more microscopic many - body approach @xcite .",
    "the fields ( and their gradients ) again serve as useful expansion parameters at moderate density , so the nonlinear interaction terms can be truncated , leaving a finite number of unknown couplings .    rather than",
    "focus on the calculation of the nonlinear couplings from an underlying effective lagrangian , we wish to concentrate instead on how well the energy functional can be calibrated by fitting the couplings to observed nuclear properties , and on the limitations on the extrapolation of the resulting eos into the high - density regime .",
    "in general , even with a significant truncation , the number of unknown couplings exceeds the number of normalization conditions , which we take to be five properties of infinite nuclear matter : the equilibrium density and binding energy ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , the nucleon effective ( or dirac ) mass at equilibrium ( @xmath12 ) , the compression modulus ( @xmath13 ) , and the bulk symmetry energy ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "( experience has shown that an accurate reproduction of these five properties leads to realistic results when the calculations are extended to finite nuclei @xcite . )",
    "thus families of models can be generated which describe exactly the same nuclear matter properties at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we then investigate the differences in the high - density eos predicted by models within a given family .",
    "this question is important for astrophysical applications , particularly in the study of neutron stars ; it will be difficult to deduce the existence of `` exotic '' neutron - star structure ( for example , hyperonic matter , kaon condensates , or quark cores ) unless the eos of the more mundane components ( neutrons , protons , and electrons ) is well constrained .    if our truncation of the energy functional is motivated by low - density behavior , why should we have any confidence at all in a high - density extrapolation ?",
    "this is indeed the crucial question , and we are not attempting here to justify such an extrapolation ; we are merely recognizing that this procedure is often used in neutron - star calculations , even recent ones , without any mention of the implicit assumptions about the absence of additional contributions at high density @xcite .",
    "we therefore feel it is timely to investigate quantitatively the uncertainties in the extrapolated equation of state .",
    "we begin the theoretical analysis with a model that contains meson  meson and meson self - interactions described by an _ arbitrary _",
    "finite polynomial in the fields .",
    "we find that both the asymptotic ( high - density ) limit of the eos and the approach to this limit ( _ i.e. _ , the `` stiffness '' ) are model dependent",
    ". in particular , one can construct models with the _ same _ equilibrium nuclear matter properties that yield high - density equations of state ranging all the way from the causal limit ( @xmath15 ) to one that resembles a free relativistic gas ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath17 is the pressure and @xmath18 is the energy density . )    as an explicit example , we consider a model that includes self - interactions for the isoscalar scalar and vector mesons and for the @xmath2 meson up to fourth order in the fields . to our knowledge , this is the first time nonlinear terms in the @xmath2",
    "meson mean field have been included .",
    "( note that the @xmath2 field enters here as an _ effective _ field whose purpose is to parametrize the isospin dependence ; thus , fundamental questions about causal propagation @xcite and spin mixing @xcite are not relevant . ) to provide a quantitative measure of the variations in the eos , we compute neutron star masses , which turn out to be sensitive to the model types and to changes in the parametrizations , _ even for models that reproduce the same equilibrium nuclear matter properties_. in some cases , variations in the calculated maximum mass are more than one solar mass .",
    "these results lead us to two basic conclusions .",
    "first , existing methods for calibration of the eos at normal density are _ not _ sufficient to provide a satisfactory extrapolation into the density regime relevant for neutron stars .",
    "the basic problem rests with the quartic neutral vector meson ( @xmath1 ) interaction , which produces major modifications in the high - density behavior .",
    "we discuss the existing situation regarding the specification of this term and prospects for improved calibration .",
    "second , we find that if the quartic @xmath1 term can be accurately determined , additional higher - order terms ( and the quartic @xmath2 term ) produce relatively minor changes in the neutron star mass .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath19 term softens the high - density eos so completely that additional interactions have little effect , at least in the density regime relevant for neutron stars .",
    "these conclusions have important implications , because the contributions to the eos from the neutrons and protons are commonly believed to be the best understood part of the physical input necessary to describe a dense stellar object . without well - constrained results from this part of the eos",
    ", it will be impossible to determine the importance of additional dynamics , for example , the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter in the interiors of neutron stars @xcite , or the role of strangeness in the form of hyperons @xcite or a kaon condensate @xcite . as an example of how uncertainties in the basic nuclear eos can influence these interesting effects",
    ", we study the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter using a simple model @xcite and show the possible variations in the results .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we present the general model , which involves an arbitrary number of nonlinear meson interactions , and derive the eos .",
    "based on this general model , section iii is devoted to the high - density limit of the eos . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply our model to neutron stars . for the quantitative analysis",
    ", we initially include self - interactions up to fourth order in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 fields and then investigate the consequences of sixth - order and eighth - order @xmath1 self - interactions .",
    "we also briefly discuss the parameter and model dependence of the transition to quark matter in the central region of the star .",
    "section v contains a short summary and our conclusions .",
    "we describe the nuclear equation of state using a relativistic approach involving valence dirac nucleons and effective mesonic degrees of freedom , which are taken to be neutral scalar and vector fields , plus the isovector @xmath2 meson field . rather than focus directly on a lagrangian , we consider instead as a starting point an _ effective action _",

    "nucleon interaction , or its general form might be obtained from an underlying theory . here",
    "we will be satisfied to parametrize the effective action , calibrate it as accurately as we can to observed nuclear properties , and then examine the predicted high - density equation of state .",
    "the effective action is related to the thermodynamic potential @xmath24 @xcite by @xmath25\\ ,                 \\label{eq : omega1 }                        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the fields are determined by the general thermodynamic principle that they should make @xmath24 stationary : @xmath26 a basic property of the functional is that it reflects the underlying symmetries @xcite .",
    "thus , if we assume that the system possesses two conserved charges , namely , baryon number @xmath27 and the third component of total isospin @xmath28 , this gives rise to two chemical potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 the inverse temperature , and @xmath34 . note that the fields can be held fixed in evaluating the partial derivatives in eqs .",

    "we then extrapolate the resulting equation of state into the neutron - rich , high - density regime to calculate the properties of neutron stars .",

    "our basic goal is to determine , in light of these two problems , whether the calibration at equilibrium nuclear matter density is sufficient to predict a maximum neutron star mass within a reasonably small range .",
    "this is relevant in view of recent calculations that hope to see evidence for `` new '' physics in neutron stars ( such as quark cores , strange matter , or kaon condensates ) based on the need for a softer high - density equation of state than that provided by neutrons , protons , and electrons alone .",
    "these calculations assume that the high - density behavior of these more mundane components is well known , and in particular , that the contributions of many - nucleon forces are negligible@xcite .",
    "these many - body , density - dependent forces are precisely the ones that are difficult to calibrate using observed nuclear properties ; the question is whether one can build nuclear equations of state with different types of many - body forces that all reproduce the observed properties near equilibrium , but which yield significantly different results at high density .    by beginning with a meson self - interaction potential containing arbitrary powers of scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath0 ) , vector - isoscalar ( @xmath1 ) , and vector - isovector ( @xmath2 ) fields , we show that the meson nonlinearities can have a profound effect on the high - density equation of state . in models where the vector mesons enter the potential at most quadratically ,",
    "the equation of state is stiff and asymptotically approaches @xmath192 .",
    "( the walecka model is a special case . ) in models where the vector fields enter with high powers , these fields become negligible at high density , and the asymptotic equation of state resembles that of a free , relativistic gas : @xmath16 .",
    "the intermediate case occurs when the vector fields enter quartically ; the asymptotic equation of state is still soft ( @xmath16 ) , but the approach to the asymptotic limit is determined by the coupling parameters .",
    "we illustrate these results using specific models containing quartic @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson couplings and also sixth- and eighth - order @xmath1 couplings .",
    "all models are calibrated to exactly the same nuclear properties at equilibrium , for all choices of parameters .",
    "we find that by far the most important coupling constant is that of the quartic @xmath1 term ; even when restricted by the requirements of naturalness , variations in this parameter can produce variations of nearly one solar mass in the predicted maximum neutron star mass .",
    "( this is true for both pure neutron matter and for beta - stable matter . )",
    "this uncertainty is clearly relevant on the scale on which one hopes to identify new , exotic effects .",
    "moreover , increasing the strength of the quartic coupling softens the equation of state , which is precisely the effect sought from the exotica . the impact of a quartic @xmath2 meson coupling is smaller , and",
    "its effects are only appreciable in stars made of pure neutron matter ; the maximum masses of stars computed with beta - stable matter show little change when this parameter is varied within the bounds imposed by naturalness .",
    "similarly , sixth - order @xmath1 interactions have only a modest effect on the predicted maximum mass , and by the time the eighth - order terms are included , the high - density equation of state is already so soft that these terms are negligible .",
    "we emphasize that the importance of these many - body effects is not limited to the domain of relativistic mean - field theories ; equations of state based on nonrelativistic potentials @xcite use interactions that are calibrated to few - body systems and that are insensitive to possible six- or eight - body forces that may be relevant at high density .",
    "this is especially important because a mean - field calculation with four - component spinors and just _ two - body _ lorentz scalar forces already implicitly contains an infinite string of many - body forces if it is recast in terms of two - component spinors .    to illustrate these difficulties more concretely",
    ", we also study the role of the hadron / quark phase transition in a simple two - phase model with a first - order transition .",
    "we find that with couplings well within the bounds of naturalness , it is possible to push the phase transition to arbitrarily high density , and even to make it disappear altogether . although the absence of a phase transition is probably unrealistic and could serve to exclude some values of the hadronic parameters , there are still too many uncertainties on both sides of the transition ( as well as in the nature of the transition itself ! ) to make any definitive statements .",
    "we therefore conclude that existing methods for calibrating the nuclear equation of state for extrapolation into the neutron - rich , high - density regime appropriate for neutron stars can not constrain the predicted maximum star mass well enough to make reliable statements about the existence of `` new '' physics beyond the dynamics of neutrons , protons , and electrons . we show that the uncertainties arising from an incomplete knowledge of the hadronic many - body forces are much larger than those arising from an imperfect knowledge of the properties of nuclear matter near equilibrium , such as the nuclear matter compression modulus .",
    "even the old question of the role of the hadron / quark phase transition is problematic , since the high - density hadronic equation of state can be made essentially as soft as desired by the addition of nonlinear interactions that are still consistent with equilibrium nuclear matter properties .",
    "one positive conclusion is that the most important nonlinear parameter is that of the quartic @xmath1 interaction",
    ". if this term could be accurately calibrated , the uncertainties introduced by other nonlinear interactions are likely to be tolerable .",
    "( one caveat : we do not study carefully the sensitivity to variations in mixed scalar  vector interactions because of the overwhelming sensitivity to the quartic @xmath1 term ; if the latter were well constrained , the role of scalar  vector interactions should be examined in more detail . )",
    "although this coupling has not been extensively studied in mean - field calculations , there are several possibilities for determining it reasonably well .",
    "first , since a quartic @xmath1 interaction leads to a nonlinear density dependence in the vector part of the baryon self - energy , one could calibrate this interaction by fitting to the self - energy obtained in a dirac  brueckner  hartree  fock calculation , for example .",
    "although some initial attempts at this procedure have been made @xcite , the resulting parameters are not always natural ; it is probably necessary to repeat the procedure using all possible scalar and vector self - interactions through fourth order and to fit both the scalar and vector part of the self - energy simultaneously .",
    "second , the nonlinearities in the energy functional can be interpreted in terms of effective masses for the vector and scalar mesons ( defined by diagonalizing the matrix of appropriate second derivatives of the energy functional ) .",
    "this may provide useful constraints in the future , if concrete empirical information on these effective masses becomes available .",
    "third , it is possible that additional observables in finite nuclei could constrain the nonlinear interactions .",
    "for example , some recent work suggests that the ratio of the nuclear matter `` skewness '' ( which is related to the third derivative of the energy with respect to density at equilibrium ) to the compression modulus @xmath193 is constrained by monopole vibrations .",
    "although a recent calculation of nuclear ground - state properties shows little correlation with this ratio @xcite , a more detailed examination of dynamical effects could provide meaningful constraints .    to summarize",
    ", precise predictions of the properties of neutron stars apparently require more accurate calibrations of the nuclear equation of state than are currently available .",
    "it is especially important to have the high - density behavior of the `` standard '' components ( neutrons , protons , and electrons ) under control before one can make reliable statements about the existence of `` new '' physics .",
    "since the window on experimentally observable nuclear properties is a narrow one , producing an equation of state that can be extrapolated with confidence remains a major challenge .",
