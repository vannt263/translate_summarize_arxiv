    "their results however , do not consider the variation of probe power , since they are restricted to the single atom , single photon regime .    there has , to date , been no investigation that thoroughly explores the detection ` parameter space ' . here",
    "we analyse the snr of cavity single atom detection over this space : we provide contour plots for the snr as a function of cavity finesse , probe laser intensity , cavity - probe detuning , and atom - probe detuning .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide detailed information to groups who wish to design and implement cavity based single atom detection that is appropriate for their requirements of quantum efficiency and detection bandwidth @xcite .",
    "cavity quantum - electrodynamics ( qed ) is generally separated into two parameter regimes , those of strong and weak coupling .",
    "these define the relative strengths of coupling within the system and to external reservoir modes .",
    "strong coupling refers to system dynamics that are largely determined by the atom - field dipole coupling , @xmath0 , and it is this regime that has attracted much of the recent interest in cavity qed .",
    "consequently , recent investigations and experimental designs have , for the most part , been restricted to regimes that achieve the required strong coupling conditions .",
    "the focus of the present work is not to investigate properties of the strong coupling , but to analyse the cavity detection process in order to determine the best designs and operating conditions for single atom detection .",
    "we show , however , that many of the same features of strong - coupling experiments are necessary for good snrs in single atom detection .",
    "it is therefore worth clearly defining this regime .    for strong coupling ,",
    "the exchange of energy within the system occurs on a time scale much shorter than other processes , so that @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the set of decoherence rates for the system , and @xmath3 is the interaction time . in the atom - cavity system , @xmath4 with @xmath5 the rate of decay of the population of the atomic excited state  @xcite , and @xmath6 that of the cavity field . to achieve strong coupling ,",
    "it is necessary to ensure the atom - field interaction time , @xmath3 , is long with respect to other system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the atom - field coupling and the cavity decay rates are also important , and the coupling regime is often characterised in more specific terms with two dimensionless parameters ; the critical photon number@xmath7and the critical atom number@xmath8 these values indicate the number of quanta necessary to significantly influence the system .",
    "strong coupling is usually defined when both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are less than one .",
    "the critical photon number is the number of intra - cavity photons necessary to saturate the atom in a resonant transition . for our purposes , it is not an important value since we are unconcerned with the number of photons needed for a successful detection process .",
    "the critical atom number refers to the necessary number of atoms required to significantly affect the cavity field .",
    "for single atom detection , it is desirable to work with @xmath11 , since this implies the presence of a single atom will have a significant influence on the cavity transmission and be easily measured . @xmath9 is often inverted , and referred to as the co - operativity parameter , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "single - atom detection need not be performed in the strong coupling regime - where both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small - as has been highlighted in work by several authors @xcite .",
    "the main objective is to minimise @xmath9 subject to real world experimental constraints .",
    "short cavities may be used to increase @xmath13 , which scales as the inverse of cavity volume . as a result , short cavities lead to a reduction of @xmath10 .",
    "cavity length does not , however , influence @xmath9 , since @xmath6 scales as the inverse of cavity length . motivated by the strong coupling regime , and at times by the complementary requirements of restricted geometry in chip experiments , recent work in cavity qed has tended towards very short cavities , tens to hundreds of micrometers @xcite .",
    "although limiting cavity length will not improve single atom detection , it is possible to reduce the mode volume in ways that do help .",
    "reducing the beam diameter in the cavity is one such possibility @xcite .    as well as reducing cavity length , considerable efforts have been made to produce cavities with ultra - high finesse .",
    "this results in reduced cavity linewidth , @xmath6 , without an accompanying reduction in @xmath0 , so is an ideal way to manipulate @xmath9 .",
    "whispering gallery mode cavities have reached a finesse of @xmath14 @xcite and open optical cavities with finesses in excess of @xmath15 have been demonstrated using custom built mirrors @xcite .",
    "custom design and fabrication can be a costly and arduous task , however reasonably high finesses of around @xmath16 are within reach even with commercial mirrors @xcite .",
    "although this is a trade - off in mirror quality for ease and expense of construction , we will show that it is still possible to achieve a good snr for single atom detection using such a finesse , provided the system is operated in appropriate regions of parameter space . determining where these regions are",

    "the system we are interested in is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cavity](a ) .",
    "it consists of a single two - level atom with an excited state resonance at @xmath17 coupled to the tem@xmath18 mode of an optical cavity with frequency @xmath19 .",

    "dissipation occurs via spontaneous decay of the atomic excited state , @xmath5 , and cavity field decay , @xmath6 .",
    "the cavity decay comprises transmission through input and output mirrors as well as scattering losses : @xmath21 giving a cavity linewidth ( fwhm ) of @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is that of the driven jaynes - cummings model @xcite . in a reference frame rotating with the driving field ,",
    "@xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the creation and annihilation operators for the cavity mode , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the atomic pseudospin ( raising and lowering ) operators for the two - level atom .    the position - dependent atom - field coupling constant is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalised magnitude of the electric field . for a gaussian standing - wave of waist size @xmath30 and cavity length @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the effective mode volume , integrated over the cavity length , is @xmath33 .",
    "the single - photon electric field coupling constant for this mode is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the dipole moment of the atom aligned in the field .",
    "provided the cavity does not significantly alter the free space atomic decay rate , @xmath5 ( the purcell effect ) , the coupling can also be expressed as @xmath36 for atomic cross section @xmath37 .",

    "we will , however , concentrate on regimes , particularly with respect to intra - cavity photon number , where these effects are minimal .",
    "by ` parameter space ' for single atom detection , we refer to variations in cavity - probe , @xmath55 , and atom - probe , @xmath56 , detunings , cavity finesse , and probe power . in this section we present numerical data for the snr of atom detection with a maximally coupled atom - cavity system ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we find these data are naturally separated into two broad detection regimes : resonant detection at low probe powers , and non - resonant detection at higher powers .",
    "these regions of parameter space are addressed separately in [ resonant detection ] and [ non - resonant detection ] .",
    "initially we consider the resonant condition , a point in parameter space where all three system frequencies are coincident ; @xmath58 .",

    "the cavity length is @xmath66 m , and mode waist @xmath67 m . for a cavity with approximately planar",
    "mirrors the described geometry does not cover a significant solid angle around the atom . consequently , spontaneous emission is to external modes , rather than the single cavity mode , and the purcell effect can be ignored .",
    "the system has an atom - field coupling of @xmath68mhz and a cavity decay rate that scales inversely with finesse .",
    "we have chosen to present data for these parameters because they are in the range of realistic experimental design @xcite , however , the qualitative results that are presented in this work are common to a wide range of design choices .",
    "the data presented here are for an impedance - matched cavity , where @xmath69 , and the empty - cavity transmission is 100% . in an experimental set - up , it is the input probe power , rather than transmitted power , that is kept constant during an atom detection event , so data are parameterised in terms of this input photon flux . in the results presented , we consider @xmath70 , a reasonable approximation for cavities of moderate finesse .",
    "we also note that one can immediately gain a factor of @xmath71 in the snr , eq .",

    "an equivalent statement is to say that in this regime the effect of a single atom is only perturbative . in this limit",
    ", the atom can be modelled classically as a saturable absorber with absorption cross - section , @xmath84 , that scales , on resonance , as @xmath85@xmath86 is the intensity of light incident on the atom and @xmath87 is the atomic saturation intensity .",
    "we can describe the detection process as follows .",
    "in free space the detected signal , @xmath88 , is a measure of the atom s effect on a photon beam , and is proportional to the photon flux , @xmath89 , and the ratio of the atomic cross - section to the beam area , @xmath90 : @xmath91    with the atom and probe beam inside a cavity , several changes are observed .",
    "each photon now passes the atom more than once , effectively increasing @xmath89 .",
    "the atom therefore has a greater chance of absorbing each photon , and has a more significant effect on the probe beam when the absorption happens inside a cavity .",
    "as the finesse increases , so too does the number of round trips for each photon before it decays from the cavity mode , so the signal improves with finesse .",
    "a second effect of the intensity amplification by the cavity , is a reduction in atomic cross - section .",
    "increases in finesse therefore mean that the external probe power necessary to saturate the atom ( inside the cavity ) is reduced , and the maximum snr requires lower power as the finesse increases , in accordance with the dashed line in region ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ fluxvsfinesse](a ) .",
    "in contrast with the low - finesse regime , the high - finesse regime requires increasing probe powers with increasing finesse in order to achieve the maximum snr .    in region ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ fluxvsfinesse](a ) the critical atom number , @xmath9 , is less than one , so a single atom significantly influences the system .",
    "the smaller @xmath9 becomes , the more significant an effect a single atom will have . in this regime",
    ", we consider the quantum mechanical model in more detail .",
    "that model considers the coupling of two resonators , the bare two - level atom and the empty cavity , giving coupled ( dressed ) states , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , that are linear combinations of the uncoupled states : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the jaynes - cummings energy spectrum of these modes has eigenenergies given by    @xmath96    that reduce , in the case of resonant atom and cavity driving , @xmath97 , to @xmath98    a good review of the dressed states for this resonant condition is given in ref .",

    "energy spectrum for resonant dressed states .",
    "detunings reduce for high levels of excitation . ]",
    "figure  [ eigen ] shows the mode - splitting of the dressed atom - cavity system .",
    "when the driving laser is resonant with the uncoupled system , it is detuned from the dressed state resonances in an intensity - dependent manner .",
    "the detuning , @xmath99 , is found by considering the addition of a photon from the probe beam ( @xmath100 ) to the excited modes in the coupled system : @xmath101\\nonumber\\\\ = & & \\pm\\hbar g(\\sqrt{n+1}-\\sqrt{n})\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the detuning is largest at low power .",
    "as @xmath102 increases , the difference between @xmath103 and @xmath104 is reduced ( @xmath105 as @xmath106 ) , so at sufficiently high excitation @xmath99 vanishes and the resonant condition of the uncoupled system is recovered .",
    "consequently , in the high - power limit , there is no discernible difference between the transmission of an empty cavity and the cavity during an atom transit , and the signal is lost .",
    "it might therefore be expected that the best snr is obtained at low excitation , however the relative shot noise improves with increasing photon flux , so in fact the optimum snr occurs at an intermediate power that is a compromise of these limits .",
    "@xmath99 must be considered in the context of the system decay rates that determine the linewidth of the dressed modes .",

    "[ mode splitting](a ) ) , the dressed state resonant frequencies are not distinctly different from the empty cavity resonance . since there is little contrast , the signal is lost easily with increases in intra - cavity photon number ( fig .  [ mode splitting](b ) ) .",
    "as the finesse increases , the dressed state energies become more distinct from the uncoupled resonance ( fig .",
    "[ mode splitting](e ) ) .",
    "in the high - finesse regime , the probe power must be increased considerably before the high - intensity detuning limit ( @xmath105 ) comes into effect .",
    "consequently , increasing finesse requires increasing probe powers to achieve the maximum snr , as indicated in region ( ii ) of figs .",
    "[ fluxvsfinesse](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "if we choose to limit the probe power with which the cavity is driven ( the flux limit of single photon counting modules is discussed in sec .",
    "[ spcm ] ) , then the snr no longer improves with finesse , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fluxvsfinesse](d ) . in this high - finesse regime ,",
    "the mode - splitting results in a complete black - out of cavity transmission during an atom transit ( shown as the long arrow ( i ) in fig .",
    "[ mode splitting](e ) ) .",
    "further increases in finesse narrow the resonances but can not improve the signal that is already maximised . in this regime ,",
    "the snr only improves by increasing the probe power .",
    "although the regimes of high and low critical atom number ( regions ( i ) and ( ii ) respectively ) are best understood in quite different ways , they do have one important feature in common : the best snr occurs around the point of atomic saturation .",
    "in the case of high critical atom number , keeping the circulating power inside the cavity near the saturation intensity means reducing the input power as the finesse increases , as described in section [ absorber ] . in the low critical atom number regime ,",
    "the atom detunes the cavity from the driving field .",
    "consequently much of the probe light incident on the cavity is reflected and the atom does not experience an enhancement in circulating power due to the cavity . in order to saturate the atom in this regime , ever increasing amounts of power",
    "are required as the cavity finesse is increased .      by detuning the probe",
    ", we open the possibility of both ` positive ' and ` negative ' signals .",
    "the sign is arbitrarily defined by eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) , and is not important ; both positive and negative signals have been observed in previous cavity detection work @xcite .",
    "the arrows on fig .",
    "[ mode splitting](e ) show examples of the sign and magnitude of the signal for various detunings .",
    "arrows pointing down are an indication of positive signals , since they correspond to decreases in cavity transmission , while an upwards pointing arrow implies an increase in transmission during an atom detection event . for a resonant probe ( i ) ,",
    "the signal is always seen as a reduction ( ` dip ' ) in transmitted power , since the atom effectively detunes the system from resonance .",
    "a dip may also be observed if the probe is detuned from the empty cavity ( ii ) .",
    "alternatively , if the probe is detuned to a position corresponding to a resonance of the dressed system , the atom will bring the system onto resonance with the detuned probe , resulting in an increase ( ` peak ' ) in the power transmitted ( iii ) .    combining",
    "the choice of probe power with the possibility of detunings dramatically increases the parameter space for atom detection .",

    "the maximum snr is similar in both detection schemes , although the probe power that is necessary to achieve it varies somewhat .",
    "figure  [ comparison](b ) includes the quantum efficiencies of real detectors ; apd efficiency is @xmath124% and the photodiodes used in the heterodyne set - up are assumed to be @xmath168% efficient .",
    "the shaded region indicates the probe powers that are inaccessible to real apds due to their flux - limit .",
    "these realities show a significant difference between the two detection schemes .",
    "on - resonance , the best snr for the flux - limited apd is @xmath169 , whereas using heterodyne detection at a higher power can achieve a snr of @xmath170 .    for non - resonant detection the maximum snr of apd and heterodyne detection are in principle very similar .",
    "however , since the maximum occurs at high power , apds are less appropriate for detection in that regime .",
    "the snrs presented in our data are determined using photon statistics that are always shot - noise limited . the ability to achieve this depends on the stability of the system as well as the choice of operating regime .",
    "the operating condition least sensitive to frequency noise is the resonant position ( @xmath171 ) at the peak of the cavity transmission line since here small changes in detuning have little effect on the transmitted power .",
    "detuned detection at the side of the transmission line , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ detuning](d ) , is more sensitive to frequency noise since here the gradient on the amplitude is large so even small fluctuations in cavity detuning can significantly influence the power transmitted .    in the previous sections ,",
    "two broad detection regimes have been presented .",
    "section  [ resonant detection ] covered the snr behaviour for resonant detection where the observed signal is seen as a significant drop in amplitude at the transmission peak due to jaynes - cummings mode splitting . in sec .",
    "[ non - resonant detection ] the signal is observed from a point on the side of the transmission line where the signal is due to a small frequency shift of the line that causes a change in transmitted light at the detection frequency .",
    "frequency noise enters the system via variations in the probe laser frequency as well as the cavity length , so , to eliminate noise , these components must be extremely stable .",
    "the cavity design emphasised in this work has a length of @xmath75 m and finesse @xmath73 , giving a linewidth of almost @xmath110ghz . assuming frequency locking on the order of @xmath110mhz , amplitude fluctuations at the position of the signal marked by the short arrow in fig .",
    "[ detuning](d ) are roughly one part in @xmath172 .",
    "the transmitted power at this position is @xmath173 photons/@xmath35s , with shot noise of about one part in 100 , so the amplitude fluctuations due to frequency - locking limitations are well below the shot noise limit . for longer cavities or for cavities with higher finesse , however , the transmission linewidth decreases , so the relative frequency stability drops significantly .",
    "for some operating conditions and cavity designs the influence of frequency noise may therefore become difficult to eliminate .",
    "in such cases , if the noise can be measured , it can be simply subtracted from the signal .",
    "measuring the noise via an error signal is an ideal solution , since a possible mechanism for locking the laser , atom and cavity set - up involves the use of a far - detuned stabilisation laser and ` transfer cavity ' in addition to the probe beam .",
    "this technique is described in ref .",
    "the second laser could provide the necessary error signal to be subtracted from the measurement .",
    "having identified regions of parameter space that maximise the snr , a further question for signal analysis regards the separation of a detection event from the shot - noise of the empty cavity transmission , indicated with the dotted ` discriminator ' line in fig.[cavity](b ) .",
    "variations in the number of photons counted in a measurement interval of @xmath76s , for an empty cavity , are photon shot - noise fluctuations .",
    "so far , we have considered the same to be true of the number of counts from the cavity during an atom transit , and the two poissonian distributions are related by the snr .",
    "the qe and false count rate of the atom detection depend on the value chosen to distinguish between these photon distributions . for a resonant signal , where the detected photon number during an atom transit is less than that of an empty cavity , raising",
    "the discriminator increases the qe since it includes more of the distribution of ` signal ' counts , but more of the empty - cavity counts are also included , so the false counts increase .",
    "variation in qe and false detection count rate with discriminator position .",
    "solid traces are the normalised photon counts for the empty cavity ( fine ) and the cavity containing an atom ( thick )",
    ". dashed traces correspond to the qe ( thick ) and false counts ( fine ) as the position of the discriminator is varied .",
    "the snr is ( a)@xmath174 , ( b)@xmath175 . ]",
    "the qe ( false count rate ) is the integration of the poissonian photon distribution about @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) from zero up to the value at the discriminator position .",
    "figure  [ qe ] shows how the qe and false counts vary as the discriminating value is changed , for high and low snr ( figs .",
    "[ qe](a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .    when the empty - cavity and signal count rates are well separated , as in fig .",
    "[ qe](a ) , it is clear the discriminator must lie in the range between the two photon distributions .",
    "provided this range is large enough , a position can be assigned ( for example ) at least three standard deviations from each distribution ( 3@xmath178 below @xmath177 and 3@xmath179 above @xmath176 ) , giving a qe greater than @xmath180% , and probability of false counts less than @xmath110% .",
    "as the number of standard deviations is increased , the detection quality improves .",
    "the necessary snr depends on the desired detection quality ; for a discrimination position @xmath181 standard deviations ( @xmath182 ) from the centre of each photon count distribution , the minimum snr required is @xmath183 .    in fig .",
    "[ qe](b ) , for low snr , the photon count distributions are not well separated and it is difficult to find a position for the discriminator that is a good compromise between qe and false counts .",
    "such statistics do not represent ideal detection conditions .",
    "however , the false counts must be considered in context of the atom flux . for a large ( true ) atom count rate ,",
    "a high false count rate becomes more acceptable .",
    "in such a case , the discriminator may be positioned to include a significant fraction of the empty - cavity count distribution about @xmath177 .",
    "it is important to note the limitations of our model with respect to detection efficiency .",
    "we have considered maximal coupling between the atom and cavity field ( @xmath57 ) , neglecting any variation in coupling strength ( and corresponding signal strength ) that occurs when the atom transits the cavity away from the intensity maximum of the light field . in a real system , this variation critically effects the qe . if the low field intensity around the nodes of a standing - wave cavity can be avoided , the coupling strength seen by each atom can be made substantially more uniform .",
    "this can be achieved in two ways :    _ ( i ) _ for a non - resonant red - detuned probe , the electric dipole force can be used to pull the atoms through the intensity maxima of the cavity mode .",
    "the dipole potential is proportional to the field gradient , so the rapid intensity changes of a standing - wave can create a strong force along the cavity axis . on the basis of our modelling , we expect the regime around point b in fig",
    ".  [ detuning ] would provide both a strong axial dipole potential and a reasonable snr that is reduced by a factor of about 1.4 compared to best case resonant detection .",
    "there is also a weaker dipole force in the radial direction due to the gaussian beam profile . in principle",
    ", this could increase the effective width of the atom detector .",
    "assuming reasonable atom speeds of about 1  @xmath184 , however , the radial dipole force is not strong enough to substantially influence the atom trajectories .",
    "this is true both for the regimes considered here and in other work @xcite .    _",
    "( ii ) _ only linear cavities have axial mode structure .",
    "a travelling - wave ring cavity has a field that is uniform along the cavity axis .",
    "consequently all atoms transiting the field on - axis generate signals of the same strength . in this configuration , there is little to be gained from using red - detuned light since the dipole force acting on the atoms will only be in the radial direction , and , as discussed above , unable to significantly influence atom trajectories .",
    "a travelling - wave cavity therefore seems highly suited to resonant detection where the snr is maximised .",
    "the downside is that the lack of standing - wave structure yields a mode volume twice that of a linear cavity with the same round - trip length .",
    "this reduces @xmath185 by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "our modelling indicates that for both resonant and detuned detection with optimum probe power , travelling - wave cavities loose a factor of 1.3 to 1.5 in snr compared to standing - wave cavities with otherwise identical properties .",
    "it is also problematic that real multi - level atoms need circularly polarised light to drive a closed two - level transition . due to the birefringence of the dielectric mirrors used in high finesse cavities , planar ring cavities have vertical and horizontal polarisation modes that are non - degenerate . to force a resonant circular polarisation mode",
    "would mean some polarisation compensation inserted into the cavity , or a complex 3-d geometry that is symmetric with respect to the linear polarisation modes .    in summary ,",
    "non - resonant detection allows one to use a linear cavity with a standing wave and higher @xmath185 , but one is forced to consider red - detuned detection , which has lower potential snr than the resonant system .",
    "alternatively , a ring cavity with no standing wave , is better suited to resonant detection , but comes at a cost of potential snr due to the reduction in @xmath185 , and is in practice difficult to set up .",
    "the end result is that both options give similar performance .",
    "although there are many experimental details that we have not considered in the present work , our model is still useful for comparing real set - ups .",
    "for example , ttl _ et al .",
    "_ detected single atoms in a @xmath59rb atom - laser beam using a high finesse ( @xmath186 ) optical standing - wave cavity , with @xmath187 m , @xmath188 m @xcite .",
    "their detection made use of the dipole force to channel the atoms through antinodes of the cavity field , and optimum detection efficiency occurred for detunings of @xmath189 and @xmath190 with a driving photon flux of @xmath191 photons/@xmath35s . in our simulations , these cavity parameters and operating conditions suggest an ideal snr for single atom detection of about 10 .",
    "their cavity is appropriate for many experiments besides single atom counting since it accomplishes strong coupling conditions @xcite .",
    "the cavity design that we have discussed in this paper has a finesse that is an order of magnitude lower ( @xmath73 ) than the cavity presented in the work by ttl _",
    "et al_. nonetheless , we have demonstrated that for our moderate finesse , there exist operating regimes , in both resonant and detuned conditions , where the achievable snr is as good as that of the higher finesse cavity .",
    "the critical difference between the optimum operating regimes used in ref .",
    "@xcite and those shown in this work , is the use of high probe powers necessitating detection with a heterodyne set - up .",
    "in this work , we have presented a thorough analysis of single atom detection using optical cavities .",
    "the parameter space considered includes cavity - probe and atom - probe detunings as well as variable probe power , and we have shown that the snr for single atom detection is critically dependent on the choice of operating regime within this space .",
    "our modelled data suggest the parameter space be divided into two regimes : resonant and non - resonant detection .",
    "resonant detection with moderate to high - finesse cavities ( systems with low critical atom number ) is best described with the jaynes - cummings mode - splitting .",
    "non - resonant detection results in a frequency - pulling of the cavity transmission line .",
    "the best snr occurs on - resonance .",
    "however , very reasonable snrs are also available with non - resonant conditions , provided the atom and cavity detunings are chosen wisely and combined with appropriately high probe powers . with a standing - wave configuration ,",
    "red - detuned detection brings the benefit of the dipole potential that improves the effective atom - cavity coupling , however , equivalent snrs are achieved with resonant detection in a travelling - wave ring cavity .",
    "we have shown maximizing the snr for both resonant and non - resonant conditions requires photon fluxes that are in excess of apd saturation limits , so heterodyne detection is always a more desirable detection technique .",
    "working in high power regimes means that for a cavity of moderate finesse , @xmath73 , we can achieve a snr comparable or better than those achieved in previous experiments using cavities with significantly higher finesse .",
