    "the local enhancement in the monomer density on the right of the pore _ takes a finite time to dissipate away from the membrane along the backbone of the polymer _ ( similarly for replenishing monomer density on the left neighbourhood of the pore ) .",
    "the imbalance in the monomer densities between the two local neighbourhoods of the pore during this time implies that there is an enhanced chance of the translocated monomer to return to the left of the membrane , thereby giving rise to _ memory effects _ , and consequently , rendering the translocation dynamics subdiffusive .",
    "more quantitatively , the excess monomer density ( or the lack of it ) in the vicinity of the pore manifests itself in reduced ( or increased ) chain tension around the pore , creating an imbalance of chain tension across the pore ( we note here that the chain tension at the pore acts as monomeric chemical potential , and from now on we use both terms interchangeably ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] .      from our experience with the model we already know that the dynamical properties are rather insensitive to the ratio of the rates for rouse vs. reptation moves ( i.e. , moves that alter the polymer contour vs. moves that only redistribute the stored length along the backbone ) .",
    "since the computational efficiency of the latter kind of moves is at least an order of magnitude higher , we exploit this relative insensitivity by attempting reptation moves @xmath23 times more often than rouse moves ; typical values are @xmath24 , @xmath25 or 10 , which correspond to a comparable amount of computational effort invested in both kinds of moves .",
    "certainly , the interplay between the two kinds of moves is rather intricate @xcite .",
    "recent work by drzewinski and van leeuwen on a related lattice polymer model @xcite provides evidence that the dynamics is governed by @xmath26 , supporting our experience that , provided the polymers are sizable , one can boost one mechanism over the other quite a bit ( even up to @xmath27 ) before the polymer dynamics changes qualitatively .        in order to further check the trustworthiness of this model , we use it to study the equilibration properties of polymers with one end tethered to a fixed infinite wall ( this problem relates rather directly to that of a translocating polymer",

    "the notational distinction between primed and unprimed states is that a primed state can occur only between two consecutive states 0 , or between two consecutive states n , while an unprimed state occurs only between state 0 and state n. a probability argument then leads us to @xmath155 where @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the probabilities of the corresponding states , @xmath159 and @xmath160 . since the partition sum of a polymer of length @xmath104 with one end tethered on a membrane is given by @xmath161 with @xmath162 a non - universal constant and @xmath163 @xcite , we have @xmath164\\sim1/n$ ] .",

    "to conclude , we have shown that for the swollen rouse chain , translocation is sub - diffusive up the configurational relaxation time ( rouse time ) of the molecule , after which it has a further fickian regime before the longer dwell time is exhausted : the mean square displacement along the chain is described by @xmath169 up to @xmath170 , after which @xmath171 .",

    "may be an appropriate model for the dynamics of long biopolymers in the environment within living cells , if it is sufficiently gel - like to support screened hydrodynamics on the timescale of their configurational relaxation .",
    "however , we should also ask what is expected in the other extreme of unscreened ( zimm ) hydrodynamics . for our theoretical discussion",
    "the key difference is that , instead of the rouse time @xmath16 , in the zimm case the configurational relaxation times scale with @xmath0 according to @xmath173 in 3d , which upon substitution into our earlier argument would gives the lower bound value @xmath174 for the time exponent of the impedance , leading to @xmath175 ( whose resemblance to the rouse time is a coincidence  note that with hydrodynamics rouse time loses all relevance ) .",
