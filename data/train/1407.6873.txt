    "galaxy interactions and mergers play important roles in the formation and evolution of galaxies , as illustrated by the increasing galaxy merger rate at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gravitational interactions between galaxies have significant effects on their morphology and physical states .",
    "the degree of these effects depends on a wide variety of parameters such as collision orbit , collision speed , and relative size .",
    "major mergers , which can lead to significant dynamical and morphological disturbances , are strongly linked to starbursts and agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the 1970 s , it has been long predicted from numerical simulations that the major merger of two disk galaxies results in the formation of a spheroid - dominated early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "this classical scenario is supported by observations of the stellar structures of merger remnants that resemble elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and signatures of past mergers such as shells and tidal features around elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to the classical scenario of merger evolution , recent high - resolution simulations that include more realistic gas physics have shown that not all of the major mergers will become an early - type galaxy , but some will reemerge as a disk - dominated late - type galaxy @xcite . during a merger , any gas that does not lose significant angular momentum through stellar torques will survive the collision , reforming a gaseous ( and subsequently a stellar ) disk @xcite , while gas that falls to the galaxy center will contribute to a nuclear starburst and subsequent formation of the spheroidal component . in galaxy mergers ,",
    "the chance of disk survival during the merging event depends on orbital parameters , mass ratio , and gas mass fraction of the progenitors @xcite .",
    "the same simulations also suggest that increasing the gas mass fraction leads to a more efficient disk survival as there are fewer stars to lose angular momentum to .    in order to check this theoretical prediction and to investigate the evolution of galaxies after a merging event , we have conducted a @xmath1co imaging study of merger remnants in the local universe using millimeter / submillimeter interferometric measurements .",
    "this paper is the first of a series of our study on merger remnants , which includes a summary of the data and focuses on the properties of the molecular gas disk in merger remnants .",
    "the focus of the second paper is to understand the evolution of merger remnants by comparing the properties of molecular gas and stellar component with early - type galaxies ( i.e. atlas3d project ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and late - type galaxies ( i.e. bima - song ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will also investigate the kinematics of diffuse gas using line measurements in a subsequent paper .",
    "merger remnants are completely merged galaxies that still have tidal tails , shells , and loops , which indicate past dynamical interactions .",
    "most previous studies on merger remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) focused on the stellar properties .",
    "this is because the classical scenario , in which a major merger between two disk galaxies forms a new elliptical galaxy , received higher attention .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to characterize the cold molecular disks emerging from mergers by analyzing new high - resolution interferometric co maps for 27 optically - selected merger remnants obtained using the _ atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array _ ( alma ) , _ combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy _ ( carma ) , and _ submillimeter array _ ( sma ) .",
    "we further obtained published and archival interferometric maps from alma , _ plateau de bure interferometer _ ( pdbi ) , and sma , for 10 galaxies to supplement our analysis , forming a grand sample of 37 galaxies .",
    "in addition , new _ nobeyama radio observatory _ ( nro ) 45  m data and published single - dish measurement from the _ five college radio astronomical observatory _ ( fcrao ) 14  m , _ institut de radioastronomie and millimtrique _ ( iram ) 30  m , _ national radio astronomy observatory _ ( nrao )",
    "12  m , and _ swedish - eso submillimeter telescope _ ( sest ) 15  m telescopes were obtained to analyze the total molecular gas content for 32 galaxies , including six galaxies which do not overlap with the sample for interferometric observations .",
    "the low critical density of low @xmath5 co transitions enable tracing diffuse molecular gas , which is distributed in a more extended fashion compared to high @xmath5 co transitions .",
    "thus low @xmath5 co lines are the best tracer for investigating the distribution and kinematics of diffuse molecular gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the properties of our merger remnant sample in section  2 , observational details and data reduction process in section  3 , and new results in section  4 . in section  5 , we characterize the size and the kinematics of the molecular gas by fitting a simple rotating disk model to the interferometric maps .",

    "* rj04 hereafter ) , which is a large - scale observational study of 51 merger remnants in the local universe ( @xmath11 200  mpc ) .",
    "the sample galaxies in rj04 are selected solely based on optical morphology that suggests an advanced merger stage : ( 1 ) tidal tails , loops and shells , ( 2 ) a single nucleus , and ( 3 ) absence of nearby companions , regardless of star formation or agn activities . the stellar components in a majority of their sample have undergone violent relaxation , though seven sources show evidence for incomplete phase mixing ( rj04 ) . their analysis also shows the presence of `` excess light '' in the surface brightness profiles of nearly one - third of their sample , suggesting the effect of central starbursts .",
    "we have obtained new and published interferometric co maps of 37 merger remnants from this parent sample . in addition , we have obtained new and published single - dish co measurements of 26/37 merger remnants to accurately estimate the total co flux .",
    "we note that the exact fraction of these sources that result from a major as opposed to a minor merger is unknown since it is difficult to reverse the chronology and disentangle the exact mass and morphology of the progenitors .",

    "the co distribution is strongly distorted in these six galaxies , and the co emission is not associated with the galactic center in ngc  6052 and ngc  7135 .",
    "in addition , we investigate the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams along the kinematical major axes of 24 galaxies with molecular gas disks ( figure  [ fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "the kinematical major axes are estimated by fitting the co velocity fields .",
    "the pv diagrams reveal that the emission peaks are clearly shifted from the galactic centers in 18/24 galaxies ( see table  [ tab : t6 ] ) , suggesting the presence of a ring and/or a bar .",
    "the pv diagrams of ngc  828 , ugc  2238 , and ngc  7252 show a double peak located at the transition point between rigid rotation and flat rotation , which may signify a spiral and/or a bar structure rather than a ring structure .      in order to quantify the extent of the molecular gas disk , we estimate two types of radii ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) using the integrated intensity maps .",
    "@xmath56 is the radius from the galactic center that encloses the maximum extent of the molecular gas disk , and @xmath57 is the radius from the galactic center which contains 80  % of the total co flux .",
    "we chose this method because most of our attempts to fit an exponential disk were unsuccessful .",
    "in particular , the radial profiles of molecular gas deviate from an exponential profile in the outer regions .",

    "the absence of an obvious systematic correlation allows us to argue that the detection limit does not strongly affect the observed size of the molecular gas .",
    "in addition , there is no significant effect of the different low @xmath5 rotational transitions ( @xmath5 = 10 , 21 , 32 ) on the estimated radii , because the distributions of the co  ( 10 ) , co  ( 21 ) , and co  ( 32 ) are not different in local galaxies such as m51 @xcite , although the distribution may vary in different population of galaxies with extreme co excitation conditions .",

    "these three sources have relatively high fir luminosities ( @xmath63 10@xmath64 ) , suggesting that the molecular gas may eventually become the stellar disk .",
    "however , the timescale for stellar disk formation is related to the complex interplay among gravitational compression , residual gas inflow , shear motion , stellar feedback , and the gas dynamics in the non - axisymmetric potential , and it may not be easy to determine . in order to confirm the formation of stellar disks",
    ", we will have to observe these sources using dense gas and ionized gas tracers at high angular resolution .",
    "in addition , there is no relation between the relative size of the molecular gas disk and fir luminosity for the whole sample ( figure  [ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "while half of the u / lirgs in our sample have compact disks which are consistent with previous studies @xcite , the rest of u / lirgs have extended molecular gas disks .",
    "therefore the formation of extended molecular gas disks is not related to the physical activity that increases the fir luminosity , namely the starburst / agn .",
    "we find that the molecular gas disks in 54  % ( 13/24 ) of the sources are more compact than the @xmath4-band effective radius .",
    "these gas disks may have formed by past gas inflow that was triggered by dynamical instability during the merging event @xcite or dry mergers . since the molecular gas is already concentrated in the nuclear regions as seen in present - day early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the molecular gas disks in 46  % ( 11/24 ) of the sources are larger than the @xmath4-band effective radius .",
    "the frequent occurrence of large gas disks suggest the possibility that merging galaxies can evolve into bulge - dominated late - type galaxies , unless there are further mechanisms to transport the molecular gas toward the central region ( e.g. , nuclear bar ; * ? ? ? * ) and decrease the size of the molecular gas disk . the ubiquitous presence of both compact and extended gas disks is consistent with the numerical predictions that mergers of gas - rich galaxies can produce both early- and late - type galaxy population @xcite .",
    "understanding the process of disk formation is particularly important at high - redshift when morphological segregation into different hubble types begins .",
    "however , the exact formation mechanism of disk galaxies is not well understood .",
    "two commonly adopted scenarios are , major mergers of gas rich progenitor disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or cosmological inflow of low - angular momentum cold gas that eventually settles onto the galactic disks ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent high - sensitivity submillimeter observations and optical integral field spectroscopy reveal the presence of molecular and ionized gas disks in star - forming galaxies at high - redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite classify 5075  % of their sample of @xmath43 = 13 galaxies as disk / spiral galaxies based on the co kinematics and stellar morphology .",
    "an important finding from our co study of merger remnants is the high occurrence rate of molecular gas disks with various sizes , some of which are approaching the size of the milky way disk .",
    "while the surrounding environment and the properties of the progenitor disks may be different at low and high redshifts , this suggests the possibility that a good fraction of what are identified as disk galaxies ( i.e. favoring the cold accretion model ) at high redshifts through rotational kinematics may in fact contain a substantial subset of merger remnants . deep and high resolution imaging of the rest - frame @xmath4-band emission is needed in order to understand the true nature of these sources .",
    "finally , we note that the initial collision of our sample sources probably occurred a few billion years ago ( @xmath21 typical merger timescale ) , and the observational evidence of high ( @xmath32 30% ) gas mass fraction even at z = 0.3 ( 3  gyrs ago ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
