    "numerical cold dark matter simulations predict that the dark matter haloes of galaxies typically have intrinsic shapes with three distinct axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a triaxial shape is characterized by the axis ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which can vary as a function of radius . based on the specific angular momentum inferred from integral - field stellar kinematics ,",
    "early - type galaxies seem to be divided into two classes of fast and slow rotators , different from their morphological classification in ellipticals and lenticulars @xcite .",
    "most fast rotators , including lenticular as well as many elliptical galaxies , which show strong rotation around their photometric minor axis , seem consistent with oblate axisymmetry ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , many of these systems contain bars and also weakly triaxial shapes can not be ruled out . on the other hand ,",
    "the slow rotators , with little or no rotation , are most likely triaxial .",
    "however , all this is based on observed quantities , i.e. , projected onto the plane of the sky , while for the true comparison between galaxies intrinsic properties , and thus the viewing directions are needed .",
    "most early - type galaxies lack thin discs ( in either dust , gas or stars ) , so that typically there is only a weak constraint on the viewing direction from ( mainly ) the observed ellipticity .    determining the intrinsic shape of galaxies is possible by statistical analysis of their observed ellipticities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deficiency of e0 type galaxies immediately rules out that elliptical are perfectly axisymmetric @xcite , even if bars are taken into account . a recent study by @xcite using ellipticities from sdss show that early - type galaxies are weakly triaxial with mean axial ratios of @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "however , these kind of analyses involve rather strong assumptions on the intrinsic shape distribution , and can not determine the shape of individual galaxies .",
    "alternatively , by assuming a functional form for the intrinsic density it is possible to constrain the intrinsic shape of the light distribution of an individual galaxy , given its observed ellipticity and isophotal twist profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general , however , there is a well - known non - uniqueness in the deprojection of the surface brightness even for axisymmetric galaxies not viewed perpendicular to their symmetry axis also called the ` cone of ignorance ' @xcite .",
    "this tells us that it is not possible to constrain the intrinsic shape using only the photometry without making strong assumptions .    nowadays ,",
    "in addition to observations of the surface brightness of early - type galaxies , integral - field spectrographs provide the full line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) as a function of position on the sky @xmath8 . the losvd is commonly parameterized in terms of its velocity moments , resulting in maps of the mean line - of - sight velocity , velocity dispersion and higher - order velocity moments .",
    "can we ( better ) constrain the intrinsic shape , and hence the viewing direction , of galaxies from these two - dimensional photometric _ and _ kinematic observations ?",
    "because the deprojection is degenerate and the conversion from light to mass is complicated when dark matter is present , implying a range of possible gravitational potentials . even ignoring ( or parameterizing ) both these aspects , it is far from evident that the losvd provides enough information to infer the intrinsic shape .",
    "let us first consider three - integral oblate axisymmetric models , i.e. , with a distribution function ( df ) that is a function @xmath9 of the energy @xmath10 , the angular momentum component @xmath11 parallel to the symmetry @xmath12-axis , and a non - classical third integral of motion @xmath13 . in the special case that a galaxy happens to be well approximated by a two - integral df @xmath14 , the density @xmath15 ( in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath12 ) uniquely determines the even part of @xmath14 and the mean streaming @xmath17 in the meridional plane fixes the part of @xmath14 that is odd in @xmath11 @xcite . if both @xmath15 and @xmath18 are known , they define a two - integral df completely . the observed velocity dispersion and higher order velocity moments of the losvd then provide additional information , which for example can be used to constrain the inclination ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this two - integral semi - isotropic result was recently generalized by @xcite using a special class of anisotropic models in which the velocity ellipsoid is assumed to be aligned with cylindrical coordinates , and the anisotropy @xmath19 ( as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be positive and constant within a galaxy .",
    "both assumption are based on an simplified interpretation of fig .  1 in @xcite , and is at most a first - order approximation .    in the realistic case of a three - integral df @xmath9",
    ", it might well be that the full three - variable losvd @xmath8 is needed to determine the df , so that there is no information left to constrain the inclination . using long - slit spectroscopy it was generally impossible to constrain the inclination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initially , the availability of two - dimensional stellar kinematics seem to allow a constraint on the inclination beyond the lower limit from the photometry , even in the case of full three - integral axisymmetric orbit - based schwarzschild models @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite convincingly showed that , after carefully taking into account numerical effects , similar three - integral axisymmetric schwarzschild models at different inclinations above the photometric limit can ( nearly ) all fit the observed losvd within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "@xcite showed that axisymmetric modeling can have signficant systematics in the recovered mass - to - light ratios by modelling triaxial merger remnants with their axisymmetric machinery .",
    "this shows that triaxial modelling is strongly preferred over axisymmetric modelling , as real elliptical galaxies are at least weakly triaxial .    in the triaxial case ,",
    "the df is again a function of three integrals of motion @xmath20 , but the orbital structure in these models is substantially richer than in the oblate axisymmetric models , with four major orbit families , instead of only one .",
    "this introduces a `` fundamental '' non - uniqueness in the recovery of the df : whereas in the oblate axisymmetric case @xmath15 uniquely defines the even part of @xmath14 , in the ( separable ) triaxial case the density @xmath21 does _ not _ uniquely determine the even part of @xmath20 , even though both of these are functions of three variables @xcite .",
    "it is ( yet ) unknown how much specification of @xmath8 can narrow down the range of possible dfs further .",
    "therefore , in the triaxial case it seems to be even harder , if not impossible , to constrain the viewing direction .    however , while mathematically there are an infinite number of deprojections of the surface brightness possible already for oblate axisymmetric systems viewed away from edge - on , in practice only a limited range of deprojections lead to intrinsic density distributions that are considered realistic for galaxies .",
    "similarly , we have shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) that the df in the triaxial case is in practice well recovered at the correct viewing direction using orbit based models . at the same time",
    ", we found in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) that if there is enough complexity in the photometry and/or kinematics it is likely that even the intrinsic triaxial shape is well constrained .",
    "such complexities are for example photometric and kinematic twists , misalignment between the photometric minor axis and kinematic rotation axis ( kinematic misalignment ) and so - called kinematically decoupled components ( kdcs ) . for example",
    ", the velocity field of ngc4365 @xcite shows rotation around the photometric short - axis in the core as well as around the long - axis in the outer parts .",
    "while the central kdc excludes a prolate shape , the global long - axis rotation is not possible in an oblate system , leaving a triaxial intrinsic shape as the only solution ( see also vdb08 )",
    ".    statistical analysis of observed ellipticities and kinematic misalignments can provide an estimate of the intrinsic shape distribution @xcite .",
    "however , this statistical approach requires a large sample of galaxies for which the kinematic misalignment is accurately measured , which is not ( yet ) available . explored the use of the observed ellipticity and kinematic misalignment to constrain the intrinsic shape of individual galaxies , adopting a specfic form for the intrinsic density and streaming motion .",
    "* and references therein ) developed a velocity - field fitting method for individual galaxies based on a solution of the continuity equation , assuming a similar flow which separates the density and streaming motion in a radial and angular part . because this approach is fast the large parameter space can be sampled finely enough to find the most probable solution using bayesian statistics .",
    "however , the method assumes a ( plausible ) solution for the continuity equation , is not self - consistent , and fits the first velocity moment only . by comparison ,",
    "the orbit - based schwarzschild models that we employ allow for general density distributions , are self - consistent , and fit the full losvd . as mentioned above , even with such a general method making optimal use of the state - of - the - art two - dimensional photometric and kinematic observations , it is not evident how well the intrinsic shape can be recovered .    in this paper",
    ", we use a set of realistic ( nearly ) axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models with a three - integral df , to show that an increasing complexity in the corresponding two - dimensional observables indeed leads to a better recovery of the intrinsic shape . in   [ sec : srabelmodels ] , we construct these abel models based on the description of .",

    "these models , with a df @xmath20 that depends on three exact integrals of motion , allow for a large range of shapes and internal dynamics , while the corresponding observables , including the losvd , can be computed efficiently .",
    "they are well suited to simulate realistic imaging and integral - field kinematics of early - type galaxies . here , we construct thirteen galaxy models , six nearly oblate axisymmetric , three nearly prolate axisymmetric and four triaxial .",
    "these galaxy models are representative of early - type galaxies observed with the integral - field spectrograph sauron  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from oblate fast - rotator to triaxial slow - rotator .    as in   4 of",
    ", we use a triaxial isochrone stckel potential with a length scale of @xmath22kpc at the adopted distance of @xmath23mpc , and with a total mass of @xmath24m@xmath25 .",
    "next , we choose the df to be a linear combination of components of the form @xmath26 , where both @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the ( constant ) shape parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , each df component can be one of three types .",
    "the non - rotating ( nr ) type is made of box orbits and tube orbits with both senses of rotation populated equally .",
    "in addition we have two rotating types , long - axis rotating ( lr ) and short - axis rotating ( sr ) , which consist of tube orbits , and have net rotation around the long axis and short axis respectively .",
    "we set @xmath30 and @xmath29 of each component such that the total density is similar to that corresponding to the potential , except in the outer parts ( @xmath31 ) where a steeper surface brightness profile mimics the presence of dark matter ( see also ) .    to calculate the observables we need to choose a viewing direction . for the oblate / prolate axisymmetric models we adopt three inclinations : close to edge - on / side - on @xmath32@xmath33  ( @xmath34 ) , intermediate @xmath35@xmath33  ( @xmath36 ) , and close to face - on / end - on @xmath37@xmath33  ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "for the triaxial models we use polar and azimuthal viewing angles of @xmath39@xmath33 .",
    "we then compute for each df component on a rectangular grid on the sky plane the losvd and fit a gauss - hermite series to obtain maps of the surface mass density @xmath40 , and the mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath41 , velocity dispersion @xmath42 and higher - order gauss - hermite velocity moments up to @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "slow rotator triaxial models ( st1,st2,st3,st4 ) _ the axis ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the density corresponding to the chosen isochrone potential are consistent with a triaxial model .",
    "model st1 only has a nr component with @xmath52 , and hence shows no rotation ( @xmath68 ) , similar to ngc4486 ( m87 ) .",
    "model st2 has an additional sr component with relative mass fraction of 20 per cent , so that @xmath69 .",
    "model st3 has in addition to the nr component a sr component with relative mass fraction of 10 per cent and different shape parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this results in a central compact kpc - size kdc and zero rotation outwards due to the extended nr component , similar to slow rotators like ngc5831 .",
    "the @xmath54 value within the inner @xmath72  rises above @xmath73 , but at larger radii quickly drops within the slow rotator regime . finally , model st4 is the same as model st3 , but with an additional lr component with @xmath74 .",
    "the three nr , sr and lr components have relative mass fractions of 80 , 10 and 10 per cent . outside the kdc",
    ", the model has significant ( long - axis ) rotation , similar to ngc4365 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath54 value stays around @xmath73 in the outer parts .",
    "because the abel models are constructed with a minimum number of df components , they are transparent and relatively quick to calculate , but still they capture most of the rich dynamics observed in early - type galaxies .",
    "moreover , a careful decomposition of the observed sauron  two - dimensional stellar kinematics of early - type galaxies using kinemetry shows that most early - type galaxies can be described by only a few components @xcite . still , due to the sometimes sharp transition between the df components , the surface brightness of the abel models is not always as smooth as the surface brightness of most early - type galaxies .",
    "as a result , the surface brightness of the abel models can not accurately be fitted with smooth parameterizations such as the multi - gaussian expansion method , unless negative gaussians and/or strong twists are invoked .",
    "this would not only be unnatural , but also incorrectly limit the possible deprojections .",
    "nevertheless , the mge parameterization allows for a straightforward deprojection and an efficient computation of the gravitational potential that correspond to the resulting ( triaxial ) intrinsic density .",
    "therefore , we enforce a less accurate but smooth mge parameterizations of the surface brightness of the abel models , and show in   [ ssub : non_smooth_sb ] that this does not affect our main results .",
    "based on the simulated observations of each of the thirteen abel models , we now construct triaxial @xcite models using our numerical code described in detail in .",
    "the code reconstructs the intrinsic dynamical structure of a collisionless stellar system with an arbitrary triaxial geometry by finding the superposition of orbits that best fits simultaneously the ( observed ) photometry and stellar kinematics in a self - consistent way .",
    "these models are significantly different from axisymmetric schwarzschild models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they allow for triaxial intrinsic shapes and the associated multiple distinct orbit families .",
    "hence , they are applicable to many of the early - type galaxies , including very boxy ones , and their triaxial dark haloes .",
    "the models presented in this paper use the default parameters as set in , including the number of orbits and the dimensions of the intrinsic polar mass grid . no regularisation was used throughout this paper , to ensure that the results unbiased towards any form of regularisation .",
    "the stellar kinematics fitted are the maps of the mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath41 , velocity dispersion @xmath42 and higher - order gauss - hermite velocity moments ( up to @xmath43 ) computed for each of the abel models .",
    "in addition , we fit the mge parameterization of surface brightness distribution and the corresponding intrinsic luminosity density for a given viewing direction .",
    "similarly , the intrinsic mass density and gravitational potential is inferred from the deprojected mge parameterization of the surface mass distribution . because the surface mass distribution is not directly observable ( except perhaps in case of gravitational lensing )",
    ", we constructed the abel models such the luminosity density mimics the mass density inside the observed region ( see   [ sec : srabelmodels ] and ) .",
    "essentially , we implicitly assume that mass follows light . unlike the sometimes sharp transitions in the projected luminsity density as mentioned in   [ sec : srabelmodels ] , the projected mass density of the abel models is always smooth and hence accurately parameterized by a mge .",
    "the accelerations in the ( efficiently ) computed mge gravitational potential are accurate to @xmath75 , when compared to the input analytic stckel potential .",
    "the types of orbits hosted by the gravitational potential depend strongly on the intrinsic shape of the galaxy .",
    "this means that the capability of the schwarzschild models to fit the stellar kinematics ( and the photometry in a self - consistent way ) also depends on the intrinsic shape ( see for example fig .",
    "5 of ) . to obtain the intrinsic density distribution from deprojection of the mge parameterization three viewing angles",
    "are needed that are typically unknown : the polar ( @xmath76 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath77 ) viewing angles , and the misalignment angle ( @xmath78 ) between the projected intrinsic short axis and the photometric minor axis .",
    "searching through a uniform grid in these three angles is unfeasible since the deprojection is strongly non - linear .",
    "while in parts of the grid small changes in the viewing angles can result in strong variations in the intrinsic shape , in other regions the intrinsic shape remains nearly constant .",
    "instead , we step through the possible deprojections by regularly sampling three intrinsic shape parameters : the axis ratios @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and a third parameter @xmath30 that represents the scale - length compression factor .",
    "this has the advantage that we can sample the whole deprojection space with relatively few points and avoid sampling in parts of the viewing space where no changes occur , while increasing the sampling density where necessary ( see also   3.7 of ) . for the tests in this paper it is important to consider both the recovery of the viewing angles and the intrinsic shape separately .",
    "as a good constraint on the shape does not nessecarily mean a good constraint on the viewing angles and vice versa .",
    "the ( @xmath81 ) parameters are not equivalent to the stckel @xmath82 and @xmath83 from   [ sec : srabelmodels ] : both describe the intrinsic shape , but the latter describes the intrinsic shape measured directly from the moments of inertia in the isochrone stckel potential ( see   4.1 in ) , whereas ( @xmath81 ) is defined within the mge system .",
    "the range of deprojections , and thus the sampling in the intrinsic shape parameters , is different for each of the galaxy models presented in this paper , as they have a different surface brightness .",
    "typically we have 125 deprojections in steps of 0.05 in @xmath84 , and for each deprojection we sample the mass - to - light ratio",
    "m / l  at eleven different values . in this way",
    ", we construct around 1400 schwarzschild models to the simulated observables of each abel model .",
    "computing the orbit library  which has to be done for every deprojection",
    " takes approximately six hours on a current single - core cpu . for each deprojection and m / l  the fitting takes another hour",
    "this means in total about 2000 cpu hours to search the whole parameter space per abel model .      to determine the best - fit model parameters and corresponding uncertainties we compare for each schwarzschild model its @xmath85 difference between the simulated observables and the corresponding model predictions , weighted with the errors in the observables .",
    "the ( global ) minimum in the @xmath85 yields the best estimate of the model parameters .",
    "it is common practice , e.g. , when dynamical models are used to measure the mass of a black hole , to assign error bars based on @xmath86 and the number of free parameters @xmath87 of the model . in our case we have @xmath88 parameters ( three viewing angles and the mass - to - light ratio ) after marginalizing over the orbital weights . and thus our assiociated formal errors become @xmath89 for 68% confidence ( @xmath90 ) .    whereas for the black hole mass measurements",
    ", with typically only a few observations inside the sphere of influence of the black hole , this works well , a different criterion is needed in our case of measuring the intrinsic shape based on ( simulated ) integral - field spectroscopy observations .",
    "the integral - field spectroscopy observations that are used typically consist of several hundred ( or more ) spectra .",
    "from each spectrum four ( or more ) velocity moments are extracted , yielding a large number of individual constraints @xmath91 , which are fitted by the schwarzschild model . under these circumstances",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath85 itself become important .",
    "the @xmath85 itself has a standard deviation of @xmath92 , which becomes non - neglibible in our case .",
    "moreover , we expect that systematic errors in the observations ( e.g. due to stellar template mismatch ) can cause deviations in the @xmath85 of the order of ( or more than ) the formal @xmath90 .    instead , we derive uncertainties on the best - fit parameters based on the expected standard deviation of @xmath85 , which we approximate to be @xmath93 because @xmath94 . preliminary validation of this approach is shown in , where we construct triaxial schwarzschild models of one abel model ( similar to st4 ) and the elliptical galaxy ngc4365 with an ( apparent ) kinematically decoupled core . in this case and in the current study ,",
    "the viewing angles of the abel models are known , so that this criterion for the standard error bars can be validated .",
    "in figures  [ fig : srfr][fig : srst4 ] , we present for each abel model the simulated observables , the best - fit schwarzschild model , and the schwarzschild model closest to the input parameters .",
    "the difference between the latter two schwarzschild models reveals the ( often small ) differences due to the typical uncertainty allowed in the fitted stellar kinematics ( e.g.  template mismatch errors ) .",

    "although the inner part of the surface brightness is not well reproduced by the smooth mge parameterization , unlike model st3 , the intrinsic shape is nevertheless accurately recovered and constrained , with ranges @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the triaxial abel model used in  and is similar to model st4 , but at a different viewing direction and with more photometric twist in the mge parameterization , resulting in ( slightly ) tighter constraints on the intrinsic shape as well as on the viewing angles .      as mentioned in   [ sec : srabelmodels ] , the surface brightness of the abel models can show a sudden transition between df components , which can not be accurately described by a smooth mge parameterization without invoking negative gaussians and/or strong photometric twists . a way to avoid",
    "this is to bypass the mge and use the observed surface brightness directly .",
    "this means that the intrinsic density is not constrained anymore , since it follows from deprojecting the mge parameterization . in fig .",

    "also many of the deprojections with @xmath110 or @xmath111 are excluded , leading to a significantly tighter constraint on the intrinsic shape then when the mge parameterization is used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : striax2alt ] we also show the same for st2 , for which the effect is less pronounced but still significant : the best - fit model is now much closer with @xmath79 and @xmath80 less than @xmath65 away from their input values , but the confidence intervals are unchanged .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=288 ]    this shows that the mge representation we used in ",
    "[ ssub : the_triaxial_models ] is too smooth , adding irrelevant deprojections that ( artificially ) increase the error bars on @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however , there is a delicate balance between reproducing too little and too much photometric twist .",
    "fitting unrealistic sharp features ( due to for example dust in real observations ) , may exclude allowed deprojections or even the true underlying intrinsic shape . to avoid the latter , the fit to the surface brightness should be as round as possible , while still accurately describing the observed photometry .",
    "in , we have shown that given the correct input viewing direction , the internal dynamics and three - integral distribution function can be recovered . here , we investigate what happens to the intrinsic velocity moments when the viewing angles are allowed to deviate from the input values .",
    "we expect the intrinsic velocity moments , in terms of @xmath112 and velocity anisotropy , to vary when the viewing direction and hence intrinsic shape changes .",
    "still , if we stay within the @xmath90 confidence regions of the fitted intrinsic shape parameters , these variations might be limited due to the constraints coming from the two - dimensional kinematics .",
    "we use model st3 from the previous section as an illustration . in fig .",
    "[ fig : srvsig ] , we show the intrinsic velocity moments at the input values @xmath113 and at @xmath114 , which is at the ( lower ) boundary of the corresponding @xmath90 confidence region ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : striax2alt ] ) .",
    "while the mass density of the two models ( indicated by the black contours ) is clearly different , the intrinsic velocity moments are quite similar .",
    "this suggests that as long as the intrinsic shape is reasonably well constrained , the internal dynamics are also reliably recovered .",
    "we constructed thirteen galaxy models with simulated photometry and two - dimensional stellar kinematics that represent the sauronobservations of early - type galaxies , from oblate fast rotator to triaxial slow rotator .",
    "we fitted realistic three - integral triaxial schwarzschild models to the simulated observables of these abel models and we used the @xmath85 difference to investigate how well the intrinsic shape as well as the mass - to - light ratio can be recovered . due to the large number of observational constraints ( typically @xmath115 ) with possible systematic errors ( e.g.  stellar template mismatch ) in the case of real integral - field observations ,",
    "the commonly used @xmath116 is not useful to estimate the uncertainties on the model parameters .",
    "instead , we showed that the standard deviation @xmath93 works well as a confidence criterion .",
    "the simulated observations of the ( near ) oblate abel models that are not viewed close to face - on strongly excluded triaxial intrinsic shapes with @xmath117 .",
    "the flattening @xmath80 is almost only constrained by the photometry , although the models with more projected rotation provide a slightly tighter constraint since the relative errors in the odd velocity moments are smaller .",
    "this means that for fast - rotator early - type galaxies , which seem to be consistent with oblate axisymmetry , the inclination is not significantly further constrained by current two - dimensional stellar kinematics , consistent with @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the ( near ) prolate abel models that are not viewed close to end - on a triaxial intrinsic shape is strongly excluded with @xmath118 , but the viewing direction is only weakly constrained .    unlike axisymmetric galaxies",
    ", a triaxial galaxy can show twists in both the surface brightness and velocity field ( and in higher - order velocity moments ) , as well as misalignment between the kinematic ( rotation ) axis and the photometric minor axis .",
    "the stronger such features are in the observations , the more accurate the intrinsic triaxial shape can be recovered , often better than in the axisymmetric case . in particular , for the triaxial abel models with a central kdc , @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be recovered within 5% , especially when ( misaligned ) rotation is present in the outer parts .",
    "since such kpc - size kdcs seem typical for the slow - rotator early - type galaxies , we expect that their intrinsic shape can be well estimated from dynamical modeling .",
    "however , when inferring the mass model from a fit to the surface brightness , the fit should be as round as possible to not exclude allowed deprojections , but still accurately describe the photometry , including twists , to avoid artificially increasing the range of allowed intrinsic shapes .",
    "near face - on oblate galaxies and end - on prolate galaxies appear round on the sky and show almost no ( projected ) rotation .",
    "we showed that in these cases , as well as for triaxial galaxies with no intrinsic ( net ) rotation , the best - fit @xmath79 and @xmath80 are still remarkably close to their true values ( typically within 10% ) , but the formal uncertainties are much larger ( typically around 30% ) .",
    "this means that for galaxies that appear round on the sky and show little rotation , the only hope of recovering the intrinsic shape and corresponding viewing direction is through additional constraints such as provided by a thin embedded disc ( in either dust , gas or stars ) .    in all cases ,",
    "the m / l  is correctly recovered , within about 10% when the intrinsic shape is well recovered , increasing up to 20% for the models with a poor constraint on the intrinsic shape .",
    "this is in line with @xcite , who showed that applying axisymmetric schwarzschild models to triaxial merger remnants results in a larger scatter in the recovered m",
    "/ l  compared to oblate remnants . however , as long as generic dynamical models such as our triaxial schwarzschild models are used , the recovery of the m / l  is nearly independent of the underlying intrinsic shape .",
    "this is not unexpected given the good correlation between dynamical and virial m / l  estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the observed tight scaling relations in early - type galaxies such as the fundamental plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in real galaxies",
    "the photometry and the kinematics are usually measured independently and as a result their relative alignment is not perfectly known .",
    "this can create a small kinematic misalignment in an otherwise perfectly axisymmetric galaxy , or vice - versa . to test the significance of this we re - ran the fast rotator oblate model fo2 with a positive and negative misalignment of 2@xmath33 , emulating a typical measurement error on the pa ( in a fairly round galaxy ) .",
    "the resulting recovered parameters and their errors were very similar to the original fo2 model , with the @xmath85 only marginally higher and the @xmath119 confidence region slightly extended .",
    "this shows that the uncertainty in the relative pa in these observations does not effect the recovery of the intrinsic shape nor the recovery of the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "furthermore , we ran seperate models of fo2 and st4 in which we doubled the number of orbits . the resulting models , including the @xmath85 contours and the recovered kinematics , where nearly identical showing that the number of orbits used in our models is sufficient .",
    "we conclude that for ( near ) axisymmetric galaxies the combination of photometric and two - dimensional stellar kinematic observations can strongly exclude triaxiality , but regular kinematics do not further tighten the intrinsic flattening significantly . as a result",
    ", we expect the inclination of fast - rotator early - type galaxies to remain nearly unconstrained above the photometric lower limit , although better observations do seem to slightly decrease the range in inclinations (  [ ssub : soblatemods ] ) .",
    "triaxial galaxies can have additional complexity in both the observed photometry and kinematics , such as the central kdcs observed in many slow - rotator early - type galaxies , which allows the intrinsic shape to be accurately recovered .",
    "the intrinsic shape of round galaxies with no significant rotation is degenerate , unless additional constraints such as from a thin disk are available .",
