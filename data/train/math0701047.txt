    "a model of incompressible , ideal , rigid - plastic material was developed about a hundred years ago . in the two - dimensional case the model",
    "is described by a hyperbolic system of quasilinear equations . in 1920s",
    "prandl , hencky , and mises , among others , suggested a systematic way , named slip - line method ( slm ) , for finding stress fields and associated velocity fields for two - dimensional plain strain deformation problems for rigid - plastic body .",
    "the method is presented in many classic books on plasticity theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) along with its applications to metal forming processes and problems of plastic failure ( limit analysis ) .",
    "solution of a 2d rigid - plastic flow problem by this method is reduced to construction of the field of characteristics ( slip - lines ) . assumed domain of the plastic flow is to be decomposed into a set of subdomains ( patches ) of a priori specified types , and appropriate boundary value problems ( bvps ) , consistent with physics of the process , are stated for each of the subdomains .",
    "the subproblems were usually solved numerically . in 1980s a matrix implementation of the slm , called matrix method , was developed within engineering community @xcite .",
    "the matrix method is based on the assumption that boundary data are defined by real analytic functions .",
    "the solution to each subproblem is obtained by applying appropriate matrix operators to the vector(s ) of coefficients of the data . in @xcite a new , simpler approach to implementation of the matrix method was developed , mathematically justified , and equipped with recurrent definitions of five matrix operators needed for solving main boundary value problems typical in technological applications ( versus twenty operators in the original engineering version of the method ) .",
    "it was also shown that solutions to the subproblems can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions .    in this work",
    "explicit expressions for the five matrix operators of the slip - line analytic technique ( slat ) developed in @xcite are presented .",
    "convergence issues are addressed and model examples are provided .",
    "slat can be used as a source of test problems for numerical methods aimed at problems with discontinuities .",
    "the fact that solutions to problems in plasticity may have singularities along characteristics is well known and experimentally confirmed .",
    "presence of discontinuities is an important feature that can not be easily detected by numerical methods . in general",
    ", capturing singularities is very challenging mathematical problem that is of great interest in many applications , including phase transitions and microstructure formation .",
    "slat also provides examples of analytically solved problems with free boundaries since only a structure of the plastic domain is `` guessed '' a priory and finding the boundary of the domain is part of the solution .",
    "furthermore , although analytic solutions have been superseded with powerful numerical methods , in particular fem , the slip - line analysis is a working tool in metal forming @xcite , granular flow modelling @xcite , and geomechanics @xcite . the velocity field in the hodograph plane can also be found by this method @xcite .",
    "exact solutions for stress and velocity fields can be used to derive analytic expressions for the plastic power , which provides a framework for finding optimal in a certain sense geometric or material parameters of the process under consideration .",
    "slm is also a classic topic in standard courses on plasticity theory , and so is the method of characteristics in pde theory .",
    "therefore the authors believe that an elegant matrix formulation of the method presented in this paper has a good potential in engineering and mathematical education due to simplicity of the material model , lucidity of the basic ideas , and classical character of mathematical machinery .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    "the governing equations for von mises ideal rigid - plastic material under conditions of plain strain deformation are introduced and a classic reduction to quasilinear hyperbolic system of pdes is given . using _",
    "transformation , the system is transformed into the telegraph equation , which means that the original system is c - integrable .",
    "this fact was known long ago @xcite , but here the transformation to the linear problem is done by appropriate change of variables and does not involve any considerations from mechanics . in section 3 three main bvps typical for applied plasticity are defined . using riemann function for the telegraph equation ,",
    "the initial characteristic problem with analytic data can be solved in terms of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "we show that this solution can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions depending on the product of independent variables , which is more practical for computations .",
    "exact solutions for cauchy and mixed problems are found by reducing the problems to equivalent initial characteristic problem . in section 4",
    "the method is applied to two test problems from the theory of plastic flow :    * calculation of the slip - line field generated by two circular arcs , and * computation of the stress state near an elliptic hole loaded with constant normal pressure .",
    "solutions obtained for the test problems are in excellent agreement with those known from literature .",
    "to simplify exposition , the following notations and conventions will be used hereafter .",
    "* @xmath0= @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a variable .",
    "* @xmath3=[1,t_1,t_2,t_3,\\ldots]^t$ ] ( vector - column ) . *",
    "any given function is real analytic ( i.e. , it can be represented as the sum of a power series ) .",
    "* summation is taken over the range from @xmath4 to @xmath5 unless specified otherwise .",
    "* notation @xmath6 stands for the hypergeometric functions .",
    "the subindexes will be omitted for simplicity . *",
    "given a power series @xmath7 notation @xmath8 stands for the row of its coefficients .",
    "let a homogeneous isotropic body made of ideal rigid - plastic material be in a state of plane strain plastic deformation .",
    "assume that the flow is parallel to @xmath9-plane .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the projection of the body onto this plane .",
    "it is assumed that the stress tensor components @xmath11 and the strain rate tensor components @xmath12 in the domain @xmath10 satisfy the following equations :    1 .",

    "each of these lines is tangent to a maximum shear stress direction at this point .",
    "lines in _ the first and the second shear directions _ [ 7 ] are called @xmath18- and @xmath19-lines , respectively . under the plane strain conditions ,",
    "the mean stress @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the stress components at a point @xmath22 are determined by the equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angle from the @xmath25-axis to the @xmath18-line passing through the point .    substituting these equations into ( [ eq : equilib ] ) yields @xmath26 where lower indices indicate corresponding partial derivative .",
    "quasilinear system ( 3 ) is hyperbolic , and its characteristics coincide with slip - lines .",
    "it is shown below that the system can be converted into a linear pde by a hodograph transform reversing the roles of the dependent , ( @xmath27 ) , and independent , ( @xmath28 ) , variables .",
