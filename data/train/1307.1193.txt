    "in the unification scheme of active galactic nulcei ( agns ) , dusty torus plays an important role in the diversity of observational phenomena @xcite . in type 1 agns , observers can directly see the central nuclei and broad line region ( blr ) , which are however obscured by the dusty torus in type 2 agns .",

    "the first bump at optical / ultraviolet region is usually believed to be the thermal emission from accreiton disk , while the second bump at infrared region is thought to be reprocessed emission from dusty torus by absorbing the centeral nuclei emission .",

    "the bias caused by sed sampling may not be severe in optical - uv region , however , there is likely sed undersampling in ir due to sparse wise data . to check the bias caused by ir data sampling , we calculated @xmath96 ir luminosity from the mean quasars sed of @xcite for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , by using same power - law integration method on wise data as done for our samples . while mean sed gives ir luminosity of @xmath99 ,",

    "while there are overestimations on the bolometric luminosity in both high - z and low - z quasar due to the inclusion of line contributions from @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the low - z sources would have additional overestimation of about 0.04 dex from @xmath104 .",
    "however , this factor certainly is not enough to explain the systematical cf difference between high - z and low - z quasars in the overlapped bolometric luminosity .",

    "the larger sample from the next version of boss and future extended boss ( eboss ) will help to study these effects .",
    "the quasars in dr7q catalog were selected as those sources with at least one emission line having fwhm larger than 1000 @xmath28 , while dr9 quasars were selected either display at least one emission line with fwhm larger than @xmath22 or , if not , have interesting / complex absorption features . due to different selection criterions , high - z quasars in dr9q catalog",
    "may likely bias towards type 2 quasars , as they may include a fraction of sources with narrower emission lines than typical type 1 quasars . since type 2 agns are thought to have larger covering factor than type 1 agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this selection bias perhaps will at least partly produce the higher cf in high - z quasars compared to low - z quasars , which are mainly from dr7q catalog .",
    "however , we found that almost all quasars at @xmath114 in dr9q catalog ( @xmath115 ) have fwhm @xmath116 of at least one of mg ii , and c iv lines .",
    "in fact , in our high - z quasar sample , 2048 of 2056 quasars ( @xmath117 ) have fwhm @xmath118 , and there are 962 of total 966 high - z quasars ( @xmath117 ) having fwhm @xmath119 in overlapped bolometric luminosity range .",
    "when restricting fwhm @xmath120 in 960 of 966 quasars , we found a same log cf median value of -0.06 , proving the significant cf difference between these broad line high - z quasars and low - z quasars .",
    "we further check the results by only including quasars with a narrow range of spectral index in the overlapped bolometric luminosity range . in the range of @xmath121",
    ", we found that the cf difference remains significant with median log cf values of -0.11 , and -0.32 for high - z , and low - z quasars , respectively .",
    "the ks test shows a significant difference between high - z and low - z quasars in cf distributions , while there is no strong difference in @xmath11 distributions .",
    "similar results are found in other @xmath11 ranges .",
    "finally , we check the results by comparing high - z quasars with only dr9 low - z quasars .",
    "the median log cf value is -0.31 for low - z dr9 quasars in overlapped @xmath122 range , which confirms the significant difference compared to high - z quasars .",
    "we therefore conclude that the cf difference between high - z and low - z quasars may be less likely caused by the selection bias in dr9q catalog .    for the first time",
    ", the large sample of dr9 quasars enables us to explore the statistical properties of the ir luminosity and then the covering factor for quasars at @xmath123 .",
    "the uniqueness of our sample is that we selected the sources with detections from ir all though to uv from various surveys .",
    "although the sample size is much reduced , our sample is large enough for statistical investigations .",
    "more importantly , the bolometric luminosity can be better constrained with multi - wavelength data in comparison to estimation from uv luminosity at single wavelength ( usually @xmath110 ) or integrated in a narrow uv wavelength range @xcite . due to lack of x - ray measurements , we calculated the bolometric luminosity only in @xmath65 - 1@xmath32 , which however represents majority ( @xmath124 ) of the overall bolometric luminosity in 1 @xmath32 - 10 kev according to the mean quasar sed of @xcite . instead of calculating torus ir luminosity using certain models @xcite",
    ", we obtain the ir luminosity from direct power - law integrations , which is basically same to @xcite and @xcite . while we have proved that the ir luminosity calculation wo nt bring significant systematic bias when comparing high - z to low - z quasars , it is certainly also true in each populations , since the redshift range is rather narrow in each sample .",
    "benefiting from our source selection , the dispersion of the relationship between ir and bolometric luminosity is much less than that of @xcite at similar redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ irbol ] ) , although their ir luminosity is in @xmath125 range .",
    "we have shown that the anti - correlations between the covering factor and bolometric luminosity follow different tracks for high - z and low - z quasars , while their covering factor cover similar range ( see fig .",
    "[ irbol ] ) .",
    "the overlapped bolometric luminosity , actually corrsponds to the high luminosity end of low - z quasars , while it s low luminosity end of high - z ones .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to see a higher covering factor of high - z quasars at overlapped bolometric luminosity . while the anti - correlation between the covering factor and bolometric luminosity has been found in various occasions and different scenarios have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found a higher covering factor in high - z quasars , implying an evolution of covering factor with redshift .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings that the fraction of obscured agns increases significantly with redshift in hard x - ray selected samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the merger scenario , the merger triggers the star fromation and quasar activity as well .",
    "the quasars finally will blow away the surrounding dust and gas , and outshine the host galaxy . at that time ,",
    "plenty of materials supply to the central accretion process and formation of quasar structures .",
    "an increase of the covering factor at high redshift could be naturally expected by the larger gas contents and associated with the enhanced star formation rates in high - z galaxies , which was also observed in the host galaxies of high - z agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by constructing seds for a sample of 5996 quasars at redshift @xmath0 or @xmath1 from sdss dr9q and dr7q catalogs , the covering factor of the dusty torus is estimated as the ratio of the ir luminosity to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we found significant anti - correlations between the covering factor and bolometric luminosity , both in high - z and low - z quasars , however they follow different tracks . at the overlapped bolometric luminosity , the covering factor of high - z quasars are systematically larger than those of low - z quasars , implying an evolution of covering factor with redshift .",
