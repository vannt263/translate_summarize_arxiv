    "the selection of collective variables is an important problem in the study of large amplitude collective motion . in the constrained hartree - fock ( chf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( chfb ) calculations ,",
    "the collective subspaces are generated by a small number of one - body constraint ( also called generalised cranking ) operators which are most commonly taken to be multipoles that can be represented as homogeneous polynomials in the coordinates , i.e. , @xmath0 . in realistic calculations of processes such as fission",
    ", the number of coordinates needed to describe the full nuclear dynamics can easily become larger than what can be dealt with in satisfactory manner , and a method to determine the optimal combination needs to be devised .",
    "furthermore , there is no _ a priori _ reason to limit oneself to multipole operators , and the cranking operators should be determined by the nuclear collective dynamics itself , from amongst all possible one - body operators .    in our past work ,",
    "we have investigated a theory of adiabatic large amplitude collective motion as a method to generate such self - consistent collective subspaces ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the key ingredient of the method is the self - consistent determination of the constraint operator , and as such it may provide an answer to the selection question discussed above . using the local harmonic version of the theory @xcite , the local harmonic approximation ( lha ) , we have recently embarked on a study of the properties of large amplitude collective motion in systems with pairing .",
    "so far we have dealt with two simple models : the first one is a semi - microscopic model of nucleons interacting through a pairing force , coupled to a single harmonic variable @xcite .",
    "the second @xcite is a fully microscopic @xmath1 model which may be regarded as a simplified version of the pairing - plus - quadrupole ( p+q ) hamiltonian studied in this paper .",
    "it has turned out that the self - consistent collective coordinate obtained by the lha accounts quite well for the exact dynamics of the models .",
    "we have also shown that the chfb calculations using the mass - quadrupole operator as the constraint operator can result in incorrect results @xcite .    in this paper , which is an attempt to move towards realistic nuclear problems , we will encounter some problems that need to be resolved first : the main problem is the treatment of conservation laws . in studies of large amplitude collective motion ,",
    "the mean - field states often do not have the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "then , the spurious ( nambu - goldstone ) degrees of freedom , such as the translation and rotation of nucleus , inevitably appear , which must be properly separated out from the other collective degrees of freedom like nuclear shape change . in the models discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the spurious degrees of freedom could be removed by hand thanks to the simplicity of the models , however in realistic nuclear problems , it is almost impossible to do so .",
    "the second and more obvious problem is the increase in the number of degrees of freedom . within the time - dependent hartree - bogoliubov ( tdhb )",
    "approximation , the dynamics of the models of refs .",
    "@xcite is described by only a modest number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath2 ) . for realistic problems in heavy nuclei ,",
    "on the other hand , we need to deal with at least tens of thousands , and possibly millions of degrees of freedom !",
    "these two points , the effect of the conservation laws and the applications to realistic problems , are the main issues discussed in sec .  [ sec : formalism ] .    in the lha , the collective path ( or collective manifold for more than one coordinate ) is determined by solving the chfb problem with a cranking operator which is self - consistently determined by the local random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "it is of course a well - known fact that the spurious modes decouple from the physical modes in the rpa .",
    "however this is true only when the system is at a minimum of the mean - field potential .",
    "since the local rpa needs to be solved at non - equilibrium points as well , we need to study the properties of the lha equations .",
    "it will be shown that the symplectic version of the lha combined with an extended adiabatic approximation properly takes account of conservation laws .",
    "it will also be shown that this formalism naturally explains the role of the chemical potential term @xmath3 in the hamiltonian of the quasiparticle rpa .",
    "since the lha procedure requires one to solve the local rpa at large number of points along the collective path ( manifold ) , the large dimension of the rpa matrix for realistic problems leads to very heavy computational burdens .",
    "thus , instead of solving the local rpa , we would like to preselect a small group of operators , and find the rpa modes as an optimal combination of these operators at each point of the collective surface .",
    "this means that we restrict the rpa diagonalisation to this small space , rather than deal with the full millions - by - millions rpa matrix @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to find a set of one - body operators which approximate well the self - consistent cranking operator .",
    "the pairing - plus - quadrupole ( p+q ) hamiltonian is adopted for the analysis because the rpa calculation is relatively easy due to the separability of the force ( some of the results for the sm isotopes have already been reported in ref .",
    "since the p+q model is known to be able to describe collective phenomena involving both pairing and quadrupole degrees of freedom @xcite , we expect that a similar choice for the set of one - body operators should work for other realistic hamiltonians as well .    the p+q model is probably one of the most simple and successful nuclear hamiltonians which allows us to discuss realistic problems involving pairing and quadrupole degrees of freedom .",
    "baranger and kumar analysed in great detail the ( adiabatic ) collective motion in the p+q model assuming that the collective variables are the mass quadrupole operators @xcite .",
    "thus , they reduced the large number of two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) degrees of freedom ( for this model of the order of a thousand ) to only two `` collective '' coordinates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , our previous study of the @xmath1 model@xcite suggests that even for such simple hamiltonians , the self - consistent collective coordinates are often not as simple as one might think . the p+q model ( with an additional quadrupole pairing interaction )",
    "has also been studied by kishimoto and tamura @xcite using boson expansion techniques .",
    "they found that the coupling to ( non - collective ) 2qp excitations is very important , which also suggests that the collective coordinates are not just the mass - quadrupole ones . in this paper",
    "we show that the normal - mode coordinate of the random - phase approximation is quite different from the mass - quadrupole operator , and how the structure of the self - consistent collective coordinates changes as the nucleus is deformed .    in sec .",

    "in contrast with the formula , the rpa normal - mode coordinates are self - consistently determined by diagonalising the rpa matrix .",
