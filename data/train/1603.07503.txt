    "the physicists fascination with time inversion goes back a long time , as testified by the famous 19th - century argument between loschmidt and boltzmann concerning the arrow of time @xcite .",
    "deep theoretical and metaphysical considerations are not the sole reasons behind it , though .",
    "the pioneering work of hahn in 1950 @xcite , in which the dynamics of an ensemble of nuclear spins was successfully time inverted , gave birth to the concept of spin echo , now central to numerous imaging techniques @xcite .",
    "a spin echo , at least in its most basic form , can be understood in terms of `` population reversal '' in two - level systems : an ensemble of initially uniformly aligned spins precesses around an applied magnetic field , progressively losing relative phase coherence ; a microwave @xmath0-pulse is then used to simultaneously flip the spins , which effectively evolve `` back in time '' regaining ( `` echoing '' ) the initially aligned , phase coherent configuration .",
    "another successful approach to time inversion has been developed for classical waves based on time - reversal mirrors implemented with acoustic @xcite , elastic @xcite , electromagnetic @xcite and recently water waves @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that any wave field can be completely determined in a volume by knowing only the field at any enclosing surface ( a spatial boundary ) .",
    "it requires the use of receiver - emitter antennas positioned on the surface that record an incident wavefront and later rebroadcast a t - inverted copy of the signal .",
    "if an initially localised pulse , e.g. a wave emitted from any source , is left to evolve for a certain time and then in this manner t - inverted on a boundary , it can trace its way back to the initial source and there refocus or `` echo '' @xcite .",
    "note that this process is difficult to implement in optics because of the lack of controllable antennas @xcite , and the standard solution to create time - reversed waves is to work with monochromatic light and use non - linear regimes such as three - wave or four - wave mixing @xcite .",
    "a potent alternative to wave field control via spatial boundaries is the manipulation of time boundaries @xcite .",
    "explicit time reversal protocols for one - dimensional ( 1d ) propagation were proposed for the kicked rotator model of atomic matter waves @xcite and for electromagnetic waves @xcite , the latter based on time- and space - modulated perturbations of a photonic crystal with linear dispersion .",
    "the latest development in this context is the concept of an instantaneous time mirror , which has been verified experimentally @xcite in the field of gravity - capillary waves .",
    "a sudden modification of water wave celerity obtained from a vertical acceleration of a bath of water creates a time - reversed wave .",
    "this time disruption realises an instantaneous time mirror in the entire space .",
    "such a mirror can be viewed as the analogue in time to a standard mirror that acts on space .    in view of these various successful concepts for time reversal of classical wave fields there",
    "remains the long - standing challenge to devise @xmath1-inversion protocols for quantum wave functions .",
    "in other words , are quantum time mirrors ( qtms ) feasible for spatially extended quantum waves , beyond the hahn echo for spin ?",
    "a direct adaption of the aforementioned classical wave strategies appears difficult : on the one hand , recording and properly re - emitting waves would require to measure and thereby massively change the quantum state ; on the other hand , the intriguing concept of a time mirror for water waves can not be directly transferred to wave functions due to the inherently different structure of the underlying differential equations : the classical wave equation and schrdinger equation .    here",
    "we show that , still , it is indeed possible to devise ( instantaneous ) qtms for the time evolution of wave functions .",
    "we propose two concepts of qtms based on completely different physical principles .",
    "the first qtm concerns a ( bosonic or fermionic ) dirac - like system , such as graphene , and is based on the `` population reversal '' principle at the heart of spin echoes . as such",
    ", this approach unifies two up to now distinct paradigms , the @xmath1-inversion of a spatially extended wave and the generation of a ( pseudo)spin echo .",
    "fig.[fig : hbar ] gives a taste of its effectiveness : an initially @xmath2-shaped wave packet evolves in time progressively losing its profile , until the action of the instantaneous qtm , a short pulse at @xmath3 apparently inverts the propagation and leads to a distinct echo at @xmath4 ; the subsequent echo at @xmath5 is due to a further qtm pulse at @xmath6 .",
    "the second qtm we propose is non - linear , acting on a bose - einstein condensate cloud whose dynamics is described by the non - linear schrdinger equation . in both settings",
    "almost perfect wave function echoes can be generated , and we discuss the appropriate parameter ranges for this to happen .",
    "in particular , lithium bose - einstein condensates appear perfectly suited for the implementation of the non - linear qtm .",
    "-shaped wave packet ( at @xmath7 ) becomes completely blurred when propagating until @xmath3 .",
    "a fast quantum time reversal pulse at @xmath3 leads to a nearly perfect echo at @xmath4 .",
    "the last panel ( at @xmath5 ) shows a second echo after a further subsequent pulse at @xmath8 . ]",
    "let us start by considering a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac - weyl system .",
    "this could describe fermions in real@xcite and artificial@xcite graphene , surface states of topological insulators@xcite , dirac plasmons in metallic nanoparticle lattices@xcite , polaritons in a honeycomb lattice@xcite and possibly eigenmodes of acoustic graphene@xcite near the @xmath9-points .",
    "in such a system the velocity is constant  it does not depend on the @xmath10-vector  and equal in magnitude , but opposite in direction on the upper and lower dirac cones .",
    "our @xmath1-inversion protocol aims at inducing a `` population reversal '' , say from the upper to the lower dirac cone , which corresponds to an inversion of the velocity and thus effectively a propagation back in time .",
    "this can be achieved by applying a short , spatially uniform perturbation opening a gap in the spectrum : once initial upper cone states suddenly find themselves in the forbidden gap region , they start rabi - like oscillations between the upper and lower branches of the spectrum ( corresponding to zitterbewegung in the dirac equation for particles and holes ) .",
    "a proper tuning of such oscillations ensures that , by the time the perturbation is switched off and the gap closes , the states will end up in the lower dirac cone .",
    "this process requires a non - adiabatic perturbation as quantified below .",
    "the effective dirac hamiltonian reads @xmath11 where ( the mass term ) @xmath12 acts as the time - dependent perturbation which temporarily opens a gap .",
    "the eigenenergies and eigenstates of @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the polar angle in @xmath10-space . during the pulse the eigenenergies of h are @xmath17 . in the time interval @xmath18 ,",
    "an initial @xmath13 eigenstate is subject to rabi - like oscillations , whose cycle depends on the pulse strength @xmath19 and length @xmath18 . the amplitude @xmath20 to end up in the counter - propagating @xmath13 eigenstate at @xmath21 after the pulse can be tuned by adjusting both parameters . a straightforward calculation yields ( see supplementary note 1 ) @xmath22 where we introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitude needs to be maximised for optimal echo strength , which then requires @xmath25 , @xmath26 , corresponding to @xmath27 for @xmath28 . in general , given an initial wave packet @xmath29 , a convenient measure of the echo strength is given by the correlation @xmath30 between the moduli of the amplitudes at times @xmath31 and @xmath1 .    to illustrate the qtm effect ,",
    "a complicated wave packet resembling @xmath2 is numerically propagated in time ( see fig . [",
    "fig : hbar ] ) by a wave packet propagation algorithm ( see methods ) . at times",

    "[ fig : graphene]a ) , showing the corresponding correlation . at the echo time",
    "( @xmath39 ) , major parts of the time propagated wave packet indeed return to the initial position .",
    "our qtm mechanism is not limited to a single pulse : subsequent kicks at @xmath6 and @xmath40 cause further peaks , albeit of decreasing size .    the distinct echo peaks are based on the linear dispersion relation , implying no wave packet spreading and a @xmath10-independent absolute value of the velocity ( see supplementary note 1 ) . furthermore the kinetic phases accumulated by each @xmath10-mode during forward ( @xmath41 ) and backward ( @xmath42 ) propagation add up to zero .",
    "for an arbitrary wave packet , the echo strength @xmath43 is analytically given solely in terms of the amplitude @xmath44 and the wave packet at @xmath45 as @xmath46    , equation , obtained from numerical propagation of the @xmath2-wave , see fig .",

    "one finds extended stripes of high fidelity . to check this analytical result we simulate the propagation of a normalised 2d gaussian wave packet with positive energy and small @xmath10-space width @xmath55 compared to the mean absolute value @xmath56 of its wave vector , such that @xmath57 for all @xmath10-modes involved",
    "under these assumptions , equation   reduces to @xmath58 ( see supplementary note 1 ) , which can be compared with the correlation @xmath43 , equation  , obtained from full numerical time evolution . as the mean difference between analytics and numerics is @xmath59 , only the analytical plot is shown .",
    "let us now investigate the qtm robustness to disorder , typically present in a real system . for the sake of clarity we keep the discussion at a qualitative level , and refer to supplementary note 2 , for quantitative details .",
    "we consider two types of disorder : a static spatial disorder potential , as well as a spatially random pulse strength ( referred to as `` gap disorder '' ) .",
    "spatial disorder enters into the hamiltonian as a time- and ( pseudo)spin - independent potential @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the unit matrix in ( pseudo)spin - space .",
    "gap disorder is instead given by @xmath62 for @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _  only during the pulse .",
    "both random potentials are gaussian distributed with width @xmath64 or @xmath65 . clearly , the echo is more sensitive to a static random impurity potential than to gap disorder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene]a ) .",
    "this is expected , and can be understood within the framework of loschmidt echo theory @xcite : if a @xmath1-inversion protocol is not perfect , the echo signal decays as a function of the propagation time @xmath32 .",
    "spatial disorder reduces the fidelity , since the qtm mechanism , even for an optimally calibrated pulse , achieves `` population reversal '' without directly affecting the impurity scattering dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the protocol does not involve @xmath66 .",
    "gap disorder plays in principle a similar qtm - breaking role .",
    "however , and contrary to spatial disorder , it is active only during the very short pulse duration time @xmath67 and thus causes only negligible echo losses , reflected in the prefect agreement of the black line and dotted red line in fig .",

    "we take @xmath77 to be a @xmath78-function in our analytical calculations and a gaussian peak @xmath79 in all numerical simulations .",
    "the pulse length @xmath67 is @xmath80 and @xmath81 in one and two dimensions , respectively .",
    "wave packet dynamics in the presence of an infinitesimally short non - linear kick , @xmath82 , can be described as follows .",
    "rescaling @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , we write the non - linear schrdinger equation in a dimensionless form as @xmath87 the evolution of the wave function from @xmath88 at @xmath7 to its value @xmath89 right before the kick is given by @xmath90 where the integration runs over the infinite @xmath68-dimensional space , and @xmath91 } $ ] is the free - particle propagator .",
    "the non - linear kick results in an instantaneous change of the wave function from @xmath92 at @xmath93 to @xmath94 at @xmath95 . indeed , during the time interval @xmath96 ,",
    "the wave function transformation is dominated by the second term in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ nlse ] ) , and effectively governed by the differential equation @xmath97 , the solution of which is given by equation  ( [ psi_jump ] ) .",
    "after the kick , the wave function evolves freely , so that @xmath98 for all times @xmath99 .    as evident from equation  ( [ psi_jump ] ) , the instantaneous non - linear kick alters the phase of the wave function without producing any probability density redistribution , so that @xmath100 $ ] . a straightforward evaluation of the current right after the kick , @xmath101 $ ] , yields @xmath102 where @xmath103 $ ]",

    "topological insulators @xcite open up the intriguing perspective to unify the two mechanisms of spin - echo and orbital echo : states at the surface of a 3d topological insulator are governed by an effective dirac equation similar to graphene where , most notably , the electron spin takes the role of graphene pseudospin .",

    "on the other hand we demonstrated that the @xmath1-inversion protocol is fairly robust to elastic disorder and practically insensitive to pulse ( gap ) disorder . more generally , in analogy to the spin echo , qtm - based echo spectroscopy could be used as a probe of elastic and inelastic scattering times in dirac - type 2d crystals .    for the non - linear qtm we provide an estimate for values of the dimensionless relevant parameters @xmath116 and @xmath10 , accessible in laboratory experiments with ultracold lithium atoms .",

    "with disorder the phase due to the random potential @xmath233 is not inverted and therefore not cancelled after the pulse on the way back .",
    "this leads to a `` dephasing '' , so that contributions from various paths @xmath229 survive at each impurity .    for a more quantitative discussion we turn to the theory of loschmidt echoes ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the role of disorder has been thoroughly studied and characterised . in this context",
