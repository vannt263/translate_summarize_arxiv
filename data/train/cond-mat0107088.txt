    "the bar attendance model ( bam ) @xcite and the minority game ( mg ) ( see refs.@xcite - @xcite ) have recently became regular testing grounds to investigate how the individual actions of a system of independent agents give rise to some kind of macroscopic ordering . in the mg ,",
    "the agents have to make a binary decision which for the sake of concreteness , it is usually taken to be associated to going or not going to a bar .",
    "the winning option is that of the minority .",
    "the mg is a particular case of the bam which has in turn been introduced to show how an ensemble of agents that perform inductive reasoning can self organize to match some condition that is generally accepted to be the most adequate . in the case of the bam this corresponds to the largest acceptable attendance without incurring in some discomfort .",
    "both models have been compared with each other in refs.@xcite and @xcite working out a generalized version of the mg ( the gmg)in order to consider situations in which the minority is replaced by _ an arbitrary fraction _ @xmath0 of the ensemble of players .",
    "this is fixed externally as a control parameter . in all these models",
    "the players update their attendance probabilities with a random correction , depending upon the past record of successes and failures .",
    "asymptotic stable configurations are always reached .",
    "these are , however , of quite different nature depending upon the values of the control parameters , of the initial conditions and on the updating rules involved in each model .    in the present work we are interested in the cases in which the asymptotic stable distribution can be assimilated to a kind of thermodynamic equilibrium . in these situations",
    "the agents continue to update their attendance probabilities but the corresponding probability density distribution remains stationary .",
    "the stochastic dynamics that has been developed for the bam in ref.@xcite always leads the system to these type of configurations while in the cases studied for the gmg , when @xmath1 is significantly larger ( or smaller ) than 1/2 , the system gets stuck in quenched configurations that strongly depend upon the initial conditions .",
    "updating stops because agents have accumulated a great number of successes .",
    "however , these  glassy \" states can nevertheless be  melted \" into equilibrium if the memory of past successes is repeatedly eliminated in an iterative process that can be assimilated to an annealing procedure .",
    "a remarkable result that has been obtained in all numerical simulations is that the equilibrium configuration entails a diversity in the individual actions .",
    "the population is drastically partitioned into two subsets , one that always goes to the bar and the other that never goes .",
    "it therefore seems that in spite of the fact that the agents do not exchange information , they manage to coordinate their actions to proceed in two opposite ways .",
    "the number of agents in both subsets are in a ratio that is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "such polarization is not an intuitive result .",
    "a nave guess is to assume that all agents should choose the same probability of attendance and this should be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "however this turns out to be not a stable distribution because parties that are larger or smaller than the accepted crowding occur with a great chance .",
    "the fact that all agents adjust their attendance probabilities in order to minimize their failures ( i.e. to go when the bar is crowded or not go when the bar is empty ) leads to an aggregate behavior that minimizes a global cost associated to inadequate attendances .",
    "we propose to express such cost by the second moment of the attendance with respect to the acceptable level @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effects of introducing that cost function in the relaxation dynamics of the system .",
    "we show that this is a lyapunov function for the many agent system , i.e. it is possible to derive a deterministic dynamics as the descent along its gradient , that monotonically reduces its value .",
    "this corresponds to a heavily coordinated , synchronous evolution .",
    "we prove that the cost function meets the requirements of an internal energy of the many agent system .",
    "we also introduce a temperature parameter through a langevin - like approach that can be defined in terms of the fluctuations of the attendance strategies . except for finite size effects this",
    "can be proven to be an intensive parameter .",
    "we also superimpose thermal fluctuations to the deterministic dynamics mentioned above . depending upon the amplitude of these fluctuations ,",
    "the polarization is gradually smeared until a point in which completely disappears .    the thermally modified , relaxation process that we define here is completely different from those involved in the gmg or bam approaches that involve the independent and uncoordinated actions of all the agents .",
    "the latter involves a random updating of individual attendance strategies governed by a ( small ) uncertainty amplitude that is interpreted as the precision of such updating .",
    "we prove that in the limit of low temperature , and small uncertainty amplitude both dynamics lead to entirely equivalent asymptotic equilibrium configurations .",
    "the thermal interpretation of the uncertainty amplitude also allows to cast the annealing process presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite into a thermal framework as the well known case of simulated annealing @xcite .    in section",
    "ii we derive the cost function , and in section iii we investigate the dynamics that corresponds to the descent along its gradient . in section iv we present a langevin approach to define the temperature in terms of the fluctuations that are present in the asymptotic equilibrium configuration . in sec .",
    "v we compare this with more traditional approaches for the relaxation process . in section",
    "vi we draw the conclusions .",
    "consider a set of @xmath3 agents that have a probability @xmath4 to go to the bar .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath5 s is given by the probability density function @xmath6 .",
    "as we shall shortly explain the @xmath5 are updated in time according to some dynamics and therefore the function @xmath6 also changes in time .    in the ordinary rules of the gmg when a player goes to the bar and",
    "finds it is crowded or when she does not go and the bar is empty , loses a point .",
    "if the opposite happens she gains a point .",
    "the level of crowding is specified by the value of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "when her account of points falls below zero she updates her attendance probability choosing at random a different value within the interval @xmath7 .",
    "when equilibrium is reached , the resulting distribution @xmath6 concentrates the population in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath8 and @xmath9 plus an almost vanishing contribution from intermediate values .",
    "the ratio of the areas below these two peaks is close to @xmath10 .",
    "the aggregate behavior is associated to the density distribution @xmath11 that gives the probability of occurrence of a party of @xmath12 customers attending the bar .",
    "the function @xmath13 is of course completely determined by @xmath6 . in order to calculate it",
    "let us assume without loss of generality that all the agents distribute themselves into @xmath14 different bins of @xmath15 agents each , with strategies @xmath16 .",
    "the density distribution @xmath6 can then be written as :    @xmath17    with this assumption , the distribution @xmath18 can be written as :    @xmath19    we define the cost function for the whole ensemble of agents as in ref.@xcite , namely as the second moment @xcite with respect to the tolerated crowding level @xmath0 :    @xmath20    in order to calculate it , we introduce eq .",
    "( [ distrigrupo ] ) into the definition of eq.([costo ] ) and perform first the summation over @xmath12 taking advantage of the @xmath21 .",
    "once this is done , one can perform the summations involved in each of the terms in which @xmath22 splits down .",
    "the summations over different @xmath23 s decouple from each other and result either in a 1 ; or in @xmath24 ; in @xmath25 or in @xmath26 .",
    "these terms can be gathered again to yield :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 stands for @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "the expression of @xmath31 given in eq .",
    "( [ costo2 ] ) contains no assumption about the system being in equilibrium .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 instead of being proportional to the size @xmath3 of the system , as befits to an extensive magnitude .",
    "the numerical simulations however indicate that in equilibrium @xmath33 and therefore this term cancels except for possible fluctuations .",
    "actually the @xmath34 term is eliminated by any distribution @xmath6 whose mean has the required value @xmath0 .",
    "for an initial condition with uniformly distributed @xmath5 s and @xmath35 , as it is used for most simulations , the cost is @xmath36 .",
    "such initial condition is a good guess for the final distribution when @xmath37 ( as for the most traditional settings of the mg ) , but it is indeed very poor for the gmg when @xmath38 . in the next sections we discuss in greater detail the value of @xmath31 in equilibrium .",
    "the nave guess @xmath39 is also seen to cancel the @xmath34 terms in @xmath31 .",
    "however such distribution causes that parties with @xmath12 close to , but different from @xmath40 occur with a sizable probability .",
    "the @xmath41 in @xmath31 are minimized precisely when the probability of occurrence of such parties tends to zero by polarizing the population into two subsets with opposite attendance strategies .",
    "to see this we approximate the two peaked equilibrium distribution that is usually obtained in numerical simulations by    @xmath42    one readily sees that the @xmath34 terms are eliminated when @xmath43 and the @xmath41 terms are also eliminated if the two peaks are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the relaxation dynamics that tends to minimize individual losses is therefore seen to also optimize the global cost function defined in eqs .",
    "( [ costo ] ) and ( [ costo2 ] )",
    "all the agents of the system , through uncoordinated actions minimize the total cost @xmath31 that is an aggregate function defined for the whole system .",
    "this fact suggests an alternative representation of the actions of the agents as a synchronous , deterministic dynamics associated to the descent along the gradient of @xmath31 .",
    "this is described by the following set of coupled differential equations for the @xmath5 s :    @xmath46 \\label{motion}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) @xmath47 stands for a positive free parameter that - as we shall shortly see - provides the scale for the time evolution of the system .",

    "( [ costo2 ] ) are translated into a fast and a slow dynamics that involve corrections of the @xmath5 that are respectively @xmath41 and @xmath48 . to see this we first derive the dynamics followed by @xmath49 by calculating the average over @xmath50 in both sides of eq [ motion ] .",
    "we thus obtain :    @xmath51    where we have set @xmath52",
    ". this can explicitly be integrated .",
    "the solution is :    @xmath53    with @xmath54 standing for the initial value of @xmath55 .",
    "this expression allows in turn to find an approximate solution of the equations of motion for the individual @xmath5 s .",
    "to this end we write an asymptotic approximation of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) in which we assume that a long enough time has elapsed so that @xmath56 can be approximated by the constant term of @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ valormedio ] ) . by keeping only the leading order in @xmath3",
    "we obtain :    @xmath58    note that dependence of @xmath59 involves a _ positive _ exponential .",
    "however , this equation is not valid for @xmath60 because the fact that the @xmath5 s are probabilities , and are therefore bounded between 0 and 1 , it is not included in the equations but rather in the boundary conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ motion ] ) .",
    "eqs.([evolmedio ] ) and ( [ pindep ] ) correspond respectively to the fast and slow dynamics that have been mentioned above . in the first place",
    "we see that except for terms that are @xmath57 , @xmath49 approaches @xmath0 exponentially with the very short time constant @xmath61 that tends to zero as the system involves a larger number of individuals . on the other hand , the differences @xmath62 instead _ grow _ exponentially for all @xmath50 indicating that the @xmath5 s _ depart _ exponentially from the average @xmath0 and eventually saturate at its largest or smallest possible values : 1 or 0 , thus polarizing the population of agents .",
    "this process however takes place with a time constant @xmath63 , that is @xmath41 longer than the one involved in the evolution of @xmath49 and is independent of the size of the system . while the average @xmath49 approaches very fast to the value @xmath0",
    ", the individual @xmath5 s _ depart _ slowly from the same value .",
    "eqs.([motion ] ) can be tested numerically by approximating them by finite differences .",
    "the individual attendance probabilities @xmath5 are thus taken to be updated as @xmath64 where :    @xmath65 \\label{dinamica}\\ ] ]    the resulting density distributions @xmath6 that are obtained with this dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ minimizacion ] . the value of @xmath47 and therefore that of the time constant @xmath66 is in principle arbitrary .",
    "however if @xmath67 the only effects that are noticeable are those of the fast dynamics while if @xmath68 the descent towards the minimum keeps bouncing at opposite sides of the quadratic well and never reaches its bottom .",
    "when @xmath69 the descent is gradual enough so that the interplay of both terms in @xmath70 leads the system to a minimum of @xmath31 .    the intermediate stages in the gradient descent are also shown in fig .",
    "[ minimizacion ] . in the first few steps the ( fast ) uniform correction of @xmath41",
    "is seen to shift rigidly the initial distribution to one side with the aim of adjusting the value of @xmath49 to that of @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", agents are piled up in one end while the other is completely cleared .",
    "once the leading term in @xmath31 is nearly canceled , the slow dynamics gradually gathers agents at _ both _ ends of the distribution producing minor fluctuations in the value of @xmath49 .",
    "the density distribution @xmath6 that is finally obtained is seen to correspond to a strongly polarized population thus reproducing the main feature of the equilibrium distributions obtained with the rules traditionally used in the gmg or the bam .",
    "the present approach yields a density distribution that displays the same polarization that is found in the gmg or in the bam .",
    "it is remarkable that such a general qualitative agreement is found , although those frameworks differ deeply from the deterministic formulation .",
    "the conceptual difference between the two approaches lies in the special role played by the record of successes and failures that is kept in the bam or gmg and that is completely absent in the present treatment .",
    "the usual rules of the gmg can thus be considered to correspond to a dynamics constrained by the ( positive ) balance of points that have been accumulated in the past instances of the game .",
    "there are other differences that deserve further discussion .",
    "these are related to the stochastic elements of the dynamics used in that framework which are absent from the present one . within this approach ,",
    "these can be assimilated to the effects of a finite temperature .",
    "we turn to this point in the next section .",
    "the usual rules of the bam or the gmg involve a stochastic updating of the attendance probabilities of each customer .",
    "when the account of points of the @xmath71th player falls below zero a new value of @xmath5 is chosen _ at random _ from the interval @xmath72 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a kind of thermal fluctuation in which @xmath73 can be related to the temperature .",
    "a few qualitative features support this . in equilibrium ,",
    "the population is drastically polarized into those that consistently go to the bar ( and therefore @xmath74 ) and those that do not go ( @xmath75 ) . a small fraction having @xmath5 s with intermediate values continuously migrate between both extreme strategies .",
    "this migration causes that the value of @xmath49 fluctuates around @xmath0 .",
    "these random values of @xmath49 have a distribution that is sharply peaked at that value and has a width that is regulated by @xmath73 . in what regards the density distribution @xmath6 , a small value of @xmath73 produces sharp peaks at @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 for intermediate values . for larger values of @xmath73",
    "there is a larger fraction of players that migrate between @xmath76 and @xmath77 thus producing a rising in the  bottom \" of the distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the above qualitative arguments provide hints to introduce thermal fluctuations in the deterministic dynamics presented in the preceeding section and also about their relationship with @xmath73 for the case of the gmg .",
    "however a singular situation occurs for @xmath79 that is associated to an infinitely long relaxation process or when @xmath80 in which this parameter loses its physical meaning of a being a probability .",
    "thermal - like fluctuations can formally be introduced following the same steps as the langevin approach to describe a brownian particle.in the present situation we start with the eq .",

    "the source of noise @xmath81 can be taken to be the average of @xmath3 uncorrelated sources of random fluctuations affecting all the independent agents .",

    "we formally define a temperature parameter @xmath94 that is independent from the size of the system , as the mean square fluctuations of @xmath49 in an equilibrium configuration , scaled by the number of agents of the system .",
    "neglecting terms @xmath95 we obtain :    @xmath96    the parameter @xmath47 is a factor relating @xmath94 with the amplitude of the random fluctuations and plays a similar role than the boltzmann constant .",

    "firstly finite size effects are clearly seen to affect only the smallest systems up to @xmath118 .",
    "second the independence of @xmath117 from the size of the system as assumed in the definition of eq.([temperatura ] ) follows from the fact that the curves for @xmath119 lump tightly together . in the third place a linear regression of all the curves",
    "establishes that @xmath73 and @xmath94 have the same physical interpretations , and within the interval considered are nearly proportional to each other , namely @xmath120 , with @xmath121 .",
    "the fact that @xmath94 and @xmath73 are conceptually equivalent leads to extend the gmg simulations to higher values of @xmath73 .",
    "these values have seldom been explored @xcite in the literature because this parameter measures the _ minor _ adjustments performed by the agents that try to find the  best \" attendance probability .",
    "large values of @xmath73 could for instance correspond to irresolute or hesitating agents .",
    "there are however important points that have to be considered . in the first place the value of @xmath73",
    "can not be taken arbitrarily large .",
    "this is so because it measures the uncertainty of the value of a probability .",
    "values of @xmath122 have therefore little physical meaning .",
    "in addition , if @xmath73 is nevertheless extended to values higher than 1 by any plausible analytical extension ( for instance using periodic or reflective boundary conditions ) , the fluctuations @xmath123 for @xmath80 are seen to saturate at an approximately constant value ( see inset in fig . [",
    "t_vs_tau]@xmath116 ) .",
    "these facts cause that the correspondence between @xmath124 and @xmath94 necessarily breaks down .",
    "a comparison of the probability density distributions @xmath6 obtained with both approaches further supports this departure . in fig .",

    "[ p(p)termica]@xmath109 that are obtained with the dynamics given in eq.([termico ] ) .",

    "see for instance the distributions plotted in full line in fig.[p(p)termica](b ) and the one for @xmath126 in fig.[p(p)termica](a ) .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the origin of the departure between both dynamics can be found in the scoring of successes and failures that is used in the gmg , that is absent in the present approach .",
    "some customers can be considered to be excluded from the updating dynamics as a consequence of their great accumulation of points .",
    "this , for instance , produces the large value of @xmath127 : many players that have accumulated a large positive account attending the bar do not change strategy .",
    "the scoring of each player works as a kind of  maxwell deamon \" that classifies agents into different groups , endowing each one with a different updating rate .",
    "the equilibrium configuration that is reached in the gmg therefore entails a distribution of updating rates in which some players are essentially frozen while others modify their attendance strategies frequently .",
    "this situation is completely different to the one obtained with the dynamics of eq.([termico ] ) in which _ all _ agents undergo stochastic perturbations in _ every _ time step .    in order to show this we present in fig .",
    "[ maxwell ] some results of the gmg , in which we have used a large value of @xmath73 ( @xmath128 ) and we have arbitrarily partitioned the ensemble of 1001 players into two sets .",
    "one of the sets gathers all players having at most 10 points the other contains all the rest .",
    "we have plotted their respective density distributions @xmath6 .",
    "the agents having less that 11 points are the ones that participate more strongly in the dynamics because undergo more frequent updatings .",
    "the above comparison indicates that the gmg and the thermal relaxation dynamics of eq.([termico ] ) strictly coincide only in the limit of @xmath129 .",
    "however the strong qualitative resemblance of the results for @xmath130 allows to interpret @xmath124 , with these limitations , as equivalent to a thermal fluctuation .",
    "the thermal interpretation of @xmath73 has one interesting consequence .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the relaxation processes of the gmg performed with large @xmath73 is that the high fluctuations prevents quenching ( see fig .",
    "[ melting ] ) .",
    "this allows to provide a new framework to the annealing procedure presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite that resembles more closely the traditional protocol of ref.@xcite .",
    "the method presented in ref.@xcite requires an iterative procedure which involves a short evolution of the @xmath86 agent system and the subsequent elimination of all points accumulated in the system .",
    "this is repeated until a moment in which the distribution @xmath6 remains stationary . with the present interpretation of @xmath73 , a thermal annealing relaxation for the gmg",
    "can be performed for the cases in which @xmath0 is significantly different from 1/2 .",
    "this new protocol can be assumed to take place in episodes . in the first episode , relaxation is allowed using a value of @xmath73 that is large enough to insure that equilibrium is reached and quenching is prevented .",
    "the following episodes start from the equilibrium reached in the preceeding one , and a new relaxation process is allowed with a smaller value of @xmath73 that is still large enough to avoid the appearance of quenching .",
    "the process continues until a lower bound of @xmath73 is reached . following this  cooling \"",
    "protocol quenching never occurs , an absolute minimum of @xmath131 is obtained and the population remains strongly polarized .",
    "in the present paper we provide and alternative description of the dynamics of a system composed by many agents that play at the gmg .",
    "this is given in terms of the optimization of a single global magnitude , instead of doing it in terms independent actions of the @xmath3 agents .",
    "we do this by studying the effect of introducing a cost function @xmath31 that is associated to the second moment of the probability distribution of the size of the attending parties .",
    "we have proven that @xmath31 has the relevant properties of an internal energy . in equilibrium , it is a positive extensive quantity that scales linearly with the number of agents @xmath3 and its minima correspond to equilibrium configurations with a highly polarized population , as found in the bam or the gmg without quenching .",
    "in addition , the deterministic dynamics that is derived from the descent along the gradient of @xmath31 leads the system to configurations that have an equivalent polarization as that found with the traditional stochastic updating of the bam or the gmg .",
    "this is a non trivial equivalence between two completely different organization schemes of the n - agent system . on the one hand",
    "the gradient descent gives rise to a set of coupled differential equations that represents a coordinated evolution of all the agents as would be the result of the action of a  central planner \" of the whole system .",
    "on the other hand , within the gmg all the agents act independently from each other adjusting their attendance strategies with the purpose of optimizing their individual utilities .",
    "even though the two relaxation mechanisms are very different , the final configurations of the system turn out to have equivalent features .",
    "the definition of @xmath31 in terms of the second moment of the probability distribution of attending parties is reminiscent of the many body hamiltonian introduced in ref.@xcite to cast a version of the mg into the spin glass formalism . in the present case @xmath31",
    "can also be considered as a many body hamiltonian with one- and two - body interactions in which the @xmath3 dynamic variables are the attendance probabilities @xmath5 s , with @xmath132 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath31 and the associated relaxation process allows to define a temperature parameter through a langevin - like approach .",
    "the value of @xmath94 remains associated to the ensemble average of the square of the fluctuations of the attendance , scaled by the number of agents .",
    "its introduction in @xmath31 provides the proof that this quantity , in thermal equilibrium , scales linearly with the size @xmath3 of the system and therefore qualifies as an extensive parameter .    on the other hand , in order to be an intensive parameter , @xmath94 should be independent of the size of the system . this has been checked numerically for the case of the gmg . however finite size effects in the definition of @xmath94 become negligible only for systems that are significantly larger than the minimal ones that already display the self organization features and that have spurred the popularity of the minority game .",
    "thermal fluctuations can be included in the dynamics that corresponds to the descent along the gradient of @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding distributions @xmath6 can readily be found and a comparison can be made of @xmath94 with @xmath73 involved in the relaxation of the gmg or the bam .",
    "a direct relationship can be established between both parameters but only in the limit of @xmath79 .",
    "we have also considered the dynamics of the gmg with moderately large values of @xmath73 when still the divergence between the gmg and the thermal dynamics is not important .",
    "a stochastic updating that involves large values of @xmath73 could be thought to be associated to irresolute or badly informed agents that correct their attendance probabilities performing _ significant _ changes in each correction .",
    "the gmg relaxation for large values of @xmath73 avoids quenching even for @xmath0 significantly different from 1/2 .",
    "this fact , together with the thermal interpretation of @xmath73 allows to cast the annealing procedure presented in ref.@xcite into the more traditional framework in which @xmath94 is progressively reduced in successive epochs .",
    "cooling \" protocol could well be assimilated to a succession of _ learning episodes _ of the many agent system . in the first episodes in which agents have little  experience \" and",
    "the information about the past is scarce , all agents perform large amplitude - even random - corrections . in the last episodes of the relaxation process , as there is a richer information about the past history of the system the agents perform finer corrections , the fluctuations are smaller and the cost paid by a wrong attendance are also smaller .",
    "the fact that on the one hand an extensive magnitude can be defined playing the role of an internal energy , and that on the other , a microscopic definition of the temperature can be made , opens the way to a the full thermodynamic description of a system of n - agent performing a gmg .",
    "this amount to introduce a gibbs distribution defined as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 stands for the partition function .",
    "all thermodynamic functions should follow from this .",
    "in ref.@xcite the average of eq.([costo ] ) is defined as @xmath135 instead of @xmath31 as we do here .",
    "we prefer the present notation because , as we prove later , this quantity , in equilibrium , scales linearly with the size of the system as corresponds to an extensive quantity ."
