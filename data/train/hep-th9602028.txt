    "the work of knizhnik , polyakov and zamolodchikov ( kpz )  @xcite as well as of david , distler and kawai ( ddk )  @xcite made it possible to understand many aspects two - dimensional quantum gravity coupled to conformal field theories . at the same time",
    ", it became clear that the models of dynamical triangulations coupled to matter fields provide us with a statistical mechanical realisation of the models described by kpz and ddk , in the same way as the two - dimensional ising model at its critical point can be viewed as a conformal @xmath2 field theory .",
    "two aspects of 2d quantum gravity coupled to matter fields remain puzzling : the @xmath3 barrier and the concept of correlation length .",
    "the formulae for critical exponents derived by kpz cease to be valid for @xmath4 and the critical exponents are derived by general scaling arguments applied to globally defined operators . at no point is the concept of a divergent correlation length introduced . for ordinary statistical systems",
    "the divergence of a correlation length when a critical temperature is approached is believed to be the underlying reason that general scaling arguments work well .",
    "the difficulties of defining a local length scale in quantum gravity are well known and have so far prevented a proper treatment of correlation functions by means of continuum methods .    working entirely in the context of dynamical triangulations",
    "the problems mentioned are not seen directly .",
    "statistical models with multiple ising spins living on dynamically triangulated surfaces are perfectly well defined even if @xmath4 and they have a critical point .",
    "at least superficially , the only difference compared to @xmath5 is that we can not solve the theory . nevertheless , low temperature expansions and mean field calculations seem reliable for @xmath6 , as is confirmed by the agreement between the theoretical calculations and monte carlo simulations of the systems with large @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the picture which emerges for large @xmath7 from the low temperature expansion  @xcite is as follows : for large @xmath8 ( low temperature ) there is a magnetized phase for which @xmath9 separated from a branched polymer phase , where @xmath10 , by a transition at a critical @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "likewise it has been possible by the use of dynamical triangulations to address the question of correlation length in two - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "a two - point correlator between `` punctures '' has been calculated in pure gravity as a function of a `` quantum '' geodesic distance and it is found that standard scaling relations , known from the theory of critical phenomena , are satisfied , although with unusual critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "so far it has not been possible in 2d quantum gravity to calculate correlation functions of matter fields as a function of the geodesic distance .",
    "the attempts to measure the spin - spin correlation functions by monte carlo simulations and to define a divergent correlation length as one approaches the critical point , have so far been ambiguous  @xcite .",
    "the question arises as to whether there is a divergent spin - spin correlation length associated with the phase transition between a magnetized and a non - magnetized phase in the two - dimensional ising model coupled to gravity . rather surprisingly from a continuum point of view ,",
    "we can , using dynamical triangulations , begin to answer this question in the limit of large @xmath7 , i.e. in the limit where a large number of ising models is coupled to quantum gravity .",
    "the statistical model we will define and solve in the following sections is a toy model of 2d quantum gravity coupled to ising spins in the sense that the correct summation over all triangulations is performed , but not all the spin configurations are included .",
    "the spin configurations we include are precisely the ones which dominate in the large @xmath7 limit , at large @xmath8 , namely those for which the domains are connected in a tree - like fashion with domain boundaries of minimal size .",
    "this model allows us to calculate the two - point functions ( using a certain definition of distance , which is based on the geodesic distance ) and extract the critical exponents .",
    "we will verify that these exponents satisfy standard scaling relations and that the geometrical interpretation of some of the exponents is related to the fractal structure of the underlying `` space - time '' , in agreement with general arguments ; that is , we explicitly verify that the exponent @xmath13 is related to the hausdorff dimension by @xmath14 .",
    "the model has a third order transition between a tree - like ( i.e.  branched polymer ) phase and a magnetized phase .",
    "it is found that there is a diverging correlation length in the tree phase associated with the geometric two - point function , but no diverging correlation length associated with the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "next we turn our attention to the full model of @xmath0 independent ising spins coupled to 2d gravity , which has a central charge of @xmath15 . following the analysis of the toy model ,",
    "we show that various two - point functions decay exponentially with distance in the magnetized phase .",
    "again there is a diverging correlation length associated with the geometric two - point function . by assuming that all the standard scaling relations still hold for this model and making a few further fairly modest assumptions",
    ", we show that the critical exponents for the transition between the magnetized and branched polymer phases , in the full model , are the same as those in the toy model .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : toynomag ] we define the toy model , define a variant of geodesic distance in the model and calculate the two - point function . in sections  [ sec :",
    "toycrit ] and  [ sec : dh ] the critical exponents and hausdorff dimension are calculated for the toy model , whilst section [ sec : spinspin ] discusses the spin - spin correlation function . in section",
    "[ sec : toymag ] we verify by direct calculation in an external magnetic field , that the magnetic exponents found by scaling arguments are indeed the correct ones . in section [ sec : full ] we address some of the questions mentioned above for the full model , i.e.  in the model where we sum over all the spin configurations .",
    "finally , section [ sec : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "before looking at the full model of @xmath0 spins coupled to 2d gravity ( in the form of a sum over planar 3 graphs ) , we will solve a toy model , which is very similar to the one studied in  @xcite .",
    "as for that model we will show that there is a magnetized phase for which @xmath16 and a branched polymer phase with @xmath17 .",
    "on the boundary @xmath18 , which is the same value as that in  @xcite and agrees with the result @xmath19 for @xmath20 , the pure gravity value , which one might expect from the calculation in  @xcite .    for our model",
    "we sum over all possible rooted planar 3 graphs ( let us denote this set of graphs by @xmath21 ) , but we only sum over a subset of the possible spin configurations , namely those for which the domains are connected in a tree - like fashion , with at most one link connecting any two domains . in this paper",
    "we shall only consider planar graphs , that is , @xmath22 throughout .",
    "each vertex will be weighted with a factor of @xmath23 and has @xmath0 independent spins on it which can take the values @xmath24 ( i.e.  vertex @xmath25 has spins @xmath26 on it , with @xmath27 ) .",
    "links joining vertices with dissimilar spin configurations will be given a factor of @xmath28 for each spin flavour which differs .",
    "thus the grand canonical partition function , t , is [ eqn : gcpf ] t = _ g x^n _ \\{s} _",
    "< i j > ( _ = 1^p ( \\{s_i^s_j^-1 ) ) , where the first summation is over graphs , with @xmath29 being the number of vertices in the graph .",
    "the product is over the nearest neighbour pairs on the graph @xmath30 ( referred to as `` links '' ) and the second summation is over the following set of spin configurations .",
    "take the graph @xmath30 and decompose it into a set of one - particle irreducible ( `` 1pi '' ) graphs ( which we shall call `` blobs '' ) connected in a tree - like fashion ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tree ] ) ; note that these blobs are essentially just minimum necked baby universes ( `` minbu ' 's ) .",
    "the blobs are fully magnetized , that is , all the vertices within a 1pi blob have the same set of spins , and we will sum over the @xmath31 possible spin configurations for each blob ( except the root blob for which all the spins will be fixed to be @xmath32 ) .",
    "( 100,55)(0,0 )    in the next sections we will solve this model exactly and also calculate various correlation functions , but in order to do this we need first to define how distances are to be measured on the graphs .",
    "one possible measure of the distance between two vertices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , is the geodesic distance between them .",
    "that is , find the shortest path from @xmath33 to @xmath34 along links , counting a distance of one unit for every link traversed  this gives the geodesic distance between the two points .",
    "unfortunately , this is quite difficult to deal with analytically , although some results are known for the pure gravity case  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use a slightly different definition of distance , which is much simpler to handle .",
    "the distance between two vertices will be defined as the shortest path between them along links , counting a distance of one unit only for links that separate two 1pi blobs .",
    "since we are interested in correlations between the spins in the root blob , which are held fixed and spins further away , distances will be measured from the root blob .",
    "thus all the vertices in the root blob have a distance zero , all the vertices within blobs connected by a single link to the root blob are at distance one and so on ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tree ] ) . it will turn out that the average number of vertices in each blob is very small , so that for many graphs this definition of distance will be quite similar to the geodesic distance , especially in the branched polymer phase for which the partition function is dominated by tree - like graphs .",
    "the advantage of measuring distances in this way is that it makes it very easy to define a transfer function , @xmath35 , [ eqn : f ] f(y)=  ( x ( 1- y)^- ) + y^2 , where @xmath36 and ( x ) = _ g x^n .",
    "this summation is over the set @xmath37 of rooted planar 1pi graphs .",
    "this function , @xmath35 , takes a rooted 1pi blob and glues an arbitrary number of trees , each weighted with a factor of @xmath38 , on to the blob .",
    "note that each time we glue a tree on to a link in the blob , we pick up a factor of @xmath23 , for the new vertex that is created , a factor of two because we can hang the tree in one of two directions and a factor of @xmath39 to take account of the @xmath31 different ways the spins on the blob and those on the tree s root blob can differ  this accounts for the factor of @xmath40 multiplying each @xmath38 .",
    "when we sum over all possible rooted 1pi blobs and all possible ways of gluing trees to links this gives the first term in ( [ eqn : f ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the blob without any trees attached has a weight of @xmath41 .",
    "consider a rooted graph with @xmath29 vertices , it has @xmath42 internal links and we can add an arbitrary number of trees to each link , giving a total contribution of @xmath43 for the graph .",
    "when we sum over all 1pi graphs this gives a contribution of _",
    "g x^n ( 1- y)^-l =   ( x ( 1- y)^- ) .",
    "the second term in ( [ eqn : f ] ) comes from the special case in which the root blob only consists of a single vertex , in which case we get a factor of @xmath23 for the vertex , @xmath44 for the possible ways the spins may differ and @xmath45 for the two trees .",
    "( 100,25)(0,0 )    the partition function , @xmath46 , satisfies @xmath47 and this is represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : tft ] ; the shaded circle represents the sum over 1pi graphs , @xmath41 . for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath8 ,",
    "this equation gives @xmath46 as a function of @xmath23 . by finding the closest singularity to the origin , which occurs at @xmath48 , say",
    ", we can determine the free energy for the model .",
    "for what follows it will be convenient to define @xmath49 .",
    "now , there are essentially two different types of singularity .",
    "one occurs when @xmath50 equals @xmath51 , the critical value of @xmath50 for @xmath52 and this will correspond to the magnetized phase .",
    "the other occurs when the graphs become tree - like and we shall come back to this case later .",
    "consider the first case , for which @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 , then writing @xmath56 as @xmath57 , t_c =  _ c + t_c^2 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "defining , h ( ) ^=  , we get [ eqn : quadhh ] 1- h^2 = ( 1 + e^-2 ) ^p .",
    "however , @xmath41 is a known function , from brzin _ et al _ @xcite one can show that [ eqn : model2z ] ( x)= ( 1 - 3 ) , where @xmath60 .",
    "this gives @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "hence we can solve ( [ eqn : quadhh ] ) to get @xmath64 with [ eqn : xcmag ] h^2 = , where we have defined @xmath65 .",
    "this gives @xmath53 in the magnetized phase",
    " we shall prove that it is magnetized later .",
    "next we will calculate @xmath67 , the average number of 1pi blobs at distance @xmath68 . define @xmath69 , where the notation means @xmath70 ; this weights each blob at distance @xmath68 with an extra factor of @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 can be regarded as the standard partition function , but with the root blob weighted by an extra factor of @xmath71 . applying the function @xmath73 to this",

    "in the tree - like region and on the boundary , @xmath92 , hence @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",

    "the calculations in this section only apply for non - negative integer @xmath0 and it is not entirely clear whether @xmath372 , the value of @xmath0 at point @xmath352 , is an integer .",
    "it is tempting to suppose that @xmath373 , in which case one could understand the breakdown of the kpz formula in terms of the appearance of the branched polymer phase , however monte carlo simulations do not seem to support this hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "in this article we have studied correlation functions in two - dimensional quantum gravity coupled to ising spins . for the toy model two approximations",
    "are used : ( i ) the spin configurations allowed are the ones dominant in the low temperature expansion of multiple ising spins on dynamically triangulated surfaces and ( ii ) the distance between two spins is identified with the number of links separating 1pi subgraphs along a path connecting the spins . in the full model only the second approximation is made .",
    "we do not expect this last approximation to be important for values of @xmath8 where @xmath374 , i.e.  for values of @xmath8 where the average number of vertices of a generic @xmath1 graph diverges for @xmath375 , since the average number of vertices in an 1pi part of a generic @xmath1 graph in our ensemble is very small .",
    "however , if @xmath376 the average number of vertices in a generic @xmath1 graph is itself small , even at the critical point @xmath377 and our definition of distance can not be used to extract in a reliable way the fractal properties of the ensemble of @xmath1 graphs . approximation ( i ) has been shown to be exact in the @xmath378 limit  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite suggest that it is an excellent approximation except for the smallest values of @xmath8 if many ising spins are coupled to two - dimensional gravity . for moderate values of @xmath7",
    "it is difficult to judge if approximation ( i ) is reliable all the way down to @xmath11 . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i )",
    "not a good approximation for @xmath379 $ ] .",
    "the toy model allows us to analyze the two - point function ( the puncture - puncture correlator ) and the spin - spin correlator as a function of the distance @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath380 we have @xmath381 and the fractal structure is reliably extracted from the two - point function .",
    "we find that @xmath382 for @xmath383 , while it jumps to @xmath162 at @xmath11 .",
    "whilst we can not calculate @xmath152 for @xmath384 , one might expect it to equal four , the pure gravity value  @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath152 is different from 4 for @xmath380 is an indication of the very strong interaction between gravity and matter for @xmath385 .",
    "a further indication of the strong link between geometry and matter configurations present in the model is found in the scaling relations for the magnetic exponents .",
    "they are found from the behaviour of the _ two - point function _ @xmath386 in the region @xmath387 .",
    "the exponential decay of @xmath386 _ at _ @xmath388 as a function of the distance @xmath68 defines a length scale ( ) ~ , which diverges for @xmath139 and allows us to define the magnetic exponents using the standard hyper - scaling relations ( note that @xmath389 for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the same exponents are found , for the toy model , by a direct calculation in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "strictly speaking , it seems more natural to define magnetic scaling properties from one of the spin - spin correlators , i.e.  either @xmath390 or @xmath192 , however the corresponding correlation length does not diverge at @xmath11 .",
    "this is an indication of the geometric nature of the transition .    for the full model",
    ", a summation over all spin configurations is performed and the only approximation made is in the measure of distance that is used . as before there is an exponential decay of both the two - point function and the spin - spin correlation function , and one can define , in the magnetized phase , a geometric correlation length , which diverges as the tree phase is approached .",
    "based on the analysis in section  [ sec : fullspin ] we do not expect the spin - spin correlation length , at least as we have defined it , to diverge at the magnetized to tree - like transition . using the geometric length scale and",
    "the scaling relations , which have been shown to hold for the toy model , all the critical exponents are calculated for the branched polymer phase and its boundary , on the basis of a small number of assumptions .",
    "the exponents are the same as those for the toy model ( see table  [ tab : exp ] ) and again @xmath137 within the tree phase and @xmath152 is equal to three on the critical line , showing the strong interaction between the matter fields and the geometry .    some interesting questions remain to be answered , such as what happens outside the branched polymer phase , in particular what the values of the geometric exponents and @xmath152 are , and whether there is a diverging length associated with the spin - spin correlation function at the magnetization transition ( between the u and m phases ) .",
    "unfortunately our measure of distance is inadequate in this region and it will require further work using probably the full geodesic distance in order to determine this",
    ". it would also be useful to locate point @xmath352 on the phase diagram , as it has been suggested  @xcite that @xmath391 , in which case there is an intermediate region , for @xmath392 , between the kpz regime and the branched polymer phase ."
