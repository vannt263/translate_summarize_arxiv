    "blazars are a sub - class of active galactic nuclei , emitting from radio to tev energies .",
    "they are subdivided in two main categories : flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects .",
    "fsrqs are characterized by a flat radio spectrum in the ghz range ( with spectral index @xmath1 , where the flux density is @xmath2 ) , and strong and broad emission lines ( with equivalent width @xmath35 @xmath4 ) .",
    "bl lac objects , on the other hand , have no or weak emission lines with equivalent width @xmath55 @xmath4 .",
    "+ blazars continuum emission originates from a relativistic jet aligned with the line of sight .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shows a double humped shape @xcite , with a low energy peak lying between ir and x - rays , and an high energy peak in the mev - tev band .",
    "+ the low energy region of blazar spectra is associated with the synchrotron emission coming from the jet relativistic electrons .",
    "the high energy region can be modeled through inverse compton emission ( leptonic models ) , with seed photons coming from an external region ( e.g. the accretion disk , the dusty torus ) , eventually reprocessed by the broad line region , or the hot corona , or from the synchrotron process itself ( synchrotron self - compton , or ssc ) .",
    "a detailed description of leptonic models can be found in @xcite .",
    "the high energy region can also be modeled with hadronic scenarios @xcite , where the very high energy protons of the jet are radiatively important . the accelerated protons produce gamma ray emission through proton synchrotron emission , the decay of neutral pions , and synchrotron emission produced by secondaries . + the location of the so - called `` blazar - zone '' , i.e. , the spatial location of the blazar sed - peaks and gamma - ray emitting region , in blazars is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite proposed that the blazar - zone is located at 39 pc from the central engine for the outburst of 3c  454.3 ( a bright fsrq ) occurred in 2005 .",
    "for the same flare , @xcite indicated , instead , a dissipation region at 0.50.8 pc from the central black hole ( bh ) . from the combined study of time - dependent polarimetric radio images at 43 and 86 ghz , the optical polarimetry , and radio , optical , x-",
    ", gamma - ray light curves , @xcite proposed that the low and high energy emission is located near the 43 ghz core , at a distance of the order of tens of parsecs from the bh for 3c  454.3 .",
    "a similar investigation , performed for the bl lac objects oj287 and ao  0235 + 164 @xcite , led to similar results .",
    "+ @xcite established that gamma - rays emitted inside the broad line region ( blr ) are absorbed at e@xmath6 @xmath7 due to the @xmath8 interaction with the blr photons ( internal absorption ) .",
    "@xcite refined this result , and claimed internal absorption features at e@xmath9 @xmath10/(1+z ) and at e@xmath6 @xmath7 in the gamma - ray spectrum of 3c  279 , 3c  454.3 , pks  1510 - 08 , and a few other fsrq . + within the leptonic scenario , @xcite show that the contribution of external photon fields , including contributions from the blr and dusty torus to the inverse compton emission can be parametrized as a function of the accretion disk luminosity and the dissipation distance of the emitting blob from the bh @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the sed of the gamma - ray loudest blazars as being emitted at 0.010.5 pc from the bh . + using multiwavelength observations of the blazar , we will apply the models of @xcite to further investigate the location of the blazar - zone .",

    "the _ agile_grid gamma - ray telescope ( operating in the 30 mev  50 gev energy range , see @xcite ) performed two observing campaigns of the virgo field .",
    "the first campaign included 3 observations from 2007 december 16 to 2008 january 8 .",
    "there were 3 simultaneous observations ( revolutions 633 , 635 , 637 ) with the wide - field instruments aboard the _ integral _ mission ( operating in optical , hard x- , and soft gamma - rays , see @xcite ) . during this campaign",

    "we performed the f  test on the two fits reported in table [ tab : sfit ] to test the hypothesis of the need of the absorption components .",
    "the f  test gives a value of 0.15 , and an associated probability of @xmath087% , hence the absorption component is not necessary to fit the spectrum , suggesting that in  the blazar zone is located in the outer low - ionization region of the blr or outside it .",
    "we constructed two spectral energy distributions referring to the high gamma - ray activity observed by _",
    "agile _ and _ fermi _ ( campaigns a and b , respectively , as reported in table [ tab : obs ] ) with the data collected so far .",
    "the _ agile _ data are integrated for 4 days ( the duration of the last observation during the campaign a , from 2008 january 4 13:35 to 2008 january 8 11:06 ut ) .",
    "fermi_lat data for period b are integrated within 4 days around the flux peak ( 2008 december 29 16:00 ut ) to achieve acceptable statistics .",

    "+    c +    c    the sed modeling has been performed in the framework of leptonic models .",
    "we assume that the emitting region is a spherical blob of radius @xmath11 , with bulk lorentz factor @xmath12 , an electron population distribution proportional to @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the lorentz factor of the electrons , ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ) , and a randomly oriented magnetic field @xmath17 filling the dissipation region . the observer line of sight and the jet direction form an angle @xmath18 .",
    "we parametrize the external radiation fields as proposed by @xcite , where the key elements are the accretion disk luminosity and the distance ( @xmath19 ) of the emitting blob from the central bh .",
    "we consider a jet aperture @xmath20=0.1 , according to @xcite . in evaluating the power carried by protons ,",
    "we assume one proton per emitting electron .",
    "we assumed that during the campaigns a and b , the accretion disk luminosity is the same as the one obtained from the sdss data in 2001 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_multiepochs ] ) .",
    "we found in section 5.4 that the _ fermi_lat gamma - ray spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_multiepochs ] green data , one month integration ) does not show absorption from the blr .",
    "therefore , we tried to find solutions for the blob dissipating beyond the blr , without taking into account the gamma - gamma absorption from the blr .",
    "we obtained two possible solutions for the modeling .",
    "model parameters are reported in table [ tab : models ] , where we use @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the refer to the distance of the blr region ( of the dusty torus ) from the bh ; f@xmath23 ( f@xmath24 ) to the fraction of the disk emission that is reprocessed by the blr in lines ( by the dusty torus ) ; @xmath25 to the accretion efficiency ; @xmath26 to the electron lorentz factor for which the electron energy halves in the blob crossing time ( @xmath11/_c _ ) . + the first solution ( model 1 , top panel of figure [ fig : sed_multiepochs ] ) places the dissipation region ( r@xmath27 ) just beyond the blr ( r@xmath280.2 pc from the smbh ) , where the photon field from the dusty torus is almost equal to the blr seed photon field . at such a distance , the variability time - scale of a blob of radius r@xmath297@xmath30 cm is of the order @xmath03 days , qualitatively in agreement ( within a factor 2 ) with the 1-day binned gamma - ray light curve of the source . according to this modeling of the seed photon fields , the blr photon contribution is expected to fade over time while the torus contribution remains constant .",
    "both ssc and external compton ( ec ) with seed photons from the torus contribute to the soft x - ray emission , the hard x - ray is dominated by ec emission with seed photons from the torus , and the gev emission is dominated by ec with seed photons from the blr . in the mev",
    "up to gev range the two ec contributions are almost equal",
    ". further investigation of the variability is not possible , as no optical light - curve is available from which to trace the electron population from the synchrotron emission .",
    "moreover the evolution of the gamma - ray photon index with time ( reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) is statistically poor .",
    "+ the second solution to the sed modeling ( model 2 ) has been found by assuming r@xmath287 pc from the smbh .",
    "such a model requires a r@xmath31 = @xmath32 cm , with a variability time - scale of the order of @xmath010@xmath33  days .",
    "we do not find such a variability time - scale in the gamma - ray light curve , but we observe that the activity period for the source lasts at least 11 weeks .",
    "we can argue that the dissipating region in the jet has a radius of @xmath32 cm .",
    "gradients of the electron energy density in the distance from the black hole , or disturbances in the jet ( see for examples @xcite ) can be responsible for the shorter variability observed in gamma - rays . with this model , the x - ray emission is due to ssc ; the gamma - ray emission is due to ec with seed photons from the torus .",
    "the direct contribution of accretion disk photons to the ec is negligible .",
    "+ in the model for a blob dissipating just beyond the blr , the energy region below @xmath010@xmath34hz is self absorbed .",
    "on the contrary , in the model of a distant dissipation region , there is no self - absorption , thus allowing the direct observation of radio emission from the blob . in this case , the emission predicted by the model is slightly higher than the flux reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_multiepochs ] ( bottom panel ) , but we note that no radio observations were performed during the gamma - ray flares . the mismatch in the variability time - scale for model 2 with r@xmath287 pc , results from the assumption that r@xmath31=@xmath35r@xmath27 .",
    "alternatively , we tried to model the sed assuming a blob of radius @xmath36 cm to satisfy the observed variability time - scale , and dissipating at @xmath05 pc from the smbh ( model 3 ) .",

    "[ fig : sed_multiepochs2 ] . +",
    "a similar kind of solution has been suggested by @xcite to explain faster variability ( of the order of 10 min ) for pks 1222 + 216 .",

    "granted , we can not fully exclude the possibility that the archival sdss and galex observations we have reported could be interpreted as other emission mechanisms than thermal disk emission because we lack strictly simultaneous radio observations and extended radio light curves to corroborate the assumption of low jet emission .",

    "we made an estimate of the smbh mass of  and the accretion rate from a period of low jet activity . with these estimates , we were able to study the december 2008 flare . modeling the observed flat gamma - ray spectrum and sed also allowed for an investigation into the location of the blazar - zone of the object . + as a final remark , it is worth stressing two major points .",
    "first , by definition , our estimate of r@xmath27 is model dependent .",
    "the location of the dissipation region was estimated assuming the parametrization proposed by @xcite for the blr and the torus contribution to seed photons for the ec . according to this parametrization , it was possible to derive r@xmath27 from the luminosity ratio of synchrotron to ec emission .",
    "in fact , in the parametrization by @xcite for a dissipation region outside the blr , the seed photons for ec fade with distance from the smbh .",
    "we obtained two solutions .",
    "referring to figure  2 of @xcite , the ratio @xmath62 equals the ratio of the optical to gamma - rays luminosity at the two values of the r@xmath27 ( assuming knowledge of the magnetic energy density ) .",
    "for the flares of  reported in this article , one solution ( model 2 ) places the blob at r@xmath287 pc , with only the dusty torus as the origin of seed photons . the other solution ( model 1 , with r@xmath280.2 pc )",
    "corresponds to just outside the blr , where the contribution of seed photons from both the dusty torus and the blr are relevant .",
    "the magnetic field is constrained in the sed modeling by the cutoff of synchrotron emission in the uv ( due to the last and most energetic electrons ) , and by the corresponding cutoff of ec which we can not derive directly from data ( that give non - constraining upper limits at e@xmath320 gev , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed_multiepochs ] ) .",
    "assuming the thomson regime , and with only one external photon field contributing to the ec , the ratio _",
    "f_@xmath63 between the synchrotron cutoff energy and the ec cutoff energy is proportional to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the typical seed photon field energy .",
    "hence if we have constraining data at the highest energy , and with a specific geometry in the model , we can constrain b/@xmath12 . however",
    ", the geometry in the model also constrains @xmath66 , hence in the ideal case we can obtain b/@xmath12 and r@xmath27 from the sed modeling .",
    "the ratio of synchrotron to ssc luminosity further constrains the model parameters @xmath67 , allowing one to remove the degeneracy between @xmath12 and b. in reality , we can obtain only upper limits of _ f_@xmath63 because the data at higher energies are non - constraining .",
    "so we have only upper limits on @xmath68 for each model . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath66 could be lower than in our parametrization ( we have to maintain the ratio @xmath69 at the desired value ) .",
    "this implies that r@xmath27 could be higher than our evaluations .",
    "+ the second point is that the photon field intensity is proportional to the accretion disk luminosity , and the blr and torus location is proportional to @xmath70 . in all our estimations",
    ", we assume that the disk luminosity is almost steady over time , e.g. , in the low state observed during the sloan survey in 2002 , during the galex observation in 2007 , and during the gamma - ray flares observed by _",
    "agile _ at the beginning of 2008 and by _ fermi_lat at the end of 2008 .",
    "this assumption could be false . in this case , we observe that the parametrization of @xmath71 and @xmath72 reported in equation ( 20 ) by @xcite remains unchanged while varying l@xmath43 , provided that we scale the solution for @xmath19 with @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , variations of the disk luminosity in time , and/or systematic errors in the evaluation of disk luminosity from our sdss+galex data ( possibly biased by jet emission ) only slightly affect our estimation of @xmath19 .",
    "+ the starting point of our modeling is that the emission region is far from the smbh ( at parsec scale ) , and we motivate this choice with the flat gamma - ray spectrum up to energies of 15 gev . for a different approach and results for other blazars , we refer readers to the work of @xcite .",
    "they performed a detailed study of the localization of the emission region for bright blazars making use of the variability timescale for objects showing a spectral cut - off at ( 1020)/(1+z ) gev .",
    "they obtained that the variability timescale and spectra are in agreement with a dissipation region inside the blr .",
    "+ we note that , contrary to the model we used , some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) model the seds of both fsrq and bl lacs with pure synchrotron + synchrotron self compton components only .",
    "+ model 1 ( @xmath74 0.2 pc ) , gives a variability time scale of the order of 3 days , in agreement with the flare duration estimated from the 1-day binned gamma - ray light curve .",
    "this model , however , does not properly reproduce the flat gamma - ray spectrum . in particular , in order to reproduce the observed flux at energies @xmath3 10 gev , it overestimates the spectrum for lower energies . on the contrary , model 2 ( @xmath747 pc ) reproduces the flat - gamma - ray spectrum , but it is not clear whether the predicted variability of the order of @xmath0100 days can be associated with the duration of the gamma - ray activity period estimated from the 1-week/1-month binned gamma - ray light curves",
    ". the third model has been built by relaxing the relation @xmath11=0.1@xmath19 in order to preserve the variability time - scale estimated from the 1-day gamma - ray light curve ( we follow the solution proposed by @xcite for pks  1222 + 216 ) , and it still reproduces the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "interestingly , the size of the emitting region for pks 1222 + 216 ( @xmath75 cm ) and for   differ significantly . + for the third model , we obtain @xmath11=0.0067@xmath19 , in agreement within a factor of two with the prediction of @xcite , that gives @xmath76 , for the case of efficient conversion of bulk luminosity in radiation in the strong focusing scenario . with the same assumptions ,",
    "@xcite assume that the location of the emitting region is at @xmath742.5 @xmath77erg s@xmath78 pc@xmath79 pc from the smbh , where @xmath80 is the jet power .",
    "if we invert this relation , and we make use of our result ( @xmath81 pc ) , we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "we must assume that the proton  to  emitting electron ratio is of the order of 0.1 in order to reproduce such a power ( in the evaluation of proton power reported in table [ tab : models ] we assumed one proton per emitting electron , instead ) .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite evaluated that efficient radiative conversion could be assumed if the product of the bulk lorentz factor by the opening angle is @xmath833 , and according to our third model this product is 2 .",

    "<S> in 2008 _ agile _ and _ fermi _ detected gamma - ray flaring activity from the unidentified egret source , recently associated with a flat spectrum radio quasar ( ) at z=1.762 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical counterpart of the gamma - ray source underwent a flux enhancement of a factor 15 - 30 in 6 years , and of @xmath010 in six months . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this flare - up in terms of a transition from an accretion - disk dominated emission to a synchrotron - jet dominated one . </S>",
    "<S> + we analysed a sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archival optical spectrum taken during a period of low radio and optical activity of the source . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated the mass of the central black hole using the width of the civ emission line . in our work , we have also investigated sdss archival optical photometric data and uv galex observations to estimate the thermal - disk emission contribution of . </S>",
    "<S> + our analysis of the gamma - ray data taken during the flaring episodes indicates a flat gamma - ray spectrum , with an extension of up to 15 gev , with no statistically - relevant sign of absorption from the broad line region , suggesting that the blazar - zone is located beyond the broad line region . this result </S>",
    "<S> is confirmed by the modeling of the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( well constrained by the available multiwavelength data ) of the flaring activity periods and by the accretion disk luminosity and black hole mass estimated by us using archival data .    </S>",
