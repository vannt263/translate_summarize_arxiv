    "there has been a growing interest in photonic crystals , i. e. , structures with a periodically modulated dielectric constant .",
    "the latter open new ways of manipulating electromagnetic wave emission and propagation processes @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a common belief that , in the near future , photonic crystals systems will allow us to perform many functions with light that ordinary crystals do with electrons @xcite .",
    "they also promise to become a laboratory for testing fundamental processes involving interactions of radiation with matter under novel conditions .    the basic principle behind all that is an analogy to an electron moving in a periodic potential which suggests that certain photon frequencies in a photonic crystal can also become forbidden , independent of photon polarization and the direction of propagation - a complete photonic bandgap ( cpbg ) .",
    "however , unlike in an ideal single - electron picture , a photon always faces the possibility of being absorbed and it is , _ a priori _ not clear if theoretical proposals for manufacturing a cpbg and which are obtained in the absence of absorption @xcite can ever be realized experimentally .",
    "naively , one expects that moderate absorption will only cause a slight perturbation of the band structure as confirmed in ref .",
    "therefore , the neglect of absorption in band structure calculations seem to be justified for purely dielectric photonic structures @xcite . unfortunately , such structures exhibit only a limited dielectric contrast which is insufficient to open a cpbg below infrared wavelengths @xcite . a recent proposal @xcite to obtain such a cpbg involves metallo - dielectric structures .",
    "since metals are usually rather absorbing , this again raises the question about the effect of absorption on band structure .",
    "here we mention in passing that systems with gain , i.e. , where the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath1 has the opposite sign , are important for understanding laser action in new types of lasers involving photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "although the study of absorption in photonic structures is of utmost importance , so far no rigorous results exist about fundamental matters such as the meaning of band structure and band gaps for absorptive systems . only recently",
    ", using analytic continuation techniques , it has been shown that absorption turns bands into resonances in the lower - half complex plane @xcite .",
    "literature on absorption in photonic crystals is rather sparse and , except for a recent article by yannopapas , modinos , and stefanou @xcite , only covers the cases of small absorption @xcite and small filling fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the absorptive component @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate numerically the effect of considerable absorption on the band structure of photonic crystals , we started with studying a one - dimensional model consisting of a periodically layered ( or stratified ) medium , described by the dielectric function @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the lattice constant , i.e. , the length of the primitive cell , @xmath5 is an integer , and @xmath6 .",
    "propagation of light at normal incidence in such a stratified medium is described by the one - dimensional periodic helmholtz equation @xmath7\\,\\psi({\\bf x})=0 , \\label{1dhe}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the laplacian , @xmath9 the angular frequency , @xmath10 the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath11 an eigenfunction to be calculated .",
    "another physical situation to which the one - dimensional periodic helmholtz equation applies ( [ 1dhe ] ) are grating - like structures @xcite , the so called one - dimensional ( 1d ) photonic crystals @xcite , and a number of different physical situations involving propagation of acoustic and elastic waves @xcite .",
    "below a scatterer will be a region with @xmath12 neighboured by regions with @xmath13 . for notational simplicity we also set @xmath14 .",
    "in the absence of absorption , the dispersion relation and the band structure are determined by the kkr equation , which in one dimension is identical to the kronig - penney equation @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the bloch momentum and @xmath17 is a phase shift @xcite .",
    "the latter is determined by relations @xmath18 ,   \\nonumber   \\\\ \\sin\\eta_0 & = & c_0\\left[-\\sin \\sigma r_s\\cos\\rho r_s +                     p \\,\\cos\\sigma r_s",
    "\\sin\\rho r_s \\right ] ,    \\nonumber \\\\ \\cos\\eta_1 & = & c_1\\left[\\sin \\sigma r_s\\sin\\rho r_s +                       p \\,\\cos\\sigma r_s",
    "\\cos\\rho r_s \\right ] ,    \\nonumber \\\\ \\sin\\eta_1 & = & c_1\\left[\\cos \\sigma r_s\\sin\\rho r_s -                      p\\,\\sin\\sigma r_s \\cos\\rho r_s \\right ] ,    \\nonumber \\\\ c_l & = & \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{cc } \\left[1 + ( p^2 - 1)\\,\\sin^2\\rho r_s\\right]^{-1/2 } , & l=0,\\\\ \\left [ 1 + ( p^2 - 1)\\,\\cos^2\\rho r_s\\right]^{-1/2 } , & l=1 , \\end{array}\\right .   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xcite .    equation ( [ kkreq ] ) still holds for absorbing scatterers but the ( frequency - dependent ) phase shifts @xmath17 are now complex . consequently , @xmath22 is complex and eq .",
    "( [ kkreq ] ) has no real eigenvalues . in accordance with @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvalues turn into resonances in the lower complex half - plane",
    ".    some characteristic features of the complex bands of resonances can already be seen in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath23 ) , when eq .",
    "( [ kkreq ] ) reduces to @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the _ effective dielectric constant_. if we denote by @xmath26 the absorptive material filling fraction , then @xmath27 i.e. , @xmath25 is nothing but the volume averaged dielectric constant . in the long - wavelength limit",
    ", the first complex band contains an angle @xmath28 with the real positive axis which is determined by the relation @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 , @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 one",
    "has @xmath35 down to such @xmath26 that @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this range of @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath28 exhibits only a very weak dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "surprisingly enough , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , exact numerical calculations demonstrate that the angle @xmath38 remains very close to its value established in the long - wavelength limit often till the upper edge of the second complex band of resonances .",
    "we determined the resonances numerically for an ensemble of 1d systems with i m @xmath39 varied between @xmath40 and @xmath41 for fixed @xmath42 and re @xmath43 .",
    "we investigated how absorption alters the relative gap width @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the gap width and midgap frequency of the real part of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the following lessons can be learned from an investigation of the first few bands of complex resonances for a representative sample of such 1d absorptive systems :    1 .",
    "if ( i m @xmath39)/(re @xmath47 , the effect of absorption on the band gap is negligible ( both in shifting the gap edges and in changing gap width ) ( see figs . 2 and 3 ) 2 .",
    "re @xmath48 remains a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) function of the bloch momentum for an odd ( even ) band ( when labelled from the lowest one ) 3 .",
    "absorption pushes band edges down ( see fig .",
    "2 ) 4 .   if i m @xmath39 increases , the corresponding @xmath49 tend to saturate rapidly beyond i m @xmath50 re @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "the dependence of the relative gap width @xmath49 on i m @xmath39 is monotonic up to i m @xmath51 re @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "absorption mostly increases the relative gap width @xmath49 , although in some rare cases it can also lead to a decrease of @xmath49 7 .",
    "the largest effect was an increase of the @xmath49 by @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and closing of the 2nd gap which , however , reappeared again as i m @xmath39 increased sufficiently enough 8 .   even if the absorptive material filling fraction @xmath26 within the unit cell",
    "is @xmath52 and i m @xmath39 is comparable to re @xmath39 , the imaginary part of the bloch frequency eigenvalues is @xmath53 .",
    "actually , it has been quite surprising to find out that the imaginary part of the frequency eigenvalues can increase when the absorptive material filling fraction within the unit cell is lowered !    it is noteworthy to say that a band gap in re @xmath9 does not necessarily imply a very high reflectivity .",
    "a study of finite layered structures reveals that in the presence of a strong absorption the reflectivity at the gap center can , for instance , saturate at @xmath54 or less , depending on a single bilayer absorption .",
    "the latter yields a lower bound on the absorption of a composite structure .",
    "the reflectivity at the gap center is usually more than twice that for frequencies within a band , almost exclusively as a result of decreased absorption within the gap which approaches that of a single bilayer . in both cases transmissions",
    "are small .",
    "if @xmath55 denotes the transmission for frequencies within a band , then the transmission within a gap is typically @xmath56 .",
    "a typical system to which our calculation should apply is a polymer - semiconductor or polymer - insulator layered structure where the polymer absorption dominates .",
    "our model calculations can also apply to a semiconductor - semiconductor or semiconductor - insulator heterostructure in which one component is doped by an increasing amount of an absorptive dye .",
    "our choice of @xmath39 can also be regarded as that of a metal , or an artificial metal @xcite , for frequencies above the plasma wavelength .",
    "to our best knowledge , our work is the first one to deal with the case of the photonic band structure in the presence of a strong absorption , when both @xmath57 and @xmath26 are large ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . such a study of strong absorption in photonic structures is of utmost importance , both for understanding the behaviour of recently proposed metallo - dielectric structures with cpbg s below infrared wavelengths @xcite and for new types of lasers involving photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "more realistic calculations involving dispersion of the dielectric constant and including transmission and reflection properties of finite layered structures will appear elsewhere .",
