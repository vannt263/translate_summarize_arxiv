    "-0.2 cm heisenberg - type models have been studied in great detail during the last twenty years because of their phenomenological importance .",
    "for example , it is believed that the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice is the correct model for understanding the undoped precursors of high @xmath9 cuprates ( undoped antiferromagnets ) .",
    "further , due to the availability of efficient monte carlo algorithms as well as the increasing power of computing resources , properties of undoped antiferromagnets on geometrically non - frustrated lattices have been determined to unprecedented accuracy @xcite .",
    "for instance , using a loop algorithm , the low - energy parameters of the spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the square lattice are calculated very precisely and are in quantitative agreement with the experimental results @xcite . despite being well studied ,",
    "several recent numerical investigation of anisotropic heisenberg models have led to unexpected results @xcite .",
    "in particular , monte carlo evidence indicates that the anisotropic heisenberg model with staggered arrangement of the antiferromagnetic couplings may belong to a new universality class , in contradiction to the theoretical @xmath7 universality prediction @xcite .",
    "for example , while the most accurate monte carlo value for the critical exponent @xmath6 in the @xmath7 universality class is given by @xmath10 @xcite , the corresponding @xmath6 determined in @xcite is shown to be @xmath11 .",
    "although subtlety of calculating the critical exponent @xmath6 from performing finite - size scaling analysis is demonstrated for a similar anisotropic heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite , the discrepancy between @xmath12 and @xmath10 observed in @xcite remains to be understood .    in order to clarify this issue further , we have simulated the spin-1/2 heisenberg model with a spatially staggered anisotropy on the square lattice .",
    "further , we choose to analyze the finite - size scaling of the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 refers to the box size used in the simulations and @xmath3 with @xmath4 is the spin stiffness in @xmath5-direction .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath0 and @xmath1 is twofold .",
    "first of all , these two observables can be calculated to a very high accuracy using loop algorithms .",
    "secondly , one can measure @xmath13 and @xmath14 separately . in practice",
    ", one would naturally use @xmath15 which is the average of @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the data analysis .",
    "however for the model considered here , we find it is useful to analyze both the data of @xmath13 and @xmath14 because studying @xmath13 and @xmath14 individually might reveal the impact of anisotropy on the system .",
    "surprisingly , as we will show later , the observable @xmath1 receives a much less severe correction than @xmath0 does .",
    "hence @xmath1 is a better observable than @xmath0 ( or @xmath16 ) for finite - size scaling analysis concerning the limitation of the availability of large volumes data in this study .",
    "further , motivated by the so - called cubical regime in magnon chiral perturbation theory , we have performed an additional finite - size scaling analysis on @xmath0 with the assumption that the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared is fixed in all our monte - carlo simulations . in other word",
    ", we keep the physical shape of the system fixed in the additional analysis of finite - size scaling .",
    "the validity of this new idea is confirmed by studying the phase transition driven by spatial anisotropy for the ladder anisotropic heisenberg model , namely the critical point and critical exponent @xmath6 for this phase transition we obtain by fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared are consistent with the known results in the literature .",
    "remarkably , combining the idea of fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations and finite - size scaling analysis , unlike the unconventional value for @xmath6 observed in @xcite , even from @xmath0 which suffers a very serious correction , we arrive at a value for @xmath6 which is consistent with that of @xmath7 by using only up to @xmath17 data points .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , the anisotropic heisenberg model and the relevant observables studied in this work are briefly described .",
    "section [ results ] contains our numerical results .",
    "in particular , the corresponding critical point as well as the critical exponent @xmath6 are determined by fitting the numerical data to their predicted critical behavior near the transition .",
    "finally , we conclude our study in section [ discussion ] .        -0.5",
    "cm    -0.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm the heisenberg model considered in this study is defined by the hamilton operator @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are antiferromagnetic exchange couplings connecting nearest neighbor spins @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    ", one can determine the critical point as well as the critical exponent @xmath6 with high precision .",
    "cm    -0.5 cm    -0.2 cm",
    "-0.2 cm to calculate the relevant critical exponent @xmath6 and to determine the location of the critical point in the parameter space @xmath28 , one useful technique is to study the finite - size scaling of certain observables . for example , if the transition is second order , then near the transition , the observable @xmath30 for @xmath31 should be described well by the following finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath32 where @xmath33 stands for @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the physical linear length of the system , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 is some constant , @xmath6 is the critical exponent corresponding to the correlation length @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the confluent correction exponent .",
    "finally @xmath41 appearing above is a smooth function of the variable @xmath42 . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath35 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) is conventionally replaced by the box size @xmath2 used in the simulations when performing finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "we will adopt this conventional strategy in the first part of our analysis as well . from eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , one concludes that the curves of different @xmath2 for @xmath43 , as functions of @xmath28 , should have the tendency to intersect at critical point @xmath44 for large @xmath2 . to calculate the critical exponent @xmath6 and the critical point @xmath44 , in the following we will apply the finite - size scaling formula , eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . without losing the generality , in our simulations",
    "we have fixed @xmath19 to be @xmath45 and have varied @xmath20 .",
    "further , the box size used in the simulations ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath8 .",
    "we also use large enough @xmath26 so that the observables studied here take their zero - temperature values .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the monte carlo data of @xmath16 and @xmath1 as functions of the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the figure clearly indicates the phase transition is likely second order since different @xmath2 curves for both @xmath16 and @xmath1 tend to intersect at a particular point in the parameter space @xmath28 .",
    "what is the most striking observation from our results is that the observable @xmath16 receives a much severe correction than @xmath1 does .",
    "this can be understood from the trend of the crossing among these curves of different @xmath2 in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "therefore one expects a better determination of @xmath6 can be obtained by applying finite - size scaling analysis to @xmath1 . before presenting our results , we would like to point out that since data from large volumes might be essential in order to determine the critical exponent @xmath6 accurately as suggested in @xcite , we will use the strategy employed in @xcite for our data analysis as well . a taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) up to fourth order in @xmath47 is used to fit the data of @xmath1 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath6 and critical point @xmath44 calculated from the fit using all the available data of @xmath48 are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig2 ] demonstrates the result of the fit .",
    "notice both @xmath6 and @xmath44 we obtain are consistent with the corresponding results found in @xcite . by eliminating some data points of small @xmath2",
    ", we can reach a value of @xmath51 for @xmath6 by fitting @xmath1 with @xmath52 to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) . on the other hand , with the same range of @xmath2 ( @xmath52 ) , a fit of @xmath16 to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) leads to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , both of which are consistent with those obtained in @xcite as well ( lower panel in figure [ fig2 ] ) . by eliminating more data points of @xmath55 with small @xmath2 ,",
    "the values for @xmath6 and @xmath44 calculated from the fits are always consistent with those quoted above .",
    "what we have shown clearly indicates that one would suffer the least correction by considering the finite - size scaling of the observable @xmath56 . as a result",
    ", it is likely one can reach a value for @xmath6 consistent with the @xmath7 prediction , namely @xmath10 if large volume data points for @xmath14 are available .",
    "here we do not attempt to carry out such task of obtaining data for @xmath57 .",
    "instead , we employ the technique of fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations . surprisingly , combining this new idea and finite - size scaling analysis , even from the observable @xmath0 which is found to receive the most severe correction among the observables considered here , we reach a value for the critical exponent @xmath6 consistent with @xmath10 without additionally obtaining data points for @xmath57 . the motivation behind the idea of fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations is as follows .",
    "first of all , as we already mentioned earlier that the box size @xmath2 used in the simulations is conventionally used as the @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) when carrying out finite - size scaling analysis . for isotropic systems ,",
    "such strategy is no problem .",
    "however , for anisotropic cases , the validity of this common wisdom of treating @xmath2 as @xmath35 is not clear . in particular",
    ", the same @xmath2 does not stand for the same @xmath35 of the system for two different anisotropies @xmath28 .",
    "hence one needs to find a physical quantity which can really characterize the physical linear length of the system . secondly , in magnon chiral perturbation theory which is the low - energy effective field theory for spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with @xmath58 symmetry , an exactly cubical space - time box is met when the condition @xmath59 is satisfied , here @xmath60 is the spin - wave velocity and @xmath26 , @xmath2 are the inverse temperature and box size as before . for spin-1/2 xy model on the square lattice , for large box size @xmath2 , the numerical value of c determined by @xmath61 using the @xmath26 with which one obtains @xmath62 in the monte carlo simulations agrees quantitatively with the known results in the literature @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the squares of winding numbers are more physical than the box sizes since an exactly cubical space - time box is reached when the squares of spatial and temporal winding numbers are tuned to be the same in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "consequently the physical linear lengths of the system should be characterized by the squares of winding numbers , not the box sizes used in the simulations .",
    "based on what we have argued , it is @xmath63 , not @xmath64 , plays the role of the quantity @xmath65 for the system , here again we refer @xmath66 with @xmath4 as the physical linear length of the system in @xmath5-direction . as a result ,",
    "fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations corresponds to the situation that the physical shape of the system remains fixed in all calculations .",
    "indeed it is demonstrated in @xcite that rectangular lattice is more suitable than square lattice for studying the spatially anisotropic heisenberg model with different antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath67 , @xmath68 in 1- and 2-directions .",
    "the idea of fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared quantifies the method used in @xcite .",
    "the method of fixing the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared is employed as follows .",
    "first of all , we perform a trial simulation to determine a fixed value for the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared which we denote by @xmath69 and will be used later in all calculations . secondly , instead of fixing the aspect ratio of box sizes @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the simulations as in conventional finite - size scaling studies , we vary the variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath28 in order to satisfy the condition of a fixed ratio of spatial winding numbers squared .",
    "this step involves a controlled interpolation on the raw data points . in practice , for a fixed @xmath71 one performs simulations for a sequence @xmath72 .",
    "the criterion of a fixed ratio of spatial winding numbers squared is reached by tuning the parameter @xmath73 and then carrying out a linear interpolation based on @xmath74 for the desired observables , here @xmath75 refers to the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared of the data points other than the trial one .",
    "notice since only the ratio of the physical linear lengths squared is fixed , it is natural to use @xmath71 in the finite - size scaling ansatz eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) both for the analysis of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the validity of this unconventional finite - size scaling method can be verified by considering the transition induced by dimerization for the heisenberg model with a ladder pattern anisotropic couplings ( figure [ fig0.5 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , we obtain a good data collapse for the observable @xmath77 . above the subscript `` in ''",
    "means the data points are the interpolated one . to make sure that the step of interpolation leads to accurate results ,",
    "we have carried out several trial simulations and have confirmed that the interpolated data points are reliable as long as the ratio is kept small ( table 1 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , a good data collapse is also obtained for the observable @xmath79 , here @xmath13 are the raw data determined from the simulations directly .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a comparison between the data collapse obtained by using the new unconventional method introduced above ( upper panel ) and by the conventional method ( lower panel ) .",
    "for obtaining figure [ fig3 ] , we have fixed @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , which are the established values for these quantities . as one sees in figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the quality of the data collapse obtained with the new method is better than the one obtained with the conventional method , thus confirming the validity of the idea to fix the ratio of winding numbers squared in order to studying the critical theory of a second order phase transition .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .comparison between interpolated and original values of @xmath13 for several data points .",
    "the data points which are used for interpolation are obtained from the simulations with @xmath83 ( except the last row which is obtained from a simulation with @xmath84 ) .",

    "cm    as demonstrated above , in general for a fixed @xmath71 , one can vary @xmath70 and @xmath28 in order to reach the criterion of a fixed aspect - ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations . for our study here , without obtaining additional data , we proceed as follows .",
    "first of all , we calculate the ratio @xmath63 for the data point at @xmath86 and @xmath87 which we denote by @xmath69 .",
    "we further choose @xmath88 in our data analysis .",
    "after obtaining this number , a linear interpolation for @xmath13 of other data points based on @xmath89 is performed in order to reach the criterion of a fixed ratio of spatial winding numbers squared in the simulations .",
    "the @xmath75 appearing above is again the corresponding @xmath63 of other data points . here",
    "a controlled interpolation similar to what we have done in studying the ladder anisotropic heisenberg model is performed as well .",
    "further , since large volumes data is essential for a quick convergence of @xmath6 as suggested in @xcite , we make sure the set of interpolated data chosen for finite - size scaling analysis contains sufficiently many points from large volumes as long as the interpolated results are reliable .",
    "a fit of the interpolated @xmath90 data to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) with @xmath40 being fixed to its @xmath7 value ( @xmath81 ) leads to @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "letting @xmath40 be a fit parameter results in consistent @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "further , we always arrive at consistent results with @xmath91 and @xmath96 from the fits using @xmath97 data .",
    "the value of @xmath6 we calculate from the fit is in good agreement with the expected @xmath7 value @xmath10 .",
    "the critical point @xmath96 is consistent with that found in @xcite as well . to avoid any bias",
    ", we perform another analysis for the raw @xmath98 data with the same range of @xmath2 and @xmath28 as we did for the interpolated data . by fitting this set of original data points to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) with a fixed @xmath81 , we arrive at @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) , both of which again agree quantitatively with those determined in @xcite .",
    "similarly , applying this unconventional finite - size scaling to @xmath14 would lead to a numerical value of @xmath6 consistent with @xmath101 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath6 determined by fitting @xmath102 to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) is found to be @xmath91 , which agrees quantitatively with the predicted @xmath7 value ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "finally we would like to make a comment regarding the choice of @xmath69 . in principle",
    "one can use @xmath69 determined from any @xmath2 and from any @xmath28 close to @xmath44 . however it will be desirable to choose @xmath69 such that the set of interpolated data used for analysis includes as many data points from large volumes as possible . using the @xmath69 obtained at @xmath103 ( @xmath86 ) with @xmath87 ( @xmath104 ) , we reach the results of @xmath105 and @xmath96 ( @xmath106 and @xmath96 ) from the fit with a fixed @xmath81 . these values for @xmath6 and @xmath44 agree with what we have obtained earlier .",
    "indeed as we will demonstrate in another investigation , the critical exponent @xmath6 determined by the idea of fixing the ratio of spatial winding number squared in the simulations is independence of the chosen reference point .",
    "-0.2 cm in this paper , we revisit the phase transition driven by dimerization for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model with a spatially staggered anisotropy on the square lattice .",
    "we find that the observable @xmath1 suffers a much less severe correction compared to that of @xmath0 , hence is a better quantity for finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "further , we propose an unconventional finite - size scaling method , namely we fix the ratio of spatial winding numbers squared . as a result ,",
    "the physical shape of the system remains fixed in all simulations and analysis . with this new strategy",
    ", we arrive at @xmath107 for the critical exponent @xmath6 which is consistent with the most accurate monte carlo @xmath7 result @xmath101 by using only up to @xmath8 data points derived from both @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath108 obtained from the fits using the interpolated data are better than those resulted from the fits using the raw data ( figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this observation provides another evidence to support the quantitative correctness of the new unconventional finite - size scaling we proposed here .",
    "it seems that when carrying out the finite - size scaling analysis for the observables considered here , the use of physical linear lengths of the system , which are charaterized by the spatial winding numbers squared , would lead to a faster convergence of @xmath6 .",
    "it will be interesting to apply a similar technique to other observables such as binder cumulants as well .",
    "however , for binder cumulants , the correction from interpolation will cancel out because of the definition of these observables . therefore to further test the philosophy behind the unconventional finite - size scaling method proposed here might require some new ideas . nevertheless , with this new unconventional finite - size scaling method , we have successfully solved the puzzle raised in @xcite by showing that the anisotropy driven phase transition for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model with a staggered spatial anisotropy indeed belongs to the @xmath7 universality class .",
    "of course , the conventional finite - size scaling analysis is more convenient since one does not need to carry out interpolation on the raw data .",
    "however for the subtle phase transition considered in this study , without obtaining data of gigantic lattices , a new idea which is more physical oriented such as the one presented here is necessary .",
    "still , to clarify the puzzle of an unconventional phase transition for the model studied here as observed in @xcite by simulating larger lattices and using the conventional finite - size scaling method is desirable .",
