    "in conjunction with professor i. koltracht and several students in the mathematics department of the university of connecticut , we are in the process of developing a method@xcite for solving the one - dimensional lippmann - schwinger integral equations in configuration space , associated with the corresponding schrdinger equation . at a later stage",
    "we hope to generalize the method to other types of integral equations , and attempt to increase the dimension of the number of variables .",
    "our method is excellently suited for cases where either the potential has a long range with many oscillations occurring in the wave function , or for large systems of coupled equations in which some of the channel energies are positive and others negative . in both situations the conventional finite difference methods ( numerov , for example ) experience difficulties because of the larger accumulation of roundoff errors , and because of linear independence problems in implementing the asymptotic boundary conditions in the coupled channel case .",
    "a good physical application of our method is very likely the process of photoassociation in the collision of cold atoms , because of the very long range of the interaction between the atoms , and also because of the many excited configurations which participate and which lead to many coupled channels .",
    "photoassociation is a relatively new field of study .",
    "it was recently reviewed by julienne@xcite , and is observed experimentally at various laboratories , including the university of connecticut@xcite .",
    "the calculation of three - body reactions in coordinate space might furnish another example because of the large distances involved , especially if we are able to generalize our method to two dimensions , but this conjecture has not yet been examined .",
    "the chebyshev expansion method is  spectral ",
    ", i.e. , the accuracy increases faster than any inverse power of the number of mesh points employed .",
    "our method is based on that of greengard and rokhlin@xcite , but differs@xcite from it substantially in the manner in which the local solutions in each partition are combined into the global solution .",
    "we prefer to use chebyshev polynomials for the expansion basis in each partition because these functions have excellent integral properties@xcite , and the node points can be obtained in terms of simple algebraic cosine expressions , rather than in terms of non - analytic expressions required for the zeros of legendre polynomials , for example .",
    "for the one - channel case our integral equation method ( iem ) is as follows .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the partial wave function @xmath0@xmath1 is first transformed into an equivalent integral equation @xmath2 in configuration space the green s function @xmath3 is semi - separable , i.e. , it is given by the product of two independent solutions @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the schrdinger equation , i.e. , @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 is the smaller ( larger ) of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the driving function which is equal to @xmath4 in the uncoupled case , and the upper limit in the integral is @xmath14 .",
    "physicists would be tempted to use instead of @xmath4 and @xmath5 the l - dependent riccati - bessel functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but because the spectral expansion technique is very robust , it allows us to place the @xmath17 term into the potential @xmath18@xmath19 without loss of accuracy@xcite .",
    "we avoid the occurrence of large non - sparse matrices by : a ) dividing the integration interval @xmath20 $ ] into @xmath21 partitions @xmath22,[b_{1},b_{2}], ... \\;[b_{m-1},r_{max}]$ ] .",
    "the size of each partition can be arbitrary , but two or three partitions per local wave number is optimum .",
    "b ) solving the integral equation separately in each partition @xmath23 for two functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 the method of solution for this step leads to small non - sparse matrices .",
    "it consists in expanding the unknown solutions into chebyshev polynomials and making use of their convenient properties [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "c )  stitching  together the separate solutions into the global one by means of the expressions , valid in each partition @xmath27 this  stitching  procedure leads to a large but sparse matrix .",
    "it produces a seamless smooth continuation of the function @xmath28 from one partition into the next , and is a consequence of the semi - separability of @xmath29 . as a consequence of this property the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 obey@xcite the matrix equation @xmath32 \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } \\alpha _ { 1 } \\\\",
    "\\alpha _ { 2 } \\\\   \\vdots \\\\   \\vdots \\\\",
    "\\alpha _ { m-1 } \\\\",
    "\\alpha _ { m } \\end{array }",
    "\\right ) = \\left (   \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\   0 \\\\   \\vdots \\\\",
    "\\vdots \\\\   0 \\\\   u \\end{array } \\right ) .\\ ] ] where the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two - rowed columns @xmath35    for the one - channel case the @xmath36 are @xmath37 matrices whose elements are formed out of overlap integrals between combinations of the functions @xmath38 the potential @xmath39 and the functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we call the matrix formed out of the blocks of the @xmath42s the  big matrix  .",
    "it is sparse , and of dimension @xmath43 where @xmath21 is the number of partitions , while the matrices required to solve the equations for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 in each partition are of the dimension @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of chebyshev points in each partition .",
    "following standard practice , that number is chosen to have the value @xmath46 the end result of the whole calculation is the set of coefficients of the chebyshev polynomials for the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in each partition , as well as the coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each partition .",
    "the calculations in one partition of the @xmath38 and the overlap integrals required for the construction of the @xmath47 can be performed independently of each other .",
    "hence this part of the calculation can be carried out in a parallel computer architecture . because of the simple structure of the  big matrix  , the solution of eq .",
    "( 7 ) can be performed by simple pivoting , and does not require special big matrix techniques .",
    "the values of @xmath28 and its derivative @xmath48 can be obtained at any arbitrary point from the solution given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , because the values and the derivatives of chebyshev functions are known analytically . at the end point",
    "@xmath49 the expression for @xmath48 is especially simple .    when the schrdinger eq .",
    "is augmented to a system of coupled equations with @xmath50 channels , then each @xmath51 and the corresponding @xmath24 is augmented into @xmath50 column vectors of length @xmath52 and similarly for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 the size of the block matrices @xmath47 increases correspondingly to the dimension @xmath55 , but the sparse structure of the  big matrix  remains the same . for the channels which are closed , the functions @xmath51 and @xmath56 are replaced by @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , where @xmath59 is the imaginary part of the asymptotic wave number in the closed channel .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite for @xmath60 show that the stability and high precision of the results is maintained in this case also , provided that a scaling procedure is introduced which reduces the numerical disparity between the two exponentials @xmath61 for large values of @xmath62 if in the positive energy channels the angular momentum @xmath63 it is still advantageous to use for the channel green functions the undistorted @xmath64 ones , even though one now has to solve the coupled integral equations as many times as there are open channels , each time with a different driving function @xmath65 the big matrix @xmath66 is the same in each case , the only change is in the vector @xmath34 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and one can show@xcite that the corresponding solutions are linearly independent asymptotically . in the next section",
    "several examples illustrate the numerical properties of our method .",
    "this property is demonstrated by a numerical example for an uncoupled channel case with @xmath63 but in which the only potential present is @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the solution is a riccati - bessel function @xmath67 the numerical solution @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is proportional to @xmath68 and the constant of proportionality is obtained from the wronskian of @xmath28 with @xmath16 at @xmath69 the calculations are done in double precision on a ibm 3090 mainframe machine .",
    "the functions @xmath70 and @xmath15 at @xmath71 are obtained from the international mathematical scientific library ( imsl ) .",
    "the error in the numerical solution @xmath72 is obtained by comparing it with the imsl values of f@xmath73 at many points in the interval @xmath20,$ ] and the maximum of the absolute values of all these differences is denoted as  error  .",
    "this error is plotted in fig . 1 as a function of @xmath52 the total number of integration points in @xmath74.$ ] for the iem that number is equal to 16 times the number of partitions @xmath75 while for the numerov method",
    "it is @xmath71 divided by the uniform mesh size . in this example with @xmath76 @xmath77and @xmath78 one sees that the error rapidly drops as a function of @xmath52 and reaches a minimum ( equal to machine accuracy in this case ) at the point where the roundoff error overtakes the truncation error . beyond that minimum",
    "the rise is a measure of the rapidity of accumulation of roundoff error .",
    "one sees from the figure that the numerov error decreases much more slowly with @xmath79 and the accumulation of round - off error increases much faster .",
    "this is the reason why the best accuracy for the numerov method is much worse .",
    "a variable step size improved numerov method due to raptis and cash@xcite accumulates roundoff error more slowly than the numerov method , but still does not reach the quality of the iem .    a more taxing example with @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 ( not illustrated here ) shows a similarly slow accumulation of the roundoff error for the iem . in this case there are 580 nodes in the wave function , and the smallest error is one order of magnitude larger than machine accuracy@xcite .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath50 is @xmath83 which corresponds to 800 partitions in the @xmath20 $ ] interval , or 20 chebyshev points per half wavelength .",
    "the corresponding number for best accuracy ( @xmath84 of the numerov method is 640 points per half wavelength , larger by a factor of 30 .",
    "there results are summarized in the table below .",
    "maximum accuracy of the riccati - bessel function .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for the case of one channel the asymptotic boundary conditions @xmath85 are easily obtained in both the iem and the finite difference methods ( fdm ) , by simple normalization at the end point .",
    "however if there are two or more coupled channels , then the various supposedly independent wave functions obtained in the fdm by starting the solutions near the origin independently , can loose a large part of their independence near the matching point , and the process of obtaining the appropriate linear combination which satisfies the desired boundary condition looses accuracy .",
    "this is not the case for the iem , as will now be demonstrated for the case @xmath86    in this example@xcite we have two channels , both with the same positive energy @xmath87 and all potentials ( coupling as well as diagonal ) are of exponential form @xmath88 with the same decay parameter @xmath89 and the same magnitude of the strength @xmath90 for the single channel @xmath60 case there exists an analytic solution given in terms of bessel functions @xmath91 of imaginary index @xmath92 and argument @xmath93 which can be generalized to the coupled channel case when the energies in all the channels are equal . in our example",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "channel 1 is the incident channel , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 while in channel 2 @xmath98 and @xmath99 the value of @xmath71 is @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , in the iem and numerov calculations , again carried out in double precision on the ibm mainframe . for each value of",
    "the wave number @xmath102 the number of points in each method of calculation is varied until the combined error in @xmath103 and @xmath104 is a minimum , and this minimum error is displayed on the vertical axis in fig .",
    "2 . the reason why the numerov error ( open circles ) increases as @xmath102 decreases is because of the lack of independence of the two solutions .",
    "this is shown either by an analytical argument@xcite , valid in this exponential case , or can seen from the fact that the numerov error for @xmath105 in the uncoupled channels is much less dependent on @xmath106 the latter is shown by the lines with squares or triangles , labeled  attr .  and  rep .",
    " , respectively .",
    "the error in the iem is even more independent on @xmath107 and is also much smaller since the boundary conditions are automatically built into the green s functions .",
    "the case with the same exponential potentials in which however the energy in the second channel is negative has also been examined .",
    "since an analytical solution does not exist in this case , the accuracy of the solution has to be inferred from the stability of the values of @xmath103 and @xmath108 for the iem the values of both @xmath103 and @xmath104 are stable to 13 sign figures , while for the numerov method the value of @xmath104 is correct to less than 4 significant figures for @xmath109while @xmath103 is correct to about 7 .",
    "we have demonstrated a method for solving the lippmann - schwinger integral equation in configuration space which is linear in the number of the integration points , and which is numerically very stable .",
    "the stability of the iem method is due to two factors : 1 .",
    "the solution of integral equations lead to a smaller accumulation of roundoff errors than the finite difference methods of solving a differential equation , and 2 ) , the iem is a spectral method , which has an inherently higher accuracy than finite difference methods .    furthermore the iem is easy to implement : a ) _ the _ _ boundary conditions _ on the channel wave functions are automatically incorporated through the green s functions ; b ) _ the size of each partition _ @xmath110 can be assigned independently of the sizes of the other partitions ; c ) the _ overlap integrals _ required for the construction of matrix elements can be obtained with the gauss - legendre quadrature because the functions in the integrand , being given in terms of chebyshev expansions , can be calculated easily for any given sets of points , no interpolation being required .",
    "the curtis - clenshaw ( c - c ) quadrature@xcite is also a good option ( see table 2 in ref.@xcite ) because the wave functions and potentials are already known at the appropriate chebyshev points , and certainly exceeds the efficiency of equidistant point methods .",
