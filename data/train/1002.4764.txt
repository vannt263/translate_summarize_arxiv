    "the problem of magnetoresistance in the hoping transport was addressed decades ago . in particular , an interest to this topic was related to important additional information provided by corresponding experiments ( including estimates of the localization length ) .",
    "the most general and natural mechanism of positive magnetoresistance of orbital nature is related to shrinkage of the localized wave function by magnetic field ; it was extensively reviewed in @xcite .",
    "then another important mechanism of orbital magnetoresistance was considered by nguen , shklovskii and spivak ( for the review see @xcite ) .",
    "it is related to a presence of under - barrier scattering of hopping electrons by intermediate hopping sites and to interference between different hopping trajectories .",
    "note that for the effective interference the difference of lengths of different trajectories should not exceed the localization length which restrict the location of the trajectories to so - called `` cigar region '' .",
    "a significance of this mechanism was emphasized by the factor of exponentially - broad scatter of hopping probabilities corresponding to different `` hopping resistors '' . as a result of `` logarithmic averaging '' over different configurations the most important role",
    "is played by those interference patterns where the total hopping probability almost vanishes as a result of the destructive interference .",
    "the magnetic field suppresses the interference and thus the average effect is _ negative _ magnetoresistance which appears to be linear at weak magnetic field ( although becoming quadratic at @xmath0 ) .",
    "an important features of the approach discussed in @xcite were as follows .",
    "first , the authors exploited an assumption of a presence of many intermediate scatterers .",
    "second , following the theory @xcite , the authors assumed the preexponential factor to be equal to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is scattering amplitude , @xmath3 is a distance between the hopping site and the scattering center .",
    "the picture of interference magnetoresistance considered in @xcite was very rich including a change of the sign of magnetoresistance , effects of spin glass etc .",
    "somewhat later the problem was also discussed in @xcite , @xcite where it was noticed that in realistic situations the number of intermediate scatterers is small and most probably equal to one or ( in average ) even less .",
    "another important ingredient of the paper @xcite was a usage of wave functions typical for coulomb centers which have not contained preexponential depending on @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the `` scattering states '' of @xcite which contained preexponential factors decaying with @xmath3 , this situation can be specified as `` strong scattering case '' .",
    "note that , although in @xcite the authors considered 2d hopping , they addressed to the case of delta - doped layer and thus the asymptotic of the wave functions was similar to 3d .",
    "the important result of theory suggested in @xcite was the following : the patterns of the negative magnetoresistance were almost universal predicting the maximum value of @xmath4 of the total resistance , and even the combination of the negative magnetoresistanse and positive wave - shrinkage magnetoresistance gave the maximum value of negative peak ( with respect to average resistance ) of around 40 percents .    unfortunately , these predictions for `` strong scattering case '' were not in a good agreement with experiment .",
    "first , in most of experimental studies the effect of negative magnetoresistance have not exceeded 10 percents and typically was around several percents .",
    "then , it was shown @xcite that in 3d semiconductors the negative magnetoresistance is suppressed with a decrease of temperature after the crossover from mott - type hopping ( at higher temperatures ) to efros - shklovskii hopping over the states within the coulomb gap . in the paper",
    "@xcite we explained such a behavior as a result of a decrease of concentration of the scattering centers within the coulomb gap .",
    "however our calculations were based on the assumption that the preexponential factor of the wave functions asymptotic corresponded to scattering states of @xcite ( `` weak scattering case '' ) rather than to hydrogen - like asymptotics exploited in @xcite .",
    "later @xcite we have also demonstrated that to fit the experimental data one should also take into account spin mechanisms of magnetoresistance . the first one , considered in @xcite , is based on the fact that the intermediate scatterer should be occupied to produce a negative scattering amplitude .",
    "thus the interference depends on the mutual orientation of the spin of the hopping electron and of the spin of scattering center . without external magnetic field only one half of the configurations gives an interference . in magnetic field",
    "all localized spins are aligned which increases the role of interference and , correspondingly , leads to an increase of resistance .",
    "another spin mechanism of positive magnetoresistance was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and then was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is related to a presence of doubly - occupied hopping sites ( corresponding to the upper hubbard band ) . due to spin correlations on these sites requiring s - pairing of the spins ( recall that we consider here electron rather than hole hopping )",
    "some hopping transitions are suppressed in magnetic field ( like ones from single - occupied site to single - occupied site ) .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the incorporation of all of the relevant factors allowed us to reach a quantitative agreement between the theoretical model and experimental data .",
    "however basing the scattering state asymptotic we exploited an assumption of correlated impurity configurations which had no solid theoretical prove .",
    "another important request to the theory of hopping magnetoresistance was related to 2d hopping . as we have mentioned above ,",
    "the theoretical model of @xcite exploited 3d localized wave functions which do not hold for typical experiments for doped quantum wells where the wave functions have 2d character .",
    "then , we should mention a new important experimental results @xcite,@xcite obtained for selectively - doped quantum well structures where both centers of the wells and centers of the barriers were doped ensuring a formation of the upper hubbard band .",
    "these structures demonstrated a suppression of negative magnetoresistance with a decrease of temperature for the samples with higher degree of doping .",
    "although we attempted to explain this behavior in a similar way as for 3d structures in @xcite , it hardly works because of an important difference between 2d and 3d physics .    in what follows",
    "we will give a consistent description of magnetoresistance in both 3d and 2d structures including different orbital and spin mechanisms .",
    "an important conclusion of ours is that in most occasions one deals with a `` weak scattering case '' rather than with `` strong scattering case '' .",
    "if we are restricted to the lower hubbard band , the decisive factor is related to the presence of charged centers outside of the `` cigar region '' not involved into interference .",
    "the random potential imposed by these centers restricts the extension of the hydrogen - like asymptotics of the scattering centers up to the distance to the closest charged center while outside this region the preexponential of the asymptotics appears to be similar to the one for the potential well case ( `` weak scattering limit '' ) . for the case of the states within the upper hubbard band an additional factor",
    "is related to the non - coulombic potential of the scattering center which is also of a short - range character .",
    "the resulting picture of hopping magnetoresistance appears to be different from the one suggested in @xcite ( based on the pure coulomb wave functions ) and from the one of @xcite ( exploiting the assumption of large number of intermediate scatterers ) .",
    "we also emphasize a role of spin mechanisms of positive magnetoresistance which can dominate over wave - shrinkage magnetoresistance at low temperature . in this concern a special analysis is given to spin mechanisms for acceptor centers which have an important differences with respect to the earlier discussed case of donor impurities .",
    "let us consider negative magnetoresistance in 3d case . as it was mentioned above ,",
    "an important ingredient to be included with respect to the previous studies is a random potential imposed by the intermediate charged centers ( including both donors and acceptors ) .",
    "we shall start from a solution of a schrodinger equation @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the potential of impurity ( @xmath7 in the case of hydrogen - like impurity level ) and @xmath8 is random potential that comes from the charged centers mentioned above , @xmath9 is the electron mass in the conduction band ( or a hole mass in valence band ) and @xmath10 is exact electron energy ( we consider @xmath11 ) .    because of the fact that typical hopping lengths are much larger then characteristic localization length @xmath12 , we can solve ( [ shred3d ] ) at @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the typical hopping length @xmath14 appears to be much larger than typical distance between charged centers which can be roughly estimated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a dopant concentration . indeed , for 3d variable range hopping of the mott type @xmath17 where @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of states , @xmath20 being bohr energy .",
    "thus one obtains @xmath21 that is even for the mott law @xmath22 .",
    "the more so it holds for the coulomb gap regime where @xmath14 strongly exceeds the corresponding values for the mott regime .",
    "thus we are interested in asymptotics of the wave functions at distances much larger than @xmath23 which for moderately compensated material can be considered as the correlation length of the random potential imposed by the charged centers .",
    "if so , we can make an important conclusion .",
    "namely , the random potential @xmath24 is formed by the long - range coulomb centers and in this sense the potential produced by the `` parent '' ( for the considered wave function ) impurity at distances larger than @xmath15 makes no difference with respect to potential produced by other charged centers . in other words , for @xmath25 one should not discriminate between @xmath24 and @xmath26 and should assume that the resulting potential @xmath24 has a spatial average equal to zero .",
    "having in mind that @xmath27 we approach the problem of the asymptotics of the wave function by means of the wkb method .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath28 with an account of the normalization factor for the function @xmath29 as : @xmath30 .",
    "the shroedinger equation in 3d case leads to @xmath31 .",
    "in zero order we have @xmath32 this order gives us the exponent . to get the pre - exponent factor",
    "we should use the first order of perturbation theory .",
    "here we have in mind that the function @xmath33 at large @xmath3 is actually a constant - the more so that its linear expansion in @xmath34 is averaged out .",
    "@xmath35    accordingly the expression for @xmath28 up to the first order is @xmath36 where @xmath37 . and finally the wavefunction @xmath29 is @xmath38    having in mind the considerations given above , we can average @xmath39 where @xmath40 note that @xmath41 differs from @xmath42 only in second order of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , as the mean value @xmath45 is zero .",
    "also we neglect @xmath24 in the pre - exponent factor .",
    "so at distances from the scattering center larger than the correlation length of the random potential ( assumed to be equal to average distance between the charged centers ) the wave function asymptotics has a preexponential factor @xmath46 which agrees with the scheme exploited in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for 3d hopping .",
    "now , following approaches @xcite , @xcite let us estimate the hopping probability between the sites 1 and 2 in a presence of intermediate `` scattering center '' with an account that the energies of the centers obey a relation @xmath47 as @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 are hoping amplitudes related to direct and scattered path correspondingly .",
    "note that the destructive interference ( leading to negative magnetoresistance ) implies that @xmath51 ) which means that in the equilibrium the scattering site is occupied .",
    "the energy overlapping integrals are given as @xmath52 where we have assumed that @xmath53 ; @xmath54 being the bohr energy . without a magnetic field this amplitudes are real .",
    "though in the magnetic field their phases are different and hoping probability is @xmath55 here phase difference @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the magnetic flux through the surface bounded by hoping paths .",
    "@xmath59 is the elementary magnetic flux .",
    "accordingly , the interference magnetoresistance for the situation @xmath60 can be given as @xmath61 d^3 r_3 \\right>,\\ ] ] here @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the density of states and @xmath64 is scatterer position .",
    "angle brackets corresponds to the ensemble average .",
    "we consider magnetoresistance to be determined over hops with small @xmath65 , so we neglect the term @xmath66 in ( [ 2dmr1 ] ) and get @xmath67 d^3 r_3 \\right>.\\ ] ] to obey @xmath68 one , first , should have @xmath69 with an accuracy of the order of localization length @xmath12 .",
    "then , having in mind the preexponential factors one notes that for small @xmath70 the only possibility to obey the relation is to have one of the distances , @xmath71 or @xmath72 to be small .",
    "we will assume that it holds for @xmath72 which is estimated as @xmath73 let us chose the surface at which @xmath74 and transform an integration over @xmath64 in a way @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the coordinate on the surface in question while @xmath77 is a coordinate along the normal to the surface where we assume that @xmath78 corresponds to @xmath79 . in the lowest order in @xmath77 we have @xmath80 .",
    "as it is seen , the integration of the logarithm term over @xmath77 gives @xmath81 finally , the integration of the factor @xmath82 over @xmath83 approximately gives a volume accessible for the site 3 .",
    "note that we have @xmath84 , thus the projection of @xmath85 to the plane normal to @xmath86 should be less than @xmath87 . as a result",
    ", the integration over the spatial coordinate @xmath88 gives @xmath89 in its turn , the area of the interference loop ( entering the estimate of @xmath56 ) is @xmath90 note that these estimates actually hold for all accessible values of @xmath72 up to @xmath91 .",
    "the final result depends on the behavior of @xmath92 . for @xmath93 ( mott - type hopping )",
    "the integration over @xmath94 is naturally controlled by the lower limit which accordingly to eq .",
    "[ r23 ] corresponds to the larger possible value of @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the r.h.s . of eq.[2dmr1 ] is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast , for the coulomb gap hopping the integration over @xmath94 is controlled by the upper level , @xmath97 , corresponding to the edge of the coulomb gap . in this case",
    "r.h.s . of eq.[2dmr1 ] is @xmath98 since the value of @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "now let us consider a combination of nmr with a positive magnetoresistance related to wave function shrinkage which can be estimated as @xmath99 where @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a numerical parameter resulting from he percolation theory ; for mott type hopping @xmath102 @xcite while for the coulomb gap hopping different sources give @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    in its turn , nmr can be rewritten as @xmath105 where @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the dielectric constant",
    ", @xmath108 is the typical hopping length for the states corresponding to the edge of the coulomb gap while @xmath97 is a width of the coulomb gap .",
    "one sees that as a result we have minimum of resistance , @xmath109 it is seen that the value of @xmath110 decreases with a temperature decrease irrespectively to the type of the variable range hopping . at the same time for samples corresponding to mott law the absolute value of resistance in minimum _",
    "increases _ with a temperature decrease while for the case of the coulomb gap hopping it decreases with temperature decrease .",
    "let us now approach the problem of negative magnetoresistance in the 2d structure where impurity wave functions are quantized in the orthogonal to impurity plane direction .",
    "first we will consider the case when we deal only with single occupied or empty impurity centers ( as it was done above for 3d case ) .",
    "let us start with approximation of 2d impurity wave function in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "analogously to previous case we neglect @xmath111 and introduce function @xmath28 as @xmath112 .",
    "the corresponding wkb equation is @xmath113 analogously to 3d case this wave function is nearly equal to the potential well wave function @xmath114 where @xmath115 which differs from @xmath42 only in the second order of @xmath116 .",
    "now let us consider negative magnetoresistance related to the interference contribution to the hopping probability .",
    "following the same lines as for 3d case we obtain the equation similar to [ 2dmr2 ] except that the integration is over @xmath117 and the density of states @xmath63 also corresponds to 2d .",
    "an important difference is related to the fact that now the value of @xmath65 vanishes at @xmath118    with a similar transformation of the variables the integration of the logarithmic term over the coordinates gives @xmath119 while the effective loop area is @xmath120 since in 2d in the coulomb gap regime @xmath121 one notes that irrespectively to the hopping law the integration over @xmath94 is controlled by the lower possible values of @xmath94 leading finally to the estimates of @xmath122 .",
    "thus one obtains @xmath123 thus , at is seen , for the situation considered above in 2d the only combination of interference nmr and wave - shrinkage pmr can not lead to a suppression of nmr with a decrease of temperature ( at least for low temperature limit of linear nmr ) since for both laws the temperature derivative of @xmath41 stays to be negative .",
    "an important feature of the 2d quantum well structure is an easy possibility to have an occupation of the upper hubbard band .",
    "namely , if we dope not only the well regions , but also the barrier regions , the carriers from the barriers are captured by the wells and can form doubly occupied states .",
    "it was this situation which was realized in our experiments described in @xcite , @xcite . since in these experiments we dealt with gaas / algaas structures of quantum wells with p - doping by",
    "be , here we will also imply acceptor centers .    in our experiments",
    "the central regions of both wells and barriers were nearly equally doped by acceptor impurity be .",
    "thus the holes from the barriers have a possibility to occupy the second position for the acceptor in the wells forming the upper hubbard band .",
    "however for the hole there was another possibility - to stay around its native acceptor in the barrier forming single - occupied center which we will denote as @xmath124 .",
    "the corresponding scenario was first discussed in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "at the fermi level we have centers with different occupation numbers - at least , @xmath125 ( doubly occupied ) .",
    "@xmath126 ( single occupied ) @xmath127 ( holes bound to the barrier acceptor ) and @xmath128 ( empty barrier acceptor with no hole around ) .",
    "the possibility for the hole to form @xmath125 or @xmath124 center depends on relation between the binding energies of these centers , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath131 , then all the barrier acceptors form @xmath128 centers while all the acceptors in the well form @xmath125 centers .",
    "however for our experiments of the distance between the barrier acceptor and the interface between the barrier and well was not large and we expect @xmath132 . in this case the probability to form @xmath125 center depends on the distance between the barrier acceptor and the closest acceptor in the well .",
    "indeed , the formation of @xmath125 center profit from the interaction between @xmath125 center and @xmath126 center @xcite .",
    "here we assume that some holes from the barrier are still coupled to their parent acceptors ( @xmath133 centers ) and some are localized on the acceptors in the well ( @xmath125 centers ) . according to charge conservation",
    "the number of @xmath134 centers ( that are free @xmath133 centers ) is equal to the number of @xmath125 centers .",
    "@xmath135    in addition , we believe that there exists a random potential that overlap the energies of different types of centers .",
    "if the variances of @xmath133 and @xmath134 energies are equal , ( [ na0a+ ] ) leads to equal densities of states for @xmath133 and @xmath134 at the fermi level . for our purpose",
    "we assume that this densities of states are at least comparable .    as for the negative magnetoresistance for the upper hubbard band",
    ", it can be considered in the same way as for the lower hubbard band discussed above .",
    "note that the scattering potential strongly decays with distance @xmath136 and thus the corresponding asymptotics of the wave functions are similar to the one given by eq.[psi2 ] but one should take @xmath137 .",
    "we shall start from the mechanism of spin magnetoresistance first suggested in @xcite which seems to be especially important for acceptor dopants .",
    "it is related to the fact that interference can occur only if spin states of the final states for both tunneling paths coincide . for 3-cite configuration",
    "we discuss it means that the initial and intermediate centers should have the same spin projections ( we remind that for destructive interference in question the energy of intermediate center should be negative , i.e. at the equilibrium this center should be occupied ) . for the case of acceptor states corresponding to the lower hubbard band",
    "the corresponding configuration is in our case @xmath138 where the role of intermediate center is played by the site @xmath139 .",
    "since the hole has spin 3/2 , we have 4 projections of the spin and thus the probability for two sites @xmath139 to have the same spin projections is @xmath140 .",
    "however in strong magnetic field the site spins are aligned and spin does not affect the ( destructive ) interference , that is in this case @xmath141 .",
    "thus an increase of the magnetic field leads to an enhancement of destructive interference which means positive magnetoresistance which was noted in @xcite .    in a presence of the states representing the upper hubbard band ( in our case of @xmath125 and @xmath126 states )",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated . in particular , it is related to the fact that the spin structure of doubly occupied @xmath125 center is more complex than for single occupied site . in particular ,",
    "the total spin of @xmath125 center is 2 ( see @xcite ) and the possible spin states of @xmath125 center are the following : @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 where @xmath147 - are the wave functions characterized by given spin projections of the two holes . basing on these considerations one can show that for the destructive interference involving purely the states of the upper hubbard band , that is for configurations @xmath148 , @xmath149 while @xmath150    if the states of both of the hubbard bands coexist at the fermi level , it can be estimated that the average statistical factor @xmath151 is still of the order of 1/4 , although its value at strong fields , @xmath152 appears to be somewhat smaller than unity .    at weak magnetic fields one expects a degree of spin alignment to be @xmath153 and",
    "thus the statistical factor is equal @xmath154 here the coefficient @xmath101 according to more detailed statistical calculations which we are going to present elsewhere can be estimated to be of the order of 1/2 .",
    "since @xmath155 describes probability of the destructive interference , one concludes that at weak fields the positive magnetoresistance resulting from statistical factor @xmath155 is quadratic in terms of magnetic field .",
    "it can be estimated as follows : @xmath156 where and @xmath157 is the saturation value for the interference contribution to resistance with no account of spin degrees of freedom which is achieved when the phase @xmath56 in eq.[varphi ] exceeds @xmath158 . as it can be estimated , the ratio @xmath159 is @xmath98 for mott hopping and @xmath160 for the coulomb gap hopping .    in its turn , it coexists with linear negative magnetoresistance ( of orbital nature ) which at relatively weak fields can be estimated as @xmath161    as it is known , if at the fermi level the states of the lower and the upper hubbard bands coexist , there also exists a specific spin mechanism of positive magnetoresistance first considered in @xcite ( and later discussed in detail in @xcite ) for n - type 3d structures . in such structures one deals with @xmath162 ( occupied donors ) , @xmath163 ( doubly occupied donors ) and @xmath164 ( empty donors ) . without external magnetic field",
    "the following configurations of hops are possible : @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 . in the magnetic field",
    "the spins of @xmath162 centers are polarized and thus the hops @xmath169 are forbidden ( since in the final state of the second site corresponding to @xmath163 the spins should be in opposite directions ) . in the same way",
    "the transitions @xmath168 are also suppressed .",
    "thus the resistance increases as a result of application of external magnetic field .",
    "in our case of p - type structures the situation appears , again , more complicated due to more complex structure of @xmath125 centers .",
    "however , in general , the considerations given in @xcite , @xcite still hold . basing on the calculations similar to given in @xcite one obtains for weak field limit @xmath170 the following estimate : @xmath171 where @xmath172 , @xmath173 while @xmath174 , @xmath175 are the densities of states of the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "note that for the low concentration of dopants @xmath176 is controlled by the concentration of @xmath125 centers while @xmath177 - by the concentration of @xmath128 centers and thus @xmath178 . at stronger magnetic fields when @xmath179 , the corresponding contribution to magnetoresistance still increases with magnetic field increase until @xmath180 reaches the value @xmath181 and then saturates @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one notes that at low enough temperatures the positive magnetoresistance of the spin nature suggested in @xcite can exceed the wave shrinkage magnetoresistance .",
    "at the same time this contribution at relatively weak fields when @xmath182 is expected to be comparable to the spin magnetoresistance resulting from interference term discussed above . summarizing the both spin contributions to quadratic magnetoresistance we estimate the coefficient @xmath41 resulting from the similar parametrization of the positive quadratic and linear negative magnetoresistance as was done above : @xmath183 thus , as it is seen , for the mott case at @xmath184 @xmath185 while for the es case it is @xmath186 .",
    "note that in our calculations we assumed that the value of @xmath110 still corresponds to linear behavior of negative magnetoresistance which means that the magnetic flux through the interference area is much less than magnetic flux quantum @xmath59 .",
    "the critical field @xmath187 corresponding to a crossover from the linear behavior to saturation of the negative magnetoresistance is given as @xmath188    correspondingly , if @xmath110 given by eq.[min ] appears to be larger than @xmath187 our calculations given above are invalid and one should compare positive magnetoresistance with saturated negative magnetoresistance rather than with linear negative magnetoresistance .",
    "one notes that in contrast to linear magnetoresistance which is proportional to the area of the interference loop for the saturation magnetoresistance this proportionality is omitted . as a result ,",
    "as it was noted above , the temperature dependence of the saturation value of negative magnetoresistance @xmath159 results from factors @xmath98 for mott hopping and @xmath160 for the coulomb gap hopping .",
    "it is seen that the corresponding increase of the saturation magnetoresistance with temperature decrease is much weaker than increase of the positive magnetoresistance . then , in the case @xmath189 it is the value of @xmath187 which corresponds to minimal resistance since it separates a region of resistance decrease due to negative magnetoresistance and resistance increase due to positive magnetoresistance .",
    "however at this situation spin magnetoresistance ( [ statquadrat ] ) is also saturated so the temperature behavior of positive magnetoresistance is related to ( [ shrinkage ] ) and ( or ) to ( [ spin ] ) .    in its turn",
    "let us consider the temperature behavior of the relation between @xmath110 and @xmath187 . according to eq.[min ] and eq.[kkamimur ]",
    "@xmath190 at the same time @xmath191 for mott law and @xmath192 for es law .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath193 decreases with temperature decrease and this decrease is more pronounced for mott law .",
    "at fig.[fig1 ] we present our experimental results from ref .",
    "@xcite for 3d hopping concerning temperature behavior of magnetoresistance for regimes of coulomb gap hopping ( fig .",
    "[ fig1],a ) and of mott - type hopping ( fig .",
    "[ fig1],b ) .",
    "it is seen that these results are in in a qualitative agreement with predictions of sec.2 . in particular , the minimal value of resistance increases with temperature decrease for mott type hopping and decreases for the coulomb gap hopping . as it was noted in the introduction , the agreement was strongly improved when we had taken into account more subtle spin effects @xcite , however here we will not go into these details discussed earlier .",

    "it is seen that for the sample with smaller concentration ( fig.[fig2 ] ) the negative magnetoresistance is strongly enhanced with temperature decrease while for the sample with larger dopant concentration ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , in contrast , it is suppressed with a temperature decrease .",

    "[ fig3 ] , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    to our opinion , the difference of magnetoresistance curves for samples with different @xmath16 is related to the following fact .",

    "correspondingly , @xmath202 . as a result , the 3-cite approximation for this sample does not hold and the interference loop includes large number of scatterers . as it was noted above ,",
    "the spin statistical factor for each additional site with non - zero spin at @xmath203 for acceptor impurities is @xmath204 .",
    "correspondingly , the interference contribution for loops involving many intermediate scatterers vanishes at @xmath203 . as a result ,",
    "the linear contribution to negative magnetoresistance is , in any case , much smaller than for weakly doped samples .",
    "in contrast , the quadratic positive magneroresistance resulting from the statistical factor given by eq .",
    "[ statquadrat ] strongly increases with temperature decrease , @xmath205    in addition , we can expect that for the sample with large @xmath16 @xmath206 , thus it is @xmath187 which plays a role of @xmath110 .",
    "due to weak temperature dependence of @xmath207 the temperature behavior at the fields larger than @xmath187 , that is corresponding to the minimum of @xmath208 , is completely controlled by the spin pmr which gives @xmath209 with @xmath210 .",
    "indeed , an increase of resistance by a factor of 4 - 5 is observed at the fields larger than 0.3 t for the temperature variation from 0.9 to 0.4 k.",
    "to conclude , we have reconsidered existing theory of hopping magnetoresistance .",
    "we have shown that the random potential induced by the background impurities can affect the asymptotics of the localized states and , as a result , suppress to some extent the negative magnetoresistance related to interference effects .",
    "we have also generalized the theory for the case of acceptor states in 2d structures including the effects of the upper hubbard band .",
    "the results obtained are in agreement with existing experimental data . in particular",
    ", we explain the suppression of negative magnetoresistance with temperature decrease observed earlier for both 3d and 2d structures",
