    "although solar activity appears reasonably symmetric in the two hemispheres after short - term variations are averaged , some cycles have been known to be stronger in one hemisphere .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the asymmetries of solar cycles during the twentieth century and then to simulate these asymmetries with a solar dynamo model .",
    "the solar magnetic cycle is believed to be produced by a flux transport dynamo operating in the sun s convection zone ( wang , sheeley , and nash , 1991 ; choudhuri , schssler , and dikpati , 1995 ; durney , 1995 ; dikpati and charbonneau , 1999 ; nandy and choudhuri , 2001 , 2002 ; kker , rdiger , and schultz , 2001 ; guerrero and muoz , 2004 ) .",
    "fairly sophisticated models of the solar dynamo to explain various regular features of the solar cycle have been constructed .",
    "there is , however , not yet a convergence on the values of important parameters . in the model of chatterjee , nandy , and choudhuri ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the value of turbulent diffusivity for the poloidal field in the interior of the solar convection zone is taken to be @xmath0 @xmath1 s@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , dikpati and gilman ( 2006 ) take a value about 50 times smaller .    in order to model the hemispheric asymmetry , we need to understand how the irregularities of the solar cycle arise in the flux transport dynamo theory .",
    "we believe that the stochastic fluctuations in the dynamo process give rise to the irregularities ( choudhuri , 1992 ) .",
    "choudhuri , chatterjee , and jiang ( 2007 ) identify the babcock  leighton process of the production of poloidal field as the main source of randomness in the solar dynamo , whereas other aspects of the dynamo process are assumed to be deterministic . in the babcock ",
    "leighton process , the poloidal field is produced from the decay of tilted bipolar sunspots .",
    "the tilt of bipolar sunspots is caused by the coriolis force acting on the rising flux tubes ( dsilva and choudhuri , 1993 ) , whereas buffeting of the flux tubes by convective turbulence causes a scatter in the tilt angles around the average given by joy s law ( longcope and choudhuri , 2002 ) .",
    "because of this scatter in tilt angles , the babcock ",
    "leighton process appears not to be a deterministic process .",
    "observational data , as plotted in figure  3 of jiang , chatterjee and choudhuri ( 2007 ) , also indicate that the polar field produced at the end of a cycle is not correlated with the strength of the cycle .",
    "on the other hand , dikpati and gilman ( 2006 ) use the sunspot area data as the source function for the poloidal field , which amounts to assuming the babcock ",
    "leighton process to be fully deterministic and which is incorrect in our opinion .",
    "dikpati and gilman ( 2006 ) have predicted that the next cycle  24 will be 3050% stronger than the last cycle , which is at variance with the prediction of choudhuri , chatterjee , and jiang ( 2007 ) and jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) that it will be 3035% weaker .",
    "although the polar field produced at the end of a cycle is not correlated with the strength of the cycle , observational data show that the strength of the cycle is correlated quite well with the polar field at the preceding minimum .",
    "this is seen in figure  2 of jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , schatten et al .",
    "( 1978 ) proposed long ago that the strength of the polar field at a solar minimum can be used to predict the strength of the next cycle .",
    "svalgaard , cliver , and kamide ( 2005 ) and schatten ( 2005 ) have used the weakness of the present polar field to predict that the next cycle  24 will be weak .",
    "jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) showed that only a reasonably high value of turbulent diffusivity can give rise to the observed correlation between the polar field at the minimum and the strength of the next cycle .",
    "how this correlation arises is explained through figure  1 of jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) . if the diffusivity is high , then the poloidal field generated at the solar surface by the babcock ",
    "leighton process diffuses to the tachocline in a few years . since the next cycle is caused by the toroidal field produced from this poloidal field in the tachocline by differential rotation , it is obvious that the next cycle would appear correlated with the preceding polar field which is formed by the poleward advection of the poloidal field due to meridional circulation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the diffusivity is low , then the poloidal field produced at the surface can not diffuse to the tachocline and has to be carried to the tachocline by the meridional circulation .",
    "this takes about 20 years so that a particular cycle is not correlated with the polar field in the immediately preceding minimum .",
    "dikpati and gilman ( 2007 ) could predict a strong cycle after a minimum with a weak polar field only because they used a low diffusivity .",
    "this would never be possible in a high - diffusivity model .",
    "jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ;  5 ) provided several independent arguments why the diffusivity is likely to have the higher value which they assumed .",
    "yeates , nandy , and mackay ( 2007 ) have recently carried out a thorough study of the effects of diffusivity on a fluctuating dynamo and have confirmed the findings of jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) .",
    "if the babcock  leighton process of poloidal field generation is the source of randomness in the solar dynamo , then a theoretical model based on mean field equations has to be corrected by feeding the actual value of the observed polar field at the solar minimum ( choudhuri , chatterjee , and jiang , 2007 ) .",
    "since reliable polar field measurements are available only from mid-1970s , choudhuri , chatterjee , and jiang ( 2007 ) and jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) attempted to model only the last three solar cycles . as these last three cycles were only weakly asymmetrical between the hemispheres , they are not particularly convenient in studying the physics of hemispheric asymmetry , although jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) presented some calculations of hemispheric asymmetry .",
    "jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) pointed out two other works which provide proxies for the polar field at earlier minima : ( i ) the polar faculae numbers analyzed by sheeley ( 1991 ) ; and ( ii ) large - scale magnetic moments obtained by makarov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from the positions of dark filaments .",
    "while jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) carried out some correlation analyses based on these data , they were not used in dynamo modelling . since sheeley ( 1991 )",
    "has provided both the north and south polar faculae numbers during 19061990 , we can use this to estimate the asymmetries in the polar field during the various solar minima of the twentieth century .",
    "jiang , chatterjee , and choudhuri ( 2007 ) stressed the fact that polar fields inferred from the faculae data may not always be reliable . since it is still the best that we can do to model the asymmetries of earlier cycles , it is instructive to see what we get from this approach .    the randomness of the babcock",
    " leighton process may give rise to a stronger poloidal field in one hemisphere compared to the other .",
    "just as the polar field at the minimum gives an indication of the strength of the next cycle , we may expect that a hemispheric asymmetry in the polar field may be indicative of a hemispheric asymmetry in the solar activity during the next cycle .",
    "we find a reasonably good correlation in the observational data .",
    "the theoretical dynamo model with our assumed value of diffusivity reproduces this correlation qualitatively . in spite of a large scatter in the data",
    ", we can clearly see some interesting patterns .",
    "we present a discussion of hemispheric asymmetry seen in the observational data in  2 . then  3",
    "presents calculations from our dynamo model in which magnetic field values in the two poles during the minima are fed .",
    "the theoretical results of hemispheric asymmetry are discussed in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    ".polar faculae numbers and total sunspot areas in two hemispheres during the various cycles .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in figure  5 we plot the theoretically calculated asymmetry @xmath3 for cycle  @xmath4 against the asymmetry @xmath5 in the polar faculae number at the beginning of the cycle  @xmath4 , which is essentially the asymmetry between @xmath6 and @xmath7 values that have been fed into the code .",
    "we have to compare the theoretical figure  5 with the corresponding observational figure which is the plot for @xmath8 in figure  1 .",
    "compared to the slope 0.38 in that figure , the slope in figure  5 has a somewhat higher value of 0.60 .",
    "we consider this to be a remarkable agreement between theory and observations . as we pointed out in  2",
    ", the coupling between the hemispheres tends to reduce any asymmetry between the hemispheres .",
    "hence we find that the observed asymmetry @xmath9 of a cycle is less than the asymmetry @xmath5 of polar faculae number at the beginning of that cycle , which is an indication of the source of asymmetry in the cycle .",
    "we now find that the theoretically calculated asymmetry @xmath3 of the cycle is also reduced compared to @xmath5 at the beginning of the cycle and the reduction is by a factor which is comparable to the factor we see in the observational data .",
    "we believe that this is again an indication that parameters like diffusivity which are responsible for the coupling between the hemispheres probably have values in the correct ball park in our dynamo model .",
    "figure  6 plots theoretical asymmetry @xmath3 against the observational asymmetry @xmath9 for different cycles .",
    "the correlation coefficient of 0.73 is quite remarkable , judging by the fact that considerable uncertainties are involved in using the polar faculae number as the proxy of the polar field .",
    "during the twentieth century , some cycles had hemispheric asymmetry larger than 17% as seen in table  1 .",
    "it is possible that the hemispheric asymmetry of the solar activity plays an important role in determining the character of the solar cycle .",
    "for example , there is some observational evidence that the there was a large hemispheric asymmetry at the time of the onset of the maunder minimum ( sokoloff and nesme - ribes , 1994 ) and this asymmetry may even have played some role in inducing the maunder minimum ( charbonneau , 2005 ) .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , not much systematic effort has been made previously to study the asymmetry of solar activity with the help of dynamo models .",
    "the randomness of the babcock ",
    "leighton process can make the poloidal field in one hemisphere stronger than the other and we suggest that this induces an asymmetry in the solar cycle .",
    "we have direct poloidal field data only from mid-1970s .",
    "cycles from that time onwards have been only mildly asymmetric and hence are not particularly suitable for studying hemispheric asymmetry . also , we need a larger data set to draw any statistically significant conclusions .",
    "so we use the polar faculae number reported by sheeley ( 1991 ) as the proxy of the polar field . in spite of uncertainties involved in this procedure , we find that the asymmetry in the polar faculae number during a solar minimum is correlated with the hemispheric asymmetry of the next cycle .",
    "the correlation becomes weaker with succeeding cycles , suggesting a memory of about 1520 years .",
    "we point out that this type of correlation is possible only if we assume a relatively high value of diffusivity like @xmath0 @xmath1 s@xmath2 ( chatterjee , nandy , and choudhuri , 2004 ) .",
    "a diffusivity of this order gives the right kind of memory when the dynamo is subjected to a disturbance in the poloidal field generation ( choudhuri , chatterjee , and jiang 2007 ) .",
    "when we run our dynamo code by feeding the appropriate asymmetry at successive minima and model the sunspot cycles during the twentieth century , we get a qualitative agreement between theory and observations . we know",
    "that the cross - hemispheric coupling tries to reduce any asymmetry between the two hemispheres ( chatterjee and choudhuri , 2006 ) . both in observational data and theoretical simulations , we find that the asymmetry of a cycle statistically tends to be less than the asymmetry in the faculae number during the preceding minimum .",
    "the reduction factors also turn out to be comparable in the observational data and theoretical simulation .",
    "this is quite a remarkable agreement , given the many uncertainties involved in our analysis .",
    "solar physicists may have to wait for about half a century to be able to carry out an analysis like the present analysis based on the actual measured polar field asymmetries rather than using proxies like the polar faculae number .",
    "such an analysis will be more relevant than the present analysis , provided there will be some strongly asymmetric cycles in the next half century .",
    "we , however , hope that our methodology will provide the framework for any such future analysis .",
