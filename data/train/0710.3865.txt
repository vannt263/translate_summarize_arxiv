    "a better understanding of non - equilibrium steady states in interacting complex systems forms a critical goal of much current research in statistical physics . in this pursuit , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite has played a paradigmatic role .",
    "it provides a nontrivial , yet exactly solvable , example of phase transitions far from equilibrium , taking place even in one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattices . at the same time",
    ", it also serves as the starting point for the modeling of many physical ( driven diffusive ) processes , such as translation in protein synthesis @xcite , inhomogeneous growth processes ( e.g.  kardar - parisi - zhang growth ) @xcite and vehicular traffic @xcite .    in its simplest version ,",
    "the tasep involves a single species of particles hopping to nearest - neighbor sites , in one direction only , along a homogeneous 1d lattice .",
    "provided the destination site is empty , the rate for the particle hop is fixed at @xmath5 ( typically chosen as unity without loss of generality ) . with periodic boundary conditions , the steady - state distribution is trivial @xcite but the full dynamics is quite complex @xcite . with open boundary conditions ,",
    "particles are injected with rate @xmath6 ( in units of @xmath5 ) at one end and drained with rate @xmath7 at the other end .",
    "the competition of injection , transport and drainage induces a nontrivial phase diagram in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane @xcite , reflecting a highly nontrivial steady state .",
    "three phases are present : a maximum - current phase for @xmath8 , and a low- ( high- ) density phase for @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . not surprisingly , there are also rich dynamical aspects @xcite",
    ".    to model protein synthesis , each site on the lattice represents a codon on the messenger rna ( mrna ) , and the particles represent the ribosomes .",
    "injection , hopping , and drainage are associated respectively with initiation , elongation , and termination in biological terms .",
    "the quantity of interest , namely , the ( steady - state ) protein production rate , is identical to the ( stationary ) particle current .",
    "clearly , the simple tasep falls short of the biological system in several significant aspects .",
    "one is that an individual ribosome `` covers '' several codons @xcite , as opposed to a particle occupying only a single site .",
    "another is that , in all naturally occurring mrnas , the codons carry genetic information and therefore necessarily form an _",
    "inhomogeneous _ sequence .",
    "thus , the elongation rate of a ribosome is unlikely to be uniform ; instead , the hopping rate , @xmath13 , of a particle becomes a function of the site @xmath14 .",
    "for example , it is well known that translation slows down at specific codons ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , with potentially significant consequences for protein production rates .",
    "indeed , the steady - state current may depend sensitively on not only the _ frequency _ of each codon s occurrence , but also the _ order _ of their appearance in the sequence . both of these issues ",
    "extended objects and inhomogeneous rates  have been addressed recently in separate contexts which we summarize briefly in the following .",
    "the results associated with inhomogeneous ( quenched random ) rates fall into two broad categories , in the sense that the randomness can be associated with the particles @xcite or with the sites .",
    "randomness of the former type is more relevant for vehicular traffic where it accounts for a variety of driver preferences .",
    "in contrast , the disorder in the protein case is clearly _ site - dependent _ , leading to _ spatially _ non - uniform hopping rates @xmath15 . restricting ourselves to this class",
    ", we can consider the effect of having a whole _",
    "distribution _ , or very _ specific _ configurations , of @xmath15 .",
    "starting from given distributions , two groups @xcite studied the resulting disorder - average in periodic systems . to mention just one significant effect",
    ", the current - density diagram develops a plateau : limited by the smallest rate in the system , the current becomes independent of density over a range of densities .",
    "harris and stinchcombe @xcite also extended this work to open systems . while these studies may be of some interest to _ mixtures _ of many different mrnas , our primary interest here is to understand how the production rate of a specific protein is associated with a specific genetic sequence . as a first step towards a solution ,",
    "we adopt the approach of several other studies @xcite , by focusing on the effects of a few _ localized _ inhomogeneities , i.e. , hopping rates which are uniform _ except _ at a handful of sites @xcite . as a synthesis of these studies",
    ", we will explore in some detail the consequences of having extended objects and locating one or two slow sites at a variety of positions on the lattice . in this manner , by introducing more and more sites with a range of rates , we hope to understand inhomogeneities in a systematic way , setting the stage for further investigations of the translation process .",
    "a full comprehension of the effects of slow sites on the particle current may have potentially significant applications in biotechnology . while there are 64 distinct codons , proteins are chains composed of just 20 amino acids .",
    "so , many different mrnas ( codon sequences ) can code for the same particular protein .",
    "moreover , the amino acid is incorporated into the growing chain by an important intermediary , the so - called transfer rna ( trna ) , which carries the complementary anticodon .",
    "it turns out that the mapping between codons and trnas is also not precisely 1 - 1 .",
    "for example , in _ e.  coli _ , the genetic code actually involves 61 sense codons and about 46 trnas with associated anticodons @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for a given mrna sequence , the protein production rate is often modeled in terms of ( generally accepted ) charged - trna ( aminoacyl - trna , or aa - trna ) concentrations @xcite , so that different sequences can result in _ different _ production rates for the _ same _ protein .",
    "by elucidating how the spatial distribution of defects , especially of bottlenecks , affects translation rates , we can pinpoint those clusters of codons which are likely to have the most significant effect on the production rate of the associated protein .",
    "exploiting the degeneracy in the mapping from mrna sequence to protein , we can provide guidance as to how a few selected , local modifications of the mrna can optimize the production rate of a given protein .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we define the model and provide a more detailed description of previous work , concerning exclusion processes with extended objects or spatially inhomogeneous rates . a brief discussion of a previous mean - field analysis is also included . in section [ sec : mc ] , we present our monte carlo results .",
    "we focus especially on the implications of having extended objects by varying the particle size .",
    "we first consider the interaction between one slow site and the system boundary , and , motivated by the resulting findings , turn to the interactions between _ two _ slow sites .",
    "this provides new insights for genes containing clusters of slow codons , which occur frequently in , e.g. , _",
    "e.  coli , drosophila _ , yeast and primates @xcite . in section [ sec : mf ] , a complete investigation of systems with inhomogeneities is presented using a mean - field approach .",
    "section [ sec : sum ] contains our conclusions and a summary of open questions .",
    "the tasep is defined on a 1d lattice of @xmath16 sites .",
    "we introduce an index @xmath17 to label the sites .",
    "each site ( codon ) is either occupied by a single particle ( ribosome ) of length @xmath18 ( in units of sites ) or empty .",
    "a microscopic configuration of the system can be uniquely characterized in terms of a set of occupation variables , @xmath19 , taking the value 1(0 ) if site @xmath14 is occupied ( empty ) .",
    "of course , the extended nature of the particle induces strong correlations in @xmath19 , in the sense that a single ribosome always covers @xmath18 _ consecutive _ sites . yet , at any given time , only one of the covered codons is being `` read '' ( i.e. , the codon is `` covered by the aminoacyl site '' , or a site , of the ribosome ) and translated into an amino acid . here",
    ", we refer to the associated location on the ribosome as the `` reader '' ( of the genetic code ) . for our purposes ,",
    "it is not essential which one of the @xmath18 sites is labeled as the reader , and so we follow the convention in @xcite and choose the first ( leftmost ) site .",
    "hence , the statement `` a ribosome ( or particle ) is located at site @xmath14 '' implies that the reader is located at site @xmath14 and the subsequent @xmath20 sites are also occupied .",
    "naturally , the position of the reader determines the elongation rate , i.e. , @xmath15 , since the ribosome must wait for the arrival of the aa - trna with the @xmath14-specific anticodon before it can move to the next site .",
    "clearly , the reader locations can also be used to label a microscopic configuration , i.e. , we can define the reader occupation number at site @xmath14 as @xmath21 .",
    "the sets @xmath19 and @xmath22 are uniquely related to each other . moreover , due to the extended size of a particle , strict",
    "_ constraints _ are built in ( e.g. , @xmath23 implies @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . as a consequence",
    ", neither set can be arbitrary and serious correlations arise as soon as @xmath3 @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "we adopt a random sequential updating scheme and keep a list of locations of readers .",
    "in addition , the site @xmath26 is always occupied by a `` virtual reader , '' which accounts for particles entering the system ( initiation ) . at the beginning of each monte carlo step ( mcs ) , we first find the number of particles in the system and label it @xmath27 .",
    "then , we randomly select an entry from this list of @xmath28 readers . if the chosen reader is virtual ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) , a new particle enters the lattice with probability @xmath6 , _ provided _ all the first @xmath18 sites are empty .",
    "if the chosen reader is real , say , at site @xmath29 , the associated particle is then moved to site @xmath30 with probability @xmath15 , _ provided _",
    "site @xmath31 is empty . with this notation ,",
    "we can also write the initiation and termination probabilities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . to be complete ,",
    "the sites beyond the lattice are by definition empty , so that once a particle reaches @xmath34 , it will not experience steric hindrance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one - slow ] for a sketch of this process ) .",
    "these processes have been termed `` complete entry '' and `` incremental exit '' @xcite .",
    "other entry and exit rules can be considered , but are believed to be inconsequential provided @xmath35 .",
    "each mcs consists of @xmath28 such attempts , giving an even chance , on average , for each particle ( ribosome ) in the system to elongate or terminate , as well as for an initiation event to occur .     with ( a ) a single slow site at position @xmath36 , with rate @xmath37 , and ( b ) two slow sites with rate @xmath38 , separated by a distance @xmath39.,title=\"fig:\",width=336,height=96 ]   with ( a ) a single slow site at position @xmath36 , with rate @xmath37 , and ( b ) two slow sites with rate @xmath38 , separated by a distance @xmath39.,title=\"fig:\",width=336,height=96 ]    starting with an empty lattice ,",
    "we typically discard @xmath40 mcs to ensure that the system has reached the steady state . unless otherwise noted , good statistics result if we average over least @xmath41 measurements , separated by @xmath42 mcs in order to avoid temporal correlations .",
    "such steady state averages will be denoted by @xmath43 . to reduce the number of parameters in the model , we study systems with @xmath44 , _ except _ at one or two sites",
    ". the system sizes ( @xmath16 ) range from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , with most data taken from @xmath47 .    to characterize the state of the system",
    ", we monitor several observables .",
    "the most obvious is @xmath48 , a quantity we will refer to as the ribosome ( or reader , or particle ) density . of course , @xmath49 is just the average number of particles in the system ( i.e. , ribosomes on the mrna ) .",
    "thus , the overall particle density @xmath50 is bounded above by @xmath51 .",
    "another interesting variable @xmath52 , labeled as the `` coverage density '' , is the probability that site @xmath14 is covered by a particle ( regardless of the location of the reader ) .",
    "needless to say , the profile for the vacancies is given by the local hole density , @xmath53 .",
    "the overall coverage density , @xmath54 , may reach unity and provides a good indication of how packed the system is .",
    "the two profiles are related by @xmath55 with the understanding @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "a quantity of great importance to a biological system is the steady - state level of a given protein .",
    "if we assume that the degradation rates are ( approximately ) constant , i.e. , independent of protein concentration , then these levels are directly related to the protein production rates . in our model ,",
    "such a rate is just the average particle current @xmath58 , defined as the average number of particles exiting the system per unit time . in the steady state , it is also the current measured across any section of the lattice . for simplicity and to ensure the best statistics , we count the total number of particles which enter the lattice over the entire measurement period ( at least @xmath59 mcs in most cases ) .    in this study",
    ", we focus on two simple types of inhomogeneities : one or two `` slow '' sites ( fig .  [ fig : one - slow ] ) .",
    "their locations specify the only inhomogeneities in the rates .",
    "_ one slow site _ , at position @xmath36 .",
    "we denote @xmath60 by @xmath37 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a bottleneck in the lattice .",
    "we are especially interested in the dependence of the current , denoted by @xmath62 , on the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath36 .    _ two slow sites _",
    ", at positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 with separation @xmath65 and rates @xmath66 we find that , when @xmath67 , the current is controlled mainly by the smaller of the two , with little dependence on @xmath39 , in agreement with a simple mean - field theory to be discussed in section [ sec : mf ] . therefore , most of our attention will be devoted to the case with @xmath68 . moreover , we choose to limit our study to both sites being far from the boundaries .",
    "then , the current is insensitive to their average position @xmath69 , and we can investigate @xmath70 . note that these are precisely the systems studied in @xcite , except that we consider particles with a _ range _ of sizes : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "while there are qualitative similarities , we will discuss the _ quantitative _ differences due to @xmath3 , as well as interesting phenomena associated with the density profiles .",
    "let us now provide the context of our work by briefly reviewing some related earlier studies .",
    "the homogeneous case ( @xmath73 ) with @xmath2 is exactly soluble @xcite , and displays three phases in the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram . for @xmath3 , no exact solutions exist@xcite .",
    "analytic approximations using various mean - field approaches @xcite predict the presence of the same phases , though the phase boundaries depend on @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - ext ] ) through the combination @xcite @xmath75 monte carlo studies @xcite largely confirm these conclusions .",
    "the three phases carry different currents and display distinct density profiles @xcite . apart from `` tails '' near the boundaries , the ( coverage ) density profiles approach uniform bulk values in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , @xmath76 @xmath77 , for @xmath78 . for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ,",
    "the system is in a low - density phase ( l ) , characterized by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "a high - density phase ( h ) prevails for @xmath83 and @xmath11 , with bulk density @xmath84 and current @xmath85 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the system is in a maximum - current phase ( m ) , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 . on the @xmath89 line ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - ext ] ) , the system consists of two macroscopic regions , characterized by a low ( high ) density region near the entry ( exit ) point .",
    "the two regions are joined by a shock front that performs a random walk .",
    "this is often referred to as the `` shock phase '' ( s ) .",
    "table [ tab : j - rho ] summarizes the @xmath90 relation for tasep with extended objects .",
    "ccc & & +   + l & @xmath91/ ( 1 + @xmath92 ) & @xmath93 /(1",
    "+ @xmath92 ) + h & @xmath94/ ( 1 + @xmath95 ) & @xmath96 + m & @xmath97 & @xmath98 +    there is good agreement between simulations ( with @xmath99 ) and analytic results for these bulk quantities @xcite .",
    "the details of the profile for @xmath3 , especially near the lattice boundaries , are less well understood .",
    "while periodic structures ( of period @xmath18 ) can be expected , mean - field theories @xcite were successful in capturing only a limited part of the phenomena observed .",
    "we will return to these considerations in section [ sec : mf ] .",
    "beyond homogeneous systems , several studies introduced one or more `` impurities '' into tasep with periodic boundary condition .",
    "a single `` slow '' site induces a shock in the density profile with some interesting statistics @xcite .",
    "subsequently , generalizations to systems with a finite fraction of slow sites , randomly located , were also investigated @xcite . for the richer case of the open boundary tasep @xcite",
    ", kolomeisky focused on point particles ( @xmath2 ) , with a _",
    "single _ impurity at the _ center _ of the lattice @xcite , so as to mimic a defect situated deep in an infinitely long system .",
    "the consequences of the defect having both faster ( @xmath100 ) and slower ( @xmath0 ) rates were explored . by matching two ordinary taseps across the defect ,",
    "the properties of such systems in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane can be well described @xcite .",
    "while a fast site has no effect on the phase diagram , a slow site leads to a shift of the m - h and m - l phase boundaries to @xmath37-dependent , smaller values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the density profiles are quite sensitive to the existence of a defect site @xcite .",
    "kolomeisky s approach was generalized to the @xmath101 case in @xcite , with similar levels of success .",
    "below , we will provide further details of this work , on which we base much of the analysis of our problem . ha and den nijs also studied the @xmath2 open boundary tasep with a single defect at the center @xcite . focusing on the multicritical point @xmath102 , they were mainly interested in the so - called `` queueing transition '' and its critical properties .",
    "detailed results of density profiles , such as power law behavior and critical exponents , were obtained in the region @xmath103 .",
    "here , @xmath104 denotes the critical value of @xmath37 below which the bulk density in front of the slow site deviates from the density behind the blockage .",
    "by contrast , our focus here is essentially that of @xcite , namely , how does the _ number _ and the _ locations _ or _ spacings _ of the slow sites affect the current through the system ? in the single slow site case , @xcite investigated mainly the overall current as a function of @xmath37 , while @xcite analyzed the current as a function of @xmath36 ( the distance between the defect and the entry point ) . for the case of two defects ,",
    "both studies find that the spacing between them plays a significant role for the current .",
    "a finite - segment mean - field theory in @xcite provides excellent agreement with data .",
    "in particular , clustered defects reduce the current much more effectively than well separated ones . in this sense",
    ", we can regard these investigations as exploring the `` interactions '' between the slow site(s ) and/or the boundaries . since both studies are restricted to point particles ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "our intent is to explore the effects of having extended objects ( with @xmath99 ) .",
    "though we expect _ qualitatively _ similar behavior , as pointed out in @xcite , we also find noteworthy _ quantitative _ differences . finally , we should mention that larger numbers of defects do not lead to significantly different effects @xcite , so that we limit ourselves to one or two slow sites here .",
    "in this section , we present our monte carlo results . for convenience , we use a consistent color coding scheme ( online only ) for the various particle sizes , as specified in table [ tab : color ] .",
    ".color coding scheme [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the data here consist of the overall currents and the density profiles of both coverage and ribosomes .",
    "our focus will be how these quantities depend on @xmath37 , @xmath36 ( for the case with a single defect ) , and @xmath39 ( for the case with two defects ) .",
    "although the profiles are difficult to extract experimentally , the reader profiles will be of interest in subsequent studies involving real gene sequences , since they provide information on how frequently a particular trna is bound to the mrna .",
    "by contrast , the currents are easily measurable and our results here may generate more immediate interest .",
    "we begin by placing one slow site on the lattice as in fig .",

    "[ fig : one - profile ] shows several coverage density profiles for a typical choice of parameters : @xmath47 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "as expected , we observe pile - ups of particles due to the blockage  a high ( low ) density region before ( after ) the bottleneck in all three cases . however , due to the lack of ordinary particle - hole symmetry in the @xmath3 cases , the average densities on either side of the slow site are not symmetric around @xmath108 .",
    "instead , they are _ roughly _ related through the @xmath58-@xmath77 relations in the h and l phases , summarized in table [ tab : j - rho ] . in detail , the profiles are quite different : the `` tails '' , i.e. , the deviations from the bulk values , are quite noticeable in the vicinity of both the slow site and the edges of the system for the @xmath109 cases .",

    "these findings are entirely consistent with similar studies in the past , most of which were restricted to @xmath2 @xcite . if the inhomogeneities are deep in the bulk and far from each other , the current depends only on @xmath37 and can be understood through simple mean - field considerations . through the current - density relationship ( for an infinite homogeneous tasep ) , the overall densities in each of the defect - free sections can be also predicted , so that the various `` phases '' of these subsystems can be understood .",

    "work is in progress to investigate these approaches systematically .    beyond one or two blockages",
    ", we should study systems with multiple slow sites , as our eventual goal is to understand the properties of fully inhomogeneous taseps .",
    "in particular , though restricted to just one or two slow sites , our findings - that the relative locations of blockages are important - will have implications for translation . for example , they are directly applicable to `` designer genes '' , which consist of many repeats of the same codon , except at one or two locations . using the abundance of associated aa - trnas as a control for the elongation rate across any particular codon , we can test our results directly on such genes .",
    "thus , it will be interesting to see the physical manifestation of , e.g. , enhancement and suppression of production rates of such artificial proteins , depending on the placement of the slow codon(s ) .",
    "similarly , reproducing the intriguing ribosome density profiles will be revealing .",
    "more important than `` designer genes , '' we should consider the implications for real genes .",
    "our results should provide , at the least , some simple qualitative insights .",
    "we can obviously maximize the production rate of a particular protein associated with a certain real gene by systematically replacing all slow codons with synonymous , faster ones .",
    "however , for most genes this operation will require a large number of replacements . instead , with our findings in mind , we can achieve considerable increases in the production rates by making only a few substitutions , namely , by replacing the slowest codons , or a cluster of nearby slow codons .",
    "the ratio of current enhancement to the number of codon replacements may be used to quantify how `` optimal '' a certain set of substitutions is .",
    "this idea can be applied to finding optimal means to _ suppress _ prodcution rates as well .",
    "simulation work with taseps associated with real genes is in progress and we hope to demonstrate that these concepts are viable .",

    "however , in translation , a ribosome `` at site @xmath14 '' can move to the next site only when the trna associated with site @xmath14 arrives .",
    "therefore , it is natural to associate the jump rate with a site , and so we will use terms like `` slow site '' and `` slow bond '' interchangeably . with protein synthesis in mind , we also use the phrase `` slow codon . ''          for tasep on a ring ,",
    "the total number of particles and holes are both conserved . if the hopping rates are _ uniform _ , it is possible to specify microscopic configurations in such a way that _ no _ such correlations are explicitly present , namely , the set of integers @xmath289 , where @xmath290 denotes the number of holes between the @xmath291 and @xmath292 particles .",
