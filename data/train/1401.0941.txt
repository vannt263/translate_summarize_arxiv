    "after a common envelope ( ce )  phase ( stage  2 ) where the extended envelope of the primary engulfed the other two stars ( initially only embedding the secondary star ; later also partly the tertiary star ) , the orbital period of the inner system was @xmath37 and the orbital period of the outer star was @xmath38 . following a second mass transfer ( case  bb , stage  3 ) and a supernova ( sn )  explosion ( stage  4 ) they became @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which after orbital circularization ( before stage  6 ) became @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "the last set of values were the orbital periods at the onset of the first ( outer ) low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb )  phase , which ended with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , before the second ( inner ) lmxb  phase left the system with its present observed properties .",
    "we now describe in more detail the physical properties of our model .      a close triple system like psr  j0337 + 1715  with one neutron star ( ns ) and two wds requires two lmxb  phases .",
    "although psr  j0337 + 1715  was substantially less hierarchical earlier in its evolution , the system seems to have evolved through both of its lmxb  phases , in  effect , mainly via binary interactions , with only small dynamical perturbations from the second or third star .",
    "the important piece of evidence for this comes from the masses and orbital periods of the wds which fall exactly as predicted by the @xmath44 relation for lmxb evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the match between this theoretical relation and the observational data for psr  j0337 + 1715  is excellent .",

    "these helium  wds are companions to pulsars or found in binaries with a - type main sequence stars .",
    "the eccentricities of both orbits are , although small , one to two orders of magnitude larger than expected theoretically for isolated binaries with similar components and orbital periods @xcite .",
    "although this may be a result of mutual triple interactions , a few binary pulsars with wd companions in the galactic field have similar eccentricities ( see figure  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the two wds orbiting psr  j0337 + 1715  are the remnants of two lmxb  phases .",
    "optical observations by @xcite show that the inner wd is quite hot ( @xmath46 ) , whereas the outer wd is too cold to be detected .",
    "therefore , we assume in the following that the inner wd formed last ( see section  [ subsec : alternative ] for a discussion ) .",
    "we can deduce that both lmxb  phases evolved highly non - conservatively since the low msp mass of @xmath4 implies that it can not have accreted much material ( at most @xmath47 in total ; in our model we assume a ns birth mass of @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the presently observed ( post - lmxb ) orbital period of the inner binary , @xmath8 is close to the so - called bifurcation period ( between 1 and  2  days , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , below which magnetic braking is dominant in lmxbs @xcite and above which the widening of the orbit is significant , we also conclude that the pre - lmxb ( post - sn ) orbital period of the inner binary must have been close to this value .    for the preceding outer lmxb  phase",
    "there is further evidence for highly non - conservative evolution since the mass - transfer rate must have been super - eddington for such a wide system ( initially @xmath41 ) where the donor star had a deep convective envelope at the onset of the roche - lobe overflow ( rlo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the rapid outer lmxb  phase , we expect the pulsar only to be mildly recycled  possibly with a spin period between 25  ms and 1  sec .",
    "( a typical value for pulsars with a wd and @xmath49 , * ? ? ?",
    "effective recycling of the msp was obtained in the subsequent long - lasting inner lmxb  phase .",
    "the masses of the two wd progenitor stars are constrained , on the one hand , by requirements of the development of a degenerate helium core _ and _ dynamically stable mass transfer ( @xmath50 ) and , on the other hand , by nuclear evolution and wd cooling within a hubble time ( @xmath51 ) . the estimated component masses before / after the mass transfer then yield the amount of mass lost from the system .",
    "the changes of the orbital separations as a result of lmxb mass transfer / loss can be found by solving the orbital angular momentum balance equation within the isotropic re - emission model @xcite , but with some modification .",
    "for example , we can not assume a pure fast ( jeans mode ) wind mass loss from the inner binary with respect to the tertiary star during the inner lmxb  phase ( stage  8) .",
    "some of the inner binary material might be lost in a rather slow wind which only causes a moderate widening ( if any ) of @xmath27 during this phase .",
    "nevertheless , following the outer lmxb  phase ( stage  6 ) , @xmath27 could have been smaller than observed today ( 327  days ) . in the most extreme case ( jeans mode )",
    "it could be as short as 175  days , given that the semi - major axis of the outer orbit in this case changes according to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the total mass of the triple system and the indices @xmath54 and @xmath55 refer to initial and final values , respectively .",
    "here we assume a more moderate value of 250  days .",
    "the major uncertainties in our modelling are related to i ) spin - orbit couplings mediated by tidal torques ( e.g. magnetic braking ) and ii ) accretion onto the inner binary system during mass transfer from the tertiary star ( stage  6 ) , and the poorly known specific orbital angular momentum of the ejected mass .",
    "presumably , an inner circumbinary disk @xcite will be formed which may subsequently influence the evolution of the inner orbit . however , investigating the dynamical effects of the sn explosion helps to constrain the properties of the pre - lmxb systems .",
    "a general discussion of dynamical effects of asymmetric sne in hierarchical multiple star systems is found in @xcite , and references therein .",
    "here we have simulated the dynamical effects of the sn explosion that created the ns in the psr  j0337 + 1715  system . in figure",
    "[ fig : kick ] we have plotted the survival probability of our best model for the triple system as a function of the recoil velocity immediately imparted to the inner system ( i.e. the `` inner binary kick '' , @xmath56 ) as a consequence of the sn .",
    "all relevant pre - sn parameters are stated in the figure ( see also table  [ table : stages ] , stage  4 ) . along",
    "the plotted curves are examples of average values of @xmath57 for kick velocities between @xmath58 and @xmath59 which were imparted to the newborn ns . for estimating the resulting values of @xmath57 we only considered systems which survived the sn in long - term stable orbits ( section  [ subsec : stability ] ) , and for which the inner binary avoided merging necessary for forming psr  j0337 + 1715 .",
    "if including this specific constraint , the probabilities shown would be much lower . ] .    given the constraints on the post - sn evolution to meet the requirements for psr  j0337 + 1715 , we find that it may even have survived a ns kick up to @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting peculiar velocities of the triple system range between @xmath61 and @xmath1 .",
    "the triple system is much more likely to survive the explosion if the pre - collapsing core mass is low .",
    "a pre - sn core mass of only @xmath62 is indeed expected if the progenitor star ( say , @xmath63 ) lost its hydrogen - rich envelope on the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , because the resulting naked helium core itself ( @xmath64 ) would expand and give rise to case  bb rlo @xcite , leaving an even further stripped pre - sn core during stage  3 . in case the ns progenitor did not lose its envelope until the asymptotic giant branch , the collapsing core mass could have been much larger . however , we find that a collapsing core mass of , for example , @xmath65 decreases the survival probability considerably and leaves the triple system with @xmath66 .",
    "the outcome of the ce evolution is crucial for determining the pre - sn core mass and orbital periods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus for the survival probability of the triple system .",
    "unfortunately , ce evolution is the least understood of the important interactions in close binary systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) . for close triple systems , understanding the ce evolution",
    "is an even more complicated task .",
    "however , the existence of psr  j0337 + 1715  provides an important piece of information : namely that ce evolution ( stage  2 ) not only leads to efficient orbital angular momentum loss of the inner binary orbit , also the tertiary star is subject to efficient in - spiral .",
    "the evidence for this conclusion is the following . on the one hand , the orbital period of the tertiary star could not be very large at the moment of the sn .",
    "there are two reasons for this : i ) the post - sn @xmath27 ( after recircularization ) must match the expected orbital period at the onset of the outer lmxb  phase , and ii ) to avoid a very small survival probability as a consequence of the sn . on the other hand ,",
    "the system must have had @xmath67 on the zams .",
    "the evidence for this is that the ratio of the orbital periods ( @xmath68 ) on the zams must have been at least a factor of @xmath69 , and even larger for non - circular orbits , in order for the triple system to remain dynamically stable on a long timescale ( see section  [ subsec : stability ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the onset of the ce could not have happened much earlier than near the tip of the rgb of the primary star , which corresponds to @xmath70 .",
    "the reason is that the binding energy of the hydrogen - rich envelope is simply too high to allow for ejection at earlier stages @xcite .",
    "this constraint , in combination with the stability criteria of the triple system , sets the lower limit of @xmath71 on the zams .",
    "hence , we conclude that an efficient in - spiral of the tertiary star , and thus _ both _ of the outer stars , must have taken place .",
    "@xcite argued for a similar conclusion based on the tertiary f - dwarf orbiting the lmxb 4u  2129 + 47 ( v1727  cyg ) .",
    "as also pointed out by these authors , the sn explosion itself could also have decreased the orbital period of the tertiary star of the surviving triple system . in that case , the need for ce in - spiral is less extreme , but still highly demanded . from our simulations , we find that the pre - sn orbital period of the tertiary could have been up to about 120  days ; still much shorter than the zams @xmath27 of about 4000  days .",
    "throughout our scenario , we have checked at each evolutionary stage that the mutual orbits of our solutions are expected to have a long - term dynamical stability .",
    "a number of stability criteria for triple systems have been proposed over the last four decades ( see * ? ? ? * for an overview ) . to be extra cautious and conservative",
    ", we only accepted our found solutions in case they fulfilled all criteria suggested by @xcite .",
    "the post - sn stages outlined here for the formation of psr  j0337 + 1715  differ somewhat from those proposed for psr  j1903 + 0327 @xcite .",
    "the latter system most likely became dynamically unstable during a diverging lmxb evolution of the inner binary , as a result of the @xmath30ratio decreasing below the critical limit ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) when the inner orbit expanded .",
    "this instability was possibly aided by cyclic perturbations of the inner binary by the unevolved tertiary star @xcite while the critical orbital separation was approached .",
    "hence , the j1903 + 0327 system may correspond to a disrupted case of an evolution which could otherwise have resulted in a triple msp system .      despite its cold temperature ,",
    "it can not be excluded entirely that the outer wd formed last .",
    "the reason for this is that some low - mass helium wds take @xmath72 to reach the wd cooling track after detaching from their roche  lobe ( a.  istrate  et  al .",
    ", in  preparation ) .",
    "residual shell hydrogen burning can not be ignored in these stars and keeps them hot on a long timescale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the duration of the outer lmxb  phase is much shorter than that of the inner lmxb  phase ( @xmath13 versus @xmath73 , respectively , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and given that a @xmath74 helium wd does not experience residual hydrogen burning and therefore cools faster , it seems conceivable to form the outer wd _",
    "after _ the formation of the inner wd .",
    "even a double lmxb  phase is possible , depending on how close in mass the two wd progenitor stars were , or if the secondary star was forced into rlo during mass - transfer from the tertiary star .",
    "@xcite recently presented a novel attempt to simulate the combined stellar evolution , gravitational dynamics , and hydrodynamical interactions of a triple system .",
    "although it is too early to draw firm conclusion from such a study , it is interesting to notice that their finding of significant loss of orbital angular momentum in the inner binary during the rlo from the tertiary star would strengthen the possibility of a double lmxb  phase .",
    "what are the alternative scenarios to the one presented here for producing psr  j0337 + 1715 ?",
    "a scenario with a massive star ( @xmath21 ) orbited by a distant binary of low - mass stars ( @xmath75 ) might be dynamically unstable during the ce  stage .",
    "instead , psr  j0337 + 1715  may possibly have formed in a quadruple system where the sn kick caused interactions with an outer binary and ejection of the fourth member .",
    "the present triple system might also have evolved in a globular cluster and subsequently ejected into the galactic field , for example , in a binary - binary encounter event .",
    "however , it is questionable if the triple system would survive such an ejection process .",
    "in addition , this scenario seems difficult to reconcile with the low eccentricities of psr  j0337 + 1715and the fine match with the @xmath44 relation .    finally , to obtain a small kick , one may advocate for the formation of the ns via accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of a wd @xcite .",
    "however , according to a recent study on aic @xcite , the required donor star masses are considerably larger ( @xmath76 , depending on metallicity ) than what is constrained here for @xmath23 .",
    "we have presented a first self - consistent , semi - analytical solution to the formation of psr  j0337 + 1715  which constrains the peculiar velocity of the system to be less than @xmath1 and which requires double in - spiral during the common envelope evolution in a close triple system .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainties of our initial masses of all three stars are about 20@xmath77% .",
    "we have briefly discussed a number of alternative models for which further calculations are needed . to probe the full parameter space with weighted probabilities for forming psr  j0337 + 1715  ( depending on the pre - sn core mass , ce physics , orbital angular momentum losses , dynamical stability , geometry preferences for the mutual orbits , a possible quadruple origin , etc . ) would require a full population synthesis investigation which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "psr  j0337 + 1715  is a unique example of a triple system which has survived _ three _ phases of rlo .",
    "the outcome of the two lmxb mass - transfer phases matches nicely with the theoretical expectations from the @xmath44 relation of wds .",
    "the possibility of two rlo events in a triple system was first discussed by @xcite only two decades ago .",
    "these authors denoted such systems as doubly interesting triples .",
    "psr  j0337 + 1715  has not only managed to experience _",
    "three _ phases of rlo , it has also survived a sn explosion to evolve towards its present terminal stage containing three compact objects  a truly remarkable journey for a triple system .",
    "our analysis of the formation of this system only allows for a plausible solution when current knowledge of stellar evolution and interactions is stretched to the limit .",
    "the existence of this system in the galactic field has opened a new door to stellar astrophysics with resulting challenges to be met in the years to come ."
