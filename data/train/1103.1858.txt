    "the geometry of the moduli space @xmath1 of principally polarized abelian varieties ( ppav ) of dimension @xmath2 has been studied extensively since the works of riemann and jacobi .",
    "still , the structure of the cohomology and chow rings of @xmath1 and its various compactifications remains to a large extent unknown .",
    "much of the recent progress in this direction ( and similarly for the moduli of curves @xmath3 ) originated from the idea of studying the tautological subrings of chow and cohomology .",
    "in particular , the tautological ring of @xmath1 is the ring generated by the chern classes of the hodge vector bundle , and mumford @xcite was perhaps the first to discuss the relations in the tautological ring .",
    "later van der geer in @xcite and esnault and viehweg in @xcite described the tautological ring of @xmath1 , and of a suitable toroidal compactification ( in the cohomology and in the chow ring , respectively ) , by proving that the fundamental relation gives all the relations .",
    "this fundamental relation is at the heart of many calculations in the chow ring , and we dedicate this paper to the memory of eckart viehweg .    while the tautological ring has been described , it is not clear what the non - tautological classes in chow and cohomology are . moreover , for naturally defined geometric subvarieties of @xmath1 it is not clear if their classes are tautological .",
    "studying geometrically defined subvarieties of @xmath1 could thus shed some further light on the geometry of the space , and this is the subject we pursue here .",
    "some of the first examples of such subvarieties are the andreotti - mayer loci @xmath4 .",
    "these are the loci of ppav whose theta divisor is singular in dimension at least @xmath5 : @xmath6 these loci were defined in @xcite as a tool for approaching the schottky problem  the question of characterizing jacobians of curves among all ppav . to this end andreotti and",
    "mayer proved that the locus of jacobians is an irreducible component of @xmath7 , and the locus of hyperelliptic jacobians  of @xmath8 .",
    "beauville @xcite showed that @xmath9 is a divisor , debarre @xcite showed that for @xmath10 the divisor @xmath9 has two irreducible components ( one of them the theta - null divisor ) , and mumford @xcite showed that the codimension of @xmath11 is at least 2 . in another direction , ein and lazarsfeld",
    "@xcite proved the conjecture of arbarello and de concini @xcite stating that @xmath12 is equal to the locus of decomposable ppav ( those that are products of lower - dimensional ppav ) .",
    "in general not much is known about the number of components of the andreotti - mayer loci , their dimension , or their class in the chow ring .",
    "the study of these loci was recently advanced by ciliberto and van der geer , who showed in @xcite that for @xmath13 the codimension of ( any component of ) @xmath4 is at least @xmath14 ( and if @xmath15 , at least @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the best bound possible , and they conjecture in @xcite that any component of @xmath4 whose general point corresponds to an abelian variety with endomorphism ring @xmath17 has codimension at least @xmath18 .",
    "they moreover conjecture that equality only occurs for @xmath19 and the hyperelliptic locus , respectively @xmath20 and the jacobi locus .",
    "this conjecture remains wide open for @xmath21 , and only the case of @xmath22 was fully settled by ciliberto and van der geer in @xcite .",
    "this means that ciliberto and van der geer prove that the codimension of @xmath11 is at least 3 , this being the first improvement in this direction since the work of mumford .",
    "the method of their proof is by considering the closure of the locus @xmath11 in a suitable toroidal compactification of @xmath1 , and studying all degenerations of torus rank up to 2 ( we shall discuss this notion in detail below in section [ sec : outline ] ) .",
    "it appears that our methods and results on semiabelic varieties of torus rank up to 3 should allow for an extension of their method deeper into the boundary , and in particular would allow one to handle _ any _ subvariety of @xmath1 of codimension at most 5 , by studying its intersection with the boundary of a toroidal compactification . in particular",
    ", we believe our results , together with a suitable interpretation of the results of @xcite , should give an approach to the andreotti - mayer locus @xmath23 .",
    "while the conjecture of ciliberto and van der geer is that the codimension of @xmath23 is at least 6 , our results on semiabelic theta divisors should suffice ( once the appropriate generalization of ( * ? ? ?",
    "12.1 ) for other degenerations is obtained  we will remark on this below ) to prove the following weaker statement , which would still be an improvement of the known bound of 4 for the codimension :    [ theo : n2 ] the codimension in @xmath1 of any component of the locus @xmath23 consisting of simple abelian varieties is at least 5 .",
    "another interesting subvariety of @xmath1 is the locus @xmath24 parameterizing principally polarized abelian varieties whose theta divisor has a singularity at an odd @xmath25-torsion point .",
    "casalaina - martin and friedman @xcite showed that @xmath26 is equal , within the locus of indecomposable ppav , to the locus of intermediate jacobians of cubic threefolds .",
    "moreover , casalaina - martin and laza @xcite studied the closure of @xmath26 , in particular describing the corresponding decomposable ppavs . for arbitrary @xmath2 the loci @xmath24 ( and generalizations ) were investigated in @xcite ; conjecture 1 in that paper states that @xmath24 , if non - empty , has pure codimension @xmath2 in @xmath1 .",
    "the main result of this paper is a new proof by degeneration methods of this conjecture for @xmath27 :    [ theo : ig ] the locus @xmath24 is empty for @xmath28 and has pure codimension @xmath2 in @xmath1 for @xmath29 .",
    "this result is not new ; it follows from the work of casalaina - martin and friedman @xcite characterizing @xmath26 .",
    "however , their results were obtained using the theory of prym varieties , and our methods are completely different .",
    "our next result is what we need for computing the class of the locus of intermediate jacobians in @xcite .",
    "to explain its statement , we need to discuss the compactifications of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the main idea of the proof of the theorems above is to study and understand the closures @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the loci @xmath23 and @xmath24 in a suitable ( toroidal ) compactification of @xmath1 .",
    "there are two toroidal compactifications which are of interest to us : the perfect cone compactification @xmath32 and the second voronoi cone compactification @xmath33 .",
    "both are toroidal compactifications , i.e.  are given by a suitable fan ( or rational polyhedral decomposition ) in the rational closure of the cone of real semi - positive @xmath34 matrices , namely the perfect cone and the second voronoi decomposition respectively .",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath33 have an intrinsic geometric meaning : the first is the minimal model of @xmath1 for @xmath35 , in the sense of the minimal model program ( this was proven by shepherd - barron @xcite ) , the latter represents ( at least up to normalization and up to extra components ) a geometrically meaningful functor , namely that of stable polarized semi - abelic varieties ( this was proven by alexeev @xcite ) . for @xmath36 , but not in general , @xmath33 is a blow - up of @xmath32 .",
    "analytically , the locus @xmath24 can be described as the zero locus of the gradients @xmath37 of the theta function at odd two - torsion points @xmath38 ( see next section for a precise definition ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath37 extend to sections @xmath39 of some vector bundle on ( a level cover of ) @xmath32 .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the ( projection to @xmath32 from a level cover of the ) zero locus of @xmath41 .",
    "we then have the obvious inclusion @xmath42 , as @xmath40 is the zero locus of some holomorphic functions vanishing identically on @xmath24 ( and thus also on @xmath31 ) .",
    "we note that since locally @xmath24 is given by the vanishing of each of the @xmath2 components of the gradient vector @xmath37 , the codimension of any component of @xmath24 in @xmath1 is at most equal to @xmath2",
    ". the following result will be crucial in our forthcoming paper @xcite , where it will be used to compute the classes of the loci @xmath31 in the chow rings of @xmath32 for @xmath27 .",
    "[ theo : gg ] the locus @xmath43 has no irreducible components contained in @xmath44 of codimension less than 6 in @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath27 , we have @xmath45 .    to see that the first statement of the theorem implies the second , note that for @xmath27 the locus @xmath40",
    ", being of codimension at most @xmath46 , has no irreducible components contained in the boundary , and thus any of its irreducible components is a closure of a component of @xmath24 .",
    "besides these main theorems , the core of the paper ( and of the proofs for all of the above ) is an explicit description of the geometry of various types of semi - abelic varieties  which is really our main result .",
    "we are essentially able to extend the degeneration computations originated by mumford for the partial compactification two steps further into the boundary .    in order to study the closures of the subvarieties @xmath4 and @xmath24 in @xmath32 or @xmath33 it",
    "is necessary to understand the geometry of the semi - abelic varieties and their ( semi - abelic polarization ) theta divisors , associated to boundary points of @xmath33 .",
    "recall that every toroidal compactification of @xmath1 maps to the satake compactification @xmath47 we denote the projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we denote @xmath50 the open strata of the perfect cone compactification , and denote by @xmath51 the closed strata .",
    "we say that a semi - abelic variety has torus rank @xmath5 if the corresponding point of @xmath32 lies in @xmath52 ( resp .  for @xmath33 , lies in @xmath53 )    since the second voronoi and the perfect cone decomposition coincide up to genus @xmath0 it follows in particular that @xmath54 .",
    "in fact more is true as we shall discuss in section [ sec : outline ] : the two compactifications coincide outside codimension at least @xmath55 in @xmath32 .",
    "we shall make use of this fact .",
    "one of the results of this paper is a complete description of the geometry of semi - abelic varieties of torus rank at most @xmath0 and their theta divisors , describing explicitly their geometry , including the geometry of the polarization divisor .",
    "one of the main applications of this description is to computing the class of the closure of the locus @xmath24 in the chow ring of @xmath32 , which we will accomplish in a forthcoming paper @xcite . for this reason",
    "we also describe explicitly the involutions on the semi - abelic varieties , their fixed points , and the gradients of the ( semi - abelic ) theta function at these fixed points .",
    "we shall derive these descriptions from toric geometry together with some simple properties of the ( symmetric ) theta divisor which follow from general principles .",
    "alternatively one can also make alexeev s construction explicit .",
    "we chose the geometric approach as the more elementary method , as this gives us the geometric properties which we require .",
    "we would like to thank gerard van der geer for describing the problem to us , and for discussing his work on the subject .",
    "we are grateful to valery alexeev for discussions and explanations regarding degenerations of abelian varieties and their polarizations .",
    "we are greatly indebted to frank vallentin , who has patiently answered our numerous questions on cone decompositions .",
    "finally we thank niko behrens for producing the pictures used in this paper .",
    "the first author thanks leibniz universitt hannover for hospitality during his visits there when some of this work was done .",
    "we denote by @xmath56 the siegel upper half plane of genus @xmath2 and consider the quotient @xmath57  the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties ( ppav ) .",
    "the riemann theta function @xmath58 is a function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 and is given by @xmath61 where for future use we denote @xmath62 the exponential function .",
    "the theta function is quasiperiodic and satisfies @xmath63 for any @xmath64 .    for an abelian variety @xmath65 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath66 $ ] the set of two - torsion points on it ; as a group , @xmath66\\cong ( { { \\mathbb{z}}}/2{{\\mathbb{z}}})^{2g}$ ] .",
    "analytically the points in @xmath66 $ ] can be labeled @xmath67 , for @xmath68 being the period matrix of @xmath65 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we denote @xmath70 and call it the _ parity _ of @xmath38 . accordingly we call @xmath38 even or odd depending on whether @xmath71 is @xmath72 or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to the point @xmath38 not lying ( resp .  lying ) on the theta divisor for a generic @xmath68 (",
    "i.e.  for a two - torsion point @xmath38 the function @xmath74 is identically zero if and only if @xmath38 is odd ) .    for a point @xmath67",
    "we denote the theta function with ( half - integer ) characteristic @xmath75}(\\tau , z):=\\theta_m(\\tau , z):=\\ ] ] @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 , the theta function with characteristic is even or odd depending on the parity of the characteristic . in particular , all odd theta constants with characteristics ( the values of theta functions with characteristics at @xmath78 ) vanish identically .",
    "we recall the level subgroups of @xmath79 defined as follows : @xmath80 @xmath81 the moduli space of ppav is then @xmath82 , while the level moduli spaces @xmath83 and @xmath84 are finite covers of @xmath1 .",
    "we can thus compute for an odd point @xmath85 $ ] @xmath86}(\\tau , z)|_{z=0 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath87}(\\tau,0)=0 $ ] for an odd two - torsion point @xmath38 .",
    "it is known that this gradient is a vector - valued modular form for @xmath88 for the representation @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the hodge vector bundle on @xmath1 .",
    "note that this bundle extends to any toroidal compactification of @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath92 acts on the gradients by certain signs , and thus the zero locus @xmath93 is a well - defined subvariety of @xmath94 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the properties of the gradients of the theta function and further questions on loci of ppavs with points of high multiplicity on the theta divisor .",
    "finally we denote by @xmath95 the locus of ppavs for which _ some _ @xmath37 vanishes  note that it follows from the fact that @xmath96 permutes the @xmath37 that the projection of @xmath97 to @xmath1 does not depend on @xmath38 . for further use",
    "we also denote by @xmath98 the closure in the perfect cone compactification .",
    "the sections @xmath37 extend to sections of a suitable vector bundle on the perfect cone decomposition @xmath32 .",
    "this is most easily described on the level @xmath99 cover @xmath100 .",
    "we shall denote the boundary components of this compactification by @xmath101 . recall that these are enumerated by the index @xmath102 we denote the mod @xmath25 reduction of @xmath103 by @xmath104 .",
    "moreover we call an element @xmath105 _ even _ or _ odd _ if the product of the length @xmath2 vectors @xmath106 is even or odd respectively . in @xcite",
    "we show the following result :    [ prop : extension ] the sections @xmath37 extend to global sections @xmath107 which do not vanish at a general point of any irreducible component of the boundary divisor .",
    "this follows from a computation of the fourier expansion of the sections @xmath37 . for details",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) and also the computations in @xcite .",
    "note that the statement of the above proposition includes the claim that @xmath108 is a cartier divisor , not just a weil divisor , which is not immediate as @xmath100 is not a smooth variety for @xmath109 .",
    "however this was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) , and also follows from the computations in @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath110 the vanishing locus of @xmath41 .",
    "we note that by this definition we automatically have @xmath111 , and thus if we show that @xmath41 does not vanish in codimension less than @xmath2 for @xmath27 , this would suffice to prove theorem [ theo : ig ] .",
    "throughout the paper we shall make extensive use of the description of @xmath33 as ( the normalization of ) a moduli space of polarized semi - abelic varieties .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite,@xcite , @xcite where details can be found .",
    "here we shall recall the facts which we will require for our purposes and outline the approach which we shall take .",
    "recall that alexeev @xcite showed that ( possibly up to normalization ) the voronoi compactification @xmath33 represents a functor .",
    "the geometric objects are pairs @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a stable semi - abelic variety ( in particular it admits an action of a semi - abelian variety ) and @xmath114 is a theta divisor ( for a precise definition see ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1.9 ) ) . for smooth objects the functors of principally polarized abelian varieties and that of stable polarized semi - abelic varieties are isomorphic :",
    "an abelian variety is a torsor over itself and @xmath115 is just the classical theta divisor ( which is unique up to translation ) .",
    "the boundary strata of any toroidal compactification correspond to orbits of cones in the corresponding rational polyhedral cone decomposition ( fan ) . to every such orbit",
    "corresponds a type of polarized semi - abelic varieties .",
    "if the relative interior of a given cone contains symmetric matrices of rank @xmath5 , then the corresponding semi - abelic varieties have torus rank @xmath5 , i.e.  the normalization of the semi - abelic variety is fibered over an abelian variety @xmath116 of dimension @xmath117 .",
    "the semi - abelic variety will in general have several components , each fibering over @xmath116 with fibers being toric varieties of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the precise nature of these components , as well as the combinatorics of their gluings , is determined by a periodic decomposition of @xmath118 into polytopes , determined by the cone in question , which is invariant under the action of @xmath119 . in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    "the general theory of degeneration data is described , from which it is also possible to obtain the description of the theta divisor .",
    "in particular , valery alexeev explained to us how to easily derive the formulae for the theta divisor of standard semi - abelic varieties ( see below for a definition ) directly from this general framework .",
    "note , however , that in this general approach the calculations dealing with reducible semi - abelic varieties with non - trivial abelian part are already quite complicated , while our approach is direct and sufficient for our purposes here , and also provides an explicit and direct confirmation of the general framework .",
    "we also compute the involution and study its fixed points explicitly .",
    "in this paper we are mostly interested in the perfect cone decomposition @xmath32 .",
    "the perfect cone decomposition and the second voronoi decomposition coincide in genus @xmath120 . for @xmath121",
    "the second voronoi decomposition is a refinement of the perfect cone decomposition @xcite , @xcite , i.e.  @xmath33 is a blow - up of @xmath32 for these genera . for @xmath122",
    "the situation is very simple : @xmath123 is the blow - up of @xmath124 in one point .",
    "this corresponds to a subdivision of a non - basic @xmath125-dimensional cone , the so - called second perfect cone . in @xmath126",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "for @xmath127 we let @xmath128 be the center of the modification @xmath129 . then @xmath130 for @xmath120 and @xmath131 is a point .",
    "we shall use the fact that the codimension of @xmath132 in @xmath32 is greater than @xmath46 . to see this",
    "it is enough to consider the part of @xmath32 which lies over @xmath133 as the complement of this set in @xmath32 has codimension @xmath55 . in other words",
    "we must consider all those cones in the perfect cone decomposition which are not also cones in the second voronoi decomposition .",
    "there are no such cones for @xmath120 .",
    "we already mentioned that there is precisely one such cone for @xmath122 and this is in codimension @xmath125 .",
    "finally there is only one stratum in @xmath32 over @xmath134 of codimension @xmath46 and this is the stratum belonging to the cone @xmath135 . but this cone is a face of the so - called principal cone and is thus also contained in the second voronoi decomposition .",
    "a partial compactification @xmath136 can be constructed by adding all those strata to @xmath1 which correspond to cones belonging to both the perfect cone and the second voronoi decomposition .",
    "below we list all cones which correspond to strata of codimension @xmath137 in @xmath32 .",
    "all of these cones belong to both the perfect cone and the second voronoi decomposition .",
    "these are the strata which we will have to handle .    to explain the geometric situation which we will encounter we start with the simplest case of semi - abelic varieties , the so - called _ standard degenerations_. we shall treat these in detail in the next section .",
    "the starting point for such a standard degeneration is the decomposition of @xmath118 into unit cubes . in this case",
    "the normalization of the semi - abelic varieties is irreducible , and is a fibration over some @xmath138 with fibers isomorphic to @xmath139 , the toric variety corresponding to a @xmath5-dimensional cube ( we refer to @xcite for a description of the toric variety associated to a polytope ) .",
    "all other decompositions which we shall have to consider are subdivisions of these cubes .",
    "the action of @xmath119 by translations on the periodic decomposition of @xmath118 into polytopes also tells us how to _ glue _ the normalization to get the semi - abelic variety ( i.e.  what identifications have to be made to obtain the semi - abelic variety from its normalization ) . in the case of the cube",
    "these are simply identifications of each pair of the opposite faces .",
    "these identifications are _ gluing maps _ of toric ( sub)bundles over @xmath116 .",
    "the gluing maps fibers to fibers , and thus induces a gluing map on the base of the fibration .",
    "such a gluing map @xmath140 then is a translation by some point in @xmath116 , which we then call the _ shift_. once the shift is determined , we need to understand the map of the toric variety fiber to another such fiber .",
    "such a map induces a map of the corresponding polytope , and there is the discrete data  the combinatorics of which faces of the polytope are glued to which  and the continuous parameters which are the multiplicative parameters for the map @xmath141 .",
    "the shift and continuous gluing parameters account for the moduli of semi - abelic varieties of a given combinatorial type ( corresponding to a give cone , i.e.  for given toric variety fiber ) .",
    "the next step we take is to normalize ( simplify ) these continuous parameters by suitable choices of coordinates on each toric variety , wherever possible .",
    "the polytope picture also gives us a description of the theta divisor on the toric part . on each irreducible component of the normalization of the semi - abelic variety we know the numerical class of the polarization divisor , and we will thus start by writing down a general divisor in that numerical class . since the theta divisor on the normalization is the lifting of the divisor on the semi - abelic variety , its restrictions to the glued faces must be glued , which gives some restrictions on the formula for the semi - abelic theta divisor .",
    "finally , the involution on the toric part corresponds to reflection with respect to the center of the cube : notice that since the cube is dissected , the involution may permute the irreducible components of the normalization of the semi - abelic variety .",
    "requiring the theta divisor to be preserved by the involution on the semi - abelic variety will allow us to fix the remaining free shift and gluing parameters .",
    "in the following table we list all the strata in codimension at most @xmath46 in @xmath32 ( notice that the list for @xmath33 would be considerably longer , we refer the reader to @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",

    "we also denote @xmath146 the cone over a smooth quadric surface , given by @xmath147 in @xmath148  it is the toric variety whose associated polytope is the square pyramid .",
    "finally we denote by @xmath113 the toric variety whose associated polytope is a 4-dimensional cube with two 4-dimensional simplices cut off at the opposite corners ( this cone is equivalent to the one generated by @xmath149 , but the one below is more useful for our computations )  its geometry is unimportant to us .

    "we would also like to point out that nakamura @xcite has given an explicit description of all semi - abelic varieties in genus @xmath0 , in a slightly different language .",

    "hence there is a nowhere vanishing function @xmath181 in a neighborhood of the point @xmath170 in @xmath169 such that @xmath182 .",
    "since this holds on mumford s partial compactification , i.e. in codimension 2 in @xmath183 , and since @xmath165 and hence @xmath169 is smooth near this point we can extend @xmath181 as well as the above equality to a neighborhood of @xmath170 in @xmath169 . since @xmath181 does not have zeroes in codimension @xmath25 it is nowhere vanishing .",
    "now the claim follows from the assumption that @xmath184 .",
    "in @xcite the behavior of the gradients of the theta function near the boundary of the partial compactification @xmath185 was studied .",

    ", this analytic method would not work for going deeper into the boundary , and in this section of the text we present the geometric approach to describing the geometry of polarized semi - abelic varieties .",
    "while the case of torus rank one goes back to mumford @xcite , and the geometry of the semi - abelic variety and its polarization is known , the method we explain in detail here will allow us to deal with much more complicated degenerations later on .",
    "still , even for the case of torus rank one , the description of the involution and its fixed points seem to be new .",
    "the singular varieties parameterized by @xmath186 are @xmath187 bundles over a @xmath188-dimensional abelian variety @xmath116 with the @xmath72-section and the @xmath189-section glued with a shift .",

    "the semi - abelian variety acting on this is the @xmath201 bundle which is the @xmath187 bundle with the sections at @xmath202 removed , which is nothing else but the semi - abelian variety defined by the extension @xmath203 .",
    "we have to understand the theta divisor on this singular variety .",
    "the idea , which we also want to apply to other degenerations , is to obtain an equation of the theta divisor on the semi - abelic variety from geometric principles , identify the limits of two - torsion points , and then study the vanishing properties of the gradient of the theta function at these points ( which is to say the vanishing orders of @xmath179 ) .",
    "this simple torus rank one case will showcase the approach that we will take in dealing with semi - abelic varieties of higher torus rank .    in the case of torus",

    "it follows from general theory that we have an involution @xmath221 on the polarized semi - abelic variety which is compatible with the inverse map on the semi - abelian ( open ) variety , i.e. the action of the semi - abelian variety on @xmath112 is equivariant with respect to the involution @xmath221 on @xmath113 and the inverse map of the semi - abelian variety viewed as a group scheme .",
    "we want to write this down explicitly .",
    "however , one needs to be careful in writing down the involution in @xmath222 coordinates .",
    "the issue here is that while we are interested in the involution on a semi - abelic variety , and its fixed points there , analytically the computation happens on the universal cover .",
    "indeed , we are interested in the involution on the @xmath187 bundle over the abelian variety @xmath116 , while formula ( [ thetamumford ] ) is in fact an analytic expression for the lifting of the theta function from the semi - abelian variety to the universal cover @xmath223 .",

    "if we complete the @xmath201 bundle to a @xmath187 bundle , the involution must interchange the @xmath72 and @xmath189 sections , and thus must be given by @xmath234 on the fiber over @xmath235 for some @xmath236 .",
    "for this involution to be preserved by the action ( [ transform ] ) we must then have @xmath237 for any @xmath64 , and thus @xmath238 must be a holomorphic function @xmath239 , and thus constant .",

    "we now determine the limit of two - torsion points on the degenerating family of abelian varieties  these are the fixed points of the involution @xmath221 on the semi - abelic variety .",
    "these points can either lie in the smooth part of @xmath113 or in its singular locus ( which is isomorphic to the abelian variety @xmath116 ) .",
    "we start with the smooth locus .",
    "note that a fixed point of the involution @xmath221 on the @xmath201 bundle over @xmath116 does not necessarily lift to a fixed point of the involution on @xmath226 ; rather it lifts to a point such that its image under the involution is identified with the point itself under the action ( [ transform ] ) . indeed , suppose some @xmath247 descends to a fixed point of @xmath221 on the @xmath201 bundle over @xmath116 .",

    "each of them arises as a limit of a single family of two - torsion points on smooth abelian varieties ( geometrically this means that the multisection defined by these @xmath25-torsion points on the universal family extends locally to sections over the boundary and is unramified there ) .",
    "the fixed points of the involution on the glued @xmath72 and @xmath189 sections of the semi - abelic variety can be obtained from the equation @xmath256 where @xmath257 denotes the glued points on the @xmath72 and @xmath189 sections .",

    "each of these points is the limit of two @xmath25-torsion points on a smooth abelian variety ( the extended multisection of @xmath25-torsion points is ramified here ) and hence has to be counted with multiplicity @xmath25 . together with the @xmath260 fixed points on the smooth part we indeed obtain @xmath168 points",
    "note that for the simple example of an elliptic curve degenerating as @xmath261 , in the limit the one fixed point of the involution on the glued locus is a limit of both two - torsion points @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",

    "however , it makes sense to ask which fixed points are limits of odd points ( and possibly also of some even ones )  these are the fixed points of @xmath221 that generically lie on the semi - abelic theta divisor .",
    "we will now determine these points and then compute the gradients ( with respect to @xmath77 and @xmath158 ) of the semi - abelic theta function @xmath243 at these fixed points lying on the semi - abelic theta divisors , and verify that these gradients generically do not vanish .",

    "we now compute the gradient of the semi - abelic theta function at these points . computing these gradients",

    "to finish the discussion of the torus rank one case , we need to determine which fixed points of the involution on the singular part of the semi - abelic variety lie on the theta divisors and compute the gradient of theta there . indeed , we have @xmath274 which vanishes identically if and only if @xmath38 is an odd two - torsion point .",
    "the gradient of the semi - abelic theta function at such a point is @xmath275 the condition for the derivatives to vanish is exactly to say that @xmath276 .",
    "then the condition for @xmath277 to vanish is equivalent to the corresponding theta function with characteristic vanishing at @xmath193 , which is clearly an independent vanishing condition , so that in this case we arrive at the following    [ codim1ok ] if theorem [ theo : ig ] holds in genus @xmath278 , then in genus @xmath2 the zero locus of each @xmath179 does not have any irreducible components contained in @xmath186 .",

    "the conclusion in each case will be the same : that if theorems [ theo : ig ] and [ theo : gg ] hold in lower genus , then in genus @xmath2 the loci @xmath40 and @xmath31 , when intersected with the stratum of semi - abelic varieties of the type considered , coincide and are both of codimension @xmath2 .",

    "we shall recall the description of these semi - abelic varieties and of their generalized theta divisors , and compute the gradient of the theta divisor , which allows us to compute the extension of @xmath179 to this locus .    in terms of period matrices",

    "for torus rank @xmath25 there is only one other type of degeneration apart from the standard degeneration discussed in the previous section . in this case the decomposition of @xmath316 is obtained by subdividing each unit square into two triangles ( see figure [ figure1a ] ) .",

    "the two copies of the @xmath317 bundle are glued along the @xmath0 coordinate @xmath187 s .",
    "we look at the corresponding toric picture of polytopes : two triangles glued into a square , with the opposite edges further identified , and with the involution being the symmetry with respect to the center of the square  see figure [ figure2 ] .",

    "the simplest choice here is to require the involution to map the coordinates to the coordinates ( which corresponds to the labeling of the coordinate lines in the two @xmath317 s as in the figure ) .",
    "the involution is then given in coordinates as @xmath333 where the subscript indicates on which @xmath317 the point is taken .",
    "to see what the gluings of the three coordinate @xmath187 s on @xmath326 to those on @xmath327 are in these coordinates , we look at the vertices . for example , we see from figure 3 that the gluing identifying the diagonal sides of the triangles glues the vertex corresponding to @xmath334 to @xmath335 , and glues @xmath336 to @xmath337 .",

    "it can also be seen in a more elementary way by looking at the split situation ( @xmath349 ) .",

    "note that each such fixed point is a limit of @xmath401 two - torsion points on a smooth ppav . since @xmath402 such a fixed point of involution @xmath221 is odd ( generically lies on @xmath350 ) if and only if @xmath38 is odd .",
    "we then compute the gradient : indeed @xmath403 vanishes if and only if @xmath404 , and furthermore the vanishing of @xmath405 are the conditions for @xmath330 and @xmath331 to lie on the translated theta divisor  and thus give two more independent conditions , as expected .",
    "in this section we deal with the cones that correspond to strata of non - standard semi - abelic varieties of codimension 4 in @xmath32 .",
    "recall from the table that there are two such strata , both of them in @xmath406 .",
    "the easier case , for which we can easily deduce the appropriate formulae , corresponds to dicing the cube into two triangular prisms ( so the corresponding toric variety is the union of two copies of @xmath407 ) .",
    "the other case - the most complicated that we need to handle in this paper  is that of the dicing into two tetrahedra and one octahedron ( so the corresponding toric variety is the union of two copies of @xmath408 and a toric threefold of type @xmath142  the intersection of two special quadrics in @xmath144 ) .",
    "the simpler case is that of two triangular prisms , i.e.  that of a semi - abelic variety having two irreducible components , the normalization of each being a fibration over some @xmath409 with fibers @xmath407 . as before for the case of two copies of @xmath317 , we denote these two copies by subscripts @xmath352 and @xmath353 respectively , choose coordinates on the second copy to be the image under the involution @xmath221 of the coordinates on the first copy , and finally denote by @xmath158 the ( non - homogenous ) coordinate on @xmath410 .",
    "as for the case of two copies of @xmath317 , which , as explained in @xcite , can be obtained by degenerating the standard @xmath411 compactification when letting the gluing parameter @xmath412 approach zero , this compactification can be obtained from the standard @xmath413 compactification by letting @xmath412 , now one of the three gluing parameters , approach zero .",
    "we then get @xmath414 @xmath415 this answer can be recovered by a straightforward ( even though longer ) computation using the gluings ; one can also easily see that it is correct by checking that it glues correctly and restricts to the theta divisors on @xmath187 and @xmath317 that we computed previously .",
    "the computation of the vanishing locus of the theta gradients is then also a straightforward combination of the previous results , and we omit it .",
    "one can also see in this case that the vanishing of the gradient of the theta function imposes @xmath2 independent conditions .",
    "the only other type of semi - abelic varieties of torus rank 3 that form a codimension @xmath401 locus in @xmath32 ( and also in @xmath33 ) is the stratum corresponding in the toric picture to cutting up the cube into an octahedron and two tetrahedra , see figure [ fig : tetraocta ] below .",
    "tetrahedra and @xmath73 octahedron ]    the normalization of the toric variety has three irreducible components , two of which are @xmath408 s  the toric varieties for which the corresponding polytope is a tetrahedron , while the toric variety corresponding to the octahedron is ( see @xcite ) @xmath416 where we have denoted the homogeneous coordinates on @xmath144 by @xmath417 .",
    "this variety has @xmath55 nodes , they are the coordinate points of @xmath144 . in this description the eight faces of the octahedron correspond to the eight coordinate @xmath317 s contained in @xmath418 , corresponding to the case when all three products are equal to zero .",
    "we will label such a @xmath317 by a triple @xmath419 with @xmath420 , so that on this @xmath317 the coordinates are @xmath421 ( with the other three homogeneous coordinates being zero ) .    here",
    "the gluing parameters are crucial .",
    "indeed , the base abelian variety @xmath116 varies in @xmath422 , so we get @xmath423 parameters .",
    "we also have the three shifts @xmath424 giving another @xmath425 parameters .",
    "thus we must have two more free gluing parameters to make up codimension @xmath401 .",
    "for the two @xmath408 s corresponding to the tetrahedra we choose homogenous coordinates @xmath426 and @xmath427 respectively .",
    "the faces of the tetrahedra are then given by equations @xmath428 and @xmath429 , respectively , for @xmath430 .",
    "similarly to the case of two copies of @xmath317 , we number the @xmath352 and the @xmath353 so as to label the opposite sides with the same index , and for further use we also label the vertices by the number of the corresponding non - vanishing coordinate , see figure [ fig : gluetetraocta_2 ] .         with a view towards further computations , similarly to the case of two copies of a @xmath317 bundle considered above ,",
    "we fix coordinates on @xmath431 and then choose the coordinates on @xmath432 to be their images under the involution @xmath221 , so that we have @xmath433 which is easily seen to be compatible with the gluings by looking at the toric picture .",
    "we now describe the semi - abelic theta divisors on these components .",
    "indeed , we know from the general theory what the restriction of the theta divisor to each fiber is ( this is given by the polytope description ) and that the restriction to any section of the fibration ( such a section is isomorphic to a copy of @xmath116 ) is a principal polarization on the base @xmath116 and hence the translate of a theta divisor .",
    "in particular , on the fiber @xmath418 the theta divisor @xmath434 is a restriction of some section of @xmath435 , while on each @xmath408 fiber the theta divisor is given by some sections of @xmath436 .",
    "it thus follows that there exist constants @xmath437 and points @xmath438 such that the theta divisors are given by @xmath439 we now investigate the action of the involution , requiring it to fix the semi - abelic ( reducible ) theta divisor .",
    "writing down the condition that @xmath221 maps the zero locus of @xmath350 to the zero locus of @xmath351 amounts to @xmath440 where @xmath257 denotes equality up to a non - zero constant factor .",

    ", we note that since the theta function is defined only up to a constant multiple , we can choose @xmath443 .",
    "the involution @xmath221 respects the fibration , i.e.  it lies over an involution on the base @xmath116 and maps fibers to fibers .",
    "each fiber over a fixed point of the involution on @xmath116 is mapped to itself .",
    "we can see from the toric picture that on such a fiber the involution must act by @xmath444 for some @xmath445 . as in the case of torus rank",
    "@xmath73 degenerations , we are again dealing with compactified @xmath446 bundles over the universal cover of the abelian variety @xmath116 .",
    "then the @xmath447 are sections of a bundle , namely the trivial bundle , and thus constants .",
    "notice that we have the freedom of rescaling the coordinates on @xmath448 .",
    "we now choose coordinates in such a way as to get @xmath449 ( note that we could also have @xmath450 ) , so that the involution on the normalization of the @xmath418 bundle over @xmath116 is then given by @xmath451 @xmath452    writing down the condition @xmath453 on the face @xmath454 given by @xmath455 yields @xmath456 @xmath457 @xmath458 which implies ( after flipping the signs of the arguments of the even function @xmath459 on the right - hand - side ) in particular @xmath460 for the shifts , and for the coefficients we get @xmath461 by restricting @xmath434 to different coordinates @xmath317 s contained in @xmath418 we get also @xmath462 and @xmath463 , while all the equalities for the coefficients together imply @xmath464 which , possibly after changing the signs of some coordinates yields @xmath465 , so that finally we have @xmath466    the shifts induced on the base @xmath116 of the semi - abelic variety under the gluings of the faces of the cube are the same as for the gluing of the case @xmath413 discussed above : there is no shift for gluings in the interior of the cube , and shifts by @xmath467 for gluing the faces , which we label as in figure [ fig : tetraocta ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : gluetetraocta ] we labeled the faces of the octahedron with the face of the tetrahedron that gets attached to it ( @xmath468 means that the coordinate @xmath317 given in @xmath431 by @xmath469 is attached ) .    for the gluing maps of the faces of the octahedron and of the tetrahedra , in addition to the shifts we have to describe the permutation of the coordinates on the @xmath317 s being identified",
    " for this , as before , we will see which coordinate points go where  and the scaling parameters .",
    "the vertices of the octahedron correspond to the 6 coordinate axes points @xmath470 where only one homogeneous coordinate is non - zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : gluetetraocta ] we label these points @xmath471 ; note that @xmath472 , @xmath473 , and @xmath474 are then the pairs of antipodal points on the octahedron .        to write down the gluing map from a face of the octahedron to the corresponding face of a tetrahedron in coordinates , we need to make sure that the coordinate points get mapped appropriately .",
    "for example , the `` @xmath475 '' face of the octahedron ( i.e.  the @xmath317 given by @xmath476 ) gets mapped to the @xmath477 face of the first @xmath408 , and looking at figures [ fig : gluetetraocta_2 ] and [ fig : gluetetraocta ] we see that the axes points are mapped @xmath478 , @xmath479 , and @xmath480 . thus the induced map on the @xmath317 must be given in coordinates by @xmath481 where @xmath482 are the gluing parameters , and we use the subscript @xmath352 to keep track of the fact that this is the first @xmath408 .",
    "since we are gluing projective planes , the gluing is only defined up to scaling , and we can thus rescale to get @xmath483 . furthermore , we can then also rescale coordinates @xmath341 and @xmath484 ( without changing the coordinates @xmath485 , which we recall were fixed by prescribing the involution on @xmath418 ) , to get @xmath486 .",
    "thus after these choices we have fixed the coordinates @xmath487 , and got the gluing to be @xmath488 ( recall that there is no shift on @xmath116 for gluing interior faces of a dicing of a cube ) ; we have switched to @xmath489 for coordinates on @xmath317 to make the other cases look similar .",
    "the gluing of the @xmath329 face is obtained from this by acting by the involution @xmath221 , and is given by @xmath490 similarly , by combining the data of which faces get glued from figure [ fig : gluetetraocta ] with the depiction in figure [ fig : tetraocta ] of the shifts on @xmath116 induced by the gluing , and the labeling of the vertices in figure [ fig : gluetetraocta_2 ] ( also shown in figure 8 , where we marked on the faces of the octahedron the labels of the vertices of the face of the tetrahedron glued to that face ) allows us to determine the other gluings .",
    "looking at the fibers of the @xmath317 given by @xmath491 , we have the map @xmath492 where we can choose @xmath493 to be equal to @xmath73 , and then rescale the @xmath494 coordinate so that @xmath495 .",
    "note that we have now fixed all the coordinates on @xmath431 . including the base , the gluing on the @xmath317 bundle given by @xmath491 is finally given by @xmath496 similarly for the face @xmath497 we have @xmath498 and for the gluing of the face @xmath499 we have @xmath500 the gluings for the faces of the tetrahedron corresponding to @xmath432",

    "we now need to determine the fixed points of the involution , and compute the gradients of the semi - abelic theta function there .",
    "notice that in this case for the first time we encounter a singular toric variety , with singularities of @xmath418 being the coordinate points of @xmath144 .",
    "while considering the gradients of a function at a singular point would be hard , we shall see that all fixed points lie either in the interior part of @xmath418 ( i.e. away from the planes where the gluing occurs ) and thus in the smooth locus , or on a @xmath408 corresponding to a tetrahedron , i.e. at least one of the components of the normalization is smooth at these points .",
    "this will allow us to use lemma [ lem : comparison ] .",
    "we first determine the fixed points of @xmath221 in the interior of @xmath418 ( where none of the @xmath485 are zero ) .",
    "as in all of the previous cases , note that our description was of a trivial @xmath418 fibration over @xmath535 , being a subset of @xmath536 .",
    "formula ( [ jonf ] ) is for the involution there , and thus to determine the fixed points on a bundle over @xmath116 , we would need to include the exponential factors similar to the ones needed above .",
    "these can be computed explicitly , but to simplify the presentation ( and since no new idea is necessary ) we will omit them in the following formulae .",
    "we will instead pretend that @xmath537 are even or odd functions of @xmath77 depending on the characteristic ( in fact they have parity up to an exponential factor , which would precisely cancel the other exponential factor from the transformation formulae for the @xmath418 bundle over @xmath116 ) .",

    "since we are only looking for fixed points on @xmath418 , we finally see that @xmath544 and finally that the fixed points are of the form @xmath545 for @xmath544 .",
    "the number of such fixed points is thus equal to @xmath546 .",
    "evaluating the semi - abelic theta divisor at such a point gives ( up to the exponential factors which we omitted in the expressions for @xmath485 , and which cancel with the exponential factors resulting from switching to @xmath537 ) @xmath547 @xmath548 @xmath549 which , as expected , vanishes for @xmath38 odd and @xmath550 or for @xmath38 even and @xmath551 .",
    "it remains to compute the gradient of the theta function at such a fixed point .",
    "these two cases are similar , and we give the formulae for the case of @xmath38 odd and @xmath550 .",
    "note that we are working on @xmath418 and that we can use @xmath77 , @xmath552 , @xmath553 , @xmath554 as local coordinates .",
    "for computing the gradient of @xmath434 near a fixed point as above we locally set @xmath539 , and write @xmath555 , @xmath556 , so that we get for the gradients evaluated at these points @xmath557 @xmath558 @xmath559 ( so that these three all vanish if and only if the three values @xmath560 all vanish ) , and @xmath561 @xmath562 studying the dimension of the locus where these gradients are all zero simultaneously is complicated ( the @xmath77-derivative is hard to deal with ) . however , the stratum of semi - abelic varieties of this type is already codimension 4 in @xmath32 , and it is enough for our purposes to show that the common zero locus of these partial derivatives has codimension at least @xmath25 on this stratum . since the vanishing of the @xmath563 derivatives above implies that three independent points lie on the theta divisor , these vanishing conditions are in codimension at least @xmath0 within the locus of semi - abelic varieties with such a toric structure .    we now need to deal with the fixed points of the involution @xmath221 that are on the `` gluing '' locus , i.e.  where the map from the normalization to the semi - abelic variety is not @xmath73-to-@xmath73 .",
    "a geometric picture of the dicing of the cube as shown in figure [ fig : tetraocta ] ( or a direct calculation ) shows that there are no such fixed points on the faces of the tetrahedra or of the octahedron , and that the only fixed points are on the edges or at the vertices .",
    "note now that all edges of the octahedron are glued to some edges of the tetrahedra ( and the total number of edges after the gluings is @xmath55 ) , while all the vertices are glued together .",
    "we will now compute the fixed points on the tetrahedra , and for gradients will work with @xmath350 and @xmath351 rather than @xmath434 .",

    "@xmath566 @xmath567 which gives the fixed points as @xmath568    evaluating the semi - abelic theta divisor at these points gives ( up to the exponential factors ) @xmath569 which upon using @xmath570 becomes simply @xmath571 thus such a point generically lies on the semi - abelic theta divisor if @xmath38 is odd and the @xmath572 sign is chosen or if @xmath38 is even and the @xmath573 sign is chosen . for the gradient of @xmath350 at such a point",
    "we then get @xmath574 @xmath575 which clearly imposes at least @xmath0 independent conditions .",
    "the computation for the other edges is completely analogous .",
    "the total number of fixed points of @xmath221 of this type is then equal to @xmath576 , each of them being the limit of @xmath401 different @xmath25-torsion points on smooth ppavs .",
    "finally we need to compute the fixed points of @xmath221 over the `` vertices '' of the dicing .",
    "these are computed from the equation @xmath577 which yields simply the fact that @xmath38 is a 2-torsion point on @xmath116 .",
    "since all the vertices are glued together , we thus have @xmath578 fixed points , each arising as the limit of 8 two - torsion points on smooth ppavs . for a consistency check",
    ", we have the valid equality @xmath579 for the number of limits of two - torsion points on smooth ppavs .",
    "the gradient computation is completely analogous to the previous cases and we omit it .",
    "in this section we explain the approaches to handling all the non - standard degeneration types that give strata of codimension 5 in @xmath32 . instead of describing , very laboriously as above , the semi - abelic theta divisors explicitly , we note that our main theorem [ theo : gg ] states essentially that @xmath40 does not have codimension 5 components contained in the boundary .",
    "thus it suffices for our purposes to show that none of these codimension 5 strata can be contained in @xmath40 . to do this",
    "it suffices to exhibit one point not contained in the corresponding variety , and this is done by degeneration . below we give two techniques to do this , one that works easily when the toric variety is a product , and thus handles many ( but not all ) of our cases , and the second , by degenerating to the `` principal '' degenerations  dicing into simplices  that applies in all of our situations .",
    "the two approaches seem to be independently interesting and general .      to handle the first two non - standard codimension 5 cases in @xmath580 , where the fibers of the normalizations of the semi - abelic varieties are of the form @xmath581 or @xmath582 we will use the corresponding cases of @xmath583 and @xmath584 handled above .",
    "we shall explain this for the first of these two cases , the second being analogous  the main point is to use the @xmath187 product structure .",
    "we start with a semi - abelic variety of torus rank @xmath73 , i.e. , a semi - abelic variety whose normalization is a @xmath187 bundle over an abelian variety @xmath65 of dimension @xmath278 .",
    "now we choose a degeneration of @xmath65 to a semi - abelic variety @xmath113 of torus rank @xmath0 with base an abelian variety @xmath116 of dimension @xmath585 , where the fiber of the normalization of @xmath113 is of the form @xmath586 .",
    "under such a degeneration , the divisor of the polarization behaves as follows . for a semi - abelic variety of torus rank 1",
    "we start with a function of the form @xmath587 where @xmath588 , @xmath158 is the coordinate of @xmath187 and @xmath589 is the shift parameter .",
    "degenerating this in the family described above we obtain on each component of the normalization a function of the form @xmath590 where @xmath219 are coordinates on the total space of an @xmath142 or @xmath408 bundle over @xmath116 and @xmath591 is a point of the semi - abelian variety which is a rank @xmath0 extension of @xmath592 and which acts by @xmath593 on the semi - abelic variety ( and thus also on the components of the normalization ) .",
    "we have already seen that it is a non - empty condition that the theta divisor on @xmath113 has a singular point at a fixed point of the involution .",
    "we can then argue as in the discussion of formulae ( [ equ : partial1 ] ) or ( [ equ : partial2 ] ) in section [ sec : thetagradients ] that lying in @xmath594 imposes a non - trivial condition for the @xmath187 bundles over @xmath113 considered here .",
    "this is sufficient for us since the loci under consideration ( being proper subvarieties of @xmath595 ) already have codimension @xmath46 in @xmath32 .",
    "an approach to handle all the non - standard codimension 5 strata is by dicing the cube further , into simplices .",
    "note that all our non - standard codimension 5 strata correspond to cones spanned by forms @xmath596 or @xmath597 .",
    "these cones are thus contained in the corresponding torus rank @xmath5 _ principal cone _ @xmath598 , the so called _ principal cone_. thus the strata of semi - abelic varieties corresponding to each of these cases contain the locus of semi - abelic varieties corresponding to the principal cone .",
    "the principal cone defines in @xmath599 a stratum with the normalization of the corresponding semi - abelic variety being @xmath600 copies of a @xmath601 bundle over some @xmath138 .",

    "there are finitely many combinatorial choices for how a @xmath5-dimensional cube is diced into @xmath5-dimensional simplices ; the resulting semi - abelic theta divisor would depend on this , but will be very similar for all the cases .",
    "since we have the freedom of choosing coordinates on half of the @xmath601 s independently ( the other half would be given by the involution ) , by rescaling the coordinates we can ensure that on each @xmath601 the semi - abelic theta divisor @xmath603 ( for @xmath604 ) has the form @xmath605 for some shifts @xmath606 .",
    "the gluings all happen along the faces of the simplices , i.e.  along @xmath607 s , and there are no free scaling parameters for the gluings , while the shifts are either @xmath72 for the gluings in the interior or the appropriate @xmath467 for gluing the exterior faces of the cube ( each subdivided into @xmath608 simplices ) .",
    "the gluing conditions for @xmath603 and @xmath609 on some face would then be to say that all , possibly except one ( for the variable the vanishing of which gives the faces of the simplex that are on the faces of the cube ) shifts @xmath610 are obtained from the shifts @xmath611 by a suitable permutation ( which tells us how the coordinates on the glued @xmath607 faces of @xmath612 and @xmath613 are identified ) , while if we are gluing faces of the simplices that are faces of the cube , we shift by some @xmath467 .",

    ", one would need to apply a suitable version of ( * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the proof given there seems incomplete .",
    "the @xmath22 case of the proposition , the only one used in that paper , holds , but it seems that the argument given only proves a weaker statement for higher @xmath5 , insufficient to complete our proof . we have not been able to adapt the argument to our situation .    as a corollary",
    "we immediately obtain    [ cor : codimension5ok ] the locus @xmath40 contains no strata of non - standard codimension @xmath46 consisting of non - standard semi - abelic varieties .",
    "since the corresponding cones of these strata are all contained in the principal cone it follows that the closure of the codimension @xmath46 strata contain the locus of principal semi - abelic varieties of torus rank @xmath401 .",

    "the two approaches above allow one to deal with all the types of non - standard semi - abelic varieties giving strata of codimension 5 in @xmath32 without having to undertake a laborious computation similarly to the one for the @xmath640 toric part .",
    "in fact , if the toric part of a semi - abelic variety is a product of @xmath187 and another known case , the formulae for the semi - abelic theta divisor can be obtained rather straightforwardly .    for completeness , in this section",
    "we give the explicit expressions for the involution , gluings , and the semi - abelic theta divisor for the torus rank 3 semi - abelic variety corresponding to the case of two tetrahedra and two square pyramids .",
    "this will therefore complete the explicit computations for _ all types _ of semi - abelic varieties of torus rank up to 3 .",

    "the gluings are then given by @xmath645    ( z,(p : q:0:r:0))_x&(z+b_3,(p : q : r:0))_u ; + ( z,(p : q:0:0:r))_x&(z - b_2,(q : p:0:r))_v ; + ( z,(p:0:q : r:0))_x&(z - b_1,(c^2r:0:p : q))_v ; + ( z,(p:0:q:0:r))_x&(z,(0:r : c^-2q : p))_u ,    @xmath645 for the identifications of the faces of the tetrahedra with the sides of the pyramids ( along @xmath317 s ) .",
    "the new feature of this case compared to that of a dicing into an octahedron and two tetrahedra is the gluings of the bases @xmath646 and @xmath647 of the two pyramids ( along @xmath411 ) , which is given by @xmath648 the resulting expressions for the components of the semi - abelic theta divisors are @xmath649 and @xmath351 and @xmath650 are obtained from these by applying the involution @xmath221 .",
    "in this section we use the explicit descriptions of the semi - abelic theta divisors given above to obtain the proofs of our main theorems .    to attempt to prove conjecture [ theo : n2 ] , one would use the method pioneered in @xcite : by studying the intersection of the closure @xmath30 with the boundary strata .",

    "we recall that the way this is done is by using the log - differentials @xmath652 , which is to say that one computes the gradient of the semi - abelic theta divisor with respect to the coordinate @xmath323 on the base of the semi - abelic variety , and to the coordinates on the fiber , and then has to take into account the `` gluing '' singularities , see eg .",
    "* formula ( 28 ) ) for the case when the toric variety is @xmath653 .",
    "one would now proceed by studying @xmath654 . indeed ,",
    "assume for contradiction that @xmath23 had an irreducible component of codimension 4 in @xmath1 ( the results of ciliberto and van der geer @xcite apply to show there could not be a component of codimension 3 ) . by the result of keel and sadun @xcite",
    "this component would have to intersect the boundary of @xmath32 , and we let @xmath655 be its intersection with the boundary , which is thus of codimension 5 in @xmath32 . if @xmath655 were to intersect the locus of standard semi - abelic varieties , the vertical singularities there are completely described in @xcite , and noting that an analog of lemma 16.1 there applies to show that if the dimension of the space of vertical singularities is at least 2 , @xmath656 , we see that @xmath655 can not have a codimension 5 component intersecting the locus of standard semi - abelic varieties .",
    "the situation with non - standard torus rank 2 semi - abelic varieties is also handled in @xcite , and thus it remains for us to deal with the possibility that @xmath657 ; note also that @xmath655 can not contain @xmath651 ( where the set of standard compactifications of torus rank 5 is open ) , and thus @xmath655 must intersect @xmath658 , and moreover it must intersect some locus of non - standard compactifications there . for all codimension",

    "the case of two copies of @xmath407 is straightforward  one can use the description of the semi - abelic theta divisor given by ( [ p1p2 ] ) and compute directly , or note that this case arises as the limit of the standard torus rank 3 case when one of the gluing parameters approaches zero ( this of course also equivalent to the case when it approaches infinity ) , so that all the equations and descriptions arise as limits of those for the standard case .",
    "the hardest case to deal with is perhaps that of the toric part being @xmath640 .",
    "note that here the normalization of the toric variety is itself singular .",
    "here one would need to have an appropriately corrected and generalized version of ( * ? ? ?",
    "12.1 ) , and also a geometric understanding of the singularities of the theta divisors possibly appearing at singular points of the @xmath142 fibration .",
    "this seems plausible , but , as before , we were not able to complete this step .",
    "we want to ( re)prove the statement that the codimension of @xmath24 in @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 for @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath661 this is trivial . for @xmath662",
    "the theta divisor of an indecomposable ppav is smooth , and the theta divisor of a product of two elliptic has one singular point which is not of multiplicity three . for higher",
    "@xmath2 , suppose the codimension of some irreducible component @xmath635 of @xmath24 is equal to @xmath663 .",
    "we then know , since @xmath24 is given locally by @xmath2 equations , that @xmath664 , and we want to prove the equality . for @xmath665 , by a theorem of keel and sadun @xcite any codimension @xmath2 subvariety of @xmath1 is non - complete , and thus the closure @xmath666 of @xmath635 in @xmath32 must intersect the boundary of @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the codimension of @xmath667 within @xmath32 must then be equal to @xmath668 . if @xmath27 ( which are the only cases when we can prove the theorem ) , if @xmath669 , it would follow that the codimension of @xmath670 in @xmath32 is at most 5 , and thus @xmath670 must intersect one of the strata of semi - abelic varieties of types described above . for each of these cases from the description of the vanishing locus of @xmath179 ( given at the end of the corresponding section of the text )",
    "we see that if theorem [ theo : ig ] holds in genus @xmath117 , where @xmath5 is the torus rank , then the intersection of @xmath40 ( and thus of @xmath670 contained in it ) with the corresponding stratum is codimension strictly greater than @xmath2 within @xmath32 .",
    "it thus follows that the codimension of @xmath666 in @xmath32 is at least @xmath2 .",
    "recall that this theorem says that the vanishing locus of a function @xmath179 on @xmath32 , which is the extension to the boundary of the gradient of the theta function at the corresponding odd two - torsion point , does not have an irreducible component of codimension less than 6 contained in the boundary .",
    "indeed , in the previous sections we described explicitly the functions @xmath179 for each type of semi - abelic varieties giving a stratum of codimension at most 5 in @xmath32 . for the simplest case of torus rank 1 degenerations we proved proposition [ codim1ok ] showing that @xmath40 , the zero locus of @xmath179 , does not have any irreducible components contained in @xmath186 . in the following sections above we then handled all the types of semi - abelic varieties in @xmath671 that give loci of codimension at most 5 in @xmath32 . from the explicit descriptions of the theta divisors , we know , as in the proof of proposition [ codim1ok ] , that the intersection of @xmath40 with the corresponding locus is of codimension greater than @xmath2 in @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , since the zero locus of the gradient @xmath179 is locally given by the vanishing of @xmath2 functions , any irreducible component of @xmath40 has codimension at most @xmath2 in @xmath32 , and we have arrived at a contradiction .",
    "it thus follows that @xmath40 has no irreducible components of codimension less than 6 in @xmath32 that are contained in the boundary of @xmath32 , and the theorem is thus proven .                        c.  ciliberto and g.  van  der geer .",
