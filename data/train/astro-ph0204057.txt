    "the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 was identified as an x - ray source over thirty years ago ( gursky 1971 ) .",
    "as one of the brightest active galactic nuclei ( agn ) accessible in the x - ray band , it has since been extensively studied by missions such as , , , ,  and more recently ,  and . this observational focus has revealed that the spectrum of ngc 4151 from 0.1100 kev is comprised of a complex mixture of emission and absorption components , probably originating in a variety of locations from the innermost parts of the putative accretion disk in ngc 4151 , out to the extended narrow - line region of the galaxy .",
    "given this spectral complexity it remains to be seen whether ngc 4151 should or should not be considered as an archetype of its class ( ulrich 2000 ; zdziarski 2001 ) .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray to @xmath7-ray continuum emanating from the active nucleus of ngc 4151 appears to be produced by the thermal comptonization of soft seed photons ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ; zdziarski 1994 , 1996 , 2000 ; petrucci 2000 ) .",
    "there is also a contribution from reprocessing in the form of compton - reflection and iron - k fluorescence components ( e.g. maisack 1991 ; yaqoob 1995 ; zdziarski 1996 ; warwick 1996 ; piro 2002 ; zdziarski 2001 ) .",
    "below @xmath8 5 kev the hard continuum is strongly cut - off by photoelectric absorption in a substantial ( @xmath9 ) line - of - sight gas column density ( e.g. holt 1980 ; yaqoob 1993 ; weaver 1994a , b ) .",
    "one of the long - standing problems in x - ray studies of ngc 4151 has been to understand the exact nature and origin of this absorption .",
    "x - ray observations show very clearly that the cut - off is not as abrupt as one might expected for absorption in a uniform slab of cold solar abundance material ( i.e. , the increase in opacity with decreasing photon energy is less rapid than predicted for a uniform cold absorber ) .",
    "various solutions have been suggested including an inhomogeneous cold absorber ( the partial covering model ; holt 1980 ; weaver 1994b ) , an absorber with grossly non - solar abundances ( yaqoob & warwick 1991 ) and the partial photoionization of the absorbing medium ( i.e. , the warm absorber model , e.g. , krolik & kallman 1984 ) . however",
    ", none of these has provided a really satisfactory explanation of the nature of the absorber or the processes which give rise to the large changes in the absorption apparent in ngc 4151 on timescales of days or longer ( yaqoob 1989 , yaqoob 1993 ) .",
    "unfortunately the presence of additional soft x - ray emission components which first appear at @xmath8 2 kev and dominate the spectrum below @xmath8 1 kev ( weaver 1994a ; warwick , smith & done 1995 ) adds further to the complication .  and  hri measurements ( elvis , briel & henry 1983 ; morse 1995 ) and more recently observations by  ( ogle 2000 ;",
    "yang , wilson & ferruit 2001 ) have revealed that much of this soft emission emanates from a spatial resolved ( @xmath10 kpc ) highly ionized plasma coincident with the optical narrow - line region of the galaxy .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the complex x - ray absorption column in ngc 4151 and in particular focus on the question of whether at least some of the properties of the absorber can be explained in terms of photoionization effects .",
    "our approach has been to use a high signal - to - noise  observation to define the parameters of a `` spectral template '' representative of the underlying continuum and other features in the x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 .",
    "we then use this template to investigate the spectral variations which occurred in ngc 4151 during a `` long - look observation '' carried out in the latter stages of the  mission .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we specify our spectral template model and determine the relevant spectral parameters using the  measurements . in ",
    "3 we give brief details of the   long - look observation , outline the data reduction techniques employed and characterize the flux and spectral variability apparent in the source light curve . in the next section",
    "we describe the detailed spectral modelling of the  data focusing on the evidence for a photoionized absorber .",
    "finally in  5 we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "the broad bandpass of the instruments on  is a tremendous help when attempting to constrain the form of the hard x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 . during the period 1996 - 1999 , this source was observed three times with  as reported by piro ( 2002 ) .",
    "here we utilize the observation carried out in january , 1999 , which provides the best signal to noise ratio of the available datasets .",
    "x - ray data from three of the four instruments on  ( namely the lecs , mecs and pds instruments - see parmar 1997 , boella 1997 , frontera 1997 respectively were obtained from the asi science data center . in the case of the lecs and mecs instruments",
    ", source spectra were preprocessed via standard  procedures using on - source extraction regions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 radius respectively .",
    "standard blank - sky background files were available for the lecs and mecs whereas in the case of the pds instrument , background - subtracted source spectra were supplied directly .",
    "the spectra were accumulated over the full observation interval ( see piro 2002 ) to give an on - source exposure time of 83 ks in the mecs and roughly half this for the other instruments .    a bl lac object ( ms 1207.9 + 3945 )",
    "is located @xmath13 to the north of ngc 4151 .",
    "piro ( 2002 ) note that its count rate is @xmath14 and @xmath15 of that of ngc 4151 in the mecs and lecs instruments respectively .",
    "the contamination of the ngc 4151 spectra will be negligible for the mecs but may , on the basis of the piro ( 2002 ) figures , be as high as @xmath820@xmath16 in the lecs at @xmath17 kev . in practice",
    "the presence of this confusing source in the lecs data will have little overall impact on our spectra fitting analysis ( given the relatively soft spectrum of the bllac - warwick , smith & done 1995 ) .",
    "spectral fitting was carried out using the * xspec v11.0.1 * software package with the sept 1997 instrument response matrices .",
    "for this purpose the source spectra were grouped to give a minimum of 20 counts per bin and the data below 1 kev ( from the lecs ) were excluded to avoid complications relating to the form of the soft x - ray emitting components and presence of the soft confusing source .",
    "we adopt a spectral template model which includes the following emission components :    1 .   a power - law continuum with a normalization , @xmath18 , and photon index , @xmath19 , exhibiting a high - energy break at 100 kev ; 2 .",
    "a neutral compton - reflection component ( modelled by pexrav in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) with only the reflection scaling factor , @xmath20 , as a free parameter .",
    "the parameters relating to the incident continuum were tied to those of the hard power - law component .",
    "in addition cos @xmath21 was fixed at 0.5 and the metal abundance in the reflector was fixed at the solar value ; 3 .",
    "an iron k@xmath5 emission line of intensity @xmath22 at an energy @xmath23 ( with an intrinsic line width @xmath24 set to 0.1 kev ) ; 4 .   a second power - law continuum representative of all the additional soft x - ray emitting components with a slope coupled to that of the primary hard continuum but with a free normalization , @xmath25 .",
    "as noted earlier the complex absorption in ngc 4151 has in the past been modelled in number of ways , with arguably the most successful approach being the partial covering ( sometimes referred to in the literature as a dual absorber ) model ( e.g. holt 1980 ; yaqoob & warwick 1991 ; weaver 1994b ) . in the partial covering scenario",
    "a fraction @xmath26 of the hard continuum is absorbed by a cold gas column density @xmath27 , whilst the remaining @xmath28 fraction of the continuum intercepts a reduced column density @xmath29 . in the present paper we prefer to focus on a model employing the same number of free parameters but with the absorber stratified along the line of sight rather than perpendicular to it . in our preferred scenario the complex absorber is represented as product of two absorption components , namely a warm column density @xmath30 and a cold gas column @xmath31 . for the former we use multiplicative table models in xspec generated via the photoionization code xstar ( kallman 2001 ) .",
    "the ionization state of the warm gas is governed by the ionization parameter @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the source luminosity in the 0.0136 - 13.6 kev bandpass in @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the number of hydrogen atoms / ions in the gas per @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the distance from the central source to the inner edge of the warm cloud in cm .",
    "we assumed an ionizing continuum of the form adopted by krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) .",
    "for further details of the photoionization modelling see griffiths ( 1998 ) .",
    "the cold absorption was represented by the * wabs * model in xspec which is based on the absorption cross - sections tabulated in morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . here",
    "we assume solar abundances in both the warm and cold absorber .",
    "the adopted spectral model assumes that _ only _ the hard power - law continuum is subject to the complex absorption .",
    "however absorption arising in the line - of - sight column density through our own galaxy is applied to all four emission components ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the results of fitting this spectral template to the  data are detailed in table  [ bsax4 - 1 ] , which lists the best fitting values for the nine free parameters of the model .",
    "the quoted errors ( here as elsewhere in this paper ) are at the 90% confidence level as defined by a @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41=2.71 criterion ( _ i.e. _ assuming one interesting parameter ) .",
    ".the results of fitting the `` spectral template '' to the  observation [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ ascallwad ]    if we relax some of the parameter constraints then further improvements in the fit to the  long - look segments can be obtained .",
    "for example , if we allow @xmath23 and @xmath22 to vary ( but with the parameter value tied across the eight spectral datasets ) , then we obtain @xmath42 for 3663 d - o - f , with best fit values of @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 ( which according to the f - test is significant at greater than 5 sigma ) . as a further step",
    "if we allow the two column density components to vary ( with respect to the  values ) then @xmath45 for 3661 d - o - f with n@xmath46 and n@xmath47 ( which is very highly significant according to the f - test ) .",
    "in all these fits the largest residuals are in range 12 kev , where the simple power - law model of the soft emission components is clearly a gross over - simplification ( ogle 2000 ) .",
    "however , the presence of these 1 - 2 kev residuals is very unlikely to influence our interpretation of the observed spectral variations in terms of a variable warm absorber ( see below ) .",
    "the spectral fitting of the  long - look observation reveals a range of ionization states for the warm absorber in ngc 4151 ( table  [ ascallwad ] ) , a clear correlation is apparent between the ionization parameter ( @xmath1 ) and the level of the hard continuum ( @xmath48 ) for the first five segments of the observation , which correspond to the period of increasing flux in the light curve ( fig  [ ioncorr ] ) .",
    "however as the flux drops ( segments 68 ) the correlation is lost and the ionization state remains at a comparable level to that seen at the peak of the lightcurve .",
    "in contrast , in the   observation , although the continuum was at a level comparable to that at the peak of  light curve , in this case the ionization of the warm absorber was at the bottom end of the range observed with   ( fig  [ ioncorr ] ) . the observed correlation in the  long - look data lends support to the warm absorber interpretation for the observed absorbing column and we argue in  5 that the lack of a sustained correlation between ionization level and the continuum flux , is not necessarily inconsistent with this description .",
    "the normalization of the soft power - law component , @xmath25 , varies by @xmath49 during the  long - look observation .",
    "there is also an apparent factor 2 decline in the soft component over the 18 month interval between the  and  observations , although as noted earlier there may be some preferential contamination of the  data by the nearby bl lac object .",
    "bearing in mind that much of the soft emission in ngc 4151 originates in the spatially extended component recently imaged by , ( ogle 2000 ; yang 2001 ) , these results would suggest that there may be some leakage of the hard continuum flux through the absorber down to @xmath17 kev ( as suggested by fig  [ rms ] ) whereas in the current spectral modelling the cut - off is nearer to 2 kev ( see fig  [ model ] ) .",
    "since the complex absorption in ngc 4151 is likely to arise from gas exhibiting a range of ionization parameters , our two component ( cold + warm gas ) model must , at best , represent only a rough approximation to the real system .    ) and the normalization of the hard power - law continuum for the eight segments of the  `` long - look '' observation .",
    "the red points mark the segments where the lightcurve is rising , the green points mark the segments where the lightcurve is falling . the point marked by the star symbol is from the  observation ; the error bar is larger in this case due to the additional free parameters in the spectral fitting . ,",
    "one of the major advantages of the warm absorber description is that it is based on a physical model which is , in principle , readily testable .",
    "for example , given sufficient spectral resolution , sensitivity and dynamic range , the true ionization state of the warm gas can be determined directly from the absorption edges present in the x - ray spectrum , a further key diagnostic , somewhat more in tune with current measurement capabilities in the case of heavily absorbed sources such as ngc 4151 , is that ionization parameter of the warm gas should track the intensity of the ionizing radiation field , albeit in a complex fashion ( nicastro 1999 ) . in contrast",
    "the popular partial covering ( or dual absorber ) models are based on rather arbitrary , constructed geometries which are very difficult to verify .",
    "previous studies of ngc 4151 have failed to demonstrate in an unambiguous fashion that the absorbing medium in ngc 4151 does respond to changes in the level of the incident hard continuum ( yaqoob 1989 ; fiore 1990 ; warwick 1996 ; piro 2002 ) .",
    "however , the   long - look observation provides an excellent opportunity to study the response of the absorber to continuum changes .",
    "the correlation between ionization parameter and the level of the hard continuum apparent over the rising part of the light curve ( fig .",
    "[ ioncorr ] ) would appear to be the signature of a partially photoionized medium .",
    "however , a problem then presents itself in that the relatively high ionization state is maintained over the latter part of the observation despite the decline in the continuum .",
    "a possible explanation for this behaviour is that the timescale on which significant continuum variations are occurring ( @xmath50 s ) is somewhat shorter than the timescale on which the balance between photoionization and recombination can be re - established in the plasma .",
    "the result is that with quasi - continuous continuum variations ( of which the light curve in fig . [ light ] represents only a brief snapshot ) the warm absorber is invariably in a non - equilibrium ionization state .",
    "nicastro ( 1999 ) have discussed some of the complications which arise in such circumstances and show that the delayed response of a medium to sharp increases and decreases in the incident ionizing flux can give rise to variations in the ionization state apparently unconnected with flux changes ( and even anti - correlations of ionization level with flux ) . in the case of ngc 4151 there is clear evidence that the medium is slow to respond ; for example even during the period when the ionization parameter and the continuum show a correlation , the former changes by a factor 1.8 compared to a factor of 2.5 for the latter .",
    "however , the fact that the degree of ionization tracks the light curve better during the rising segment than during the decline is consistent with the fact that @xmath51 , as is evident from fig . 1 of nicastro ( 1999 ) .    the parameter values for the warm absorber in ngc 4151 are not too far removed from one of the standard cases considered by krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) (",
    "although the assumed form of underlying continuum is somewhat modified with respect to the version in krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) , which we have adopted in the present work ) .",
    "for example , taking @xmath52 and @xmath53 as representative values for the warm absorber in ngc 4151 and taking the distance of the warm medium from the continuum source to be 1 pc , then the inferred gas density is @xmath54 .",
    "table 1 in krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) gives the corresponding equilibration timescales for selected ions in such a plasma .",
    "the warm absorber cut - off is best measured between 26 kev , where absorption edges due to the hydrogen- and helium - like ions of mg , si , s , ar and ca will be of importance ( although not individually resolvable in the   data ) . for these ions",
    "the relevant equilibration timescales are typically between @xmath55 s. in fact , the measured column density for the warm absorber in ngc 4151 of @xmath56 implies @xmath57 pc ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) , which in turn ( since @xmath58 ) , requires a factor 4 reduction in the equilibration timescales quoted by krolik & kriss .",
    "nevertheless it is still true that the variability timescale in ngc 4151 is short enough for the warm absorber to be out of ionization equilibrium as required .",
    "since different ions reach their equilibrium abundance , for a given flux of ionizing radiation , on different timescales , the detailed form of the absorption cut - off will depended on the luminosity history of the source stretching back over a period equal to the longest relevant equilibration timescale , which in ngc 4151 will be @xmath59 s.      in the present paper we have modelled the iron k@xmath5 emission in a very simple fashion , namely as a single narrow line at an energy appropriate to cold ( _ i.e. _ neutral or low - ionization ) material . in the long - look  observation ,",
    "the measured line flux was @xmath60 , with no evidence for any variations in either the line intensity or in the line profile during the observation period .",
    "the  observation gave a somewhat higher value ( at the @xmath61 level ) suggesting the possibility of line variations , but on the other hand the  value is in excellent agreement with the iron k@xmath5 line flux measured by  almost ten years earlier .",
    "the lack of significant variability on timescales of many years suggests the origin of this narrow component is in a medium located well outside of the immediate surroundings of the nuclear source ( _ i.e. _ not in a putative accretion disk ) , but probably does not exclude the region occupied by the warm absorber .",
    "however , the predicted range of iron ionization states in the warm medium is fe xvi  fexxi with the associated k@xmath5 line emission ranging in energy from 6.4  6.6 kev .",
    "since the measured line energy excludes much of this range , we conclude that the bulk of the line equivalent width ( which ranges from 82  195 ev during the eight segments of the observation , depending on the continuum level ) derives from less strongly photoionized material located further from the nucleus than the warm medium .",
    "the cold absorber in our model can only account for the observed iron k@xmath5 flux if it subtends a full @xmath62 steradians as viewed from the central source and has an iron abundance a factor 3 higher than solar .",
    "in contrast with previous claims suggesting a complex broad iron line structure in ngc 4151 ( yaqoob , 1995 ; wang 1999 , 2001 ; yaqoob , 2001 ) , we find no compelling evidence to include a relativistically broadened line in any of our modelling ( the best fit intrinsic line width of the `` narrow '' line in the  data was @xmath63 ev but this may over estimate the true line width given the sis calibration uncertainties ) .",
    "the lack of any variability in the line profile during the observation contrasts with earlier claims of line profile variability in ngc 4151 on @xmath64 s timescales ( wang 2001 ) .",
    "clearly a very extended broad - line profile is easily confused with a continuum form including a non - negligible contribution from compton reflection and modified by a complex absorption .",
    "the complex variable nature of the underlying continuum and the absorption may then easily manifest itself as variability in the broad - line profile .",
    "we will return to this issue at a later date utilizing newly acquired data from .",
    "previous observations of ngc 4151 with both  and  have revealed an apparent correlation between spectral index measured in the 210 kev band and the level of the underlying continuum ( perola 1986 ; yaqoob & warwick 1991 ; yaqoob 1993 ) .",
    "[ ginga ] shows a compilation of measurements from  and  ( taken from yaqoob 1993 ) which suggests that as the source brightens the photon index steepens , from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , at which point the correlation saturates .",
    "yaqoob ( 1993 ) also note that the spectral slope changes occur on roughly the same timescale as the flux variations . however , a perplexing aspect of the spectral index flux correlation observed in the medium energy bandpass is that the effect is not mirrored in the hard x - ray / soft gamma regime ( johnson 1997 ; piro 2002 ) .",
    "an underlying assumption of the spectral template model adopted in the present paper is that the spectral index of the hard power - law continuum in ngc 4151 remains constant ( at a value @xmath67 ) , as the continuum flux changes , in apparent contradiction to the correlation noted above .",
    "( testing this assumption against the  observation demonstrates that the  datasets are broadly consistent with the assumed value of @xmath19=1.65 , however the values are poorly constrained due to the very limited effective bandpass , and the fact that the values of @xmath19 derived are very dependent on the exact details of the applied spectral model ) .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that the spectral index versus relation may actually be a misinterpretation of the softening of the ngc 4151 spectrum as the source flux increases , bearing in mind that the reported correlation was established using both proportional counter data with limited spectral resolution and a highly simplified spectral model ( in fact just a power - law continuum model , modified by a heavy cold absorbing column ) . to this end",
    "we have taken our spectral template model and an appropriate   response , and simulated a set of five  spectra using xspec . in this simulation ,",
    "the normalization of the hard power - law continuum was increased in steps from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , but with all the other parameter values , ( including the ionization parameter and the _ flux _ in the compton - reflection component ) frozen at the values obtained from the  spectral fitting .",
    "the simulated 3.520 kev  spectra were then each fitted with a simple absorbed power - law model ( _ cf . _",
    "yaqoob & warwick 1991 ; yaqoob 1993 ) and the effective photon spectral index measured .",
    "the result was a spectral index versus 210 kev flux correlation closely matching the reported correlation ( fig .",
    "[ ginga ] ) .",
    "since the simulation did not include any of the complications associated with varying ionization parameter of the warm absorber , it follows that the observed spectral changes are induced solely as a result of the presence of a non - varying spectrally - hard compton - reflection component . clearly , in this scenario , as the direct continuum brightens , the relative contribution of the compton - reflection declines and the overall spectrum softens until eventually the measured spectral index saturates at the value pertaining to the underlying continuum .",
    "there has been much debate as to whether ngc 4151 is simply a very bright , nearby representative of the broad class of galaxies harbouring luminous seyfert nuclei or a unique object ( ulrich 2000 ) . in the x - ray band",
    "this uncertainty is due , in large measure , to the heavy , complex and variable absorption which characterizes the 26 kev spectrum of ngc 4151 but which is not mirrored in the great majority of well - studied seyfert galaxies ( mrk 6 is arguably the best known example of a ngc 4151 analogue , feldmeier 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of two archival datasets of ngc 4151 , one from  the other from , which tests the hypothesis that the complex absorption is due to a combination of warm and cold gas distributed along the line of sight to the active seyfert nucleus in this source .",
    "we find that this relatively simple model does indeed provide a good description of the two datasets in question and , in fact , gives a reasonable fit to all of the  and   observations from the past seven years .",
    "our key finding is that the warm absorber corresponds to a relative low density ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) gas , with a column density of @xmath56 and with ionization parameter in the range log(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 .",
    "since the equilibration timescale for the dominant ions is of the same order or longer than the timescale of the continuum variability , the warm component is invariably observed in a non - equilibrium ionization state .",
    "non - equilibrium conditions help explain why past studies based on relatively short observations spaced by weeks , months or years have failed to identify a consistent signature of the warm absorber in this source .    in a recent paper , krolik & kriss ( 2001 )",
    "discuss how evaporation from the inner edge of the obscuring torus in an agn can give rise to an inhomogeneous photoionized wind in which a broad range of temperatures coexist in equilibrium .",
    "krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) then go on to suggest that this wind is the origin of the highly ionized , warm absorbers seen in over half of type 1 seyfert galaxies . for most seyfert 1 galaxies the properties of the warm absorber are inferred from the ovii and oviii absorption edges , whereas in ngc 4151 the combination of warm and cold absorbers gives rise to a sharp spectral cutoff below @xmath70 kev , thus eliminating the oxygen features . nevertheless ,",
    "as noted earlier , the inferred properties of the warm component in ngc 4151 are not too far removed from one the standard cases detailed by krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to hypothesise that the warm absorber in ngc 4151 originates in such a multi - temperature wind , but that the unusually complex character of the absorption is due to a line of sight which grazes the top edge of the obscuring torus so as to intercept a substantial column of _ both _ the warm and cold components .",
    "in essence in terms of its x - ray absorption properties , ngc 4151 is intermediate between the seyfert galaxies in which the absorption , if present , is predominantly due to the krolik & kriss s multi - temperature wind ( type 1 objects ) and those where the cooler material of the obscuring torus dominates ( type 2 objects ) .",
    "the other findings of this paper are that ( i ) the reported hardening of the spectrum of ngc 4151 as the continuum level falls may be simply due to the presence of an underlying ( hard and relatively constant ) compton - reflection component and ( ii ) there is no compelling evidence for a relativistically broadened iron k@xmath5 line in ngc 4151 contrary to earlier claims .    in summary , it appears that many of the x - ray properties of ngc 4151 can be explained in terms of the current paradigm for seyfert galaxies .",
    "future observations with ,  and  will be able to test the degree to which our spectral template description is valid and should further illuminate the question of whether ngc 4151 should be regarded as the archetypal seyfert galaxy .",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of the complex absorption apparent in the 26 kev x - ray spectrum of the bright nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 4151 . </S>",
    "<S> we first utilize the large bandpass and medium spectral resolution afforded by  data to construct a 1100 kev spectral template , which assumes the absorption arises in both warm ( _ i.e. _ partially photoionized ) and cold gas present in the line of sight to the active nucleus of the source . </S>",
    "<S> application of this spectral model to an  `` long - look '' observation of ngc 4151 reveals a partial correlation between the underlying continuum flux and the ionization state of the warm absorber . </S>",
    "<S> such a correlation is an intrinsic property of a warm absorber and argues strongly in favour of this interpretation for the complex absorbing column over alternative partial covering models .    </S>",
    "<S> the warm absorber in ngc 4151 has a column density of @xmath0 with ionization parameter in the range log(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 . the inferred relatively low density ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) for the warm gas , implies an equilibration timescale for the dominant ions of the same order or longer than the timescale of the continuum variability . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the warm component will invariably be observed in a non - equilibrium ionization state . the warm absorber in ngc 4151 </S>",
    "<S> may be identified as a multi - temperature wind produced by evaporation from the inner edge of an obscuring torus as discussed in a recent paper by krolik & kriss ( 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unusually complex character of the absorption seen in ngc 4151 may then be explained in terms of a fortuitous line of sight which grazes the top edge of the obscuring torus so as to intercept a substantial column of both the warm and cold gas .    </S>",
    "<S> we also find that ( i ) the reported hardening of the spectrum of ngc 4151 as the continuum level falls may be simply due to the presence of an underlying ( hard and relatively constant ) compton - reflection component and ( ii ) the iron k@xmath5 line has a relatively narrow gaussian profile and a line flux that remains constant over both short ( days ) and long ( months to years ) timescales - a relativistically broadened iron k@xmath5 feature was not required in our modelling </S>",
