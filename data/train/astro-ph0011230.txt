    "the discovery of superluminal motions in a radio flare from grs 1915 + 105 by mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) in many ways launched the field of microquasar astrophysics .",
    "such flares have been seen since then ( e.g. fender et al . , 1999 ) , and always seem to have peak flux densities of @xmath3 jy .",
    "the resolved jets with @xmath4 show spectral evolution from optically thick to optically thin , and seem to recur every few days during an ejection episode .",
    "the ejection episodes themselves recur on timescales of a few years . while harmon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed an association between the class a flares and hard x - ray activity , no simultaneous time - resolved x - ray coverage has yet been obtained .",
    "the second class of long - wavelength events were first clearly characterized by fender et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , whose same - day ir / radio observations showed flares with flux densities of @xmath5 mjy and decay timescales of @xmath6 minutes .",
    "the brightness temperature in the radio implied a synchrotron origin for the flares and the constancy of the decay timescale over 4 decades of frequency implied that adiabatic expansion dominates the cooling process .",
    "eikenberry et al . ( 1998a , b ) observed a long sequence of class b flares in the ir over two nights in august 1997 .",
    "these flares had peak flux densities @xmath7 mjy and recurrence timescales of @xmath8 minutes .",
    "simultaneous x - ray observations with rxte revealed that these flares are associated with complex x - ray behaviors ( figure 1 ) . in particular , the flares come after the hard x - ray dips , during which the blackbody temperature in the inner disk drops while the power - law index hardens .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) first interpreted dips such as these as the _ disappearance _ of the inner accretion disk , and combined with the observations of fender at al .",
    "( 1997 ) and eikenberry et al .",
    ", ( 1998a , b ) , we recognize that * these events provide the first direct time - resolved observations of relativistic jet formation in a black hole system . *",
    "mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) made simultaneous ir / radio / x - ray observations of several class b flares , finding wavelength - dependent time delays , with the longer wavelengths peaking later .",
    "such behavior is roughly consistent with that expected from an expanding van der laan blob , and extrapolations based on this timing would indicate that the ejection occurs near the end of the hard x - ray dip .",
    "the existence of a third class of long - wavelength flares was first clarified through ir / x - ray observations by eikenberry et al .",
    "these flares have peak flux densities in the ir of @xmath9 mjy and are associated with rapid soft x - ray dips ( figure 2 ) , during which the blackbody temperature increases and the power - law index softens ( as opposed to the hard class b dips ) .",
    "these flares also seem to explain the quasi - steady ir excess during similar x - ray behaviors in 1997 ( eikenberry et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ir flares appear to begin _ before _ the x - ray activity , implying an `` outside - in '' propagation of the disturbance  opposite of the class b behavior .",
    "the spotty coverage from rxte makes `` aliasing '' a problem for verifying this",
    ". however , eikenberry et al . ( 2000 ) showed that no constant delay fits with the x - rays preceeding the ir flares , and even a non - steady delay would have to reach up to @xmath10 seconds .",
    "thus , the `` ir - first '' explanation seems the least objectionable for the observations .",
    "a key issue here is the reality of the distinction between the three classes presented above .",
    "the class c flares seem distinguishable from class b due to the marked differences in their corresponding x - ray behaviors ( soft versus hard dips , ir - first versus x - ray - first ) , as well as differences in recurrence times and amplitudes .",
    "class b flares , on the other hand , behave in many ways like `` baby jet '' versions of class a ejections . in particular , the relative amplitudes and decay timescales are roughly consistent with identical ejections , but with @xmath11 times less mass in the class b events . however , dhawan et al . ( 2000 ) have used vlba to resolve the class b events , and find that their axis of motion differs significantly from the class a events .",
    "thus , it appears that there are in fact at least 3 distinct modes of jet production in grs 1915 + 105 ."
