    "as the increase of connectivity in and between different complex systems , spread of many diseases or viruses is becoming more and more prevalent in our society@xcite .",
    "for instance , outbreaks of many infectious diseases , including severe acute respiratory syndromes ( sars ) , swine flu ( h1n1 ) , and the recent ebola virus , caused great damage and loss of life .",
    "the spread of computer and mobile phone viruses brought about a great deal trouble to human life and serious damage to economy .",
    "understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of those spreading processes and designing efficient control strategies become very important and urgent tasks , which bring together a lot of researchers from areas of biology , sociology , mathematics , physics , engineering , etc@xcite .",
    "mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has a long history of more than two hundred years@xcite .",
    "generally , the population is divided into several classes : susceptible , infected and recovered individuals .",
    "susceptible individuals represent those who can contract the infection .",
    "infected individuals were previously susceptible individuals and got infected by the disease .",
    "recovered individuals are those who have recovered from the infection . in the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model@xcite , infected individuals can recover from the disease and become susceptible individuals again . while in the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model@xcite , infected individuals no longer get infected after recovery from the disease , which are assumed to get the permanent immunity . in classical epidemiology",
    ", a common assumption is that individuals in a class is treated similarly , and have equal probability to contact with everyone else@xcite .",
    "however , the recent abundance of data demonstrates that both the connectivity pattern and the contact rate are heterogeneous among real - world complex networks@xcite , which means the traditional deterministic differential equations and many other related results of epidemic processes are inadequate in real - world situations .",
    "this great stimulates the research of epidemics on real - world complex networks@xcite . due to the complexity of real - world networks ,",
    "the mean - field approach@xcite and the generating function approach@xcite are used to drive the analytic results of epidemics spreading .",
    "one of the remarkable results obtained by pastor - satorras and vespignani@xcite shows that in the limit of a network of infinite size , the epidemic threshold of the sis model tends to zero asymptotically in scale - free networks with power - law parameter in ( 2 , 3 ] . for sir model , it was found that in the thermodynamic limit , not only the threshold tends to vanish , but also the time for the stabilization of the infection becomes very small@xcite . by using the message - passing approach ,",
    "karrer and newman@xcite calculated the probabilities for any node and any time to be in state s , i , and r on tree structure .",
    "many other explicit results of sir model are obtained by mapping the sir model to the percolation process@xcite . also , effects of degree correlations@xcite , clustering@xcite , weights and directions of edges@xcite on epidemic spreading are broadly discussed . on the other hand ,",
    "various efficient immunization protocols@xcite have been designed for controlling the spread of epidemics on networks .",
    "recently much attention has been transferred to epidemic spreading in temporal and multiplex networks@xcite .",
    "addition to diseases or viruses , there are usually many other substances spreading in networks like information packets , goods , ideas , etc . , which depend on the specific types of the networks .",
    "epidemic spreading is often coupled with the delivery of these substances .",
    "for example , hiv spreads through the exchange of body fluids among individuals in contact networks .",
    "computer viruses spread with the delivery of information packets in computer networks .",
    "flu often spreads by air traffics among different spatial areas .",
    "therefore , understanding the mechanisms of these coupled spreading processes and how these processes affect each other is significant for designing efficient epidemic immunization strategies .",
    "meloni et al@xcite first studied the effects of traffic flow on epidemic spreading .",
    "they found that the epidemic threshold in the sis model decreases as flow increases , and emergence of traffic congestion slows down the spread of epidemics .",
    "then , yang et al@xcite further studied the relation between traffic dynamics and the sis epidemic model , and found that the epidemic can be controlled by fine tuning the local or global routing schemes .",
    "furthermore , they obtained that the epidemic threshold can be enhanced by cutting some specific edges in the network@xcite .",
    "the impacts of traffic dynamics on sir epidemic model havent been reported in literature . in this paper , we study the traffic - driven sir spreading dynamics in complex networks .",
    "we focus on the instantaneous size of infected population , and the final size of ever infected population . based on these two properties ,",
    "we study how the packets transmission process governed by given routing protocols affects the epidemic spreading .",
    "our model includes two coupled processes : packet delivery process and the epidemic spreading process .",
    "we will introduce our model in the context of computer networks .",
    "we assume that nodes in the network are identical which can generate , receive and deliver information packets .",
    "each node has a queue obeying the first - in - first - out ( fifo ) rule for storing packets .",
    "the length of the queue is set infinite .",
    "load of a node is the number of packets in its queue .",
    "every node generates packets at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "for example if @xmath2 , each time an arbitrary node generates one packet definitely and another one with probability 0.5 .",
    "the destination nodes of the packets are chosen randomly , and the packets will be removed from the network after arriving at the destination nodes .",
    "the transmission of packets is governed by the efficient routing protocol proposed by yan et al@xcite . for an arbitrary path @xmath3 of length @xmath4 between node @xmath5 and @xmath6 , denoted as @xmath7 , its routing cost is defined as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the degree of node @xmath10 , and @xmath0 is a control parameter .",
    "the sum runs over all the intermediate nodes of path @xmath3 .",
    "the efficient paths for delivering packets are defined to be those which have the minimum routing costs .",
    "if there are many efficient paths between two nodes , we randomly chose one for delivering packets . according to eq . 1",
    ", @xmath0 determines the routing cost of a path .",
    "when @xmath11 , paths with large - degree nodes usually have large routing costs .",
    "thus , efficient paths tend to be those paths composed of small - degree nodes when @xmath11 , and vice versa . each time a node can deliver at most @xmath12 packets .",
    "when @xmath13 , all the packets can be delivered without delay , there is no traffic congestion .",
    "the overall load of the network is constant after a short transient time .",
    "when @xmath12 is a constant value , there is a critical packet generation rate @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath15 , there is no traffic congestion .",
    "when @xmath16 , the network generates more packets than it can deliver .",
    "as a result , the overall load of the network increases with time , which is the traffic congestion phenomenon .",
    "we use the order parameter to characterize the traffic congestion , which is as follows@xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of packets in the network at time @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , the generated and delivered packets are balanced , and the network is under the free flow state . when @xmath21 , packets accumulate continuously in the network , which indicates that there exists traffic congestion .      as in the traditional sir model ,",
    "nodes in the network are divided into three classes : susceptible nodes , infected nodes and recovered nodes .",
    "initially , all the nodes in the network are susceptible nodes , which perform the normal function of generating , delivering , and receiving packets , and the network flow is stable",
    ". then we randomly select a node to be an infected one which is the original source of the infection .",
    "infected nodes generate infection packets instead of normal packets at each time step . with the delivery of these infection packets ,",
    "more and more susceptible nodes get infected after receiving the infection packets . infected nodes get recovered and become recovered nodes with probability @xmath22 at each time step . recovered nodes generate normal packets , and they can also make the infection packets into normal packets . thus , recovered nodes block the epidemic spreading .",
    "the epidemic spreading ends when all the infected nodes become recovered nodes .",
    "the transitions between the susceptible , infected , and recovered nodes for our model are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the underlying networks are random networks generated by the erds - rnyi ( er ) model@xcite and scale - free networks generated by the static model@xcite .",
    "also , some real - world networks@xcite are used in the simulations .",
    "we assume that , at time @xmath19 , the numbers of susceptible nodes , infected nodes and recovered nodes are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "first , we study the time evolution of our model on the er model , the static model , and the email network@xcite .",
    "we add the infection to the network at @xmath26 when the network is under free flow state , by randomly selecting a node to become infected . in figure 2 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )",
    ", we see that @xmath23 decreases with @xmath19 greatly , and then tends to be stable . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath25 increases with @xmath19 abruptly , and then converges at @xmath27 , which is the maximum number of recovered ( or ever infected ) node .",

    "@xmath29 reflects how intense the epidemic spreading is . at any time @xmath19 ,",
    "the sum of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 equals the size of the network .",

    "@xmath0 determines the efficient paths for the delivery of normal and infection packets . in figure 2(d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) , we see that @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 all vary with @xmath0 , and for any of the three , the trends of the curves of different @xmath0 are similar .",
    "we focus on the maximum instantaneous size of infected population @xmath29 , and the final size of ever infected population @xmath28 . in figure 3 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )",

    "to explain these results , we calculate the load variance @xmath31 of nodes , which is defined as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the load of node @xmath10 at time @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath34 is a constant value and is large enough to ensure accurate calculation of the average load @xmath35 of node @xmath10 .",

    "interestingly , the values of the optimal @xmath0 for @xmath36 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 are close , which indicates that homogeneous load distribution facilitates the epidemic spreading .",
    "there is also abrupt decrease in @xmath36 when @xmath0 is near zero .",
    "this is because the efficient paths are very different for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the load is abruptly redistributed from large - degree nodes to small - degree nodes when @xmath0 increases from below zero to above zero .",
    "this also accounts for the jumps in @xmath29 and @xmath28 .",

    "the peak of @xmath29 for @xmath40 is almost 6 times of the peak of @xmath29 for @xmath41 .",

    "when @xmath1 becomes large , infected nodes will generate more infected packets , which facilitates the epidemic spreading . in figure 5 ( b ) , we see that @xmath43 decreases with @xmath1 , which indicates an increase of dependency on large - degree nodes . to illustrate this , we focus on the top 1% largest degree nodes , and",
