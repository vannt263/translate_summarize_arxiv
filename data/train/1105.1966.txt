    "since its discovery , charmonium ( bound states ) has been proposed as a powerful tool to investigate many aspects of qcd such as the distribution of partons in protons and nuclei at large momentum transfer .",
    "charm quarks are predominantly produced in gluon interactions at , therefore they are sensitive to the gluon distribution in the nucleon and its modification in the nucleus . in addition , the color screening of the state makes charmonium dissociation an important signature for the formation of a deconfined state of matter created in a+a collisions@xcite .",
    "such studies rely on a accurate understanding of charmonium production in collisions which is the goal of the present work .",
    "the cross section of production is known from pqcd calculations to about a factor of two compared to phenix data  @xcite . however , the hadronization step which forms the bound state is a nonperturbative process and is not well understood . a variety of schemes have been proposed , some of the most common being the color evaporation model ( cem ) , the color singlet model ( csm ) and nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) , also known as the color octet model ( com ) .",
    "we review these models briefly here , and compare to them later in the text .    in the cem",
    "@xcite the bound - state production mechanism is insensitive to the quantum numbers .",
    "the pair is produced as long as the center of mass energy of the pair , @xmath9 , is greater than the mass of two charm quarks , but less than the mass of two open charm mesons .",
    "charmonium states are then color neutralized during the hadronization process by soft gluon emission .",
    "the yield of different charmonium states is a fixed fraction @xmath10 of the integrated pqcd cross section .",
    "@xmath10 is determined from experiments and is universal . hence in this model",
    ", the ratio between the yield of different charmonium states is momentum and energy independent .    in the csm",
    "@xcite the production amplitude of on - shell pairs is projected onto @xmath11 angular momentum states , and hence accounts for the and as @xmath12 and the states as @xmath13 .",
    "the model assumes that these charmonium states are formed in their final color singlet quantum number configuration .",
    "the production density matrix is coupled to the wave function at the origin which is determined from potential models .",
    "the only empirical parameters entering in the entire calculation are the leptonic decay width and the charmonium mass used in the potential model .",
    "nrqcd allows for the production of both color singlet and color octet states .",
    "color octet states emit one or more gluons during hadronization in order to neutralize their color .",
    "the production amplitude is expanded in powers of both the strong coupling , @xmath14 , and the velocity , @xmath15 , of the heavy quarks relative to the pair .",
    "the expansion in @xmath15 assumes that the heavy quark is nonrelativistic . 0.23(0.1)@xmath16 . ] as in the csm , the production amplitudes are projected onto @xmath11 states . since the potential model can only be applied to the color singlet state , a long range nonperturbative matrix element for each quarkonium state is fitted from experiments .",
    "the earliest such matrix parametrization @xcite was tuned with and cross sections observed in cdf @xcite which indicated that while p - wave charmonium ( ) has no important color octet state contributions , s - wave charmonium ( direct and ) production is largely through color octet channels .",
    "therefore , this model is sometimes simply referred to as the color octet model ( com ) .",
    "each model has its strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the cem is able to reasonably describe quarkonia yields observed in many experiments , but has no predictive power for polarization .",
    "cross sections calculated using csm grossly underestimate the yields observed at phenix @xcite and at cdf @xcite .",
    "recent next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite and next - to - next - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite calculations for the color singlet states resulted in significant modifications of the predicted charmonium yields and polarization , but not sufficient to agree with the experimental results .",
    "nrqcd tuned with and  spectra from cdf was able to qualitatively describe the first phenix cross section and polarization results @xcite albeit with large experimental uncertainties , but failed to describe the and polarization observed in cdf @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "recent nrqcd calculations @xcite include color singlet and color octet nlo short range terms along with a long - range matrix parametrization from experimental hadroproduction @xcite and photoproduction @xcite of mesons . however , the nlo terms for the color octet @xcite have only small corrections compared to the leading - order ( lo ) terms and the calculations still disagree with the polarization measured by cdf .",
    "one of the complications in the total cross section and polarization calculations ( observables where experimental tests are readily available ) is the contribution from the decays of excited charmonium states , primarily , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the suppression observed in heavy ion collisions can not be completely understood without a knowledge of the feed - down fraction of excited charmonium state decays to the .",
    "this is particularly true under the assumption that the suppression is due to the disassociation of charmonium in the a high temperature quark - gluon plasma , since lattice calculations @xcite indicate that the melting points of the and states are lower than that of the . in this work the feed - down fractions to the from excited charmonium states",
    "is measured since they can be determined more precisely than production cross sections as many of the systematic uncertainties cancel when making cross section ratios .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic can measure quarkonia dilepton decays over a broad  and rapidity range and can detect photons from radiative decays using electromagnetic calorimeters at midrapidity .",
    "this article reports on the feed - down fraction of the yield which comes from and decays at midrapidity in collisions at . for these we used the to yield ratio in the dielectron channel and the full reconstruction of the @xmath19 decay . a new differential cross section measurement at midrapidity and forward rapidity using the increased luminosity obtained in the 2006 and 2008 runs , is also presented .",
    "these provide more accurate measurements than previously published in @xcite , particularly for the differential cross section at high  .",
    "the results obtained in these analyses also provide a baseline for the study of suppression in @xmath20+au @xcite and au+au @xcite collisions at phenix .",
    "systematic uncertainties throughout this article are classified according to whether or not there are point - to - point correlations between the uncertainties . type a systematic uncertainties are point - to - point uncorrelated , similar to statistical uncertainties , since the points fluctuate randomly with respect to each other .",
    "type b systematic uncertainties are point - to - point correlated .",
    "the points fluctuate coherently with respect to each other .",
    "that is , it accounts for the uncertainty in the nth - order derivative of the measured spectrum , in most cases the slope .",
    "global , or type c , systematics are those where all points fluctuate in the same direction and by the same fractional amount .",
    "the remainder of the article is arranged as follows .",

    "two forward muon arms measure muons over the range @xmath22 arm and @xmath23 with full azimuthal coverage .    charged particle tracks in the central arms are formed using the drift chamber ( dch ) , the pad chamber ( pc ) and the collision point .",
    "electron candidates required at least one fired phototube within an annulus centered on the projected track position on the ring imaging erenkov detector ( rich).mrad and @xmath24 cm ] in addition , the electron candidate is required to be associated with an energy cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) that falls within 4@xmath25 of the projected track position , and within 4@xmath26 of the expected energy / momentum ratio where the @xmath27 s characterize the position and energy resolution of the emcal .",
    "the relatively loose association requirement still provides excellent hadron rejection due to the very small particle multiplicity in collisions .",
    "based on the  range of decay electrons from observed in real data and simulations , a minimum @xmath7 of 500 mev/@xmath16 was also required for each electron candidate .",
    "each of the forward muon arms@xcite comprises a hadron absorber , three stations of cathode strip chambers for particle tracking ( mutr ) , and a muon identifier detector ( muid ) .",
    "the hadron absorber is composed of a 20 cm thick copper nosecone and 60 cm of iron which is part of the magnet .",
    "the mutr is installed in an eight - sided conical magnet .",
    "the muid is composed of five steel hadron absorbers interleaved with six panels of vertical and horizontal iarocci tubes .",

    "the minimum emcal energy requirement was 400 mev for the first half of the run and 600 mev for the second half .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken with the ert in coincidence with the mb trigger .",
    "events were also triggered when there were two muon candidates in one of the muid arms .",
    "the trigger logic for a muon candidate required a `` road '' of fired iarocci tubes in at least four planes , including in the most downstream plane relative to the collision point . the event sample used in the dimuon analysis required a muid trigger in coincidence with the mb trigger .",
    "there are events which produce a but do not fire the mb trigger .",
    "the fraction , @xmath36,of such events is estimated by measuring the number of high @xmath7 @xmath37 decays which satisfy the minimum energy condition of the ert and which do not satisfy the mb trigger .",
    "it was found that @xmath38 .",
    "the correction due to this factor is included in all cross section calculations for measurements requiring the mb trigger .",
    "no dependence of @xmath36 on the @xmath7 of the measured @xmath39 decays was found over the range 0 - 10 @xcite .    the collision point along the beam direction",
    "is determined with a resolution of 1.5 cm by using the difference between the fastest time signals measured in the north and south bbc detectors .",
    "the collision point was required to be within @xmath630 cm of the nominal center of the detector . in the dielectron analysis , runs in which electron yields were more than three standard deviations away from the average in at least one of the eight emcal azimuthal sectors , were discarded . for the dimuon analysis , runs where the muon arm spectrometers were not fully operational were rejected .",
