    "[ fig : ratio ] , we also see that the positive @xmath40 model ( more large scale power ) does worse .",
    "the fitting formula of @xcite  performs the same task as the pd formula in that , given a wavenumber @xmath20 and redshift @xmath138 , it provides an estimate of the non - linear power spectrum @xmath139 .",
    "the smith formula is inspired by the halo model : it breaks up the non - linear power into two pieces , a quasi - linear term and a one - halo like term .",
    "we adapted the smith formula for use with alternative gravity by using the ag linear spectrum , but we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : smithpd ] that pd is a much better fit to the data for negative @xmath40 ( for the positive-@xmath40 model that we have tested , the smith and pd fits are comparable at low redshift ) .",
    "this may be due to the use of two separate terms in the smith formula , one of which is calibrated on the basis of the shapes of cdm halos in standard gravity . it was designed and tested for simulations with scale - free initial spectra or cdm initial conditions , but not for initial spectra with a very different shape , such as those produced by a scale - dependent growth factor , initial conditions with a shape like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : altics ] .    to summarize",
    ", our results suggest that the nonlinear power spectrum in alternative gravity models is captured completely by the change in the linear growth factor .",
    "this result is consistent with the approach used in the pd fitting function .",
    "a similar result is shown in the recent study of @xcite , who found that nonlinear spectra for a class of dark energy models can be accurately described by appropriate choice of length and time scales .",
    "we must emphasize , however , that our results are only valid for a certain range of scales .",
    "we can estimate over what range our results should be valid by examining what happens to the comoving scale @xmath41 and the nonlinear scale as the simulation progresses .",
    "the comoving wavenumber corresponding to @xmath41 is defined by @xmath140 . for a @xmath141  mpc model ,",
    "[ fig : alpha_models_rs_z ] shows how the wavenumber @xmath142 ranges from approximately 1.3  mpc@xmath1 at the present to 0.16  mpc@xmath1 at @xmath143 . inspection also reveals that the nonlinear wavenumber @xmath144 ( the scale where the linear and nonlinear spectra begin to diverge ) ranges from approximately @xmath145  mpc@xmath1 at the present to @xmath146  mpc@xmath1 at @xmath143 for the @xmath147 , @xmath141  mpc model .",
    "so we see that @xmath41 actually starts out larger than @xmath148 , but ends up well inside the nonlinear scale as time goes by ; the redshift where they coincide depends on the values of @xmath41 and alpha chosen , for @xmath147 , @xmath141  mpc one can see that it occurs at about @xmath149 , whereas for the @xmath150 , @xmath129  mpc model , the scales cross later at a redshift of around @xmath151 .",
    "as long as the boxsize and resolution of our simulations can adequately capture the dynamics of @xmath41 and @xmath148 over a range of redshifts , i.e.  for any model where the nonlinear scale and @xmath41 cross well before redshift @xmath38 , the conclusions we reach from our simulation should be valid ; we estimate that this would be true for a range of @xmath41 at least from about 1  mpc to 20  mpc .",
    "it is interesting that quasilinear perturbation theory @xcite would have suggested some departures from this universality : equations for the second order density and velocity fields contain the linear fields as well as the @xmath152 term in the euler equation .",
    "so the dependence of the second order terms on the scale dependent function @xmath153 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gk ] ) would not be completely determined by the linear solution .",
    "our results show that this quasilinear departure is likely very small",
    ". generally speaking , the halo model description , assuming it describes alternative gravity models , is consistent with universality : halo bias , the linear spectrum and halo mass function depend only on the linear growth and initial power spectrum .",
    "since the small scales where halo structure may play a role are not well probed by our simulations , it is not surprising that we find an approximate universality in the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "the pd formula gives results close to the halo model for @xmath12cdm @xcite .",
    "we have performed n - body simulations of large scale structure formation with a modified newtonian potential in a @xmath12cdm background .",
    "this is intended to approximate alternative gravity theories that are designed to match the observed acceleration of the universe .",
    "we focus on the quasilinear and non - linear regime of clustering at low redshift .",
    "our simulations resolve the 3d power spectrum of matter on scales of @xmath461.0  mpc@xmath1 .",
    "we used the 3d simulations to compute the weak lensing power spectrum over angular wavenumbers @xmath1541000 .",
    "we used a technique for this that reduces the scatter in measurements from simulations ( described in section 3.3 ) .",
    "the range of scales we studied is expected to be observable with high accuracy with planned surveys .",
    "the nonlinear modification of the power spectra ranges from @xmath155 effects in the quasilinear regime to an order of magnitude at the small scale end .",
    "while the accuracy of our simulated spectra is typically @xmath155 over this range , the relative accuracy for predictions of different gravity models is significantly better .",
    "we find that nonlinear effects propagate the difference between the power spectra to scales where the linear spectra are nearly identical .",
    "this is the expected effect of mode coupling in nonlinear gravitational evolution @xcite .",
    "the result is that at scales of @xmath156  mpc@xmath1 , the modified gravity power spectra differ by over 10@xmath157 , while the linear spectra are within 5@xmath157 .",
    "similar differences are seen in the weak lensing spectra at @xmath158 , and if the potential for photons is modified in a similar way as the potential for matter , the effects reinforce each other and the differences in the weak lensing spectra are much larger .",
    "these scales are of great interest because the observational errors are expected to be small and theoretical interpretation can be made without modeling of non - gravitational effects ( at least for the lensing spectra ) .",
    "we compare the differences between models to the expected statistical errors from a wide area lensing survey to show that it should be possible to directly constrain the parameters of an alternative gravity scenario .",
    "models within the 2-@xmath159 limits of current galaxy surveys would be easily distinguished by future lensing measurements .",
    "a detailed study of this is left for future work .",
    "our results are consistent with a universality in nonlinear gravity , which makes the nonlinear power spectrum a function only of the initial ( gaussian ) conditions and linear growth , for modifications on length scales for which there are likely to be precise observations in the near future .",
    "we find that the lensing and 3d power spectra can not distinguish between simulations which were started with appropriately modified initial conditions and evolved with standard gravity , and those which were evolved with a modified gravitational potential .",
    "this means that for observationally accessible scales , there is a degeneracy between the shape of the potential used to evolve the simulation and the shape of the initial conditions . for simple modified gravity models ,",
    "it means that another constraint on the primordial power spectrum ( such as the cmb ) , or measurements at multiple redshifts , must be used to test for modified gravity .",
    "it may also be that the structure of dark matter halos , not well probed by our simulations , are different for ag models .",
    "this is an interesting topic for future work with higher resolution simulations .",
    "the skewness or bispectrum may also help distinguish alternative gravity models , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , since its dependence on the scale dependent function @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gk ] ) is different .",
    "we tested analytical approximations to the nonlinear spectra for modified gravity models .",
    "we found that while the peacock - dodds fitting formula was accurate to 1020% in comparison to the simulated spectra , its relative accuracy between different models is significantly better and within the errors of our measurements .",
    "the smith et al .",
    "formula does somewhat worse for the models studied .",
    "our simulations are a useful first step in studying the effects that an alternative gravity model has on large scale structure formation",
    ". it would be of great interest to simulate the dynamics of a full alternative gravity theory , instead of our approach ( which may be a convenient approximation but is not even covariant ) .",
    "however , a full alternative gravity theory that one can simulate is hard to come by ; e.g. going beyond the linear regime for the dgp model @xcite , even in the quasilinear regime , is an unsolved problem .",
    "our n - body simulations used the code kindly made public by anatoly klypin .",
    "we thank derek dolney for his help and contributions in running the numerical simulations .",
