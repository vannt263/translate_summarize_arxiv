    "global helioseismology has proven very successful at inferring large scale properties of the sun ( for a review , see ; ) . because they are very robust",
    ", the extension of methods of global helioseismology to study localized variations in the structure and dynamics of the solar interior has been of some interest ( e.g. )",
    ". however , the precise sensitivities of global modes to local perturbations are difficult to estimate through analytical means , especially in cases where the flows or thermal asphericities of interest possess complex spatial dependencies . to address questions relating to sensitivities and with the hope of perhaps discovering hitherto unknown phenomena associated with global modes , we introduce here for the first time a technique to study the effects of arbitrary perturbations on global mode parameters in the linear limit of small wave amplitudes .",
    "global modes attain resonant frequencies as a consequence of differentially sampling the entire region of propagation , making it somewhat more difficult ( in comparison to local helioseismology ) to pinpoint local thermal asphericities at depth .",
    "exactly how difficult is one of the questions we have attempted to answer in this article .",
    "jets in the tachocline ( e.g. ) are a subject of considerable interest since their existence ( or lack thereof ) could be very important in understanding the angular momentum balance of the sun .",
    "studying the sensitivities and signatures of waves to flows at depth may open up possibilities for their detection .",
    "forward modeling as a means of studying wave interactions in a complex medium like the sun has become quite favoured ( e.g. ; ; ; ) .",
    "the discovery of interesting phenomena , especially in the realm of local helioseismology ( e.g. ; ) , adds motivation to the pursuit of direct calculations . with the application of noise subtraction @xcite",
    ", we can now study the signatures of a wide range of perturbations in a realistic multiple source picture . here",
    ", we attempt to place bounds on the detectability of thermal asphericities at various depths in the sun .",
    "we introduce and discuss the method of simulation with a description of the types of perturbations introduced in the model in section [ simulations.sec ] .",
    "the estimation of mode parameters can prove somewhat difficult due to restrictions on the temporal length of the simulation ( @xmath4 hours ; owing to the expensive nature of the computation ) .",
    "the data analysis techniques used to characterize the modes are presented in section [ peakbag.sec ] .",
    "we then discuss the results from the analyses of the simulated data in @xmath5[results.sec ] and summarize this work in @xmath5[conclusions.sec ] .",
    "the linearized 3d euler equations in spherical geometry are solved in the manner described in .",
    "the computational domain is a spherical shell extending from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , with damping sponges placed adjacent to the upper and lower radial boundaries to allow the absorption of outgoing waves .",
    "the background stratification is a convectively stabilized form of model s @xcite ; only the highly ( convectively ) unstable near - surface layers ( @xmath8 ) are altered while the interior is the same as model s. waves are stochastically excited over a 200 km thick sub - photospheric spherical envelope , through the application of a dipolar source function in the vertical ( radial ) momentum equation @xcite .",
    "the forcing function is uniformly distributed in spherical harmonic space @xmath9 ; in frequency , a solar - like power variation is imposed .",
    "any damping of the wave modes away from the boundaries is entirely of numerical origin .",
    "the radial velocities associated with the oscillations are extracted 200 km above the photosphere and used as inputs to the peakbagging analyses .",
    "data over the entire 360@xmath10 extent of the sphere are utilized in the analyses , thus avoiding issues related to mode leakage .",
    "we show an example power spectrum in figure  [ power.spectrum ] along with the fits .",
    "the technique of realization noise subtraction ( e.g. ) is extensively applied in this work . due to the relatively short time lengths of the simulations ( the shortest time series",
    "yet that we have worked with is 500 minutes long ! ) , the power spectrum is not highly resolved and it would seem that the resulting uncertainty in the mode parameter fits might constrain our ability to study small perturbations . to beat this limit , we perform two simulations with identical realizations of the forcing function : a ` quiet ' run with no perturbations , and a ` perturbed ' run that contains the anomaly of interest",
    ". fits to the mode parameters in these two datasets are then subtracted , thus removing nearly all traces of the realization and retaining only effects arising due to mode - perturbation interactions ( see section  [ peakbag.sec ] ) . as an example , we show in figure  [ noise.subtract ] how a localized sound - speed perturbation placed at the bottom of the convection zone scatters waves which then proceed to refocus at the antipode ( the principle of farside holography , ) . the presence of the sound - speed perturbation is not seen in panel a , whereas it is clearly seen in the noise - subtracted images of panels b and c.    in these calculations , we only consider time - stationary perturbations . the sound - speed perturbations are taken to be solely due to changes in the first adiabatic index , @xmath11 ; we do not study sound - speed variations arising from changes in the background pressure or density since altering these variables can create hydrostatic instabilities .",
    "lastly , the amplitude of all perturbations are taken to be much smaller than the local sound speed ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "our first round of peakbagging is done on the @xmath1-averaged power spectrum for the quiet simulation . for each @xmath13 that we attempt to fit , we search for peaks in the negative second derivative of the power . unlike the power itself , which has a background , the second derivative has the advantage of having an approximately zero baseline .",
    "the search is accomplished by finding the frequency at which the maximum value of the negative second derivative occurs , estimating the mode parameters using a frequency window of width 100 @xmath14hz centered on this peak frequency , zeroing the negative second derivative in this interval , and iterating .",
    "if the range of power in the frequency window is not above a certain threshold , we check the peak frequency found ; if it is too close to a frequency found on a previous iteration , that maximum is rejected , the same interval is again zeroed , and iteration continues .",
    "note that such a simple algorithm is feasible only because simulation data contains no leaks .",
    "once we have found as many peaks as possible with this procedure , we assign a value of @xmath15 to each one based on a model computed using adipack @xcite .    the next step is to perform an actual fit to the power spectrum in the vicinity of each peak we identified .",
    "for the line profile we use a lorentzian of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total power , @xmath18 is the half width at half maximum , @xmath19 is the peak frequency , and @xmath20 is the background power . the initial guesses for these parameters are obtained in the first step as follows : @xmath20 is set to the minimum value of the power in the frequency window around the peak , @xmath17 is set to the integral under the power curve minus @xmath20 times the width of the window , and @xmath18 is set to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maximum value of the power in the frequency window .",
    "the fitting interval extends halfway to the adjacent peaks , or 100 @xmath14hz beyond the peak frequency of the modes at the edge .",
    "the fitting itself is done using the idl routine ` curvefit ` .",
    "once we have fit these mode parameters for the @xmath1-averaged spectrum , we use them as the initial guesses for fitting the individual @xmath1 spectra .",
    "then for each @xmath13 and @xmath15 we can fit a set of @xmath2-coefficients to the frequencies as functions of @xmath23 .",
    "although for the quiet sun we would expect for all the @xmath2-coefficients to be zero , this calculation is still necessary in order to perform the noise subtraction .",
    "we also use the mode parameters from the @xmath1-averaged spectrum of the quiet simulation as initial guesses for fitting the ( unshifted ) @xmath1-averaged spectrum of the perturbed simulation .",
    "although the perturbations may lift the degeneracy in @xmath1 , we expect the splitting to be very small , so that the peaks in the @xmath1-averaged spectrum can still be well represented by a lorentzian .",
    "we also use those same initial guesses for fitting the individual @xmath1 spectra of the perturbed simulation , and recalculate the @xmath2-coefficients .",
    "an empirical estimate of the error in frequency differences for the sound - speed perturbation at @xmath24 ( see section  [ sound.speed.anomalies ] ) is computed in the following manner .",
    "we look at the difference in mode parameters only for those modes that do not penetrate to the depth of the perturbation ( all modes with @xmath25 ) .",
    "we then make a histogram of these differences with a bin size of 0.001 @xmath14hz and fit a gaussian to the resulting distribution . with this method",
    "we find a standard deviation of 0.000474 @xmath14hz or 0.47 nhz .",
    "this result is confirmed by also computing the standard deviation of 95% of the closest points to the mean .",
    "we place three perturbations of horizontal size @xmath26 ( in longitude and latitude ) with a full width at half maximum in radius of 2@xmath27 ( 13.9 mm ) at depths of @xmath28 , each with an amplitude @xmath29 of @xmath30% of the local sound speed .",
    "because of the fixed angular size , the perturbations grow progressively smaller in physical size with depth ; our intention was to keep the perturbation as localized and non - spherically symmetric as possible .",
    "despite the fact that the perturbation is highly sub - wavelength ( the wavelength at @xmath24 is @xmath31 mm or @xmath32 ) , we notice that for these ( relatively ) small amplitude anomalies , the global mode frequency shifts are predominantly a function of the spherically symmetric component of the spatial structure of the perturbation . in other words ,",
    "what matters most is the contribution from the @xmath33 coefficient in the spherical harmonic expansion of the horizontal spatial structure of the perturbation .",
    "we verify this by computing the frequency shifts associated with a spherically symmetric area - averaged version of the localized perturbation ( with an amplitude of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the solid angle subtended by the localized perturbation , 0.05 referring to the 5% increase in sound speed ) .",
    "we were careful to ensure that the radial dependence of the magnitude of the perturbation was unchanged .",
    "the frequency shifts associated with the spherically symmetric perturbations were calculated independently through simulation and the oscillation frequency package , adipack @xcite and seen to match accurately , as shown in figure  [ sound.speeds ] .",
    "because of the non - spherically symmetric nature of the perturbation , we expect to see shifts in the @xmath2-coefficients .",
    "similarly , it is likely that there will be slight deviations in the amplitudes of modes that propagate in regions close to and below the locations of the perturbation .",
    "we display these effects for the case with the perturbation located at @xmath36 in figure  [ mode.parameters.fig ] .",
    "we introduce a non - dimensional measure , @xmath37 , to characterize the degree of scattering exhibited by the anomaly : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , the amplitude of the sound - speed perturbation expressed in fractions of the local sound speed , @xmath17 the angular area of the perturbation , and @xmath40 the number of modes in the summation term .",
    "essentially , this parameter tells us how strongly perturbations couple with the wave field , with larger @xmath37 implying a greater degree of scatter and vice versa .",
    "because it is independent of perturbation size or magnitude , @xmath37 can be extended to study flow perturbations as well .",
    "this measure is meaningful only in the regime where the frequency shifts are presumably linear functions of the perturbation magnitude .",
    "also , it is expected that @xmath37 will retain a strong dependence on the radial location of the perturbation since different parts of the spectrum see different regions of the sun .",
    "for example , placing an anomaly at the surface will likely affect the entire spectrum of global modes , as seen in figure  [ sound.speeds]c .",
    "results for @xmath37 shown in table  [ t - scatter ] contain no surprises ; for a given size and magnitude of the perturbation , the effect on the global frequencies increases strongly with its location in radius .",
    "the signature of a perturbation at the bottom of the convection zone on the global modes is twice as strong as an anomaly in the radiative interior ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the surface perturbation is a little more difficult to compare with the others because contrary to the two deeper perturbations , it is locally far larger than the wavelengths of the modes .",
    "the result however is in line with expectation ; the near - surface scatterer is far more potent than the other two anomalies .",
    ".the scattering extents @xmath37 , of various perturbations . the root mean square ( rms ) variation in frequencies",
    "is shown as well . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "we have introduced a method to systematically study the effects of various local perturbations on global mode frequencies .",
    "techniques of mode finding and parameter fitting are applied to artificial data obtained from simulations of wave propagation in a solar - like stratified spherical shell .",
    "we are able to beat the issue of poor frequency resolution by extending the method of realization noise subtraction @xcite to global mode analysis .",
    "these methods can prove very useful in the study of shifts due to perturbations of magnitudes beyond the scope of first order perturbation theory ; moreover , extending this approach to investigate systematic frequency shifts in other stars may prove exciting .",
    "we are currently studying the impact of complex flows like convection and localized jets on the global frequencies .",
    "preliminary results seem to indicate that flows are stronger scatterers ( larger @xmath37 ) than sound - speed perturbations although more work needs to be done to confirm and characterize these effects .",
