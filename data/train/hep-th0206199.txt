    "quantum corrections to classical solutions like kinks @xcite and spontaneous symmetry breaking are a fields of intensive study and have applications in many branches of theoretical physics ranging from the standard model to solid state .",
    "recent interest appeared from some subtleties connected with supersymmetry @xcite . a number of models is usually considered in this connection .",
    "the most popular ones are the @xmath0-model and the sine - gordon model .",
    "they result in a scattering problem for the quantum fluctuations with reflectionless potentials . as a result calculations of quantum corrections to the mass become very explicite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the question which models result in a reflectionless scattering potential .",
    "the surprising result is that all of them are very similar to the above mentioned ones .",
    "the setup of the problem is as follows .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath1 in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions with action [ s ] s[]=12 dxdt ( ( _ ) ^2+u()^2 ) . if the squared potential , @xmath2 , has two ( or more ) minima of equal depth occurs and topological nontrivial kink solutions @xmath3 exist . in order to calculate the quantum fluctuations @xmath4 in the background of the kink one has to solve the scattering problem for the potential @xmath5 which appears from the second derivative @xmath6 / \\delta \\phi_k^2(x)$ ] of the action ,",
    "see below eq . .",
    "in simple models like the mentioned above this potential @xmath5 is reflectionless .    in the present paper",
    "we try to describe all potentials @xmath7 in which correspond to a reflectionless scattering potential @xmath5 and calculate the corresponding classical energy and the quantum energy @xmath8 which is the ground state energy of the field @xmath9 in the background of @xmath3 .",
    "in calculating these quantities it is usually assumed that the potential @xmath7 is given .",
    "after that one solves the scattering problem related to @xmath5 and calculates the energies and @xmath8 . in the paper @xcite the inverse approach had been proposed .",
    "one starts from the solution of the scattering problem given in terms of the so called scattering data @xmath10 known since @xcite to be in a one - to - one correspondence with the potential @xmath5 ( for a representation of these questions see @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "@xmath11 is the reflection coefficient , @xmath12 are the bound state energies and @xmath13 are numbers connected with the normalization of the bound state wave functions . as shown in @xcite the ground state energy can be expressed in a simple way in terms of the scattering data even including the necessary renormalization , see eq .",
    "below . in order to find the classical energy one has to restore the potential @xmath5 from the scattering data .",
    "this is the so called inverse scattering problem which was solved in terms of certain integral equations ( see , again , @xcite ) . in this way , solving the inverse scattering problem the classical energy can be calculated from the scattering data . in @xcite",
    "it was shown how this procedure works on the simplest example of reflectionless ( @xmath14 ) scattering data containing only one bound state .    in the present paper",
    "we use this inverse approach to describe all potentials @xmath7 corresponding to reflectionless scattering data and having topologically nontrivial solutions allowing in this way for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it turns out that not all scattering data correspond to such potentials @xmath7 but only certain classes .",
    "so we can formulate the reconstruction problem : find the mapping between scattering data and potentials @xmath7 allowing for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "a special consideration deserve the so called rational scattering data . here",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath11 is a rational function of @xmath15 thus given by a finite number of parameters . for a rational @xmath11",
    "the inverse scattering problem is known to have an explicite , algebraic solution ( in a similar way as in the reflectionless case ) and the classical energy can be obtained then by integration .",
    "in addition , the rational scattering data form a dense subset in the set of all scattering data . in this way , the inverse approach may provide an approximation scheme for the general case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we consider soliton potentials providing completely explicite formulas . in the third section we consider scattering data given by two bound states . in the fourth section",
    "we show how this can be generalized to the general reflectionless case .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",

    "static solutions @xmath19 are subject to the equation of motion @xmath20 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 has at least two minima of equal depth and we are free to denote two neighbored ones by @xmath22 .",
    "these fields , @xmath23 , are the vacuum solutions . in case @xmath24 there",
    "exist topological nontrivial solutions @xmath3 called kink solutions which interpolate between the vacuum solutions by means of @xmath25 .",
    "these solutions obey the bogomolny equations [ be ] _k(x)=u(_k(x ) ) and have the classical energy [ ecl0]e_class=12 _ -^dx ( ( _k(x))^2+u^2(_k(x ) ) ) which by means of eq .",
    "can be written in the form [ ecl]e_class=_-^dx u^2(_k(x ) ) . in order to have a finite energy of the kink we must assume that the potential @xmath26 is zero in its minima .",
    "the quantization of the scalar field in the background of the kink solution by means of the shift [ dec](x , t)=_k(x)+(x , t ) delivers in the gaussian approximation the action [ seta]s_fluct.[]=12dx  dt ( x , t)(_t^2-_x^2+^2+v(x))(x , t ) for the fluctuations where the potential @xmath5 results from [ v2 ] 12_| _ = _",

    "we follow here the treatment in @xcite . for a discussion of the relations to different renormalization schemes we refer to @xcite where , for instance",
    ", the equivalence of the subtraction scheme based on the heat kernel expansion and the mass renormalization with the no tadpole condition had been shown .    in terms of the scattering data",
    "the renormalized ground state energy can be written in the form @xcite [ e0r]e_0&=&_0^ + & & -_i=1^n(_i-  ) . here , the @xmath12 are the binding energies of the bound states in the potential @xmath5 , [ sce](-^2_x+v(x))_i(x)=-_i^2 _ i(x ) , where the @xmath32 are the corresponding eigenfunctions . these are bound state wave functions and they are normalizable , @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath11 is the reflection coefficient and both , @xmath12 and @xmath11 belong to the scattering data .",
    "it should be underlined that in @xmath29 , eq . , the divergences are subtracted .",
    "this resulted in this quite simple form because the heat kernel coefficients could be expressed in terms of the scattering data .",
    "a nice consequence which can be read off from this formula is that the ground state energy is always negative .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the problem of calculating quantum corrections can be inverted .",
    "one starts from the scttering data and by means of eq .",
    "the quantum corrections can be obtained by simple integration .",
    "the price one has to pay is a more complicated procedure to obtain the classical energy .",
    "one has to solve the inverse scattering problem , i.e. , one has to reconstruct the potential @xmath5 from the scattering data .",
    "this problem had been intensively studied in connection with the solution of nonlinear evolution equations in the 70ies .",
    "the last step in this procedure is then to restore the potential @xmath26 from @xmath5 using eq . and finally to calculate the classical energy from eq . .",
    "in following this general procedure we make use of eq . and the bogomolny equation .",
    "differentiating eq . twice with respect to @xmath34 we obtain [ y](x)=((u(x))^2 + u(x)u(x))(x ) . by means of eq . and with the notation @xmath35 we rewrite this equation in the form [ y1](-_x^2+v(x))(x)=-^2 ( x ) .",
    "this equation shows that the derivative of the kink is a bound state solution of the scattering problem associated with the potential @xmath5 and that the mass @xmath27 of the fluctuating field @xmath4 in eq .",
    "is the corresponding binding energy , i.e. , one of the @xmath12 s in the scattering data .",
    "note that @xmath36 in eq . can not be a scattering solution because in that case @xmath37 would be negative .",

    "the potential @xmath26 can be restored simply as [ ueta0]u(_k(x))=(x ) .",
    "note that the potential @xmath26 can be restored only from the ground state wave function of the scattering potential @xmath5 because it is only this function which does not have zeros . in case @xmath36",
    "vanishes for some finite @xmath34 , the function @xmath39 would do so in contradiction to our assumption that two neighbored zeros correspond to @xmath38 .    in this way , by means of equations and we obtained a parametric representation of the potential @xmath26 in terms of the ground state wave function @xmath36 .",
    "we note that this representation covers the region with @xmath40 $ ] . how to go beyond we consider in the following sections .",
    "there is a freedom in the parametric representation , eqs . , .",
    "the ground state wave function , @xmath36 , which we obtain as a solution of the inverse scattering problem is determined up to a multiplicative factor , which has the meaning of the normalization of @xmath36 only .",
    "so we are free to multiply the function @xmath36 by a constant , @xmath41 .",
    "after that we can assume @xmath36 to be normalized , @xmath42 .",
    "in doing so we express @xmath43 from eq .",
    "as @xmath44 in this way the freedom in the normalization of @xmath36 is expressed in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "after this rescaling we rewrite eqs . and in the final form [ feta]_k(x)=-_vac+ 2_vac _ -^x d  ( ) and [ ueta]u(_k(x))=2_vac  ( x ) .",
    "using the last line we obtain from eq . the classical energy which is the quantity we are interested in , [ ecleta ] e_class= 4_vac^2  _ -^dx",

    "however , it should be noticed that this is merely a formal solution .",
    "we restored @xmath26 for a restricted range of @xmath17 only .",
    "we have to construct a continuation to all values of @xmath17 which must deliver a single valued function @xmath26 having the necessary extrema in order to allow for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the investigation of this property is the main difficulty in the restoration problem .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the free parameters .",
    "first of all there are the scattering data which constitute a set of independent parameters .",
    "second , we have the vacuum solution , @xmath45 , which is in fact the condensate of the field @xmath17 . as seen from the above formulas there is no more freedom in the restoration process .",
    "together with the uniqueness of the restoration of @xmath36 from the scattering data the above mentioned parameters are the only independent ones . as for the dimensions we note that @xmath45 is dimensionless ( we work in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ) and that the bound state levels @xmath12 have the dimension of a mass . for reflectionless",
    "scattering data these are the only dimensional parameters and a rescaling @xmath46 results in @xmath47 . in the remaining paper of the paper we put the mass scale equal to one .",
    "in this section we consider the case of reflectionless scattering data ( @xmath14 ) given by @xmath48 bound states with energy levels [ sollab]_i = i ( i=1,2,  ,n ) . here",

    "the potential @xmath5 belonging to these scattering date is well known , [ vn]v(x)=. the solutions @xmath36 of eq .",

    "the ground state wave function reads [ etan](x)= and the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath50 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath51 is defined from @xmath42 and will be calculated later in eq . .",
    "we call these @xmath5 soliton potentials because they are related to the soliton solutions of the korteweg - de - vries equation .    now , in order to solve the restoration problem we first consider even @xmath48 .",

    "if it changes it sign the function @xmath60 is not monotonous and , as a consequence , @xmath26 is not single valued . if , in contrary , there is no change in the sign , @xmath60 is monoton . finally from the remark that @xmath60 is a polynomial in @xmath59 the coverage of the whole region for @xmath17 follows .",

    "in this example we see explicitely how the continuation beyond the initial region works .",
    "the reason that it works at all is that we assumed the potential @xmath26 to be a function of @xmath17 and not a more general object like , for instance , a functional .",

    "<S> only certain sets of reflectionless scattering data correspond to symmetry breaking and all restored potentials are similar either to the phi**4-model or to the sine - gordon model . </S>"
