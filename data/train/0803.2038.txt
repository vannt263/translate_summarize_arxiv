    "charge - density wave ( cdw ) phenomena have been detected in a number of superconducting cuprates .",
    "most prominent are the uni - directional spin and charge modulations , termed `` stripes '' , in la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5  and la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5  ( with nd or eu co - doping ) , being strongest near 1/8th doping.@xcite in other cuprates , notably bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2  and ca@xmath3na@xmath4cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements have found signatures of short - range charge order.@xcite .    remarkably , the existence of stripe states was postulated in early theory work on the hubbard model,@xcite far before experimental indications for such phases were found .",
    "later on , ideas of frustrated phase separation as driving force of stripe formation were worked out in detail,@xcite and cdw quantum criticality was proposed as source of both non - fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity.@xcite for the vast number of subsequent theoretical activities we refer to the review articles ref .  .",
    "while the role of charge order for the overall properties of cuprates is under debate , a plausible hypothesis is that tendencies toward charge ordering are common to underdoped cuprates.@xcite even compounds not displaying long - range order are influenced by the proximity to a charge - ordered state .",
    "in particular , impurities will act as random - field pinning centers for the collective charge modes , leading to static short - range order ( as observed in stm).@xcite moreover , charge order will influence the magnetic excitations , believed to be the pairing glue:@xcite it was recently shown @xcite that short - range - ordered stripes give rise to an `` hour - glass '' magnetic spectrum , very similar to that observed in neutron scattering experiments both on la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5@xcite and yba@xmath1cu@xmath6o@xmath7.@xcite    while neutron and x - ray scattering were used to detect superstructure modulations from long - range charge order,@xcite there is relatively little information on the electronic structure of stripe states .",
    "both stm and photoemission indicate the presence of coherent , gapless nodal quasiparticles ( qp ) in ( 1,1 ) direction , whereas antinodal qp in ( 1,0 ) direction are rather incoherent and likely dominated by charge ordering.@xcite for the compound la@xmath3ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 , a @xmath0-wave - like gap was recently reported,@xcite which may be attributed to static stripes or to fluctuating superconductivity.@xcite    in this paper , we present a detailed study of local electronic properties of disordered stripe states in cuprates , using a cdw order - parameter approach plus a mean - field theory for the single - particle dynamics .",
    "a central ingredient is the @xmath0-wave - like form factor of the charge order,@xcite which causes the modulations to be located primarily on cu - o - cu bonds instead of on cu sites .",
    "our results reproduce central features of the stm data of refs .  .",
    "as we employ the _ same _ model for the collective cdw modes as in ref .",

    "observed experimentally , all fields will be defined for discrete lattice coordinates.@xcite      the cdw part @xmath9 captures the tendency toward stripe ordering and is identical to that of ref .  : two complex fields @xmath10 represent the amplitude of horizontal and vertical stripe order at wavevectors @xmath11 , such that the real field @xmath12 ( similarly for @xmath13 ) measures the modulation of both the charge density and bond order ( i.e. , kinetic energy or pairing amplitude ) , for @xmath14 on sites and bonds , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath15 is the deviation of the local hole density from its spatial average .",

    "the coupling constants @xmath44 decide about the electronic struture of the cdw state , by implementing modulations of charge densities and bond kinetic and pairing energies . in the simplest picture , stripes correspond to modulations in the on - site charge densities .",
    "those are induced by @xmath45 and lead to a nearly @xmath46-independent ( @xmath47-wave ) cdw form factor @xmath48.@xcite however , local ordering can instead be dominated by physics on cu - o - cu _ bonds _ : stripe formation is driven by the competition between kinetic and magnetic energies , both living on bonds.@xcite we have recently argued@xcite that such a bond - dominated stripe state will have modulations in @xmath49 with locally different signs on horizontal and vertical bonds , implying a strong @xmath0-wave component of @xmath50 , see fig . 1 of ref .  .",

    "the separation of degrees of freedom into quasiparticles and collective cdw fields , both with full spatial or momentum dependence , is phenomenological and can not be rigorously justified .",
    "however , e.g. , in the context of electrons interacting with antiferromagnetic fluctuations , this has proven to be a fruitful route of investigation.@xcite      stm experiments determine the spatially resolved local density of states ( ldos ) , @xmath54 , up to an @xmath55-dependent tunnel matrix element ( which depends on the set - point conditions.@xcite ) to separate physical modulations from set - point effects , the ldos ratios @xmath56 have been used . in a weakly doped mott insulator , both @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( measuring spectral particle  hole asymmetry ) can be shown to be proportional to the hole density.@xcite in ref .  , spatial modulations were observed in @xmath59 . in the following",

    "pinning is important especially in the disordered phase of @xmath67 : quenched disorder ( e.g. from dopant impurities ) acts as a random field and renders _",
    "static _ a short - range ordered stripe configuration .",
    "in such a situation , the electronic properties can be approximately calculated by diagonalizing @xmath60 for fixed static configurations of @xmath18 .",
    "we generate these from classical lattice monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of @xmath67 , using a standard metropolis algorithm at a finite effective temperature ( @xmath68 ) in a regime where the stripe correlation length is of order @xmath69.@xcite the numerical procedure parallels that of the adiabatic approximation of ref .  , with the difference that the ingredient of pinning is crucial to obtain a static signal in stm .",
    "( the presence or absence of pinning was irrelevant to the finite - frequency spin fluctuations described in ref .  . ) in contrast to earlier work dealing with fermionic properties in the presence of disordered stripes,@xcite our modelling implements the @xmath0-wave bond character , and it properly describes short - range order via @xmath70 , i.e. , stripe segments coexist with checkerboard domain walls.@xcite      the parameters of @xmath71 , eqs .",

    "[ fig : ord]a .",
    "the cdw part of the action , @xmath67 , is designed to capture the complicated non - universal physics of the strongly correlated cdw formation on the lattice scale .",
    "the combination of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 decides about the importance of amplitude vs. phase fluctuations of the cdw,@xcite we have used @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 . choosing @xmath82 prefers stripes over checkerboards , but allows for some checkerboard structure between stripe domains.@xcite finally , @xmath83 is taken for a moderate commensurate lattice pinning toward bond - centered stripes .",
    "the precise values of the mass @xmath47 and the gradient @xmath84 were used to tune the cdw correlation length @xmath85 , which was between 10 and 30 in our simulations . note that an overall scale factor in @xmath67 is free and determines the typical amplitude of @xmath26 which we have normalized to unity .",
    "the @xmath67 parameters here are identical to those used in figs . 1a , 2a of ref .   for the description of the spin excitations of fluctuating stripes",
    "moreover , the charge configurations generated from the mc simulations visually match the stm results in the sense that short and medium stripe segments coexist with checkerboard - like domain walls .",
    "this property is robust with respect to parameter changes of 20% and more , provided that the correlation length @xmath85 is kept fixed .",
    "as we employ classical mc simulations for @xmath67 , with time gradients absent , the parameters can not be translated directly into physical energies or velocities .",
    "our approach assumes that a mean - field picture of both superconductivity and charge order is a reasonable starting point for the description of cuprates .",
    "the adiabatic approximation neglects inelastic processes and stripe dynamics , which can be justified if the latter is slow ( compared to the observed fermions ) , as happens in the proximity to a cdw ordering transition .",
    "thus , the approximation is invalid for energies below a typical stripe fluctuation frequency ; for strong impurity pinning this scale is small or zero.@xcite the quasiparticle picture in cuprates may break down at elevated energies ; as far as this happens due to inelastic physics , it is not captured by our approach ( while some elastic disorder physics is captured ) .",
    "further , we assume that dimerization and bond order are the driving forces behind stripe ordering,@xcite whereas magnetic long - range order is less important . for simplicity",
    ", we therefore neglect both order and fluctuations in the triplet channel . note",
    "that this does not mean that we ignore local - moment physics entirely , but instead we assume that those moments form singlet valence bonds , which is accounted for by modulated hoppings ( @xmath86 ) in @xmath87 .",
    "we note that the coupling to magnetic fluctuations will contribute to the broadening primarily of antinodal quasiparticles,@xcite but a calculation including spatial disorder and inelastic processes is beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "( ii ) real - space localization of antinodal qp _ can not _ be made responsible for the loss of qpi at higher @xmath101 .",
    "we have calculated the inverse participation ratio ( not shown ) as an indicator of localization , and have observed no localization signatures on scales up to several @xmath85 ( while these length scales are sufficient to observe qpi ) .    more generally , the compatibility of stripes with long - lived nodal qp has been pointed out in the past.@xcite for small stripe amplitude , this already follows from the fact that the ordering wavevector @xmath102 does _ not _ connect the nodal points.@xcite in our case , nodal qp survive even for _ large _ stripe amplitude due to the @xmath0-wave character of the charge order ( provided that the @xmath47-wave component remains small).@xcite    within our simulations , the survival of coherent nodal qp in the presence of disordered stripes is also seen in the ldos spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , taken along two different line cuts indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis1 ] .",
    "while strong inhomogeneities occur at elevated energies , in particular near the gap energy ( note the period-4 modulation in fig .  [ fig : spectra]b around @xmath103 mev ) , the low - energy part of the ldos is essentially homogeneous,@xcite again in striking similarity to stm data.@xcite ( a detailed comparison of our spectra with experiment reveals several differences , which we believe to be related to mott physics not captured here . )",
    "we have determined electronic properties of short - range ordered stripe states , coexisting with superconductivity . agreement with salient features of stm experiments , in particular stripy ldos modulations at elevated energies coexisting with qp interference at low energies , is found for valence - bond stripes with @xmath0-wave - like form factor , singling out a specific mean - field plus stripe disorder model .    as the _ same _",
    "collective - mode description was used earlier to model magnetic excitations in the presence of fluctuating or disordered stripes , our calculations give a unified account of stripe signatures seen in stm and in neutron scattering , and strongly indicate that similar physics underlies the modulated states observed in different underdoped cuprates .",
    "very recent stm experiments@xcite indicate the quasiparticle interference disappears not only at high energies , but at a very specific location in momentum space , approximately at the boundary of the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone",
