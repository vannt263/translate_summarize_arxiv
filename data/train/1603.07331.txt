    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) result from the thermonuclear explosion of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs @xcite , and are important cosmological distance indicators .",
    "despite their intense study , the explosion mechanisms and progenitor scenarios for these events are still not well understood @xcite .",
    "there are two general progenitor scenarios which explain the mechanism by which the white dwarf accretes the necessary mass .",
    "the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario posits a non - degenerate companion star to the white dwarf @xcite , while the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario has two white dwarfs in the pre - supernova system @xcite . a third variant possibility , the double detonation explosion mechanism , results from the initial detonation of he on the white dwarf surface , which subsequently triggers carbon detonation in the core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the initial he detonation comes from accretion from either a degenerate or non - degenerate companion star .",
    "the identification of the progenitor systems of sne ia has eluded a clear answer even though many observational techniques have been developed to search for relevant clues ( see * ? ? ? * for a concise summary ) .",
    "one indirect method for identifying the sd scenario has to do with the fact that part of the hydrogen - rich envelope of the companion star is expected to become unbound via interactions with the sn ejecta , embedded in the inner , low - velocity material @xcite .",
    "this unbound hydrogen material has long been searched for  via the h@xmath6 line  in late - time spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one tentative detection has been reported ( in sn 2013ct ; * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that the sd scenario is sub - dominant , but given that physical limits are reliant on imperfect models ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is essential to investigate alternative proposed hydrogen signatures .",
    "a novel avenue to search for signs of interaction with a companion star was recently presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m14 ) .",
    "building off the work of @xcite , m14 utilized hydrodynamic simulations of the impact between the sn ejecta and a non - degenerate companion star , along with detailed radiative transfer simulations @xcite , to investigate both broadband light curve and hydrogen emission signatures in the maximum and post - maximum period ( up to about 2 months after explosion ) in both the optical and nir .",
    "m14 suggested that the h@xmath6 line would be difficult to detect in this time frame , but the expected pa@xmath3 emission line signature would be increasingly visible in the @xmath71@xmath22 months after maximum light .",
    "there have been searches for pa@xmath3 emission in late time spectra ( + 200 days or more after @xmath0-band maximum ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but not at the epochs suggested by m14 .",
    "intrigued by the prospect of constraining the sn ia progenitor with post - maximum nir observations , we present a sequence of high signal - to - noise nir spectra of sn 2014j , hosted by m82 @xcite and provide the first constraints on a nondegenerate companion star utilizing the pa@xmath3 line in the post - maximum period .",
    "we adopt the light curve parameters of sn  2014j determined by @xcite , with the time of @xmath0-band maximum at 2014 february 1.74 ut ( mjd= 56689.74 ) ; our data is presented with respect to this date throughout this work .",
    "we also adopt the light curve decline rate from @xcite , @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 = 1.12 mag , and a distance modulus of @xmath11 = 27.64@xmath120.1 mag to m82 based on the average of the two tip of the red giant branch distance measurements presented in @xcite .",

    "the imaging data was reduced in a standard way , and aperture photometry of the sky - subtracted frames was done with iraf .",
    "the magnitude of sn 2014j was determined differentially , utilizing the nearby two micron all sky survey star j09553494 + 6938552 as a reference .",
    "as no difference imaging was performed , we placed artificial stars into our data in regions with a similar background as that of sn  2014j to assess any potential systematic uncertainties .",
    "this exercise suggests that the @xmath13 band magnitudes after + 54d may suffer systematics of order @xmath70.1 mag , while those in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands are of order @xmath70.04 mag .",
    "this nir photometry is a satisfactory match to that presented in @xcite around maximum light but there are systematic differences at later epochs , although the mt .",
    "abu photometry has been shown to be a good match to the nir light curve of sn  2011fe up to + 41d , which is most relevant to our later search for pa@xmath3 emission ( see   [ sec : search ] ) .",
    "we present our nir photometry in figure  [ fig : lc ] and table  [ table : nirphot ] .",
    "no correction was made for either milky way extinction or the inferred extinction due to m82 , as the nir light curves appear to be nearly extinction - free based on a comparison with the sn 2011fe light curve @xcite .",

    "a log of the observations is presented in table  [ table : spectlog ] .",
    "all of the spectra are available on wiserep @xcite .",
    "abu infrared observatory nir spectra were taken with the near - infrared camera / spectrograph on the 1.2 m telecope , which is equipped with a 1024@xmath161024 hgcdte hawaii array .",
    "for the full wavelength coverage of 0.85 to 2.4 @xmath11 m , three grating settings were used , with a final resolution of @xmath17=1000 .",
    "all spectra were recorded with the target dithered between two positions along the slit for effective sky subtraction and were reduced in a standard way using iraf tasks ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "observations of an a - type star were used to correct for the effects of telluric absorption .",
    "the gnirs spectra were taken in cross - dispersed mode , using the 32 l mm@xmath18 grating and the 0675 slit , giving continuous wavelength coverage from 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath11 m and @xmath17@xmath71000 . the observational strategy again consisted of the classical abba technique , with the slit positioned along the parallactic angle .",
    "data reduction was done with the xdgnirs pyraf - based pipeline provided by gemini observatory , which flattens the data , subtracts the sky in the ab pairs , stacks the 2d data and extracts 1d distortion - corrected and wavelength - calibrated spectra .",
    "corrections for telluric absorption , and simultaneous flux calibration , were accomplished using the idl software package xtellcor and observations of a0v telluric standards using the methodology of @xcite . since the spectra were taken in a variety of photometric conditions and different slit widths ,",
    "we rescaled each to match the @xmath13-band magnitude at each epoch ( note the pa@xmath3 line lies in the @xmath13-band ) , interpolating the light curve presented in   [ phot ] .",
    "m14 has highlighted that the pa@xmath3 line can be used to identify unbound hydrogen rich material from a companion star in a sn ia , and provides a stronger / clearer signal than the h@xmath6 line in the post - maximum time frame .",
    "if the modeling of m14 is correct , the pa@xmath3 line should be easily observable , growing stronger after maximum light through @xmath71@xmath22 months post - maximum ( the time period studied by m14 ) , across a range of viewing angles between the observer , companion star and supernova .",
    "thus , studying the pa@xmath3 line at these epochs may provide an efficient path to obtaining progenitor constraints on a statistically significant sample of sne ia .",
    "this time period corresponds with the rise and decline of the secondary light curve maximum observed in the nir ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] and figure 18 in * ? ? ?",
    "some observational details of the expected signal in the pa@xmath3 line can be gleaned from m14 .",
    "the model that was focused on ( termed ` rga ' ) consisted of a 1 @xmath5 red giant companion star with a radius of 7@xmath1610@xmath19 cm and a separation from the white dwarf of 2@xmath1610@xmath20 cm at the time of explosion .",
    "this red giant has a 0.4 @xmath5 he core mass and a 0.6 @xmath5 , convective h - rich envelope .",
    "the companion radius was determined so that it filled its roche lobe at the time of explosion . in this model",
    "( and the other models presented in m14 ) , @xmath70.4 @xmath5 of h - rich material becomes unbound by the sn interaction , although this is probably an overestimate in their main sequence model due to resolution effects .",
    "the reader is referred to m14 for further details about the hydrodynamic and radiative transfer methodology used .",
    "the post maximum pa@xmath3 feature was particularly conspicuous in the m14 model at post - maximum epochs , more so than h@xmath6 , both because of the lower optical depths in the nir and optical contamination from silicon near the putative h@xmath6 emission .",
    "comparisons between the models with and without unbound hydrogen yielded flux enhancements of up to @xmath750@xmath260% if the viewer were aligned with the non - degenerate companion star and supernova at + 25d to + 40d .    to show the observational feasibility of pa@xmath3 signatures , m14 used archival data of sn  1999ee at + 30d and + 40d and compared it with sn  2005cf spectra at similar epochs ",
    "a direct comparison of the spectra is a good measure of the relative amount of hydrogen in the two events , and we will utilize this fact in our sn  2014j search below .",
    "m14 also implanted pa@xmath3 emission drawn from their hydrodynamic and radiative transfer models ( for the red giant companion scenario , rga ) directly into their sn  1999ee data , demonstrating the strength of the signal .",
    "their rough detection limits corresponded to a hydrogen mass of @xmath40.1 @xmath5 if viewed from the companion star side and @xmath40.2 @xmath5 if viewed from the opposite direction .",
    "we now mimic the approach of m14 to constrain the amount of unbound hydrogen material in sn  2014j by both direct comparison with nir spectra of other sne ia at similar epochs and by implanting pa@xmath3 emission features into our data .",
    "first , we have visually inspected the spectral region around the pa@xmath3 line for our entire nir data set , as can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : specs ] .",
    "the dominant spectral feature in this wavelength range is a broad bump from roughly 1.25 to 1.30 @xmath11 m which persists throughout our nir spectral sequence from + 15.3d to + 92.4d .",
    "this feature was identified as in the modeling of sn  2005cf done by @xcite .  according to m14 s calculation , excess pa@xmath3 emission can be visible by eye , especially at epochs around + 40d , where pa@xmath3",
    "is visible at all viewing angles  at least for the optimistic scenario of @xmath70.3 @xmath5 of unbound hydrogen material .",
    "no pa@xmath3 emission lines are visible in our data set .",
    "given this lack of visible emission , we turn to direct comparisons with other data sets . to compare the region around pa@xmath3 with other well - studied sne ia , we have searched the literature for nir spectra taken at similar epochs to our gemini spectra of sn  2014j at + 17.7d , 37.7d and 45.6d .",
    "spectra from sne with a s / n @xmath2125 per unit wavelength and within @xmath74 days of our gnirs spectra were considered .",
    "several fast declining sne ( with @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath221.5 ) do have published nir spectra at the appropriate epochs , but they show systematically different velocities from sn  2014j and the others presented here , and so we also do not include them in our current comparison .",
    "in future work we will need to confirm and understand any systematic spectral trends in the pa@xmath3 region in order to perform a statistical search .",
    "relatively few spectra match all of these criteria , but we utilize data from sn 2011fe @xcite , sn 1998bu @xcite , sn 2004da @xcite , sn 1999ee @xcite , and sn 2003du @xcite . we also include unpublished gemini / gnirs and magellan / fire spectra of asassn-14lp at + 14.4d , + 19.6d , + 35.3d and + 42.4d , which will be presented in a future contribution ( sand et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "these asassn-14lp spectra in particular are of similar quality to the sn  2014j gnirs spectra ; an initial analysis of the optical properties of asassn-14lp has been presented in @xcite .    for each phase",
    "- matched spectrum , we rescaled the flux to match that of sn  2014j in the 1.15 to 1.35 @xmath11 m region and over - plotted the result ( figure  [ fig : pb ] ) .",
    "if we assume that each comparison spectrum serves as a ` hydrogen - free ' template , dividing the relevant sn  2014j spectrum by the template spectrum yields a residual spectrum that can be searched for features around the pa@xmath3 line ( also shown in figure  [ fig : pb ] ) .",
    "it is not necessarily the case that each comparison spectrum is ` hydrogen - free ' .",
    "if , for instance , the comparison spectrum had significant pa@xmath3 emission but sn  2014j did not , then we would see an absorption feature in the residual spectrum ( we do not see any such features ) .",
    "if both the comparison spectrum and sn  2014j had similar amounts of pa@xmath3 the residual spectrum would be smooth with no hydrogen sensitivity . while we continue with the ` hydrogen - free ' conceit throughout the rest of the paper ,",
    "this highlights the importance of obtaining larger samples of post - maximum nir spectra of nearby sn ia .",
    "the comparison nir spectra match that of sn  2014j reasonably well , and the asassn-14lp spectra in particular are nearly an identical match .",
    "a visual inspection of the residual spectra shows smooth variations , likely due to slight differences in the line strength and velocity .",
    "there are no emission features in the pa@xmath3 region .    to put a quantitative limit on the mass of hydrogen in our sn  2014j spectra , we have implanted gaussian emission lines into the pa@xmath3 region corresponding to those predicted by m14 ( in their red giant companion scenario , rga ) .",
    "to do this , we refer to figure  23 in m14 , where pa@xmath3 emission lines drawn from their model spectra were implanted into the nir spectrum of sn  1999ee at + 39d ( we did not use the sn  1999ee spectrum ourselves , as its morphology did not match that of sn  2014j ) .",
    "we have visually determined the total flux and velocity width of the pa@xmath3 lines in figure  23 of m14 , and rescaled them to the distance of sn  2014j .",
    "there is potentially at least a @xmath720% systematic associated with this ` by eye ' estimation , even just factoring in the distance uncertainties of sn  1999ee and sn  2014j ; this is acceptable for the purposes of this exploratory study . for the scenario where the non - degenerate companion star is directly between the observer and the supernova ( @xmath23=0@xmath24 )",
    ", we estimate a hydrogen mass of @xmath70.3 @xmath5 corresponds to a pa@xmath3 flux of 6 @xmath16 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath26 @xmath18 and velocity full width at half maximum of 3500 km s@xmath18 .",
    "likewise , for a viewing angle of @xmath23=180@xmath24 a pa@xmath3 flux of 4 @xmath16 10@xmath25 ergs s@xmath18 @xmath26 @xmath18 and velocity full width at half maximum of 2500 km s@xmath18 was estimated from m14 . while these values correspond to the optimistic red giant companion scenario of m14",
    ", we assume that changes in the pa@xmath3 flux correspond to proportional changes in the hydrogen mass , as was implied by m14 themselves .",
    "we focus on the + 45.6d spectrum of sn  2014j , and its well - matched counterpart , asassn-14lp at + 42.4d , as this phase is expected to have the strongest pa@xmath3 emission over the phase range studied by m14 . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : pb ]",
    "we have implanted pa@xmath3 emission lines corresponding to 0.3 , 0.1 , 0.03 @xmath5 of hydrogen for both @xmath23=0@xmath24 and 180@xmath24 scenarios . inspecting the residual spectra when the pa@xmath3 lines have been implanted ,",
    "it is clear @xmath70.1 @xmath5 of unbound hydrogen can be ruled out for all sn - companion star orientations , and we adopt this as the hydrogen mass limit found in our study .",
    "hydrogen masses of @xmath70.03 @xmath5 are not distinguishable with our technique .",
    "we have presented an extensive nir spectroscopic data set of the nearby sn  ia 2014j .",
    "a @xmath1 light curve is also presented that extends the dataset out to + 71d , while the seventeen nir spectra correspond to epochs between + 15.3d and + 92.5d .",
    "we use the nir spectra to search for pa@xmath3 emission at these epochs to constrain any interaction with hydrogen rich material",
    ".    visual inspection of the spectral region around pa@xmath3 , and direct comparisons with nir spectra of other sne ia taken at similar epochs , yield no clear emission . by placing gaussian emission lines into our data , meant to mimic the red giant pa@xmath3 models of m14 , we estimate hydrogen mass limits of @xmath70.1 @xmath5 for all viewing angles between the sn and any possible companion star ( assuming a linear scaling between pa@xmath3 flux and hydrogen mass ) .",
    "these limits are comparable to or below the unbound mass seen in some simulations including a non - degenerate companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but higher than the unbound mass predicted and discussed by some others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as our limit is based off of the red giant model of m14 , it is not clearly applicable to main sequence companions .",
    "thus , explicit modeling of pa@xmath3 for a variety of red giant and main sequence companions would aid in the interpretation of any pa@xmath3 found in the future .",
    "other effects , such as the velocity of the unbound hydrogen ( cf .",
    "* ) , can plausibly effect the line profile of pa@xmath3 and should be modeled in detail as well .    other constraints on sn  2014j s progenitor system have lent tentative support to both the single @xcite and double degenerate @xcite scenarios .",
    "most analogous to the current work , @xcite combined numerical models and a late time optical spectrum of sn  2014j ( at + 315d ) to put a limit of 0.0085 @xmath5 on any hydrogen - rich unbound mass .",
    "this limit is a factor of @xmath710 more stringent than that presented here for the pa@xmath3 line , but this should improve as both the spectral modeling and observational techniques become more sophisticated .",
    "the outlook for using post - maximum nir spectra as a means to constrain the sn ia progenitor is excellent . in particular , the _ carnegie supernova project ii _ has acquired an extensive set of nir spectra on a variety of nearby sn ia spanning their observational diversity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
