    "the casimir effect @xcite is not only a field witnessing rapid experimental as well as theoretical progress , it also continues to offer surprising new features .",
    "the casimir effect derives its fascination from the fact that it originates from quantum fluctuations of the radiation field or of the charge distribution on the mesoscopic or macroscopic test bodies .",
    "moreover , it inspires many branches of physics , ranging from mathematical to applied physics , see @xcite for reviews and @xcite for experimental verifications .",
    "a distinctive feature of casimir forces between test bodies is the dependence on the geometry , i.e. , the shape and orientation of these bodies . for a comparison between theory and a real casimir experiment ,",
    "a number of properties such as finite conductivity , surface roughness and finite temperature have to be taken into account in addition .",
    "generically , these latter corrections do not factorize but take influence on one another .",
    "for instance , the interplay between dielectric material properties and finite temperature @xcite is still a subject of intense theoretical investigations and has created a long - standing controversy @xcite .",
    "also the role of electrostatic patch potentials has been suggested as a potentially problematic issue @xcite , which has become a matter of severe debate @xcite .",
    "the present article is not meant to resolve these controversies . on the contrary",
    ", our work intends to draw attention to another highly nontrivial interplay which on the one hand needs to be accounted for when comparing theory and a real experiment and on the other hand is another characteristic feature of the casimir effect : the interplay between geometry and temperature .",
    "as first conjectured by jaffe and scardicchio @xcite , the temperature dependence of the casimir effect can be qualitatively different for different geometries , as both the pure casimir effect as well as its thermal corrections arise from the underlying spectral properties of the fluctuations .",
    "first analytical as well as numerical evidence of this `` geothermal '' interplay in a perpendicular - plates configuration has been found in @xcite using the worldline formalism .",
    "the physical reason for this interplay can be understood in simple terms : for the classical parallel - plate case , the nontrivial part of the fluctuation spectrum is given by the modes orthogonal to the plates .",
    "this relevant part of the spectrum has a gap of wave number @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the plate separation . for small temperatures @xmath8 , the higher - lying relevant modes",
    "can hardly be excited , such that their thermal contribution to the casimir force remains suppressed : the resulting force law for the parallel - plates case scales like @xmath9 .",
    "this argument for a suppression of thermal contributions applies to all geometries with a gap in the relevant part of the spectrum ( e.g. concentric cylinders or spheres , casimir pistons , etc . ) .",
    "these geometries are called _",
    "closed_.    this reason for a suppression of thermal contributions is clearly absent for _ open _ geometries with a relevant gapless part of the spectrum . for these geometries , relevant modes of the spectrum can always be excited at any small temperature value .",
    "therefore , a stronger thermal contribution @xmath10 with @xmath11 can be expected . as experimentally important configurations such as",
    "the sphere - plate or the cylinder - plate geometry belong to this class of open geometries , a potentially significant geothermal interplay may exist in the relevant parameter range @xmath12 .    in the present work , we provide further evidence for the geometry - temperature interplay in the casimir effect . for simplicity , we study the casimir effect induced by a fluctuating real scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary conditions ( dirichlet scalar ) . as an illustrative example , we concentrate on an inclined - plates configuration ; here , a semi - infinite plate is located above an infinite one , with an angle of inclination of @xmath13 , see fig .",

    "a reliable study of geothermal casimir phenomena requires a method that is capable of dealing with very general casimir geometries . for this",
    ", we use the worldline approach to the casimir effect @xcite , which is based on a mapping of field - theoretic fluctuation averages onto quantum - mechanical path integrals @xcite . for arbitrary backgrounds , this worldline integral representing the spacetime trajectories of the quantum fluctuations",
    "can straightforwardly be computed by monte carlo methods @xcite . as the computational algorithm is generally independent of the background , i.e.",
    ", the casimir geometry in our case , casimir problems can straightforwardly be tackled with this method .",
    "high - precision computations for dirichlet - scalar fluctuations have been performed , e.g. , for the sphere - plate and cylinder - plate case @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the worldline approach can also be used to obtain novel analytical results ( see also @xcite for an analytical worldline approximation technique ) .    in order to overcome standard approximative tools based , e.g. , on the proximity - force theorem @xcite , a variety of new field - theoretical methods for casimir phenomena",
    "have been developed in recent years , ranging from improved approximation methods @xcite to exact methods mainly based on scattering theory @xcite or a functional integral approach @xcite .",
