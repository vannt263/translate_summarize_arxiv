    "a near - equilibrium galaxy only evolves through the excitation of some non - axisymmetric structure such as spiral arms , bars , infalling satellites , etc .",
    "the resulting `` waves '' are likely actors in triggering star formation , mediating inward gas flow thereby fueling agn , heating the stellar disk , among other observable phenomena .",
    "in addition , the overall evolution of near equilibrium galaxies is caused by the collective transport of energy and angular momentum from these same structures .",
    "an accurate theory of secular evolution is essential for developing our understanding of these interrelated dynamics .",
    "the first step is predicting the evolution of the non - axisymmetric distortions .",
    "the underlying dynamical mechanism for the stellar and dark matter components is understood . at the level of individual orbits , an excitation such as a bar , a spiral pattern , or orbiting satellite produces a periodic distortion on all orbits ,",
    "much like a driven harmonic oscillator .",
    "although the torque distorts a typical orbit , this distortion averages to zero over many orbital periods for most orbits .",
    "however , for nearly closed orbits , the net torque does not vanish .",
    "an adiabatic invariant is broken by the vanishing precession frequency of the closed orbit ; clearly , there is no adiabatic invariant for a degree of freedom with no motion .",
    "the perturbation then couples to the oscillatory distortion for these orbits and net torque is transferred to or from these orbits .",
    "this coupling between the forced oscillation and the perturbation will be second order in the perturbation strength . in time , the perturbation itself and the underlying equilibrium is slowly changed by this torque .",
    "this leads to a finite measure of orbits that transfer angular momentum to and from the pattern ( for additional discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper 2 ) .",
    "although the first - order perturbation may dominate the instantaneous changes to phase space , the second - order changes describe the net changes that will persist after many dynamical times .",
    "this process was described mathematically by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lbk ) in the limit that the change in the perturbation is very slow but still fast enough that the orbital perturbations remain linear .",
    "lbk derived a formula describing the exchange of angular momentum between a spiral pattern and the rest of the disk assuming that the perturbation began infinitely long in the past , the time - asymptotic limit . in this limit , any vestigial response from the formation of the pattern is gone .",
    "the lbk approach has been widely applied to estimate secular evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite took the first step towards a time - dependent generalisation of the lbk formalism for studying secular disk evolution .",
    "they included time - dependent transients but evaluated the secular changes in the infinite time limit .",
    "this is appropriate for studying the cumulative effect of short - lived transients .",
    "however , the perturbation theory may be fully generalised to treat arbitrary time - dependent perturbations over arbitrary intervals of time .",
    "this allows us to treat the long - lived bar and satellite interactions over the full age of a galaxy with some surprising results .    in attempting a detailed description of the angular momentum exchange between a rotating bar and a dark halo in an n - body simulation (",
    "see paper 2 ) , i found a significant discrepancy between the predictions of the second - order lbk perturbation theory and the n - body simulation .",
    "this discrepancy persisted for perturbations over a wide range of bar amplitudes and scaled with time and perturbation amplitude as expected from second - order linear theory , implying that its source is not a break down in linearity .",
    "rather , the problem is due to the assumption of an infinitely slow growth of the perturbation .",
    "not only is the number of characteristic dynamical times in a galactic age modest , the growth of a bar , arms and of course satellites is most likely a small fraction of the galactic age .",
    "because patterns often appear over several orbital periods and the total number of orbital periods available are small , transients may be significant and the time - asymptotic limit does not apply .",
    "i will show in this paper that a finite - time - limit generalisation of the lbk formula gives quantitatively and qualitatively different results .",
    "quantitatively , we will see that the overall torque is smaller than that computed from the lbk formula for a rotating bar .",
    "qualitatively , different commensurabilities are important at different epochs of the evolution . because the location of the resonances in physical space are important for the long - term evolution of galaxy , including the finite - time response is important for understanding this evolution . in this limit ,",
    "the time dependence is more than simply a transient but embodies the galaxy s evolutionary history .",
    "i will present a new , generalised secular evolution formula and describe the important details of the dynamics in ",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "the new torque formula replaces the delta function in the lbk formula by an integral over the time - dependent perturbation and is similarly straightforward to apply .",
    "two specific applications are presented in ",

    "n - body simulations will demonstrate the importance of the finite - time response to the net torque and illustrate the discrepancy with the lbk formula . in ",

    "the desired solution is the inverse laplace transform of the series : @xmath35 where each coefficient @xmath27 is given by equation ( [ eq : dfser2 ] ) .",
    "the inverse fourier - laplace transform of equation ( [ eq : dfser ] ) is straightforward albeit cumbersome . recall that the product of the first - order distribution function and the first - order torque per orbit gives the second - order torque",

    "the n - body simulation closely follows the time - dependent linear theory prediction .",

    "this transient echo decays after the rapid slow down phase since it is purely oscillating without a net second - order contribution . nonetheless , it diminishes the torque during peak of the slow down .",
    "the ilr and the other commensurate terms , on the other hand , approaches the finite non - zero time - asymptotic value predicted by the lbk formula .    the relative importance of the torque to the inner halo is nicely visualised by computing the net change in angular momentum inside of some energy @xmath55 from equation ( [ eq : lbk1 ] ) as a function of time .",

    "orbiting satellites couple to a _ live halo _ through resonances in much the same way as does a rotating bar .",
    "however , because the satellite size is generally much smaller than the halo scale , the total torque will have significant contributions from harmonic orders where @xmath103 is the harmonic order .",

    "just as in the case of the bar , the @xmath76 resonance can couple to very small radii although the satellite perturbation will have a different frequency spectrum and amplitude than the bar perturbation .",
    "higher - order contributions have energies and response locations similar to the satellite .",
    "to investigate this situation , i assume that the satellite s orbit decays according the the local chandrasekhar formula while remaining on a circular orbit .",
    "this , then determines the radius of the satellite orbit and the instantaneous orbital frequency , @xmath104 .",

    "it is possible to compute the torque self - consistently by including a larger number of @xmath103 terms ( eq . [ eq : dfser4 ] ) .",
    "however , in this example , we only want to illustrate the contribution of the lower - order terms for comparison with the bar example and therefore the additional complexity and time to compute the self - consistent evolution is not justified .",
    "because the satellite orbital radius changes in time , the torque takes the form of equation ( [ eq : lbk1 ] ) : the time - dependence in the rotation is not separable from the time - dependence of the changing fourier coefficients in equation ( [ eq : ftcoef ] ) .",
    "the torque is then straightforwardly computed for low - order @xmath103 and @xmath105 using equation ( [ eq : lbk2 ] ) although it is more computational intensive than the bar example due to the non - separable time dependence than the bar evolution case .",

    "figure [ fig : lbksatorb ] shows the radius as a function of time for a variety of satellite masses @xmath107 from 0.0025 to 0.1 virial mass units for interpreting the torque plots that follow . as in the case of the bar , the mass is slowly increased using @xmath108 ( from  [ sec : sinksat ] ) with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "the torque for all values of @xmath107 share some common trends : 1 ) the @xmath110 torque is dominated by corotation ( 0:2:2 ) . at early times , there is a moderate ilr transient ( -1:2:2 ) which changes sign and oscillates at later times and the satellite position laps the transient wake , alternatively shifting the sign of the torque . we can remove the turn - on and extrinsic amplitude dependence by dividing @xmath109 by @xmath111 and multiplying the time by @xmath112 . each value of time , then , corresponds to the same satellite radius in each panel .",
    "the initial transient in @xmath113 between radii 0.12 and 0.2 ( panels b , d , and f of fig .",
    "[ fig : lbksat ] ) has a nearly self - similar form .",
    "the differences are due to _ intrinsic _ time dependence from transients .",
    "for example , as @xmath107 decreases , the ilr becomes more localised in time with a larger peak amplitude .",
    "figure [ fig : ilrlzsat ] illustrates the distribution of torque from the ilr as a function of time and energy and radius similar to figure [ fig : energyevolve ] .",
    "torque from the initial transient for the satellite orbiting at @xmath114 is deposited at radii between 0.005 and 0.02 or between 7% and 30% of @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ fig : cumtorque_sat ] plots the ratio of the cumulative change in angular momentum in energy and time , @xmath115 , for the satellite decay shown in figure [ fig : ilrlzsat ] . as in the bar ",
    "halo interaction , the peak total torque occurs at much larger radii than the peak relative torque .",
    "comparing to figure [ fig : cumtorque_bar ] , we see that the change in angular momentum is in the same region of phase space and larger than the 15%-20% fractional change found in the bar example .",
    "since the halo evolves for the bar simulation , we anticipate evolution for the halo driven by this satellite .",
    "the n - body simulation is more difficult to perform in this case because of the disparate scales and will be the subject of a later paper @xcite . since the decay time is proportional to @xmath116 and",
    "the torque is proportional to @xmath117 , the total torque deposited in the transient phase is proportional to satellite mass .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath107 is sufficiently large that the orbital decay takes place in a galaxy age , the angular momentum transport from a few larger merger events may affect the halo profile as described in paper 2 .",
    "eccentric orbits may be treated similarly using equation ( [ eq : lbk2 ] ) . rather than enforce a circular orbit",
    ", one may solve the equations of motion for an orbit decaying according to the chandrasekhar formula and use the solution , simultaneously , as the input to equation ( [ eq : lbk2 ] ) . in practice",
    ", it is convenient to solve the entire problem with a standard ode solver .",
    "unfortunately , there is a wide range of time scales in the problem : the decay time and the orbital time scales throughout phase space . in practice , then , accurate solutions require small time steps .    the additional satellite orbital frequency complicates the spectrum and , because the orbital radius now oscillates as well as decays , complicates the representation of the interaction .",
    "however , qualitatively , the behaviour is similar to the circular case : low - order resonances such as the ilr provide strong positive torque on the halo at early times and then become oscillatory . unlike the circular case , an eccentric orbit will deposit its orbital angular momentum at lower energies because the amplitude of the perturbation will be larger at smaller radii .",
    "this response of the halo may be a wake that influences the subsequent evolution of the disk and the halo .",
    "we will describe our detailed findings for the satellite - halo interaction for eccentric orbits in a later paper .",
    "this paper shows the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lbk ) secular torque formula is not a quantitatively accurate description of secular evolution in galaxies .",
    "the lbk formula assumes that the growth time of a perturbation driving secular evolution is infinitely long compared the characteristic dynamical time .",
    "however , not only is the number of characteristic dynamical times in a galactic age modest , the growth of a spiral arms , a bar or the decay of a large dwarf satellite has evolutionary time scales of order 100 myr to 1 gyr , uncomfortably close to the equilibrium galaxy lifetime of 10 gyr or smaller .",
    "we have seen that the finite time effects yield a different distribution of angular momentum in the halo and a different total torque than for a time - asymptotic system assumed by lbk .",
    "similarly , it is unlikely that time - dependent effects will affect time - asymptotic perturbation theory predictions in planetary systems @xcite where the secular evolution time scale is much larger than the dynamical time scale .    in  [ sec :",
    "method ] , i presented generalised the lbk formula for perturbations of finite duration .",
    "the new formula shares many of the features of the lbk formula ; the main difference is that the dirac delta function @xmath118 is replaced with a time integral ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : lbk1 ] ) . over astronomically - relevant time scales",
    ", the finite - time generalisation shows that transients from the formation history of the system play an important role in the overall dynamical evolution .",
    "for example , figures [ fig : pattern ] and [ fig : lbk ] illustrate the total torque and differential contributions of the principal resonances during slow down of a bar in dark matter halo .",
    "the correct result is the net contribution for approximately 8 resonances ( not all shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbk ] ) and therefore these resonances must be accurately represented in an n - body simulation to obtain the correct result ( see paper 2 ) .",
    "the most important general finding is that the history of galaxy evolution can not be ignored in understanding and predicting a particular galaxy s evolution .",
    "these dynamics are illustrated in two cases : the bar ",
    "halo interaction and the satellite  halo interaction .",
    "the details of the bar  halo interaction have been recently described in paper 2 and explored in a self - consistent simulation in paper 3 @xcite .",
    "both papers demonstrate that bar  halo coupling through the ilr agrees with the predictions presented here . both the lbk formula and the time - dependent formula",
    "predict that the ilr resonance dominates the overall angular momentum transfer .",
    "however , the time - dependent evolution spreads the resonant interaction over a broader range of lower energies that are more populated in phase space and therefore have a larger overall evolutionary consequence .",
    "the time - asymptotic ilr is located at smaller energies and radii and would be inaccessible to most n - body simulations .",
    "the time - asymptotic approximation is especially poor for the ilr resonance in a cuspy halo where the time - dependent spread in frequency corresponds to a large region in radius and energy .",
    "this is strong encouragement to attempt an understanding of the dynamical interactions prior to simulation .",
    "one expects a similar halo response in the satellite ",
    "halo interaction because the quadrupole perturbation from a rotating bar shares much in common with the quadrupole perturbation from an orbiting satellite .",
    "indeed , we show that this is the case .",
    "however , because the symmetries , the radial profile , and the distribution of frequencies for the two perturbations are different , the ilr no longer dominates in the satellite interaction . nonetheless , the ilr does play a role during the early stages of orbital evolution and this has been verified in n - body simulation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the aggregate effect of this mechanism from a population of substructure will be the subject of a later investigation .",
    "the wakes excited by interactions between satellites , disks and dark matter halos give rise to a variety of observable consequences .",
    "for example , large - scale transport of angular momentum throughout the disk and to the halo may will tend to decrease the disk scale length .",
    "the response of the galaxy halo to the surrounding group environment can propagate features to the inner galaxy , exciting disk waves and subsequent star formation .",
    "in addition , the interaction between the satellite and disk will drive bending modes and the energy in these modes will heat the disk .",
    "detailed simulations for these processes of disparate scales are difficult .",
    "time - asymptotic secular perturbation theory has often been used to estimate evolution and compare with simulation .",
    "however , we have found that the difference in amplitude and significance between the time - dependent and time - asymptotic responses for the bar ",
    "halo interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lbk ] ) is dramatic .",
    "if these differences are representative of the difference in these other processes , our current picture of secular evolution must be revisited by considering the time - dependent evolution of these `` waves '' in the context of a galaxy s environmental history .",

    "many thanks to kelly holley - bockelmann for suggestions and a careful reading of this manuscript .",
