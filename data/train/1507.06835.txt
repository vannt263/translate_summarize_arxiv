    "general relativity ( gr ) is a self - consistent theory of gravity where space and time are considered as dynamical variables and new concepts as black holes and cosmic expansion are introduced . from the cosmological point of view , the prediction of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and the formation of primordial light elements maybe represent the greatest success of this theory .",
    "however , despite all these fundamental results , gr has not been fully investigated at the ultraviolet scales , where strong deviations from the standard hilbert - einstein picture emerge , and , on the other hand , new ingredients , such as dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) , are required in order to fit the gravitational dynamics at infrared scales @xcite .",
    "moreover , self - consistent and comprehensive approaches to deal with gravitational interactions at fundamental level ( quantum gravity ) are still missing .",
    "these arguments lead to the conclusion that a unitary theory encompassing the gravitational phenomenology at all scales is still lacking . in the last years , several _ alternative _ or _ modified _ theories of gravity have been proposed , also with the aim to address the shortcomings related to the cosmological standard model , based on gr . for example , higher order curvature invariants than the simple ricci scalar @xmath2 allow to get inflationary behaviors , removing the primordial singularity , as well as to explain the flatness and horizon problems @xcite .",
    "this approach and , of course , all those related to it , are fundamentally motivated by the fact that , at high curvature regimes , further curvature invariants have to be considered for constructing self - consistent effective actions in curved spacetime @xcite . in some sense , the introduction of higher order terms , depending on the invariants of curvature , are required at high curvature regimes .",
    "of course , this is not the final step for building up a quantum gravity theory , but it allows for an effective description that works well at least at one - loop level @xcite .",
    "all the above motivations strongly suggest that towards ultraviolet regimes ( i.e. in high density regimes ) , gr has to be modified by adding further curvature corrections . in the framework of models that extend gr , @xmath0",
    "gravity is certainly one of the favorite candidate since it provides , in a natural way , an almost unified description of de and dm , without invoking exotic sources as dm @xcite . moreover , it allows for the unification of the early - time ( inflation ) and the later - time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "the gravitational action for @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath3\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the action of the standard matter and @xmath5 , with the planck mass @xmath6gev ( details and applications are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "this theory can be viewed as a particular case of scalar - tensor gravity by dealing with further degrees of freedom as a scalar field ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "one of the consequences of dealing with alternative cosmologies , including hence @xmath0 cosmology , is that the thermal history of particles results modified .",
    "in fact , one finds that the expansion rates @xmath7 of the universe , obtained in modified cosmologies , can be written in terms of the expansion rate @xmath8 obtained in gr , @xmath9 , where the factor @xmath10 encodes the information about the particular model of gravity extending or modifying gr .",
    "usually , the factor @xmath10 is defined in order that the successful predictions of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) are preserved , that is @xmath11 at early time , and @xmath12 before bbn begins ( one refers to the pre - bbn epoch since it is not directly constrained by cosmological observations ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the possibility of explaining the pamela observations , i.e. the measured excess in positron flux above @xmath13gev @xcite , in terms of dm thermal relic abundance , by means of @xmath0 cosmology .",
    "in fact , since in the framework of the conventional cosmology and particle physics a widely accepted explanation for such observations is still lacking , one , in principle , can not rule out dark matter , as weakly interactive massive particles ( wimps ) , axions or heavy neutrinos , as a possible solution .",
    "it is worth noting that dm interpretation of pamela data has indeed renewed the interest in alternative cosmologies because , as already noted , these models lead in a natural way to a modification of the expansion rate of the universe @xcite : an enhanced pre - bbn expansion can reconcile observed dm cosmic relic abundance with indirect dm detection experiments ( such as pamela and the more recent ams-02 ) .    according to the above considerations , we assume that the evolution of the universe is governed by an @xmath0 model of the form @xmath14 this model",
    "can be generated , for example , in the framework of supergravity @xcite , and in a perturbative regime it turns out to be a correction of the @xmath15 model ( extended starobinsky s model ) .",
    "results in refs .",
    "@xcite show that the starobinsky model is in good agreement with the bicep2 data .",
    "moreover , sizable primordial tensor modes can be generated in ( marginally deformed ) models of the form ( [ f(r)=r+ar**n ] ) , provided @xmath16 @xcite ( more specifically in @xcite it is shown that if inflation is driven by @xmath0 gravity , then a natural form for this function is ( [ f(r)=r+ar**n ] ) , where the value of @xmath17 could be related to the microscopic theory dictating the trace - log quantum corrections ) .",
    "the main point is to rewrite the @xmath0 action in the einstein frame , which implies the appearance of a scalar field .",
    "the derivation relies essentially on two steps : @xmath18 the introduction of the conformal mode @xmath19 and of the real scalar field @xmath20 , related to @xmath21 as @xmath22 ; @xmath23 the generation of the kinetic term for @xmath20 through the conformal transformation @xmath24 .",
    "inflation occurs for large values of the scalar field , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "this implies @xmath26 or , equivalently , @xmath27 , therefore a regime where the @xmath28-term is dominant .",
    "moreover , the starobinsky - like inflation model may also emerge from dilaton dynamics in brane cosmology scenarios based on string theory @xcite .",
    "models based on ( [ f(r)=r+ar**n ] ) have been also studied in the context of bouncing cosmology ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it has to be also mentioned that the recent analysis by the planck collaboration @xcite led to the conclusion that @xmath29-inflation ( @xmath30 ) is fully consistent with observations @xcite .    at this point",
    "is worth a comment about the _ chameleon mechanism _ and @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism asserts that the compton wavelength @xmath31 ( typically assumed constant ) , associated to the characteristic scales obtained by adding ( pertubative ) higher - order terms to the hilbert - einstein action , is smaller / larger in those regions where the matter density is higher / lower . as a consequence , the theory can be seen as a local effective theory which is valid for a certain range of parameters . for @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "the chameleon mechanism works because , in the high - energy density regions , it reproduces the newtonian gravitational forces , making the model compatible with the solar system tests @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the @xmath0 gravity field equations and solve them in the radiation dominated era ( well before the bbn onsets ) , hence from the period of gut scales to the transition time @xmath32 , when the universe starts to evolve according to the standard cosmological model .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of thermal relics abundance and dm particles required to explain the pamela experiment .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the field equations for @xmath0 gravity follow by varying the action ( [ lagr ] ) with respect to the tensor metric @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the energy - momentum tensor for matter .",
