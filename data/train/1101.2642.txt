    "counting the real solutions of polynomial equations in one variable is a fundamental ingredient behind many deeper tasks and applications involving the topology of real algebraic sets .",

    "the stable log - uniform measure has also been used in work of avendao and ibrahim to study the expected number of roots of sparse polynomial systems over local fields other than @xmath41 @xcite .",

    "for instance , for non - sparse polynomials , it is popular to use specially weighted independent gaussian coefficients since the resulting measure becomes invariant under a natural orthogonal group action ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are unaware of any study of the types of distributions occuring for the coefficients of polynomials actually occuring in physical applications .",

    "one of the main goals of our paper is thus to illustrate and clarify the underlying theory in a non - trivial special case .",
    "we now state our second main result .",
    "recent advances in semidefinite programming have produced efficient algorithms for finding sum of squares representations of certain nonnegative polynomials , thus enabling efficient polynomial optimization under certain conditions .",
    "when the input is a sparse polynomial it is then natural to ask if there is a sum of squares representation that also respects sparseness . indeed , it is well - known that a nonnegative univariate polynomial can always be written as a sum of two squares of , usually non - sparse , polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite for refinements ) .",

    "were there to be a sufficiently efficient representation of positive sparse polynomials as sums of squares , one could then try to use semidefinite programming to find such a representation explicitly for a given polynomial .",
    "this in turn could yield an efficient reduction from deciding the existence of real roots to a ( small ) semidefinite programming problem , similar to the techniques of @xcite .",
    "our last theorem thus reveals an obstruction to this sums of squares approach .",
    "the best known algorithms for real root counting lack speed - ups for sparse polynomials like the average - case complexity bound from our first main result .",
    "for example , in the notation of theorem [ thm : pos ] , @xcite gives an arithmetic complexity bound of @xmath58 which , via the techniques of @xcite , yields a bit complexity bound super - linear in @xmath59 . no algorithm with complexity polynomial in @xmath3 ( deterministic , randomized , or average - case ) appears to have been known before for tetranomials .",
    "( see @xcite for recent speed benchmarks of univariate real solvers . )    as for alternative approaches , softening our concept of sparse sum of squares representation may still enable speed - ups similar to theorem [ thm : pos ] via semidefinite programming .",
    "for instance , one could ask if a positive trinomial of degree @xmath1 always admits a representation as a sum of @xmath60 squares of polynomials with @xmath60 terms .",

    "moreover , suppose that the nonzero coefficients of polynomials @xmath397 come from a finite set @xmath139 .",
    "then , there is an infinite subset @xmath398 of them with corresponding exponents @xmath399 and a single set of real coefficients @xmath395 such that @xmath400 for all @xmath401 .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath398 be an infinite sequence of polynomials with corresponding exponents @xmath399 .",
    "also let @xmath402 be the set of all possible ( polynomial ) coefficients of polynomials @xmath403 ; from lemma [ finiteglemma ] , this set is finite . by assumption ,",
    "each @xmath404 gives rise to a set of equations involving a subset of @xmath402 and real numbers coming from the finite set @xmath139 .",
    "the set of all such equations is again finite , and therefore , by the infinite pigeon - hole principle , there is a subsequence of the @xmath404 which have the same set of equations governing their coefficients @xmath382 . picking any real solution to such a set of equations",
    "finishes the proof .",
    "we now have all the tools we need to prove theorem [ thm : neg ] . however , to make the argument less cumbersome , we first recall  little - oh \" notation : for a function @xmath405 , we say that @xmath406 if @xmath407 it is easy to see that the sum of any finite number of such functions is also @xmath408 . moreover , if @xmath409 for some constant @xmath410 , then @xmath411 .    *",
    "proof of theorem [ thm : neg ] : * suppose , by way of contradiction , that every positive definite trinomial can be written sparsely as the sum of @xmath51 squares , each involving at most @xmath52 terms .",
    "consider the infinite sequence of positive definite trinomials , @xmath412 using lemma [ universalaij ] , we can find a subsequence @xmath413 with corresponding exponents @xmath414 and a single set of real numbers @xmath395 such that latexmath:[$f_{k_s } = s_{p_{k_s}}(x )     assume that the @xmath395 are chosen such that the number of them that are zero is maximal among all such sets of coefficients @xmath395 .",
    "moreover , we shall assume that this maximality still holds if we restrict to any infinite subsequence of the @xmath413 .",
    "for clarity of exposition in what follows , we will not keep updating the subscripting of indices when taking subsequences .",
    "given an exponent matrix @xmath416 , define a new matrix @xmath417 this corresponds naturally to the transformation @xmath418 applied to both sides of an equation @xmath419 .",
    "since @xmath420 , each matrix @xmath421 has entries in the interval @xmath422 $ ] . by compactness , we may choose a subsequence @xmath423 such that @xmath421 converges in the ( entry - wise ) euclidean norm to a matrix @xmath424^{\\ell \\times m}$ ] .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath425 and also that some entry of @xmath426 is @xmath14 ; it turns out that these are the only possible numbers for entries of @xmath426 which play a role in ( [ supposedsos ] ) .",
    "suppose , on the contrary , that @xmath426 contains @xmath429 real numbers , @xmath430 with @xmath431 .",
    "each power of @xmath290 occurring in a summand of equality ( [ supposedsos ] ) , after squaring , is of the form @xmath432 thus , for all sufficiently large @xmath331 , the powers of @xmath290 occurring in equality ( [ supposedsos ] ) are partitioned into classes determined by the number of distinct values , @xmath433    notice that the numbers in formula ( [ exponentssqring ] ) all become strictly smaller ( resp .",
    "larger ) than ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) as @xmath434 unless @xmath435 ( resp .",
    "@xmath436 ) . in particular , with @xmath331 large , the polynomials @xmath437 $ ] for @xmath438 do not involve the indeterminates @xmath382 coming from exponents of the form @xmath439 with @xmath440 .",
    "conversely , each monomial in every polynomial @xmath441 with @xmath442 not in one of the classes from ( [ beginendgs ] ) contains at least one such indeterminate @xmath382 .",
    "since the only nonzero coefficients of the sequence ( [ trinomialfamily ] ) come from the classes from ( [ beginendgs ] ) , it follows that we may replace with @xmath14 all coefficients @xmath395 corresponding to exponents @xmath439 with @xmath440 and still have an equality @xmath443 the claim therefore follows from the maximality property of the chosen set of coefficients @xmath395 .",
    "we next examine what all this says about the limiting behavior of the expressions from equality ( [ supposedsos ] ) .",
    "from the claim , it follows that when @xmath331 is large , we need only consider those exponents from the matrices @xmath423 that are on the order @xmath444 fix such a large @xmath331 and consider the smallest exponent @xmath410 on the order @xmath445 that occurs with a nonzero coefficient in ( [ supposedsos ] ) after substituting the @xmath395 for the @xmath382 .",
    "when the sum from ( [ supposedsos ] ) is expanded , the term @xmath446 will appear with positive coefficient ; i.e. , @xmath447 it follows from the form of the sequence ( [ trinomialfamily ] ) that @xmath448 ( since the other nonzero term is odd ) . in particular , it is not possible to obtain a nonzero coefficient for @xmath449 in @xmath413 .",
