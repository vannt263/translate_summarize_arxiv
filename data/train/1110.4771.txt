    "the problem of quantum information transfer is directly related to the construction of quantum communication systems . in particular , this problem was reduced to the problem of quantum state transfer , which was first formulated by bose in ref .",
    "@xcite for the heisenberg homogeneous chain of spin-1/2 particles .",
    "however , the effect of the state transfer was observed before bose in experiments with so called loshmidt echo @xcite .",
    "many different modifications of the state transfer process have appeared after that .",
    "they are aimed at the improving of the state transfer characteristics , such as the fidelity @xcite and the state transfer distance .",
    "for instance , the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 chains with special values of coupling constants @xcite , the information flux approach @xcite and the spin-1/2 chain in inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite have been proposed for this purpose . in refs .",
    "@xcite the entanglement has been used as a resource which increases the fidelity and speeds up the information transfer . the perfect state transfer with the time dependent hamiltonian",
    "is proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , all suggested methods of the perfect ( or high probability ) state transfer have two basic obstacles for realization : ( i ) the parameters of a quantum system ( such as the coupling constants or / and the local magnetic field ) must be fine tuned which is a complicated task for the experimental realization and ( ii ) the state transfer time interval must be fixed and a minor deviation from its value reduces the fidelity of the state transfer .    at the same time , the requirement to transfer the state of a qubit ( or , more generally , the state of a subsystem ) @xmath0 to the qubit ( subsystem ) @xmath3 might be too rigorous . recall that by the state of subsystem @xmath0 ( or @xmath3 ) we mean the density matrix @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) redused with respect to all nodes of a quantum system , except nodes of the subsystem @xmath0 ( or @xmath3 ) . here",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the usual time .",
    "therefore , we know all information encoded into the subsystem @xmath0 if we know all elements of the matrix @xmath7 .",
    "we say that the information encoded into the initial state of the subsystem @xmath0 ( i.e. in the matrix @xmath8 ) is completely transfered to the subsystem @xmath3 at the instant @xmath9 if we may obtain all elements of @xmath8 performing some operations ( either quantum or classical ) on the elements of @xmath10 .    therefore , in order to transfer the information encoded into the state of the subsystem @xmath0 , it is not necessary to transfer the state itself .",
    "the information transfer is much simpler for the experimental realization in comparison with the state transfer , which will be demonstrated below in this paper .",
    "in fact , the information encoded into the original state of some subsystem @xmath0 of a spin system spreads over the whole system due to the quantum interactions among all nodes .",
    "thus , in principle , it can be obtained ( either partially or completely ) from the analysis of the state of any other subsystem of a quantum system .",
    "this is a general property of a quantum system governed by any hamiltonian , and namely this property will be used hereafter . due to this property",
    "we do not need to adjust precisely parameters of a communication system ( such as the coupling constants and the local magnetic field ) in oder to achieve the complete information transfer between two subsystem .",
    "moreover , the information can be extracted at ( almost ) any time moment @xmath11 .",
    "we see that the information transfer is not subjected to the two above obstacles for the practical realization , which appear in the realization of the state transfer .",
    "a simple model of the information transfer through the two qubit system @xmath12 supplemented by a one qubit sender @xmath13 is considered in @xcite .",
    "the information was transfered from the qubit @xmath13 to the qubit @xmath14 ( receiver ) due to the projective measurement over the two qubit subsystem @xmath15 . in our paper",
    "we provide the information transfer from the sender to the receiver by means of the evolution operator acting on the whole system including the sender .",
    "however , even if the state of the receiver @xmath3 at the instant @xmath16 contains the complete information encoded into the initial state of the sender @xmath0 , there is a problem of extracting of this information from @xmath3 , i.e. the problem of defining the elements of the matrix @xmath10 in practice .",
    "this problem is studied in the quantum tomography @xcite .",
    "we propose a measurement based method of the density matrix reconstruction @xcite , where the multi - channel communication system is used in combination with the appropriate polarization measurements at the end of each channel .",
    "one has to emphasize that the extraction of information by means of measurements is not necessary , for instance , in the case of the data transfer in the quantum computer during the computational process .",
    "in fact , let the data be encoded into the elements of @xmath8 and the matrix @xmath10 is linearly related with the elements of the matrix @xmath8 : @xmath17 .",
    "then the computation algorithm must involve the algorithm solving the above relation with respect to the elements of @xmath8 .",
    "this is a usual mathematical problem which must be resolvable by the quantum computation algorithms @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the description of the information transfer algorithm is represented in sec.[section : inf ] .",
    "examples of the one - qubit density matrix information transfer along the open spin chains are given in sec.[section : examples ] .",
    "a possible three - channel scheme of the experimental realization of the one - qubit information transfer is represented in sec.[section : exp ] .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "[ section : ev ]    let @xmath18 ( communication system ) be a quantum system of @xmath19 spin-1/2 particles ( these particles will be called nodes below in this article , so that the above system is a spin system of @xmath19 nodes ) .",
    "let @xmath0 ( sender ) and @xmath3 ( receiver ) be two different subsystems of the system @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 ( transmission line ) the rest of the quantum system , so that @xmath21 , see fig.[fig : s_tl_r ] .",
    "let the subsystems @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 consist of respectively @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 nodes with @xmath25 .",
    "we associate the hilbert spaces @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with respectively @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath3",
    ".    the state of the whole system @xmath18 is described by the density matrix @xmath29 with elements @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are multi - indices , @xmath33 , while the states of the subsystems @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 are described by the proper reduced matrices : @xmath34 the obvious necessary condition for the complete information transfer is @xmath35 , because namely this case guarantees that the number of free elements in the matrix @xmath7 does not exceed the number of free elements in the matrix @xmath36 .",
    "let the evolution of the system be governed by some hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "then the spin dynamics is described by the density matrix @xmath38 , which is the solution to the liouville equation ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this solution reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the initial density matrix .",
    "we say that the information , which is initially ( at @xmath1 ) encoded into the state of @xmath0 ( i.e. all elements of the initial density matrix @xmath8 ) , is completely ( partially ) transfered to the subsystem @xmath3 at the instant @xmath9 if it may be completely ( partially ) extracted from the analysis of the density matrix @xmath10 at instant @xmath16 .",
    "it is obvious that the information transfer requires some relations between the elements of the density matrices @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "eq.([rhot ] ) means that these relations are linear , and they may be schematically written as the following matrix equation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a linear operator depending on a particular instant @xmath16 .",
    "assume the existence of such operator @xmath45 that @xmath46 if @xmath45 may be uniquely constructed , then the information is completely transfered from @xmath0 to @xmath3 at the instant @xmath9 , i.e. all elements of @xmath8 can be uniquely constructed .",
    "if @xmath45 is not unique , then the information is partially transfered from @xmath0 to @xmath3 ( we may not uniquely find all elements of the matrix @xmath8 in this case ) .",
    "if @xmath45 does not exists , then the information may not be transfered at the instant @xmath16 .",
    "thus we relate the possibility to completely ( partially ) transfer the information from the sender @xmath0 to the receiver @xmath3 with the condition of unique ( non - unique ) resolvability of the linear system ( [ rhot ] ) with respect to the elements of the initial density matrix of the sender @xmath47 , which is a well known condition of the linear algebra .",
    "note , that the perfect state transfer from the sender @xmath0 to receiver @xmath3 @xcite corresponds to the very special form of the linear operator @xmath44 , namely @xmath48 , which has been used in the above references as well as in other references concerning either the ideal or the high probability state transfer @xcite ( note that the density matrix @xmath47 is not completely arbitrary in those references because it is associated with the pure state of the one - node sender ; the sender and the receiver are respectively the first and the last nodes of the spin chains ) . of course , the condition for the unique resolvability of the system ( [ rhot ] ) with respect to the elements of the density matrix @xmath47 is valid because @xmath49 in this case .",
    "but this condition may be valid even if the condition for the perfect state transfer is not verified .",
    "for this reason we may conclude that the condition for the perfect state transfer is embedded into the condition for the complete information transfer . as a consequence",
    ", the information transfer may be organized in a much simpler way then the ideal state transfer . to give more details regarding this conclusion",
    ", we consider a particular example of the communication system , where both the sender @xmath0 and the receiver @xmath3 consist of a single spin-1/2 particle .",
    "generalization to the sender ( receiver ) consisting of more number of particles is straightforward .",
    "let the first and the @xmath19th nodes be sender @xmath0 and receiver @xmath3 respectively , i.e. @xmath50 we derive the condition , for which the elements of @xmath51 may be found from the known elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath10 at some instant @xmath11 .",
    "then we demonstrate that this condition is much less restrictive then the condition for the ideal transfer of the initial state @xmath47 to the receiver @xmath3 at some instant @xmath16 .",
    "first , we write @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the elements of the matrix @xmath55 , which is the matrix @xmath56 reduced with respect to the sender @xmath0 : @xmath57 .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath5 reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 the information about @xmath8 may be completely extracted from @xmath60 at some instant @xmath9 if the system ( [ rho_red2 ] ) may be uniquely solved with respect to the elements of the density matrix @xmath8 at the instant @xmath16 . in other words , one has single scalar condition @xmath61 on the other hand , the conditions for the ideal state transfer at the instants @xmath62 read @xmath63 which is a system of @xmath64 scalar equations .",
    "namely in this case eq.([rho_red2 ] ) reduces to the identity @xmath65 .",
    "emphasize that the condition for the complete information transfer ( [ it ] ) is valid in this case , because the matrix @xmath66 in formula ( [ tr ] ) becomes the @xmath67 unit matrix : @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , condition ( [ pst ] ) is a _ very particular realization _ of condition ( [ det ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the conditions of the perfect state transfer ( i.e. system([pst ] ) ) are embedded in the condition of the complete information transfer ( [ it ] ) .",
    "eq.([it ] ) states that the complete information transfer is impossible only at such time moments @xmath69 that @xmath70 this remark suggests us to formulate the principal difference between conditions ( [ it ] ) and ( [ pst ] ) as follows : there is a set of instants @xmath71 ( solutions to eq.([det_0 ] ) ) , when the complete information transfer _ is impossible _ , whereas there is another set of instants @xmath62 ( solutions to the conditions ( [ pst ] ) ) when the perfect state transfer _ is possible_. this simple and straightforward analysis allows one to conclude that the complete information transfer may be organized much simpler than the perfect state transfer . if the condition ( [ it ] ) is not satisfied , than the rank of the matrix @xmath72 in formula ( [ it ] ) is less then four , so that only part of information about the density matrix @xmath47 may be obtained from the analysis of the density matrix @xmath10 .",
    "now we consider the information transfer in more details and give a different form to the condition ( [ it ] ) for the unique resolvability of the system ( [ rho_red2 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we remark that there are only three arbitrary real parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , in the original one - qubit matrix @xmath8 , which parametrize all elements of @xmath8 as follows ( hereafter @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 being the density matrix , @xmath7 must be a positive - semidefinite matrix , so that the values of the parameters @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) are restricted by the condition @xmath78 . taking into account that @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( were the star means the complex conjugate value ) , we reduce the system of four linear equations ( [ rho_red2 ] ) to the equivalent system of three linear equations for the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 : @xmath81 here @xmath82 we see that the information about the initial state of sender ( i.e. the elements of @xmath8 ) may be completely extracted from @xmath10 if the system ( [ a ] ) is uniquely solvable for @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "this unique resolvability requires @xmath83 if condition ( [ deta ] ) is satisfied at some instant @xmath16 ( which means that @xmath84 ) , then the complete information about @xmath8 may be obtained from @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath85 , then we may obtain only partial information about @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath86 , then no information may be extracted from the subsystem @xmath3 at the instant @xmath16 . the later is possible only if @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , one should remark that , in principle , the instants in three equations ( [ a ] ) may be different",
    ". an important component of the information transfer is the initial state @xmath88 .",
    "it seemed out that not any @xmath88 allows the complete information transfer , which is shown in sec.[section : n4 ] ( see the text after eq.([h4 ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath88 might have the following form : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this case corresponds , for instance , to the initial state described by the following wave function @xmath92 is the state of the subsystem @xmath0 and @xmath93 is the state of the subsystem @xmath94 .",
    "thus @xmath95 the initial state ( [ in ] ) with the one - qubit wave function @xmath96 and @xmath97 is used in the usual problem of the quantum state transfer along the spin-1/2 chain @xcite .",
    "[ section : example1 ]     as is shown above , there are no rigorous special requirements to the initial density matrix @xmath98 as well as to the evolution operator @xmath99 in order to organize complete information transfer , whereas these requirements are very rigorous in the case of perfect state transfer . nevertheless , it is important to know , which hamiltonian is preferable in the process of information transfer and what the appropriate initial state of the subsystem @xmath94 might be used .",
    "considering examples of the information transfer along the short spin-1/2 chains , we show that the xy - hamiltonian is a proper one .",
    "of course , all settings taken for perfect state transfer may be applied for the organization of complete information transfer .",
    "but we show that the complete information transfer may be realized even in the cases when the perfect state transfer is impossible , see example of the four - node homogeneous spin chain in sec.[section : n4 ] .",
    "let the initial density matrix be representable in the form ( [ dp ] ) .",
    "we consider the open homogeneous spin-1/2 chain of @xmath19 nodes governed by the hamiltonian @xmath100 using the nearest neighbor interaction approximation : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the coupling constant between the nearest neighbors , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , are the projection operators of the total spin angular momentum .",
    "thus , the evolution operator reads : @xmath106 let us consider the initial state in the form ( [ dp ] ) with an arbitrary initial density matrix of sender @xmath8 and two types of initial density matrix @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , are larmor frequencies . the initial state ( [ rho01 ] ) corresponds to the usual arbitrary quantum state transfer problem @xcite , while the initial state ( [ rho02 ] ) is the thermal equilibrium state of the subsystem @xmath94 with the hamiltonian @xmath111 .",
    "it will be noted in sec.[section : n4 ] that not any set of @xmath109 in hamiltonian ( [ th ] ) is suitable for the complete information transfer .",
    "let @xmath112 , so that the @xmath20 consists of a single node similar to @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the information can be completely transfered , for instance , if @xmath113 or @xmath114 where @xmath115 the evolution of the whole system is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath112 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath107 is given by eq.([n3rho01 ] ) we obtain the following nonzero elements of @xmath72 , see eq.([t ] ) ( we use the standard basis of vectors @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) : @xmath120 it is remarkable that at the instant @xmath121 such that @xmath122 we have @xmath123 thus , applying the local unitary transformation to the state of the receiver at the instant @xmath121 we obtain the initial state of the sender . in other words",
    ", we have the perfect state transfer from the first to the last node of the three node spin chain .",
    "this result coincides with @xcite .",
    "of course , the perfect state transfer means that the information is completely transferred from the subsystem @xmath0 to the subsystem @xmath3 .",
    "however , the information about @xmath8 may be extracted at different instants using the results of sec.[section : ev ] .",
    "the only requirement to the time moment is predicted by condition ( [ deta ] ) , which reads in our case : @xmath124 here @xmath125 are defined in eqs.([at ] ) with @xmath126 given by expressions ( [ h3 t ] ) .",
    "eq.([a3 ] ) means that the information may not be completely transfered only at the discrete set of time moments .",
    "let @xmath127 .",
    "the information can be completely transfered if , for instance , @xmath128 or @xmath129 where @xmath130 evolution of the whole system is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath127 .",
    "it is important that @xmath131 , because otherwise @xmath132 and the information may not be completely transfered to the last node in this case .    in the case of the initial density matrix @xmath107 given by eq.([n4rho01 ] ) , one has the following nonzero elements of @xmath72 , see eq.([t ] ) : @xmath133 the perfect state transfer is impossible in this case , which agrees with @xcite .",
    "however , the complete information about @xmath8 may be extracted at some instant @xmath16 using the results of sec.[section : ev ] .",
    "condition ( [ deta ] ) reads @xmath134 here @xmath125 are defined in eqs.([at ] ) with @xmath126 given by expressions ( [ h4 t ] ) .",
    "eq.([a4 ] ) means that the information , in principle , can be extracted almost at any time moment , except the discrete set of instants , given by condition ( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "let us compare the perfect state transfer with the complete information transfer from the information extraction point of view .",
    "one should underline that both are very similar .",
    "in fact , as is mentioned in the introduction , the extraction of information from the receiver @xmath36 is not needed if this information is an  intermediate ",
    "one which is supposed to be used as data for the subsequent quantum computations .",
    "then no additional operation is required , because , in both cases , all information about @xmath8 is represented in @xmath10 . however , the extraction of information is necessary in the case of the communication systems , when one might need to read this information from the receiver and use in the classical devises hereafter .",
    "the information may be read by the quantum tomography tool .",
    "this holds for both cases ( the perfect state transfer and the complete information transfer ) . only if we need to transfer a single parameter of the density matrix ( say @xmath135 , like it takes place in the perfect state transfer considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ) one can be satisfied with a simple measurement of polarization on the receiver of a communication system .",
    "hereafter we represent the method of information extraction from the receiver .",
    "we see that in order to find @xmath73 from the system ( [ a ] ) one has to know elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath10 .",
    "the problem of reconstruction of its elements is a quantum tomography problem @xcite .",
    "we use a method for construction of the elements of @xmath10 based on the polarization measurements @xcite .",
    "let us consider the multi - channel communication system with the non - interacting channels whose number equal to the number of arbitrary parameters in the density matrix @xmath8 , i.e. three channels for the one - qubit density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "each channel is equivalent to that represented in fig.[fig : s_tl_r ] .",
    "all channels have the same initial state and the spin dynamics is governed by the same hamiltonian in each channel . to find the elements of @xmath8 we measure the average polarizations @xmath136 on the receivers of all channels ( @xmath137 ) at some instant @xmath16 in some directions @xmath138 ( here @xmath139 , @xmath137 , and @xmath140 are positive parameters ) : @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( @xmath105 ) is the projection of the @xmath19th spin ( receiver ) on the axis @xmath143 , @xmath144 are pauli matrices . substituting @xmath145 into eq.([in ] )",
    "we transform this equation into the following one : @xmath146 we see that the average polarization @xmath136 contains the information about all elements of @xmath10 .",
    "similar to the matrix @xmath8 , all elements of the matrix @xmath10 may be written in terms of three real parameters : @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 . therefore",
    ", if one can uniquely solve the system ( [ j ] ) with respect to these parameters , then we will be able to express all elements of the density matrix @xmath10 in terms of the polarizations @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "the unique resolvability condition for the system ( [ j ] ) reads @xmath150 finally , we derive the relation between @xmath73 ( parameters of the density matrix @xmath8 ) and polarizations @xmath136 .    for this purpose ,",
    "we eliminate elements of the density matrix @xmath10 from the rhs of eq.([j ] ) using eqs.([a ] ) : @xmath151 where @xmath152 the system of three equations ( [ jj2 ] ) is uniquely solvable for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , if @xmath153 only in this case we are able to obtain the complete information about the initial state @xmath8 . if @xmath154 , then not all elements of the matrix @xmath8 may be uniquely found ( partial information transfer ) . and",
    "no information may be transfered if @xmath155 .",
    "the system ( [ b2 ] ) is equivalent to the system ( [ deta ] ) .",
    "remark that coefficients @xmath156 in the multi - channel communication system characterize the evolution operator @xmath99 , the initial state @xmath107 ( through @xmath125 ) and the directions of the measured polarizations ( through @xmath140 ) .",
    "we may state that the proper choice of the evolution operator and the initial state provides the information transfer , while the proper choice of the directions of polarization measurements provides the extraction of the transfered information .",
    "for instance , let the initial state of each channel is described by the following density matrix @xmath157 let , for instance , @xmath158 then the system ( [ bb ] ) defining coefficients @xmath159 in the linear system ( [ jj2 ] ) reads @xmath160 then eq.([b2 ] ) yields : @xmath161 , so that condition ( [ b2 ] ) coincides with condition ( [ deta ] ) . therefore the measurements of polarizations in three mutually orthogonal directions @xmath162 fixed by parameters ( [ a ] ) may be used for obtaining the elements of the matrix @xmath8 from the matrix @xmath10 .",
    "note that the examples of three- and four - node chains considered above may be realized using the three channel scheme considered in this subsection .",
    "due to the quantum interactions , the information concentrated initially in a part of a quantum system ( which is called the sender @xmath0 ) becomes distributed over the whole system .",
    "thus , it may be completely extracted from another part of a quantum system ( which is called the receiver @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , we may transfer the information from @xmath0 to @xmath3 .",
    "the important property of such transfer is that it is not sensitive to the initial state of the system as well as to the particular type of quantum interactions .",
    "we arrange this transfer along the three- and four - node chain with nearest - neighbor interactions governed by the xy hamiltonian .",
    "however there is no restrictions on the length of the chain as well as on the type of hamiltonian , provided that condition ( [ deta ] ) is satisfied .",
    "we show that the elements of @xmath8 may be extracted from the elements of @xmath10 at some instant @xmath16 using the multi - channel communication system with the proper polarization measurements at the receivers of these channels .",
    "finally we emphasize that the necessity to resolve the linear system ( i.e. eq.([a ] ) ) should not be considered as an essential disadvantage of the information transfer approach in comparison with the perfect state transfer .",
    "this is especially valid in the case of quantum computation algorithms .",
    "in fact , one has to remember , that the algorithms for quantum computation must be able to handle the non - unitary transformations because basic mathematical transformations ( such as addition and multiplication ) are not unitary ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , the solution to the linear system ( like the system ( [ a ] ) ) is one of the central problems of the mathematical calculations . of cause",
    ", the algorithms of quantum computation must be able to resolve such a problem .",
    "we also emphasize that the condition for the perfect state transfer is embedded into the condition for the complete information transfer .",
