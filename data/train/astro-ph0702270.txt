    "presents a frequency spectrum with a range of excited modes .",
    "because most of the proper modes are excited , mode identification for each frequency is considerably easier than for other types of pulsating stars @xcite .",
    "modelling these stars can be difficult as there are often multiple sets of parameters that fit the observations . also , if we use the frequencies to determine the mass of the star , then any solution we find may be incorrect as it depends on the _ fit _ mass .",
    "if we could determine the mass of the star through some other means , then modelling the frequencies would be easier , _ and _ they could also then be used solely to characterize the internal structure of the star .",
    "unfortunately the precise determination of mass is normally possible only for detached components of similar mass in spectroscopic binary systems . for single stars we use observables such as magnitudes and colors ( apart from oscillation frequencies ) to estimate the mass .",
    "however , now that there are various possibilites of measuring a radius for single stars through interferometry @xcite the question then arises : can radius be used to determine the mass of the star ?",
    "recent studies have shown interferometry has determined the radius of a star with a precision of about 1% for the brightest stars and it has been suggested that we might obtain a precision of at least 4% for most nearby solar - type stars whose diameters we could expect to measure @xcite .",
    "our interest is exploring how this independent measure complements oscillation frequency information for solar - type stars .",
    "can it determine the mass of the star ? and if so , can we then use the frequencies to probe the physics of the star ? how important is the radius for determining other stellar parameters such as age and chemical composition ? what is the impact on the expected uncertainties ? now that we are expecting frequency errors less than about 1.0@xmath3hz with the launch of corot @xcite and kepler @xcite , does this have an effect on our results ?    while the objective of this study is mainly to determine stellar mass , we also discuss results for other stellar parameters .",

    "they are responsible for determining both the radius and the mass of the star .",
    "we then included @xmath37 , _ two _ @xmath52 and _ one _ @xmath53 in the previous set of observables .",
    "figure  [ fig - signif_obs ] ( lower panel ) illustrates how the relative information content in each @xmath50 changes .",
    "there are two notable changes : ( 1 ) @xmath41 and @xmath48 contain almost no information while both the observed @xmath37 and @xmath52 become responsible for determining the true radius ( and mass ) of the star , ( 2 ) s@xmath67 and s(@xmath46m / h@xmath47 $ ] ) decrease by a small amount indicating that the information from colors and metallicity is not contained in the new observables .",
    "we believe this information is primarily the chemical composition .",
    "this implies that either colors or a metallicity are important observables to have when complementing seismic and radius measurements .",
    "we also note that while s@xmath67 decreases by @xmath68 , s@xmath49 remains the same .",
    "we included more than one @xmath52 to highlight how when we change the measurement errors , the information contained in one observable is passed to another , in particular , between @xmath37 and @xmath52 . if we had included just one @xmath52 , then s(@xmath52 )  @xmath69  s(@xmath53 )  @xmath691 .",
    "when there are two observables contributing similar ( but not the same ) information , the content gets spread among them .",
    "similarly , with three @xmath52 , s(@xmath52 ) @xmath69 0.55 .",
    "figure  [ fig - signif_dlv ] illustrates this .",
    "s(@xmath52 ) ( bold dashed line ) and s(@xmath37 ) ( bold continuous lines ) are shown as a function of @xmath70 with @xmath71hz .",
    "at the smallest @xmath70 , s(@xmath37)@xmath691 .",
    "increasing @xmath70 causes s(@xmath37 ) to decrease , while s(@xmath52 ) increases because it is taking over its role .",
    "the non - bold lines show the same but for @xmath72hz .",
    "there is a similar but slower trend , because the radius remains more important than @xmath52 even for higher values of @xmath70 .",
    "using only one @xmath52 would not show an increase in s(@xmath52 ) because it would be already near 1 , but s(@xmath37 ) would decrease more slowly , while observables such as @xmath41 and @xmath48 would increase in importance .",
    "both figures  [ fig - signif_obs ] and [ fig - signif_dlv ] show that the relative importance of observables depends not only on the individual @xmath51 but also on the combination of @xmath50 available , and that there is no straightforward relationship between a set of @xmath50 and the parameters they are responsible for constraining .",
    "the combination of observables we use is important for the independence of the parameters . in general",
    ", there should be a unique set of frequencies for every possible combination of @xmath36 .",
    "however , we are not using individual @xmath54 but frequency separations for the reasons explained in section  [ sec - observables ]",
    ". this creates some dependencies among the parameters such as that between @xmath9 and @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 and @xmath9 and @xmath33 . with the addition of measurement errors ,",
    "this degeneracy between different parameter combinations becomes worse .    to illustrate some of the dependencies among the parameters , we calculated @xmath17 surfaces for two parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 while keeping the other parameters fixed at their correct values .",
    "we evaluate 68.3% , 90% and 99% confidence levels as defined for a two - dimensional @xmath17 i.e. @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "we used @xmath70 = 0.01 r@xmath76 and @xmath77 = 1.3@xmath3hz and defined @xmath78 .    using a set of @xmath54",
    "as observables the 99% confidence region encircled the correct parameter values to within less than 1% of each of the corresponding parameters ( it produced almost a dot centered on its true value ) , supporting the idea that each set of parameters should produce a unique set of @xmath54 .    to show an example of the dependencies introduced by using the frequency separations , figure  [ fig - chi2_ma_30 ] illustrates the correlated @xmath17 surface for mass and @xmath2 while holding ( @xmath1 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 ) fixed at their true values using os3 ( see section  [ sec - properrors ] ) .",
    "clearly for any value of @xmath9 there is a corresponding @xmath2 that will give a minimum @xmath17 value .",
    "we hope that a minimization will lead to accurate values , but we may need additional observables to help constrain the solution .      can we get a precise determination of the mass using a radius measurement ? how well do we need to know our observables ? will the effort of obtaining an interferometric diameter be outweighed by the benefits , or can some other observable produce a similar result ?",
    "to answer these questions , we investigated the expected parameter uncertainties through equation ( [ eqn - covariance ] ) for various observables with different errors . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall discuss three sets of observables :    @xmath79 , \\bar{\\delta \\nu } , \\bar{\\delta \\nu}\\},\\ ] ] @xmath80,\\delta \\nu_{\\rm n , l } \\}\\ ] ] and @xmath81,\\delta \\nu_{\\rm n , l } , \\delta \\nu_{\\rm n , l } \\}\\ ] ] for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "for os2 and os3 we include a total of 21 large frequency separations , where we have assumed that we can not identify every consecutive mode for each @xmath59 and thus have even fewer frequency separations . for os3",
    "we also include 5 small frequency separations .",
    "we remind readers that the parameter uncertainty is denoted by @xmath30 while the measurement errors are denoted by @xmath29 .    for ease of reading we shall refer to @xmath84hz as ln and 1.3@xmath3hz as hn .",
    "figure  [ fig - theoretical_errors ] shows the theoretical uncertainties on each of the parameters as a function of @xmath70 .",

    "the dashed lines show the results for os1 .",
    "the continuous lines show os2 , and the dotted lines show os3 .    for all parameters",
    "we find that @xmath85 ( parameter uncertainty ) is a function of @xmath70 for all combinations of observables .",
    "we also see that for @xmath9 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 the different observable combinations and errors do not impact significantly the theoretical uncertainties for @xmath86 . only for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , using os2 instead of os1 may not always be beneficial .",
    "this is because @xmath87 is excluded from os2 and this observable is essential for determining @xmath1 and , as it turns out , @xmath2 too .",
    "* _ mass _ : whatever combination we choose , we find that for @xmath86 @xmath88 does not change .",
    "a radius measurement will always be more important than seismic information once we reach a precision of this order . as the radius error begins to increase",
    ", its relative weight for mass determination decreases , while the relative weight of the seismic information increases .",
    "the quantitative differences between using ln and hn for each observable combination for @xmath89 supports the idea that seismic information is the dominant contributor to the reduction of the uncertainty in mass at higher @xmath70 . *",
    "_ age _ : either a reduction in frequency error or an increase in observables significantly affects @xmath90 .",
    "os1 and os3 do not benefit significantly from the radius measurement , but both produce better constraints on the age than os2 .",
    "this is precisely because they contain @xmath87 which is fundamental in constraining this parameter .",
    "however , for os2 a precise radius measurement reduces @xmath90 by 200% for ln and hn .",
    "the lack of the observable @xmath0 forces @xmath37 to constrain the age .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that if we use ln instead of hn for all observable combinations there is a large improvement in @xmath90 .",
    "* _ x _ : adding observables and obtaining smaller frequency errors leads to subtle differences in @xmath91 for low radius error .",
    "os1 with either ln or hn produce very similar constraints on @xmath33 .",
    "using os2 does not change @xmath91 very much for @xmath86 . at larger values , we find that the additional large frequency separations ( especially for ln ) constrain @xmath33 to about 10% , an improvement of a factor of 2 over hn . os3+hn and",
    "os2+ln produce similar results , indicating that it is not the presence of @xmath87 specifically that is important , just the addition of ( seismic ) observables .",
    "* _ z _ : this is one of the parameters that is least influenced by either radius or seismic observables .",
    "it is mainly constrained by @xmath46m / h@xmath47 $ ] , but because this implies knowing @xmath33 , other observables play a role in constraining this parameter .",
    "radius is most important for @xmath35 when we use os1 , because we have less information available . using os2 and",
    "os3 decreases the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , with os3+ln , we find that the radius has almost no role in constraining @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath35 , the radius is important only when there is not enough information available .",
    "as we increase the number of seismic observables , this information supercedes the role of the radius .",
    "we also find that whatever combination we use , @xmath92 never decreases below 10% even using ln . * @xmath2 : the determination of @xmath2 seems to be more complex than the determination of any other parameter . in general , the addition of observables ( in number ) coupled with better frequency errors leads to lower parameter uncertainties .",
    "this is not always the case for @xmath2 .",
    "os2 is least influenced by a reduction in radius error .",
    "in fact , we find for hn , os1 gives better constraints on @xmath2 than os2 for @xmath93 .",
    "only when an observable set contains the small frequency separation and for small values of radius error , do we get a significant decrease in the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath2 .",
    "using ln instead of hn always affects the determination of @xmath94 , but more so for os2 when the radius information is less important than the frequency information .",
    "the role of the radius sometimes depends on what other information is available .",
    "for example , if we seem to be _ missing _ information , then improving the radius error will lead to a corresponding reduction in the uncertainty of some parameter , like @xmath35 .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 shows an interesting trend . a precise radius determination _ complements _ precise frequencies .",
    "either of these alone does improve the uncertainty , but both together have a larger impact on @xmath94 . clearly for @xmath95 the choice of observable set does not change @xmath88 ; it is @xmath37 which dominates the mass determination .",
    "are these uncertainty values worth the observing time ?",
    "we compared the propagated error using os2 with @xmath96 ( magnitude ) instead of @xmath37 ( radius ) to see whether @xmath96 could produce results similar to @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath96 is the only other measurement that might constrain the mass as @xmath37 does .",
    "figure  [ fig - mag_v_mass ] shows @xmath88 as a function of both @xmath70 ( continuous lines ) and @xmath97 ( dashed lines ) for two @xmath98 $ ] for ln ( left panel ) and hn ( right panel ) .",
    "we have attempted to scale the expected errors on both observables so that the quoted errors are comparable in terms of measurement difficulty .",
    "we chose @xmath70 = 0.01 r@xmath76 ( @xmath99 ) to be similar to @xmath100 mag .",
    "for both cases @xmath88 using @xmath96 will never reach the precision that a radius measurement allows .",
    "the smallest mass uncertainty using @xmath96 is @xmath101 , while if we use @xmath37 it reaches below 1% .",
    "also @xmath96 needs to be complemented with other good observables such as @xmath38 and ln to get this precision , whereas @xmath37 is a completely independent measurement that does not need the help of other observables .",
    "these are two very clear reasons for choosing to obtain an interferometric measurement of diameter . for hn ( right panel )",
    "it is even clearer that @xmath37 is most important .",
    "even if our scaling is incorrect for the comparison of magnitude and radius errors , it is unlikely that an @xmath96 measurement will have a precision of better than 0.05 mag , in which case the smallest mass uncertainty is really above 7% .",
    "to test the validity of the theoretical results presented in section  [ sec - properrors ] we performed simulations and tried to fit the observables to recover the input parameters .",
    "part of this work also involved finding a reliable method to apply to any set of observables so that we could succesfully estimate the parameters of the star within the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we use two methods : direct inversions and minimizations .",
    "the direct inversions provide a test for the linear approximation of equation  ( [ eqn - taylor ] ) by using an initial guess of the parameters * x@xmath4 * and equation  ( [ eqn - solution ] ) .",
    "we did this only for os1 .",
    "minimizations iteratively incorporate a modified version of equation  [ eqn - solution ] ( levenberg - marquardt algorithm ) and were performed with os1 , os2 and os3 .",

    "table [ tbl - observables ] provides the errors , and @xmath113 .",
    "direct inversions will allow us to investigate the natural weight that @xmath37 and its error have on the determination of @xmath9 , because we do not use a minimization algorithm but just the linear approximation and equation  ( [ eqn - solution ] ) .",
    "for each radius and frequency error , we generated a total of 100 simulations of the observables .",
    "we obtained a list of @xmath114 from a grid of models ( section  [ sec - modelgrids ] ) and chose the first set from this list to be the initial guess . for most of the simulations ,",

    "the precision of the parameters are better than the theoretical ones ( figures  [ fig - theoretical_errors],[fig - simul_errors_obs1 ] ) .",
    "there is a clear dependence of the uncertainties on the radius error when @xmath70 @xmath119 3% . unlike the theoretical uncertainties , for larger @xmath70 there is no significant degradation in the precision of the parameters",
    "this uncertainty - error dependence changes drastically for larger @xmath70 because the minimization method is forcing a balance between the errors and the observations , unlike when we use the simple linear approximation ( equation  [ eqn - solution ] ) .",
    "since we are introducing more frequency observables in os2 and os3 , we are effectively giving less weight to the radius measurement for constraining the parameters .",
    "the fit parameters are thus more sensitive to the initial parameter estimates .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use small grids of models to obtain a good initial guess , and then let the minimization algorithm fit all of the observables .",
    "we created grids of models that span the five dimensional model space over a range of values that encompass about 10 - 30% on either side of the parameter values given in table  [ tbl - parameters ] .",
    "these values covered @xmath120 m@xmath76 , @xmath121 gyr , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we divided each of the parameter ranges into five ( ten for mass ) , and calculated models for each of these points , and then interpolated only along the mass for a much finer grid .",
    "we are restricting the range in mass , age and @xmath35 , but we assume that we can constrain the parameters within this range from the observables .",
    "we later extended the mass range to be between 0.75 and 1.20 m@xmath76 to investigate whether our original parameter range was too restricted .",
    "using @xmath125 and varying mass , we used the grids to see how well we could recover the mass in this extended mass range .",
    "these parameters were chosen to test for any biases introduced by selecting our original ranges to be nearly symmetric about the correct values .",
    "we tested this for @xmath70 = 0.02 r@xmath76 and hn only .",

    "for the other parameters , the fit values are not as well determined ( we havent interpolated for them ) .",
    "this appears to be responsible for the offset in fit mass .",
    "initial estimates of the parameters were obtained from the model grids .",
    "we added a constant of 0.02 to the initial estimate of @xmath33 for two reasons : 1 ) @xmath33 had always shown a systematic offset when using the model grids and , 2 ) if the value of @xmath17 from our initial estimates is too low , the minimization algorithm may not search among all possible solutions .",
    "we then allowed the code to minimize in all available observables .",
    "the solution usually converged within four iterations .",
    "we set the @xmath128 tolerance level to be 0.1 , where @xmath17 is calculated from equation  ( [ eqn - chi2 ] ) , but we used 3@xmath29 errors for the process instead of 1@xmath29 , and @xmath129 where @xmath60 is the number of degrees of freedom .",

    "@xmath88 is clearly dependent on @xmath70 for @xmath131 errors .",
    "if we reach 0.1% in radius error , then we can determine the mass to better than 1% .",
    "for @xmath132 , @xmath88 does not change significantly .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig - sim_alpha_tau ] . for @xmath70@xmath133 ,",
    "there is little difference between the uncertainties arising from the minimizations ( and more observables ) or the linear approximation with 5 observables ( figures  [ fig - di_simulationresults],[fig - simul_errors_obs1 ] ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering that for small radius errors , this observable has such a large weight that it determines uniquely the mass value . in this regime",
    ", the different combinations of observables do not have any influence , just as the theoretical uncertainties showed ( figure  [ fig - theoretical_errors ] top panel ) .",
    "so whether we use a minimization method with 26 observables or a direct inversion with only 5 observables , having a well measured radius will uniquely determine the mass .",
    "when the relative weight of the radius decreases , i.e. its error increases , other observables begin to play a role .",
    "this is why we see a dramatic change in the mass uncertainty between using os1 , os2 and os3 when @xmath70 @xmath134 ( figures  [ fig - di_simulationresults],[fig - simulations_all ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - sim_alpha_tau ] shows the standard deviations for all of the parameters .",
    "the dashed lines represent the results for os3+ln and the dotted line for os3+hn ( continuous are os2+hn ) . for @xmath9 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 the results did not change significantly .",
    "* the top panel illustrates @xmath90 .",
    "the values are rather high , but the standard deviations that result from a star of 4 gyr ( instead of 1 gyr ) have similar absolute values and thus much smaller relative values .",
    "note the qualitative differences between the set of observables with @xmath0 ( dashed and dotted lines ) and the set without ( continuous line ) .",
    "even if we use 21 large frequency separations with the precision of ln , we do not get the same age uncertainty as when we use os3 .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath0 is crucial for obtaining a precise determination of the age ( or stellar evolutionary stage ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . for @xmath70 @xmath135",
    "we also see a slight drop in @xmath90 .",
    "this is because for small radius errors , we get precise determinations of both @xmath9 and @xmath33 , so the range of possible ages that fit @xmath0 is restricted , and hence we get better age determinations . *",
    "the lower panel shows the standard deviations of all of the other parameters .",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath2 exhibit a small @xmath70 dependence : 9 - 12% for @xmath35 and 7 - 10% for @xmath2 over the radius error range .",
    "theory ( figure  [ fig - theoretical_errors ] ) predicted that @xmath92 would never fall below 10% , and increase only slightly to 12 - 14% at larger radius errors .",
    "this trend is clearly consistent with the simulation results .",
    "@xmath94 was predicted to be 20 - 22% over the range of radius error for os2+hn and 8 - 14% for os2+ln .",
    "the simulations show no significant differences between these observable combinations . for os3+ln , theory predicted 4 - 12% uncertainties , comparable to the dashed line in figure  [ fig - sim_alpha_tau ] .",
    "@xmath94 benefits significantly from the additional @xmath0 reaching a precision of about 4% and slowly degrading with @xmath70 until @xmath70 = 3% when it levels off at a @xmath30 value comparable to the other observable combinations .",
    "@xmath91 shows a dependence on radius error similar to @xmath88 . for @xmath70 @xmath136",
    "we generally estimate @xmath33 to within 2 - 3% . for larger radius errors , @xmath91 does not increase , indicating the redundancy of a radius measurement after @xmath70 = 3% .",
    "while some parameters may not seem very dependent on @xmath70 , having a radius observable allows us to estimate some parameters correctly .",
    "this in turn leads to a better estimation of the other _ non - radius dependent _ parameters because of the more restricted acceptable range .",
    "these results stem from an automatic method of fitting the observations .",
    "given that there is no human input , we are confident in the results and expect that even more precise results will be possible by paying attention to each individual case , and individual observable @xmath17 values .",
    "we investigated the role that a precisely measured radius , such as that obtained through interferometry , has on the determination of the mass of a star .",
    "we also looked at how radius and oscillation frequencies work together to determine other stellar parameters .",
    "* we found that the importance of a radius measurement depends on the combination of the available observables _ and _ their corresponding errors .",
    "for some typical observables such as @xmath37 and @xmath52 , we can expect a mass uncertainty of between 1 and 4% for @xmath70 between 0.1 and 3% ( keeping in mind that these numbers stem from an automatic parameter search and in a real case study we would pay more attention to each observable and can expect better precision . ) for @xmath70 @xmath136 the mass is uniquely determined by the radius observable , allowing us to use the frequencies just to probe the stellar interior .",
    "* our simulation errors are consistent with the theoretical errors when we use the linear approximation ( figure [ fig - di_simulationresults ] ) . using a minimization method yields smaller than predicted uncertainties with similar qualitative results for all values of radius error , but particularly when @xmath132 . for these values ,",
    "the weight of the radius measurement decreases , allowing other observables to play a greater role in the determination of the parameters .",
    "the minimization method allows an optimal trade - off between all observables and their corresponding errors .",
    "* we emphasize the importance of understanding how each observable contributes to the determination of each parameter .",
    "for example , if we want to get an estimate of @xmath35 better than 10% we need a more precise @xmath46m / h@xmath47 $ ]",
    ". a radius measurement would not be useful . to correctly determine age ( or stellar evolution stage )",
    "it is crucial to observe @xmath0 .",
    "even with 21 large frequency spacings , we will not determine the age to the precision that 1 small frequency spacing will provide .",
    "it is also interesting that @xmath0 coupled with a small radius error had a strong impact on the precision of the mixing - length parameter @xmath2 .",
    "* we know that a discrepancy exists between the observed and the model frequencies , which leads to a systematic offset in mass determination ( e.g. miglio & montalbn 2005 ) . by allowing the radius to determine the mass",
    ", we have the advantage that 1 ) we have an independent measurement that we can use to try to resolve the discrepancy , and 2 ) by using the radius to determine mass , we can use the frequencies to probe the stellar interior .",
    "* one final remark we would like to make is how effective a radius measurement can be to detect some error in the model . during this study we conducted some _ hare and hounds _ tests .",
    "in one particular case , we found that all of the observations were fit very well except for the radius , which showed a larger than 3@xmath29 deviation value .",
    "this turned out to be the result of an incorrectly quoted metallicity meausurement ! this just shows how powerful the radius can be to detect an error / flaw , and this could possibly be used to detect a flaw in the physics of the models .",
