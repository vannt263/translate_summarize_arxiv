    "the reason for the sweeping is that even a minimum - mass solar nebula can have an important influence on the relevant precession rates .",
    "the role of the disk is to modify the precession rates . as the nebula disperses , the precession rates vary , along with the resonance locations .",
    "solid bodies , such as the terrestrial planets , can be driven into significantly eccentric and inclined orbits as these resonances pass through their orbital locations .    in another study , @xcite examined the response of a gaseous disk to secular driving by two planets that are misaligned with respect to a disk . because the precessional forcing period is long compared to the sound crossing time ,",
    "the disk response is global in the form of a large scale warp . in these previous models the precessional modes that drive the resonances are due to compact objects ( planets ) . in the secular resonance described in section [ sec : secres ] , the disk and binary companion star drive the secular resonance .    also , unlike the case examined by ward ( 1981 ) the angular momentum of the smallest mass object in the system , the planet in this paper , is not extremely small compared to the angular momentum of all other objects in the system .",

    "[ sigmaev ] . for the parameters of this model ,",
    "the standard gap opening criterion is satisfied @xcite . as shown in section [ sec : gap ] , substantial misalignment does not occur for a system without a significant gap .",
    "@xcite also found in sph simulations that substantial misalignment occurs within planet - disk systems .",
    "their simulations involve initial tilts relative to binary orbital plane of @xmath4 and @xmath240 , as were also simulated by @xcite .",

    "could be adapted to account for the binary eccentricity by modifying the coupling coefficients , while assuming the planet orbit and disk remain circular .",

    ", we may expect qualitatively similar behavior to the circular case , but do not pursue the analysis in this paper .",
    "the results of this work have several implications for giant planet gas accretion .",
    "if a planet forms in a massive misaligned disk , it will remain coplanar with the precessing disk until it becomes massive enough to open a gap in the disk . once a gap opens , the torque from the disk on the planet becomes weaker .",
    "thus , the disk and the planet orbit may not remain coplanar .",
    "the planet  disk misalignment is enhanced by the effects of the secular resonance and also the effects of disk dissipation that cause disk tilt decay towards the binary orbital plane .",
    "if the planet gains substantial mass from the disk after its tilt has decayed , the planet will become more aligned with the disk and binary .",
    "also , if terrestrial planets form at a late stage from the remains of the disk , then they may not be aligned to giant planet orbit .",

    "over the course of the oscillations , the planet and disk generally have a level of misalignment that is comparable to the initial planet ",
    "disk tilt relative to the binary orbital plane for the parameters we considered .",
    "the misalignment is aided by the effects of a secular resonance and the decay of the disk tilt to the binary orbit plane . at later times",
    ", the planet orbit can evolve towards alignment with the disk , if the planet has gained a substantial amount of mass from a disk that has become nearly aligned with the binary orbital plane .",
    "this tendency toward alignment is due to the advection of disk momentum by the planet .",
    "we determined the tilt evolution of the planet and disk by means of secular theory and sph simulations .",
    "the secular model describes the general properties of the gravitational interactions between the planet , disk , and binary that are found sph simulations .",

    "in section [ secular ] , we apply the secular theory to a planet ",
    "disk system in a binary for a nondissipative disk that lies external to the orbit a planet with a clearance that depends on the gap size .",
    "the tilts of the planet and disk undergo oscillations as the objects precess .",
    "one would expect that at very small disk mass , the disk and planet precess independently with substantial misalignment between the orbital plane of the planet relative to the disk plane .",
    "in addition one expects that for very high disk mass , the planet precession becomes locked to that of the disk with a smaller relative tilt .",
    "these expectations are realized in the secular model ( see fig .  [ deltaimass ] ) .    however , the amplitude of the relative planet ",
    "disk tilt oscillations does not vary monotonically with disk mass . as seen in figs .",
    "[ deltaimass ] and [ phasepor ] , for small disk masses , the relative planet - disk tilt oscillation amplitude increases with disk mass and reaches a peak value at a disk mass for which the planet ",
    "disk interactions are just strong enough for them to begin to precess together in a mean sense ( librate ) .",
    "that is , precession rate locking ( in a mean sense , i.e. , libration ) then does not guarantee coplanarity . just the opposite occurs . when mean precession rate locking sets in as a function of increasing disk mass , the planet  disk misalignment is largest .",
