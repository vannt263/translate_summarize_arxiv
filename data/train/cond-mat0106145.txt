    "the collision of particles with the internal degrees of freedom is inelastic in general .",
    "the inelastic collisions are abundant in nature(goldsmith , 1960 ) .",
    "examples can be seen in collisions of atoms , molecules , elastic materials , balls in sports , and so on .",
    "the study of inelastic collisions will be able to be widely accepted as one of fundamental subjects in physics , because they are almost always discussed in textbooks of elementary classical mechanics .",
    "physicists realize that inelastic collisions can be a fashionable subject in physics from recent extensive interest in granular materials(kadanoff , 1999 ; de gennes , 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , granules consist of macroscopic dissipative particles . therefore , the decision of interaction among particles is obviously important .",
    "we believe that static interactions among granular particles can be described by the theory of elasticity(love , 1927 ; landau et al . , 1960 ;",
    "johnson , 1985 ; hills et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "for example , the normal compression may be described by the hertzian contact force(hertz , 1882 ) and the shear force may be represented by the mindlin force(mindlin , 1949 ) .",
    "the dynamical part related to the dissipation , however , can not be described by any reliable physical theory .",
    "thus , the distinct element method ( cundall & struck , 1979 ) which is one of the most popular models to simulate collections of granular particles contains some dynamical undetermined parameters . in other words , to determine such the parameters is important for both granular physics and fundamental physics .",
    "the normal impact of macroscopic materials is characterized by the coefficient of restitution ( cor ) defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the relative velocities of incoming and outgoing particles respectively .",
    "cor @xmath3 had been believed to be a material constant , since the classical experiment by newton ( 1962 ) .",
    "in general , however , experiments show that cor for three dimensional materials is not a constant even in approximate sense but depends strongly on the impact velocity(goldsmith , 1960 ; sondergaard et al . , 1990 ; bridges et al . , 1984 ; supulver et al . , 1995 ; giese et al . , 1996",
    "; aspelmeier et al .",
    ", 1998 ; basile et al . , 2000 ; labous et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the origin of the dissipation in inelastic collisions is the transfer of the kinetic energy of the center of mass into the internal degrees of freedom during the impacts .",
    "systematic theoretical investigations of the impact have begun with the paper by kuwabara and kono ( 1987 ) .",
    "taking into account the viscous motion among the internal degrees of freedom , they derived the equation of the macroscopic deformation .",
    "later , brilliantov _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) and morgado and oppenheim ( 1997 ) derived the identical equation to eq.([oppenheim ] ) .",
    "in particular , the derivation by morgado and oppenheim ( 1997 ) is based on the standard technique of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to extract the slow mode among the fast many modes which can be regarded as the thermal reservoir with constant temperature ( see appendix ) .",
    "furthermore , brilliantov _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) compared their theoretical results with experimental results .",
    "thus , the quasi - static theory has been accepted as reasonable one .",
    "on the other hand , gerl and zippelius ( 1999 ) performed the microscopic simulation of the two - dimensional collision of an isothermal elastic disk with a wall .",
    "their simulation is mainly based on the mode expansion of an elastic disk under the force free boundary condition .",
    "the distinct characteristic of their model is that they do not introduce any dissipative mechanism of their microscopic equation of motion .",
    "then , they solve hamilton s equation determined by the elastic field and the repulsive potential to represent the collision of two disks .",
    "their results show that cor decreases with the impact velocity , which strongly depends on poisson s ratio . for high velocity of the impact",
    "they demonstrate the macroscopic deformation left after the collision is over .",
    "the relation between the quasi - static theory of impact ( kuwabara & kono , 1987 ; brilliantov et al .",
    ", 1996 ; morgado & oppenheim , 1997 ) and their microscopic simulation ( gerl & zippelius , 1999 ) is not trivial , because the energy transfer during the impact is not explicitly included in the quasi - static theory .",
    "thus , we have to clarify the relation between two typical approaches .    in this paper",
    ", we will perform the microscopic simulation of the impact of a two dimensional elastic disk with a wall .",
    "we introduce two methods of simulation : one is based on the lattice model ( model a ) and another is a continuum model ( model b ) which is identical to that by gerl and zippelius ( 1999 ) .",
    "both models do not include any dissipation explicitly .",
    "thus , we regard inelastic collisions take place only from the transfer of modes of oscillation . through our simulation",
    ", we will demonstrate that the elastic models do not recover the results predicted by the quasi - static theories in the low impact velocity ( kuwabara & kono 1987 ; brilliantov et al .",

    "in this section , we briefly explain the outline of the quasi - static theory . one purpose of this section is to summarize the two - dimensional version of quasi - static theory which may not be mentioned in any articles explicitly .    at first , let us summarize the three dimensional result , in which the equation of the macroscopic deformation is given by @xmath4 in a collision of two spheres . for the collision of two identical spheres the macroscopic deformation @xmath5",

    "the first term of the right hand side in eq.([oppenheim ] ) represents the hertzian contact force ( love , 1927 ; landau et al . , 1960 ; johnson , 1985 ; hertz , 1882 ) and the second term is the dissipation due to the internal motion .    the simplest derivation of eq.([oppenheim ] )",
    "is that by brilliantov _",
    "( 1986 ) , though we also check its validity by the alternative methods . taking into account the limitation of the length of this paper ,",
    "we follow the argument by them .",
    "the outline of the derivation by morgado and oppenheim ( 1997 ) is shown in appendix .",
    "the static stress tensor in a two - dimensional linear elastic material can be represented by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the shear modulus and the bulk modulus , and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 with the displacement field @xmath25 .",
    "the two dimensional hertzian contact law ( johnson , 1985 ; gerl et al . , 1999 ) is given by the relation between the macroscopic deformation of the center of mass @xmath5 and the elastic force @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is ( two - dimensional ) young s modulus .",
    "note that @xmath26 and @xmath28 do not have dimension of the force and young s modulus , because these are two dimensional variables which are the ones per unit length along the third axis .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hertz ] ) can be derived from the stress tensor ( [ ela ] ) with the standard treatment of linear elastic theory .",
    "note that @xmath5 satisfies @xmath29 with the position of the center of mass @xmath30 ( gerl & zippelius , 1999 ) .    for small dissipation , as in landau & lifshitz ( 1960 )",

    "thus , with the aid of the assumption by brilliantov _",
    "( 1996 ) , ( [ ela ] ) and ( [ vis ] ) , it is easy to derive the two dimensional version of quasi - static theory as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is not an important constant .",

    "the wall exists at @xmath40 , and the center of mass of the disk keeps the position at @xmath41 .",
    "the disk approaches from the region @xmath42 before rebounding from the wall .      the disk in model a consists of some mass points ( with the mass @xmath43 ) on a triangular lattice .",
    "all the mass points are connected with linear springs with spring constant @xmath44 . in the limit of a large number of mass points",
    ", this disk corresponds to the continuum circular disk with young s modulus @xmath45 and poisson s ratio @xmath46 ( hoover , 1991 ) . the position of each mass point of model a is governed by the following equation : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lattice constant , @xmath49 is the position of the nearest neighbor mass points of @xmath50 , @xmath43 is the mass of the mass points , @xmath51 is the @xmath52 coordinate of @xmath50 , and @xmath53 is the unit vector in the @xmath52 direction .",

    "we adopt @xmath58 for the most of simulations , but we also adopt the result of @xmath59 to obtain fig.2 , though the result is almost identical to that for @xmath60 . the exponential interaction between the disk and the wall",

    "actually , in the limit of @xmath61 , the exponential potential can be regarded as a potential of the mirror image .",

    "b , we adopt the fourth order symplectic integral method with @xmath113 . in both models ,",
    "we have checked for conservation of the total energy .",
    "we also investigate the impact with finite temperature .",
    "the temperature is introduced as follows : in model a , we prepare the maxwellian for the initial velocity distribution of mass points , where the positions of all mass points are located at their equilibrium positions . from the variance of the maxwellian",
    "we can introduce the temperature as a parameter . to perform the simulation ,",
    "we prepare 10 independent samples obeying maxwellian with the aid of normal random number . in model b , we prepare samples which satisfies gibbs states .",

    ", we prepare many samples ( 120 or 20 ) to simulate systems at finite @xmath116 .",
    "the summary of differences between model a and b is as follows : ( i ) all of the mass points in model a interact with the wall but , in model b , only the exterior boundary has the influence of the potential as in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) . we have replaced the original model a by a model in which only mass points on the boundary can interact with the wall , but we can not find significant differences in the results of our simulation in both discrete models .",
    "( ii ) model a can have nonlinear deformations , but model b is based on the theory of linear elasticity .",
    "( iii ) model a can express some plastic deformations , but model b can not .",
    "this effect will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "( iv ) model a has six fold symmetry whereas model b has only rotational symmetry .",
    "( v ) the force free boundary condition ( [ free ] ) is assumed in model b but may not be appropriate for actual situations .",
    "model a does not include such the condition .",
    "now , let us explain the details of the result of our simulation . in the first subsection , we will introduce the result at @xmath117 and in the second subsection",
    ", we will show the result at finite @xmath116 .",
    "at first , we carry out the simulation of model a and model b with the initial condition at @xmath117 ( _ i.e. _ no internal motion ) .",
    "figure 2 is the plot of the cor against the impact velocity for both model a and model b. for model a , we have adopted the fourth order runge - kutta method . to eliminate the effect of six fold symmetry of model a",
    ", we average 12 data as a function @xmath118 of the initial orientations of the disk i.e. @xmath119 with @xmath120 with @xmath59 for @xmath121 .",
    "we also investigate the case that only mass points at the boundary can interact with the wall for small @xmath1 but their results do not have any visible difference from the original model a. it is obvious that there is no plastic deformations for @xmath122 .    for model b , we show the results of @xmath123 modes and @xmath124 modes which clearly demonstrates the convergence of the result for the number of modes .",
    "when impact velocity @xmath125 is larger than @xmath126 with @xmath56 , the value of cor of model a is almost identical to that of model b. each line decreases smoothly as impact velocity increases .    at present , we do not know the reason why the significant difference between the two models exists at low impact velocity .",
    "it is difficult to imagine that occurrence of nonlinear deformations during the impact of model a causes the difference because the deformation is smaller when @xmath1 is smaller .",
    "second , we investigate the force acting on the center of mass of the disk caused by the interaction with the wall in model b. in the limit of @xmath36 we expect that the hertzian contact theory can be used(landau & lifshitz , 1960 ; johnson , 1985 ; gerl & zippelius , 1999 ) . the small amount of transfer from the translational motion to the internal motion is the macroscopic dissipation .",
    "thus , we can check whether the quasi - static approaches ( kuwabara & kono , 1987 ; brilliantov et al .",
    ", 1996 ; morgado & oppenheim , 1997 ) or our elastic simulation can be used in slow impact situations .",
    "if @xmath5 is given , we can calculate the elastic force by solving eq.([eq : hertz ] ) numerically .",
    "figure 3 is the comparison with our simulation in model b ( 1189 modes ) and the hertzian contact theory ( [ eq : hertz ] ) which is given by the solid lines .",
    "the result of our simulation at the impact velocity @xmath127 shows the hysteresis as suggested in the simulation at @xmath128 ( gerl & zippelius , 1999 ) .",
    "this means the compression and rebound are not symmetric .",
    "the hysteresis curve is still self - similar even at @xmath129 but the loop becomes noisy at @xmath128 .    for very low impact velocity @xmath130",
    ", the hysteresis loop almost disappears and the total force observed in our simulation is almost a linear function of @xmath5 which deviates from the one predicted by both the hertzian contact theory and the quasi - static theory ( [ 2d - quasi ] ) .",
    "in particular , the turning point which corresponds to the point of the largest @xmath131 in fig .",
    "3(b ) is apart from the hertzian curve ( the solid line ) .",
    "this deviation is in clear contrast to the quasi static theory , because the dissipative force in the theory in eqs.([oppenheim ] ) and ( [ 2d - quasi ] ) must be zero at the turning point which @xmath132 should satisfy .",
    "this tendency is invariant even for the simulation of model a , though the data becomes noisy .",
    "the linearity of the total repulsion force is not surprising , because @xmath133 in the potential term in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) can be expanded in a series of @xmath66 for very slow impact .",
    "the result may suggest that our elastic models do not recover the hertzian contact theory in the quasi - static limit . to check the tendency",
    ", we investigate whether any static state can be achieved in our models in the compression .",
    "figure 4 is the time evolution of the center of mass in the simulation of model b , where the strength of dimensionless external field is @xmath134 .",
    "we observe that an undamped harmonic oscillation of the center of mass in the simulation after the first deformation .",
    "this oscillation is stable because the energy of oscillation is not enough to overcome finite energy gap between energy levels .",
    "thus , the center of mass keeps the oscillation as the motion in the ground state .",
    "we note that fig.4 is the result of the simulation at finite temperature in which the mode transfer is enhanced .",
    "nevertheless , the center of mass keeps the harmonic oscillation .",
    "this tendency can be observed in model a , too .",
    "even when we introduce the randomness in the coupling in model a , the oscillation is undamped .",
    "thus , both of elastic models can not reach any equilibrium steady state as is assumed in the hertzian contact theory .",
    "this result indicates that the elastic models are not appropriate to describe quasi - static situations for @xmath135 .",
    "note that the introduction of nonlinear deformation may not be enough , because as we can see in fig.3 ( b ) the deformation is very small for slow impact .",
    "thus , it is difficult to imagine the impact produces nonlinear deformations . to reach an equilibrium state , thus , we need to introduce some microscopic dissipative mechanism .    however , the validity of the contact time @xmath136 in the impact evaluated as @xmath137 by the quasi - static theory ( gerl & zippelius , 1999 ) has been confirmed by the results of our simulation of model a ( fig.5 ) .",
    "thus , our elastic model can be valid in the impact with the intermediate speed .",
    "now , let us show the results of our simulation at finite @xmath116 .",
    "the thermal velocity @xmath138 causes significant differences from those at @xmath117 in both low and large impact velocities . in this sense",
    ", we have much room to study this process at finite @xmath116 systematically .    for small impact velocity ,",
    "i.e. if the effect of @xmath139 is not negligible , the fluctuation of cor at finite @xmath116 becomes large , while the average is almost independent of temperature as in figs .",
    "6 and 7 , where the results are obtained from the average of 120 independent samples . in some trials at high temperature , thus , cor becomes larger than 1 , though the average is less than 1 .",
    "of course , for such the high temperature , it is impossible to control the actual speed of impact .    for large impact velocity , @xmath140",
    ", we do not observe any definite temperature effect in model b but we find drastic decrease of cor in model a. it seems that cor can be on a universal curve when the impact velocity is scaled by the critical velocity above which the cor decreases abruptly ( fig.8 ) .",
    "the relation between the critical velocity and the initial temperature at the intermediate impact velocities is shown in fig .",
    "9 . the critical velocity seems to obey a linear function of @xmath116 , though the data is not on the function for both slow and fast impacts .",
    "in this section , let us discuss new aspects of the quasi - static theory .",
    "as in section 2 , the conventional quasi - static theories ( kuwabara & kono , 1987 ; brilliantov et al . , 1996 )",
    "consider the effect of internal friction .",
    "similarly , the langevin approach ( morgado & oppenheim , 1997 ) gives the identical result to that by conventional one . in both approaches",
    ", it is assumed that the temperature in disks is uniform . however , this assumption is not accurate .",
    "it is known that the rise of temperature is proportional to the divergence of elastic deformation ( landau & lifshitz , 1960 ) .",
    "thus , the temperature can not be uniform .    in this section , we will evaluate the dissipation rate due to the thermal diffusion and show that the contribution of this term is dominant in quasi - static situations .",
    "the result may not be complete but meaningful to indicate the importance of the thermal diffusion .    in a quasi - static collision ,",
    "the compression is proceeded in an adiabatic process .",
    "the adiabatic condition is written as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , @xmath22 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are respectively the entropy ( divided by the boltzmann constant ) , the bulk modulus , the thermal expansion rate and the temperature without any deformation ( landau , 1960 ) . from the expansion of the entropy around @xmath144 we obtain @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the bulk modulus in the adiabatic process , the heat capacity at constant pressure , the sound velocity of the longitudinal mode and the sound velocity of the tangential mode , respectively ( landau & lifshitz , 1960 ) . to obtain the final expression we use the two - dimensional relations @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "there is the relation between the stress tensor and the divergence of deformation @xmath153 as @xmath154 in the two - dimensional elastic medium ( landau & lifshitz , 1960 ) . substituting ( [ a2 ] ) into ( [ a1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath155 thus , if @xmath156 is a function of the position , the temperature field is not uniform , which is contrast to the assumption in previous quasi - static theory .",
    "it is known that the thermal diffusion causes energy dissipation .",
    "the dissipation rate is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the thermal conductivity ( landau & lifshitz , 1960 ) . the integration in ( [ a4 ] ) is performed in all region of elastic disks .",
    "thus , from ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) , the energy dissipation which is not included in previous treatments is need to be considered .",
    "now , let us evaluate the integral ( [ a4 ] ) . for this purpose , we use the exact solution of two - dimensional hertzian contact problem ( hills et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the explicit stress tensor is given by @xmath159,\\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma_{yy}&= & -p_0\\frac{\\hat y^3\\sqrt{1+s^2}}{s(s^4+\\hat y^2 ) } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are scaled by the contact radius @xmath97 which is given by @xmath162 for the contact of two identical disks .",
    "note that @xmath163 and @xmath52 are the position in the cartesian coordinate whose origin is the center of the contact area ( see fig . 10 ) .",
    "@xmath164 in ( [ a5 ] ) is given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 in ( [ a5 ] ) is @xmath167 from ( [ a5 ] ) we obtain @xmath156 @xmath168 thus , the dissipation rate ( [ a4 ] ) can be calculated in principle .",
    "note that the numerical integration of ( [ a4 ] ) is not easy , because ( i ) the explicit expression is too complicated , ( ii ) the boundary is modified by the compression , and ( iii ) the parameter @xmath169 is important and is a function of the impact velocity .",
    "thus , here , we present a rough analytical evaluation of ( [ a4 ] ) to capture the characteristics of this problem .",
    "we note that @xmath156 becomes simple in some special situations .",
    "for example , @xmath156 at @xmath41 which is on the axis of symmetry is given by ( hills et al .",
    ", 1993 ) @xmath170.\\ ] ] on the other hand , the integral representation of @xmath156 @xmath171 can be approximated by @xmath172 far from @xmath41 .",

    ", we may replace @xmath156 by @xmath176 .",
    "thus , @xmath177 in the inner region may be approximated by @xmath178 in the outer region we may replace @xmath156 by @xmath179 because such the approximation can be used in the most of regions in the quasi - static situation ( @xmath180 ) .",

    "however , we believe that the evaluation under the simplified assumption may be useful as the first step of the analysis .    in the inner region , the integrand is independent of @xmath163 and the integrated region may be approximated as a square domain @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "thus , @xmath185 in ( [ a4 ] ) can be evaluated as follows : from @xmath186 with @xmath180 , we obtain @xmath187    for the outer region , @xmath188 in ( [ a5 ] ) is @xmath189 the evaluation of the outer region is more complicated , because the domain can not be approximated by a simple rectangular domain . for the evaluation",
    ", we neglect the deformation of shape of the compressed disk .",
    "thus , the shape is approximated by a hemi - circle as in fig .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the polar coordinate @xmath190 to evaluate ( [ a16 ] ) . for a given angle @xmath118 between @xmath163 axis and @xmath191 in fig .",
    "10 @xmath192 is between @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath195 which is the cutoff angle for @xmath118 . taking into account @xmath180",
    "we can evaluate @xmath196 since these evaluations are approximate , we need to introduce the lower cutoff of @xmath195 by the consistency condition @xmath197 .",
    "thus , @xmath198 .",
    "the upper cutoff of @xmath118 is @xmath199 .",
    "thus , the integral in ( [ a16 ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath200 where we use @xmath201 with @xmath202 in the limit of @xmath203 , and @xmath204 substituting ( [ a18 ] ) into ( [ a16 ] ) we obtain @xmath205 from ( [ a15 ] ) and ( [ a21 ] ) , the total dissipation rate @xmath206 is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208    the result suggests that the dissipation rate by the thermal diffusion is dominant in quasi - static situations , because the force @xmath26 appears in ( [ a23.1 ] ) exists even in the limit of zero impact velocity , while internal frictions considered in conventional quasi - static theory disappears in the limit of zero impact velocity .",
    "this result , however , predicts a singular behavior of cor .",
    "in fact , the rough evaluation of the total energy loss @xmath209 by heat diffusion during the impact is proportional to the impact velocity @xmath1 , while the definition of cor by @xmath209 is @xmath210 .",
    "thus , cor may be singular for very small impact velocity .",
    "we need to consider another mechanism to remove such the singularity .",
    "we also need such the analysis for three dimensional situations where the stress field becomes simpler than that for two - dimensional cases ( hills et al .",
    "we investigate what happens in the disk above the critical velocity and find the existence of plastic deformation of the disk ( fig .",
    "11(a ) ) . actually , there are no energy differences between two configurations in fig .",
    "11(b ) which can occur after the strong compression during the impact but can not be released after the impact is over .",
    "it is well known that plastic deformation causes the drop of the cor ( johnson , 1985 ) .      following the description by johnson ( 1985 ) ,",
    "let us explain the dimensional analysis of the two - dimensional plastic deformation . from two - dimensional hertzian law ( [ eq : hertz ] )",
    "we evaluate @xmath211 ( johnson , 1985 ) .",
    "the work for the compression of the disk @xmath212 is @xmath213 , where @xmath65 and @xmath125 are the mass of the disk and the impact velocity , respectively .",
    "@xmath214 and @xmath215 are respectively the maximal compression and and the maximal contact length . here",
    "we neglect the logarithmic correction and unimportant numerical factors . introducing the mean contact pressure during dynamical loading @xmath216 which satisfies @xmath217",
    ", @xmath212 can be evaluated by @xmath218 . from @xmath219",
    "we can express @xmath220 .",
    "let us assume that the impact exceeds the yield pressure for the plastic deformation .",
    "in such the case , the deformation during rebound is frozen .",
    "thus , the work in a rebound is @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the maximal force during the impact . from @xmath223 and @xmath224",
    "we evaluate @xmath225 . substituting the expression of @xmath226 into the expression for @xmath212 and @xmath227",
    "we obtain the cor as    @xmath228    thus , we expect the law @xmath229 in the collision of a plastic deformed disk .",
    "the three dimensional version of evaluation which gives @xmath230 agrees well with the experiment ( johnson , 1985 ) .",
    "the actual plastic deformation is more complicated than what we modeled in this paper .",
    "for example , in the actual contact area a central region of perfect contact is surrounded by an annulus of imperfect contact . in actual situations , it is not easy to obtain a pure normal collision , because the rotation of disks is difficult to be suppressed and the wall is not perfectly flat . thus , a little deviation of the collision angle causes the tangential stress in collisions . in the existence of tangential stress , we need to consider the effect of imperfect contact or partial slip in the outer region to get finite force at the corner of contact area .",
    "we also note that the actual materials are not uniform .",
    "they contain a lot of microcracks , and amorphous structure locally .",
    "such the imperfection of the materials causes the local achievement of the yield of plastic deformation .",
    "thus , the plastic deformation also occurs localized in contrast to the macroscopic deformation in fig.11 .",
    "our finding is , however , something new , because ( i ) the decrease of cor is excited by the temperature and ( ii ) cor decreases more rapidly like @xmath231 than that for the conventional plastic deformation @xmath232 in ( [ e - plastic ] ) .",
    "the mechanism how to occur the plastic deformation is not clear at present including the linear law in fig .",
    "9 .    for future refinement of our model to describe plastic deformation",
    ", we need to introduce ( i ) the initial cracks , ( ii ) local deformation of lattices at the initial condition , ( iii ) the yield of local plastic deformation or non - hookian effects of springs , and ( iv ) porosity distribution at the initial condition except for the introduction of the heat diffusion effects as introduced in section 5 . of course",
    ", to compare the simulation with experiments , we have to simulate the model in three dimensional situations .",
    "we have numerically studied the impact of a two dimensional elastic disk with the wall with the aid of model a and model b. the result can be summarized as ( i ) the coefficient of restitution ( cor ) decreases with the impact velocity .",
    "( ii ) the result of our simulation is not consistent with the result of the two - dimensional quasi - static theory . for large impact velocity",
    ", there is hysteresis in the deformation of the center of mass . for small velocity , there remains the inelastic force even at @xmath132 .",
    "( iii ) the effect of heat diffusion may be important for the small impact velocity .",
    "( iv ) there are drastic effects of temperature in both small and large impact velocity .",
    "( v ) in particular , for large impact velocity of model a , we have found the abrupt drop of cor above the critical impact velocity by the plastic deformation . the critical velocity of the plastic deformation seems to obey a simple linear function of temperature .",
    "we believe that this preliminary report is meaningful to recognize that physicists have poor understanding of such the fundamental process of elementary mechanics .",
    "we hope that this paper will invite a lot of interest in the impact from various view points .",
    "we , at least , have a plan to study three dimensional impacts to clarify the relation among the microscopic simulation , experiments and the quasi - static elastic theory .",
    "in this appendix let us introduce the derivation of quasi - static theory by morgado and oppenheim ( 1997 ) .",
    "the characteristics of their derivation is to introduce thermal deformation explicitly to assist the elastic deformation .",
    "although they do not mention what the thermal deformation is , it is the complex combination of inelastic scattering of phonons , electrons , sound radiation into the air and any other mechanism which can not be regarded as the elastic deformation . in this appendix",
    "we introduce a simplified version of the derivation of langevin equation instead of using the original argument ( morgado @xmath233 oppenheim , 1997 ) .",
    "note that the argument in this appendix is restricted to one in three dimensional systems .",
    "thus , the position @xmath234 of @xmath9-th .",
    "atom can be written as @xmath235 , where @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 are respectively the equilibrium position of the atom @xmath9 , the elastic deformation and the thermal deformation . here",
    "the terminology of thermal deformation means that the deformation can not be controlled or the origin has not been specified from macroscopic point of view .",
    "such the thermal deformations may be regarded as a not important variables which can be treated as random variables .",
    "let us introduce @xmath239",
    ". in the local rule in this appendix , suffices @xmath240 represent atoms , and the greek suffices such as @xmath241 are components .",
    "in addition , we adopt einstein s rule for suffices where the duplicated suffices mean the summation as @xmath242 . for small deformation , @xmath243 can be written as @xmath244    the potential among atoms can be approximated by a harmonic one near its equilibrium position .",
    "thus , the harmonic potential for isotropic systems is given by @xmath245 note that the original paper(morgado & oppenheim , 1997 ) does not assume isotropic form of @xmath246 .",
    "then @xmath246 is replaced by a second order tensor . substituting ( [ ii-3 - 1 ] ) into ( [ ii-3 - 2 ] ) , eq.([ii-3 - 2 ] )",
    "becomes the combination of three terms : @xmath247 the first term of the right hand side of ( [ ii-3 - 3 ] ) is the elastic energy for the deformation which can be written as @xmath248 where @xmath249 note that in the original paper ( morgado & oppenheim , 1997 ) , the coefficient of @xmath250 becomes a fourth - order tensor .",
    "@xmath251 also includes a constant which is represented by a second - order tensor .    here ,",
    "@xmath252 and @xmath21 are lam s elastic coefficients .",
    "the second term of right hand side of ( [ ii-3 - 3 ] ) is given by @xmath253 which expresses the coupling between the elastic deformation and the thermal deformation .",
    "the third term of ( [ ii-3 - 3 ] ) , @xmath254 is the energy of the thermal deformation .",
    "the contribution of this term is in general smaller than other terms .",
    "the collision of two elastic bodies consists of materials 1 and 2 .",
    "the energy is the simple summation of the contribution of two materials .",
    "let the center of mass of i - th particle @xmath255 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the interaction during collision appears if @xmath256 .",
    "morgado and oppenheim ( 1997 ) assume that the slow mode , the motion of the center of mass , can be written by the solution of the langevin equation . in the langevin equation ,",
    "the elastic force is regarded as a systematic force , while the force @xmath257 plays a role of the fluctuating force . as in the general framework of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath258 in the langevin equation is determined by the time correlation function of the fluctuating force as @xmath259 here @xmath260 is retarded one of @xmath261 by time @xmath136 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath262 where @xmath263 and the upper suffix @xmath264 represents the particles 1,2 . here , @xmath238 can be regarded as the thermal fluctuation as @xmath265 thus , we obtain @xmath266    let us recall that kramer s equation for many - body systems @xmath267 p(x_t , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j(\\ne k)=1}^2\\zeta_{12}\\hat{\\bf r}_{jk}\\hat{\\bf r}_{jk } : \\nabla_{{\\bf p}_{kj } }   % \\nonumber \\\\ % & & \\times ( \\beta\\frac{{\\bf p}_{kj}}{m}+\\nabla_{{\\bf p}_{kj } } ) \\right ] p(x_t , t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is equivalent to the langevin equation , where @xmath268 , @xmath269 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 .",
    "@xmath273 is the unit vector from the center of @xmath274 th .",
    "particle to the center of @xmath275-th .",
    "particle . here",
    "we introduce the average @xmath276 as @xmath277 for any variable @xmath278 .",
    "note that we have the relation @xmath279 introducing the relative coordinate @xmath280 approximating that the potential @xmath246 is approximated by @xmath281 we obtain @xmath282 note the contribution of the linear momentum disappears from the integral by parts .",
    "the elastic force @xmath283 is nothing but the hertzian contact force , and @xmath284 .",
    "thus , the time evolution of the macroscopic deformation @xmath5 ( @xmath5 satisfies @xmath285 . )",
    "is given by @xmath286 therefore , to determine the dissipation is reduced to determination of the friction constant @xmath287 .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to obtain the exact form of @xmath287 , because @xmath288 is determined from the complicated relations between the elastic deformation and the thermal deformation .",
    "however , from the consideration of power counting of @xmath5 it is not difficult to deduce how @xmath287 depends on @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show the scaling @xmath289 in the hertzian contact theory .",
    "similarly we have @xmath290 and @xmath291 . from the comparison between the elastic energy ( [ elastic ] ) and @xmath287 in ( [ ii-3 - 7 ] ) , it is easy to understand that the key point is how @xmath292 and @xmath293 are scaled by @xmath143 . from the discussion here",
    "the elastic energy is scaled as @xmath294 , and thus @xmath287 is scaled as @xmath295 .",
    "thus , we finally obtain @xmath296 and @xmath297 where @xmath298 and @xmath299 can not be determined from this argument",

    "1996 ) .",

    "both of derivation assumed that the temperature field is uniform , but this assumption is not correct in general . as discussed in the text , the rise of temperature",
