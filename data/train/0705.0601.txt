    "the two - dimensional axial next - nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model ( @xmath4 ) is a square lattice ising model with nearest neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along both the axial directions and second neighbor anti - ferromagnetic interaction along one axial direction .",

    "the second - neighbor interaction introduces a frustration .",
    "this is one of the simplest frustrated classical ising model with a tunable frustration and has been studied over a long time ( @xcite for review ) .",
    "the most widely studied aspect of this model is the phase diagram in the @xmath11 phase space , where @xmath0 stands for temperature .",
    "it is easy to prove analytically that @xcite at zero temperature , the system is in a ferromagnetic state for @xmath12 , and in antiphase ( @xmath13 along @xmath6 direction and all like spins along @xmath7 direction ) for @xmath14 with a `` multiphase '' state at @xmath15 .",
    "( the multiphase state comprises of all possible configurations that have no domain of length 1 along the @xmath6 direction . )    from monte carlo simulations and approximate analytic calculations , some early studies had proposed a phase diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ani ] ) consisting of a ferromagnetic phase ( for @xmath12 ) and antiphase ( for @xmath14 ) at low temperature along with a paramagnetic phase at high temperature ( for all @xmath1 values ) .",
    "the crucial point is , between the ordered and the disordered phases for @xmath14 , there may be a so - called `` floating '' phase characterized by ( i ) a spin - spin correlation that decays algebraically with distance and ( ii ) an incommensurate , continuously varying modulation .",
    "an approximate analytic treatment by villain and bak @xcite predicted that ( for @xmath14 ) as temperature increases from zero , there is a second order pokrovsky - talapov type commensurate - incommensurate phase transition from antiphase to the floating phase followed by a kosterlitz - thouless transition from the floating to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this leads to a phase diagram shown schematically in fig . 1 .",
    "several computational studies ( see @xcite ) also confirmed such a phase diagram .",
    "later , shirahata and nakamura @xcite have measured the dynamical exponent by studying the non - equilibrium relaxation of order parameter at @xmath16 0.6 and 0.8 and concluded that the floating phase exists , if at all , over a narrow temperature range only .",
    "the central problem in this study is that the identification of order parameter is ambiguous for @xmath3 , in the sense that it is difficult to identify a physical observable that relaxes algebraically at the critical temperature .",
    "one may note that the antiphase magnetization @xmath17 does not satisfy this criterion @xcite .",
    "( here , @xmath18 is the spin distribution for perfect aniphase distribution . ) recently , a density matrix renormalization group analysis @xcite has also excluded the presence of any incommensurate phase over an extended region .",
    "the 2d annni model is related to the transverse annni chain by suzuki - trotter transformation @xcite .",
    "this quantum ising model has also been studied widely .",
    "numerical and approximate analytic studies @xcite had predicted that the floating phase exists in the transverse annni chain over a region , as shown in fig .",
    "however , recently we have shown @xcite that for this model , the floating phase exists over a wide region extending from @xmath12 to @xmath14 .",
    "there is thus a controversy about the existence of algebraically decaying phase in 2d annni model .    in this article",
    ", we shall present monte carlo simulation of 2d annni model with a view to locating the floating phase , if any . for @xmath2 , one can easily identify the magnetization as the order parameter and for this case we have therefore , measured    1 .   internal energy 2 .",
    "magnetization .    for @xmath3 ,",
    "the ordered phase is `` antiphase '' and it is difficult to identify the order parameter unambiguously . in this case , we have measured    1 .   internal energy , 2 .",
    "layer magnetization ( magnetization perpendicular to the direction of frustration ) 3 .",
    "length of domain walls running along the direction of frustration 4 .",
    "number of domain - intercepts that are of length 2 over a straight line along the direction of frustration 5 .",
    "number of dislocations measured as the number of domain walls that do not touch the upper and/or lower boundary .",
    "we shall discuss later ( sec .",
    "iii ) the significance of these quantities in the context of our work .    from the measurement of a suitable physical quantity @xmath19 at a time @xmath20 , the critical point ( or , for that matter , the critical region ) could be identified from the general principle that at the critical point the quantity @xmath21 is expected to vanish algebraically as a function of time @xmath20 . while this characteristic is handy for the case @xmath22 , it is not usable when @xmath23 , as very large time simulation is required to measure the quantity @xmath24 itself . in such cases ,",
    "we have utilized two essential features of critical phenomena : ( i ) for a finite lattice , the correlation time will diverge as @xcite @xmath25 hence , the quantity @xmath19 will depend strongly on the system size only at the critical temperature @xmath26 even at finite values of @xmath20 .",
    "( ii ) the equilibrium value @xmath24 will undergo a sudden change , which is detectable even for small size and becomes more and more drastic as the system size increases .    as mentioned above , the results from non - equilibrium relaxation study @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group analysis @xcite contradicts the previous studies @xcite as regards the extent of the floating phase .",
    "this paper confirms the conclusion of the former two studies by monte carlo simulation .",
    "one should note that all these studies agree at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "we measure some observables that play a crucial role in the underlying physics and that have not been analyzed till now .    in sections",
    "ii and iii we shall present the simulation studies for @xmath27 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "all the simulation studies were performed with sequential metropolis algorithm using periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions and the results were averaged over 10 to 50 realizations . in section iv we shall study the correspondence between the 2d annni model and the transverse annni chain and in section v present conclusions .",
    "our final conclusion is that the divergent correlation time exists only along a line .",
    "the phase diagram obtained is presented in fig .",

    "is measured in unit of @xmath28 , the critical temperature for nearest - neighbor interaction ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this diagram is in qualitative agreement with that obtained by shirahata and nakamura @xcite and derian , gendiar and nishino @xcite .",
    "the small difference between our results and those obtained by these authors seems to be due to the small ( @xmath30 ) size of our simulation , compared to that of shirahata and nakamura ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "before we consider the measurements on the 2d annni model itself , let us break off for a discussion on critical behavior of energy relaxation in general .",
    "internal energy @xmath32 is always unambiguously defined , in contrast to the order parameter , which for some phase transitions ( like our system for @xmath14 ) may not be easy to identify and measure . however , since @xmath33 , it is difficult to study the time variation of the quantity @xmath34 , as mentioned above . the relaxation of energy has also been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we shall now consider the case of @xmath35 ( only nearest - neighbor interaction ) , and obtain the exponent , following standard scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "starting from the standard diffusion equation for the ( non - conserved ) order parameter @xmath36 @xmath37 one obtains @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the appropriate free energy and @xmath40 is a parameter of the model . the identity @xmath41 , where @xmath32 is the total internal energy then gives , = - ( 1 + ) ( ) ^2 . the scaling relation for the order parameter",
    "may be written as @xcite , ( t , , l , _ 0 ) = b^-/ ( b^-zt , b^1/ , b^-1l ) where @xmath42 ( @xmath0 being the temperature measured in units of @xmath43 ) , l is the linear dimension of the system , @xmath44 is the scaling factor , and @xmath45 is the initial value of the order parameter .",
    "also , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the static critical exponents , and @xmath48 is the dynamic critical exponent . choosing @xmath49 and suppressing the unimportant arguments @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath45",
    ", we obtain , ( t , ) = t^-/z where @xmath52 is the derivative of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath53 . substituting this form in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have , for large time , e ~t^- where @xmath54 is the energy difference @xmath34 and @xmath55 .",
    "our simulations confirm this value of sigma ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa00.1000 ] ) .    in the case of annni model ( @xmath1 non - zero but @xmath56 )",
    "we study the energy relaxation starting from ferromagnetic state .",
    "our results for @xmath57 is as follows .",
    "the @xmath58 vs @xmath20 curve for an @xmath59 lattice is the same for @xmath60 700 , 1000 and 1200 at a temperature @xmath610.40 ( in units of @xmath43 ) .",
    "this happens also for @xmath610.41 but not for @xmath610.404 , where the relaxation behavior depends on @xmath50 to the largest extent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxk45 ] ) . at @xmath60 700",
    ", we could evaluate @xmath62 and found that @xmath63 vs @xmath20 plot shows an algebraic decay around @xmath0=0.40 but the algebraic region is most extended for @xmath61 0.404 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa45.700 ] ) .",
    "it is hence concluded that at @xmath64 , the critical point is @xmath65 .",
    "we could not however evaluate @xmath62 for @xmath66 or 1200 as they involve too much computational time .",
    "moreover , even at @xmath67 , there is some anomaly in the sense that the decay of @xmath58 at @xmath68 is _ faster _ ( rather than slower ) than that for @xmath69 and 1000 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxk45 ] ) .",
    "a simulation over a longer time scale might resolve the anomaly .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath64 , @xmath67 , the exponent @xmath70 has a value @xmath71 .",
    "although it is a computationally intensive job to determine @xmath70 accurately , we attempted to study the apparent variation of @xmath70 with @xmath1 and found that it does not change much till @xmath72 and afterwards decrease markedly .      for @xmath12",
    ", the order parameter is magnetisation @xmath73 , whose equilibrium value is zero at the critical point .",
    "hence , an easy method of locating the critical point is to investigate where the magnetisation relaxes algebraically .",
    "it is well - known ( eq.(4 ) ) that at @xmath26 the magnetisation decays as m ~t^-^ where @xmath74 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the value of @xmath75 is 0.05734 .    at @xmath64 the magnetization",
    "is found to relax algebraically only around @xmath76 , which therefore is the critical temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxmag2.k45 ] ) . that the critical temperature at @xmath64 lies between 0.40 and 0.41",
    "is also verified by the fact that there is a sudden change in the equilibrium value of magnetization as temperature increases from 0.40 to 0.41 , and that this change becomes more and more sudden as the lattice size increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mag2.k45 ] ) .",
    "the exponent for magnetization decay turns out to be @xmath77 at @xmath64 , @xmath67 . as for the case of energy relaxation , it is a computationally intensive job to determine @xmath75 accurately .",
    "approximate measurements indicate that just like @xmath70 , the exponent @xmath75 also remains more or less the same up to @xmath72 and starts decreasing markedly at higher @xmath1 .",
    "further investigations on the apparent variation of @xmath70 and @xmath75 is in progress .",
    "in this case , it is difficult to identify the order parameter , as mentioned above .",
    "it can be easily proved @xcite that , at low temperature the system is in a perfectly ordered state with like spins along the y axis and + +  -  - pattern repeated along the x direction .",
    "the domain walls thus run exactly parallel to the y axis . moving along the x ( y ) axis",
    ", one finds domains of length 2 ( @xmath50 ) , for an @xmath59 system . as one increases the temperature , after some temperature @xmath26 ( called the lower critical temperature )",
    ", domains of length larger than 2 appear along the x direction .",
    "the domain walls now run not always parallel to the y axis .",
    "they start from the lower boundary and terminate at the upper , but they often take small steps parallel to the x axis . along the y axis",
    "the domains are now sometimes less than @xmath50 in length .",
    "villain and bak @xcite pointed out that the number of domains that do not touch _ both _ boundaries is crucial and represents some sort of `` dislocation '' .",
    "this number is almost zero immediately above @xmath26 but suddenly increases at some temperature @xmath78 . while @xmath26 marks a second order commensurate - incommensurate ( pokrovsky - talapov type ) transition , @xmath78 marks a kosterlitz - thouless type transition . for @xmath79 domains of small size",
    "appear in x and y direction and the system is in a paramagnetic state . for @xmath80 , villain and",
    "bak claimed that , the wavelength of modulation changes continuously with temperature and the correlation length is infinity , leading to a spin - spin correlation that decays algebraically with distance .",
    "to study the two transitions , one at @xmath81 and the other at @xmath82 , we measure several quantities always starting the simulation with antiphase as the initial configuration .",
    "\\(1 ) internal energy is studied in the same way as done for @xmath12 .",
    "\\(2 ) layer magnetization is defined ( following @xcite ) as the magnetization of a chain along the y axis averaged over all such chains : m_l = ^l_x=1 m_x where , @xmath83 obviously , this quantity should be 1 for @xmath84 and zero above @xmath78 . hence , the size dependence of the relaxation of @xmath85 and the algebraic nature of relaxation of @xmath85 would indicate a diverging correlation length .",
    "shirahata and nakamura @xcite have studied this quantity to identify the upper transition temperature @xmath78 at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "\\(3 ) the sum of length of the segments of domain walls that are parallel to the x axis , divided by the system size gives a quantity ( say , @xmath88 ) which is strictly zero in the perfect antiphase , but increases suddenly to some non - zero value at @xmath26 .",
    "its measurement leads to an estimate of @xmath26 .",
    "\\(4 ) moving in the x - direction , one may note the lengths of domain intercepts encountered , and compute the ratio @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of domains of length 2 and @xmath91 is the total number of domains .",
    "this ratio is 1 for @xmath84 and decreases for higher @xmath0 .",
    "we note the region over which the relaxation of @xmath92 depends on size or is algebraic in nature .",
    "\\(5 ) the spin domains are identified and the fraction ( @xmath93 ) of domains that do not touch the upper and/or lower boundary is counted .",
    "( those which miss any one boundary is counted with weightage 1 and those which miss both the boundaries are given weightage 2 . )",
    "this fraction measures the number of `` dislocations '' that drives the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition at @xmath78 .",
    "we do not study the relaxation of this quantity for computational limitations , but obtain from simulation the equilibrium value away from @xmath26 .",
    "such measurement should lead to an estimation of the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath78 , if any .",
    "the study of all these quantities leads us to the conclusion that the floating phase , i.e. the region between @xmath26 and @xmath78 extends , if at all , over a temperature range less than 0.02 .",
    "thus , the region of diverging correlation length exists _ only along a line _ , up to the accuracy of this study .",
    "our study was performed at @xmath94 0.55 , 0.60 , 1.0 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is presented in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : realphase ] ) .",
    "however , it is interesting to observe that while the width of the critical region is 0.02 for @xmath14 , it is much less , about 0.001 , for @xmath12 .",
    "the study of energy relaxation for @xmath14 follows closely the procedure for @xmath12 , with the only difference that the initial configuration is now the antiphase . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the energy relaxation depends on size predominantly at @xmath61 0.43 and 0.44 ( fig .",

    "therefore , at @xmath86 we identify @xmath26 as @xmath96 .",
    "the curves for @xmath97 are qualitatively similar to that for @xmath86 , and @xmath26 could be identified as @xmath98 .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the results could be that the floating phase would exist , if at all , between @xmath610.43 to 0.44 ( 0.37 to 0.38 ) at @xmath16 0.60 ( 0.55 ) . that the energy does not show any critical behavior over an extended range of temperature , seems to indicate that the floating phase does not exist over an extended region .",
    "we mention that we could not perform the study of energy relaxation at @xmath99 , since for this case a reliable data needs averaging over too many configurations .",
    "the exponent for energy relaxation @xmath75 ( see eq.(5 ) ) is found to be @xmath100 for @xmath94 0.55 and 0.60 . in contrast to the findings for @xmath12 , we observe no marked variation of @xmath75 with @xmath1 .",

    "the critical temperature for @xmath97 and 1.00 is obtained as @xmath98 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "we could not study the relaxation of this quantity since averaging over too many realisations is necessary for a reasonably smooth curve .",
    "rather , we could measure the equilibrium value at temperatures where the relaxation was not prohibitively slow .",
    "it is found that for @xmath109 , the critical temperature lies between 0.42 and 0.45 , since a sudden change is observed in the equilibrium value of @xmath93 in this temperature range and that this change becomes more and more sudden as the lattice size increases ( fig .",

    "<S> the low temperature phase is antiphase and we study energy , layer magnetization , length of domain walls running along the direction of frustration , number of domain - intercepts that are of length 2 along the direction of frustration , and the number of domain walls that do not touch the upper and/or lower boundary . in agreement with some previous studies , </S>",
