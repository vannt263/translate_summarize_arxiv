    "in a @xmath6cdm universe , galaxies , on average , move from areas of lower density to areas of higher density , merging and combining to form larger and larger systems like the massive galaxy clusters we see in the local universe .",
    "galaxy evolution , therefore , can not be understood without considering the influence of environment on galaxy properties .",
    "the importance of environment on galaxy evolution is demonstrated by the differences between galaxies in clusters and those in the field .",
    "for example , the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters has been decreasing since z @xmath7 1 , and local clusters are dominated by red galaxies ( butcher & oemler 1978 ; kennicutt 1983 ; hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 ; andreon et al .",

    "dressler ( 1980 ) found a dramatic increase in the proportion of early - type galaxies with local density inside rich clusters , i.e. , the morphology - density relation .",
    "this relation has also been shown to extend down to the group environment ( postman & geller 1984 ) .",
    "most of these cluster early - type galaxies have not had appreciable star formation in gigayears , though as we move outward from the centers of the clusters , we see more late - type galaxies overall and more early - type galaxies that have had more recent star formation ( balogh et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; bai et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "environment is expected to influence the rates of both gas exhaustion and interactions .",
    "the drop in star - forming activity in dense environments might be due to interactions with the inter - galactic gas , such as through ram - pressure stripping of cold gas in galaxies ( gunn & gott 1972 ; larson et al .",
    "1980 ; kinney et al . 2004 ) or stripping of the hot gas through strangulation ( balogh et al .",
    "2000 ; kawata & mulchaey 2008 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "alternatively , the lower fraction of star forming galaxies might arise through galaxy - galaxy interactions , either major mergers or harassment ( frequent high - speed encounters of galaxies that do not lead to mergers ) , both of which would accelerate the star formation and lead to early exhaustion of the interstellar material .",
    "tides raised by the overall gravitational potential of dense clusters may also play a role ( henriksen & byrd 1996 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the morphological transformation into early - type galaxies may occur first , suppressing star formation by stabilizing the gas against fragmentation ( martig et al .",
    "2009 ) , although other recent studies question this claim @xcite .",
    "explaining the behavior of galaxies in different environments in terms of consistent theories for the growth of galaxies in the early universe has proven challenging ( bower et al .",
    "2006 ; kaviraj et al .",
    "therefore , an intense observational approach is needed to help develop an understanding of the relation between environment and galaxy evolution .",
    "it should be possible to disentangle environmental influences by comparing galaxy behavior in different environments , though just as the mechanisms for galaxy transformation are not fully understood , the environments where these processes operate also need to be explored and defined . additionally , most of the previous work regarding star formation with respect to environment focused on rich clusters ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "2009 ; bai et al .",
    "2009 ; haines et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) ; relatively few studies have focused on groups ( e.g. zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 , 2000 ; balogh et al . 2004 ; johnson et al . 2007 ; marcillac et al . 2008 ; bai et al . 2010 ) .",
    "simard et al . ( 2009 ) argue that cluster - centric processes are not the dominant factor in galaxy morphological transformation .",
    "the majority of galaxies live in the less - dense group environment ( geller & huchra 1983 ; eke et al 2004 ) , and because clusters probably form from coalescing groups and field galaxies , much of the evolution apparent in cluster galaxies may have occurred in groups prior to their assimilation into clusters .",
    "zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) found that the proportion of early - type galaxies in groups ranged from that typical of the field ( @xmath725% ) to that found in dense clusters ( @xmath755% ) , suggesting that much of the morphological transformation of galaxies from field to cluster properties occurs in groups .",
    "@xcite show that an increase in the proportion of s0 galaxies with decreasing redshift occurs in moderate - mass groups / poor clusters ( @xmath8 km s@xmath4 ) , and @xcite find that for groups at intermediate redshifts , the fraction of s0s is as high as in clusters , even at fixed luminosities . additionally , because most galaxies reside in groups  and , therefore , galaxies spend most of their time in groups  uncovering the effects of these lower - density environments can help us understand the evolutionary path of the global galaxy population over cosmic time @xcite .    if morphological transformations frequently occur at intermediate densities , is this also the location where star formation is cutoff ?",
    "previous studies of star formation in groups have mostly focused on optical indicators such as h@xmath9 or [ oii]@xmath103727 emission lines or ultraviolet continuum .",
    "these measures can extend to low levels of star formation , and they indicate a significantly lower level of activity in groups and clusters than in the field ( wilman et al . 2005a ; gerke et al .",
    "2007 ; balogh et al . 2009",
    "; iovino et al .",
    "2010 ; peng et al .",
    "such first - order comparisons are usually made under the assumption that the extinction is similar in groups and clusters ( and that star formation is not deeply obscured ) .",
    "however , corrections are required to convert these optical indicators to accurate star formation rates ( sfrs ) . at z @xmath3 0.3",
    ", h@xmath9 moves out of the range of optical spectroscopy and sfr estimates rely on [ oii ] , where the extinction is large and uncertain .",
    "the [ oii]@xmath11 line has additional problems of being sensitive to dust reddening and metallicity , thus being relatively weak in high - mass systems , although empirical corrections have been suggested to correct for this and other effects ( moustakas et al .",
    "2006 ; gilbank et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) is advantageous for probing high levels of star formation .",

    "this paper is a step toward understanding the influence of the group environment on star formation and resolving some of the apparent discrepancies in previous studies of the same topic .",
    "some of these discrepancies , especially in cluster studies , may arise from `` field '' samples contaminated by groups . to compare groups with actual field galaxies , we need a clean field sample with as many galaxies as possible . here",

    "any galaxies that fall in a bin with five or more galaxies at any point in the running average were removed from the field sample as possible group contaminants .",
    "this method will obviously remove some true field galaxies , as it does not account for the spatial positions of the possible group galaxies ; however , this is a quick , simple method for removing galaxies that are likely to live in groups .",
    "we removed a total of 78 galaxies  or @xmath725%of our original field sample .",
    "these observations of groups and the `` cleaned '' field sample ( referred to simply as the `` field '' from this point on ) result in 24  measurements or upper limits for 232 group galaxies and 236 field galaxies from @xmath23 , of which 79 group galaxies and 65 field galaxies are detected .",

    "we use this lower value as our detection limit for the rest of the paper . at a typical redshift for our groups ( z @xmath7 0.43 )",
    ", l@xmath32 corresponds to sfr @xmath7 10 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the typical optical surface density of the geec groups is @xmath73 galaxies mpc@xmath33 for galaxies with m@xmath34 @xmath26 -20 , though it ranges from @xmath71 to @xmath76.5 .",
    "cluster surface densities can range from these values in the outskirts to as high as several hundred galaxies mpc@xmath33 in the dense cores @xcite .",
    "we cross - correlated the sources detected at 24  ( almost 2000 objects over all fields ) with the geec spectroscopic catalog to within 3 arcsec ; if multiple optical sources were located within 3 arcsec of a 24  source , the nearest optical source was used ( only 20 instances of such multiple matches using the entire 24  and cnoc2 catalogs were recorded ) .",
    "any geec galaxy not matching this criterion was given a 3@xmath29 upper limit . to estimate the 1@xmath29 errors ( and 3@xmath29 upper limits for non - detected sources ) in the 24  flux densities , we put down apertures in blank areas of the fields and took the standard deviation of the nearest 20 background apertures to a given source .",
    "because of the depth of our observations and the size of the mips 24  psf , it is necessary to know the fraction of false detections  in other words , the fraction of 24  sources incorrectly attributed to an optical source in our catalog .",
    "we therefore placed a random number of fake sources ( up to 300 sources per pointing , which at z = 0.55 equates a surface density of 4 mpc@xmath33 ) on each image and matched the 24  detections to both the fake source catalog and our geec spectroscopic catalog .",
    "we use three different match radii4 , 3 , and 2.5 arcsec  and found the mean fraction of false detections to be 3.1% , 1.8% , and 1.3% , respectively , for each match radius . as expected ,",
    "the number of false detections per unit area is relatively constant and does not change significantly for each match radius .",
    "we could use any of the listed match radii and not change the number of false matches substantially ( i.e. from @xmath73 to @xmath77 for the group and field samples individually , out of @xmath7230 galaxies in each environment , and from @xmath72 to @xmath75 for the cleaned field ) .",
    "however , if we use too small a match radius ( @xmath0 2.5 arcsec ) , we risk eliminating real matches . at our typical detection levels of @xmath745@xmath29 , the rms positional errors at 24  are @xmath71.5 arcsec .",
    "additionally , from examination of our hst acs images ( see the appendix for more information ) , we discovered that using a matching radius of 4 arcsec could introduce more false detections than anticipated due to the crowded nature of our group - dominated fields .",
    "for these reasons , we used the 3 arcsec matching radius .",
    "a 3 arcsec matching radius results in @xmath74.2 incorrectly matched galaxies for the groups and @xmath72.7 for the cleaned field for all galaxies .",
    "if we assume that all of the mis - matched galaxies are detected at 24 , we would have upper limits that @xmath0 5.6% and @xmath0 6.5% of detected group and field galaxies , respectively , are incorrectly matched .",
    "we also need to keep in mind that we are comparing group and field galaxies en masse , not individually .",
    "false detections will affect the groups and field each the same way , and so will not bias our results provided that the number of false detections remains low , which we have already shown to be the case .",
    "as such , the matching technique ( and match length of 3 arcsec ) is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "extreme environments , such as the interior regions of clusters , clearly quench star formation in galaxies and reduce their ir outputs ( e.g. , bai et al . 2009 ) . based on the ages of their dominant stellar populations and distributions of morphologies , galaxies in rich groups and clusters",
    "must have a similar evolution , at least at low redshift @xcite .",
    "this suggests that galaxy transformation occurs in groups as well as in clusters . to test for such behavior",
    ", we compare the fractional ir lf in groups with that of field galaxies at intermediate redshifts .      to compare the ir output and sfr of group and field galaxies , we estimated the sfr and total ir luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) from the 24  flux densities using the method described by @xcite , who use _ spitzer _ data to create a group of luminous star - forming galaxy templates more complete in the near- and mid - ir than previous templates .",
    "our method for determining sfr and l@xmath1 is only accurate for purely star - forming galaxies",
    ". obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can also emit a significant fraction of their light in the mid - ir . to identify possible agn contaminants in our sample , we compared our 24-detected galaxies with _ chandra _ detections .",
    "four of the galaxies in the cnoc2 sample were identified as agn with clear x - ray detections , though all four were field galaxies outside of our redshift range ( i.e. not in our geec sample ) . however , some agn may be so buried that we are not able to detect them at our current x - ray detection threshold . more importantly , slightly less than half of the groups targeted by mips have x - ray coverage ,",
    "so there may still be some agn contaminating our sample .",
    "given the few agn detected with the existing data and in previous studies of agn activity in groups ( dwarakanath & nath 2006 ; silverman et al .",
    "2009 ) , we expect this number to be small . to correct for the different redshifts of our group and field galaxies , we used the derived luminosity evolution of ir galaxies from @xcite , who show that ir galaxies as a whole evolve in luminosity as ( 1+z)@xmath35 from z @xmath7 0 to z @xmath7 1.2 .",
    "we evolved our group and field galaxy ir luminosities to a fiducial redshift ( z @xmath36 ) to remove redshift bias in our sample .",
    "this ir luminosity evolution is for all ir galaxies regardless of environment ; however , the @xcite sample ( as for most field samples ) is expected to be @xmath750% groups , @xmath750% true field galaxies , making this model reasonable for our purposes .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the lack of significant differences in the field and group fractional luminosity functions ( flfs ) as discussed below .        in figure",
    "[ fig : ltirz ] we present l@xmath1 ( left axis ) and sfr ( right axis ) with respect to redshift for all galaxies in the cnoc2 survey for which we have mips 24  detections .",

    "the average detection limit for all of our 24  fields is shown by the solid black curve ; the redshift limits of our geec group and field sample are denoted by dashed lines ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the group and field ir - active populations do not appear significantly different .",
    "figure [ fig : lf_ltir ] gives us a clearer picture of the group and field populations in terms of l@xmath1 . we plot histograms of the normalized distributions of l@xmath1 ( which we will refer to as flfs from here on ) for the group and field galaxies ( red filled circles and blue open circles , respectively ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates our 24  detection limit for all field galaxies , while the dotted line is the detection limit for all group galaxies .",
    "the fractions in each bin ( y - axis values ) are normalized by the number of 24-detected galaxies in each environment and corrected for spectroscopic incompleteness as a function of magnitude .",
    "weights were computed using the method outlined in appendix a of wilman et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , except in this case we do not correct for any radial dependent selection , which tends to overweight galaxies on the outskirts of groups .",
    "we have also corrected for completeness with respect to the 24  data .",
    "we calculated the 24  incompleteness by estimating the sfr corresponding to the detection limits for all galaxies in each image .",
    "we then found the fraction of group and field galaxies ( separately ) with sfr detection limits below a given sfr ; the inverse of this fraction in each bin corresponds to our 24  completeness weighting .",
    "the completeness corrections for the points shown above both of these limits are small : factors of @xmath0 1.7 for both the group and field galaxies .",
    "the group and field galaxy flfs are identical within the error bars up to log(l@xmath1 ( l@xmath2 ) ) @xmath7 12 .",
    "the last two bins contain few galaxies , so we can not compare the bright end with much certainty . the measurements slightly below our detection limit should not be significantly biased given the care to avoid bias in the sample selection @xcite and that the vast majority of the group and field galaxies have detection limits below the indicated limit ; therefore , we can say that these data also agree within the error bars with some certainty .",
    "overall , the flfs suggest that there is little difference between the groups and the field ( with respect to l@xmath1 ) .",
    "given that there are similar numbers of spectroscopically - identified galaxies in the groups and field in this redshift range , even the overall normalization will be the same .",

    "the k - s test indicated a @xmath799% probability that the two distributions can come from the same parent sample .",
    "due to the coupling between l@xmath1 and sfr through l(24 ) @xcite , the results are the same if we plot sfr instead of l@xmath1 .    to better quantify the two lfs themselves , we fit both with a schechter function , minimizing @xmath37@xmath38 .",

    "figures [ fig : ltirz ] and [ fig : lf_ltir ] , and our statistical analysis of the results , suggest that the group environment does not substantially quench or enhance star formation at intermediate redshifts for the ir luminosities we are studying .",
    "could the environmental effects be more prominent in the larger groups ? to test this possibility , we plot the number of group members brighter than m@xmath34 @xmath27 -20 versus l@xmath1 ( luminosity - evolved to z @xmath7 0.5 ) in figure [ fig : nltir ] .",

    "we see no trend in 24-detected galaxies with respect to group size , and the differences between the mean ir luminosity values is not significant . therefore",
    ", within the l@xmath1 limit of our sample , group size does not strongly affect the ir luminosity of the member galaxies .",
    "this is interesting given that interactions are thought to be a major source of star - formation quenching in groups ( given that higher densities are needed for other quenching mechanisms like ram - pressure stripping and strangulation ) , and the number of galaxies that have experienced past interactions and mergers should be larger in more massive groups , which have more members .",

    "this seems to be true with local clusters , as well ( bai et al .",

    "while the total ir luminosities and sfrs of the group galaxies do not appear different from the field , there could be trends with stellar mass .",
    "the most massive galaxies in dense regions of the local universe , such as cluster cores , are old ellipticals , whereas the most massive field galaxies are blue spirals . what about groups at intermediate redshifts ?",
    "the stellar masses used here are presented in @xcite , but briefly , we use spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of all available photometry .",
    "the details of the photometry were presented in balogh et al .",

    "the star formation history is modeled as an exponentially declining base rate with bursts of star formation randomly distributed in time , which vary in duration and relative strength .",
    "we produce model magnitudes by convolving these model seds with the observed photometric bandpasses at nine redshifts between 0.25 and 0.6 .",
    "finally , we minimize the @xmath42 while summing over all the models and taking account of the observed uncertainty on each point . by comparing to other estimates of stellar mass we estimate that 1@xmath29 uncertainties are on the order of 0.15 dex .",

    "this may be another indication of a stronger mass  sfr relation in the field than in the groups , though the differences between the group and field galaxies here are of low significance .",
    "we performed a monte carlo analysis of the data in the top plot of figure [ fig : morph_hist ] to estimate whether the overall fraction of low - activity galaxies , at constant stellar mass , is significantly higher for group galaxies .",

    "that is , this reinforces our conclusion that the group environment does not suppress or enhance star formation in the galaxies as a whole .",
    "though we do see indications of suppression in the groups when we compare ssfrs , the difference is subtle and might depend on the low - mass regime where we are incomplete ( galaxies with lower sfrs than we were able to detect with mips ) , or other variables .",
    "another parameter subject to transformation in dense environments is galaxy morphology .",
    "is there any difference in morphology types with respect to star formation between the group and field galaxies ?",

    "they find that the two environments tend to harbor different types of galaxies : s0 galaxies are more prevalent in groups than in the field at a fixed luminosity , indicating that suppression of star formation and bulge growth have been more common in the group environment .",
    "overall , for galaxies brighter than m@xmath46 @xmath27 -21 , they find that the groups have about 1.5 times the number of e / s0 galaxies as the field @xcite .",
    "we compared the visual morphologies with our ir sfrs using the @xcite classifications .",
    "thus , `` early - type spirals '' ( esp ) are galaxies classified as sa through sbc ( including barred spirals ) , and `` late - type spirals '' ( lsp ) are classified as sc through sm ( including barred spirals ) .",
    "the fractions of ir - detected galaxies with optical classifications ( both groups and the field ) are as follows : 13% of ellipticals , 10% of s0s , 60% of esps , 33% of lsp , 15% of irregulars , 17% of mergers , and 61% of galaxies identified as `` peculiar . ''",
    "it is perhaps a surprise that esps are twice as likely to be detected at 24  as lsps , but this difference may arise because of the lower masses of the later galaxy types .",
    "these conclusions can be tested with quantitative morphology metrics , such as the concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness method ( abraham et al .",

    "we have used their methodology to calculate ca for our sample of field and group galaxies , as shown in figure [ fig : ac ] ( small black dots ) . in the top plot , the average values ( and error bars ) for the groups and field galaxies are given by the red square and blue star , respectively .",
    "the dashed line is an arbitrary division roughly separating early- and late - type galaxies that we discuss below .",
    "consistent with @xcite , our results indicate a tendency for group galaxies to have , on average , a higher concentration and lower asymmetry ( indicative of e and s0 galaxies ) than in the field .    of 144 galaxies detected at 24 ,",
    "seven are es and four are s0s .",
    "three of the galaxies are classified as `` peculiar , '' which means they have been visually identified as either having an interacting neighbor or a morphology slightly disturbed from the given classification , and one galaxy is listed as an s0/sa ( most likely an s0 but also has sa qualities ) .",
    "still , it is unusual to find any e or s0 galaxies with sfrs at these levels . to be certain the early - type galaxy detections are robust",
    ", we investigated other possibilities for the ir emission .",
    "the first issue concerns our source matching : is it possible that there are nearby ( projected ) neighbors that are being mis - matched with the e / s0 galaxies ? as discussed in the appendix , inspection of the acs images shows that a few of the early - type galaxies have close neighbors , making identifying which galaxy in the field of view is responsible for the ir emission difficult . to be conservative , we rejected any early - type galaxies where the ir emission could be coming from another object . after removing these ambiguous e / s0 detections ,",
    "we were left with four ellipticals and two s0s firmly detected at 24 .",
    "we also double - checked our matching of the 24  positions with the irac 3.6  coordinates .",
    "four of the six e / s0 galaxies have irac coverage , and all of them match the irac coordinates within 1.5 arcsec or less .",
    "because we have imposed very stringent requirements to claim a detection , six detected e / s0 galaxies represents a lower limit .    as a double  check on the morphologies ,",
    "we again plot asymmetry and concentration for all galaxies with ca values ( small , black circles ) and the six ir - active early - type galaxies ( red circles for ellipticals and black triangles for s0s , with filled points indicating a group galaxy and empty points indicating a field galaxy ) at the bottom of figure [ fig : ac ] .",
    "all six galaxies fall in the `` early - type '' area of the plot , and they also all fall well under our early-/late - type dashed line .",
    "it appears that these six e / s0 galaxies are indeed early - types with bright 24  emission .",
    "there is one other culprit that could be masquerading as star formation , however : agns .",
    "of the six early - type galaxies with confirmed ir emission , only two have x - ray coverage , though neither of them are detected down to l@xmath47 @xmath7 10@xmath48 erg s@xmath4 @xcite . as an additional test for agns",
    ", we look to the irac data .",
    "the intersection of the stellar light and the warm / cool dust components produces a dip in the sed at rest - frame @xmath75  for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "buried agns heat the dust to higher temperatures , which `` fills in '' this dip .",
    "if our ir - detected early - type galaxies have similar colors at irac wavelengths to the typical galaxies in our sample , then agns are probably not contributing significantly to the mid - ir emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : irac ] we plot irac [ 3.6][4.5 ] and [ 3.6][5.8 ] versus redshift for all galaxies with irac coverage in our sample .",
    "most of the galaxies fall into a narrow color range in both plots , indicating that we are probing the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail of the stellar bump . if the 24  emission were dominated by an embedded agn , these colors would be more positive due to the warm dust filling in the `` dip '' in the sed , causing the sed to brighten as we move through the irac bands . none of the early - type galaxies detected at 24  ( with irac coverage ) show the signature of an agn in the irac colors .",
    "two of our six ir - bright early - type galaxies do not have x - ray or complete irac coverage .",
    "we have enough sed coverage of one of these two to make out some of the stellar bump and the increase in dust emission in the ir , which seems to indicate star formation instead of an agn , but it is difficult to say with certainty .",
    "the other source has too few photometric data points to make any solid conclusion ; however , given the lack of agns we have found so far in our entire sample , it seems that agns are a rarity .",
    "while we can not be certain that these two galaxies do not host agns , it seems unlikely .",
    "thus , even by these stringent tests , we have detected four elliptical and two s0 galaxies at 24 , none of which have an obvious agn contribution .",
    "five of these galaxies ( three ellipticals and two s0s ) are in groups .",

    "thus , the enhancement of star - forming activity in early - type galaxies at z @xmath7 0.5 compared with the present epoch may apply generally for field and group members .",

    "a minor difference is that the @xcite group sample is rich in relatively low - mass star - forming spirals compared with those in our groups .",
    "an interesting observation is that there are only two galaxies total in our group and field sample that can be classified as ulirgs ( 12 @xmath0 log(l@xmath1 ( l@xmath54 ) ) @xmath0 13 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that ulirgs make up only @xmath710% of the ir population at z @xmath7 0.7 , which roughly means , at the redshifts we are studying here , we should expect to see 412 ulirgs .",
    "while the errors on this estimate are almost certainly large enough to encompass our two ulirgs , it is still odd that our sample lies at the low end of the expected range .",
    "if galaxies in groups have higher propensities for mergers or low - velocity encounters , we might expect to see more of these high - l@xmath1 galaxies in the groups , if not overall .",

    " then either a process common to both group and field galaxies is responsible for the bulge formation or star formation from mergers and low - velocity encounters is short enough to not show significant ir emission in individual galaxies .",
    "because mass has been shown to have significant association with suppressing star formation , we also made a quantitative test of the overall similarity of group and field members of similar mass .",
    "the ratio of low - activity star forming galaxies ( i.e. , those with sfr @xmath26 2.7 m@xmath54 yr@xmath4 ) to the total number of galaxies with m@xmath5 @xmath45 10@xmath31 m@xmath54 is 0.69 .",

    "all of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the difference between the group and field populations is confined largely to their differing mass functions . for a given mass and morphological type ,",

    "thus , the group environment affects the masses and morphologies of galaxies , and their star forming properties change consistent with these effects . however , any additional changes in star forming properties are , at best , subtle , at least for sfr @xmath45 2.7 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 , indicating that the level of star formation is driven primarily by galaxy mass , itself a function of environment . in other words ,",
    "star - forming activity in individual galaxies is only indirectly related to the group versus field environment but is linked more strongly to the overall change in galaxy masses and morphologies .",
    "the higher l@xmath53 for the supergroup of @xcite may indicate an enhancement of star formation that is environmentally - dependent , but they find that mass more strongly affects star formation . apparently , the assumed increased rate of galaxy - galaxy interactions in groups either does not affect the star formation significantly , or strong interaction - driven star formation occurs in environments other than the groups we studied here .",
    "the outskirts of clusters are a probable alternative location for galaxy processing , as shown by the higher fractions of ir - bright galaxies in group and field galaxies than the outskirts of the coma and a3266 clusters @xcite .",
    "additional studies of groups and clusters at a variety of redshifts , preferably to lower sfr limits , are needed to further disentangle the effects of these moderately - dense environments on the star formation , mass , and morphology of their member galaxies .",
    "we have observed 26 galaxy groups and accompanying field galaxies with deep mips photometry and used 24  flux densities to estimate the total ir luminosities and sfrs of galaxies in both environments .",
    "we find that on an individual basis , group and field galaxies of similar mass and morphology do not differ significantly in terms of their sfrs , and the amount of star formation does not depend on the richness of the groups .",
    "however , the groups have systematically lower ssfrs and a higher incidence of massive early - type galaxies , more reminiscent of clusters than the field .",
    "we discovered that some of these e and s0 galaxies , as well as a large contingent of massive early spirals , are still forming stars at significant levels .",
    "these galaxies may explain why the flfs of the groups and field are nearly identical despite the overall decrease in star - forming activity in the groups .",
    "the group environment affects galaxy sfrs primarily through the shift toward higher masses , with an accompanying trend toward earlier types and reduced ssfrs .",
    "these high - mass , early - type galaxies , along with ir luminosities comparable to the field , put groups in between the field and clusters in terms of overall galaxy properties .",

    "<S> however , individual group galaxies have star - forming properties comparable to those of field galaxies of similar mass and morphology ; that is , the group environment does not appear to modify the properties of these galaxies directly . </S>",
    "<S> there is a relatively large number of massive early - type group spirals , along with e / s0 galaxies , that are forming stars above our detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies account for the nearly comparable level of star - forming activity in groups as compared with the field , despite the differences in mass and morphology distributions between the two environments . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of specific sfrs ( sfr / m@xmath5 ) is shifted to lower values in the groups , reflecting the fact that groups contain a higher proportion of massive and less active galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> considering the distributions of morphology , mass , and sfr , the group members appear to lie between field and cluster galaxies in overall properties . </S>"
