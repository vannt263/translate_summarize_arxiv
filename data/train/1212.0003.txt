    "almost at the fag end of the last century there was a great blow to the standard cosmology due to the observational prediction [ 1 - 3 ] that the universe is passing through an accelerating phase .",
    "as a result the standard cosmology was tuned either physically by incorporating dominant matter component having large negative pressure ( known as dark energy ( de ) ) or geometrically , by introducing modified gravity theories .    in the recent past , a lot of work has been going on universal thermodynamics , mostly with apparent horizon as the boundary .",
    "the pioneer work of wang _ et al . _",
    "[ 4 ] has made a comparative study of the two horizons ( apparent and event ) by examining the validity of the thermodynamical laws for de fluids . based on their results ,",
    "they have concluded that universe bounded by the apparent horizon is a bekenstein system while cosmological event horizon is unphysical from thermodynamical point of view .",
    "however , due to the relevance of the cosmological event horizon in the present de dominated universe , we have shown [ 5 ] the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) on the event horizon ( in any gravity theory ) assuming the validity of the first law with some reasonable restrictions .",
    "subsequently , it was possible to show [ 6 ] the validity of the first law of thermodynamics on the event horizon for some simple de fluids with a modified hawking temperature on the event horizon . also very recently ,",
    "thermodynamical equilibrium has been studied [ 7,8 ] for universe bounded by any of the two horizons and for various de models .",
    "motivated by one of the latest work of radicella and pavon [ 9 ] on the thermodynamic motivation for de , in the present work , we make an attempt to show that universe bounded by event horizon is favoured by de fluid from thermodynamical point of view _",
    "i.e. , _ validity of gslt as well as thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "according to thermodynamics , the equilibrium configuration of an isolated macroscopic physical system should be the maximum entropy state ( consistent with the constraints imposed on the system ) .",
    "thus if s be the entropy of the system then we must have [ 7,10 ] +   + i ) @xmath0 ( _ i.e. , _ the entropy function can not decrease , the second law of thermodynamics ) + ii)@xmath1 ( _ i.e. , _ the entropy function attains a maximum ) .",
    "+ in the present context , the universe filled with de fluid and bounded by the horizon is considered as an isolated macroscopic system for which the above inequalities are generalized as [ 7 ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the entropies of the horizon and that of the fluid within it respectively .    now in order to determine the entropy variations we shall use the simplest form of the first law of thermodynamics ( _ i.e. , _ clausius relation ) , @xmath5 and the gibb s relation",

    "[ 8 ] , it has been shown that although gslt is satisfied for any fluid distribution bounded by the apparent horizon but equilibrium criteria is not satisfied in the quintessence era even for perfect fluid with constant equation of state . however , for universe bounded by the event horizon both gslt and equilibrium configuration are satisfied with some realistic conditions . in the next section , the thermodynamical prescriptions are studied in details for some specific choices of de models , for apparent / event horizon and it is examined whether de favours one of the horizons or not . +   +   +",

    "[ 14 ] that an interaction ( between holographic de and dm which is in the form of dust ) model of the universe mimicks the observationally measured phantom equation of state as compared to non - interaction models which may predict the equation of state to be of a non - phantom type .",
    "moreover , observational data from the cmb [ 15 ] and matter distribution at large scales [ 16 ] favour the interaction models .",
    "it is therefore very natural to consider models where dark energy interacts with dark matter .    the variable equation of state parameter for the holographic de has the form [ 4,17 ] @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a dimensionless parameter ( estimated from the observation ) , the interaction term has the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 as the coupling parameter between de and dm .",

    "further , we have added the lensing data as it improves the constraints by 2%-15% .",
    "also , no evident tension has been found [ 18 ] when _ planck _ data is combined with bao , _ hst _ and union 2.1 data sets .",

    "however , we have plotted @xmath73 against the coupling parameter @xmath64 for the above three _ planck _",
    "data sets in fig .",
    "it is evident from the figure that equilibrium configuration for universe bounded by apparent horizon is not satisfied for any of the three _",

    "in other words , in quintessence era , gslt holds if @xmath54 ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath76 ) . however , for equilibrium configuration ( _ i.e. , @xmath77 _ ) , we have an upper bound on @xmath78 namely @xmath79 , _",

    "the evolution of the radius of the event horizon and the velocity of the event horizon respectively , has been presented and it is clear from the figures that both @xmath14 and @xmath78 increase sharply at the early phases of the evolution of the universe and then they approach a constant value at late times .",
    "further , figs . 6 and 8",
    "show that @xmath30 and @xmath78 are positive throughout the evolution , so gslt is always satisfied in the case of event horizon .",
    "we have also shown @xmath91 graphically for varying @xmath82 in fig .",
    "9 . from the figure",
    ", it can be concluded that thermodynamical equilibrium configuration is possible for universe bounded by the event horizon .",
    "it should be noted that in the early epochs , the mcg model behaves as a perfect fluid having equation of state @xmath92 , so the choices @xmath93 and @xmath94 correspond to ultra relativistic and radiation era respectively while @xmath95 stands for generalized chaplygin gas model and @xmath96 indicates dark energy state .",
    "the choices of the other parameters are arbitrary , consistent with the restrictions @xmath97 and @xmath85 ( mentioned above ) .",
    "finally , it must be mentioned here that in deriving eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 20 ) , we have assumed that the fluid inside the horizon has the same temperature as that of the horizon itself .",
    "this paper deals with an extensive study of equilibrium thermodynamics for three different choices of de models namely ( a ) perfect fluid with constant equation of state , ( b ) holographic dark energy ( hde ) model and ( c ) modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model .",
    "the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) is always satisfied for universe bounded by the apparent horizon while for the event horizon , gslt is satisfied with some restrictions on the radii / velocities of the horizons or on the fluid parameters .",
    "however , from the point of view of thermodynamical equilibrium configuration , apparent horizon seems to be less favourable than event horizon at least for these three choices of de models . for perfect",
    "fluid with constant equation of state , equilibrium configuration holds only in the phantom domain for apparent horizon while it is possible to achieve equilibrium configuration both in the quintessence era and in the phantom era for event horizon with some realistic restrictions ( _ see _ table i ) . in the case of hde model , the condition(s ) for equilibrium configuration to hold good is / are very complicated for both the horizons ( _ see _ eqs . (",
    "16 ) _ and _ ( 19 ) ) .",
    "so , based on three different choices of _ planck _ data sets , we have plotted the second order derivative of the total entropy for both the horizons ( _ see _ figs . 2 _ and _ 3 ) and it is found that equilibrium condition is violated for apparent horizon for all choices of the coupling parameter @xmath64 while in the case of event horizon",
    ", equilibrium configuration is attained for @xmath98 ( _ approx . _ ) .",
    "also , in the case of event horizon , we have presented in tables iii and iv , the bounds on the density parameter for the validity of thermodynamical equilibrium . in the case of mcg model",
    ", graphical representation again shows that equilibrium configuration is not possible for apparent horizon with @xmath99 while it is possible to have equilibrium configuration in the case of event horizon for @xmath99 .",
    "thus universe bounded by the event horizon is a perfect thermodynamical system ( second law of thermodynamics is valid for the system and thermodynamical equilibrium is attained ) for the above de models and hence it is reasonable to assume that the temperature of the fluid is same as that of the horizon .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that de ( which is predicted by recent observations ) favurs event horizon for universal thermodynamics .",
