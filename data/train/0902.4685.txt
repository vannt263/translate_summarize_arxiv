    ", the field will split in two orthogonal components as @xmath1    the walls of the cavity are situated at @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the tangential component of the field should vanish on the conducting walls , that is @xmath5 on the cylinder surface @xmath2 and @xmath6 at @xmath7 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "inside the hollow cavity the field will obey the wave equation @xmath8    or @xmath9    for the case of harmonic field of frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the axial component of the space part of the electric field obeys the same equation : @xmath11    and so does the transverse part @xmath12 .",
    "the equation can be written in cylindrical coordinates as @xmath13    and assumes a separate solution of the type @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the helmholtz pde above becomes @xmath15    or @xmath16    the reflections at the top @xmath17and bottom @xmath3 surfaces impose a z - dependence appropriate for standing waves .",
    "thus , in the eq . ( 1.6 ) the constant @xmath18 and the solution @xmath19 will be a combination of @xmath20 which will obey the boundary conditions .",
    "further , in order to have a uniform @xmath21 dependence , @xmath22 should be of the form @xmath23 with integer @xmath24    thus , the radial equation becomes @xmath25    where @xmath26 .",
    "the equation ( 1.7 ) is the bessel equation of order @xmath27 and the solution is a combination of bessel and neumann functions of order m , @xmath28 . if we take into account that the solution should be finite for any @xmath29 , including @xmath30 and remember the behavior of bessel and neumann functions in the vicinity of the origin @xmath31    respectively @xmath32    for @xmath33 and @xmath34\\ ] ]    than only @xmath35 is acceptable , because the second solution is singular at the origin . in the case of transverse magnetic ( tm )",

    "also , the boundary condition @xmath44 for @xmath2 requires that the argument @xmath45 should be one of the zeros of the bessel function @xmath46 .",

    "the general solution of the field equations ( 1.10 ) inside the cavity that obeys the appropriate boundary conditions will be a superposition of the normal modes :    @xmath51    the resonance frequencies of the cavity will depend on three parameters and will be given in the case of tm modes by @xmath52    with m=0,1,2 , ... n=1,2 , ... p=0,1,2 , ...",

    "since the origin @xmath30 no longer belongs to the domain of values that @xmath57 assumes , than the particular solution of the radial equation will be now a linear combination of both bessel and neumann functions : @xmath58    in order that the field to satisfy homogenous boundary conditions on both @xmath59and @xmath2 boundaries , the radial funtion above should assume the form @xmath60\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 are the solutions of the equation @xmath62    they will be determined by appropriate numerical methods .    in the case of tm modes , the general solution for the axial component",

    "the presented formulae allow an exact calculus of the electric field inside axial cavities with conducting walls , which may be used for a rigorous evaluation of the radiation thermal flux in such a system . for cryogenic systems ,",
    "the numerical calculations need such accurate formulae , taking into account that a large number of coaxial insulators will be used and any errors will propagate and will be recursively amplified . the only way to minimize the global errors is to keep them as low as possible at any stage , thus involving from the beginning these exact analytical solutions .",
