    "the qcd multipole expansion ( qcdme ) has been widely used to calculate transition rates among heavy quarkonia by emitting pions , @xcite .",
    "since this theory refers to non - perturbative qcd , it has a limited application range , beyond this range the theory is no longer applicable . when the masses of the charmonia ( bottononia ) are sufficiently large beyond the production thresholds of @xmath7(@xmath8 ) which may become on - shell intermediate states , as eichtein et al .",
    "indicate , the decay widths evaluated in terms of the qcdme are smaller than the data by three orders@xcite . in other words , the dominant modes of , say , @xmath9 or @xmath10 can be realized via @xmath11 , which is usually referred as the final state interaction or re - scattering process .",
    "even though the re - scattering process dominates the transition , the direct pion emission is still contributing and is evaluated in terms of the qcdme .",
    "it is interesting to theoretically estimate how small the contribution of the direct pion emission could be in comparison with the dominant one .    to serve the purpose",
    ", we adopt a simple decay mode to do the job , i.e. calculate the contribution of a direct @xmath12 emission to the decay rate of @xmath2 .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "the direct @xmath12 emission is an ozi suppressed and moreover causes an isospin violation .",
    "the double suppression determines that the contribution from the direct pion emission must be small .",
    "in fact , unless other mechanisms are forbidden by some reasons , such as constraints of available phase space or other symmetries , the direct pion emission can not make substantial contribution to the decay rates as eichten et al .",
    "suggest . to quantitatively confirm eichten s statement , we use both the @xmath6 model and qcdme to calculate their contribution to the decay rate separately .",
    "our numerical results show that the effective coupling constant @xmath14 determined by qcdme is 60@xmath15 70 times smaller than that obtained from quark pair creation ( qpc ) .",
    "after the introduction , in section [ s2 ] , we evaluate the contributions to the decay rate of the @xmath13 from both the quark pair creation ( qpc ) described by the @xmath6 model and the direct pion emission described by the qcdme respectively in subsections [ ss21 ] and [ ss22 ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented following the formulations in the section and comparisons with the corresponding experimental data are made . in the final section",
    "we will discuss the framework in some details and then draw our conclusion .",
    "in the framework of the qpc model@xcite , the decay @xmath13 occurs via a quark - antiquark pair creation from the vacuum .",
    "it is an okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) allowed process .",
    "the decay mechanism is displayed in fig.[3p0 ] graphically .",
    "the picture is that many soft gluons are emitted from the quark and anti - quark legs which then annihilate into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "equivalently , the physics scenario can be described as that a quark pair is excited out from vacuum .",
    "the @xmath6 model has been widely applied to calculate such hadronic strong decays .    .",

    "it is noted that the pion can be directly emitted before @xmath3 transits into @xmath4 , thus the amplitude , in principle , should be added to the process depicted in above subsection and interferes with it . just by the qualitative analysis ,",
    "the one - pion emission is an ozi suppressed process and moreover , it violates isospin conservation , therefore must be much small compared to the vacuum creation .",
    "it is obviously interesting to investigate such an effect in other processes , i.e. as long as the one - pion emission is not a leading term , how small it would be compared with the leading ones .",

    "our numerical results for decay mode @xmath94 confirm that the direct pion emission is not the leading term and the contributions determined by the qcdme must be much smaller than that induced by other mechanisms .",
    "let us try to understand the smallness of the contribution from direct pion emission , namely using data to convince that our estimate is reasonable .",
    "there are two suppression factors : the one - pion emission violates the isospin conservation and qcdme is an ozi suppressed mechanism . comparing with the vacuum quark pair creation ,",
    "it must be small and we see that its contribution to the decay width ranges about @xmath95 kev . as we know , the decay @xmath96 is also an isospin violation and ozi suppressed process , its branching ratio is @xmath97@xcite , slightly larger than our estimate for @xmath94 . that further suppression factor is coming from the fact that the transition @xmath96 is an @xmath98wave process , whereas @xmath13 is a @xmath99wave one",
    "whose decay width is proportional to the three - momentum @xmath100 which is small , so the decay width @xmath92 suffers from a p - wave suppression .",

    "@xmath103 can only occur via a direct pion emission , so is completely determined by the qcdme mechanism , and its partial width is about 0.26 kev . since it is an s - wave process , it does not suffer from the p - wave suppression . in @xmath101",
    "decays , the mode @xmath104 is not seen , but @xmath105 has been measured , and its branching ratio is not too small ( @xmath106 ) , that is because the direct emission of three pions does not violate the isospin conservation .",
    "equivalently , the qcdme can be replaced by the chiral perturbation theory , for example the transition of @xmath107 was studied in terms of the chiral theory@xcite .",
    "moreover , we have extended our mechanism to study the non - resonant three - body decays of @xmath108 where the weak interaction gets involved .",
    "the contribution has been studied by cheng et al . in terms of the chiral perturbation theory and we have re - done the evaluation by means of qcdme .",
    "we will present the relevant results in our next work .    as a conclusion",
    ", we confirm the validity of the qcdem and determine its application region .",
    "it is indicated that since the framework applies only to the direct pion emission , if there are other mechanisms to contribute , such as the quark - pair creation from vacuum to @xmath2 ; or @xmath109 where an intermediate state of @xmath110 portal is open , i.e the available energy is above the production threshold of @xmath110 , the direct emission induced by the qcdme is no longer the leading term and can only contribute tiny fraction .",
