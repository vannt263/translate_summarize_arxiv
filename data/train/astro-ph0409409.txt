    "optical , uv , and x - ray absorption troughs in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) spectra are central to the ongoing effort to understand not only mass outflow in agn , but to provide clues to the fueling of their central supermassive black holes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "although the optical depth , metallicity , and velocity of such outflows are becoming increasingly well - constrained , the mechanism accelerating the winds remains elusive : thermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , continuum - driven ( for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , line - driven ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hydromagnetic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) winds may all provide insight , but none of the above models have been excluded or are definitively observationally preferred for agn outflows .    in this letter ,",
    "observational constraints on continuum - driven winds launched from very near the central black hole are examined .",
    "such wind models have become significant , as observations of outflows apparently moving at large fractions of the speed of light ( @xmath20.10.4c ) have been published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . from the measured high velocities ,",
    "the winds are inferred to be launched very close to the central black hole . @xcite",
    "have proposed that the highly - ionized gas is subject to continuum driving near the central black hole because line driving is unlikely to be important for the large ionization parameters in these winds .    a model of a continuum - driven wind",
    "is presented in  [ modeloverview ] .",
    "this model is used to investigate terminal velocities and absorption features displayed by a variety of winds with different incident continua , initial shielding columns , and densities at the base of the wind (  [ results ] ) .",
    "our simple continuum - driven wind model consists of a radial streamline set to rise above the disk at a constant angle of @xmath3 to the disk , with the initial column ( @xmath4 ) and number density ( @xmath5 ) of the wind specified by the user .",
    "gas with that initial density is assumed to be in keplerian motion and is perturbed into the central , illuminating continuum with an initial velocity of roughly the local sound speed . to determine the gas s motion due to continuum acceleration ,",
    "cloudy @xcite simulations are run on a radial rays through the wind , spaced logarithmically in co - latitude . the continuum acceleration on the gas",
    "is then computed using both the ionization state and transmitted continuum ( therefore taking account of any self - shielding effects ) at the end of each radial slice through the wind , taking into account both electron scattering and bound - free opacities .",
    "the radiative acceleration is calculated and then compared to gravity in @xmath6 , defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the continuum radiative acceleration , @xmath9 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath10 is the density in the wind , @xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 is the frequency - dependent continuum opacity ( output by cloudy ) , @xmath13 is the transmitted continuum ( again , given by cloudy ) , @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the mass of the central black hole , and @xmath16 is the spherical radius .",
    "this @xmath6 factor is then input into the euler equation along with the component of gravity and centrifugal acceleration along the radial flowline : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath19 is the co - latitude , @xmath20 is the ( fixed ) angle of the flowline from the vertical , and @xmath21 is the azimuthal velocity ( angular momentum is conserved in outflowing gas ) .",
    "we integrate this equation to compute the velocity of the wind as a function of distance along the radial streamline . as that velocity increases ,",
    "the number density in the wind ( as well as the column density ) decreases via mass conservation . for the first set of cloudy simulations , where no velocity data are available , the density is set to fall as @xmath22",
    "; this initial density distribution is replaced in subsequent iterations and is unimportant for the final results .",
    "the solution is iterated at least twice to ensure that the density structure is consistent with the velocity profile in the wind ; simulations in test cases have shown that the wind structure does not change after two iterations , even when ten iterations are completed .",
    "the wind parameters chosen in this paper reproduce the observational constraints on the outflow observed by @xcite in the narrow emission line quasar pg  1211 + 143 .",
    "they observed an outflow with @xmath23 and an inferred density of @xmath24 , situated at @xmath25 from the black hole ( this density is estimated observationally from the emission measure and line - of - sight column density ; see * ? ? ?",
    "they also inferred a launching radius of @xmath26 by noting that @xmath27 , the escape velocity for that @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the covering factor of the flow , @xmath31 is the radial distance , @xmath10 is the mass density , and @xmath32 the velocity of the wind ) must be constant along the flow , an original density of @xmath33 is inferred for the base of the wind if the initial velocity is of order @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( the value of @xmath30 used in * ? ? ?",
    "observations indicate that @xmath36 @xcite ( with significant uncertainty noted in the analysis ) ; we retain the value of @xmath37 to compare with previous models . ] , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 as the  big blue bump  that dominates the continuum in pg  1211 + 143 has @xmath40  erg / s ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred mass outflow rate from the observations is @xmath41 ( for the covering fraction @xmath35 ) .",
    "we assume solar abundances .",
    "the increase of density towards the base of the wind ( where the gas is outflowing much more slowly ) results in a large increase in the column density over the observed column of @xmath42 . as recognized by @xcite",
    ", this column would be significantly optically thick , precluding photoionization simulations .",
    "two possibilities are therefore considered in our simulations .",
    "first , `` standard '' winds are tested with @xmath43 at the base of the outflow and with an agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "next , winds are launched by a soft x - ray / uv blackbody from the photosphere of an optically thick shield , as hypothesized by @xcite .",
    "the most immediate check for these outflows is to see which parameters lead to the observed velocities .",
    "figure  [ vinfplot ] displays @xmath44 as a function of the eddington ratio ( @xmath44 here is the velocity at the end of the model s streamline at a distance of @xmath45 where @xmath28 is the launch radius of our wind ; taking the terminal velocity at @xmath46 only changes @xmath44 by @xmath47 in tests ) .",
    "this figure shows the variation in @xmath44 for both an agn sed @xcite  k ,",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . ] and for a blackbody continuum with a range of temperatures ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "as a simple starting case , the winds presented here are optically thin , with @xmath51 ; higher columns are considered below .",
    "as expected , when @xmath52 , the wind does not reach @xmath53 , even with the added bound - free opacity used to calculating the continuum acceleration . for @xmath54 , winds can achieve the observed velocities .",
    "figure  [ vinfplot ] clearly shows that the blackbody continuum can also accelerate a wind , resulting in almost identical velocities as when the @xcite sed is used .",
    "this seems reasonable since the majority of @xmath55 is given by frequency - independent electron scattering .",
    "next , to test the sensitivity of these results to initial parameters , both the column and the initial density of the wind are varied ( see fig .  [ vinfplotre04 ] ) for winds illuminated with the agn sed from @xcite .",
    "this shows that changing the initial density by an order of magnitude ( which increases @xmath56 by the same factor ) does not change the velocity structure of the wind significantly , due to the fact that the continuum is strong enough to highly ionize both winds . for such highly - ionized continuum driven winds",
    ", the degree of acceleration is governed by @xmath57 which is nearly identical for both winds ( although the higher - density wind does have a lower ionization parameter near the base of the wind , yielding larger accelerations there than in the lower - density wind ) .    also in figure  [ vinfplotre04 ] , the shielding column at the base of the wind is varied from the normal @xmath51 to @xmath58 to investigate the `` self - shielding '' of a thicker wind .",
    "this thicker column also does not change the final velocities in the outflow .",
    "these figures address the range of eddington ratios necessary to launch a wind to the observed velocity .",
    "but what are the particular spectral signatures of such a wind ? to answer this question ,",
    "figures  [ xiplot ] and [ xiplotre04 ] show the x - ray ionization parameter , @xmath59 , as a function of @xmath60 for those different models .",
    "we define @xmath59 in the same manner as cloudy and xstar : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the integrated x - ray flux from 1 to 1000 rydbergs . to pick one `",
    "fiducial ' @xmath59 out of the range of ionization parameters in the accelerating wind , @xmath59 is extracted at a distance along the flow of @xmath63 ( chosen to compare with the inferred distance of the wind in pg  1211 + 143 ) .",
    "figures  [ xiplot ] and [ xiplotre04 ] display the ionization parameters in these continuum - driven winds .",
    "they show that the high velocity , continuum - driven winds must by necessity have been accelerated by a large incident flux , which , for agn - like continua , leads to extremely high ionization parameters in the wind ( @xmath59 of order @xmath64 for @xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath65k blackbody spectrum also has a very high ionization parameter , but all of its energy in the 1 - 1000 rydberg window is concentrated near 1 rydberg .",
    "thus , even though this continuum has a large ionization parameter , the lack of x - ray photons means that the ionization stages within the gas are much lower than that produced by an agn sed : for instance , the predominant state of iron for the wind illuminated by the @xmath65k blackbody spectrum is fe  ix , while the observed iron ions are fe  xxv and fe  xxvi @xcite .",
    "this has important implications for observations of such winds .",
    "@xcite postulated that continuum driven winds could account for high - velocity x - ray absorption features .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , there have been other recent observations of such high - velocity x - ray absorption in a variety of qsos @xcite . in observations of pg  1211 + 143 , significant equivalent widths ( ews ) for absorption features in mg  xii , s  xvi , fe  xxv , and fe",
    "xxvi are seen .",
    "table  [ ewtable ] compares these observations to models of a high - column wind with an agn sed @xcite , @xmath66 , assumed line widths of 1000 km / s @xcite and @xmath67 .",
    "equivalent widths are calculated in the linear weak line limit : @xmath68\\ ] ] for @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the optical depth in the line from cloudy and @xmath71 is the doppler width of the line in ev ( all of the lines shown here have @xmath69 in the wind ) .",
    "a comparison of observed ews to the model ews clearly shows that , because of the high ionization in the outflow , such winds can not account for the ews observed in pg  1211 + 143 .",
    "the ews for winds illuminated with a blackbody spectrum are even smaller , although in that case the small ews are due to the lack of high - energy ionizing x - rays .",
    "to test the particular parameters presented by @xcite , we assembled a model with a constant column of @xmath72 present throughout the wind .",
    "although the density still declines with height above the disk as before , we set the column to a constant value for every line of sight through the wind .",
    "this would therefore yield the column of @xmath72 at @xmath63 as observed by @xcite .",
    "this model differs strongly from the other solutions where the column drops consistently as the density in the wind falls .",
    "the last column of table  [ ewtable ] displays the ews from this model with @xmath73 ; at higher @xmath60 , the ews only decrease .",
    "even with the constant column supplying a greater column of the relevant ions , the ionization parameter in the model is so high that the line equivalent widths fall below the 90% confidence interval of the measurements .",
    "we have searched for some area of parameter space that might allow such continuum - driven winds to show the observed equivalent widths .",
    "the only possibility we have found is modifying the incident continuum such that @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) . while inconsistent with the observed power law of @xmath76 , this does yield equivalent widths consistent with the observations for all lines except fe  xxv , but only for the wind with constant column of @xmath77@xmath78 along the entire outflow",
    "however , in the rather implausible case that the x - ray continuum is formed outside the wind ( so that the wind sees a different x - ray continuum than is observed ) , such a model does reproduce the observed equivalent widths .    as a final consideration , we note that for a large outflow with covering factor @xmath35 , p - cygni profiles should be observed , but emission is not seen with the observed absorption lines .",
    "this may perhaps indicate a smaller covering fraction for the wind .",

    "this letter addresses observational constraints on winds launched from near the central black hole of agns using pure continuum driving .",
    "this has become an increasingly significant topic very recently , with the observation of high - velocity , very highly ionized gas in several different qsos , where the outflow is most likely too highly ionized to allow for significant line driving .",
    "as expected , continuum driving can accelerate highly - ionized winds from near the central black hole to the observed velocities when @xmath90 .",
    "but the models also indicate that :    1 .",
    "changes in the initial density or shielding column do not affect the final velocity of the wind . nor do changes in the illuminating continuum significantly change the final velocities in the wind , although moving to softer continua does significantly lower the ionization state .",
    "continuum - driven winds , illuminated by an agn sed and accelerating to the observed velocities quickly become very highly ionized ( with @xmath91 for @xmath90 ) , completely stripping the outflowing gas , resulting in acceleration primarily by electron scattering .",
    "continuum - driven winds can be launched by blackbody seds but such outflows do not have the observed high - ionization lines .",
    "3 .   taking the particular example of the outflow observed in pg  1211 + 143 @xcite",
    ", wind models display much smaller ews than the observed ews .",
    "softening the x - ray power law to @xmath92 can increase the ews , however this requires both a non - standard agn continuum and a constant - column disk wind .    if pure continuum driving has difficulty reproducing the observations , what process is accelerating the wind ?",
    "first , perhaps the wind is not relativistic ( see * ? ? ? * who finds the low - energy x - ray spectrum of pg  1211 + 143 to be consistent with a 3000 km / s outflow ) .",
    "it may also be possible that line - driving is playing a role , although such acceleration would have to occur only at the very base of the wind , where the ionization parameter is suitably low and where radiative launching would be difficult given the high column to the central source near the disk ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "another option for explaining these outflows is a multi - phase wind , although such a wind would increase the mass outflow rate beyond its already large value .",
    "another possibility is that such high - velocity , highly - ionized winds could be launched hydromagnetically .",
    "the addition of hydromagnetic driving would decouple the ionization state from the acceleration process ; instead of requiring , as for continuum - driven flows , that the luminosity be @xmath93 or greater ( which leads to over - ionization ) , the wind could possibly be accelerated by mhd forces that would allow a lower @xmath60 and a lower ionization state .",
    "indeed , a lower @xmath60 may already be indicated by the larger @xmath15 ( albeit with large uncertainty ) found by @xcite .",
    "mhd wind models will be addressed in a subsequent paper , but we point out that the large mass outflow rates ( @xmath94 ) inferred in this source may be too high for an mhd outflow .",
    "model predictions for winds driven by all of the above processes will be useful in determining which forces are capable of launching these outflows and which model outflows are consistent with the observational signatures .    we thank the referee for helpful comments that improved the paper , and doron chelouche , arieh knigl , & norm murray for their comments .",
