    "the ground state and low lying excited states of many atomic nuclei all over the nuclide chart show quadrupole deformation in their intrinsic states @xcite .",
    "this property has profound consequences in the low lying spectrum of those nuclei as well as in their decay patterns @xcite .",
    "octupole deformation is not as common as quadrupole deformation as a characteristic of the ground state of atomic nuclei , but its consequences are important for understanding nuclear properties of several actinide nuclei around radium and several rare earth around barium @xcite .",
    "the octupole operator has negative parity and therefore a non - zero octupole deformation means that the intrinsic state has lost reflection symmetry and acquired a pear - like shape .",
    "the quantum interference between the two degenerate intrinsic states with pear - shaped matter distributions pointing upward and downward ( i.e. with the same absolute value of the octupole moment but opposite sign ) restores the parity quantum number and leads to the presence in the spectrum of a doublet with opposite parities @xcite .",
    "the energy splitting between the two members of the doublet strongly depends upon the properties of the barrier separating the two degenerate intrinsic states with opposite octupole moment . in deformed even - even nuclei",
    "it is possible that the negative parity member of the ground state multiplet , the lowest lying @xmath0 state , can be located below the lowest @xmath4state leading to the appearance of alternating parity rotational bands , which are clear signatures of octupole deformation .",
    "also , the two members of the doublet will be connected by strong @xmath5 transition probabilities from the @xmath0 to the ground state .",
    "the next member of the negative parity rotational band is a @xmath6 that rapidly decays to the @xmath7ground state by means of strong @xmath8 transition probabilities .",
    "although there are several known examples of alternating parity rotational bands at low spins , the alternating behavior usually appears at high spins as a consequence of the stabilizing effect of angular momentum on the octupolarity of the system : moments of inertia increase with the octupole moment and therefore configurations with higher octupole moments are the more lowered by increasing angular momentum .",
    "the appearance of octupole effects is strongly linked to the position of the fermi energy in the single particle spectrum of the underlying mean field @xcite .",
    "the reason is that octupolarity is enhanced when , in a given major shell , the intruder orbital interacts ( via a particle - hole excitation ) with a nearby normal parity orbital with three units less of angular momentum ( @xmath9 is the amount of angular momentum carried out by the octupole operator ) .",
    "this happens between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 spherical orbitals , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "those regions where both protons and neutrons feel a strong octupole interaction is where octupole related effects are expected to be more pronounced . for example , in the region around @xmath16ra , the fermi level of protons is located around the @xmath13orbital that can then interact strongly with the empty @xmath12 . besides , fermi level of neutrons is around the @xmath11 orbital , which strongly interacts through the octupole interaction with the @xmath10 one .",
    "similar arguments apply to the region around @xmath17ba with the orbitals @xmath15 and @xmath14 for protons and the @xmath13 and @xmath12 for neutrons responsible for octupolar effects .",
    "last but not least , octupolarity also plays a relevant role in the asymmetric fission decay mode because an octupole deformed pathway to fission naturally explain the observed asymmetric mass fragment distribution of several actinide parent nuclei @xcite .    in this article",
    "we want to check the ability of the recently proposed barcelona - catania - paris ( bcp ) energy density functionals @xcite , in dealing with the octupole degree of freedom in finite nuclei .",
    "we will compare the results provided by the bcp functionals in some test cases with experimental values , when available , and with the results obtained using the gogny d1s interaction that we take here as a benchmark .",
    "the bcp energy density functionals consist of a bulk part which is fully microscopic and comes from the nuclear and neutron equation of state @xcite which are parametrized in a polynomial form complemented by additional terms accounting for finite size effects ( see @xcite for functionals inspired in the same principles ) .",
    "in addition to the coulomb term and the spin - orbit contribution , which is taken exactly as in the skyrme or gogny forces , we add a purely phenomenological finite range term for describing properly the nuclear surface . to deal with open - shell nuclei we still include in the bcp functionals a zero range density - dependent pairing interaction fitted to reproduce the nuclear matter gaps obtained with the gogny force @xcite .",
    "the only free parameters of these functionals are the isospin like ( l ) and unlike ( u ) strengths of the surface term , the range of the gaussian form factor used to give a finite range to the surface term and the strength of the spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "these free parameters are adjusted in the usual way to reproduce the ground state energy and charge radii of some selected spherical nuclei . with these ingredients ,",
    "the bcp functionals give an excellent description of 161 even - even spherical nuclei with rms values for the ground - state energies ( 1.77 mev and 2.06 mev ) for bcp1 and bcp2 , respectively ) and charge radii that are comparable to the ones obtained with well reputed interactions / functionals like skyrme sly4 ( 1.71 mev ) , gogny d1s ( 2.41 mev ) or the relativistic nl3 parametrization ( 3.58 mev ) .",
    "apart from the advantages already mentioned in @xcite , the bcp functionals are advantageous in its application to finite nuclei because of its reduced computational cost as compared to gogny ( bcp is a factor between 6 to 10 faster ) or even skyrme ( comparable computational cost ) .",
    "also the appearance of integer powers of the density in the bulk part of the functional , which is a consequence of the specific fit to the nuclear matter results , makes much easier to deal with the self - energy problem that plagues beyond mean field calculation @xcite . using these bcp functionals we have also explored quadrupole deformation properties @xcite .",
    "we find a behavior similar to that obtained using the gogny d1s force widely used to this end .",
    "this fact give us confidence in using the bcp functionals to study nuclear properties related to deformation .",
    "as the bcp functionals are aimed at describing not only masses and radii but also the low lying spectrum over all the nuclide chart , it is necessary to check whether the very reasonable results regarding quadrupole collectivity can also be extended to the octupole deformation case . to check that this is the case , we have carried out mean field hartree- fock- bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations with the bcp energy density functional as well as the gogny @xcite d1s @xcite interaction to test the response of the system to the octupole degree of freedom . to be more precise ,",
    "we have used a constraint in the axially symmetric octupole moment to generate potential energy curves ( pecs ) to search for octupole deformed minima as well as to study the stiffness of those ( and other ) minima against changes in the octupole degree of freedom .",
    "these pecs are computed for several isotopes of radium from @xmath18ra to @xmath19ra and of barium from @xmath20ba until @xmath21ba . in addition to the pec , the calculation of the corresponding collective inertias allows the evaluation of the @xmath0 excitation energy as well as @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition probabilities in the framework of the collective schrdinger equation ( cse ) method .",
    "the results will be compared with experimental data , when available , as well as with the results obtained with the gogny d1s force .",
    "it should be mentioned that the gogny d1s results have already been reported in refs . @xcite and",
    "similar calculations with the skyrme interactions exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "finally , the octupole properties of the fission valley of @xmath3pu will also be briefly discussed and compared to those of gogny d1s .",
    "to solve the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equation @xcite the quasi - particle operators of the bogoliubov transformation have been expanded in a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis big enough as to warrant convergence of the results with the basis size .",
    "the expansion coefficients have been determined by means of the gradient method which relies on the parametrization of the mean field ( hfb ) energy in terms of the parameters of the thouless expansion of the most general hfb wave functions . within the gradient method , the hfb problem is recast in terms of a minimization ( variational ) process of the mean field energy and the search of the minimum is performed by following the direction of the gradient in the multidimensional space of parameters .",
    "the advantage of this method over the more traditional one of successive diagonalizations is in the way the constraints are implemented , which allows a larger number of them to be treated at once .",
    "axial symmetry has been preserved in the calculation implying the use of an axially symmetric ho basis made up of the tensor product of two dimensional ho wave functions times one dimensional ho ones .",
    "along with the octupole moment constraint associated to the multipole operator @xmath22 and used to generate the pec s , we have included a constraint on the center of mass of the nucleus ( i.e. the mean value of @xmath23 has been set to zero ) to prevent spuriousness associated to the center of mass motion , to slip into the results . as a consequence of the axial symmetry imposed in the hfb wave functions , the mean values of the @xmath24 multipole operators with @xmath25 are zero by construction .",
    "the information given by mean field theories is restricted to the energy and shape of the -generally- deformed ground state . to restore the parity symmetry broken by the mean field approximation and to describe the dynamics of the collective excited states it is mandatory to go beyond the mean field approximation . with this in mind , the octupole degree of freedom @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the hfb intrinsic wave function ) has been used to build up a collective hamiltonian based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) and the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the goa is used to reduce the hill - wheeler equation of the gcm to a schrdinger equation for the collective wave function , the so - called collective schrdinger equation ( cse ) @xmath28 where the collective hamiltonian @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 in this expression @xmath31 is the metric , @xmath32 is the mass parameter associated with the collective motion along @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the collective potential given by the hfb energy @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the zero point energy ( zpe ) correction .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ schcol ] ) have to be normalized to one with the metric @xmath31 @xmath38 to preserve the hermiticity of @xmath39 .",
    "it should be mentioned that a cse can also be obtained from the adiabatic time dependent hartree- fock ( atdhf ) theory @xcite after quantization of the semi - classical hamiltonian for the slow moving collective degrees of freedom .",
    "the collective hamiltonian obtained in this way has the same functional form as the gcm+goa one , but the expression of the collective parameters is different .",
    "later we will discuss how to choose these collective parameters .",
    "an interesting characteristic of the collective hamiltonian for the octupole degree of freedom is that @xmath29 is invariant under the exchange @xmath40 and , therefore , it is possible to classify its eigenfunctions , @xmath37 , according to their parity under the @xmath40 exchange .",
    "it is easy to see that the parity of the collective wave function under the @xmath40 exchange corresponds to the spatial parity operation in the correlated wave function built up from @xmath41 .",
    "the inclusion of octupole correlations immediately restores the parity symmetry lost at the mean field level .",
    "therefore , the solution of the cse eq .",
    "( [ schcol ] ) allows the calculation of the @xmath42 energy splitting and the b(e1 ) and b(e3 ) transition probabilities connecting them . at this point",
    "it has to be pointed out that in the present framework where only time reversal invariant wave functions are considered it is only possible to describe excited states with average angular momentum zero . to deal with genuine @xmath0 or @xmath6states cranking model wave functions",
    "should be considered , which is out of the scope of the present work . here",
    "we will assume that the cranking rotational energy of the @xmath0state is much smaller than the excitation energy of the negative parity band head and therefore can be safely neglected .",
    "also the impact of the cranking term in the transition probabilities to be discussed next is neglected . with these approximation in mind ,",
    "the reduced transition probabilities from the lowest @xmath0 and @xmath6 states to the @xmath7 ground state can be computed within the rotational model approximation as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are correlated wave functions obtained in the spirit of the gcm from the collective wave functions @xmath37 .",
    "the preceding formula can be reduced to an expression involving those collective wave functions @xmath37 by means of the goa @xcite .",
    "the final result for @xmath46 bands reads @xmath47 for the e1 electric transition and @xmath48 for the e3 one . in the preceding formulas we have introduced the collective matrix element of an operator @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 . in eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) @xmath52 is the dipole moment operator whose mean value is defined as the difference between the center of mass of protons and neutrons @xmath53 finally , @xmath54 is the part of the octupole operator acting on proton s space .    to carry out the collective calculations it is necessary to specify the collective parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath36 appearing in the definition of @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ hcoll ] ) .",
    "as it was said before , there are two sets of parameters coming from the gcm+goa and the atdhf derivation of the collective hamiltonian .",
    "the set of parameters used in this calculation is an admixture of the two and it is known as the atdhf+zpe set .",
    "it includes the mass parameter @xmath32 coming out from the semi - classical hamiltonian of the atdhf theory , the metric of the gcm+goa and the zpe correction computed with the gcm+goa formula but using the atdhf mass instead , i.e. @xmath56 this set of parameters was devised to put together the advantages of the atdhf set ( time - odd components included in the mass term ) and the ones of the gcm+goa ( zpe correction ) .",
    "this method can be somewhat justified in the context of the extended gcm @xcite and has been extensively used @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the collective parameters involves the inversion of the hfb stability matrix which is closely related to the matrix of the rpa equation . at present , this is a formidable task and approximations are needed .",
    "the approximation used in this article  called  cranking approximation @xcite  neglects the off - diagonal terms of the stability matrix allowing to invert it analytically but at the cost of including the two body interaction only through the mean field .",
    "although this approximation has been extensively used in the literature for the calculation of collective masses and moments of inertia ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) its validity has not been properly established . using the `` cranking approximation '' ,",
    "the atdhf+zpe parameters are given by @xmath57 where the quantities @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) are defined as @xmath60 in the preceding expression , @xmath61 are the quasi - particle energies and @xmath62 are the matrix elements of the @xmath63 part @xcite of the octupole operator @xmath64 in the quasi - particle basis of the hfb wave function @xmath65 .",
    "this form of the collective mass is usually referred to in the literature as belyaev - inglis mass @xcite .",
    "in the subsequent subsections the results obtained with the bcp1 @xcite functional and regarding octupole properties of some radium and barium isotopes will be discussed .",
    "the other functional defined in @xcite and referred to as bcp2 will not be explicitly considered here although the calculations were carried out for that case too .",
    "the reason is the strong similarities between bcp1 and bcp2 results that produced most of the curves one on top of another , making it impossible to differenciate them in the plots presented .",
    "octupole deformation properties of the radium isotopes were the first to be addressed from a microscopic point of view with the gogny force , first at the mean field level @xcite and next including exact restoration of the parity symmetry @xcite . at the mean field level ,",
    "the first quantity to analyze is the potential energy curve ( pec ) as a function of the octupole moment that determines both the ground state minimum and its stiffness .",
    "let us point out that for every point in the pec the other multipole moments ( quadrupole , hexadecapole , etc ) are selfconsistently determined as to produce the lowest energy .",
    "the pecs computed with the bcp1 @xcite energy density functional and the gogny d1s @xcite force are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpes_ra ] . as can be seen in the plot",
    ", the results for the two types of interactions look very similar in all the nuclei considered .",
    "it is observed how , whenever a minimum appears ( in the nuclei from @xmath66ra to @xmath67ra ) in the gogny d1s calculation at an octupole deformation different from zero , the same happens and at the same @xmath33 value in the bcp1 calculation .",
    "for the nuclei with the minimum at @xmath68 the gogny d1s force shows a tendency to produce a stiffer parabolic behavior in the pec than in bcp1 .",
    "the depth of the octupole deformed minima is also very similar for both kinds of calculations and reaches its maximum value of 1.5 mev for the nucleus @xmath69ra which therefore can be considered as the strongest octupole deformed nuclei of the considered chain .",
    "( in units of @xmath70 ) for the isotopes of radium ( z=88 ) from a=216 up to a=232 .",
    "results for both the bcp1 energy density functional ( full curves ) and the gogny d1s force ( dotted curves ) are shown.[fig : mfpes_ra ] ]     is plotted as a function of the octupole moment @xmath33 ( in units of @xmath70 ) for the radium isotopes considered .",
    "dotted lines correspond to the pp correlation energies whereas full lines are meant to represent the same quantity for protons .",
    "thick lines are used to depict the results of the calculations with the bcp1 functional whereas thin lines are for the results with the gogny d1s force.[fig : pairing_ra ] ]    in fig [ fig : pairing_ra ] we show the particle - particle correlation energy defined as @xmath71 and given in terms of the usual pairing field @xmath72 and pairing tensor @xmath73 of the hfb method .",
    "this quantity gives a rough idea of the amount of pairing correlations in the system .",
    "it can also be used as an indicator of the size of the single particle level density around the fermi surface as strong pairing correlations are direct consequence of high level densities .",
    "this energy is also correlated with the pairing gap that represents the energy of the lowest two quasi - particle excitation and therefore it is closely related to the collective inertias to be discussed below",
    ". the overall tendency of @xmath74 is to decrease with increasing octupole moment up to values of @xmath75 b@xmath76which correspond to typical excitation energies of 5 - 6 mev above the ground state in the pecs .",
    "from there on we observe , depending on the nucleus , stationary behaviors or mild increases .",
    "we also notice that the @xmath74 computed with bcp1 are greater than the ones computed with d1s for the light isotopes @xmath18ra and @xmath66ra and for the two species of nucleons . for the nucleus",
    "@xmath77ra the particle - particle correlation energies for protons and neutrons are similar in both calculations and from there on and up to the @xmath78ra isotope the d1s correlation energies are larger than the bcp1 ones . for the heaviest isotope considered @xmath19ra",
    "the @xmath74 energy for neutrons is larger for bcp1 than for d1s and the opposite is true for protons .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : spe224ra ] the single particle energies ( spe ) are plotted as a function of the octupole moment @xmath33 for both protons and neutrons .",
    "results of both calculations are shown in different panels ( gogny d1s upper and bcp1 lower panels ) .",
    "in all the cases , the fermi level is represented by a thick dotted line .",
    "once the stretching effect of the bigger effective mass of bcp1 ( 1 , versus 0.7 in gogny d1s ) is accounted for , the similitude between the single particle energies obtained with gogny d1s and bcp1 around the fermi level and @xmath33 values in the neighborhood of the mean field minimum is remarkable .",
    "it is also possible to say that the behavior of most of the levels as a function of both @xmath79 and @xmath33 is quite similar in both kinds of calculations .",
    "this is so in spite of the different ordering of the spherical orbitals : for protons the @xmath13 and @xmath80 are reversed in the spectrum of gogny d1s as compared to the spectrum of bcp1 . for neutrons",
    "there is also such an inversion between the @xmath10 orbital and the @xmath81 orbital and also the separation between the @xmath81 and @xmath11 orbitals is much larger in bcp1 than in gogny d1s .",
    "that the single particle spectrum looks similar in the region of well developed quadrupole deformation and also as a function of octupole deformation is probably a consequence of the collective character of those collective degrees of freedom where the geometry of the shape of the nucleus is more important than quantum mechanical effects . to make the argument more quantitative ,",
    "we have analyzed the structure of the single particle wave functions in terms of nilsson quantum numbers and found that the levels around the fermi surface have similar structures .",
    "a typical example for protons is the @xmath82 level that for @xmath83 lies at -4.5 mev in the d1s case and at -4.2 mev in the bcp one .",
    "this level originates in the @xmath80 spherical orbital in the d1s case whereas it comes from a @xmath13 in the bcp one .",

    "we can also consider another example in the neutron side where , at @xmath83 there is a @xmath90 orbital at around -5 mev that originates from a @xmath12 spherical level in the d1s calculations and from a @xmath15 in the bcp one .",

    "we conclude that the quantitative structure of the levels is quite similar in the two calculations irrespective of their spherical origin .",
    "this reinforces our suggestion about the fundamental role played by the collective degrees of freedom in the determination of single particle wave functions .",
    "the conditions for the development of octupolarity are clearly satisfied in this nucleus as can be seen in the single particle plot : for protons there are `` @xmath13 '' levels below the fermi level with @xmath96 and 3/2 and at the same time @xmath12 orbitals with @xmath96 and @xmath97 are just above the fermi level . the same happens in the neutron case with the @xmath11 orbital well below the fermi level and the @xmath10 with @xmath96 and 3/2 at the fermi level ( please remember the super - fluid character of neutrons that makes the fermi level concept a diffuse one ) .",
    "another condition for the development of a minimum is the presence of a region of low level density in the spe spectrum ( jahn - teller effect , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion in the nuclear context ) .",
    "we observe in the two proton spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spe224ra ] how the fermi level of protons lies in the middle of a low level density region at @xmath98 b@xmath76 which corresponds to the position of the minimum . for neutrons and around @xmath98b@xmath76 we also observe a region of low level density near the fermi level which is more pronounced for the bcp1 results . as the number of neutrons is increased the fermi level moves upward and enters a region of high level density that is unable to lead to a deformed minimum as is the case for @xmath78ra and heavier isotopes .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the differences observed in the position of the single particle levels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spe224ra ] has little impact on the quantum numbers of neighboring odd - a nuclei as in the present mean field framework those quantum numbers have to be obtained after a selfconsistent blocking mean field procedure and it is not enough to block the single particle orbitals of fig .",

    "( [ eq : collm ] ) and ( [ eq : mn ] ) ) and playing a central role in the collective schrdinger hamiltonian of the previous section . as a consequence of the presence in its definition of a denominator with powers of the two quasiparticle energies @xmath99 , the collective inertia is roughly speaking inversely proportional to the amount of pairing correlations ( the pairing gap to be more quantitative ) and directly proportional to the effective mass of the interaction .",
    "the lower pairing correlations present in bcp1 are not able to compensate for the higher effective mass and as a consequence the bcp1 inertias are higher than the gogny d1s ones . thus the energies obtained as a solution of the one dimensional collective hamiltonian , which are roughly speaking proportional to the inverse of the square root of the collective mass ( remember the standard harmonic oscillator formula relating the oscillator s frequency @xmath100 with the spring constant and the mass @xmath101 ) , are expected to reach lower values for bcp1 than for d1s .",

    "a more robust indicator of the quality of the results is the reproduction of the isotopic trend which is very good in both , d1s and bcp1 , calculations . concerning the @xmath5 transition probabilities we observe a pronounced minimum around @xmath110 in the two calculations that is a direct consequence of the behavior of the dipole moment as a function of the octupole moment for different isotopes .",

    "we observe how the isotopic trend is reasonably well reproduced although the absolute values of the energies are typically a factor of two larger than the experimental values .",
    "the bcp1 excitation energies are closer to the ones from gogny d1s than in the radium isotopes calculations . as discussed previously , the values of the energies strongly depend upon the values of the collective mass in the vicinity of the minimum as well as on the height and width of the barrier separating the two minima with opposite octupole deformation .",

    "the bcp1 values for the @xmath1 transition probabilities are systematically smaller than the gogny d1s ones by almost one order of magnitude . as in the case of the excitation energies of the @xmath0 states , it has to be stressed that the isotopic trend is consistent in the two sets of calculations and both nicely reproduced the scarce experimental data @xcite . finally , in the right hand side panel of fig .",

    ", the energy roughly corresponds to the dominant coulomb repulsion between the two incipient fragments .",
    "we observe how the results obtained with bcp and gogny d1s are fairly similar with the position of the ground state minimum and the fission isomer lying at roughly the same @xmath79 values .",
    "the potential energy curves obtained with the bcp1 and bcp2 functionals are very similar and are hardly distinguishable in fig . [ fig:240pu_fission ] .",
    "the fission isomer obtained with gogny d1s lies at an excitation energy almost 2 mev higher than the one obtained with the bcp functionals .",
    "it is also observed that the first and second fission barrier heights obtained with the gogny d1s force are higher than the ones obtained from the bcp functionals .",
    "this is very likely a consequence of the surface coefficient in semi - infinite nuclear matter that is higher in gogny d1s than in the bcp functionals ( see the values quoted in @xcite ) . at this point and taking into account the differences in the pecs it can be concluded that the predictions for the spontaneous fission half lives obtained with the bcp functionals and gogny d1s force are going to be higher for gogny d1s than for bcp .",
    "however , a definitive answer to this question can not be given until the effect of triaxiality has been incorporated into the calculations because it is well known that triaxiality can have a strong impact in the first barrier height .",
    "also , it has to be kept in mind that the collective mass along the @xmath79 collective degree of freedom , and entering the wkb formula used to estimate fission half lives , can be substantially different when computed with the bcp functionals or the gogny d1s force .",
    "therefore , the detailed discussion of the fission half lives obtained with the bcp functionals is deferred to a more detailed study of fission properties obtained with this class of functionals . in this paper , devoted to octupole deformation , it is enough to confirm that the shapes of the nucleus in its way down to fission are essentially the same irrespective of the functional / interaction used as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",

    "[ fig:240pu_fission ] through the half density contours ) is the same irrespective of the interaction / functional used in the calculation and therefore the predictions of the fission fragment mass distributions obtained at the mean field level with gogny d1s force and bcp functionals should coincide .",
    "we have explored the octupole degree of freedom in two sets of isotopes with the newly postulated bcp functionals .",
    "the agreement found with both experiment and the benchmark results obtained in the same framework with the gogny d1s interaction , gives us confidence on the good properties of the bcp functionals concerning odd parity multipole moments .",
    "in addition , the matter distribution of the fissioning nucleus @xmath3pu , which strongly depend upon the response of the system to octupole perturbations , is found to be essentially the same in the three calculations performed implying thereby that the bcp functionals and the gogny d1s force are equally well suited in that respect .",
