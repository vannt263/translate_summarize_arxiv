    "turbulence is a common phenomenon in astrophysical fluids ( see , for example , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) and it is obvious that most astrophysical fluids are permeated by magnetic fields ( brandenburg & subramanian 2005 ) .",
    "such magnetized fluids can be investigated by numerical simulations of driven magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ( e.g. biskamp 2003 ) .    to maintain turbulence in fluids",
    ", energy must be injected into the fluids .",
    "many turbulence simulations have been performed with either solenoidal ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath110 ) or compressive ( @xmath8@xmath12@xmath10@xmath110 ) forcing ( e.g. , meneguzzi , frisch , & pouquet 1981 ; cho & vishniac 2000 ; brandenburg 2001 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ; federrath et al .",
    "most of these studies have adopted energy injection on a single scale in fourier space ( wavenumber space ) . however , multiple driving scales should be considered in simulations in order to better imitate real astrophysical fluids , such as the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the intracluster medium ( icm ) , because multiple astrophysical driving mechanisms may act on different scales simultaneously in those systems .",
    "there are many possible energy sources for ism turbulence .",
    "mac low ( 2004 ) examined available driving mechanisms for turbulence in the ism .",
    "magnetorotational instabilities , gravitational instabilities , protostellar outflows , expansion of h ii regions , stellar winds from massive stars , and supernova explosions have been considered as candidates for energy sources of ism turbulence .",
    "haverkorn et al .",
    "( 2008 ) observed faraday rotation of extragalatic radio sources through the galactic plane and determined the outer scale of turbulence in the galactic ism .",
    "they suggested that stellar sources , such as stellar winds and protostellar outflows , drive turbulence on parsec scales in the spiral arms and supernova and superbubble explosions on @xmath13100 parsec scales in the interarm regions .",
    "han et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed the large - scale magnetic energy spectrum in our galaxy and suggested that ism turbulence is driven by stellar winds and supernova explosions on scales from 10 parsecs to 100 parsecs .",
    "it is also clear that the icm is in a turbulent state with multiple driving scales .",
    "schuecker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtained a pressure map of the coma cluster using xmm - newton data and derived properties of turbulence from the map . according to their result ,",
    "the largest eddy size and the smallest eddy size in the central region of the cluster are 145 kpc and 20 kpc , respectively .",
    "many possible driving mechanisms exist for icm turbulence .",
    "first , there are mechanisms that can provide energy injection on large scales . for example , cosmological shocks ( ryu et al . 2003 ; pfrommer et al .",
    "2006 ) or mergers ( de young 1992 ; tribble 1993 ; norman & bryan 1999 ; roettiger et al .",
    "1999 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) can produce turbulence in which the outer scale is similar to the size of the entire cluster .",
    "in fact , the outer scale of turbulence observed in some simulations during the formation of galaxy clusters is up to @xmath13 several hundred kpc ( norman & bryan 1999 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) , which is a few times smaller than the cluster size of @xmath13mpc .",
    "second , there are also mechanisms that can provide energy injection on small scales . for example , infall of small structures ( takizawa 2005 ) , agn jets ( see , for example , scannapieco & brggen 2008 ) , or galaxy wakes ( roland 1981 ; bregman & david 1989 ; kim 2007 ) can produce turbulence in which the outer scale is much smaller than the size of a cluster .",
    "due to variety of turbulence driving scales in the ism and the icm , it is necessary to inject energy on several different scales to simulate turbulence in those systems .",
    "however , there has been no rigorous research in this direction . in this paper",
    ", we study mhd turbulence driven at two scales .",
    "we mainly focus on the behavior of kinetic , magnetic , and density spectra in the presence of the driving at two scales .",
    "the outline of this study is as follows .",
    "we start by explaining numerical methods , initial conditions and forcing used for this work in section 2 .",
    "theoretical expectations are given in section 3 .",
    "then , results for incompressible mhd turbulence are shown in section 4 .",
    "results for compressible mhd turbulence , especially density , rotation measure ( rm ) , and velocity centroid ( vc ) spectra , are provided in section 5 .",
    "we discuss astrophysical implications in section 6 and give summary in section 7 .",
    "we use both incompressible and compressible mhd codes .",
    "the incompressible mhd code is based on the pseudospectral method and the compressible code is based on an essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) scheme .",
    "we directly solve the incompressible mhd equations in a periodic box of size 2@xmath14 using a pseudospectral code :    @xmath15    where @xmath8@xmath9@xmath16=@xmath8@xmath9@xmath17@xmath110 and @xmath18=@xmath19+@xmath20/2 . here",

    "the magnetic field consists of a uniform background field @xmath24 and a fluctuating field @xmath25 .    in this work ,",
    "we drive turbulence in fourier space and consider only solenoidal ( @xmath26 ) forcing .",
    "we use 22 large - scale forcing components with 2 @xmath0k@xmath0@xmath1 and 100 small - scale forcing components with 15 @xmath2k@xmath2 26 , where @xmath27 is the wavenumber .",
    "therefore , peaks of energy injections occur at k @xmath13 2 ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) and at k @xmath13 20 ( @xmath28 @xmath30 ) .",
    "the 22 large - scale forcing components are nearly isotropically distributed in the range 2 @xmath0k@xmath0@xmath1 in fourier space .",
    "the wavenumbers used are 2 ( three components ) , @xmath31 ( 12 components ) , 3 ( three components ) , and @xmath32 ( four components ) .",
    "the amplitude of each large - scale forcing component fluctuates randomly . on average ,",
    "the amplitude of each component is same .",
    "therefore , the average large - scale driving wavenumber will be @xmath33 . however , since our kinetic spectra clearly show a peak at k=2 in the presence of large - scale driving , we assume that the peak of large - scale energy injection occurs at k@xmath132 .",
    "if we take @xmath34 , the coefficient on the right - hand side in equation ( [ eq : theo_exp ] ) will be @xmath35 .",
    "for the small - scale driving , we randomly selected 100 fourier modes in the range @xmath36 . on average",
    "the amplitude of each small - scale forcing mode is same .",
    "incompressible turbulence simulations are performed on a spatial grid of @xmath37 points .",

    "we consider only cases where the viscosity is equal to the magnetic diffusivity : @xmath39 .",
