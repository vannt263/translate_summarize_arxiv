    "in recent years , the rapid increase in both the availability of data on networks ( of all kinds , but especially social ones ) and the demand , from many scientific areas , for analyzing such data has resulted in a surge of generative and descriptive models for network data @xcite . within statistics ,",
    "this trend has led to a renewed interest in developing , analyzing and validating statistical models for networks @xcite . yet as networks are a nonstandard type of data , many basic properties of statistical models for networks are still unknown or have not been properly explored .    in this article",
    "we investigate the conditions under which statistical inferences drawn over a sub - network will generalize to the entire network .",
    "it is quite rare for the data to ever actually be the _ whole _ network of relations among a given set of nodes or units ; typically , only a sub - network is available .",
    "guided by experience of more conventional problems like regression , analysts have generally fit models to the available sub - network , and then extrapolated them to the larger true network which is of actual scientific interest , presuming that the models are , as it were , consistent under sampling .",
    "what we show is that this is only valid for very special model specifications , and the specifications where it is _ not _ valid include some of which are currently among the most popular and scientifically appealing .    in particular , we restrict ourselves to exponential random graph models ( ergms ) , undoubtedly one of the most important and popular classes of statistical models of network structure .",
    "in addition to the general works already cited , the reader is referred to @xcite for detailed accounts of these models .",
    "there are many reasons ergms are so prominent .",
    "on the one hand , ergms , as the name suggests , are exponential families , and so they inherit all the familiar virtues of exponential families in general : they are analytically and inferentially convenient @xcite ; they naturally arise from considerations of maximum entropy  @xcite and minimum description length  @xcite , and from physically - motivated large deviations principles @xcite ; and if a generative model obeys reasonable - seeming regularity conditions while still having a finite - dimensional sufficient statistic , it must be an exponential family @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ergms have particular virtues as models of networks .",
    "the sufficient statistics in these models typically count the number or density of certain `` motifs '' or small sub - graphs , such as edges themselves , triangles , @xmath0-cliques , stars , etc .",
    "these in turn are plausibly related to different network - growth mechanisms , giving them a substantive interpretation ; see , for example ,  @xcite as an exemplary application of this idea , or , more briefly , section  [ secergms ] below .",
    "moreover , the important task of edge prediction is easily handled in this framework , reducing to a conditional logistic regression @xcite . since the development of ( comparatively ) computationally - efficient maximum - likelihood estimators ( based on monte carlo sampling ) , ergms have emerged as flexible and persuasive tools for modeling network data  @xcite .",
    "despite all these strengths , however , ergms are tools with a serious weakness .",
    "as we mentioned , it is very rare to ever observe the whole network of interest . the usual procedure , then , is to fit ergms ( by maximum likelihood or pseudo - likelihood ) to the observed sub - network , and then extrapolate the same model , with the same parameters , to the whole network ; often this takes the form of interpreting the parameters as `` provid[ing ] information about the presence of structural effects observed in the network ''  @xcite , page  194 , or the strength of different network - formation mechanisms ; @xcite are just a few of the more recent papers doing this .",
    "this obviously raises the question of the statistical ( i.e. , large sample ) consistency of maximum likelihood estimation in this context .",
    "unnoticed , however , is the logically prior question of whether it is _ probabilistically _ consistent to apply the same ergm , with the same parameters , both to the whole network and its sub - networks .",
    "that is , whether the marginal distribution of a sub - network will be consistent with the distribution of the whole network , for all possible values of the model parameters .",
    "the same question arises when parameters are compared across networks of different sizes ( as in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when this form of consistency fails , then the parameter estimates obtained from a sub - network may not provide reliable estimates of , or may not even be relatable to , the parameters of the whole network , rendering the task of statistical inference based on a sub - network ill - posed .",
    "we formalize this question using the notion of `` projective families '' from the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "we say that a model is _ projective _ when the same parameters can be used for both the whole network and any of its sub - networks . in this article , we fully characterize projectibility of discrete exponential families and , as corollary , show that ergms are projective only for very special choices of the sufficient statistic .    _",
    "outline_. our results are not specific just to networks , but pertain more generally with exponential families of stochastic processes . in section  [ secprojectiblity - and - exp - fam ] , therefore , we lay out the necessary background about projective families of distributions , projective parameters and exponential families in a somewhat more abstract setting than that of networks . in section [ secprojectibility - and - independent - increments ]",
    "we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for an exponential family to be projective is that the sufficient statistics obey a kind of additive decomposition .",
    "this in turn implies strong independence properties .",
    "we also prove results about the consistency of maximum likelihood parameter estimation under these conditions ( section  [ secconsistency - of - mle ] ) . in section [ secergms ] , we apply these results to ergms , showing that most popular specifications for social networks and other stochastic graphs can not be projective .",
    "we then conclude with some discussion on possible constructive responses .",
    "the proofs are contained in the .    _ related work_. an early recognition of the fact that sub - networks may have statistical properties which differ radically from those of the whole network came in the context of studying networks with power - law ( `` scale - free '' ) degree distributions . on the one hand ,",
    "stumpf , wiuf and may @xcite showed that `` subnets of scale - free networks are not scale - free ; '' on the other , achlioptas et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a particular , highly popular sampling scheme creates the appearance of a power - law degree distribution on nearly any network .",
    "while the importance of network sampling schemes has been recognized since then  @xcite , chapter 5 , and valuable contributions have come from , for example , @xcite , we are not aware of any work which has addressed the specific issue of consistency under projection which we tackle here . perhaps the closest approaches to our perspective are  @xcite and @xcite . the former considers conditions under which infinite - dimensional families of distributions on abstract spaces have projective limits .",
    "the latter , more concretely , addresses the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators for exponential families of dependent variables , but under assumptions ( regarding markov properties , the `` shape '' of neighborhoods , and decay of correlations in potential functions ) which are basically incomparable in strength to ours.=-1",
    "our results about exponential random graph models are actually special cases of more general results about exponential families of dependent random variables , and are just as easy to state and prove in the general context as for graphs . setting this up",
    ", however , requires some preliminary definitions and notation , which make precise the idea of `` seeing more data from the same source . '' in order to dispense with any measurability issues , we will implicitly assume the existence of an underlying probability measure for which the random variables under study are all measurable . furthermore , for the sake of readability we will not rely on the measure theoretic notion of filtration : though technically appropriate , it will add nothing to our results .",
    "let @xmath1 be a collection of finite subsets of a denumerable set @xmath2 partially ordered with respect to subset inclusion . for technical reasons",
    ", we will further assume that @xmath3 has the property of being an ideal : that is , if @xmath4 belongs to @xmath3 , then all subsets of @xmath4 are also in @xmath3 and if @xmath4 , and @xmath5 belongs to @xmath3 , then so does their union .",
    "we may think of passing from @xmath6 to @xmath7 as taking increasingly large samples from a population , or recording increasingly long time series , or mapping data from increasing large spatial regions , or over an increasingly dense spatial grid , or looking at larger and larger sub - graphs from a single network .",
    "accordingly , we consider the associated collection of parametric statistical models @xmath8 indexed by @xmath1 , where , for each @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a family of probability distributions indexed by points @xmath11 in a fixed open set @xmath12",
    ". the probability distributions in @xmath13 are also assumed to be supported over the same @xmath14 , which are countable sets for each @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the partial order of @xmath1 is isomorphic to the partial order over @xmath15 , in the sense that @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17 .    for given @xmath11 and @xmath6 , we denote with @xmath18 the random variable distributed as @xmath19 . in particular , for a given @xmath20 , we can regard the @xmath21 as finite - dimensional ( i.e. , marginal ) distributions .",
    "for each pair @xmath22 in @xmath1 with @xmath23 , we let @xmath24 be the natural index projection given by @xmath25 . in the context of networks",
    ", we may think of @xmath26 as the set of nodes of a possibly infinite random graph , which without loss of generality can be taken to be @xmath27 and of @xmath3 as the collection of all finite subsets of @xmath26 .",
    "then , for some positive integers @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we may , for instance , take @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that @xmath18 will be the induced sub - graph on the first @xmath28 nodes and @xmath32 the induced sub - graph on the first @xmath33 nodes .",
    "the projection @xmath34 then just picks out the appropriate sub - graph from the larger graph ; see figure [ figprojective - structure - illustrated ] for a schematic example .",
    "we will be concerned with a natural form of probabilistic consistency of the collection @xmath35 which we call _ projectibility _ , defined below .",
    "is contained in the larger set of observables @xmath36 , @xmath18 ( on the right ) can be recovered from @xmath37 ( on the left ) through the projection @xmath34 , which simply drops the extra data . ]",
    "the family @xmath38 is _ projective _ if , for any @xmath6 and @xmath5 in @xmath3 with @xmath39 , @xmath40    see  @xcite , page 115 , for more general treatment of projectibility . in words , @xmath41 is a projective family when @xmath39 implies that @xmath42 can be recovered by marginalization over @xmath43 , for all @xmath11 . within a projective family , @xmath44 denotes the infinite - dimensional distribution , which thus exists by the kolmogorov extension theorem  @xcite , theorem 6.16 , page 115 .",
    "projectibility is automatic when the generative model calls for independent and identically distributed ( iid ) observations .",
    "it is also generally unproblematic when the model is specified in terms of _ conditional _ distributions : one then just uses the ionescu tulcea extension theorem in place of that of kolmogorov  @xcite , theorem  6.17 , page  116 .",
    "however , many models are specified in terms of _ joint",
    "_ distributions for various index sets , and this , as we show in theorem [ thmprojectible - iff - separable ] , can rule out projectibility .    we restrict ourselves to _ exponential family _",

    "fix @xmath59 such that @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath60 , and we will sometimes write this function @xmath61 , where the first argument is in @xmath14 and the second in @xmath62 . we will have frequent recourse to the increment to the sufficient statistic , @xmath63 .",
    "the volume factor @xmath64 is defined as before , but we shall also consider , for each observable value @xmath56 of the sufficient statistics for @xmath4 and increment @xmath65 of the sufficient statistics from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , the _ joint volume factor , _",
    "@xmath66 and the _ conditional volume factor , _ @xmath67 as we will see , these volume factors play a key role in characterizing projectibility .",
    "in this section we characterize projectibility in terms of the increments of the vector of sufficient statistics .",
    "in particular we show that exponential families are projective if , and only if , their sufficient statistics decompose into separate additive contributions from disjoint observations in a particularly nice way which we formalize in the following definition .",
    "the sufficient statistics of the family @xmath35 have _ separable increments _ when , for each @xmath23 , @xmath68 , the range of possible increments @xmath65 is the same for all @xmath69 , and the conditional volume factor is constant in @xmath69 , that is , @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noting that the property of having separable increments is an intrinsic property of the family @xmath8 that depends only on the functional forms of the sufficient statistics @xmath71 and not on the model parameters @xmath45 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , for any @xmath4 , the probability distributions @xmath72 have identical support @xmath73 .",
    "thus , this property holds for all of @xmath11 or none of them .",

    "interestingly , independent increments for the statistic are necessary but not quite sufficient for projectibility .",
    "these claims are all made more specific in the propositions which follow .",
    "we first show that projectibility implies that the sufficient statistics have independent increments .",
    "in fact , a stronger results holds , namely that the increments of the sufficient statistics are independent of the actual sequence .",
    "below we will write @xmath76 to signify @xmath77 .",

    "as we will see , this test covers many statistical models for networks .",
    "it is natural to inquire into the converse to these propositions .",

    "this can not be a projective family .",
    "( this can also be checked by a direct and straightforward , if even more tedious , calculation . )",
    "we conclude this section with a final observation .",
    "butler , in @xcite , showed that when observations follow from an iid model with a minimal sufficient statistic , the predictive distribution for the next observation can be written entirely in terms of how different hypothetical values would change the sufficient statistic ; cf .",

    ", they apply to exponential families of time series , where @xmath2 is the natural or real number line ( or perhaps just its positive part ) , and the elements of @xmath1 are intervals .",

    "if @xmath11 is to be re - scaled in a way that is a function of @xmath6 alone , we can recover the case of a fixed @xmath11 by `` moving the scaling across the inner product , '' that is , by re - defining @xmath52 to incorporate the scaling . with a sample - invariant @xmath11 ,",
    "it is this transformed @xmath90 which must have separable increments .",
    "other transformations can either be dealt with similarly , or amount to using a nonuniform base measure ; see below .",
    "_ statistical - mechanical interpretation_. it is interesting to consider the interpretation of our theorem , and of its proof , in terms of statistical mechanics . as is well known , the `` canonical '' distributions in statistical mechanics are exponential families ( boltzmann  gibbs distributions ) , where the sufficient statistics are `` extensive '' physical observables , such as energy , volume , the number of molecules of various species , etc . , and the natural parameters are the corresponding conjugate `` intensive '' variables , such as , respectively , ( inverse ) temperature , pressure , chemical potential , etc .",
    "equilibrium between two systems , which interact by exchanging the variables tracked by the extensive variables , is obtained if and only if they have the same values of the intensive parameters  @xcite",
    ". in our terms , of course , this is simply projectibility , the requirement that the same parameters hold for all sub - systems .",
    "what we have shown is that for this to be true , the increments to the extensive variables must be completely unpredictable from their values on the sub - system .",
    "furthermore , notice the important role played in both halves of the proof by the separation of the joint volume factor , @xmath108 . in terms of statistical mechanics ,",
    "a macroscopic state is a collection of microscopic configurations with the same value of one or more macroscopic observables .",
    "the boltzmann entropy of a macroscopic state is ( proportional to ) the logarithm of the volume of those microscopic states  @xcite .",
    "if we define our macroscopic states through the sufficient statistics , then their boltzmann entropy is just @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the separation of the volume factor is the same as the additivity of the entropy across different parts of the system , that is , the entropy is `` extensive . ''",
    "our results may thus be relevant to debates in statistical mechanics about the appropriateness of alternative , nonextensive entropies ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "_ beyond exponential families_. it is not clear just how important it is that we have an exponential family , as opposed to a family admitting a finite - dimensional sufficient statistic .",
    "as is well known , the two concepts coincide under some regularity conditions @xcite , but not quite strictly , and it would be interesting to know whether or not the exponential form of equation ( [ eqnexponential - family - density ] ) is strictly required .",
    "we have attempted to write the proofs in a way which minimizes the use of this form ( in favor of the neyman factorization , which only uses sufficiency ) , but have not succeeded in eliminating it completely .",

    "prediction_. we have focused on the implications of projectibility for parametric inference .",
    "exponential families are , however , often used in statistics and machine learning as generative models in applications where the only goal is prediction  @xcite , and so ( to quote butler  @xcite ) `` all parameters are nuisance parameters . '' but even in then , it must be possible to consistently extend the generative model s distribution for the training data to a joint distribution for training and testing data , with a single set of parameters shared by both old and new data . while this requirement may seem too trivial to mention , it is , precisely , projectibility .    _ growing number of parameters_. in the proof of theorem [ thmprojectible - iff - separable ] , we used the fact that @xmath52 , and hence @xmath11 , has the same dimension for all @xmath110 .",

    "asymptotic scaling of the log partition function implies @xmath120 is consistent .",
    "as mentioned in the , our general results about projective structure in exponential families arose from questions about exponential random graph models of networks . to make the application clear",
    ", we must fill in some details regarding ergms .",
    "given a group of @xmath28 nodes , the network among them is represented by the binary @xmath164 _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath165 , where @xmath166 if there is a tie from @xmath167 to @xmath168 and is 0 otherwise .",

    ", each dyad s configuration is independent of every other dyad s ( conditional on @xmath134 ) . in an ergm ,",
    "dyadic independence is equivalent to the ( vector - valued ) statistic @xmath90 adding up over dyads , @xmath173 that is , the statistic can be written as a sum of terms over the information available for each dyad .",
    "in particular , in _ block models _",
    "@xcite , @xmath170 is categorical , giving the type of node @xmath167 , and the vector of sufficient statistics counts dyad configurations among pairs of nodes of given pairs of types .",
    "dyadic independence implies projectibility : since all dyads have independent configurations , each dyad makes a separate additive contribution to @xmath90 .",

    "@xmath90 thus has separable increments , implying projectibility by theorem [ thmprojectible - iff - separable ] .",
    "( adding a new node adds only edges between the old nodes and the new , without disturbing the old counts . )",
    "as the distribution factorizes into a product of @xmath175 terms , each of exactly the same form , the log partition function scales exactly with @xmath175 , and the conclusions of section  [ secconsistency - of - mle ] imply the strong consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "thus hold , and these models are projective . ]",
    "this result thus applies to the well - studied @xmath176-model @xcite .",
    "typically , however , ergms are _ not _ dyadic independence models . in many networks , if nodes @xmath167 and @xmath168 are both linked to @xmath0 , then @xmath167 and @xmath168 are unusually likely to be directly linked .",
    "this will of course happen if nodes of the same type are especially likely to be friends ( `` homophily '' @xcite ) , since then the posterior probability of @xmath167 and @xmath168 being of the same type is elevated .",
    "however , it can also be modeled directly .",
    "the direct way to do so is to introduce the number ( or density ) of triangles as a sufficient statistic , but this leads to pathological degeneracy @xcite , and modern specifications involve a large set of triangle - like motifs @xcite .",
    "empirically , when using such specifications , one often finds a nontrivial coefficient for such `` transitivity '' or `` clustering , '' over and above homophily  @xcite .",
    "it is because of such findings that we ask whether the parameters in these models are projective .",
    "sadly , no statistic which counts triangles , or larger motifs , can have the nice additive form of dyad counts , no matter how we decompose the network .",
    "take , for instance , triangles .",
    "any given edge among the first @xmath28 nodes _ could _ be part of a triangle , depending on ties to the next node . thus to determine the number of triangles among the first @xmath177 nodes , we need much more information about the sub - graph of the first @xmath28 nodes than just the number of triangles among them .",
    "indeed , we can go further .",
    "the range of possible increments to the number of triangles changes with the number of existing triangles .",
    "this is quite incompatible with separable increments , so , by ( [ thmprojectible - iff - separable ] ) , the parameters can not be projective .",
    "we remark that the nonprojectibility of markov graphs @xcite , a special instance of ergms where the sufficient statistics count edges , @xmath0-stars and triangles , was noted in @xcite .",
    "parallel arguments apply to the count of any motif of @xmath0 nodes , @xmath178 .",
    "any given edge ( or absence of an edge ) among the first @xmath28 nodes could be part of such a motif , depending on the edges involving the next @xmath179 nodes .",
    "such counts are thus not nicely additive .",
    "for the same reasons as with triangles , the range of increments for such statistics is not constant , and nonseparable increments imply nonprojective family .",
    "while these ergms are not projective , some of them may , as a sort of consolation prize , still satisfy equation ( [ eqnasymptotic - scaling ] ) .",
    "for instance , in models where @xmath90 has two elements , the number of edges and the ( normalized ) number of triangles or of 2-stars , the log partition function is known to scale like @xmath175 as the number of nodes @xmath180 , at least in the parameter regimes where the models behave basically like either very full or very empty erds ",
    "rnyi networks @xcite .",
    "( we suspect , from @xcite , that similar results apply to many other ergms . )",
    "thus , by equation ( [ eqnldp - for - suff - stat ] ) , if we fix a large number @xmath28 of nodes and generate a graph @xmath165 from @xmath181 , the probability that the mle @xmath182 will be more than @xmath183 away from @xmath11 will be exponentially small in @xmath175 and @xmath184 .",
    "since these models are not projective , however , it is impossible to _ improve _ parameter estimates by getting more data , since parameters for smaller sub - graphs just can not be extrapolated to larger graphs ( or vice versa ) .",
    "we thus have a near - dichotomy for ergms .",
    "dyadic independence models have separable and independent increments to the statistics , and the resulting family is projective .",
    "however , specifications where the sufficient statistics count larger motifs can not have separable increments , and projectibility does not hold .",
    "such an ergm may provide a good description of a given social network on a certain set of nodes , but it can not be projected to give predictions on any larger or more global graph from which that one was drawn . if an ergm is postulated for the whole network , then inference for its parameters must explicitly treat the unobserved portions of the network as missing data ( perhaps through an expectation - maximization algorithm ) , though of course there may be considerable uncertainty about just how much data is missing .",
    "specifications for exponential families of dependent variables in terms of joint distributions are surprisingly delicate ; the statistics must be chosen extremely carefully , in order to achieve separable increments .",
    "( conditional specifications do not have this problem . )",
    "this has , perhaps , been obscured in the past by the emphasis on using exponential families to model multivariate but independent cases , as iid models are always projective .",
    "network models , one of the outstanding applications of exponential families , suffer from this problem in an acute form .",
    "dyadic independence models are projective models , but are sociologically extremely implausible , and certainly do not manage to reproduce the data well .",
    "more interesting specifications , involving clustering terms , never have separable increments .",
    "we thus have an impasse which it seems can only be resolved by going to a different family of specifications .",
    "one possibility  which , however , requires more and different data  is to model the evolution of networks over time  @xcite . in particular , hanneke , fu and xing  @xcite",
    "consider situations where the distribution of the network at time @xmath185 conditional on the network at time @xmath56 follows an exponential family .",
    "even when the statistics in the conditional specification include ( say ) changes in the number of triangles , the issues raised above do not apply .    roughly speaking ,",
    "the issue with the nonprojective ergm specifications , and with other nonprojective exponential families , is that the dependency structure corresponding to the statistics allows interactions between arbitrary collections of random variables .",
    "it is not possible , with those statistics , to `` screen off '' one part of the assemblage from another by conditioning on boundary terms .",
    "suppose our larger information set @xmath36 consists of two nonoverlapping and strictly smaller information sets , @xmath39 and @xmath186 , plus the new observation obtained by looking at both @xmath6 and @xmath187 .",
    "( for instance , the latter might be the edges between two disjoint sets of nodes . )",
    "then the models which work properly are ones where the sufficient statistic for @xmath36 partitions into marginal terms from @xmath6 and @xmath187 , plus the interactions strictly between them : @xmath188 . in physical language",
    "@xcite , the energy for the whole assemblage needs to be a sum of two `` volume '' terms for its sub - assemblages , plus a `` surface '' term for their interface .",
    "the network models with nonprojective parameters do not admit such a decomposition ; every variable , potentially , interacts with every other variable .    one might try to give up the exponential family form , while keeping finite - dimensional sufficient statistics .",
    "we suspect that this will not work , however , since lauritzen  @xcite showed that whenever the sufficient statistics form a semi - group , the models must be either ordinary exponential families , or certain generalizations thereof with much the same properties .",
    "we believe that there exists a purely algebraic characterization of the sufficient statistics compatible with projectibility , but must leave this for the future .",
    "one reason for the trouble with ergms is that every infinite exchangeable graph distribution is actually a mixture over projective dyadic - independence distributions  @xcite , though not necessarily ones with a finite - dimensional sufficient statistic . along any one sequence of sub - graphs from such an infinite graph , in fact , the densities of all motifs approach limiting values which pick out a unique projective dyadic - independence distribution  @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "this suggests that an alternative to parametric inference would be nonparametric estimation of the limiting dyadic - independence model , by smoothing the adjacency matrix ; this , too , we pursue elsewhere .",
    "for notation in this section , without loss of generality , fix a generic pair of subsets @xmath23 and a value of @xmath11 .",
    "we will write a representative point @xmath189 as @xmath190 , with @xmath119 and @xmath191 . also , we abbreviate @xmath192 , for @xmath119 and @xmath191 by @xmath193 .      for clarity ,",
    "we prove the two directions separately .",
    "first we show that projectability implies separable increments .",
    "if the exponential family @xmath194 is projective , then the sufficient statistics @xmath195 have separable increments , that is , @xmath23 implies that @xmath70 .",
