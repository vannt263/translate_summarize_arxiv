    "the presence of massive stars within starbursts undoubtedly plays a huge role in determining the physical conditions within the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "high - mass ( m@xmath1 @xmath2 8m@xmath3 ) stars formed within typical starbursts drastically affect the dynamics of the surrounding ism , through not only the release of ionizing photons which destroy molecular material , but also via supernovae ( sne ) which provide thermal and kinetic energy input into the ism .",
    "the effects of photoionization by high - mass stars on the observed dearth of pahs have recently been investigated @xcite , while in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , we examined a sample of 18 galaxies of varying metallicity ( from 1/50th to super solar ) with high star formation rates in order to determine whether supernova - driven shocks do indeed play a role in the pah deficit in low metallicity environments .",
    "if we consider the ratio of the 26 @xmath0 m [ feii ] line and the 12.8 @xmath0 m [ neii ] line as a tracer of the strength of supernova shocks , we found a strong anti - correlation suggesting that strong supernova - driven shocks are indeed present within low metallicity galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the pah deficit within these objects may indeed be linked to the presence and strength of these shocks . however , it has not as yet been conclusively proved that shocks are the dominant process behind the pah deficit .",
    "as already noted , photoionization and perhaps delayed injection of dust into the ism @xcite each make their own contributions to the pah deficit , but as yet , it remains unclear as to which of these three processes is the most dominant .",
    "additionally , is the relationship between the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio and the pah emission , as indicated in paper i , really probing a causal effect ?",
    "it could very well be that this relationship may be coincidental , or that physical or selection effects may be the primary drivers for the observed relationship .",
    "it would therefore be advisable to further explore the nature of the ism within such star - forming environments using additional mid - ir probes in order to expand upon our understanding of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio , and by extension , its relationship with key ism indicators such as pah strength and metallicity .",
    "to accomplish this , we have expanded our sample from the 18 objects presented in paper i by including archival irs observations of 23 additional objects , bringing the sample total to 41 .",
    "the full list of targets is given in table 1 , and listed by increasing metallicity .",
    "these galaxies range in metallicity from extremely low ( such as i zw 18 , with @xmath4= 1/50 ) to super - solar metallicity ( @xmath5 ) galaxies such as ngc 7714 .",
    "to differentiate between low and high - metallicity galaxies , we use a metallicity ( 12 + log [ o / h ] ) cut - off value of 8.85 - just less than solar , as per paper i. the galaxies range widely in morphology from blue compact dwarfs such as i zw 18 to spirals such as ngc 7714 and ic 342 .",
    "none of the galaxies in our sample are known to harbour agns .",
    "this is important , as pah destruction can occur close to an agn due to the hard ionization environment ( e.g. sturm et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition [ feii ] emission can be elevated in galaxies harbouring agn .",
    "one possible exception is ngc 7714 , which is optically classified as a liner @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of [ nev ] emission at 14 and 24 @xmath0 m and the absence of any evidence for an obscured agn by recent chandra imaging @xcite strongly suggests that ngc 7714 is a pure starburst and it is therefore included in our sample .",
    "we extracted low and high resolution archival spectral data from the short - low ( sl ) ( 5.2 - 14.5 @xmath0 m ) , short - high ( sh ) ( 9.9 - 19.6 @xmath0 m ) and long - high ( lh ) ( 18.7 - 37.2 @xmath0 m ) modules of the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "the datasets were derived from a number of _ spitzer _ legacy , go and gto programs released to the _ spitzer _ data archive , and consisted of either spectral mapping or staring observations .",
    "we obtained fluxes for the nuclear positions only from the mapping observations .",
    "all the staring observations were centered on the galaxy s nucleus .",
    "the data were preprocessed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) data reduction pipeline version 15.3 before being downloaded .",
    "further processing was done within the irs bcd - level data reduction package _ spice _ , v 2.0.1 .",
    "both the low and high resolution spectra were extracted by _",
    "spice _ using the full - aperture extraction method .",
    "as the [ siii ] emission is extended beyond the extent of the high resolution slits in particular , we applied the alcf and slcf extended source corrections to the spectra as part of the _ spice _ extraction .",
    "the slit for the sh and lh modules is too small for background subtraction to take place and separate sh or lh background observations do not exist for any of the galaxies in this sample . for the sl module , background subtraction was done using either a designated background file when available or by subtracting the data from one nod position from the other along the slit . in some cases ,",
    "the slit was enveloped in the host galaxy and background subtraction could not take place .",
    "for both high and low resolution spectra , the ends of each order where the noise increases significantly were manually clipped , as were hot pixels .    for the high resolution observations ,",
    "we required matched extractions in terms of angular extent from both the sh & lh slits , in order to accurately derive densities based upon the 18 and 33 @xmath0 m [ siii ] lines .",
    "the ionization potential of [ siii ] is @xmath635 ev , with the [ siii ] emission arising from gas ionized by young stars for our sample . with a relatively low ionization potential , [ siii ] emission",
    "may be quite easily extended in spatial extent beyond the nuclear single - slit pointings for sh and lh .",
    "indeed , comparisons of iso and irs data @xcite show [ siii ] emission within star - forming agn that extends beyond the size of both the sh and lh slits . given that [ siii ] emission is extended and we would expect to see a higher flux in the larger lh slit , any derived [ siii ] line ratio will be artificially depressed . to avoid such aperture effects between the sh and lh slits",
    ", we scaled the lh flux by multiplying it by the ratio of the sh / lh slit angular sizes .    as a number of the sample starbursts at high metallicity",
    "are known to be dusty systems with large obscuration , the extracted line fluxes were then corrected for extinction for the sample as a whole .",
    "the fluxes and statistical errors , plus the derived line ratios , are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively , obtained using the idl - based analysis package _",
    ", v.6.2.6 @xcite . in all cases detections",
    "were defined when the line flux was at least 3@xmath7 .",
    "for the sl , sh and lh modules the spectral resolution was @xmath8/@xmath9 60 - 127 and @xmath6600 respectively , with fwhm in the order of 1.9 x 10@xmath10 @xmath0 m for the pah feature in the low - res spectrum , and 2 - 4 x 10@xmath11 @xmath0 m for the fine structure lines in the high resolution spectra .",
    "for the absolute photometric flux uncertainty we conservatively adopt 15% , based on the assessed values given by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) over the lifetime of the mission .",
    "this error is calculated from multiple observations of various standard stars throughout the spitzer mission by the ssc .",
    "the dominant component of the total error arises from the uncertainty at mid - ir wavelengths in the stellar models used in calibration and is systematic rather than gaussian in nature .",
    "the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah strength was determined according to the prescription adopted in a number of previous studies @xcite .",
    "while the 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath0 m pah lines are stronger , the 8.6 @xmath0 m line can suffer extinction effects due to a potential silicate absorption feature at 9 @xmath0 m , and both of these pose difficulties in determining the continuum level .",
    "for this work , the continuum was determined at the center of the 6.2 @xmath0 m feature , using a first order linear fit to the 5.5 and 11.5 @xmath0 m bandpass .",
    "the pah strength was then calculated as the ratio of the 6.2 @xmath0 m feature peak intensity to the underlying continuum .",
    "we assume a gaussian fit while fitting the pah and fine structure lines with _",
    "in fig 1 , we plot [ feii]/[neii ] vs the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah peak to continuum ratio to check if the relationship between the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio and the pah peak to continuum strength first noted in paper i , using the 6.2 @xmath0 m pah feature instead of the 7.7 @xmath0 m , as one can perform continuum fitting with a higher degree of confidence with the 6.2 @xmath0 m feature , still holds for the expanded sample , as noted above . employing a spearman rank correlation analysis @xcite to assess the statistical significance of this trend yields a correlation coefficient of r@xmath12 of -0.705 and p@xmath12 of 2.69 x 10@xmath13 , confirming the significant anti - correlation between pah strength and the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio as seen in paper i. the spearman rank correlation technique has the advantage of being non - parametric",
    ", robust to outliers and does not presuppose a linear relation .",
    "we plot the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio versus the metallicity in fig.2 , and we again see a strong anti - correlation ( r@xmath12 of -0.777 and p@xmath12 of 9.36 x 10@xmath14 ) between [ feii]/[neii ] and metallicity as seen in paper i.    based upon what we have already seen from paper i and from figs .  1 and 2 , if the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio is truly indicative of the strength of supernova - driven shocks within the extent of the high resolution slits , one would expect the passage of such shocks to affect conditions within the local ism in quite a substantive manner .",
    "shocks , in addition to removing dust and pah from the ism @xcite , should also be adept in removing gas - one would therefore expect the propagation of intense sne - driven shocks into the ism of star forming regions to greatly impact on the density of the gas . in order to determine how the gas density within these nuclear star forming regions corresponds with the strength of the supernova - driven shocks , we require a reliable mid - ir tracer to probe the gas density . the [ siii ] 18.7/33.4 @xmath0 m line ratio provides such a reliable mid - ir tracer of the gas density ,",
    "as it is ideal for probing gas ( with high critical densities ) in the regions surrounding starbursts , especially as the [ siii ] lines are starburst dominated @xcite .",
    "this ratio is sensitive to changes in the density for the 50 @xmath15 n@xmath16 @xmath15 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , but is insensitive to changes in temperature @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the logarithm of the ratio of the [ siii ] fluxes versus the [ feii]/[neii ] flux ratio .",
    "there is a strikingly strong trend between the two line ratios , with high [ feii]/[neii ] values corresponding to lower [ siii ] ratios . using the spearman rank correlation analysis , we get ( r@xmath12 ) of -0.891 between the [ siii ] ratio and the [ feii]/[neii ] with a probability of chance correlation ( p@xmath12 ) of 7.43 x 10@xmath19 , indicating a significant anti - correlation .",
    "interestingly , we see a general decrease in the metallicity of the object with lower [ siii ] ratios , corresponding to higher [ feii]/[neii ] .    we again plot the logarithm of the ratio of the [ siii ] fluxes in fig . 4 , but this time against the 6.2 micron pah peak / continuum ratio . as with fig .",
    "3 , we see a strong trend , but this time with the pah strength increasing with log [ siii ] - the pah strength is increasing with higher gas density . again running a spearman rank correlation analysis ,",
    "we get r@xmath12 of 0.750 and p@xmath12 of 9.64 x 10@xmath14 , confirming a significant correlation between log [ siii ] and pah strength .",
    "we again see that a general trend exists with pah strength increasing with metallicity and increasing values of log [ siii ] .",
    "as we have seen from figs . 1 - 4 , a series of relationships would seem to exist between the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio , the metallicity , the pah strength and the [ siii ] ratio , with low values of the [ siii ] ratio corresponding with high [ feii]/[neii ] ratios and weak / no pah emission .",
    "however , before we press ahead with more detailed investigations of the nature of these relationships , it is prudent to first check whether other factors , such as extinction and aperture effects might be responsible .",
    "as we have noted previously in section 2 , we corrected the irs fluxes for extinction , with a@xmath20 ranging from @xmath6 2 to 30 mag . to determine the correction",
    ", we used the ratios of @xmath21 and @xmath22 where available from the literature .",
    "emissivity coefficients from @xcite for case b recombination with an electron temperature of 10@xmath17 k and density of @xmath23 were used to calculate the intrinsic line ratios for the h recombination lines .",
    "we note that while the density used in these calculations is lower than that seen in some of our sample , we noted little change in the intrinsic line ratios for denser environments .",
    "we adopted a @xcite extinction law above 8.5 @xmath0 m , and the @xcite galactic extinction law below this point .",
    "as the observed relationships remain post correction , we conclude that extinction can be ruled out as a driver for the observed correlations .",
    "for the optical [ sii ] lines used lines used as comparisons to the _ mappings _ output , we obtained and used from the literature extinction corrected fluxes where available .",
    "as noted earlier , the ionization potential of [ siii ] is @xmath635 ev , with the [ siii ] emission arising from gas ionized by young stars . with a relatively low ionization potential , [ siii ] emission",
    "may be quite easily extended in spatial extent beyond the nuclear single - slit pointings for sh and lh . to compensate",
    ", we applied the slcf and alcf extended source corrections to the spectra .",
    "additionally , as we are looking to derive a physical quantity , namely the gas density , over a similarly sized physical area given the extent of the [ siii ] emission , it is therefore crucial that we use [ siii ] fluxes derived from slits of equal angular size .",
    "to do this , we obtained a fraction of the lh full slit flux by multiplying it by the sh / lh angular size ratio , as noted in section 2 .",
    "the final , corrected fluxes are given in table 1 .",
    "since we can rule out extinction and aperture effects as drivers for the observed correlations , we can be confident that the correlations seen in figs .",
    "1 - 4 are indeed true physical relationships between the strength of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio and a number of ism indicators , with the primary culprit for the observed relationships being the passage of sne - driven shocks . however , while we have focussed up to now with a supernova - derived shock origin for the behaviour of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio , it may not be the only explanation .",
    "for example , @xcite note sign of strong depletion of iron onto dust grains , and gradual destruction of those grains on a time scale of a few myr , based on a survey of metal - poor galaxies from the 3rd release of the sdss .",
    "such a process could undoubtedly drastically affect the nature of fe emission , and by extension the behaviour of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio , within our sample - we may instead be probing an abundance - driven relationship and the other observed relationships presented here would be purely coincidental to the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio . in order to explore if this indeed is the true cause or if shocks alone can explain the observed relationships , we used shock and standard  - pdr models in an effort to model the observed [ feii]/[neii ] relationship for a wide variety of environments .",
    "we used both the _ mappings iii _",
    "photoionization / shock code @xcite and the cloudy photoionization code @xcite in order to determine the relative proportions to the [ feii ] emission from shocks and /pdrs , and by extension , the driving process behind the behaviour of the observed [ feii]/[neii ] line ratio .",
    "in addition to the mid - ir output , we also wished to explore if a similar relationship is present at optical wavelengths .",
    "to this end , we use the ratio of extinction corrected [ sii ] fluxes at 6716 and 6731    taken from the literature and compared the observed ratios with the _ mappings _ output .      in an effort to quantify the true nature of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio ,",
    "we initially constructed a number of _ mappings _ models where density , metallicity and luminosity were allowed to vary .",
    "the theoretical  region models were generated by the _",
    "mappings iii _ code , which uses as input the euv fields predicted by the stellar population synthesis models _",
    "starburst99 _ @xcite .",
    "the photoionization modeling and shock models carried out with _ mappings iii _ for this analysis are described in @xcite and @xcite , and are described briefly here . to model",
    "the  region spectrum , _ mappings _ assumes the metallicity and the shape of the euv spectrum are defined ( through the _ starburst99 _ input ) , and characterizes the local ionization state by a local ionization parameter :    @xmath24    where _ s _ is the ionizing photon flux through a unit area , _",
    "n _ is the local number density of hydrogen atoms and _ q _ is the maximum velocity of an ionization front that can be driven by the local radiation field @xcite .",
    "we used a 5 myr continuous star - formation sed from _",

    "the parameters of the sed consisted of a saltpeter imf with a power law of 2.35 and a star - formation rate of 1 @xmath25 yr@xmath10 .",
    "we then constructed a series of plane parallel , isobaric models with _",
    "p / k _ = 10@xmath26 @xmath18 k , where either the gas density , metallicity or the luminosity for the _ starburst99 _ input were allowed to vary , with the other two variable remaining constant . for the _ starburst99 _",

    "elemental abundances for 0.5 - 2.0__z@xmath3 _ _ were adopted for the variable metallicity models , while for the variable density and luminosity models , 0.4__z@xmath3 _ _ metallicity abundances were used .",
    "dust physics is treated explicitly through absorption , grain charging and photoelectric heating and the use of a standard mrn grain size distribution for both carbonaceous and silicaceous grain types @xcite .",
    "the _ mappings _ code took the undepleted solar abundances to be those of @xcite . for non - solar metallicities ,",
    "_ mappings _ assumes that both the dust model and the depletion factors are unchanged .",
    "all elements except nitrogen and helium are taken to be primary nucleosynthesis elements .",
    "as for the shock models , we use the pre - run shock models from the _ mappings _ website , which are based upon a grid of _ n _ = 1.0 models with _ v _",
    "= 100 - 1000 km / s in steps of 25 km / s . the magnetic parameter _",
    "b = p/@xmath31 _ is fixed to 3 in all calculations .",
    "this value corresponds to equipartition between thermal and magnetic pressures @xcite .    from the _ mappings _ output from the variable metallicity model",
    ", we saw that whilst the [ siii ] and [ sii ] values remain relatively constant ( and by extension , the density ) , the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio varies quite considerably . with the variable density model , interestingly",
    ", we saw that [ feii]/[neii ] does not drop with increasing density contrary to what we observe ( fig .",
    "3 ) , but rather slightly increases , contrary to what we observe . finally , for the variable luminosity model , both the [ feii]/[neii ] and unsurprisingly the [ siii ] and [ sii ] values , remained constant . from the _ mappings _ model data",
    ", it would seem that the change in metallicity is primarily responsible for the observed drop in the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio . in order to directly compare the photoionization and shock model output with the irs and optical data , we then set about defining models that would replicate the sort of density , metallicity and luminosity parameters typically seen in the sample .",
    "since the low metallicity objects tend to have lower densities and luminosities , we generated _ mappings _ models that gradually increased the metallicity , density and luminosity , over the ranges outlined above , moving from low to high metallicity ( 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.4 and solar metallicity ) , low to high density ( 20 - 1000 @xmath32 and low to high luminosity ( 10@xmath33 to 10@xmath34 ergs ) .",
    "as we increased the metallicity , we concurrently moved to high densities and higher luminosities .",

    "we do not include turbulent pressure in the equation of state , although we assume a small turbulent broadening of 1 km s@xmath10 for its effects on line optical depths .",
    "such an equation of state neglects shocks or other time - dependent effects . in the constant pressure scenario",
    ", we specify _ _ n__@xmath41 at the illuminated face , then solve for density based how the pressure contributions change with depth .",
    "our densities range over log[__n__@xmath41 ] = 2 to 4 , in increments of 0.5 dex .",
    "overall , our combination of _ _ n__@xmath41 and _ z _ represent 52 calculations .    in fig .",
    "6 , we plot the [ feii]/[neii ] line ratio as a function of @xmath56 and density for the  region only . in fig .",
    "7 , we again plot the [ feii]/[neii ] line ratio as a function of @xmath56 and density , but this time including the pdr in addition to the  region .",
    "as one can see , the relative  contribution dominates over the pdr contribution at low densities ( and metallicities ) , with the pdr contribution becoming more dominant as one moves to higher densities ( @xmath6 10@xmath57 @xmath18 ) and metallicities .",
    "previous ir studies of starburst /pdr regions @xcite support this scenario .",
    "for very dense  regions where the pdrs are irradiated by intense fuv , and thus pdr - derived [ feii ] emission is dominant .",
    "correspondingly at lower densities ( @xmath610@xmath58 @xmath18 ) , the  regions are larger , the pdrs lie further from the stars , and the resultant lowered fuv fluxes and densities do not excite [ feii ] in the pdr , and thus the  region dominates the /pdr contribution to [ feii ] production for such environments .      from the @xmath36 and @xmath59 simulations and the comparisons with the irs and optical data ( fig .",
    "5 ) , it would seem that metallicity is the primary driver for the behaviour of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio , as metallicity determines the origin ( shocks vs  and/or pdrs ) and strength of the [ feii ] emission .",
    "we can reproduce the observed [ feii]/[neii ] dependence on _ z _ if we assume the izotov variation of _ fe / ne _ with _ z_. cloudy reproduces the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio decrease with increases in density ( for the pure h ii region only ) because of the following : the critical density for electron excitation of [ fe ii ] is 1.2 x 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , while for [ ne ii ] it is 5 x 10@xmath26 @xmath18 .",
    "the ratio of [ fe ii]/[neii ] thus depends on the ratio :    @xmath60    in the low density limit , this ratio is @xmath642 .",
    "however , for a density of 1 x 10@xmath17 @xmath18 , which is the high end of our parameter space , this ratio is only @xmath620 because [ fe ii ] emission is suppressed by the higher density .",
    "the reason the ratio increases with density in fig . 7 ( + pdr ) is because [ fe ii ] is excited by atomic hydrogen in the pdr in addition to electrons in the  region .",
    "the critical density of [ fe ii ] with h atoms is @xmath61 x 10@xmath61 @xmath18 .",
    "therefore [ fe ii ] emits readily in the pdr , while [ ne ii ] does not emit because all the neon is neutral .",
    "however , we do note that the  and pdr contribution to the [ feii ] emission is surpassed by the contribution from shocks at the lowest metallicities and densities , based on comparison with the _ mappings _ output and the observed data - perhaps only @xmath610% of the [ feii ] emission comes from  and pdrs with that contribution rising to @xmath680 - 90% as one moves to higher metallicity .",
    "as we move to roughly solar metallicity , it would seem likely that the dominant mechanism for production of [ feii ] ( and thus the behaviour of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio at high metallicities ) is from  and pdrs in combination rather than from sne shocks .      while abundances may play a role in the overall behavior of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio",
    ", the shock scenario would seem to fit the observed variation of the gas density and the pah ratio with metallicity . assuming that shocks are indeed behind the observed correlations",
    ", the following scenarios would seem to account for the relationship between the [ feii]/[neii ] and [ siii ] ratios and the pah strength .",
    "in very low metallicity dwarf starburst environments , such as i zw 18 , the observed gas density is phenomenally low , in the order of @xmath620 - 100 @xmath18 . from fig . 3 and the models",
    ", it would seem that low density correlates strongly with the presence of strong supernovae shocks , a harsh radiation environment which is lacking in populations of dust and pah , as noted by the lack of pah emission ( figs . 1 and 4 ) and generally flat slopes of the dust continua .",
    "it would seem likely therefore that we are probing the tenuous gas within a superbubble cavity that has been carved by the cumulative effects of numerous supernova - driven shocks .",
    "previous surveys of low metallicity dwarf galaxies have found evidence for such superbubbles @xcite , with ionized gas expanding at a rate of several tens of km / s driven by mechanical energy from starbursts deposited into the ism @xcite .    for high metallicity environments ,",
    "the picture becomes somewhat more complicated .",
    "such objects are of course still the sites of high levels of massive star formation - the high metallicity starburst m82 is after all the template for starburst activity - but we see a much more benign environment for the survivability of dust and pah .",
    "a number of new factors play a role in affecting star formation and its effects on the local environment .",
    "first of all , from the cloudy and _ mappings _ models plus the observed data , we note that the dominant contribution to the [ feii ] flux no longer comes from shocks , but rather from  regions and from pdrs in particular - the lack of shocks propagating into the ism provides a more benign , denser environment for the build - up of dust and pah .",
    "superbubbles are present as in low metallicity galaxies , however supernova - driven shocks are no longer the dominant mechanism driving the expansion but rather stellar winds from massive stars . as a consequence ,",
    "less mechanical energy is available to drive breakout and outflow and the superbubble can remain enclosed , especially where the gravitational potential of the galaxy is steep @xcite .",
    "given the inability of weaker shocks to drive out material and clear the local ism , it is not surprising that we should see a buildup of metals , and the survivability of dust and pah formed locally .",
    "whilst the sne - driven shock hypothesis is convincing in terms of the enhanced [ feii ] emission and corresponding low pah emission , it is the not the only plausible explanation for the observed correlation . as we have already noted , from @xcite it has been suggested that the observed levels of [ feii ] emission may instead be abundance driven . using equations 1 & 2 to derive how the _ fe / ne _ ratio varies with metallicity , we see that the _ fe / ne _ ratio decreases with increasing _ z _ in a fashion very similar to the [ feii]/[neii ] vs.  _ z _ correlation , suggesting that the variation in the [ feii]/[neii ] emission ratio with _ z _ may be a consequence of varying _ fe / ne _ abundance with _",
    "z_. indeed , the slope of _ fe / ne _ vs. _ z _ from @xcite is very similar to the slope of the best fitting line from fig 2 ( m = -0.68 ) - our observational dataset points to this being a possibility , and the _ mappings _ and cloudy models further lend support to this scenario .",
    "however given the similarity in terms of behaviour of our observational dataset with the @xcite results , it begs the question - what may be causing the change in _ fe / ne _ with _ z _ ?",
    "since neon is not depleted @xcite , the observed relationship would then be due to variations in _",
    "fe_/_h _ rather than _",
    "ne_/_h_. so what is causing the iron depletion ?",
    "since iron is known to be depleted onto grains @xcite , the increased variation in _ fe_/_h _ would suggest that there is either more grain destruction , or less grain formation , as one moves to lower metallicities .",
    "if this is correct , the reason for the observed [ feii]/[neii ] with _ z _ trend is that fe is less depleted in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "this would have a profound impact on ism studies , as the usefulness of iron emission as a pure indicator of shocks may be compromised .",
    "however , this is not conclusive , and we need more observations to deduce for certain the physical process which is controlling the [ feii ] emission . in order to definitively figure out",
    "if shocks are truly responsible for the [ feii ] emission at low metallicity , we require high resolution ir spectroscopy to unambiguously determine the presence of shocks within the velocity profiles .",
    "the upcoming availability of such high resolution spectroscopic data from _ herschel _ and _ sofia _ will be crucial to determine the true nature of iron emission at low metallicity and we look forward to furthering this line of investigation in a future paper .",
    "using archival _ spitzer _ observations of 41 starburst galaxies that span a wide range in metallicity , we found a correlation between the ratio of emission line fluxes of [ feii ] at 26 @xmath0 m and [ neii ] at 12.8 @xmath0 m and the electron gas density as traced by the 18.7/33.4 @xmath0 m [ siii ] ratio , with the [ feii]/[neii ] flux ratio decreasing with increasing gas density .",
    "we also find a strong correlation between the gas density and the pah peak to continuum strength .",
    "the correlation of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio and the pah peak to continuum strength found in @xcite was confirmed for a larger sample . using shock and photoionization models",
    ", we see that metallicity is the primary driver for the observed behaviour of the [ feii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "it may very well be that the majority of [ feii ] emission at low metallicity may be shock - derived , whilst at high metallicity , the [ feii ] emission is dominated by contributions from  and in particular , from pdr regions , and that at higher metallicity shocks may not play as significant a role in removing gas , pah and dust from the ism , unlike in low metallicity systems .",
    "however , the observed [ feii]/[neii ] emission may instead be following a metallicity - abundance relationship , with the iron being less depleted in low metallicity galaxies , a result that would have profound implications for the use of fe emission lines as unambiguous tracers of shocks .",
    "follow up high resolution spectroscopic observations will be required to determine if this is indeed the case , or if the detected iron emission is truly tracing emission from the passage of shocks .",
