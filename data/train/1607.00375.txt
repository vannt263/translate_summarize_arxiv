    "one of the more unexpected results obtained from the heterodyne instrument for the infrared ( hifi ) on board the _ herschel space observatory _ has been the discovery of interstellar argonium ions ( arh@xmath0 ) , the first known astrophysical molecule to contain a noble gas atom.detected early in the _ herschel _ mission as a ubiquitous interstellar absorption feature of unknown origin at 617.5  ghz ( mller et al .",
    "2013 ) , the @xmath5 transition of arh@xmath0 was finally identified by barlow et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , following its detection , in emission , from the crab nebula , along with a second transition ( the @xmath6 transition ) at twice the frequency .",
    "while the _ herschel _ detections of argonium were all obtained within the galaxy , an extragalactic detection has been reported recently ( mller et al .",
    "2015 ) , within the @xmath7 galaxy along the sight - line to pks 1830 - 211 .    as discussed by schilke et al .",
    "( 2014 ; hereafter s14 ) , several  accidents \" of chemistry conspire to permit the presence of interstellar argonium at observable abundances : arh@xmath0 has an unusually slow rate of dissociative recombination with electrons ( mitchell et al .",
    "2005 ) and an unusually small photodissociation cross - section for radiation longward of the lyman limit ( alekseyev et al .",
    "moreover , while other abundant noble gas cations ( he@xmath0 and ne@xmath0 ) undergo an exothermic dissociative ionization reaction when they react with with h@xmath8 , e.g. @xmath9 the analogous reaction is endothermic in the case of ar@xmath0 and thus the alternative argonium - producing abstraction reaction is favored : @xmath10 these unusual features of the relevant chemistry also suggested that argonium ions can serve as a unique tracer of gas in which the h@xmath8 fraction is extremely small ; indeed , the theoretical predictions of our diffuse cloud model ( s14 ) indicated that the argonium abundance peaks very close to cloud surfaces where the molecular hydrogen fraction , @xmath11 is only @xmath12 to @xmath13 .    in this paper , we present a general parameter study of argonium in diffuse clouds that extends the results we presented previously in s14 . in the present study , we computed the argonium column densities expected as a function of several relevant parameters : the gas density , the uv radiation field , the cosmic - ray ionization rate ( crir ) , and the visual extinction across the cloud .",
    "our model is described in  2 , and the results are presented in  3 , together with analogous results for oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 . in  4 , we discuss the results and describe how observations of all three molecular ions can be used to constrain the molecular fraction and cosmic ray ionization rate in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "our thermal and chemical model for diffuse molecular clouds is based upon the model described by hollenbach et al .",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter h12 ) , with the chemistry of argon - containing species added as described by s14 .",
    "we adopted a two - sided slab model , of total assumed optical depth @xmath14 , in which the radiation field in free space , @xmath15 , is isotropically incident with a value of @xmath15/2 on each side . here",
    ", the uv interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , @xmath15 , is normalized with respect to the average field given by draine ( 1978 ) , and assumed to have the same spectral shape as that field .",
    "the attenuation of the isotropic field was calculated as described in wolfire et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and the equilibrium gas temperature and steady - state chemical abundances were calculated as a function of depth into the cloud .",
    "we adopted gas - phase abundances , relative to h nuclei , of @xmath16 for carbon nuclei ( sofia et al .",
    "2004 ; gerin et al .",
    "2015 ) and @xmath17 for oxygen nuclei ( cartledge et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "as described below , several collisional excitation rates , heating rates , and chemical rates have been modified relative to the h12 model . for collisional excitation of c@xmath0 by h@xmath8 and by h , we adopted rate coefficients from wiesenfeld & goldsmith ( 2014 ) and from barinovs et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , respectively . for collisional excitation of atomic o by h",
    ", we adopted the rates from abrahamsson et al .",
    "we have corrected a minor error that resulted in far - uv radiation being double - counted in the computation of the heating rate due to photodetachment of pah@xmath18 .",
    "changes to the chemistry include the addition of a @xmath19c chemical network , following burton et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and the inclusion of cosmic - ray induced photoionization of c , using the umist rate ( mcelroy et al .",
    "2013 ) weighted by the molecular h@xmath8 fraction . for the reaction of h@xmath20 with o , we adopted the rate coefficients of de ruette et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , and considered the product channels to oh@xmath0 + h@xmath8 and to @xmath1 + h. we took the binding energies of o and oh on grain surfaces , @xmath21 , to be 1800 k , and 4800 k respectively ( he et al .",
    "we adopted an hcl@xmath0 dissociative recombination rate from novotny et al .",
    "we also included the photodissociation of hcl@xmath0 and cf@xmath0 .",
    "for hcl@xmath0 we adopted an unshielded rate of @xmath22 ( http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/@xmath23ewine/photo/ ) , with a depth - dependence proportional to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an exponential integral , the same as that adopted for oh@xmath0 . for cf@xmath0 , we assumed an unshielded rate of @xmath26 , with a depth - dependence the same as that for hcl , viz .",
    "@xmath27      in the case of argon - containing species , we adopt the same network of chemical reactions that we presented in s14 , with the adopted rates exactly as listed in table 2 of that paper . ) : the products should have been given as arh@xmath0 and h. ] a complete discussion will not be given here , but the broad features may be described as follows .",
    "the reaction network is initiated by the ionization of argon atoms by cosmic rays , and the resultant ions react rapidly with h@xmath8 to form arh@xmath0 ( reaction r2 in  1 above).when @xmath28 , recombination of ar@xmath0 with electrons and pah anions competes with arh@xmath0 formation , but otherwise every ionization of ar is followed by the formation of argonium .",
    "argonium , which has a proton affinity of only 369 kj  mol@xmath29 , is destroyed by proton transfer to neutral species , including o , co and , most importantly , h@xmath8 .",
    "photodissociation is potentially important as an additional destruction mechanism in regions of enhanced uv field .      in s14",
    ", we obtained predictions for the arh@xmath0 abundance and column density for a single value of the gas density , uv radiation field , and crir .",
    "in the present study , we have constructed a large grid of diffuse cloud models , and thereby investigated the dependence of the arh@xmath0 column density on relevant physical parameters . in principle , there are key four parameters in the model that affect the arh@xmath0 column density : 0.1 true in ( 1 ) the isrf , @xmath15 , 0.1 true in ( 2 ) the crir , @xmath30 expressed as the primary ionization rate for atomic hydrogen .",
    "the total ionization rate for atomic hydrogen is roughly a factor of 1.5 as large as @xmath31 , and the total ionization rate for h@xmath8 is roughly @xmath32 ( glassgold & langer 1973 ) , the exact factors depending upon the fractional ionization and treated in our model using results given by ( dalgarno et al .",
    "1999 ) , 0.1 true in ( 3 ) the total visual extinction through the cloud , @xmath33 ; and 0.1 true in ( 4 ) the gas density , @xmath34 , given as the volume density of h nuclei and assumed constant within the cloud ; 0.1 true in however , provided the gas densities are small enough that the total cooling rate is unaffected by collisional de - excitation , the molecular column densities depend only upon three combinations of these four parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath33 .",
    "this behavior occurs because all bimolecular reactions and collisional cooling processes have rates ( per unit volume ) @xmath37 , while all protoprocesses ( e.g.  photoionization , photodissociation , photoelectric heating ) have rates that scale as @xmath38 and all cosmic - ray induced processes ( e.g.  cosmic - ray ionization , cosmic - ray heating ) have rates @xmath39 in this regime , therefore , we only needed to explore a three - dimensional parameter space consisting of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    with the exception mentioned in  2.5 below , all the calculations presented here were carried out for @xmath44 , a typical value in the cold neutral medium .",
    "our standard grid comprises a total of 784 diffuse clouds models run for 8 values of @xmath40 in the range 0.2 to 10 , 7 values of @xmath41 in the range @xmath45 to 6 @xmath46 and 14 values of @xmath33 in the range @xmath47 to 3 .",
    "moreover , all the results presented below were obtained for  steady - state \" models , computed under the assumption that the cloud parameters vary over timescales that are much longer than that needed to reach chemical equilibrium .",
    "recent simulations of diffuse clouds , presented by valdivia et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , suggest that the h@xmath8 fraction may show departures from equilibrium in low - density regions .",
    "because the ion - neutral reactions leading to oh@xmath0 , @xmath1 and arh@xmath0 are much faster than the grain - surface reactions that produce h@xmath8 , we expect these molecular ions to show abundances appropriate to the h@xmath8 fraction , even if the h@xmath8 fraction has not itself reached equilibrium .",
    "we constructed a second complete grid of models to examine the dependence of the results on the adopted heavy - element abundances . here , we considered the case where all the heavy - element and dust abundances are increased by a factor 2 .",
    "this set of models was motivated by the presence of abundance gradients within the galactic disk , and the fact that _ herschel _ observations of molecular ions can probe the inner galaxy as well as the solar neighborhood .",
    "we also ran an additional model for a much lower density applicable to the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , @xmath48 . here , we were motivated by a suggestion ( mller et al .",
    "2015 ) that argonium within the wnm might be a significant contributor to the observed arh@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "however , the predicted arh@xmath0 abundances within the wnm were found to be negligible relative to the observed values .",
    "in particular , the predicted arh@xmath0 abundance relative to atomic hydrogen was only @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ; this value lies @xmath53 orders - of - magnitude below the abundance typically measured in the ism .",
    "the very low arh@xmath0 abundance predicted for the wnm reflects the extremely low molecular fraction present in the warm neutral phase , @xmath54 , which means that ar@xmath0 ions produced by cosmic - ray ionization are much more likely to suffer recombination than to react further with h@xmath8 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show examples of the predicted cloud structure , for four of the 784 standard - metallicity models . for the models shown here , @xmath55  mag in all four cases ;",
    "@xmath40 = 1 ( left panels ) or 5 ( left panels ) ; and @xmath56 ( top panels ) or @xmath57 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "blue , magenta , black , green and brown curves show the abundances of arh@xmath0 , hcl@xmath0 , h@xmath8cl@xmath0 , oh@xmath0 , and h@xmath8o@xmath0 as a function of depth into the cloud .",
    "the depth is represented as a visual extinction beneath the cloud surface , @xmath58 , plotted on the horizontal axis on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the rightmost edge of the plot , with log@xmath59 therefore represents the cloud center .",
    "the abundances of the five molecular ions , each computed relative to h nuclei , are shown on a logarithmic scale in figure 1 and on a linear scale in figure 2 ( normalized here relative to the peak abundance . ) dotted red lines show the depths at which the molecular fraction , @xmath60 , reaches various values .",
    "the molecular fraction increases rapidly towards the cloud center as the h@xmath8 photodissociation rate drops precipitously due to self - shielding .",
    "the abundances of the five molecular ions reach their peak values at different depths .",
    "as discussed in  1 , arh@xmath0 shows its peak predicted abundance at the smallest depth , in a region where @xmath61 .",
    "the hcl@xmath0 abundance peaks at an intermediate depth , where @xmath62 , while oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8cl@xmath0 are typically most abundant where @xmath63 the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 abundance profiles often show two local maxima , one occurring at or near the cloud center where @xmath60 is largest .",
    "these behaviors have been noted and discussed extensively by neufeld et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and h12 in the case of the oxygen - bearing molecular ions , and by neufeld et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the case of the chlorine - bearing ions .",
    "in particular , the oh@xmath0/h@xmath8o@xmath0 and hcl@xmath0/h@xmath8cl@xmath0 ratios are controlled by the relative importance of h abstraction reactions [ e.g.  @xmath64 and dissociative recombination [ e.g.  @xmath65 .    as explained previously in h12 , the two local maxima in the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 abundances are the result of two separate production mechanisms . at small @xmath60 , the oxygen chemistry",
    "is initiated by the cosmic - ray ionization of h , followed by the reaction sequence @xmath66 ; at larger h@xmath8 , the cosmic - ray ionization of h@xmath8 is the initiating reaction , and is followed by @xmath67 .",
    "the results shown in figure 1 and 2 suggest that simultaneous observations of multiple molecular ions can be used to probe the relative amounts of gas with different molecular fractions within the diffuse ism , a possibility that will be investigated further in  4 below .    in figure 3",

    "different panels show the results obtained for various values of the uv radiation field ( @xmath40 . )",
    "solid red lines show the column - averaged molecular fraction , @xmath72 , the superscripted @xmath73 being introduced in this notation to indicate a ratio of column densities rather than number densities . for small crirs",
    ", @xmath74 depends only on @xmath75 and is independent of @xmath41 , resulting in horizontal red contours for @xmath74 . at the highest crirs ,",
    "however , the destruction of h@xmath8 by cosmic - rays becomes important , the column - averaged molecular fraction starts to drop with increasing @xmath41 , and the red contours of accordingly curve upwards .",
    "figure 3 indicates that the maximum @xmath68 attained at a given @xmath41 occurs near @xmath76 to @xmath13 .",

    "the @xmath68 ratio drops significantly for @xmath74 values above this range , but @xmath68 ratio remains within a factor @xmath53 of its maximum value for @xmath74 as small as @xmath80    in figures 4 and 5 , the @xmath68 ratio is shown , once again , in the plane of log@xmath70 $ ] and log@xmath71 .",

    "2015 ; gerin et al .",
    "2016 ) within diffuse clouds in the galactic disk ( excluding the galactic center region ) : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88",
    "the results shown in figures 4 and 5 indicate that a single population of clouds can not account for the typical @xmath68 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 abundance ratios observed in the diffuse ism . in particular , models with cloud parameters that can account for the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 abundances underpredict the arh@xmath0 abundance by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "for example , when @xmath83 , the typical @xmath81 and @xmath82 ratios suggest a population of diffuse clouds of visual extinction @xmath89  mag across each cloud , with a crir @xmath90 within which the column - averaged molecular fraction @xmath91 . for the same total visual extinction , the typically - observed arh@xmath0 abundance would require a crir an order of magnitude larger , @xmath92 while for the same crir required by the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 abundance , the visual extinction would need to be @xmath93  mag per cloud .",
    "these considerations suggest two possible explanations of the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath8o@xmath0 and arh@xmath0abundances observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "first , the crir could be a strongly - decreasing function of the visual extinction ( i.e. , the shielding column density ) , such that the regions very close to cloud surfaces , where arh@xmath0 is most abundant , are subject to a much larger cosmic - ray flux than the somewhat deeper regions where oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 are most abundant . in this scenario , which is not addressed by our standard diffuse clouds models",
    "( in which the cosmic - ray flux is assumed to be constant throughout the cloud ) , enough arh@xmath0 might be produced in the surface layers of the same clouds responsible for the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 absorption .",
    "second , the population of absorbing clouds within the galactic disk might possess a distribution of sizes , with the arh@xmath0 absorption occurring primarily in the smaller - extinction clouds and the oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 absorption arising primarily in clouds of larger extinction .",
    "this second possibility may be favored by the observational fact ( e.g. s14 , their figure 6 ; neufeld et al .  2015 , their figure 11 ) that arh@xmath0 has a distribution ( in line - of - sight velocity ) that is different from that of any other molecular ion , whereas oh@xmath0 and h@xmath8o@xmath0 show very similar absorption spectra .",
    "we have investigated the second scenario described above with a highly - idealized toy model in which the oh@xmath0 , h@xmath8o@xmath0 and arh@xmath0 absorption arises in a collection of clouds of two types : smaller clouds of visual extinction @xmath94 , and larger clouds of visual extinction @xmath95 .",
    "these cloud types are assumed to account for a fraction @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , of the hi mass , and both cloud types are assumed to be irradiated by the same cosmic - ray flux and uv radiation field . even if @xmath40 is specified , this model has four independent adjustable parameters ",
    "@xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath41  and is subject to three observational constraints : @xmath68 , @xmath81 and @xmath98 accordingly , there is no unique solution for given @xmath40 , but instead a set of solutions . in figure 4 , 10 pairs of vertically - separated circles indicate ten possible solutions ; one member of each pair represents a larger cloud type with log@xmath99 , and one member represents a smaller cloud type with log@xmath100 the radius of each circle is proportional to the required mass - fraction within each cloud type . by assumption , both cloud types are exposed to the same crir and thus each circle within a given pair has the same horizontal position .    an alternative presentation of the same information appears in figure 6 , where complete results are shown for multiple values of @xmath101 here , the following quantities are shown as a function of the assumed visual extinction across an individual smaller cloud : the required mass fraction of hi in the smaller clouds ( top left ) , the column- averaged molecular fraction in the smaller ( diamonds ) and larger ( asterisks ) clouds ( top right ) , the visual extinction required across an individual larger cloud ( bottom left ) , and the required crir ( bottom right ) .",
    "different colors represent different adopted values for @xmath101 if we now focus on canonical values for the uv isrf and gas density in the cold neutral medium , @xmath102 ( black curve ) , we find that the typical abundances observed for oh@xmath0 , h@xmath8o@xmath0 and arh@xmath0 can be explained by a combination of two cloud types : ( 1 ) smaller diffuse clouds , accounting for @xmath3{0,0,0}}{40 - 75}\\%$ ] of the gas mass and having a visual extinction @xmath103  mag and a column - averaged molecular fraction in the range @xmath104 to @xmath105 ; and ( 2 ) larger diffuse clouds , accounting for @xmath3{0,0,0}}{25 - 60}\\%$ ] of the gas mass and having a visual extinction @xmath106{0,0,0}}{0.2}$ ]  mag and a column - averaged molecular fraction @xmath4 . in the case of the smaller diffuse clouds ,",
    "acceptable fits can be obtained for the smallest values of @xmath75 that we considered ( and thus the smallest values of @xmath74 predicted in any of our models . ) the observed arh@xmath0 abundances are therefore entirely consistent with uv observations of h and h@xmath8 in diffuse clouds ; such observations indicate that most clouds have @xmath74 either greater than @xmath105 or smaller than @xmath107 and that relatively few clouds have @xmath74 in the intermediate range ( @xmath108 ) where h@xmath8 self - shielding results in a very strong dependence of @xmath74 upon @xmath75 ( e.g. liszt 2015 ; and references therein ) .    the highly - idealized two - component model presented here requires a primary crir in the range @xmath109{0,0,0}}{4 - 8 } \\times 10^{-16 } \\ , \\rm s^{-1}$ ] , for @xmath102 ( for the enhanced - metallicity models , the @xmath75 values required for the larger clouds are somewhat smaller , but the required ionization rates are very similar . )",
    "this range of primary crir lies slightly above the value @xmath110 needed to account for @xmath81 and @xmath82 with a single - component model , because in the two - component model , only 25 - 60@xmath111 of the hi is in the larger clouds that contribute most of the oh@xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the crir required for the two - component model is also a factor @xmath3{0,0,0}}{2.5 - 5}$ ] larger than the average value inferred by indriolo & mccall ( 2012 ) from observations of h@xmath20 in clouds of somewhat larger size than those considered here .",
    "this discrepancy may reflect the idealized nature of our two - component model or uncertainties in the chemistry ; alternatively , it may suggest that shielding does modulate the cosmic - ray flux in the regions where h@xmath20 is present .",
    "the question of the crir and its depth - dependence will be investigated further in a future paper .",
    "\\1 . we have presented a general parameter study , in which the argonium abundance is predicted using a model for the physics and chemistry of diffuse interstellar gas clouds .",
    "results have been obtained as a function of uv radiation field , @xmath40 , in the range 0.2 to 10 , cosmic - ray ionization rates , @xmath112 in the range @xmath113 to 6 @xmath114 and cloud extinctions , @xmath75 , in the range @xmath47 to 3 . 0.1 true in 2 . no single set of cloud parameters provides an acceptable fit to the typical arh@xmath0 , oh@xmath0 and @xmath1 abundances observed in diffuse clouds within the galactic disk .",
    "instead , the observed abundances suggest that arh@xmath0 resides primarily in separate population of small clouds of @xmath115  mag , within which the column - averaged molecular fraction is at most @xmath105 , while oh@xmath0 and @xmath1 reside primarily in somewhat larger clouds with a column - averaged molecular fraction @xmath4 .",
