    "the analysis of the spectra of regions allows to determine the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , s , ar and fe in the ionized phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "this is useful to trace the chemical evolution of the interstellar gas , to compute the radial abundance gradients in spiral galaxies and even to estimate the primordial helium abundance . due to the surface brightness of distant extragalactic regions it is possible to measure their line",
    "intensities with reasonable accuracy .",
    "therefore , it is essential and feasible to have confident determinations of their chemical composition .",
    "the possibility to obtain deep spectra of regions with large telescopes allows us to detect and measure important faint emission lines . among these , recombination lines ( hereafter rls ) of heavy element ions are of special interest .",
    "the brightest rls of heavy element ions in the optical domain are 4267  and those of multiplet 1 of around 4650",
    ". these are in fact very faint lines that have an intensity of the order of 0.001@xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "these lines can give us a more complete view of the physics and chemical content of nebulae and can be used to test if the standard methods for deriving chemical abundances based on the intensity of bright collisionally excited lines ( hereafter cels) are valid .",
    "the ionic abundances of elements heavier than he are usually derived from the intensity of cels , which depend exponentially on the electron temperature ( @xmath6 ) of the nebular gas .",
    "this fact makes necessary to have a very precise determination of @xmath6 to obtain reliable ionic abundances .",
    "@xcite found that in the presence of inhomogeneities or stratification in the spatial distribution of @xmath6 ( the so - called temperature fluctuations , defined by the mean square temperature variation over the observed volume : @xmath7 ) the ionic abundances obtained from the intensity of cels are systematically underestimated . in comparison ,",
    "ionic abundances determined from rls are almost independent on @xmath6 and are not sensible to the effects of possible temperature structure inside the nebula .",
    "however , the faintness of these lines makes very difficult their measurement and even their detection . @xcite",
    "have obtained high resolution observations of the galactic regions orion nebula , m8 , and m17 , obtaining good measurements of and lines in the three objects .",
    "these authors have found that ionic abundances derived from those rls are systematically larger than the values obtained from cels .",
    "a similar result has been obtained by @xcite who present measurements of , , and lines for orion nebula , m17 , ngc 3576 , and three magellanic clouds regions ( 30 doradus , lmc n11 , and smc n66 ) .",
    "the main aim of the observations reported in this paper was to detect and measure and lines in bright giant extragalactic regions ( hereafter gehrs ) of the northern hemisphere .",
    "these observations will permit to compare the o@xmath0 abundances obtained by both cels and rls from the same spectrum as well as to derive the c@xmath0 abundance and compare them with the values derived by other authors from space observations of the uv [ ] 1907 @xmath8 ] 1909  lines .",
    "the observations were made on 2001 february 25 and 26 at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma ) , using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) with the isis spectrograph at the cassegrain focus .",
    "two different ccds were used at the blue and red arms of the spectrograph : an eev12 ccd with a configuration of 4096@xmath42048 pixels of 13 @xmath9 m in the blue arm and a tek with 1024@xmath41024 of 24 @xmath9 m in the red arm .",
    "the spatial scale was 0.19 arcsec pixel@xmath10 and 0.36 arcsec pixel@xmath10 for the blue and red arms respectively .",
    "the maximum unvignetted slit - length usable with isis is 3.7@xmath11 and the width was 1@xmath12 .",
    "the dichroic used to separate the blue and red beams was set at 5400 .",
    "two gratings were used , a 1200 g mm@xmath10 one in the blue and a 316 g mm@xmath10 one in the red arm .",
    "these gratings gave reciprocal dispersions of 17 and 62  mm@xmath10 , and effective resolutions of 0.73  and 2.9  for the blue and red arms , respectively .",
    "the blue spectra cover from 4230  to 5060   and the red ones from 5720  to 7200 .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table 1 .",
    "the average seeing was between 0.8@xmath12 and 2@xmath12 throughout the observations .",
    "the slit center and position angle ( pa ) was chosen to cover the brightest zone of each region .",
    "for ngc  604 we centered our slit on zone d defined by @xcite that was also observed by @xcite .",
    "ngc  5461 is rather compact and we placed the slit center on the bright core passing through two fainter regions located at 15 and 30 arcsec to the southeast ( see image shown by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for ngc  5471 we centered the slit passing through the knots labeled as a and c by ( * ?",
    "* see his figure 1 ) .",
    "finally , for ngc  2363 our slit position covered knots a and b defined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 ) .",
    "several 30 min exposures were combined to produce the final blue and red spectra of the objects .",
    "as we can see in table 1 , the total exposure time for the objects was very large ( between 2.5 and 7 hours ) , this indicates that we are at the limit of the possibilities of a 4m - class telescope .",
    "comparison lamp exposures ( cuar + cune ) were taken between consecutive spectra of the same object .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was achieved by observations of the standard stars feige 15 , feige 25 , feige 56 @xcite , feige 34 , g191 b2b @xcite , and bd+33 2642 @xcite .",
    "the correction for atmospheric extinction was performed using an average curve for the continuous atmospheric extinction at roque de los muchachos observatory .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard @xmath13 longslit reduction package to perform bias corrections , flatfielding , cosmic ray rejection and flux calibration .",
    "line intensities were measured integrating all the flux in the line between two given limits and over a local continuum estimated by eye . in the few cases of line - blending ,",
    "the line flux of each individual line was derived from a multiple gaussian profile fit procedure .",
    "all these measurements were made with the splot routine of the @xmath13 package .",
    "all the line intensities of a given spectrum have been normalized to a particular bright recombination line present in each wavelength interval . for the blue spectra the reference line was h@xmath14 . for ngc  604 , ngc  5461 and ngc  2363 it was necessary to take shorter exposures in the red arm to avoid problems of saturation of h@xmath15 . in these three objects",
    "we normalized the line intensities measured in the longer exposure spectra to @xmath16 5876 .",
    "finally , the intensity ratios were re - scaled to the @xmath17 ( 5876)/@xmath17(h@xmath15 ) ratio obtained from the shorter exposure red spectra .    the reddening coefficient , @xmath18(h@xmath14 ) , was determined by fitting iteratively the observed @xmath17(h@xmath14)/@xmath17(h@xmath19 ) ratio to the theoretical one computed by @xcite for the physical conditions determined for each object ( see below ) and assuming the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "the balmer line intensities were not corrected for the presence of underlying stellar absorption lines due to their large equivalent widths in emission . in table 2",
    "we present the @xmath20(h@xmath14 ) values for all the objects .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath21 4388 , 4471 , and 4922 lines present in table 2 were corrected for underlying absorption considering the starburst models of @xcite and considering that the observed continuum is due to a stellar component plus a nebular component .",
    "the observed intensities of these helium lines ( corrected for reddening but not for underlying absorption ) were : 0.50 , 4.14 , and 1.07 for ngc  604 ; 0.41 , 4.11 , and 1.09 for ngc  5461 ; 0.41 , 3.89 , and 0.89 for ngc  5471 ; and 0.46 , 3.93 , and 0.98 for ngc  2363 .",
    "the line intensities of the blue arm spectra were corrected for reddening with respect to h@xmath14 and the red arm ones with respect to h@xmath15 . finally , the resulting reddening corrected line ratios of the red arm spectra were re - scaled to @xmath17(h@xmath14 ) simply multiplying by the theoretical @xmath17(h@xmath15)/@xmath17(h@xmath14 ) corresponding to the physical conditions derived for each nebula .",
    "the values of @xmath18(h@xmath14 ) obtained are consistent with those obtained by other authors for ngc  604 ( 0.30 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc  5471 ( 0.02 : garnett et al .",
    "1999 ; 0.18 : luridiana et al .",
    "2002 ) , slightly lower in the case of ngc  5461 ( 0.56 : garnett et al . 1999 ; 0.45 : luridiana et al .",
    "2002 ) , and clearly higher in the case of ngc  2363 ( 0.25 : peimbert et al . 1986",
    "; 0.20 : gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "the reason of the large difference found in the case of ngc  2363 is unknown but seems to be a real feature and not an error in the flux calibration nor an effect of atmospheric refraction .",
    "the final spectrum used for ngc  2363 is a combination of several spectra taken in two consecutive nights , calibrated independently with different standard stars and giving a similar value of @xmath18(h@xmath14 ) ( 0.74 for february 25th and 0.66 for february 26th ) . in any case , the effect on the derived intensity ratios is not large because the emission lines of the blue arm spectra have been corrected for reddening with respect to h@xmath14 and those of the red arm with respect to h@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the wavelength baseline between the lines is not large enough to produce strong intensity uncertainties . by comparing the intensities obtained from our @xmath18(h@xmath14 ) value with those obtained from the @xmath18(h@xmath14 ) value by @xcite",
    "the differences in the line intensities reach a maximum of 15% for the c ii 4267 , [ ] 5755 , and 5876  lines and are considerably smaller for the other lines .",
    "the final list of observed wavelengths ( referred to the heliocentric reference frame ) and line intensities ( including their uncertainties ) relative to h@xmath14 for all the objects is presented in table 2 .",
    "colons indicate uncertainties of the order of or larger than 40 per cent . for a given emission line ,",
    "the observed wavelength is determined by the centroid of a gaussian fit of its line profile and it is included in columns 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 of table 2 .",
    "figures 1 to 4 show the spectra of the four gehrs observed .",
    "enlargement of the spectral zones containing 4267  line and the lines of multiplet 1 of ( around 4650 ) are included in the figures .",
    "it is evident that the 4267  line is well measured in the spectra of ngc  604 and ngc  5461 and barely detected in ngc  2363 and ngc  5471 .",
    "@xcite showed that recombination dominates the excitation of 4267  by an order of magnitude .",
    "this line comes from a transition involving terms with large @xmath22 values ( 3@xmath23 - 4@xmath24 ) , levels that can not be excited by permitted resonance transitions from the ground term ( 2@xmath25 ) .",
    "we have detected several lines of different multiplets of in the spectra of the gehrs observed . in most of the cases",
    "the lines are at the detection level , only those belonging to multiplet 1 the brightest one have enough signal - to - noise ratio to be reasonably well measured ( see figures 1 to 4 ) .",
    "several lines of multiplet 1 of are measured in the objects except in the case of ngc  5471 , where only one line is detected .",
    "it is worth noting that ls - coupling predicts that 4649  is the brightest line of multiplet 1 , and this is what it is observed in ngc  5461 , ngc  2363 , and also in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of ngc  604 that line is too weak with respect the other lines of the multiplet .",
    "this anomalous trend has been reported in the spectra of the two slit positions observed in m17 by @xcite as well as in the three magellanic cloud regions observed by @xcite , but to a lesser extent , in some planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that this might be caused by the under - population of the ground @xmath26 fine - structure level of the recombining o@xmath0 relative to its statistical equilibrium value .",
    "the excitation mechanism of the spectrum was also investigated by @xcite .",
    "the presence of many emission lines of different multiplets of in the spectra of regions can not be explained by resonance fluorescence , in fact some of those observed in ngc  604 come from 4f-3d transitions ( multiplets 66 and 67 ) these lines can not be excited by fluorescence from the 2@xmath27@xmath28 ground level .",
    "therefore , recombination is the dominant excitation mechanism of the observed lines in ngc  604 , but very probably for regions in general .",
    "we have observed several lines of in all the objects .",
    "these lines belong to multiplets 2 and 4 , which correspond to doublets .",
    "@xcite has found that starlight excitation of the 5@xmath29 and 4@xmath23 terms ( levels that feed the observed transitions ) dominates over recombination in producing the observed intensities in regions .",
    "other interesting lines observed are those of ] , the strongest semiforbidden optical lines in nebular spectra , corresponding to @xmath30 transitions .",
    "these lines have been observed in bright planetary nebulae ( pne ) and are always weak , with intensity in the range 0.05 - 1.00 per cent of the h@xmath14 intensity ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite measured the ] 4571.1  line in the orion nebula ( intensity about 0.009 percent of h@xmath14 ) , as far as we know , the first detection of this line reported in an region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that the weakness of this line in pne is due to the mg@xmath31+h@xmath32 charge - transfer reaction , in the absence of which the intensity would be higher .",
    "this conclusion can be also applied to the spectra of regions .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "it can be seen that ngc  604 and ngc  5461 show broad emission features around @xmath16 4650  and @xmath16 5800 , which are produced by wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "the bump in the blue spectra is produced by the blend of 4686 , 4640 , and perhaps 4620 , characteristic of wn stars .",
    "on the other hand , the detection of the 5808  broad emission feature indicates the presence of wc stars which can also contribute to a fraction of the emission around @xmath16 4650 .",
    "the detection of wr stars in ngc  604 was independently reported by @xcite and @xcite . in their spectroscopical study of ngc  604",
    "@xcite detect wc emission at their zone d , which encompasses the brightest part of our slit position in this object .",
    "@xcite obtain @xmath33 images of the ionizing cluster of ngc  604 finding three individual wr stars ( their wr1 , wr2a , and wr2b ) in the zone in common with our extracted 1-d spectrum . in the case of ngc  5461 , the presence of the blue wr bump around 4650  was first detected by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "our deep spectrum of ngc  5461 has revealed also a faint bump corresponding to 5808 , this indicates -for the first time- the presence of wc stars in this region .",
    "there are several references about the detection of wr stars in ngc  5471 , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but we only find faint narrow 4686  emission in our deep spectrum .",
    "@xcite report broad and nebular 4686  emission in the brightest zone of ngc  2363 ( zone a ) .",
    "however , we only find nebular 4686  emission in this zone .    the lines of multiplet 1 are in the problematic spectral zone where the wr emission feature is present .",
    "this could lead to be suspicious of some contamination of stellar emission in the lines identified as .",
    "however , several reasons lead us to be fairly confident that the emission lines identified as belonging to are of true nebular nature and not due to stellar emission .",
    "firstly , the detection of several lines that can be identified as of ( except for ngc  5471 ) .",
    "secondly , the observed rest wavelength of all the lines are consistent with their identification as ones inside the uncertainties in the wavelength calibration .",
    "finally , they have a line width similar to that of the rest of the nebular lines .",
    "in fact the width of the wr bump in ngc  604 and ngc  5461 is clearly much broader than the nebular lines .",
    "our relatively high spectral resolution permits a proper discrimination between nebular and stellar emission in this problematic spectral zone .    in table 3",
    "we show the physical conditions derived for the four gehrs from the observed emission line ratios and the five - level program for the analysis of emission line nebulae of @xcite . the electron density ,",
    "@xmath34 has been derived from the ratio of the [ ] 6717 , 6731  doublet for all the objects and also from the [ ] 4711 , 4740  doublet in the case of the higher degree of ionization nebulae ( ngc  5471 and ngc  2363 ) . the electron temperature ,",
    "@xmath6 has been derived from both the [ ] and [ ] emission line ratios .",
    "the values of @xmath34 and @xmath6 obtained are in good agreement with those reported in previous works . in the case of ngc  2363 , we report the first determination of @xmath35 ( [ ] ) .",
    "ionic abundances of n@xmath32 , o@xmath0 , s@xmath32 , s@xmath0 , ar@xmath0 , ar@xmath36 , and k@xmath36 have been obtained from the intensity of cels , using the five - level atom program of @xcite , and the atomic parameters referenced in it .",
    "we have measured several [ ] lines in all the regions and detected [ ] lines in ngc  5471 ( one line ) and ngc  2363 ( four lines ) .",
    "although [ ] lines were previously reported in ngc  5461 @xcite and ngc  5471 @xcite , the fe@xmath0/h@xmath32 ratio has been never determined for these objects .",
    "following @xcite , we have used the collision strengths of @xcite and transition probabilities of @xcite to obtain the fe@xmath0 abundance .",
    "no optical [ ] lines have been previously detected with confidence in regions .",
    "@xcite report a dubious detection of [ ] 4907  in a low resolution spectrum of the blue compact dwarf galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 and @xcite report the detection of [ ] 2837  in the uv spectrum of the orion nebula .",
    "therefore ngc  2363 and ngc  5471 are -by now- the regions where optical [ ] lines have been most clearly identified .",
    "the fe@xmath36/h@xmath32 ratio has been determined considering all collisional and downward radiative transitions from the 33 lower levels of fe@xmath36 . to make these calculations we have used the collision strengths of @xcite and the transition probabilities recommended by @xcite and those of @xcite for those transitions not included in that reference .",
    "we have assumed a two - zone scheme for deriving the ionic abundances , adopting @xmath35 ( [ ] ) for the high - ionization - potential ions o@xmath0 , s@xmath0 , ar@xmath0 , ar@xmath36 , k@xmath36 , and fe@xmath36 and @xmath35 ( [ ] ) for the low - ionization - potential ions n@xmath32 , s@xmath32 , and fe@xmath0 .",
    "the ionic abundances obtained are listed in table 4 .",
    "we can derive ionic abundances from rls for c@xmath0 , and o@xmath0 and they are presented in table 5 .",
    "4267  is a case - insensitive recombination line and it is located in a spectral zone without problems of line - blending .",
    "these important features make 4267  a suitable line to derive a proper value of the c@xmath0 abundance .",

    "we have compared the c@xmath0/h@xmath32 ratios obtained making use of the different cii @xmath37 values finding that @xcite and @xcite give virtually the same abundances ( inside @xmath380.01 dex ) whilst the cii @xmath37 obtained by @xcite gives c@xmath0/h@xmath32 ratios about 0.08 dex higher .",

    "the physical conditions assumed are the same as for the calculations .",
    "the abundances determined from multiplet 1 are almost independent of the case but case b seems to be more appropriate for quartets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "taking into account the faintness of the individual lines of we have derived the abundances adding the intensity of all the observed lines of multiplet 1 and multiplying it by a correction factor which introduces the expected contribution of unobserved lines of the multiplet assuming ls - coupling ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance derived by this method reduce the observational errors related with the faintness of the lines and minimize the effects of possible departures from ls - coupling , as it has been noticed to occur in several objects considering the weakness of 4649  line with respect the other ones of the same multiplet ( see sect .",
    "ionic abundances from cels often differ from those derived from rls in ionized nebulae . @xcite",
    "have found that the difference is between 0.1 and 0.3 dex in three of the brightest galactic regions .",
    "moreover , @xcite obtain similar differences for the orion nebula and m17 and between 0.30 and 0.69 dex for three magellanic clouds regions . in the case of planetary nebulae ( pne )",
    "the differences vary from one object to another and can be as large as a factor of ten for some pne @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between the abundances obtained from cels and rls is a crucial problem because most of our knowledge of chemical abundances in distant objects -specially in extragalactic ones- comes from determinations based on the intensity of cels .",
    "@xcite proposed that the abundance discrepancy between calculations based on cels and rls may be produced by the presence of spatial fluctuations of the electron temperature in the nebulae , parametrized by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this is due to the different dependence of the emissivity of cels and rls on electron temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "while the ratio of two rls is almost independent of @xmath6 , the ratio of a cel with respect to a rl is strongly dependent on it .",
    "another argument in favor of the presence of temperature variations in gaseous nebulae is the determination of @xmath7 and @xmath39 based on @xmath35 ( [ ] ) and @xmath35(bac ) . some of the best determinations of @xmath35(bac ) in planetary nebulae are those by peimbert ( 1971 ) , liu & danziger ( 1993 ) , liu et al .",

    "torres - peimbert and peimbert(2003 ) present a review on tempertaure variations in planetary nebulae and discuss seven possible causes that could explain temperature variations in a given object .",
    "one of the possible explanations could be due to the presence of a small mass of extremely cold ( @xmath6 @xmath41 10@xmath42 k ) , metal and helium - rich inclusions embedded in diffuse material of `` normal '' temperature and abundances ( see liu 2002 , 2003 ; pequignot et al .",

    "we have also derived the gas - phase fe / h ratio simply adding the fe@xmath0/h@xmath32 and fe@xmath36/h@xmath32 ratios , which are expected to contain about the 97% of the total fe abundance in the gas - phase according to the reference models .",
    "the fe / h ratio obtained assuming @xmath57s are in both cases much larger than the direct determination ( 0.35 dex for ngc  5471 and 0.65 for ngc  2363 ) .",
    "this result was also obtained by @xcite in the case of the orion nebula , where their determination of the fe / h ratio from the intensity of [ ] 2837  line are much lower than the values obtained from the fe@xmath0/h@xmath32 ratios and assuming an @xmath57 from detailed photoionization models .",
    "we agree with the suggestion of @xcite that a reexamination of fe@xmath36 atomic data and perhaps improving region modeling would help to solve this problem .",
    "the determination of the o / h and c / h ratios in ngc  5461 and ngc  5471 allows to derive the radial abundance gradients of these two elements in m101 .",
    "the galactocentric distance of both regions is very different .",
    "ngc  5461 is located at 11.1 kpc and ngc  5471 at 26.2 kpc assuming a distance of 7.5 mpc for m101 @xcite .",
    "the oxygen abundance gradient has been derived for m101 by many authors @xcite .",
    "our value of @xmath470.038 dex kpc@xmath10 has been computed from the o / h ratios obtained from rls ( using cels and @xmath62 the slope becomes @xmath470.035 dex kpc@xmath10 ) and it is consistent with previous determinations ( @xmath470.044 : vila - costas and edmunds 1992 ; @xmath470.040 to @xmath470.050 : kennicutt and garnett 1992 ; @xmath470.028 : pilyugin 2001 ) although it is rather uncertain due to the large observational error of the o / h ratio of ngc  5471 .",

    "o ratios are 0.22 and 0.05 dex higher that those obtained by other authors @xcite .    the value of the c / h gradient and the c / o ratio derived by us for ngc 5461 favor the results for @xmath45 = 5.0 of @xcite .",
    "our c / h value for ngc 5471 is very uncertain , therefore for the following discussion we will consider the c / o gradient of @xcite for @xmath45 = 5.0 .",
    "the exact value of the c / o gradient in a spiral galaxy is a strong constraint for models of chemical evolution and the star formation history .",
    "the evolution of c / o with o / h is very sensitive to the star formation / enrichment timescale because the different initial mass range of the main producers of both elements .",
    "the o / h gradient for the milky way obtained by @xcite based on rls is rather similar to the value found for m101 and it has been also included in table 10 for comparison .",
    "the slope of the galactic c / h gradient included in table 10 is a revision of the value given by @xcite in their table 13 .",
    "this new slope has been re - calculated considering the recombination coefficients by @xcite and an error in the c@xmath0/h@xmath32 ratio of m  17 present in that paper ( see sect .",
    "a general correlation between c / o and o / h was obtained by @xcite from uv observations of regions of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "this trend was later confirmed by @xcite from similar observations of six regions in the spiral galaxies m101 and ngc  2403 . we have found a similar behavior in our data , which are shown in figure 5 along with the values for the orion nebula , m8 and m17 @xcite , and the sun @xcite .",
    "this graph is relevant because all the nebular data included are abundances derived from recombination lines , almost insensitive to potential electron temperature variations inside the nebulae .    the presence of c / o gradients in the milky way and m101 is a reflection of this correlation between c / o and metallicity .",
    "the behavior of c / o vs. o / h can be approximated by a power law @xmath63 we have performed a regression analysis of the nebular data included in figure 5 finding @xmath64 = 0.56 @xmath38 0.10 ( by considering only the four gehrs we find @xmath64 = 0.30 @xmath38 0.15 ) .",
    "this value of the slope is consistent with those obtained by @xcite from a compilation of data for dwarf irregular galaxies ( 0.41@xmath380.07 ) and the larger compilation by @xcite that includes irregular and spiral galaxies ( slope between 0.48 and 0.59 ) .",
    "this behaviour gives important insights into the origin and evolution of both elements .",
    "simple chemical evolution models with instantaneous recycling predict a c / o = constant if both c and o are pure primary elements , and c / o @xmath65 o / h if o is primary and c secondary . as @xcite have pointed out , since only primary sources of c are known to exist , the observed behavior of c / o vs. o / h indicates that the instantaneous recycling approximation does not hold for both elements and/or the yield of c varies with respect to o. in chemical evolution models that assume infall of primordial gas without galactic winds or radial outflows and a star formation rate proportional to @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the surface gas density , @xmath68 is the total surface mass density , and @xmath69 is constant in time and space ) , the predicted c / o ratio depends mainly on the stellar yields and the initial mass function .    based on chemical evolution models for the galactic disk @xcite",
    "has studied the c and o gradients assuming different sets of stellar yields dependent on metallicity .",
    "this author has shown that the observed c / o vs. o / h relation as well as the presence of negative c / o gradients in spiral galaxies can be explained with the metallicity - dependent yields for c and o for massive stars with radiatively driven mass loss derived by @xcite . in figure 5",
    "we have also plotted the prediction of selected models ( those that reproduce the observed relation ) obtained by @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the position of the galactic objects is well reproduced by the models .",
    "however , as @xcite have pointed out changes in the assumed star formation law through its dependence on the power of the gas surface density can change the curves , mainly shifting the curves in the c / o axis .",
    "therefore , models for the solar vicinity do not necessarily reproduce correctly the chemical evolution of galaxies with different gas consumption timescales .",
    "additional parameters that can be used to constrain models of galactic chemical evolution are @xmath70 and @xmath1/@xmath3 ; these values are obtained by assuming that the galaxies form with the primordial helium abundance and no heavy elements .",
    "the best objects to obtain this parameter are ngc 604 and ngc 5461 due to their high @xmath71 and @xmath48 abundances .    in table 11",
    "we present the helium , oxygen and heavy elements by mass ( @xmath48 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ) for ngc 604 and ngc 5461 . to derive the @xmath71 values we have added 0.08 dex to the gaseous values to take into account the fraction of heavy elements tied up in dust grains . to derive the heavy element content by mass of ngc 604 and ngc",
    "5461 we made the following considerations : a ) we added 0.08 dex and 0.10 dex to the @xmath71 and @xmath18 gaseous abundances respectively to take into account the fraction of these atoms tied up in dust grains @xcite ; b ) we assumed that @xmath73 were representative of the total @xmath72 value and based on the solar abundances by @xcite and by @xcite we obtained that @xmath73 made up 69% of the total @xmath72 value ,    also in table 11 we include the @xmath48 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 values obtained by @xcite based on the line intensities by @xcite for m17 , the galactic region with the best helium abundance determination . to derive the total @xmath72 values these authors assumed that @xmath18 , @xmath74 , @xmath71 and @xmath75 were representative of the @xmath72 value , and based on the solar abundances by @xcite and @xcite they found that these four elements amount to 79% of the total @xmath72 value .",

    "for the galactic disk at the solar vicinity @xcite find @xmath70 = 3.15 , @xcite derived values in the 2.4 to 3.4 range , and @xcite obtains @xmath70 ratios between 2.9 and 4.6 , while closed box models for irregular galaxies by @xcite and @xcite give values in the 2.95 to 4.2 range . in table 11",
    "we can see that the @xmath70 ratios for @xmath7 @xmath77 0 are in the 2.55 to 4 range in good agreement with the galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "similarly the models of chemical evolution of the galaxy mentioned in the previous paragraph predict @xmath78 values in the 1.22 range .",
    "again the values derived from observations under the assumption that @xmath7 @xmath77 0 are in better agreement with the models than those derived under the assumption that @xmath79 ( see table 12 ) .",

    "the presence of values of @xmath7 @xmath77 0 in gehrs has important consequences in various fields of astrophysics , mainly because most of our knowledge about the chemical content of extragalactic objects comes from the spectra of gehrs .",
