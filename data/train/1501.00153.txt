    "due to the ever - growing need for more efficient and scalable systems for cloud storage and data storage in general , distributed storage has become an increasingly important ingredient in many data systems . in their seminal paper @xcite ,",
    "dimakis _ et al .",
    "_ introduced network coding techniques for large - scale distributed storage systems such as data centers , cloud storage , peer - to - peer storage systems and storage in wireless networks .",
    "these techniques can , for example , considerably improve the storage efficiency compared to traditional storage techniques such as replication and erasure coding .",
    "failing devices are not uncommon in large - scale distributed storage systems @xcite .",
    "a central problem for this type of storage is therefore to design codes that have good distributed repair properties .",
    "several cost metrics and related tradeoffs @xcite are studied in the literature , for example _ repair bandwidth _",
    "@xcite , _ disk - i / o _",
    "@xcite , and _ repair locality _ @xcite . in this paper repair locality is the subject of interest .",
    "the notion of a _ locally repairable code _ ( lrc ) was introduced in @xcite , and such repair - efficient codes are already used in existing distributed storage systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the hadoop distributed file system _ raid _ used by facebook and windows azure storage @xcite .",
    "there are two notions of _ symbol locality _ considered in the literature : information locality only requires information symbols to be locally repairable , while all - symbol locality requires this to be true for all code symbols .",
    "the subject of interest in this paper is the all - symbol locality .",
    "it is well - known that nonlinear codes often achieve better performance than linear ones , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the context of coding rates for error - correcting codes and maximal throughput for network codes .",
    "almost affine codes were introduced in @xcite as a generalization of linear codes .",
    "this class of codes contains codes over arbitrary alphabet size , not necessarily prime power . in this paper",
    ", we are studying lrcs in the generality of almost affine codes .",
    "we will consider five key invariants @xmath0 of locally repairable codes .",
    "the technical definitions are given in section  [ sec : lrc ] , but in short , a good code should have large rate @xmath1 as well as high global and local failure tolerance @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to have small @xmath4 , which will determine the maximum number of nodes that have to be contacted for repair within a `` local '' repair set .    in this paper , our main tools for analyzing lrcs",
    "come from matroid theory .",
    "this is a branch of algebraic combinatorics with natural links to a great number of different topics , _",
    "e.g. _ , to coding theory , graph theory , matching theory and combinatorial optimization .",
    "matroids were introduced in @xcite in order to abstractly capture properties analogous to linear independence in vector spaces and independence in graphs . since its introduction , matroid theory has been successfully used to solve problems in many areas of mathematics and computer science .",
    "matroid theory and the theory of linear codes are closely related since every matrix over a field defines a matroid .",
    "despite this fact , until rather recently matroid theory has only played a minor part in the development of coding theory .",
    "one pioneering work in this area is the paper by greene from 1976 @xcite . in this paper",
    "he describes how the weight enumerator of a linear code @xmath5 is determined by the tutte polynomial of the associated matroid of @xmath5 . using this result",
    ", greene gives an elegant proof of the macwilliams identity @xcite .",
    "generalizations of these results have then been presented in several papers , for example in @xcite .",
    "another important instance of matroidal methods in coding theory is the development of a decomposition theory of binary linear codes @xcite .",
    "today , matroid theory also plays an important role in information theory and coding theory , for example in the areas of network coding , secret sharing , index coding , and information inequalities @xcite . in this paper , while our main goal is investigating almost affine lrcs with the aid of matroid theory , ideas from the theory of lrcs will also be utilized to acquire new results in matroid theory .",
    "one of the most classical theorems in coding theory is the singleton bound , discussed in section  [ sec : singleton ]  @xcite .",
    "its classical version bounds the minimum distance @xmath2 of a code from above in terms of the length @xmath6 and dimension @xmath7 .",
    "recent work sharpens the bound in terms of the local parameters @xmath8  @xcite , as well as in terms of other parameters  @xcite .",
    "there are different constructions of lrcs that are optimal in the sense that they achieve a generalized singleton bound , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigate for which parameters @xmath9 there exists a linear lrc with all - symbol locality and minimum distance @xmath2 achieving the generalized singleton bound from  @xcite .",
    "the parameter set @xmath9 is divided into eight different classes . in four of these classes",
    "it is proven that there are linear lrcs achieving the bound , in two of these classes it is proven that there are no linear lrcs achieving the bound , and the existence of linear lrcs achieving the bound in the remaining two cases is an open question . independently to the research in this paper , wang and zhang used linear programming approaches to strengthen these results when @xmath10  @xcite .    it was shown in @xcite , that the @xmath4-locality of a linear lrc is a matroid invariant .",
    "this was used in @xcite to prove that the minimum distance of a class of linear lrcs achieves a generalized singleton bound .",
    "moreover , there are several instances of results in the theory of linear codes that have been generalized to all matroids .",
    "examples on how these results can be interpreted for other objects that can represent a matroid , such as graphs , transversals and certain designs can be found in  @xcite .",
    "recently , the present authors have studied locally repairable codes with all - symbol locality @xcite .",
    "methods to modify already existing codes were presented and it was shown that with high probability , a certain random matrix will be a generator matrix for a locally repairable code with a good minimum distance .",
    "constructions were given for three infinite classes of optimal vector - linear locally repairable codes over an alphabet of small size .",
    "the present paper extends and deviates from this work by studying the combinatorics of lrcs in general and relating lrcs to matroid theory .",
    "this allows for the derivation of fundamental bounds for matroids and linear and almost affine lrcs , as well as for the characterization of the matroids achieving this bound .    in this paper",
    ", we have chosen to call the codes and matroids achieving the generalized singleton bound _",
    "perfect _ instead of optimal , reserving the term optimal for the best existing solution , _",
    "i.e. _ , for codes achieving a tight bound instead of the ( in some cases loose ) singleton bound .",
    "see definition [ def : perfect ] and the follow - up footnote for more details .      the first contribution of this paper is to extend the definitions of the parameters @xmath0 in @xcite from linear codes to the much larger class of almost affine codes , and to show that these parameters are matroid invariant for all almost affine lrcs .",
    "we then proceed to prove the main results of this paper , which can be summarized as follows :    a.   a matroid analogue of the generalized singleton bound in  @xcite is given for @xmath0-matroids , and in particular to all almost affine codes in theorem [ th : bound ] .",
    "b.   in theorem [ th : structure - optimal - matroid ] , some necessary structural properties are given for an @xmath0-matroid meeting the generalized singleton bound . c.   in theorem  [ thm : construction ] , a class of matroids is given with different values of the parameters @xmath0 .",
    "simple and explicit constructions of matroids in this class are given in theorem [ thm : construction ] , theorem [ theorem : graph_1 ] , and corollary [ corollary : graph_2 ] , and in examples [ exam : graph_construction_1 ] , [ exam : graph_construction_2a ] and [ exam : graph_construction_2b ] .",
    "d.   in section [ sec : representability ] , we prove that the matroids from theorem  [ thm : construction ] are representable over finite fields of large enough size .",
    "hence we obtain four explicit constructions of linear lrcs with given parameters .",
    "the representability is derived by constructing a graph supporting a gammoid isomorphic to the matroid in theorem  [ thm : construction ] , and using results on representability of gammoids  @xcite .",
    "e.   theorem  [ thm : max_d ] characterizes values of @xmath9 for which there exist @xmath0-matroids meeting the bound ( i ) .",
    "in particular , the nonexistence results for linear lrcs in @xcite are extended to the nonexistence of almost affine codes and matroids . moreover , in theorem  [ thm : non_existence_lrc ] and theorem  [ thm : max_d_lrc ] , we settle the existence in one of the regimes left open in  @xcite , leaving open only a minor subregime of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this complements recent and independent research by wang and zhang  @xcite , where they settle the existence in the subregime @xmath14 and @xmath10 using integer programming techniques .",
    "the proofs of some of the longer theorems and the explicit constructions of matroids with prescribed parameters are given in the appendix .",
    "in this subsection , we introduce the parameters @xmath0 defined in @xcite for linear locally repairable codes .",
    "we extend this definition to the much wider class of almost affine codes , to be introduced in  [ sec : almostaffine ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cloud ] serves as a visual aid for the technical definitions .",
    "the information symbols @xmath15 are stored on twelve nodes as in the figure .",
    "equivalently , we think of the content of the twelve nodes as a codeword , and of the content of an individual node as a code symbol . within each of the local clouds ( or locality sets ) ,",
    "three symbols are enough to determine the other two .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig : cloud ] depicts a @xmath16-lrc , according to the following definitions .",

    "we say that @xmath5 is a _ locally repairable code ( lrc ) _ with _ all - symbol locality _",
    "@xmath8 if all the @xmath6 symbols of the code are contained in an @xmath8-locality set .",
    "the locality sets can be also referred to as the local repair sets .",
    "we remark that the symbols in a locality set @xmath35 can be used to recover up to @xmath36 lost symbols in the same locality set .",
    "further , we note that each of the following statements are equivalent to statement ( ii ) above :    1 .   for any @xmath29 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath39 , 2 .   for any @xmath40 with @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 , 3 .",
    "@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the minimum distance of @xmath45 .",
    "an lrc with parameters @xmath46 , minimum distance @xmath2 , and all - symbol locality @xmath8 is an @xmath0-lrc .",
    "since we focus only on all - symbol locality in this paper , we will henceforth use the term lrc to mean a locally repairable code with all - symbol locality .      for any @xmath47-linear code with minimum distance @xmath2 ,",
    "the singleton bound is given by @xmath48 this bound was generalized for locally repairable codes in @xcite ( the case @xmath10 ) and @xcite ( general @xmath3 ) as follows . a linear lrc with parameters @xmath0 satisfies @xmath49 while the bounds in @xcite and @xcite are stated assuming only information locality",
    ", so are of course in particular still valid under the stronger assumption of all - symbol locality .",
    "other generalizations of the singleton bound for linear and nonlinear lrcs can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us fix some standard graph - theoretic notation that will be used at two stages in the constructions .",
    "a ( finite ) directed graph @xmath50 is a pair of a finite _ vertex set _ @xmath51 , whose elements are called nodes or vertices , and an _ edge set _ @xmath52 of pairs called arcs or edges .",
    "graphs are often drawn with the vertices as points and arcs @xmath53 as arrows @xmath54 .",
    "we call @xmath55 the tail of @xmath53 , and @xmath56 the head",
    ". a path from @xmath57 to @xmath58 is a sequence @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for each @xmath63 . if @xmath64 , then the path is called a ( directed ) cycle .",
    "an important case of graphs is when @xmath65 is _ symmetric _ , _ i.e. _ , @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 . in such case",
    ", it is customary to identify the two pairs @xmath68 and @xmath53 with the set @xmath69 , and erase all the heads of the arrows in the drawing . when talking about a graph without specifying that it is directed , the symmetric situation is assumed .",
    "observe that this definition allows for loops edges ( where the tail and the head is the same ) , but not multiple edges . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that all graphs , both symmetric and directed , are without multiple edges and loops .      before studying matroids",
    ", we need a minimum of background on poset and lattice theory .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for more information on posets and lattices . the material in this section",
    "is used only in the technical work with the lattice of cyclic flats of matroids .",
