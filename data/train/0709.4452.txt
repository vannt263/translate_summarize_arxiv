    "for heavy quarks , their mass @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7@xmath8  mev ( critical temperature ) . hence their kinetic equilibration time",
    "is expected to be larger than that for light partons , thus showing better sensitivity to the in - medium interactions . due to a slower thermalization a smaller elliptic flow of @xmath2 mesons , @xmath9 ,",
    "was expected ; however , it was suggested that a sizable @xmath9 could result from that of the light quarks  @xcite through a coalescence hadronization mechanism  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , data from the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) for single electrons ( @xmath10 ) associated with semileptonic @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays in semi - central au - au collisions exhibited a @xmath11 of up to 10@xmath12  @xcite , indicating substantial collective behavior of charm ( @xmath13 ) quarks consistent with the assumption of a @xmath13-quark @xmath11 similar to the one for light quarks , apart from a @xmath14 shift due to radial - flow effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nuclear suppression factor was found to be comparable to the pion one , @xmath15@xmath70.3 @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations of radiative energy loss can not explain these findings , even after inclusion of elastic scattering .",
    "based on lattice qcd ( lqcd ) results which suggest resonance structures in the meson - correlation function at moderate temperatures , an effective model for heavy - light quark scattering via @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances was suggested @xcite .",
    "when implementing such a picture into a langevin simulation the results for semileptonic @xmath10 spectra @xcite are in reasonable agreement with rhic data @xcite .",
    "we employ a fokker - planck approach to evaluate drag and diffusion coefficients for @xmath13 and @xmath16 quarks in the qgp based on elastic scattering with light quarks via @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson resonances with a width @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19-@xmath20  mev ( supplemented by perturbative interactions )  @xcite .",
    "heavy - quark ( hq ) kinetics in the qgp is treated as a relativistic langevin process  @xcite , and the medium is modeled by a spatially homogeneous elliptic thermal fireball which expands isentropically .    for rhic the details of the fireball and",
    "the parameters used can be found in @xcite ; for lhc we extrapolate to @xmath21@xmath71400 for central @xmath22=5.5  tev pb - pb collisions .",
    "the expansion parameters are adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations , resulting in a total lifetime of @xmath23@xmath76  fm / c at the end of a hadron - gas qgp mixed phase and an inclusive light - quark elliptic flow of @xmath24=7.5% .",
    "the main change with respect to rhic is the expectation of a new `` phase '' in which hadron - like resonances melt at higher temperature . in order to implement this `` melting '' of @xmath2- and @xmath3-mesons above @xmath25=@xmath26@xmath7360  mev",
    ", a `` transition factor '' @xmath27)^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath28=50  mev ) has been introduced into the transport coefficients .",
    "initial hq spectra are computed using pythia with parameters as used by the alice collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath13 and @xmath16 quarks are hadronized into @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons at @xmath6 by coalescence with light quarks  @xcite ; `` left - over '' heavy quarks are treated by @xmath29-function fragmentation .",

    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] the invariant @xmath14 distributions for @xmath13 ( red ) and @xmath16 ( blue ) quarks at rhic ( left ) and lhc ( right ) are shown .",
    "it is evident that the charm - quark distributions after rescattering in the sqgp ( band corresponding to the uncertainty in the resonance width ) are close to the thermal distribution for @xmath14@xmath30@xmath31 where most of the yield resides . on the contrary , @xmath16 quarks are predicted to be off - equilibrium ( even at lhc energies ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] summarizes our results for hq diffusion in a qgp in terms of the meson @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath16=7  fm pb - pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "our most important findings are : ( a ) resonance interactions substantially increase ( decrease ) @xmath11 ( @xmath15 ) compared to perturbative interactions ; ( b ) @xmath16 quarks are much less affected than @xmath13 quarks , reducing the effects in the @xmath34 spectra ; ( c ) there is a strong correlation between a large @xmath11 and a small @xmath15 at the quark level , which , however , is partially reversed by coalescence contributions which increase _ both _ @xmath11 and @xmath15 at the meson ( and @xmath34 ) level .",
    "this feature turned out to be important in the prediction of @xmath34 spectra at rhic ; ( d ) the predictions for lhc are quantitatively rather similar to our rhic results  @xcite , due to a combination of harder initial hq-@xmath14 spectra ( see circles in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and a decrease in interaction strength in the early phases where non - perturbative resonance scattering is inoperative . therefore we conclude that if at rhic the dominant contribution to hq interactions are hadron - like resonances , at lhc we should observe an @xmath15 and @xmath11 pattern similar to rhic .",
