    "relativistic stellar models have been studied ever since the first solution of einstein s field equation for the interior of a compact object in hydrostatic equilibrium was obtained by schwarzschild in 1916 .",
    "the search for the exact solutions describing static isotropic and anisotropic stellar type configurations has continuously attracted the interest of physicists .",
    "the study of general relativistic compact objects is of fundamental importance for astrophysics .",
    "after the discovery of pulsars and explanation of their properties by assuming them to be rotating neutron stars , the theoretical investigation of superdense stars has been done using both numerical and analytical methods and the parameters of neutron stars have been worked out by general relativistic treatment .",
    "there are very few exact interior solutions ( both isotropic and anisotropic ) of the gravitational field equations satisfying the required general physical conditions inside the star . from @xmath0 published solutions analyzed in delgaty and lake ( 1998 ) only @xmath1 satisfy all the conditions .",
    "but the study of the interior of general relativistic stars via finding exact solutions of the field equations is still an active field of research . hence recently",
    "an algorithm was proposed by fodor ( 2000 ) to generate any number of physically realistic pressure and density profiles for spherical perfect fluid isotropic distributions without evaluating integrals .",
    "the gravitational field equations for static stellar models with a linear barotropic equation of state nilsson and uggla ( 2001b ) and with a polytropic equation of state nilsson and uggla ( 2001a ) @xmath2 were recast respectively into two complementary 3-dimensional regular system of ordinary differential equation on compact state space , these systems were analyzed numerically and qualitatively , using the theory of dynamical system .",
    "schmidt and homann ( 2000 ) discussed numerical solutions of einstein s field equation describing static spherically symmetric conglomerations of a photon star with an equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "recently upper limits for the mass - radius ratio are derived for compact general relativistic objects in the presence of a cosmological constant ( mak , dobson and harko 2000 ) and in the presence of a charge distribution ( mak , dobson and harko 2001 ) .    since the pioneering work of bowers and liang ( 1974 ) there is an extensive literature devoted to the study of anisotropic spherically symmetric static general relativistic configurations .",
    "the theoretical investigations of ruderman ( 1972 ) about more realistic stellar models show that the nuclear matter may be anisotropic at least in certain very high density ranges ( @xmath4 ) , where the nuclear interactions must be treated relativistically . according to these views in such massive stellar objects",
    "the radial pressure may not be equal to the tangential one . no celestial body is composed of purely perfect fluid .",
    "anisotropy in fluid pressure could be introduced by the existence of a solid core or by the presence of type @xmath5 superfluid ( kippenhahm and weigert 1990 ) , different kinds of phase transitions ( sokolov 1980 ) , pion condensation ( sawyer 1972 ) or by other physical phenomena . on the scale of galaxies , ( binney and tremaine 1987 )",
    "have considered anisotropies in spherical galaxies , from a purely newtonian point of view .",
    "the mixture of two gases ( e.g. , monatomic hydrogen , or ionized hydrogen and electrons ) can formally be also described as an anisotropic fluid ( letelier 1980 , bayin 1982 ) .",
    "bowers and liang ( 1974 ) have investigated the possible importance of locally anisotropic equations of state for relativistic fluid spheres by generalizing the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium to include the effects of local anisotropy .",
    "their study shows that anisotropy may have non - negligible effects on such parameters as maximum equilibrium mass and surface redshift .",
    "heintzmann and hillebrandt ( 1975 ) studied fully relativistic , anisotropic neutron star models at high densities by means of several simple assumptions and have shown that for arbitrary large anisotropy there is no limiting mass for neutron stars , but the maximum mass of a neutron star still lies beyond @xmath6 .",
    "hillebrandt and steinmetz ( 1976 ) considered the problem of stability of fully relativistic anisotropic neutron star models .",
    "they derived the differential equation for radial pulsations and showed that there exists a static stability criterion similar to the one obtained for isotropic models .",
    "anisotropic fluid sphere configurations have been analyzed , using various ansatze , in bayin ( 1982 ) , cosenza , herrera , esculpi and witten ( 1981 ) and harko and mak ( 2000 ) . for static spheres in which the tangential pressure differs from the radial one , bondi ( 1992 )",
    "has studied the link between the surface value of the potential and the highest occurring ratio of the pressure tensor to the local density .",
    "chan , herrera and santos ( 1993 ) studied in detail the role played by the local pressure anisotropy in the onset of instabilities and they showed that small anisotropies might in principle drastically change the stability of the system .",
    "herrera and santos ( 1995 ) have extended the jeans instability criterion in newtonian gravity to systems with anisotropic pressures .",
    "recent reviews on isotropic and anisotropic fluid spheres can be found in delgaty and lake ( 1998 ) and herrera and santos ( 1997 ) .",
    "very recently an analysis based on the weyl tensor of the lemaitre - schwarzschild problem of finding the equilibrium conditions of an anisotropically sustained spherical body under its relativistic gravitational field has been revisited by fuzfa , gerard and lambert ( 2001 ) . hernandez and nunez ( 2001 ) presented a general method for obtaining static anisotropic spherically symmetric solutions satisfying a nonlocal equation of state from known density profiles , by assuming the condition of a vanishing weyl tensor .",
    "this condition can be integrated in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "then , the resulting expression is used by herrera , prisco , ospino and fuenmayor ( 2001 ) to find new , conformally flat , interior solutions to einstein equations for locally anisotropic fluid .",
    "dev and gleiser ( 2000 ) presented several exact solutions for anisotropic stars of constant density .",
    "some classes of exact solutions of einstein field equations describing spherically and static anisotropic stellar type configurations were presented by harko and mak ( 2002 ) and mak , dobson and harko ( 2001 ) .",
    "the surface redshift @xmath7 of anisotropic realistic stars has been investigated by ivanov ( 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath7 can not exceed the values @xmath8 or @xmath9 , when the tangential pressure satisfies the strong or dominant energy conditions , respectively .",
    "in the present paper we consider a class of exact solutions of the gravitational field equations for an anisotropic fluid sphere , corresponding to a specific choice of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the metric functions can be represented in a closed form in terms of elementary functions .",
    "all the physical parameters like the energy density , pressure and metric tensor components are regular inside the anisotropic star , with the speed of sound less than the speed of light . therefore this solution can give a satisfactory description of realistic astrophysical compact objects like neutron stars .",
    "some explicit numerical models of relativistic anisotropic stars , with a possible astrophysical relevance , are also presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present an exact class of solutions for an anisotropic fluid sphere . in section",
    "iii we present neutron star models with possible astrophysical applications . the results are summarized and discussed in section iv .",
    "in standard coordinates @xmath10 , the general line element for a static spherically symmetric space - time takes the form @xmath11    einstein s gravitational field equations are ( where natural units @xmath12 have been used throughout ) : @xmath13    for an anisotropic spherically symmetric matter distribution the components of the energy - momentum tensor are of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the four - velocity @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the unit spacelike vector in the radial direction @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the energy density , @xmath20 is the pressure in the direction of @xmath17 ( normal pressure ) and @xmath21 is the pressure orthogonal to @xmath22 ( transversal pressure ) .",
    "we assume @xmath23 .",
    "the case @xmath24 corresponds to the isotropic fluid sphere .",
    "@xmath25 is a measure of the anisotropy and is called the anisotropy factor herrera and ponce de leon ( 1985 ) .",
    "a term @xmath26 appears in the conservation equations @xmath27 , ( where a semicolon @xmath28 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the metric ) , representing a force that is due to the anisotropic nature of the fluid .",
    "this force is directed outward when @xmath29 and inward when @xmath30 .",
    "the existence of a repulsive force ( in the case @xmath29 ) allows the construction of more compact objects when using anisotropic fluid than when using isotropic fluid ( gokhroo and mehra 1994 ) .    for the metric ( 2.1 )",
    "the gravitational field equations ( 2.2 ) become @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 .    to simplify calculations",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following substitutions : @xmath34    @xmath35 represents the total mass content of the distribution within the fluid sphere of radius @xmath36 .",
    "hence , we can express ( 2.5 ) in the equivalent form @xmath37    for any physically acceptable stellar models , we require the condition that the energy density is positive and finite at all points inside the fluid spheres . in order to have a monotonic decreasing energy density @xmath38 inside the star we chose the function @xmath39 in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are non - negative constant .",
    "( 2.8 ) represents an ansatz for the mass function , which has been previously used in the study of the isotropic fluid spheres by matese and whitman ( 1980 ) and finch and skea ( 1989 ) .",
    "we also introduce a new variable @xmath44 by means of the transformation @xmath45    we also chose the anisotropy parameter as @xmath46 where @xmath47 or equivalently @xmath48 and @xmath49 a constant . in the following we assume @xmath50 , with @xmath51 corresponding to the isotropic limit .",
    "hence @xmath52 can be considered , in the present model , as a measure of the anisotropy of the pressure distribution inside the fluid sphere . at the center of the fluid sphere",
    "the anisotropy vanishes , @xmath53 . for small @xmath36 the anisotropy parameter increases and , after reaching a maximum in the interior of the star , it becomes a decreasing function of the radial distance .    therefore with this choice of @xmath54 , ( 2.7 ) becomes a hypergeometric equation , @xmath55    by introducing the substitution @xmath56 , ( 2.11 ) reduces to a standard second order differential equation given by @xmath57    by means of the pair of transformations ( gupta and jasim 2000 ) @xmath58 ( 2.12 ) reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "we shall not present here a simple linear solution for @xmath61 corresponding to @xmath62 .",
    "for nonzero @xmath63 and with the use of the general solution of ( 2.14 ) , ( 2.13 ) becomes @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are arbitrary constants of integration .    in view of ( 2.12 ) and",

    "there are two ranges for these parameters making the physical requirements mathematically consistent , and they are given by : ( i ) @xmath134 and @xmath135 and ( ii ) @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "when the thermonuclear sources of energy in its interior are exhausted , a spherical star begins to collapse under the influence of gravitational interaction of its matter content .",
    "the mass energy continues to increase and the star ends up as a compact relativistic cosmic object such as neutron star , strange star or black hole .",
    "important observational quantities for such objects are the surface redshift , the central redshift and the mass and radius of the star .    for a relativistic anisotropic star described by the solution presented in the previous section",
    "the surface redshift @xmath138 is given by @xmath139    the surface redshift is decreasing with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "hence , at least in principle , the study of redshift of light emitted at the surface of compact objects can lead to the possibility of observational detection of anisotropies in the internal pressure distribution of relativistic stars .",

    "however , caporaso and brecher ( 1979 ) claimed that @xmath160 does not represent the signal speed .",
    "if therefore this speed exceeds the speed of light , this does not necessary mean that the fluid is non - causal .",
    "but this argument is quite controversial and not all authors accept it glass ( 1983 ) .",
    "in the present paper we have presented the general solution of the gravitational field equations for an anisotropic static matter distribution . to derive the solution we have used two basic assumptions : the functional form of the mass function @xmath161 and a specific mathematical representation of the anisotropy parameter @xmath54 . in our model",
    "the anisotropy vanishes at the center of the star , reaching its maximum near the vacuum boundary.this behavior is similar , from a phenomenological point of view , with the behavior of the anisotropy parameter of boson stars ( dev & gleiser 2001 ) .",
    "boson stars are gravitationally bound macroscopic quantum states made of scalar bosons ( jetzer 1992 ) .",
    "they differ from the fermionic stars in that they are only prevented from collapsing gravitationally by the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "boson stars , described by non - interacting , massive scalar fields @xmath162 with non - zero spatial gradients are anisotropic objects , with @xmath163 .",
    "hence our @xmath54 has the same qualitative properties as the anisotropy parameter of boson stars .",
    "an other possible source of the anisotropy as described by ( 2.10 ) could be an anisotropic velocity distribution of the particles inside the star .",
    "most of the models of stellar structure assume that the equation of state is due to a single species of ideal noninteracting fermions , with an isotropic distribution of momenta . if , due to the presence of a magnetic field , convection , turbulence etc . the local velocity distribution is anisotropic , then the pressure distribution is also anisotropic . to evaluate this effect",
    "let us consider a spherical configuration of collisionless particles , which exhibit no net velocity flow .",
