    "the characterization of topological states of matter is a central topic in condensed - matter physics.@xcite a beautiful example is given by the altland - zirnbauer ( az ) table@xcite , which classifies topological insulators and superconductors depending on their dimensions and discrete symmetries.@xcite a 2d chern insulator , for example , is characterized by a @xmath3 invariant and relies on the absence of time - reversal ( @xmath0 ) symmetry.@xcite the presence of this symmetry is instead crucial for @xmath2 topological insulators that exhibit the quantum spin hall effect.@xcite in these topologically non - trivial insulators , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the topological invariant and the number of gapless modes localized at the edge , known as the bulk - boundary correspondence.@xcite in chern insulators the edge states are chiral , which means that they all propagate in the same direction , whereas topological @xmath0 invariant insulators exhibit helical edge states , with electrons of opposite spins counterpropagating at the sample boundaries .",
    "there are , however , insulators and semimetals , which are topologically trivial according to the az - table , although they generally do exhibit edge states .",
    "a natural question is then whether these `` _ trivial _ '' edge states are related to a topological invariant that exists in the presence of a discrete or continuous symmetry .",
    "for 2d chiral systems , for instance , the existence of zero - energy edge states can be inferred from a 1d winding number.@xcite this explains the origin of trivial edge states in a minimal tight - binding model for graphene .",
    "more recently , this symmetry has been used to predict edge states in single - layer black phosphorus ( sometimes also called phosphorene).@xcite however , this explanation is quite unsatisfactory for insulators and semimetals because we do not expect the presence of a chiral symmetry : both in graphene and black phosphorus , the next - nearest neighbor hopping breaks the chiral symmetry .    here , we reveal the importance of inversion ( @xmath1)-symmetry , which has been overlooked in previous studies . we demonstrate that the existence of edge states in 2d crystalline insulators without spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the presence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry is related to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath2 invariant .",
    "we then apply this result to a generic toy model , and elucidate the relation between the edge states and this topological invariant .",
    "moreover , we discuss the quantization of the edge charge in the absence of edge states . finally , we apply our results to single and bilayer black phosphorus .",

    "the red dashed line corresponds to the contour @xmath8 , whereas the solid line corresponds to @xmath9 , the blue circle denotes the contour @xmath10 , and the enclosed area @xmath11 is shown in yellow . ]",
    "let us consider a 2d crystalline insulator , described by a bloch hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "we assume negligible soc , such that we can model the system using spin - less fermions , for which @xmath13 . in the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 symmetry",

    "we will assign a topological invariant to the projected bloch hamiltonian @xmath18 , where @xmath19(@xmath20 ) denotes the momentum along ( perpendicular to ) the edge . to discuss the consequences of the constraints in eq .",
