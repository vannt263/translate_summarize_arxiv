    "in particular , the @xmath137 term involves the three - magnon physics and thus it is possible to probe the efimov effect with esr .",
    "when the system comes across the critical coupling where an efimov state of three magnons emerges from the scattering threshold , the linewidth of the single - magnon peak as a function of the external parameter is expected to show an additional peak structure caused by the three - magnon resonance on either side of the two - magnon resonance .",
    "this feature is in analogy with ultracold atom experiments where an atom loss peak caused by the three - atom or atom - dimer resonance has been used as a signature of the emergence of an efimov trimer.@xcite similarly , a pair of universal four - magnon states associated with every efimov state@xcite may be observed with esr through an additional peak structure in the linewidth at @xmath138 caused by the four - magnon resonance.@xcite besides such characteristic behaviors in the single - magnon peak , we expect an additional structure in the esr spectrum at @xmath139 when @xmath23 magnons form a bound state with binding energy @xmath140 .",
    "this structure shows a threshold singularity at @xmath141 as @xmath142 , which may be used to measure binding energies of magnon efimov states .",
    "therefore , esr is a powerful experimental technique to investigate the interaction among magnons and their spectrum .",
    "so far we considered ferromagnetic spin systems where the single - magnon dispersion relation has a minimum at zero momentum . on the other hand , it is also possible to induce the two - magnon resonance and thus the magnon efimov effect in spin systems with antiferromagnetic or frustrated exchange couplings where the single - magnon dispersion relation has a minimum at nonzero momentum.@xcite in these cases , however , the sharp signature of magnon scattering resonances discussed in this article will not appear in esr because it measures the spectrum only at zero momentum .",
    "therefore , different experimental techniques such as inelastic neutron scattering that can scan momentum space should be used to probe magnon scattering resonances .",
