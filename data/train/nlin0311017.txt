    "<S> simple analytic considerations are applied to recently discovered patterns in a generalized fisher equation for population dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the generalization consists of the inclusion of non - local competition interactions among individuals . </S>",
    "<S> we first show how stability arguments yield a condition for pattern formation involving the ratio of the pattern wavelength and the effective diffusion length of the individuals . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a mode - mode coupling analysis which might be useful in shedding some light on the observed formation of small - amplitude versus large - amplitude patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown recently that the fisher equation used frequently for investigations of biological or ecological systems , when generalized to include spatially non - local competition interactions , leads to interesting patterns in the steady state density @xcite . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to shed some analytic light on the formation of these patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the original fisher equation @xcite is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the population density of individuals under investigation ( bacteria , rodents , etc . ) at position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are , respectively , the diffusion coefficient , population growth rate , and competition parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the generalized equation @xcite features competition interactions linking @xmath7 at point @xmath2 with @xmath8 at point @xmath9 through an influence function @xmath10 of range @xmath11 ,    @xmath12    @xmath13 being the domain for the non - local interaction .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the introduction of the finite - range competition interactions gives rise to the emergence of patterns in the steady state density @xmath14 with the following features :    * no patterns appear @xcite in the two extremes of zero range ( in which the generalization reverts to the fisher equation ) and full range ( in which the population density is linked equally to all points in the domain ) . </S>",
    "<S> * the pattern structure depends crucially on features of the influence function , specifically , its cut - off length and its width . * </S>",
    "<S> even when patterns appear , their steady - state amplitude can change abruptly from substantial to negligible as the parameters of the system are varied . </S>",
    "<S> * the critical quantity determining the separation of large - amplitude patterns from small - amplitude ones appears to be the ratio of the cut - off length of the influence function to its width .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings raise two questions . why do the patterns form at all ? and </S>",
    "<S> , what causes the separation of the large - amplitude patterns from the small - amplitude ones ? </S>",
    "<S> both questions are interesting . </S>",
    "<S> the first is amenable to understanding via standard stability analysis considerations . </S>",
    "<S> the second is more difficult but might be approachable through a mode - mode coupling analysis , as we show below .    in order to address the first question , </S>",
    "<S> consider a 1-dimensional version of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ influeq ] ) for simplicity , and substitute in it @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the homogeneous steady - state solution @xmath17 . considering periodic boundary conditions , and retaining only first order terms in @xmath18 , we obtain the following dispersion relation between the wavenumber @xmath19 of any mode of the pattern and the rate @xmath20 at which it tends to grow : @xmath21 in this expression , the influence function ( assumed to be even ) is represented by its cosine ( fourier ) transform @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 stable steady - state patterns require that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wavelength associated with the @xmath26mode of the fourier expansion of the pattern .    condition ( [ condinest ] ) allows us to check for the existence or absence of inhomogeneity , i.e. , patterns , in the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we see from ( [ condinest ] ) that the fourier transform of the influence function at the wavelength under consideration should be _ negative _ for the patterns to appear and that its magnitude should be large enough . </S>",
    "<S> one way of understanding this condition is to recast it as requiring that @xmath27 times the ` effective diffusion length ' should be smaller than the wavelength for the patterns to occur . by the effective diffusion constant is meant @xmath4 divided by @xmath28 , which is a factor decided by the influence function , and by the diffusion length is meant the distance traversed diffusively in a time interval of the order of the inverse of the growth rate . </S>",
    "<S> if the influence function is smooth such as in the case of a gaussian in an infinite domain , the fourier transform is positive and no patterns appear . </S>",
    "<S> a cut - off in the influence function produces oscillations in the fourier transform which can go negative for certain wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the reported finding @xcite that the cut - off nature is essential to pattern formation can be understood naturally in this way .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider , in turn , three cases of the influence function which we have used in our earlier investigations @xcite : square , cut - off gaussian , and intermediate .    first we take @xmath29\\theta [ w+(x - y)]\\ } , \\label{influsq}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the heaviside function . </S>",
    "<S> the influence function is thus a square of cut - off range measured by @xmath31 from its center . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the case here when the range @xmath31 is smaller than , or equal to , the domain length @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ alge ] ) then involves an integral from @xmath33 to @xmath31 , and gives @xmath34 in terms of dimensionless parameters @xmath35 we have @xmath36 which we plot in fig . 1 for three different values ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) of the ratio @xmath40 of the width to the diffusion length ( not _ effective _ diffusion length ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the third case there are no patterns : diffusion is strong enough to wash them out . for the intermediate case , patterns can occur with wavelengths corresponding to values around @xmath41 while for the @xmath42 case , they occur around @xmath43 .     </S>",
    "<S> +    the earlier finding @xcite that no patterns appear for extremes of the range of the influence function is clear from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dimless ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the influence width vanishes , i.e. , as @xmath40 goes to zero , both terms in @xmath20 are negative and there can be no steady state patterns : we recover the solution for the local limit , corresponding to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ originaleq ] ) , when @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> since the boundary conditions are periodic in a domain of length @xmath32 , there are only the allowed values @xmath45 of the wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the opposite limit of full range , i.e. , @xmath46 , the sine term vanishes , @xmath47 , and again there are no patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> precisely the same qualitative behavior occurs for other non - square influence functions such as the gaussian with a cut - off , i.e. , for @xmath48.\\ ] ] we again consider the case when the cut - off length does not exceed the domain length . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the fourier transform of the influence function involving an integral from @xmath33 to @xmath31 . in these as well as other cases considered </S>",
    "<S> , it should be appreciated that the domain length @xmath32 , if taken to be smaller than the cut - off length , becomes itself the cut - off length : factors such as @xmath49 appearing in the fourier transform become then @xmath50 instead .    for this </S>",
    "<S> cut - off gaussian case , the square case dispersion relation ( [ omega ] ) is replaced by @xmath51}{2\\mbox{erf}(w/\\sigma ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left [ \\mbox{erf}\\left(\\frac{w}{\\sigma}-\\frac{ik\\sigma}{2}\\right)+\\mbox{erf}\\left(% \\frac{w}{\\sigma } + \\frac{ik\\sigma}{2}\\right)\\right ] -dk^{2}. \\nonumber \\label{gaussdisp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dimensionless version ( [ dimless ] ) is replaced by @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the ratios of the cut - off length to the range and of the range to the diffusion length respectively : @xmath55 what is analogous to @xmath40 in the square case is their product @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> plots which are essentially the same as those in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 can be drawn for this gaussian case .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that , while there is a single quantity @xmath40 in the square case , there are two quantities , @xmath53 and @xmath57 , in the cut - off gaussian case . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the fact that , although there are generally two lengths associated with any influence function , the cut - off length and the width , the latter is infinite for the square case . </S>",
    "<S> the width has been defined in ref . @xcite as being inversely proportional to the second derivative of the influence function evaluated at its central point , and has been denoted by the symbol @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off length measures the distance beyond which the influence function is exactly zero and has been denoted @xcite by @xmath59 . for the cut - off gaussian , this @xmath60 . the symbol @xmath61 has been used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xmath31 in the present note . </S>",
    "<S> the width @xmath58 obeys @xmath62 for the gaussian case and @xmath63 for the square case .    </S>",
    "<S> both the cut - off gaussian and the square can be obtained as particular cases of a general function @xcite which we call the _ intermediate _ influence function : @xmath64^{1/r } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\{\\theta [ w-(x - y)]\\theta [ w+(x - y)]\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath65 the intermediate influence function goes to the cut - off gaussian , while for @xmath66 it yields he square function . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off length of the influence function is given by @xmath67 we will follow the notation @xmath68 and evaluate the fourier transform of the influence function by calculating the integral @xcite @xmath69 ^{\\nu -\\frac{1}{2}}ds\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left ( \\frac{2}{k w}\\right)^{\\nu } \\gamma(\\nu+1)j_{\\nu}(kw ) , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath70>\\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ] @xmath71 and @xmath72 being the gamma and the bessel functions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless dispersion relation analogous to ( [ dimless ] ) is , for this general case , @xmath73 here , as in the square case , @xmath74 is the ratio of the influence function width to the diffusion length .     </S>",
    "<S> +    it is straightforward to obtain the two limits , square and gaussian , from this dispersion result ( [ drtsallis ] ) for the intermediate influence function . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we plot the intermediate case for @xmath75 and see the same general behavior as in the gaussian and the square counterparts ( see , e.g. , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> steady state patterns appear only around @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> having understood the appearance of the patterns , we now come to the second issue mentioned in the introduction : the transition from small - amplitude to large - amplitude patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is much more difficult to address analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a procedure that we believe has the potential to shed some light on this issue . </S>",
    "<S> we substitute the fourier mode expansion of @xmath77 , @xmath78 in ( [ influeq ] ) , explicitly noting that @xmath79 , and using the orthogonality properties of trigonometric functions , obtain separate equations for the @xmath80 mode , @xmath81 and for other modes @xmath82 : @xmath83    \\nonumber \\\\ & & -b\\,\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\frac{a_{j}a_{n - j}}{2}\\mathcal{f}(k_{j } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -b\\,\\sum_{j = n+1}^{\\infty } \\frac{a_{j}a_{j - n}}{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left [ \\mathcal{f}(k_{j})+\\mathcal{f}(k_{j - n})\\right ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ amplitude0 ] ) and ( [ amplituden ] ) are the complete set of equations for the evolution of the amplitudes of all modes in the non - local problem given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ influeq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of stable patterns only for those values of @xmath84 for which @xmath20 is positive as seen in our figs . 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> , suggests that we envisage an interaction between _ only two modes _ , the zero mode and the one whose growth we examine , say @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> in a situation as in the plots shown in which @xmath86 only for a small @xmath26 range , the discrete nature of the allowed @xmath19 values could lead to only a single non - zero mode lying in the stable range . </S>",
    "<S> then we would have only two coupled nonlinear equations for the mode amplitudes , @xmath87 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which lead , in the steady state , to @xmath88 }    \\\\ a_{m}^{2}&=&-2\\left[\\frac{ba_{0}^{2}-aa_{0}}{b\\mathcal{f}(k_{m})}\\right].\\label{an}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substitution of the zero mode amplitude in @xmath89 gives an explicit expression for the latter : @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{twomode}\\ ] ]    preliminary investigations lead us to believe that the appearance of small and large amplitude patterns for different parameter regimes might emerge from considerations of ( [ twomode ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two - mode approach is , however , plagued by the fact that variation of the parameters of the system can make the approach invalid in one regime even if it is valid in another . </S>",
    "<S> surely steady state pattern amplitudes can always be obtained by a simultaneous solution of the algebraic equations obtained by putting the left side of ( [ amplitude0 ] ) and ( [ amplituden ] ) to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this is a straightforward numerical task if we can make the reasonable assumption that the number of modes to be considered has a finite cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> such a cut - off is an obvious consequence of the fact the fourier transform of a typical influence function disappears for high values of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> these and related studies will be reported in the future . </S>"
