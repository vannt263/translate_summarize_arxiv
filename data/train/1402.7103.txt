    "however , many questions exist concerning how the gas and dust in the disk evolve into a planetary system . observations of t tauri stars ( tts ) may provide insights into these questions , and a subset of tts , the `` transitional disks , '' have gained increasing attention in this regard .",
    "the unusual seds of transitional disks ( which feature infrared excess deficits ) may indicate that they have developed significant radial structure .",
    "transitional disk seds were first identified by @xcite from near - infrared ( nir ) ground - based photometry and iras mid - infrared ( mir ) photometry .",
    "these systems exhibited small nir and@xmath0or mir excesses , but significant mid- and far - ir ( fir ) excesses indicating that the _ dust _ distribution of these disks had an inner hole ( i.e. , a region that is mostly devoid of small dust grains from a radius r@xmath1 down to the central star ) .",
    "they proposed that these disks were in transition from objects with optically thick disks that extend inward to the stellar surface ( i.e. , class ii objects ) to objects where the disk has dissipated ( i.e. , class iii objects ) , possibly as a result of some phase of planet formation .",
    "a few years later , @xcite proposed that such transitional disk seds were consistent with the expectations for a disk subject to tidal effects exerted by companions , either stars or planets .",
    "more detailed studies of transitional disks became possible as increasingly sophisticated instruments became available .",
    "the spectrographs on board _ iso _ were able to study the brightest stars and @xcite inferred a large hole in the disk of the herbig ae@xmath0be star hd  100546 based on its sed .",
    "usage of the term `` transitional disk '' gained substantial momentum in the literature after the _ spitzer space telescope _",

    "also , it has not yet been confirmed if these clearings detected in the dust disk are present in the gas disk as well .",
    "the combination of these dust cavities with the presence of continuing gas accretion onto the central star is a challenge to theories of disk clearing .",
    "the distinct seds of ( pre-)transitional disks have lead many researchers to conclude that these objects are being caught in an important phase in disk evolution .",

    "even if companions are not responsible for the clearings seen in all ( pre-)transitional disks , these objects still have the potential to inform our understanding of how disks dissipate , primarily by providing constraints for disk clearing models involving photoevaporation and grain growth .    in this chapter",

    "we also review ir variability in ( pre-)transitional disks (   2.4 ) and gas observations (   2.5 ) . in  3 , we turn the observations from  2 into constraints for the main disk clearing mechanisms proposed to date ( i.e. , photoevaporation , grain growth , and companions ) and discuss these mechanisms in light of these constraints . in  4 , we examine the demographics of ( pre-)transitional disks ( i.e. , frequencies , timescales , disk masses , accretion rates , stellar properties ) in the context of disk clearing and in  5 we conclude with possibilities for future work in this field .",
    "in the two decades following @xcite s identification of the first transitional disks using nir and mir photometry , modeling of the seds of these disks , enabled largely by _ spitzer _ irs , inferred the presence of holes and gaps that span several au (   2.1 ) .",

    "we note that disks with holes have also been referred to as cold disks @xcite or weak excess transitional disks @xcite , but here we use the term `` transitional disks .

    "once that occurs , the inner disk can rapidly accrete onto the star , leaving behind a large ( and potentially growing ) hole at the disk center .",

    "however , for the subsample of ( pre-)transitional disks that have been studied in detail , the combination of large sizes and tenuous ( but non - negligible ) contents of the inner disks (   2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 ) , substantial accretion rates (   4.2 ) , and relatively low x - ray luminosities (   4.3 ) indicate that photoevaporation does not seem to be a viable mechanism for the depletion of their inner disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it has been shown both theoretically and observationally that a stellar - mass companion can open a gap in a disk .",

    "we focus our efforts on discussing dynamical clearing by planets",
    ". a confirmed detection of a planet in a disk around a young star does not yet exist .",
    "therefore , it is less clear if dynamical clearing by planets is at work in some or most ( pre-)transitional disks . given the challenges in detecting young planets in disks , the best we can do at present is theoretically explore what observational signatures would be present if there were indeed planets in disks and to test if this is consistent with what has been observed to date , as we will do in the following subsections .    _ maintaining gas accretion across holes and gaps _    a serious challenge for almost all theoretical disk clearing models posed to date is the fact that some ( pre-)transitional disks exhibit large dust clearings while still maintaining significant gas accretion rates onto the star . compared to other disk clearing mechanisms ( see   3.1 ) , gap opening by planets can more easily maintain gas accretion across the gap since the gravitational force of a planet can `` pull '' the gas from the outer disk into the inner disk .",
    "the gap s depth and the gas accretion rate across the gap are closely related .",
    "the disk accretion rate at any radius @xmath57 is defined as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the gas surface density and radial velocity at @xmath57 .",
    "if we further assume @xmath61=@xmath62@xmath63 and the accretion rate across the gap is a constant , the flow velocity is accelerated by about a factor of 100 in a gap which is a factor of 100 in depth .    in a slightly more realistic picture , @xmath64=@xmath62@xmath65 breaks down within the gap since the planet - disk interaction is highly asymmetric in the r-@xmath66 2-d plane . inside of the gap",
    ", the flow only moves radially at the turnover of the horseshoe orbit , which is very close to the planet .",
    "this high velocity flow can interact with the circumplanetary material , shock with and accrete onto the circumplanetary disk , and eventually onto the protoplanet @xcite .",
    "due to the great complexity of this process , the ratio between the accretion onto the planet and the disk s accretion rate across the gap is unclear .",
    "thus , we will parameterize this accretion efficiency onto the planet as @xmath67 . after passing the planet ,",
    "the accretion rate onto the star is only @xmath68 of the accretion rate of the case where no planet is present .",
    "note that this parameterization assumes that the planet mass is larger than the local disk mass so that the planet migration is slower than the typical type ii rate . for a disk with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the local disk mass is 1.5 @xmath71 at 20 au .",
    "@xcite carried out 3-d viscous hydrodynamic simulations with a sink particle as the planet and found a @xmath67 of 0.9 .",
    "@xcite carried out 2-d viscous hydro - simulations , but depleted the circumplanetary material at different timescales , and found that @xmath67 can range between 0.1 - 0.9 depending on the circumplanetary disk accretion timescale .",
    "the accretion efficiency onto the planet plays an essential role in the accretion rate onto the star .    _ explaining ir sed deficits _    regardless of the accretion efficiency , there is an intrinsic tension between significant gas accretion rates onto the star and the optically thin inner disk region in ( pre-)transitional disks .",
    "this is because the planet s influence on the accretion flow of the disk is limited to the gap region @xcite whose outer and inner edge hardly differ by a factor of more than 2 . after passing through the gap ,",
    "the inner disk surface density is again controlled only by the accretion rate and viscosity ( e.g. , mhd turbulence ) , similar to a full disk .",
    "since a full disk s inner disk produces strong nir emission , it follows that transitional disks should also produce strong nir emission , but they do not .    with this simple picture",
    "it is very difficult to explain transitional disks , which have strong nir deficits , compared to pre - transitional disks . for example , the transitional disk gm aur has very weak nir emission .",

    "[ dynamic],width=8 ]    one possibility is that multiple planets are present in ( pre-)transitional disks .",
    "if multiple planets from 0.1 au to tens of au can open a mutual gap , the gas flow can be continuously accelerated and passes from one planet to another so that a low disk surface density can sustain a substantial disk accretion rate onto the star @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamical simulations have shown that each planet pair in a multiple planet system will move into 2:1 mean motion resonance @xcite . even in a case with four giant planets , with the outermost one located at 20 au ,",
    "the mutual gap is from 2 - 20 au @xcite .",
    "therefore , to affect the gas flow at 0.1 au , we need to invoke an even higher number of giant planets .    if there are multiple planets present in ( pre-)transitional disks , the planet accretion efficiency parameter ( @xmath67 ) can not be large in order to maintain a moderate accretion rate onto the star . with @xmath29 planets in the disk ,",
    "the accretion rate onto the star will be @xmath75 . if @xmath76 and the full disk has a nominal accretion rate @xmath77 , after passing two planets the accretion rate is 0.01@xmath3 10@xmath78=10@xmath79 which is already below the observed accretion rates in ( pre-)transitional disks ( see   4.2 ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath80 , even with four planets , the disk can still accrete at @xmath81",
    ". thus , @xmath67 is one key parameter in the multi - planet scenario , which demands further study .    _",
    "another possible solution : dust filtration _",
    "another possibility is that the small dust grains in the inner disk are highly depleted by physical removal or grain growth , to the point where the dust opacity in the nir is far smaller than the ism opacity .",
    "generally , this dust opacity depletion factor is @xmath210@xmath82 to 10@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "dust filtration is a promising mechanism to deplete dust to such a degree .",
    "dust filtration relies on the fact that dust and gas in disks are not perfectly coupled . due to gas drag",
    ", dust particles will drift towards a pressure maximum in a disk ( see chapter by _ johansen et al .",
    "_ in this volume ; * ? ?",
    "the drift speed depends on the particle size , and particles with the dimensionless stopping time @xmath84 drift fastest in disks .",

    "@xmath89 1 or 10 g @xmath48 , 1  cm particles have @xmath90 1 or 0.1 .",
    "thus , submm and cm observations are ideal to reveal the effects of particle drift in disks . at the outer edge of a planet - induced gap , where the pressure reaches a maximum , dust particles drift outwards , possibly overcoming their coupling to the inward accreting gas .",
    "dust particles will then remain at the gap s outer edge while the gas flows through the gap .",
    "this process is called `` dust filtration '' @xcite , and it depletes dust interior to the semi - major axis of the planet - induced gap , forming a dust - depleted inner disk .",
    "dust trapping at the gap edge was first simulated by @xcite .",
    "however , without considering particle diffusion due to disk turbulence , mm and cm sized particles will drift from tens of au into the star within 200 orbits .",
    "@xcite included particle diffusion due to disk turbulence in 2-d simulations evolving over viscous timescales , where a quasi - steady state for both gas and dust has been achieved , and found that micron sized particles are difficult to filter by a jupiter mass planet in a @xmath91 disk .",
    "@xcite has done 1-d calculations considering dust growth and dust fragmentation at the gap edge and suggested that micron - sized particles may also be filtered .",

    "thus transitional disks may have a higher mass planet(s ) than pre - transitional disks .",
    "since a higher mass planet exerts a stronger torque on the outer disk , it may slow down the accretion flow passing the planet and lead to a lower disk accretion rate onto the star .",
    "this is consistent with observations that transitional disks have lower accretion rates than pre - transitional disks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dust filtration can explain the observed differences in the relative distributions of micron sized dust grains and mm sized dust grains .",
    "disks where the small dust grains appear to closely trace the large dust distribution ( i.e. , category c disks from  2.3 ) could be in an advanced stage of dust filtration , after the dust grains in the inner disk have grown to larger sizes and can no longer be detected in nir scattered light .",
    "disks with nir scattered light imaging evidence for a significant amount of small , submicron sized dust grains within the cavities in the large , mm - sized dust grains seen in the submm ( i.e. , the category a and c disks from  2.3 ) , could be in an earlier stage of disk clearing via dust filtration .",
    "future observations will further our understanding of the many physical processes which can occur when a giant planet is in a disk , such as dust growth in the inner disk , dust growth at the gap edge @xcite , tidal stripping of the planets @xcite , and planets in the dead zone @xcite .",
    "in addition , here we have explored how to explain large holes and gaps in disks , yet there may be smaller gaps present in disks (   2.1 ) that may not be observable with current techniques .",

    "for example , the relative dearth of ( pre-)transitional disks around lower mass stars may reflect a decreased rate of giant planet formation , as would be expected given their typically smaller initial disk masses .    among other stellar properties ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity can provide further useful constraints .",
    "@xmath110 has been invoked as a major contributor to theoretical photoevaporation rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as accretion rates related to mri at the inner disk edge @xcite . examining the ( pre-)transitional disks in taurus and chamaleon i , @xcite found correlations between the size of the inner cleared regions and several stellar@xmath0disk properties including stellar mass , x - ray luminosity , and mass accretion rate .",
    "these possibly point to the mri or photoevaporation mechanisms .",
    "however , known independent correlations between stellar mass , @xmath110 , and mass accretion rate may also be responsible . in a follow - up study with a large sample of 62 ( pre-)transitional disks in orion",
    ", @xcite attempted to correct for the stellar mass dependences and found no residual correlation between accretion rate or @xmath110 and the size of the inner hole .",
    "the measured properties of most ( pre-)transitional disks do not overlap with the ranges of parameter space predicted by these models .",
    "@xcite concluded that the demographics of their sample are most consistent with giant planet formation being the dominant process responsible for creating ( pre-)transitional disk seds .    to better understand the connection between underlying physical mechanisms and observed disk demographics , more theoretical and observational work needs to be done .",
    "improved theoretical estimates on stellar ages , accretion efficiencies , and disk masses for different clearing mechanisms will aid in interpretation of the observations . at the same time , larger ground - based surveys are essential to confidently constrain basic properties such as stellar accretion rates , ages , and disk masses . in the near future ,",
    "the higher resolution of alma will reveal the extent of gaps in disks , leading to better statistics to measure the ( pre-)transitional disk frequency and the transition timescale .",
    "_ jwst _ will be key in addressing how the ( pre-)transitional frequency depends on age .",
    "the best constraints on disk demographics clearly require a multi - wavelength approach .",
    "it is thought that practically all stars have planets ( see chapter in this volume by _ fischer et al .",
    "if we start with the reasonable assumption that these planets formed out of disks , then the question is not if there are planets in disks around young stars , but what are their observable signatures . to date",
    "we have detected large , optically thin holes and gaps in the dust distribution of disks and theoretical planet clearing mechanisms can account for some of their observed properties . these ( pre-)transitional disks have captured the interest of many scientists since they may be a key piece of evidence in answering one of the fundamental questions in astronomy : how do planets form ?    while other disk clearing mechanisms ( e.g , grain growth , photoevaporation ;   3.1 ) should certainly be at play in most , if not all , disks ( and may even work more effectively in concert with planets ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here we speculate what kinds of planets could be clearing ( pre-)transitional disks , beginning with massive giant planets .",
    "if a massive giant planet ( or multiple planets ) is forming in a disk , it will cause a large cavity in the inner disk since it will be very efficient at cutting off the inner disk from the outer disk .",
    "this will lead to significant depletion of small and large dust grains in the inner disk and lower accretion onto the central star (   3.2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with ( pre-)transitional disks which have submm and nir scattered light cavities and mir deficits in the sed ( e.g. , lkca  15 , gm  aur , sz  91 , rx j1604 - 2130 ; ",
    "2.12.3 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the lower accretion rates measured for these objects (   4.2 ) .",
    "one caveat is that massive planets would be the easiest to detect , yet there has not been a robust detection of a protoplanet in a ( pre-)transitional disk yet .    a less massive planet ( or fewer planets ) would still lead to substantial clearing of the inner disk , but be less efficient at cutting off the inward flow of material from the outer disk (   3.2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with those ( pre-)transitional disks that have a submm cavity but no mir deficit in the sed , such as wsb  60 , indicating that small dust still makes it through into the inner disk (   2.12.3 ) .",
    "interestingly , wsb  60 is in oph and overall ( pre-)transitional disks seds are rare in this region . given that oph is quite young ( age @xmath51 myr ) , this may be indicative of the effects of dust evolution and@xmath0or planet growth .",
    "disks in oph could be in the initial stages of gap opening by planets whereas in older systems , the dust grains in the inner disk have grown to larger sizes and@xmath0or the planets have grown large enough to more efficiently disrupt the flow of material into the inner disk .",
    "the above suggests that most disks with planets go through a pre - transitional disk phase and that there are many disks with small gaps that have escaped detection with currently available techniques .",
    "more theoretical work is needed to explore if all pre - transitional disks eventually enter a transitional disk phase as planets grow more massive and the inner disk is accreted onto the star . note also that there are some disks which have submm cavities and mir sed deficits , but no evidence of clearing in nir scattered light ( e.g. , sr  21 , doar  44 , rx  j1615@xmath233255 ) .",
    "apparently , there is some important disk physics regarding accretion efficiencies that we are missing .",
    "it is necessary to study disks in other star forming regions with alma , both to probe a range of ages and to increase the statistical sample size , in order to address questions of this kind .",
    "detections of protoplanets would be ideal to test the link between planet mass and disk structure .",
    "while much progress has been made understanding the nature of the disks described above , future work may focus more closely on disks with smaller optically thin gaps that could plausibly be created by low - mass planets .",
    "the presence of low mass orbiting companions ( @xmath111 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expected to alter the dust disk significantly with little impact on the gas disk , whereas high mass companions ( @xmath112 ) can create gaps or holes in the gas disk and possibly alter its dynamics .",
    "_ kepler _ finds that super - earth mass objects are very common in mature planetary systems ( see chapter in this volume by _ fischer et al .",
    "_ ) , so it may be that smaller mass objects form fairly commonly in disks and open holes and gaps that are not cleared of dust . these systems are more difficult to identify with sed studies and current interferometers , so potentially there are many more disks with gaps than currently known",
    ". high spatial resolution images from alma will be able to detect these small gaps , in some cases even those with sizes down to about 3  au @xcite .",
    "there are many remaining avenues that researchers can take to fully characterize clearing in disks around tts .",
    "theoretically , we can simulate the influence of various mass planets on different sized dust particles , which can be compared with observations at various wavelengths to constrain a potential planet s mass .",
    "we can use alma , vlti , and jwst to test the full extent of disk holes and gaps as well as their frequency with respect to age .",
    "we can also make substantial progress studying the gas distributions in disks in the near future with alma , particularly to determine if the structure inferred for the disk from studies of the dust is the same as that in the gas .",
    "gas tracers may also reveal the presence of an orbiting planet via emission from a circumplanetary disk .",
    "lastly , and perhaps most importantly , we need robust detections of protoplanets in disks around young stars . these future advances will help us understand how gas@xmath0ice giant planets and terrestrial planets form out of disks and hopefully antiquate this review by the time of ppvii . +",

    "most important papers are those which addressed the issue of dust growth and mixing in t tauri disks . in @xcite",
    ", she showed that disk models with well - mixed dust with properties like that of the diffuse interstellar medium produced disks that were too vertically thick and produced too much infrared excess , while lacking sufficient mm - wave fluxes . in the second paper of the series",
    "@xcite paola and collaborators showed that models with power - law size distributions of dust with maximum sizes around 1 mm produced much better agreement with the mm and infrared emission of most t tauri disks , but failed to exhibit the 10 silicate emission feature usually seen , leading to the conclusion that the large grains must have settled closer to the midplane while leaving a population of small dust suspended in the upper disk atmosphere .",
    "this paper provided the first clear empirical evidence for the expected evolution of dust as a step in growing larger bodies in protoplanetary disks .",
    "another important result was the demonstration that once grain growth proceeds past sizes comparable to the wavelengths of observation , the spectral index of the disk emission is determined only by the size distribution of the dust , not its maximum .",
    "along with quantitative calculations of dust properties , the results imply that the typical opacities used to estimate dust masses will generally lead to underestimates of the total solid mass present , a point that is frequently forgotten or ignored .",
    "in the third paper of this series @xcite , paola and her collaborators developed models which incorporated a thin central layer of large dust along with depleted upper disk layers containing small dust .",
    "the code which developed these models has been used in over 30 papers to compare with observations , especially those from the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite as well as the irac camera @xcite on board the spitzer space telescope , and more recently from pacs on board the herschel space telescope @xcite , and from the sma @xcite .",
    "paola s models also played a crucial role in the recognition of transitional and pre - transitional t tauri disks @xcite . in many cases , particularly those of the pre - transitional disks , finding evidence for an inner hole or gap from the spectral energy distribution depends upon careful and detailed modeling .",
    "the inference of gaps and holes from the seds is now being increasingly confirmed directly by mm- and sub - mm imaging @xcite , showing reasonable agreement in most cases with the hole sizes predicted by the models .",
    "combining imaging with sed modeling in the future will place additional constraints on the properties of dust in protoplanetary disks .",
    "paola s influence in the community extended well beyond her direct contributions to the literature in over 100 refereed papers .",
    "she provided disk models for many other researchers as well as detailed dust opacities .",
    "the insight provided by her calculations informed many other investigations , as studies of x - ray heating of protoplanetary disk atmospheres @xcite , of the chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and propagation of high energy radiation @xcite and on the photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
