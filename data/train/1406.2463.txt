    "the currently accepted physical picture for the origin of the optical nebulosities around massive stars of early spectral type ( o , of , and wolf - rayet ( wr ) ) assumes that they are formed from the interaction of the stellar wind with circumstellar gas .",
    "the flow pattern , resulting from such an interaction , was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "these so called wind - blown bubbles ( wbb ) consist of two regions of shocked gas : the outer one is filled with the shocked circumstellar gas and the inner one ( the hot bubble ) harbours the shocked stellar wind .",
    "a contact discontinuity separates these regions and the plasma in the hot bubble can cool down due to the high efficiency of electron thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physics of the hot interior of a wbb is a cornerstone for the physical picture of these objects .",
    "the hot bubble is the place where the stellar wind energy is supplied and then used for driving the entire structure . because of the high velocity ( 1000 - 3000  km  s@xmath3 ) of the stellar winds of massive o and wr stars , and thus the high shock velocities in wbbs , the expected plasma temperatures are very high .",
    "therefore , wbbs are expected to emit x - rays and the key characteristic of their x - ray emission is that it should be spatially located _ inside _ the optical nebula .",
    "@xcite reported the first successful detection of x - rays from a wbb : the observation of ngc  6888 by _",
    "revealed hot plasma with a typical temperature of kt  @xmath4  kev ( 90% confidence interval ) .",
    "subsequent studies of this object with _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , _ asca _",
    "@xcite , _ chandra _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and _ suzaku _ @xcite provided further details about the x - ray emission from ngc  6888 and established that the plasma temperature of the hot bubble is kt  @xmath5  kev .",
    "the _ suzaku _ observations of ngc  6888 provided us with the first x - ray spectrum with good photon statistics of an entire wbb .",
    "its analysis gave the first observational evidence about the origin of the hot gas : the wbb interior is filled mostly by gas that flowed into the hot bubble from the optical nebula ( zhekov & park 2011 ) .",
    "this , along with the relatively low plasma temperature of the hot bubble , is a solid indication for efficient electron thermal conduction operating in wbbs .",
    "unfortunately , there are not many detections of x - ray emission from wbbs .",
    "there is only one more object , s308 , that has been detected and studied in some detail .",
    "analysis of the _ rosat _ @xcite and the _ xmm - newton  _ @xcite observations of s308 showed that its x - ray spectrum is soft with plasma temperature of kt  @xmath6  kev .",
    "recent analysis of new _ xmm - newton  _ observations that completed coverage of this wbb observed in x - rays to 90% of its spatial extent confirmed the basic properties of the hot plasma in s308 @xcite .",
    "it also provided evidence that the chemical composition of the hot gas is similar to that of the optical nebula which , as in the case of ngc  6888 , indicates that electron thermal conduction plays an important role for the physics of this object as well .",
    "apart from the two x - ray detections just mentioned , there are two reports in the literature of non - detections of wbbs in x - rays , namely , of the nebulae around the wr stars wr 16 @xcite and wr 40 @xcite .",
    "thus , any new data on the x - ray emission from wbbs are of great importance in helping us to better understand the physics of these objects .             in this paper , we report results from the _ xmm - newton  _ observation of the wbb ngc  2359 , the third object of this kind detected in x - rays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give some basic information about ngc  2359  in section  [ sec : ngc2359 ] . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we review the _ xmm - newton  _ observation . in section  [ sec : xray ] , we present results from analysis of the x - ray properties of ngc  2359  and the two brightest point sources within the optical nebula . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results and we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the nebula ngc  2359  around the wr star wr 7 is a classical wind - blown bubble with angular size of 4.5 arcmin @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocity of the nebula is not well constrained and a typical range for its value is 10 - 30  km  s@xmath3(see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to ngc  2359  ( wr 7 ) is d  @xmath7  kpc @xcite , thus , the dynamical age ( radius divided by the expansion velocity ) of the nebula is @xmath8  years . no x - ray detection of ngc",
    "2359  has been previously reported .",
    "the central star , wr 7 , is a wn4 star and the optical extinction toward it is a@xmath9  mag ( @xcite ; a@xmath10 a@xmath11 ) implying a foreground column density of n@xmath12  @xmath13 .",
    "the range corresponds to the conversion that is used : n@xmath14a@xmath11  @xmath13 ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; and n@xmath15a@xmath11  @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the stellar wind parameters ( velocity and mass loss ) of v@xmath16  km  s@xmath3and @xmath17  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "ngc  2359  was observed with _ xmm - newton  _ on 2013 apr 9 ( observation i d 0690390101 ) with a nominal exposure of @xmath19  ksec .",
    "because of the anticipated faint x - ray emission from ngc  2359 , our analysis is focused on the data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) having one pn and two mos detectors . for the data reduction , we made use of the _ xmm - newton  _ sas 12.0.1 data analysis software .",
    "for the analysis of the epic mos and pn observations , we also made use of the _ xmm - newton  _ extended source analysis software ( xmm - esas ) package , which is now incorporated in sas .    before proceeding with the spectral extraction",
    ", we verified that the studied object was detected .",
    "for that purpose , we constructed an x - ray image following the recipe described in the xmm - esas cookbook .",
    "first , we created filtered event files using the esas commands _ mos - filter _ and _ pn - filter _ which minimizes the contamination of the soft proton flaring in the epic data in a robust manner .",
    "the relatively strong point sources were excised as well .",
    "then , we constructed quiescent background spectra and images .",
    "we used the corresponding results and the xmm - esas command _",
    "adapt_900 _ to construct a combined epic background - subtracted and exposure - corrected image .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] presents the background - subtracted images of ngc  2359  in the soft ( 0.4 - 1.25 kev ) and hard ( 2.0 - 4.0 kev ) energy bands along with an optical image of the studied object .",
    "a minimum of 20 counts per bin were requested for the smoothed images .",
    "as seen from these results , soft x - ray emission is detected from ngc  2359 , and this emission originates from regions _ inside _ the optical nebula .",
    "for the analysis of the x - ray spectrum of ngc  2359 , we decided to adopt the standard approach ( i.e. , annular background subtraction ) instead of following the one described in the xmm - esas cookbook for strong extended sources .",
    "the reason is that the x - ray emission from the region of ngc  2359  is dominated by the background emission ( instrumental and cosmic ) .",
    "so , a global fit to the total x - ray emission that consists of various background components and the emission of ngc  2359  will simply ` wash out ' the spectral parameters of the latter . in addition , the ngc  2359  x - ray emission is of limited angular extent making an annular background spectrum reasonable .",
    "figure  [ fig : regions ] shows the x - ray image of ngc  2359  and the corresponding regions for the spectral extraction .",
    "we note that our basic background region is that denoted by the circular annulus .",
    "we do so as the x - ray spectrum from such a region could likely combine the spectral characteristics of the entire ngc  2359  background .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the other background regions are chosen as representative of different parts of the x - ray sky and of the x - ray detectors .",
    "the spectral extractions were done from the filtered event files ( see above ) having effective exposures of 64.5 ksec ( pn ) , 88.6 ksec ( mos1 ) and 92.8 ksec(mos2 ) .",
    "we used only the pn spectrum of ngc  2359  ( @xmath20 source counts ) since the mos spectra have considerably lower photon statistics due to the mos much lower effective area compared to that of the pn detector ( see  3.2.2 in the _ xmm - newton  _ users handbook : footnote@xmath21 ) .",
    "we extracted the x - ray spectra of the two brightest sources in the region of ngc  2359  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] ) : the central star of the nebula wr 7 and the hst gsc object s3xj067536 ( the gsc object coordinates are within 1.2 arcsec from the x - ray coordinates as derived from the _ xmm - newton  _ data , thus , we will denote this object as [ s3xj067536 ] ) .",
    "since the spectra of point sources are not background - dominated , we extracted a pn and two mos spectra for each object .",
    "the mos1 and mos2 spectra are practically identical which allowed us to construct a total ( combined ) mos spectrum for each point source .",
    "the resultant spectra of wr 7 had @xmath22  cts ( pn ) and @xmath23  cts ( mos ) , while those for [ s3xj067536 ] had @xmath24  cts ( pn ) and @xmath25  cts ( mos ) .    finally , we constructed response matrix files and ancillary response files for each spectrum by making use of the sas procedures _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ , respectively . for the case of ngc  2359",
    ", we followed the approach recommended for extended sources ( e.g. , by creating an image of the source region , see  4.8.5 in the sas users guide ) .",

    "a basic characteristic of the x - ray emission from ngc  2359  is that it is rather soft and there is no apparent emission at energies above 2 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) .",
    "we note that because of the relatively large spatial extent of the nebula and its weak x - ray emission , it is not possible to correct the background - subtracted spectrum for the instrumental al k@xmath26 line very well . for these reasons",

    "it is interesting to note that using the adopted stellar wind parameters and distance to wr 7 (   [ sec : ngc2359 ] ) , we derive for the x - ray and the wind luminosity l@xmath46  erg  s@xmath3   and l@xmath47  erg  s@xmath3 .",

    "one of the basic results from the analysis of the _ xmm - newton  _ data on ngc  2359  is that the x - ray emission of this wbb is rather soft and originates from a plasma with a relatively low temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wbbspec ] and table  [ tab : ngc2359 ] ) .",
    "as the stellar wind velocity is very high ( see   [ sec : ngc2359 ] ) , the expected shock velocity is high too , thus the postshock plasma temperature should be at least an order of magnitude larger than the value deduced from the analysis of the x - ray spectrum of ngc  2359 . in general , this is an indication of efficient electron thermal conduction operating in this object that could cause ` evaporation ' of the gas from the outer ( optical ) nebula into the hot bubble , thus , lowering the gas temperature in its interior ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    unfortunately , due to the low statistics of the spectrum , we were not able to fit for the abundances which could have helped us draw some conclusion about the origin of the hot gas in ngc  2359 .",
    "we recall that such an analysis was possible for another wbb ( ngc  6888 ) whose spectrum had a very good photon statistics .",
    "it provided the first observational evidence that the hot gas in ngc  6888 originates from the outer cold optical shell @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopted values typical for the optical nebula in the fits to the x - ray emission from ngc  2359  ( see   [ subsec : ngc2359 ] ) .",
    "however , a model fit to the spectrum of ngc  2359  was successful even if typical wn abundances @xcite were adopted for the hot gas in ngc  2359 .",
    "we note that this fit is also statistically acceptable , @xmath51/dof  @xmath52 , and the plasma temperature , kt  @xmath53 , is similar to that from the fit with abundances typical for the optical nebula ( see table  [ tab : ngc2359 ] ) .",
    "all this confirms that the limited photon statistics in the x - ray spectrum of ngc  2359  does not allow for deriving some valuable information about the elemental abundances in its hot interior .",
    "nevertheless , the low plasma temperature in ngc  2359 , a likely indication of efficient electron thermal conduction , motivates attempts to test the results from hydrodynamic modelling of wbb with the observations of ngc  2359 .    before doing this ,",
    "a few basic details of the physics of wbbs around massive stars are worth recalling .",
    "a wbb forms when the stellar wind of a massive star interacts with the circumstellar matter . in the case of wr stars ,",
    "the fast massive wind collides with the slow wind emitted in the previous stage of the wr evolution , i.e. , a rsg ( red supergiant ) or a lbv ( luminous blue variable ) wind .",
    "an important feature of such an interaction is that both gas flows have similar density profile ( @xmath54 ) which results in a structure ( wbb ) expanding with constant velocity .",
    "thus , the dynamical age of a wbb around a wr star is practically equal to its physical age .",
    "the basic physical quantities that determine the global characteristics of such a wbb are the mass - loss rates and velocities of the fast ( wr ) and the slow ( rsg or lbv ) winds . the fast wind parameters can be derived from analysis of the emission of the central star of a wr wbb in different spectral domains ( e.g. , uv , optical , radio ) . on the other hand , the slow wind characteristics are free input parameters for the hydrodynamic modelling , and observational properties to match in the ` startup ' modelling stage are the size and expansion velocity of the wbb .",
    "to derive the global characteristics of ngc  2359  and the physical parameters of its hot bubble , we used the hydrodynamic code of a.v .",
    "myasnikov that was developed for modelling the physics of a standard wbb ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "this code allows modelling not only of adiabatic and radiative wbb but also of the case with efficient thermal conduction .",
    "it correctly handles interacting gas flows with different chemical compositions .    for ngc  2359  ( see   [ sec : ngc2359 ] ) , the typical range of expansion velocity is 10 - 30  km  s@xmath3and its angular size corresponds to a linear radius of @xmath55  pc for the adopted distance of @xmath56  kpc to this object .",
    "the mass - loss rate and velocity of the fast stellar wind ( the wind of the central star wr 7 ) are correspondingly @xmath57  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  and v@xmath58  km  s@xmath3 . as to the slow wind parameters ( @xmath59 , v@xmath60 ) , we varied them in order to match the expansion velocity and the size of the nebula .",
    "we only recall that as the nebula is sweeping out through the material of the slow wind , the expansion velocity of the nebula sets an upper limit for the slow wind velocity .",
    "thus , we chose to run two sets of models with v@xmath61   5 and 10  km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : vexp ] presents the results for the expansion velocity of the nebula as derived from the numerical simulations for various values of the mass - loss ratio ( @xmath62 ) of the stellar winds .",
    "we see that values close to the observed ones are possible _ only _ for high mass - loss ratios : e.g. , @xmath63 . for the nominal value of the mass - loss rate of the fast wind of @xmath57  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3",
    ", this implies that the mass loss of the slow wind should be very high : @xmath64  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  .",
    "we have to keep in mind that the slow - wind phase in the evolution of the central star in a wbb should have lasted at least for a time period of @xmath65 , it should have found slow wind gas at the same distance from the star . ] , where @xmath66 is the age of the wbb and @xmath67 is its expansion velocity .",
    "given the dynamical age ( representative for the age of the nebula ) of @xmath68  years and the low expansion velocity as deduced from observations ( see   [ sec : ngc2359 ] ) , the standard physical picture of wbb suggests an unusually long slow - wind phase in the evolution of the central massive star in ngc  2359  with extremely high mass - loss rate .",
    "this also implies a very large total mass loss of _",
    "@xmath69  solar masses _",
    "we note that such an evolutionary phase does not seem to fit the standard evolutionary scenario for massive stars ( e.g. , see  2.3.1 in @xcite )",
    ".     5 ( triangles ) and 10  km  s@xmath3 ( diamonds ) , respectively . for both sets ,",
    "the fast wind parameters are @xmath57  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  and v@xmath58  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the two dashed lines mark the range of values deduced from observations : @xmath70  km  s@xmath3@xcite .",
    ", width=336,height=240 ]    to further check the physical picture of wbb in the case of ngc  2359 , we made use of the wbb model with efficient thermal conduction .",
    "we calculated the x - ray emission from the hot bubble for the case with nominal values for the fast - wind parameters and the mass - loss rate and velocity of @xmath71  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3   ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "it was done in the same way as in @xcite for the wbb ngc  6888 . using the results from the one - dimensional hydrodynamic model",
    ", we calculated the distribution of emission measure of the hot bubble and the corresponding normalization parameter for the model spectrum in xspec ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "then , the actual fit to the x - ray spectrum showed if the theoretical emission measure gave the correct value for the observed flux from ngc  2359 .",
    "the result was that the theoretical x - ray emission matched the shape of the observed spectrum acceptably well but it overestimated the observed flux by more than _ two orders of magnitude _ !    to reconcile this flux discrepancy",
    ", it was necessary to reduce the amount of x - ray emitting plasma in the hot bubble . to do so , we consecutively reduced the mass - loss rates of the fast and slow winds in a series of numerical simulations . the ratio of mass - loss rates and the wind velocities were kept unchanged which resulted in no change of the global geometry of the shock structure . the case with reduced mass - loss rate for the fast and slow winds of @xmath75  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  and @xmath76  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  provided the",
    "correct observed flux . the corresponding fit ( @xmath51/ dof  @xmath77 ) to the _ xmm - newton  _ spectrum of ngc  2359",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : hydrospec ] .",
    "we note that the derived x - ray absorption , n@xmath78 @xmath13 , is consistent with the one from the spectral fit with the discrete - temperature optically - thin plasma model ( see table  [ tab : ngc2359 ] ) . finally , we mention that a better match to the observed spectrum is possible in the ( 0.55 - 0.65 kev ) energy range if the oxygen abundance is allowed to vary .",
    "however , as discussed above , the quality of the data does not allow for getting some decent constraints on the elemental abundances .",
    "moreover , the varied oxygen abundance does not alleviate the problem with the flux discrepancy , that is with the requirement for a highly reduced mass - loss rate of the fast wind .",
    "we thus see that as in the case of ngc  6888 @xcite the standard physical model of a wbb can in general explain the properties of the x - ray emission from ngc  2359 , provided the mass - loss rate of its central star ( wr 7 ) is considerably smaller ( by a factor of @xmath79 ) than the currently accepted value .",
    "future x - ray observations with higher sensitivity and lower detector background will be very important for constraining the x - ray properties of ngc  2359 .",
    "this , in turn , will help us build a more realistic physical picture of this wind - blown bubble .",
    "along these lines , we mention that the low expansion velocity of ngc  2359  poses a problem for the standard physical model of wbbs , and this calls for adopting a global approach to the study of this object .",
    "namely , new and more accurate measurements of the physical characteristics of the optical nebula , the central star itself , and the x - ray properties of ngc  2359  should find their place in a ` unified ' picture which is capable of explaining all of them in a self - consistent way .",
    "in this work , we presented the _ xmm - newton  _ data of ngc  2359  which provide the first detection of this object in x - rays .",
    "we analysed the x - ray properties of this wind - blown bubble and of its central star .",
    "the basic results and conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) as in the case of the other two wbbs detected in x - rays ( s308 and ngc 6888 ) , the x - ray spectrum from ngc  2359  is rather soft and most of the emission is in the 0.3 - 1.5 kev energy range .",
    "no appreciable emission was detected at energies above 2 kev .",
    "the spectrum is well represented by the emission from a relatively cool plasma with a temperature of kt  @xmath0  kev .",
    "\\(ii ) the central star of the nebula , wr 7 , is detected in x - rays .",
    "the spectrum of this wn4 object is well represented by the emission from a two - temperature plasma with a cool component of kt  @xmath1  kev and a hot component of kt  @xmath2  kev .",
    "the x - ray properties of wr 7 are thus similar to those of other presumably single wn stars detected in x - rays .",
    "\\(iii ) the low plasma temperature in ngc  2359  is a sign of efficient electron thermal conduction operating in this object . a direct comparison ( in xspec ) between the one - dimensional hydrodynamic model of conductive wbb and the x - ray spectrum of ngc  2359   suggests a reduced mass - loss rate ( @xmath80  m@xmath18  yr@xmath3  ) of the central star in order to provide the correct value of the observed flux .",
    "we note that this figure is atypically low for the stellar wind in wolf - rayet stars .",
    "we thus think that the best way to build a self - consistent physical picture of ngc  2359  is to carry out a global modelling of the entire system : central star , optical nebula and the hot bubble .",
