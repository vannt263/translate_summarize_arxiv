    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is one of the fundamental models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the asep involves particles that perform asymmetric jumps on a discrete lattice under the exclusion constraint : two particles can not occupy the same site at the same time .",
    "this very simple and minimal system appears as a building block in more realistic descriptions for low - dimensional transport with constraints .",
    "such phenomena occur in various contexts and scales ranging from micrometric cellular motors to traffic networks @xcite .",
    "the remarkable properties of the asep and its numerous variants have stimulated hundreds of studies during the last two decades .",
    "the ramifications of this mundane - looking model through non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , combinatorics , probability , random matrices and representation theory are tremendous @xcite .",
    "generically , a system out of equilibrium carries at least one non - vanishing current in its steady state ( this is related to the breaking of detailed balance ) .",
    "such currents can be considered as archetypal observables for non - equilibrium behaviour @xcite . classifying the different independent stationary currents in a given system , identifying some generic features and relations obeyed by the distributions of these currents and calculating their statistical properties as functions of the control parameters , are some of the important tasks in non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "current fluctuations are usually non - gaussian : their characteristics can be quantified by the moments of the current ( mean - value , variance , skewness , kurtosis ... ) or by a large - deviation function that measures the probability for the current to assume a non - typical value .",
    "there is growing evidence that large - deviation functions play a crucial role in non - equilibrium statistical physics , akin to that of thermodynamic potentials at equilibrium @xcite .",
    "currents transport information from one part of the system to another . in particular , in a system far from equilibrium , boundary conditions can drastically alter the behaviour of the bulk even if interactions are short - ranged ( in contrast with the generic case at equilibrium ) .",
    "for example , as was recognized in the earliest studies @xcite , phase - transitions can be induced by the boundaries or by a localized alteration of the dynamical rules .",
    "it is therefore crucial to specify the boundary conditions ( e.g. periodic , twisted , open boundaries , infinite system ... ) .",
    "the phenomenology of the system and the mathematical techniques that are used to analyse it depend strongly on the chosen boundary conditions .    in the present work we consider the exclusion process on a finite lattice with open boundaries , which can be viewed as a model for a conducting rod in contact with two reservoirs that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other ( for example",
    ", they are at different temperatures , or have different chemical , mechanical or electrical potentials ) . besides , an external field",
    "may be applied to the system .",
    "this external field and the reservoirs drive a current through the system and , in the long time limit , the connecting rod reaches a non - equilibrium stationary state . our aim is to study the statistics of this stationary current .",
    "we give explicit formulae , equations  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) , for the cumulant generating function of the totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) with open boundaries that are valid for arbitrary values of the entrance and exit rates and for all values of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize the fact that our results are of combinatorial nature and not only asymptotic : they describe the tasep in all possible regimes , including the phase - transition lines .",
    "this is in contrast with the asymptotic expression for the large - deviation function of the current obtained very recently using the bethe ansatz @xcite . indeed , as of today , the bethe ansatz for the open tasep @xcite seems to be tractable only in the @xmath1 limit , and only inside the low and high density phases far from the phase - transition lines .",
    "we show that the formula obtained in @xcite for @xmath1 can be retrieved as a limiting case of our general results .",
    "the parametric representation we have found is obtained by using the matrix ansatz technique @xcite .",
    "the calculations are very cumbersome and some combinatorial patterns have been guessed rather than fully calculated .",
    "the formulae we obtain must therefore be considered as conjectures .",
    "but as we shall explain , the results are exact albeit they have been obtained , at present , in a non - rigorous manner .",
    "they have also been thoroughly verified against exact computations for systems of small sizes . besides , all known special cases can be deduced from our general result .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we recall the definition of the model and the basic properties that will be used later ( the master equation , the matrix solution and the phase diagram ) .",
    "section  [ sec : resultats ] contains the main results of this work ; we first restate the problem of current fluctuations in the standard mathematical framework , and then describe the simpler case where all the parameters in the system are equal and taken to be 1 .",
    "the general formulae are presented in [ subsec : general ] and are followed by a physical discussion of the behaviour of the system through the phase diagram ; we also discuss some connections with previously known results . in section  [ sec : calculs ] , we explain the line of reasoning that we have followed to obtain the formula for the current fluctuation , show where the unproven assumptions reside , and describe some numerical verifications .",
    "the last section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "a detailed derivation of the large @xmath0 limit @xcite from the general formula is given in the appendix .",
    "we consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) on a finite lattice of size @xmath0 with open boundaries .",
    "each site of the system can be occupied by at most one particle ( _ exclusion condition _ ) .",
    "the dynamics of the model is defined by the following stochastic rules ( see figure  [ fig - tasep ] ) : a particle at a site @xmath2 in the bulk of the system ( with @xmath3 ) can jump with rate @xmath4 ( i.e with probability @xmath5 during the time interval @xmath5 ) to the site @xmath6 if this target site is vacant ; if site 1 is empty , a particle can enter with rate @xmath7 ; a particle at site @xmath0 can leave the system with rate @xmath8 .",
    "the entrance and exit rates represent the coupling of the finite system with infinite reservoirs located at its boundaries . at a given time",
    ", the system is in one of its @xmath9 possible configurations and evolves according to its stochastic dynamics as a markov process .",
    "the evolution of the system can be encoded in the markov matrix @xmath10 as follows : the probability @xmath11 of being in configuration @xmath12 at time @xmath13 satisfies the master equation @xmath14 the non - diagonal matrix element @xmath15 represents the transition rate from @xmath16 to @xmath12 .",
    "the diagonal part @xmath17 represents ( minus ) the exit rate from @xmath12 .",
    "the markov matrix is a stochastic matrix : the sum of the elements in any given column vanishes .",
    "sites.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in the long time limit , the system reaches a steady state in which each of the @xmath9 possible configurations occurs with a stationary probability .",
    "this steady state probability lies in the kernel of the markov matrix : the rules of the asep ensure that this kernel is non - degenerate and that all other eigenvalues of @xmath10 have strictly negative real - parts that correspond to relaxation states with a possible oscillatory behaviour ( perron - frobenius theorem ) . finding this stationary measure is a non - trivial task :",
    "the model is far from equilibrium with a non - vanishing steady - state current , there is no underlying hamiltonian and no temperature .",
    "therefore the fundamental principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics , such as the boltzmann - gibbs law , can not be used .",
    "the exact calculation of the stationary measure for the tasep with open boundaries and the derivation of its phase diagram have played a seminal role by triggering a whole field of research on exactly solvable models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we recall that the fundamental observation @xcite is the existence of recursion relations for the stationary probabilities between systems of different sizes .",
    "these recursions are particularly striking when @xmath18 @xcite ; they can be generalized to arbitrary values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite and also to the more general case in which backward jumps are allowed ( pasep ) .",
    "the most elegant and efficient way to encode these recursions is to use the matrix ansatz @xcite .",
    "a configuration @xmath12 can be represented by the binary string of length @xmath0 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 if the site @xmath2 is occupied and @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "then , to each @xmath12 , the following matrix element is associated : @xmath22 the scalar @xmath23 , thus defined , will be equal to the stationary probability of @xmath12 if the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the bra - vector @xmath26 and the ket - vector @xmath27 satisfy the following algebraic relations @xmath28 this algebra allows us to calculate any matrix element of type  ( [ mpa ] ) .",
    "the normalisation constant in equation  ( [ mpa ] ) is given by @xmath29 for @xmath18 , @xmath30 is a catalan number @xcite .",
    "more generally , the matrix product representation method has proved to be very fruitful for solving many one - dimensional systems : a very thorough review of this method can be found in @xcite .    from the exact solution , the phase diagram of the tasep , as well as stationary equal - time correlations and density profiles , can be determined . in the limit of large system sizes ,",
    "the phase diagram ( figure  [ fig - diagphase ] ) consists of three main regions    * for @xmath31 the system is in the _ low - density phase _ and its behaviour is driven by the entrance rate @xmath7 .",
    "the bulk - density is @xmath32 and the average current @xmath33 .",
    "* the _ high density phase _ , for @xmath34 is characterized by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . * in the _ maximal current phase , _ with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the bulk behaviour is independent of the boundary conditions and one has @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "however , correlations with the boundaries decay only algebraically whereas they decay exponentially in the two other phases . *",
    "the low and high density phases are separated by the _ ` shock - line ' , _",
    "@xmath41 , across which the bulk - density is discontinuous .",
    "in fact , the profile on this line is a mixed - state of shock - profiles interpolating between the lower density @xmath42 and the higher density @xmath43 .",
    "detailed properties of the phase diagram are reviewed for example in @xcite .",
    "we note that the phase diagram was obtained in @xcite through physical reasoning by using a hydrodynamic limit and mean - field arguments ( see also @xcite )",
    ". however , a finer analysis does require the knowledge of the exact solution .",
    "many properties of the asep have been understood using different techniques ( matrix ansatz , bethe ansatz , random matrices ) .",
    "however , the determination of current fluctuations in the original tasep model with open boundaries has remained a vexing and challenging unsolved problem .",
    "this question is interesting and important : first , in presence of reservoirs , the model is quite realistic and can be related to real experimental situations @xcite ( a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite ) ; second , the exact calculation of fluctuations to all order is akin to determining the large - deviations of the current which are expected to play a central role in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "we consider the tasep with open boundaries and want to study the total ( i.e. , time - integrated ) current that has flown through it in the long time limit .",
    "one way to quantify this total current is to place a counting variable @xmath44 at the entrance site . at @xmath45",
    "we have @xmath46 ; each time a particle enters the system , we increment the value of @xmath44 by 1 . hence , @xmath44 is a random variable that counts the total number of particles that have entered the tasep between time 0 and @xmath13 .",
    "because the size @xmath0 is bounded and no particles are created or destroyed in the bulk , @xmath44 also represents , when @xmath47 , the number of particles that have crossed any bond in the system , or have exited from the tasep from its right boundary .",
    "we call @xmath44 the total current at time @xmath13 and we intend to study its statistical properties .",
    "when @xmath48 , the expectation value of @xmath49 converges towards the average stationary current @xmath50 : @xmath51 the value of @xmath30 , defined in equation  ( [ def : z_l ] ) , was determined exactly in @xcite using the matrix ansatz .",
    "the variance of @xmath44 in the long time limit also increases linearly with time .",
    "this allows to define a ` diffusion - constant ' @xmath52 , as follows : @xmath53 an exact expression for @xmath54 was obtained in @xcite .",
    "it involved an extension of the matrix method to represent some two - time correlations in the stationary state . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the formula for @xmath52 is quite elegant and involves simple factorial factors ( see the next section ) .",
    "unfortunately , the general result is somehow less compact ( see equations ( 58 ) to ( 61 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "more generally , one can define moments and cumulants to all orders for the random variable @xmath44 .",
    "this data can be encoded in the exponential generating function @xmath56 the moments of @xmath44 are obtained by taking successively the derivatives of this function at @xmath57 . in the long - time limit , we have @xmath58 ( a mathematical equality is obtained by taking the logarithm of both sides , dividing by @xmath13 and taking @xmath48 ) .",
    "the derivation of this result is recalled in section  [ sec : calculs ] . because the logarithm of @xmath59 generates the cumulants of @xmath44",
    ", we observe that these cumulants grow linearly with time and that their values are given by the derivatives of @xmath60 at @xmath57 .",
    "the cumulant generating function @xmath60 is related to the large - deviation function of the current by laplace transform . for finite - size systems ,",
    "both functions carry the same information .",
    "the function @xmath60 was calculated for the symmetric exclusion process in @xcite .",
    "very recently , the analysis of the bethe ansatz equations , for @xmath1 was carried out for the asymmetric case , in the low and in the large density phases @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we obtain an explicit representation of the generating function of the cumulants of the current for all values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 and for all values of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "the technique used is an extension of the matrix method ( see section [ sec : calculs ] ) .    for pedagogical reasons we shall first discuss the case @xmath18 , which belongs to the maximal current phase . here , the formulae are explicit , quite simple and appealing .",
    "the general case with arbitrary values of @xmath61 will be presented in a separate subsection .      here ,",
    "we consider the values @xmath55 .",
    "historically , the tasep with @xmath55 was the first case for which the stationary measure was determined exactly @xcite .",
    "for the cumulants of the current , these special values lead to simple mathematical expressions .",
    "the generating function of the cumulants @xmath60 is given as a function of @xmath62 through the following representation in terms of a parameter @xmath63 : @xmath64!}{[k(l+1 ) ] !",

    "for example , we obtain @xmath67 this expression is identical to that found in @xcite .",

    "it is found that the @xmath73-th cumulant scales as @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "we determined the constant prefactor for the first few values of @xmath73 .",
    "the fact that the large deviation function is obtained in parametric form should not come as a surprise . on the contrary",
    ", this structure seems to be rather common : to our knowledge it appeared first in @xcite , where the exact large deviation function for the tasep on a ring was calculated by bethe ansatz ; it also occurred in the case of a defect particle on a ring @xcite .",
    "the complete solution for the current fluctuations of the asep on a ring involves a tree - structure that is again written parametrically @xcite .",
    "more generally , it was shown in @xcite that for a large class of non - equilibrium diffusive systems , characterized by a linear conductivity and equilibrium diffusion coefficient , the large deviation function can be expressed through a parametric set of equations .",
    "we observe that the limiting value of the skewness , given in equation  ( [ skewlimit ] ) , is a finite number .",
    "more generally , one can construct simple ratios of cumulants that have a finite limit when @xmath1 .",
    "it should be possible to ` measure ' such numbers in simulations and to test the universality of these ratios in a manner similar to @xcite .",
    "we now give the result for the cumulant generating function , valid for any system size @xmath0 and for arbitrary values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the mathematical structure is the same as above : @xmath76 the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the series are functions of the rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 and of @xmath0 .",

    "these equations are valid for any system size @xmath0 and for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "before we proceed further , we explain the meaning of the symbol @xmath82 : it represents the complex integral along 3 infinitesimal contours that encircle the points 0 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the complex plane .",

    "we can carry on this procedure further to a few more orders to obtain higher cumulants and we did so with the help of a symbolic mathematical calculation tool .",
    "it is of greater interest to analyse the behaviour of the large - deviation function in the different phases of the model when @xmath1 .",
    "* in the maximal current phase , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 lie inside the unit circle .",
    "hence , the contour integrals that appear in equations  ( [ def : ck ] ) and  ( [ def : dk ] ) can be replaced by a single integral along the unit circle .",
    "then , we apply the saddle - point method to estimate the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath77 and @xmath106 when @xmath1 .",
    "the saddle point is at @xmath107 and we observe that the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 do not influence the saddle - point estimation at dominant order : in fact they contribute by the same multiplicative factor @xmath108^{2k}$ ] , that can be reabsorbed in the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of the cumulants in the large @xmath0 limit does not depend on the boundary rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the maximal current phase ( as expected )",

    "* in the low density phase , @xmath109 , the parameter @xmath83 is outside the unit circle , we have @xmath110 and the position of @xmath84 with respect to the unit circle is not determined . in the large @xmath0 limit , it is the pole at @xmath111 that contributes dominantly to the values of @xmath77 and @xmath106 and the parametric representation  ( [ generalgammab ] ) and  ( [ generaleenb ] ) becomes ( see the appendix for more details ) @xmath112 where the function @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 these expressions can be used to calculate the first few cumulants in the low density phase : @xmath115 with the mean density @xmath32 .",

    "( in @xcite , the general pasep is studied : this adds a prefactor @xmath117 to  ( [ limitld ] ) , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the rates of forward and backward jumps , respectively , and modifies the definition of @xmath83 ) .",
    "we remark that the limit formula  ( [ limitld ] ) is rather simple and that it is _ totally independent _ of the specific form of the function @xmath113 , as can be seen from the derivation given in the appendix .",

    "the shock line @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath120 can also be analyzed from our general formula .",
    "we have calculated explicitly the first few cumulants and obtained the following scaling behaviour @xmath121 we recall that the current is given by @xmath122 .",
    "the numerical coefficients are given by @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ... the fact that the higher cumulants grow without bounds with @xmath0 whereas they are bounded in low and high density phases may come as a surprise .",
    "however , it is known that in the shock phase , particles have a vanishing chemical potential and the equivalence between canonical and grand - canonical descriptions breaks down @xcite .",
    "+ more precisely , this puzzling scaling can be understood from the domain - wall picture , introduced in @xcite to describe the discontinuity by a factor @xmath127 in the diffusion - constant along the shock line . in the limiting case @xmath128 , the dominant configurations are shock profiles between a low density region with @xmath129 and a high density region with @xmath130 .",
    "the shock is localized on a single site .",
    "the dynamics becomes equivalent to that of a symmetric random walker on a lattice of @xmath131 sites and confined by two reflecting boundaries .",
    "the number of particles having entered the tasep corresponds to the number of leftward steps of the shock .",
    "the statistics of the steps performed by an effective random walker between two reflecting walls is a well - posed problem that can be studied independently .",
    "for instance , we find that the skewness ( third cumulant ) of the random walker grows as @xmath132 .",
    "however , if we introduce some bias in the jumping rates ( which corresponds to the high or low density phase ) the walker becomes localized near one of the walls and all cumulants remain finite when @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the @xmath133 s can be calculated by remarking that the random walker between two reflecting walls can be mapped to the tasep with 2 identical particles on a periodic lattice , and then using the results of @xcite .",
    "we now describe briefly how the expressions  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) were obtained .",
    "detailed explanations are deferred to a forthcoming article .      in order to study the statistics of @xmath44 , the total number of particles that have entered into the system , one introduces the joint distribution @xmath134 , the probability of being at time @xmath13 in configuration @xmath12 and having @xmath135 .",
    "the evolution equation of @xmath134 can be written using the markov equation  ( [ eq : markov ] ) .",

    "thus , we obtain equation  ( [ momenteigenval ] ) @xmath146 the cumulant generating function is therefore identical to the largest eigenvalue of the deformed operator @xmath138 and the problem of determining the statistics of @xmath44 has been traded for a spectral problem .",
    "this question can be tackled using different methods .",
    "bethe ansatz is one technique for integrable systems .",
    "another approach , valid for small values of @xmath62 , is to perform a perturbative expansion around the dominant eigenvector , @xmath147 , and the dominant eigenvalue , @xmath148 , of the original markov matrix @xmath10 : @xmath149 carrying out the perturbative expansion explicitly , we find that the @xmath73-th order correction to the eigenvector satisfies an equation of the type @xmath150 @xmath151 being a linear functional .",
    "for example , we have @xmath152 moreover , the solvability condition ( obtained by using the fact that vector @xmath153 is the left null - eigenvector of the markov matrix @xmath10 ) allows to express the @xmath73-th term in @xmath60 ( i.e. , the cumulant of order @xmath73 ) as a linear function of the @xmath154 vectors @xmath155 .",
    "for example , we have @xmath156    the cumulants of the current can be found if we are able to solve the set of linear equations  ( [ eq : ordrek ] ) for all values of @xmath157 . at order 0 ,",
    "the stationary state @xmath158 and the mean current @xmath159 were calculated thanks to the matrix ansatz , recalled in equations  ( [ mpa ] )  ( [ dehpalgebra ] ) and ( [ def : z_l ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the first order correction was also obtained by a matrix ansatz : the required algebra was constructed by taking tensor products of two quadratic algebras of the type  ( [ dehpalgebra ] ) .",
    "this allowed to calculate the diffusion constant @xmath160 .",
    "the computations that we have carried out can be summarized by the following steps :    \\(i ) the matrix ansatz used in @xcite has been simplified and generalized to all orders .",
    "the operators required to calculate the @xmath161-th cumulant are denoted by @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "these operators are constructed by using @xmath164 tensor products of the original @xmath165 and @xmath166 s .",
    "this may appear daunting at first sight but in fact this is not so bad : the @xmath162 and @xmath167 already appear in the studies of multispecies exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "there they were introduced as formal objects to construct the stationary measure . here , they are used as tools for calculations .",
    "we have also found the boundary vectors @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "\\(ii ) the fact that @xmath162 and @xmath167 allow to solve the system  ( [ eq : ordrek ] ) at each order has been _ proved recursively_. using the relations  ( [ relationsek ] ) , an expression for the cumulant @xmath170 in terms of matrix elements involving @xmath162 and @xmath167 and the previously determined @xmath171 s for @xmath172 can be written .",
    "\\(iii ) the next step is to calculate the matrix elements .",
    "typically , one has to determine a ` normalization'-type term @xmath173 that generalizes  ( [ def : z_l ] )",
    ". such a matrix element can be found by using the image method @xcite in a space of dimension @xmath164 .",
    "the resulting expression involves sums of products of binomial factors .",
    "these binomial factors can be expressed as multiple contour integrals and the total sum can be recast as a determinant . as this stage ,",
    "the cumulants are written as complex integrals over determinantal expressions .",
    "\\(iv ) the diffusion constant ( @xmath174 ) was recalculated .",
    "the skewness ( @xmath175 ) was then determined by evaluating the contour integrals .",
    "these integrals produce a ` generic ' term and a very large number of boundary terms .",
    "it was found that the global contribution of the boundary terms cancels out for @xmath176 and 3 .",
    "it was also observed that a parametric expression for @xmath62 and @xmath65 at order 3 as a function of an arbitrary parameter @xmath63 allows to retrieve the diffusion constant and the skewness .",
    "\\(v ) at @xmath73-th order , a calculation of the ` generic ' term was performed _ by assuming that the various contributions of boundary terms globally cancel out_. it was observed that the resulting formula could also be obtained through the parametric expressions  ( [ generalgammab ] ) and  ( [ generaleenb ] ) for @xmath62 and @xmath65 at order @xmath73 with respect to @xmath63 , that were _ guessed _ at all orders .",
    "we admit that our final result was guessed rather than fully worked out .",
    "the gaps in our derivations ( steps ( iv ) and ( v ) ) have to be filled .",
    "however , we emphasize that we have been using a systematic procedure and that we are absolutely sure that the equations  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) are correct .",
    "we have tested numerically the conjectured formulae in the following cases :    * for @xmath18 , the formula  ( [ skew11 ] ) for the skewness was compared with the exact result obtained by solving the linear equations  ( [ eq : ordrek ] ) for the first three orders for systems of sizes @xmath177 .",
    "the results agreed in all cases .",
    "the expressions are rational numbers which involve integers having more than 20 digits . * for @xmath18 ,",
    "the first 6 cumulants were verified for @xmath177 . * the formula for the second cumulant  ( [ deltaabgene ] ) as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath178 was tested against the exact result for @xmath179 .",
    "* we have chosen arbitrary values of @xmath7 and @xmath178 throughout the phase diagram ( a dozen of different cases ) . by taking rational values for @xmath7 and @xmath178",
    ", we insure that the formal mathematical program ( mathematica ) performs exact calculations on integers when solving the linear equations  ( [ eq : ordrek ] ) .",
    "we have worked with systems of size @xmath180 and tested the formula up to the 6th cumulant .",
    "the integers that appear involve hundreds of digits ( 450 in the worst chosen case ) : the expressions  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) give the correct answer in all cases .    finally , we emphasize the formulae given here allow us to re - derive results that were known previously , such as equations  ( [ diffconst ] ) and  ( [ limitld ] ) .",
    "this provides an indirect verification of their correctness .",
    "in the present work , we give closed formulae for the generating function of the cumulants of the current in the open tasep .",
    "these results hold for all values of the boundary parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 and all values of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize the fact that our expressions are exact and not only asymptotic : they are of combinatorial nature .",
    "they allow us to describe the asep at all points of its phase diagram , including the phase - transition lines .",
    "the cumulant generating function is given in the form of a parametric representation ",
    "equations  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) : a similar mathematical structure can be found in other works @xcite and it can be related physically to the additivity principle @xcite .",
    "the statistics of the current in the open tasep had remained a challenging open problem for many years and no exact solution for the full distribution of the current was known for finite size systems .",
    "the bethe ansatz equations for the open asep were studied in @xcite but they are valid only on some surfaces in the parameter space : this restriction seemed to be a major obstruction to the computation of the large - deviation function . only recently , a very subtle analysis of the bethe equations , valid in the @xmath1 limit , together with some conjectures on the asymptotic locations of the bethe roots , was carried out in @xcite , leading to an expression for the cumulant generating function .",
    "however , the result in @xcite can only be established deep inside the low and the high density phases and it is an asymptotic expression , valid only when @xmath1 . in our work , we have followed a different path and used the matrix product representation @xcite to calculate the cumulants of the current order by order .",
    "we have performed some explicit calculations and uncovered the general structure of the solution . from the mathematical point of view ,",
    "our formulae are only a conjecture but we have verified it in dozens of cases and derived from it all the previously known results .",
    "we have absolutely no doubt that our expressions are true .",
    "in particular , the main expression obtained in @xcite can be derived as a limiting case of our results .",
    "we have decided to present the final formulae before completing the proof , because we find the results elegant and sufficient by themselves .",
    "furthermore , they allow to draw some interesting physical consequences and to open new problems .",
    "we think that the proof is a question of carrying out a very long computation rather than having some deep mathematical insight .",
    "we are presently working on this aspect .",
    "we hope to have given enough details to the reader to clarify what kind of assumptions were made , that allowed us to jump to the final result and to guess the full structure of the solution .",
    "another possibility , now that the final formula is known , is to search for a direct method to check it : after all , the cumulant generating function is nothing but the largest eigenvalue of a known operator .",
    "besides completing the derivation , we also intend to extract from equations  ( [ generalgammab ] ) to  ( [ def : fonctionf ] ) the scaling limit of the large deviation function in the @xmath1 limit",
    ". it would be interesting to compare that scaling form with recent numerical results obtained by monte - carlo and dmrg methods @xcite and also to investigate the crossover with theoretical results derived on the infinite lattice @xcite .",
    "finally , we have considered here only the tasep .",
    "but the matrix method can also be applied to the partially asymmetric case ( pasep ) , and we have checked that tensor products of the pasep quadratic algebra that appeared in multispecies pasep models @xcite allow us to solve the hierarchy of equations  ( [ eq : ordrek ] ) for the cumulants .",
    "we believe that the parametric representation still holds in the pasep case and that combinatorial tree - structures akin to those found for the pasep on a periodic ring in @xcite will probably play an important role . besides , complex integral representations for matrix elements analogous to those we have used here also appear in the pasep @xcite",
    ". there must exist a general and hopefully elegant structure that encompasses all the cases , though we are well aware that such a structure may be difficult to discover .",
    "we acknowledge interesting discussions with o. golinelli , s. prolhac and r. vasseur .",
    "we are grateful to s. mallick for a very careful reading of the manuscript and p. krapivsky for useful remarks .",
    "we are thankful to b. derrida for telling us how to obtain equation  ( [ limitld ] ) from macroscopic fluctuation theory .",
    "let @xmath181,@xmath182 and @xmath183 be three infinitesimal contours ( circles ) that surround the points @xmath148 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the complex plane . according to equations  ( [ def : ck ] ) and  ( [ def : dk ] )",
    ", we must calculate contour integrals along these three circles .",
    "we denote by @xmath184 the unit circle .    in the low density phase @xmath109 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is outside the unit disk and we have @xmath110 .",
    "the point @xmath84 can be either inside or outside the unit disk . in order to perform a saddle - point analysis in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", a contour must pass through the point @xmath107 .",
    "we therefore deform the infinitesimal contour @xmath181 encircling 0 into the unit circle @xmath184 .",
    "but then we must remove the contribution of the pole @xmath185 of @xmath80 which is inside @xmath184 ( see figure  [ fig - contours ] ) .",
    "we must also distinguish the cases @xmath186 or @xmath187 : for @xmath188 we can write , formally : @xmath189 .",
    "for @xmath190 we can write @xmath191 . now",
    "the function @xmath192 satisfies : @xmath193 .",
    "thus for @xmath194 , we have @xmath195    & = &   -   \\hbox{residue}\\left[\\frac{f(z)^k}{z } , 1/z_0   \\right ]     \\nonumber \\\\      \\hbox{residue}\\left[\\frac{f(z)^k}{(z+1)^2 } , z_0   \\right ] & = &   -   \\hbox{residue}\\left[\\frac{f(z)^k}{(z+1)^2 } , 1/z_0   \\right ]   \\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] formally this can be written as @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "finally the contours for the complex integrals reduce to @xmath198 if @xmath188 and to @xmath199 if @xmath200 .",
    "the integral over @xmath184 is estimated by saddle point : it is of order @xmath201 .",
    "the integral over @xmath202 is of order @xmath203 ( because @xmath204 ) .",
    "the residue at @xmath84 contributes only when @xmath205 but in that case it is of order @xmath206 ( because @xmath207 ) .",
    "hence , in all cases , in the large @xmath0 limit , the dominant contribution comes from the contour around @xmath83 , which has to be counted twice . finally , using cauchy s formula , we can write @xmath208 where the function @xmath113 has been defined in  ( [ def : fonctionphi ] ) . similarly , we have @xmath209 substituting these expressions into the formulae  ( [ generalgammab ] ) and  ( [ generaleenb ] ) leads to equations  ( [ gversusbld ] ) and  ( [ eversusbld ] ) .",
    "we now need the lagrange inversion formula @xcite , that can be stated as follows .",
    "suppose that the two complex variables @xmath210 and @xmath211 are related in terms of the parameter @xmath63 as @xmath212 where @xmath213 is locally analytic . then , any function @xmath214 can be expanded as a power - series in @xmath63 as follows : @xmath215        eliminating @xmath211 between the last two equations leads to the desired expression  ( [ limitld ] ) .",
    "we note that the precise form of @xmath113 has played no role .",
    "this suggest that the formula  ( [ limitld ] ) for the cumulant generating function should be rather universal .",
