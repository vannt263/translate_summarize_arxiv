    "<S> next we discuss the origin of the unipolar electric order of the interfacial srtio@xmath0 layer and its relationship to the metal - to - insulator transition of the confined electrons . </S>",
    "<S> srtio@xmath0 is an incipient ferroelectric material for which the correlation length starts to diverge below @xmath32  k , but for which long range order is inhibited by the quantum lattice fluctuations @xcite . despite the large thickness of the pyroelectric layer of @xmath33 m at @xmath19  v , </S>",
    "<S> the polar order thus may be governed by the properties of the lao / sto interface . </S>",
    "<S> a built - in electric field that is pointing toward the sto substrate likely plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> it arises from the interfacial electronic and structural reconstruction and yields the band - bending and the confining potential of the interfacial electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this local field can explain the unipolar nature of the electric order and also that its onset occurs already at a positive gate voltage ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(f ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> a corresponding lattice polarization in the first few sto monolayers has been predicted @xcite and observed in a recent surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) study @xcite . the lattice distortion and the underlying local electric field increase as the lao thickness grows from @xmath34 to 5 . </S>",
    "<S> we found indeed that the unipolar field effect on the @xmath12-mode is significantly smaller in a lao / sto heterostructure with @xmath4 and is entirely absent in a control device with a thin ti electrode that was directly deposited on a srtio@xmath0 substrate . </S>",
    "<S> our observations thus argue for an important role of the electronic and structural reconstruction at the lao / sto interface .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that the confined electrons are playing an active role in the pyroelectric phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the polarity of the electric order yields a negative ionic charge density at the lao / sto interface for which the interfacial electrons can not stabilize the order by screening the external electric stray field . on the other hand , the field - induced metal - to - insulator transition of the confined electrons may well be triggered or even driven by the development of the pyroelectric order . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reduces the polarizability of the lattice and thus its ability to screen defects that scatter and eventually localize the confined electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization also increases the confining potential and thus may enhance the localization effects underlying the metal - to - insulator transition .    </S>",
    "<S> a close connection between the development of the electric order and the rapid increase of the resistance of the lao / sto heterostructure is indeed observed as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) show that the voltage dependence of the resistance changes around 50  k. at higher temperature the resistance exhibits a weak , linear increase toward negative bias voltages . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at lower temperature the resistance increases much more rapidly and starts to exhibit a hysteretic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](c ) compares the voltage loops of the resistance at 10  k with the splitting of the @xmath12-mode which is a measure of the electric polarization . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms that the field - induced metal - to - insulator transition occurs in close vicinity to the pyroelectric transition . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the resistance exhibits a similar hysteresis loop as the polarization of srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , figure  [ fig4](d ) shows that the charge localization and the polar order develop below 50  k. this comparison suggests that the electric - field - induced transition of the confined electrons from a metallic or superconducting to a localized state is strongly influenced or likely even directly induced by the pyroelectric order .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained evidence that the electric - field - induced localization of the confined electrons in lao / sto heterostructures is induced , or at least strongly enhanced , by a pyroelectric phase transition which takes place in a thick ( @xmath33 m ) srtio@xmath0 layer adjacent to the interface . in particular , we showed that the charge localization and the polar order occur in the same voltage and temperature ranges and exhibit similar , unipolar hysteresis loops . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that this pyroelectric order and the subsequent reduction of the coulomb screening also need to be considered for the interpretation of the quantum phase transition where superconductivity is suppressed by an electric field below @xmath35  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that these lao / sto heterostructures are a unique platform where multiple long range orders , like superconductivity , ferromagnetism and now pyroelectricity , can be combined and readily modified with external parameters like electric or magnetic fields and possibly also with external pressure .    </S>",
