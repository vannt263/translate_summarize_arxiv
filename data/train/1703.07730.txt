    "the study of the flux - flow region in type ii superconductors gained additional attention after the discovery of the high-@xmath3 superconductors @xcite which display a large reversible region associated to a non - zero resistivity .",
    "this non - zero resistivity flux - flow region has been mainly explained in terms of the thermal assisted flux - flow model @xcite , taff , within a vortex - liquid phase that forms as the vortex lattice is thermally depinned as temperature increases above the irreversibility line .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that depending on the disorder , a vortex - glass phase , vg , can emerge below the glass temperature , @xmath6 , at which the resistivity is zero @xcite .",
    "a finger - print of this phase is that the flux - flow resistivity should exhibit a critical behaviour as temperature approaches @xmath6 . as a consequence of these two models ,",
    "the flux - flow region usually studied from isofield magneto - resistivity curves , allows to obtain from the theories the activation energy , @xmath5(@xmath9 ) , associated with the dissipative mechanism which is an important parameter from the potential applications point of view . as iron pnictides systems",
    "@xcite also display a considerable large reversible region , the flux - flow region have been studied in many compounds , including ca@xmath10la@xmath11feas@xmath2 @xcite , cefeasof @xcite , smfeaso@xmath12f@xmath13 @xcite , bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 @xcite , bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 @xcite , ( ba , k)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite , the chalcogenades fete@xmath14se@xmath15 @xcite and fe@xmath16te@xmath17se@xmath18 @xcite , and ag - doped fese@xmath19",
    "@xcite among others . on the other hand , studies of the vortex - glass phase in pnictides",
    "are still reduced being restricted to few compounds.@xcite it should be noted that most of the flux - pinning studies in pnictides are conducted in only one sample of each system . since pnictide superconductors has been considered as a potential materials for applications , a question that rises is whether flux - pinning properties as well as the irreversibility line show changes among different samples of the same system .    in the present work ,",
    "we address the above mentioned important issue by studying the flux - flow region on three crystals of the electron - doped pnictide system of bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 @xcite , which is one of the most studied pnictide systems @xcite and may be considered a potential material for application in future .",
    "the study was conducted by analysing isofield magnetoresistivity data obtained for three different geometries of the applied magnetic field with respect to the c - axis of the samples , on three different high - quality crystals with superconducting transitions temperature , @xmath3 , equal to 19.8 k ( crystal@xmath201 ) , 19.7 k ( crystal @xmath202 ) and 19.8 k ( crystal @xmath203 ) , and @xmath21 equal to 0.096 ( @xmath201 ) , 0.096(@xmath202 ) and 0.098 ( @xmath203 ) respectively , where the values of @xmath21 are close to the optimally doped @xmath21=0.1 . in parallel with this comparative study of flux - flow region in three different samples of same pnictide system , we have also made some efforts to see the possibility of vortex - glass phase .",
    "another motivation was try to compare values of @xmath5 obtained in the flux - flow region with those obtained in the irreversible region from flux - creep measurements .",
    "such comparison can be useful as many samples are characterised from flux - creep measurements .",
    "the flux - flow region of each isofield curve was analysed in terms of the taff @xcite and the modified vortex - glass models @xcite , allowing to obtain the correspondent values of the field dependent activation energies .",
    "further , these values of the activation energy were compared with the @xmath5 extracted from the flux - creep data presented in the literature for bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 superconductor with @xmath3@xmath420 k @xcite .",
    "we observed that @xmath5(@xmath9 ) obtained from flux - creep are about an order of magnitude smaller than those obtained from the taff model , but are of same order of magnitude of those obtained from the modified vortex - glass model .",
    "it has also been observed that values of @xmath5(@xmath9 ) obtained from the taff model for the present three crystals show small deviations among them , while plots of the glass lines obtained for these three crystals are virtually identical .",
    "we observed that our data obey the modified vortex - glass model allowing to estimate values of @xmath3(@xmath9 ) , which is a new result .",
    "it is shown that the resulting glass lines obey the ginzburg - landau anisotropic theory and are well fitted by a theory developed in ref.@xcite for the glass line considering the effect of disorder .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity , @xmath22(@xmath23 ) were obtained by the standard four probe ac lock - in technique with the current flowing along the ab - planes ( along the b - axis ) of the crystals always perpendicular to the applied magnetic field , and voltage was measured with wires placed along the a - axis .",
    "isofield magneto - resistivity curves were obtained as a function of temperature for applied magnetic fields , @xmath9 , running from 0 to 14 t , for three different orientations of @xmath9 with respect to the c - axis of the samples : @xmath9@xmath24c - axis , @xmath9@xmath25c - axis ( @xmath9@xmath24ab - planes ) and @xmath9 forming an angle of 53 degrees with the c - axis .",
    "information regarding samples grown can be found in ref.@xcite and details about samples dimensions and resistivity measurements can be found in ref.@xcite where the same data here studied were analysed in terms of superconducting fluctuations in the conductivity .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the analysis presented in ref.@xcite was focused on data lying above the superconducting transition temperature with field , @xmath8 , corresponding to data lying above the flux - flow region .",

    "<S> we analysed the flux - flow region of isofield magneto resistivity data obtained on three crystals of bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 with @xmath3@xmath420 k for three different geometries relative to the angle formed between the applied magnetic field and the c - axis of the crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependent activation energy , @xmath5 , was obtained from the taff and modified vortex - glass models , which were compared with the values of @xmath5 obtained from flux - creep available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the @xmath5 obtained from the taff model show deviations among the different crystals , while the correspondent glass lines obtained from the vortex glass model are virtually coincident . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the data is well explained by the modified vortex glass model , allowing to extract values of @xmath6 , the glass transition temperature , and @xmath7 , a temperature which scales with the mean field critical temperature @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting glass lines obey the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory and are well fitted by a theory developed in the literature by considering the effect of disorder . </S>"
