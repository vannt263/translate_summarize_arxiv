    "there are 170 unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in the third egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , where @xmath1150 sources close to the galactic plane with @xmath12 and @xmath1170 sources in the medium latitudes with @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for those unidentified @xmath0-ray sources in the galactic plane , many of them are associated with wolf - rayet and of stars , snrs and ob stars(montmerle 1979 ; kaaret & cottam 1996 ; yadigaroglu & romani 1997 , romero et al .",
    "most of these objects are considered as pulsar tracers , therefore it is natural to suggest that these low latitude sources may be geminga - like pulsars , which are radio - quiet pulsars ( yadigaroglu & romani 1995 ; cheng & zhang 1998 ; zhang , zhang & cheng 2000 ) . since @xmath0-ray pulsars are known to be steady @xmath0-ray emitters , it has been suggested that the variability should be a good indicator to identify the real pulsar candidates from the unidentified egret sources ( romero , combi & colomb 1994 ; mclaughlin et al .",

    "; nolan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "gehrels et al .",
    "( 2000 ) define a class of sources as steady : a source is steady if the most significant detection of a source in 3eg catalogue is for a timescale of years and if that particular flux is within @xmath16 of the flux calculated for the full data set . from this classification ,",
    "48 unidentified sources at @xmath17 and 72 unidentified sources at @xmath18 are steady sources respectively . on the other hand , grenier ( 2001 )",
    "suggests another definition called persistent sources , which are those detected sources with a significance @xmath19 for every observation at @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume that the sources with a significance @xmath21 at @xmath22 are persistent sources , there are 40 ( 45 ) persistent unidentified egret sources at @xmath23 ( @xmath18 ) .    however , the spectral properties of medium latitude sources are significantly softer , fainter and have a steeper logn - logs function than those at low latitudes ( gehrels et al .",
    "it has been suggested that they are associated with recent supernovae in the nearby gould belt ( grenier 1997 ; gehrels et al . 2000 ; grenier 2000 ) .",
    "their natures remain as mystery .",
    "harding and zhang ( 2001 ) used the polar cap models ( daugherty & harding 1996 ; harding & muslimov 1998 ) to investigate whether @xmath0-ray pulsars viewed at a large angle to the neutron star magnetic pole could contribute to unidentified egret sources in the medium latitudes associated with the gould belt .",
    "they suggest that the off - beam @xmath0-rays come from high - altitude curvature emission of primary particles can radiate over a large solid angle and have a much softer spectrum than that of the main beams , and at least some of radio - quiet gould belt sources detected by egret could be such off - beam @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "recently , the brightest of unidentified egret sources in the medium latitude , 3eg j1835 + 5918 , is strongly suggested as the second geminga - like pulsar ( radio - quiet pulsar ) by multi - wavelength observations including chandra , hst and jodrell bank ( mirabal et al .",
    "2000 ; mirabal & halpern 2001 ; halpern et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be described by two components : a soft thermal x - ray spectrum with a characteristic temperature ( @xmath24k and a power law hard tail with a photon index @xmath252 , which closely resembles to the x - ray spectrum of geminga .",
    "the repeated radio observations at jodrell bank did not show any periodicity .",
    "the x - ray data suggests that the distance is between 250 - 800pc , which is consistent with the distance to the gould belt .    in this paper",
    ", we use the revised outer gap models ( zhang et al . 2004 ) to investigate emission properties of @xmath0-ray pulsars in the galaxy as well as in the gould belt .",
    "this revised outer gap model is based on the original outer gap models ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , * hereafter chr i * , 1986b ; zhang & cheng 1997 ) but takes into account the effect of the inclination angle ( @xmath26 ) , which is the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis , in determining the size of the outer gap , which is defined as the ratio between the dimension of the gap perpendicular to the magnetic field and the light cylinder radius .",
    "the revised model also takes into account the fact that the typical radiation region of the outer gap is not necessary at half of the light cylinder instead it should be better represented by an appropriate average over the entire outer gap .",
    "this effect is particular important for old pulsars .",
    "if the outer gap is only represented at half of the light cylinder , then the outer gap is assumed to be turn off when the gap size at this region is larger than unity .",
    "this new model has taken the entire active region of the outer gap into account . as long as the gap size is less than unity in some parts of magnetosphere ,",
    "the outer gap still exist .",
    "this effect allows some pulsars with appropriate combination of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , can maintain their outer gaps until a few million years old .",
    "these pulsars are able to move up to high galactic latitude and their ages make them weak @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "furthermore , we will show that these pulsars will emit softer spectra and their relation between @xmath0-ray luminosity and spin - down power differs from that of younger pulsars located in the galactic plane .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section 2 , we review the new outer gap models .",
    "in section 3 , we study the @xmath0-ray emission properties of pulsars by using the new self - consistent outer gap model . in section 4",
    ", we describe a monte carlo simulation method to determine the statistical distributions of radio - quiet and radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize the simulation results and discuss their implications .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section 6 .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) have proposed a self - consistent mechanism to describe the high - energy radiation from the rotation - powered pulsars . in this model ,",
    "the radiation mechanism of relativistic charged particles from a thick outermagnetospheric accelerator ( outer gap ) is synchro - curvature radiation ( cheng & zhang 1996 ) and the characteristic energy of high - energy photon emitted from the outer gap is determined by the pulsar global parameters , i.e. rotation period p and the dipolar magnetic field b , as well as the fractional size of the outer gap ( @xmath29 ) , which is a ratio between the mean vertical separation of the outer gap boundaries in the plane of the rotation axis and the magnetic axis to the light cylinder radius , and is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dipolar magnetic field in unites of @xmath32 g , @xmath33 is the light cylinder radius and @xmath34 is the distance to the neutron star .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum becomes exponentially decay beyond @xmath35 .",
    "the fractional size of the outer gap determines the total @xmath0-ray luminosity from the outer gap ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) and is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spin - down power of pulsar .",
    "chri has shown that the inner boundary of the static outer gap begins at the null charge surface(@xmath38 ) .",
    "recently hirotani & shibata ( 2001 ) has shown that if there is injected current from the inner boundary , the position of the inner boundary can shift either toward the star or even close to the light cylinder depending on the sign and the magnitude of the injected current . however , it is not clear what causes this injected current . in this paper",
    "we shall assume that the outer gap begins at the null charge surface .",
    "the radial distance from the null surface surface to the star is @xmath39 , which is a function of the magnetic inclination angle @xmath26 and is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the polar angle between of @xmath39 determined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the polar angle to the position where the first open field line intercepts the light cylinder determined by @xmath44 .",
    "the fractional size of the outer gap is limited by the pair production between the soft thermal x - rays with characteristic energy @xmath45 from the stellar surface and the high - energy photons with energy @xmath46 emitted from the outer gap .",
    "the energy of the soft x - ray photons is determined by the backflow of the primary electrons / positrons .",
    "each of these backflow particles can still maintain about 10.6p@xmath47 ergs and deposit on the stellar surface .",
    "this energy will be emitted as soft thermal x - rays from the stellar surface ( halpern & ruderman 1993 ) , whose characteristic energy is given by @xmath48ev .",
    "although the thermal x - ray photon density is low , every pair resulting from x - ray and high - energy photon interactions can emit @xmath49 high - energy photons when they are accelerated in the gap .",
    "such a large multiplicity can produce sufficient number of @xmath50 pairs as to sustain the outer gap . assuming @xmath51 and head - on collision",
    ", they obtained the fractional size of the outer gap as @xmath52 from the condition of photon - photon pair production @xmath53 .",
    "however , this model did not take into account the fact that when the magnetic inclination angle ( @xmath26 ) becomes large , the characteristic energy of high - energy photons from the gap , which depends on @xmath26 , also increases .",
    "in fact both @xmath45 and @xmath54 also depend on @xmath26 .",
    "most important , zhang and cheng ( 1997 ) has assumed a typical distance ( @xmath55 ) to represent the outer gap . in other words ,",
    "most radiation and pair production activities are assumed to take place at this characteristic region .",
    "they assume that when @xmath56 the outer gap does not exist . however , even the mid - distance to the outer gap depends on the inclination angle because the outer gap begins at the null charge surface , which depends on @xmath26 .",
    "realistically , as long as @xmath50 pairs can be produced beyond the null surface , the outer gap should be still active , namely , accelerating charged particles .",
    "of course , for regions with @xmath57 the gap potential should drop off rapidly and hence becomes unimportant .",
    "therefore the active region of the outer gap should begin at null surface and stop at a distance @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( zhang et al . 2004 ) . in explaining the detail @xmath0-ray spectrum of a given pulsar ,",
    "it is important to know the radiation coming from which parts of the pulsar magnetosphere ( cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "however , in order to study the statistical properties of pulsars a representative region is a very useful approximation .",
    "they assume that the representative region of the outer gap is the averaging distance to the gap , they obtain the mean fractional size of the gap @xmath60 , which can be approximately expressed as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a monotonically function of @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "it roughly decreases by a factor 3 from young pulsars with large inclination angle to old pulsars with small inclination angle .",
    "the integral expression of @xmath63 is given by eq .",
    "( 38 ) and the variation of @xmath64 for different pulsars is given in figure 3 of zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) respectively .",
    "although the variation of @xmath64 is only a factor of 3 , the implications are very important .",
    "first the cut - off period of @xmath0-ray pulsars is about a factor of @xmath65 longer for fixed @xmath26 and @xmath28 in comparing with the old model .",
    "secondly the cut - off age of @xmath0-ray pulsars is about a factor of 5.8 longer as well .",
    "this means that there are a lot more @xmath0-ray pulsars in high galactic latitude than previously expected .",
    "these @xmath0-ray pulsars with older age can move up to the high galactic latitude and may contribute to the unidentified egret sources .",
    "for the thick outer gap ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) , @xmath0-rays are produced inside the thick outer gap by curvature radiation from the primary @xmath50 pairs along the curved magnetic field lines .",
    "however , cheng & zhang ( 1996 ) studied the radiation from the charged particles in the curved magnetic field , and pointed out that the radiation should be described more accurately by a general radiation mechanism called synchro - curvature radiation mechanism , in which the radiation is being emitted by the charged particles moving in a spiral trajectory along the curved magnetic field lines .",
    "this mechanism differs from synchrotron and curvature mechanisms in general , but reduces to either synchrotron radiation when the radius of curvature of the local magnetic field lines is infinite or to curvature radiation when the pitch angle is zero .",
    "in fact , when the synchrotron gyro - radius @xmath66 and the curvature radius of field @xmath67 is comparable , the synchro - curvature mechanism really provides a significant improvement , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the accelerated particles and @xmath68 is the pitch angle of the charged particles in the curved magnetic field .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) used this mechanism to describe the production of non - thermal photons from the primary @xmath50 pairs along the curved magnetic field lines in the outer gap .",
    "the primary @xmath50 pairs have an approximate power - law distribution inside the outer gap because the energy and density of the primary @xmath50 pairs depend on local values of magnetic field , electric field and radius of curvature . in steady state ,",
    "the energy distribution of the accelerated particles in the outer gap is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the energy of the accelerated particle . using the general formula of the synchro - curvature radiation power spectrum given by cheng & zhang ( 1996 ) and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , the differential flux at the earth is ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) @xmath73dx \\;\\ ; , \\label{flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the solid angle of @xmath0-ray beaming , @xmath75 is the distance to the pulsar , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath82 ; @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the modified bessel functions of order 5/3 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the characteristic energy of the synchro - curvature photons . @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the minimum and maximum values of @xmath89 . for @xmath87 , it can estimated as @xmath90",
    ". the maximum value of @xmath89 can be estimated by @xmath91 ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) , where @xmath68 is the angular width of the polar cap , @xmath92 is the angular width between the magnetic axis to the upper boundary field lines of the outer gap and @xmath93 is the radial distance to the upper boundary field lines intercepting with the light cylinder .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) has discussed the possible value of @xmath88 .",
    "in general the @xmath0-ray beaming solid angle should be different for various @xmath0-ray pulsars , which is a function of the magnetic inclination angle as well as the size of the outer gap(zhang et al .",
    "some approximate forms of beaming solid angle have been given(yadigaroglu & romani 1995 ; zhang , zhang & cheng 2000 ) .",
    "how accurate of these approximation forms are not known . for simplicity , in this paper",
    ", we will treat these two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath88 as constants . by fitting the @xmath0-ray spectrum of known @xmath0-ray pulsars ,",
    "these two parameters are chosen to be @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively ( cheng & zhang 1998 ) .    in order to compare with the egret data ,",
    "the integral flux is necessary and is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the maximum energy of gamma - rays and is chosen to be 100gev .    in fig .",
    "3 , the model @xmath0-ray spectra are calculated for various periods , magnetic fields and inclination angles respectively .",
    "we can see that the spectra become softer when the period decreases , the magnetic field increases or the inclination angle decreases in the energy range of egret ( 100mev-10gev ) . alternatively speaking",
    "the spectral break becomes larger when the period increases , the magnetic field decreases or the inclination angle increases .",
    "we can understand these trends by examining the behavior of the energy break at eq .",
    "typically most power radiated from the primary electrons / positrons come from regions with characteristic distance of order of @xmath98 . substituting eq . 3 and eq . 4 into eq . 1",
    ", we obtain the spectral break is @xmath99 , which explains the relations between spectral variations in fig",
    "however , in subsequent sections we will find that the key differences between @xmath0-ray pulsars in the galactic plane and those in the high galactic latitude are : ( 1)galactic plane @xmath0-ray pulsars are younger , shorter in period and have larger inclination angles and ( 2)they satisfy different relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , most high latitude @xmath0-ray pulsars satisfy @xmath102 which means @xmath103 ( cf .",
    "fig . 6f and the lower panel of fig .",
    "7 ) . in this case",
    ", the spectral break is @xmath104 . since galactic @xmath0-ray pulsars have larger inclination angles and shorter periods in comparing with the high galactic latitude @xmath0-ray pulsars",
    ", so the spectrum of @xmath0-ray pulsars in high galactic latitude has a softer spectrum than those in the galactic plane . in fig .",
    "4 , we compare the typical spectra between the high and low galactic latitude @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "in order to consider the @xmath0-ray luminosity and spatial evolution of pulsars in the galaxy and in gould belt , the initial values of parameters of pulsar at birth , which include the initial position , velocity , period and magnetic field strength , are needed .",
    "the procedure of monte carlo method and the evolution of pulsar parameters are described in our previous works ( cheng & zhang 1998 ; zhang & cheng 1999 ; zhang , zhang & cheng 2000 ; fan , cheng & manchester 2001 ; zhang et al . 2004 ) . here",
    ", we briefly describe basic assumptions for generating the @xmath0-ray pulsars ( radio - quiet and radio - loud ) in the galaxy as well as in the gould belt :    1 the pulsars are born at a rate ( @xmath105 per century ) in the galaxy . the age of the gould belt is estimated to be @xmath1130 myr old and the pulsars are born at a rate of @xmath106 myr@xmath107 ( grenier 2000 ) .",
    "2 the gould belt has an ellipsoidal shaped ring with semi - major and minor axes equal to 500pc and 340pc respectively . the sun is displaced from the center of gould belt about 200pc towards @xmath108(guillout et al .",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand , there are other possible interpretations of the geometry of the gould belt . for examples , olano ( 1982 ) and moreno et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have given smaller size for the gould belt .",
    "however , we will show that most @xmath0-ray pulsars originated from the gould belt are mature pulsars with age nearly 1 million years .",
    "they already move very far away from the gould belt .",
    "the most important point is our solar system is enclosed in the gould belt , the exact dimensions of the gould belt is not very crucial in our problem .",
    "3 the initial position for each pulsar in the galaxy is estimated from the distributions @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the distance from the galactic plane , @xmath113 is the distance from the galactic center , @xmath114 pc , @xmath115^{-1}$ ] , @xmath116 kpc and @xmath117 kpc ( paczynski 1990 ; sturner & dermer 1996 ) .",
    "but the initial position of each pulsar is assumed to be born uniformly inside the gould belt .",
    "4 the initial magnetic fields are distributed as a gaussian in @xmath118 with a mean value of 12.5 and a dispersion of 0.3 . since the majority @xmath0-ray pulsars are younger than 3 million years old and the field does not decay in 10 myr ( bhattacharya et al . 1992 ) .",
    "so we ignore any field decay for these rotation - powered pulsars .    5 the initial period is chosen to be @xmath119=10ms and the period at time @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 .",
    "we would like to remark that the initial period is not very crucial for our problem because the typical age of @xmath0-ray pulsars is of order of million years old .",
    "6 the initial velocity of each pulsar is the vector sum of the circular rotation velocity at the birth location and random velocity from the supernova explosion(paczynski 1990 ) . the circular velocity is determined by galactic gravitational potential and the random velocity is distributed as a maxwellian distribution with a dispersion of three dimensional velocity = @xmath122km / s ( lorimer et al .",
    "furthermore , the pulsar position at time @xmath120 is determined following its motion in the galactic gravitational potential . using the equations given by paczynski ( 1990 ) for given initial velocity ,",
    "the orbit integrations are performed by using the 4th order runge kutta method with variable time step @xcite on the variables @xmath113 , @xmath123 , @xmath112 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 . then the sky position and the distance of the simulated pulsar can be calculated .    7",
    "the inclination angle ( @xmath26 ) of each pulsar is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution ( biggs 1990 ) .",
    "8 the following radio selection effects are used .",
    "the pulsar must satisfy that its radio flux is greater than the radio survey flux threshold and its broadened pulse width is less than the rotation period ( e.g. sturner & dermer 1996 ) .",
    "* we calculate the 400 mhz radio luminosity , @xmath126 , of each model pulsar using the following distribution given by ( narayan & ostriker 1990 ) @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath126 is in units of mjy kpc@xmath130 .",
    "the minimum detectable average flux density , @xmath131 , of a pulsar s radio survey is estimated by using the method of sturner & dermer ( 1996 ) ( also see cheng & zhang 1998)*. the pulsar which satisfies @xmath132 is considered to be a radio - detectable pulsar , where @xmath126 is the radio luminosity at 400 mhz and @xmath75 is the distance to the pulsar .",
    "the radio beaming fraction can be expressed as ( emmering & chevalier 1989 ) @xmath133 , where @xmath134 ( e.g. biggs , 1990 ) is the half - angle of the radio emission cone .",
    "then , following emmering & chevalier ( 1989 ) , a sample pulsar with a given period @xmath27 is chosen in one out of @xmath135 cases using the monte carlo method .",
    "* there are growing evidence that very strong surface magnetic field exists on the surface of neutron stars . for examples , absorption",
    "/ emission line features have been observed in isolated pulsars / neutron stars , e.g .",
    "1e 1207.4 - 5209 ( sanwal et al .",
    "2002 ) , psr 1821 - 24 ( becker et al . 2003 ) and rbs1223 ( haberl et al . 2003 ) .",
    "these line features imply that the surface magnetic fields are one to two order of magnitude higher than that of the dipolar field .",
    "in fact , cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) have analyzed the x - ray emission from the polar cap regions of the rotation - powered pulsars and concluded that there exists a characteristic surface field with strength @xmath136 g .",
    "such strong surface magnetic field can easily affect the beaming direction of radio wave . * therefore , we assume that the beaming direction of @xmath0-rays is independent of the beaming direction of the radio .",
    "in general , it is possible that there is only one beaming , either the radio or the gamma - ray beam , pointing toward us .",
    "in fact this is one of key differences between outer gap model and polar gap model .",
    "the solid angle of @xmath0-rays is taken to be 1@xmath137 .",
    "9 the @xmath0-ray threshold varies over the sky .",
    "yadigaroglu & romani ( 1995 ) used a flux threshold of @xmath138 erg @xmath139s@xmath107 , which can compare to the faintest 5@xmath140 sources in the first egret catalog(fichtel et al .",

    "our results suggest that there should be more unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources identified as radio pulsars .",
    "in particular , the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey is expected to discovery more radio pulsars ( manchester et al .",

    "( 2001 ) have found five new possible radio pulsar - unidentified source associations .",
    "most recently , kramer et al . (",
    "2003 ) have used the newly release survey results to correlate the unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources and , have found more than 35 coincidences and around 20 probable associations .",
    "it is important to note that the number in each box of table 1 is sensitive to the input parameters , e.g. detection threshold , birth rate , initial distributions of pulsars etc . , for a given theoretical model .",
    "however , their ratios are less sensitive to most input parameters except their relative birth rate .",
    "it is interested to note that the @xmath0-ray pulsars in the gould belt contribute significant fraction of total @xmath0-ray pulsars for @xmath149 and become unimportant for @xmath5 .",

    "so we did not include these pulsars in the cumulative plot of energy flux .",
    "the maximum deviations of period , period derivative , magnetic field , distance and @xmath0-ray energy flux distributions from the observed distributions are 0.36 , 0.32 , 0.25 , 0.33 and 0.21 respectively .",
    "it can be seen that four of five accumulative distributions can not be rejected at better 80% confidence level , and period cumulative distribution can not be rejected at better than 90% confidence level .",
    "therefore we conclude that the model results do not conflict with the observed data of @xmath0-ray pulsars .    in fig .",

    "young @xmath0-ray pulsars will be dominated in the galactic plane , which have stronger @xmath0-ray luminosity , larger inclination angle , shorter period and larger magnetic field . in fig .",

    "it is because they are older and weaker @xmath0-ray pulsars , so they must be near otherwise they can not be detected .    in fig .",
    "7 , we plot @xmath100 versus @xmath101 , where the upper panel is @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath5 and lower panel is @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath149 .",
    "we can see that there are two distinctive regions . for @xmath151 erg / s ,",
    "the relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 is rather scattered .",
    "however , for @xmath152 erg / s , @xmath100 is proportional to @xmath101 . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray pulsars in high latitude , most pulsars satisfy @xmath153 , which means @xmath103 .",
    "this is supported by fig .",
    "6f , in which the fractional sizes of outer gap @xmath29 for @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath2 are all close to unity whereas the fractional sizes of outer gap for @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath5 have a wide distribution .",
    "if @xmath154 is used to fit all @xmath0-ray pulsars , then @xmath155 for @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath156 and @xmath9 for @xmath0-ray pulsars located at @xmath157 respectively . since the outer gap size is a function of @xmath158 . for young pulsars",
    ", there are more combination of these three parameters to make the outer gap size less than unity . on the other hand , for old @xmath0-ray",
    "pulsars their periods are already so long that there are not much room for other two parameters to vary the outer gap size away from unity .",
    "the spatial distributions of @xmath0-ray pulsars are given in fig .",
    "8 .    in fig .",
    "9a - d , we compare distributions of @xmath0-ray pulsars from the galaxy ( dotted lines ) and from the gould belt ( solid lines ) .",
    "we can see that the properties of @xmath0-ray pulsars from two sources are very similar except @xmath0-ray pulsars from the gould belt have lower population and closer .",
    "these two properties results from the lower birth rate in the gould belt and the solar system is inside the gould belt .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0-ray emission properties of pulsars in the galaxy as well as in the gould belt by using a new self - consistent outer gap model , which includes the effects of inclination angle and average properties of outer gap .",
    "we have found that this new model can produce more mature @xmath0-ray pulsars , which have longer period , smaller inclination angle and typical age of one million years old , than the old model .",
    "in fact the mature @xmath0-ray pulsars dominate in the high galactic latitude .",
    "the spectra of these mature pulsars are significantly softer and weaker than the young pulsars in the galactic plane .",
    "it is because the spectral hardness is roughly determined by the typical photon energy given in equation ( 1 ) , which characterizes the position of spectral break .",
    "the explicit form of how the typical photon energy depends on the inclination angle is given in equations ( 28 ) and ( 38 ) of zhang et al .",
    "although the form is quite complicated , we can roughly understand why smaller inclination angle gives smaller typical photon energy and hence * softer * spectrum by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is because the typical position of the outer gap is the null surface where becomes larger for smaller inclination angle . from the simulation results ,",
    "it is not clear why @xmath0-ray pulsars in high latitude should have smaller inclination angle .",
    "it is because all of these high latitude pulsars are older pulsars , which have longer period . without the compensation of the effect of inclination angle ,",
    "the fractional size of the outer gap @xmath29 is larger than unity ( cf . equation 3 ) . in order to maintain the outer gap size less than unity , @xmath64 in equation ( 4 ) , which contains the effect of inclination angle",
    "must be small .",
    "in fact @xmath64 becomes small for small inclination angle ( cf .",
    "fig . 1 of zhang et al .",
    "therefore high latitude gamma - ray pulsars tend to have smaller inclination angle and harder spectrum . on the other , this seems to imply that the confirmed radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars in the galactic plane should have larger inclination . this statistical correlation has not yet been established .",
    "but we would like to point out that the values of inclination angle of pulsars are very difficult to be measured accurately and there are only 7 confirmed @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "so it is very difficult to find such correlation in radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "however , we do believe that this correlation should be there when more radio - loud @xmath0-ray pulsars are discovered in the galactic plane .",
    "we have also used a monte carlo method to simulate the properties of the @xmath0-ray pulsar population in the galaxy as well as in the nearby gould belt in terms of the revised outer gap models .",
    "the initial magnetic field , spatial and velocity distributions of the neutron star at birth which are obtained by the radio pulsar statistical studies have been used in our simulations .",
    "we have obtained the spatial , distance , period , age , magnetic field , inclination angle , photon flux distributions of the radio - loud and radio - quiet @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "we find that the properties of @xmath0-ray pulsars between @xmath5 and @xmath6 are very much different .",
    "galactic plane @xmath0-ray pulsars are younger , shorter in period and have larger inclination angles .",
    "they satisfy different relation between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the high latitude @xmath0-ray pulsars satisfy @xmath159 but the galactic plane pulsars satisfy @xmath160 .",
    "the present model predicts very similar numbers of @xmath0-ray pulsars as old models but many more high latitude @xmath0-ray pulsars than old models ( cheng & zhang 1998 ; zhang , zhang & cheng 2000 ) .",
    "it is because the new model allows the outer gap can exist about a few million years old for appropriate combination of b , p and @xmath26 , so old @xmath0-ray pulsars can move up to high galactic latitude .",
    "furthermore , the nearby gould belt also contribute significant number of @xmath0-ray pulsars in high latitude .",
    "torres et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have predicted that agile can detect more @xmath0-ray pulsars ( for a general review of agile cf .",
    "tavani et al .",
    "2001 ) . perhaps agile",
    "can provide some clues to differentiate polar gap model predictions ( gonthier et al .",
    "2002 ) and outer gap model predictions , and glast makes the final verdict . finally we would like to remark that the better predictions on how many @xmath0-ray pulsars should be detected by agile and glast should include a better expression of @xmath0-ray solid angle , which depends on the inclination angle as well as the outer gap size .",
    "however , in order to have a reliable expression of @xmath0-ray solid angle , we need to carry out three - dimensional model calculation and come up with an approximate expression from monte carlo simulation .",
