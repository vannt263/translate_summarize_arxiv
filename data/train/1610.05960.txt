    "this paper is devoted to the performance analysis of a class of single server queueing systems with multiple customer types .",
    "our motivation is twofold : ( i ) to obtain insight into the performance of certain switches in optical communication systems , and ( ii ) to obtain insight into the effect of having particular reservation periods , windows of opportunity during which a customer can make a reservation for service .",
    "our class of queueing systems combines several features , viz . , polling , retrials , and the new feature of so - called glue periods or reservation periods .",
    "these will first be discussed separately , while their relation to optical switching will also be outlined .",
    "polling systems are queueing models in which a single server , alternatingly , visits a finite number of , say , @xmath5 queues ( or stations ) in some prescribed order .",
    "polling systems have been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "for example , various different service disciplines ( rules which describe the server s behaviour while visiting a queue ) have been considered , both for models with and without switchover times between queues .",
    "we refer to takagi @xcite and vishnevskii and semenova @xcite for literature reviews and to boon , van der mei and winands @xcite , levy and sidi @xcite and takagi @xcite for overviews of the applicability of polling systems .",
    "switches in communication systems form an important application area of polling systems . here",
    ", packets must be routed from source to destination , passing through a series of links and nodes . in copper - based transmission links , packets from various sources are time - multiplexed , and this may be modelled by a polling system . in recent years",
    "optical networking has become very important , because optical fibers offer major advantages with respect to copper cables : huge bandwidth , ultra - low losses and an extra dimension , viz . , a choice of wavelengths .    when one wants to model the performance of an optical switch by a polling system @xcite , one is faced with the following difficulty .",
    "buffering of optical packets is not easy , as photons can not wait .",
    "whenever there is a need to buffer photons , they are sent into a local fiber loop , thus providing a small delay to the photons without losing or displacing them .",
    "if , at the completion of the loop , a photon still needs to be buffered , it is again sent into the fiber delay loop , etc . from a queueing theoretic perspective , this raises the need to add the feature of _ retrial queue _ to a polling system : instead of having a queueing system with one server and @xmath5 ordinary queues , it has one server and @xmath5 retrial queues .",
    "retrial queues have received much attention in the literature , see , e.g. , the books by falin and templeton @xcite and by artalejo and gomez - corral @xcite , but they have hardly been studied in the setting of polling models .",
    "langaris @xcite has pioneered the study of polling models with retrial queues",
    ". however , for our purpose - the performance analysis of optical switches - his assumptions about the service discipline of the server at the various queues are not suitable .",
    "a third important feature in the present paper is that of so - called glue or reservation periods .",
    "just before the server arrives at a station there is some glue period .",
    "customers ( both new arrivals and retrying customers ) arriving at the station during this glue period  stick \" and will be served during the visit of the server . customers arriving at the station in any other period join the orbit of that station and will retry after an exponentially distributed time .",
    "one motivation for studying glue periods is the following . a sophisticated technology that one might try to add to the use of fiber delay loops in optical networking is _ varying the speed of light by changing the refractive index of the fiber loop _ , cf",
    "using a higher refractive index in a small part of the loop one can achieve ` slow light ' , which implies slowing down the packets .",
    "this feature is in our model incorporated as glue periods , where we slow down the packets arriving at the end of the fiber loop just before the server arrives , so that they do not have to retry but get served during the subsequent visit period .",
    "not restricting ourselves to optical networks , one can also interpret a glue period as a reservation period , i.e. , a period in which customers can make a reservation at a station for service in the subsequent visit period of that station . in our model , the reservation period immediately precedes the visit period , and could be seen as the last part of a switchover period .",
    "a first attempt to study a polling model which combines retrials and glue periods is @xcite , which mainly focuses on the case of a single server and a single station , but also outlines how that analysis can be extended to the case of two stations . in @xcite an @xmath5-station polling model with retrials and with constant glue periods",
    "is considered , for the case of gated service discipline at all stations .",
    "the gated discipline is an important discipline in polling systems ; it implicates that the server , when visiting a station , serves exactly those customers which were present upon his arrival . the steady - state joint station size ( i.e.",
    ", the number of customers in each station ) distribution was derived in @xcite , both at an arbitrary epoch and at beginnings of switchover , glue and visit periods . in the current paper",
    "we present an algorithm to obtain the moments of the station size for the case of exponentially distributed glue periods . using little s law , that also gives mean sojourn times .",
    "thereafter for each individual station we allow generally distributed glue periods and we focus our attention on other performance measures next to station sizes . in particular , we consider the steady - state distribution of the total workload in the system , which leads us to a pseudo conservation law , i.e. , an exact expression for a weighted sum of the mean waiting times at all stations .",
    "we use that pseudo conservation law to derive an accurate approximation for the individual mean waiting times .",
    "we further consider the problem of choosing the lengths of the glue periods , given the total glue period in a cycle , so as to minimize a weighted sum of the mean waiting times .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_model ]",
    "we present a model description .",
    "section [ section_old ] contains a detailed analysis for generating functions and moments of station sizes at different time epochs when the glue periods are exponentially distributed .",
    "we also present a numerical example , which in particular provides insight into the behavior of the polling system in the case of long glue periods . in section [ section_new ]",
    "we derive a pseudo conservation law for a system with generally distributed glue periods .",
    "subsequently we use this pseudo conservation law for deriving an approximation for the mean waiting times at all stations . in its turn , this approximation is used to minimize weighted sums of the mean waiting times by optimally choosing the lengths of the glue periods , given the total glue period per cycle .",
    "finally , section  [ section_concl ] lists some topics for further research .",
    "we consider a single server cyclic polling system with retrials and so - called glue periods .",
    "this model was first introduced in @xcite for a single station vacation model and a two - station model with switchover times .",
    "further in @xcite this was extended to an @xmath5-station model with switchover times . in both papers ,",
    "the model was studied for deterministic glue periods .",
    "we index the stations by @xmath0 , @xmath6 , in the order of server movement .",
    "for ease of presentation , all references to station indices greater than @xmath5 or less than @xmath7 are implicitly assumed to be modulo @xmath5 .",
    "customers arrive at station @xmath0 according to a poisson process with rate @xmath8 ; they are called type-@xmath0 customers , @xmath9 .",
    "the overall arrival rate is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the service times at station @xmath0 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables with a generic random variable @xmath11 , @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath12 $ ] be the laplace - stieltjes transform ( lst ) of the service time distribution at station @xmath0 .",
    "the switchover times from station @xmath0 to station @xmath13 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a generic random variable @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 $ ] be the lst of the switchover time from station @xmath0 to station @xmath13 , @xmath6 .",
    "the interarrival times , the service times , and the switchover times are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "after a switch of the server to station @xmath0 , there is a glue period for collecting retrying customers ( which will be followed by the visit period of the server to station @xmath0 ) .",
    "we assume that the successive glue periods at station @xmath0 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with a generic random variable @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 $ ] be the lst of the glue period distribution at station @xmath0 .",
    "each station consists of an orbit and a queue .",
    "when customers ( both new arrivals and retrying customers ) arrive at station @xmath0 during a glue period , they stick and wait in the queue to get served during the visit of the server to that station .",
    "when customers arrive at station @xmath0 in any other period , they join the orbit of station @xmath0 and will retry after a random amount of time .",
    "the inter - retrial time of each customer in the orbit of station @xmath0 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath18 and is independent of all other processes .",
    "a single server cyclically moves from one station to another serving the glued customers at each of the stations .",
    "the service discipline at all stations is gated . during the service period of station @xmath0 , the server serves all glued customers in the queue of station @xmath0 , i.e. , all type-@xmath0 customers waiting at the end of the glue period ( but none of those in orbit , and neither any new arrivals ) .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the vector of numbers of customers of type @xmath7 to type @xmath5 in the system ( hence in the orbit ) at the start of a glue period of station @xmath0 , @xmath9 , in steady state .",
    "further , let @xmath20 denote the vector of numbers of customers of type @xmath7 to type @xmath5 in the system at the start of a visit period at station @xmath0 , @xmath9 , in steady state .",
    "we distinguish between those who are queueing ( glued ) and those who are in the orbit of station @xmath0 : we write @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes in the queue and @xmath24 denotes in the orbit . finally , let @xmath25 denote the vector of numbers of customers of type @xmath7 to type @xmath5 in the system ( hence in the orbit ) at the start of a switchover from station @xmath0 to station @xmath13 , @xmath22 , in steady state .",
    "the utilization of the server at station @xmath0 , @xmath26 , is defined by @xmath27 $ ] and the total utilization of the server @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "it can be shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for stability of this polling system is @xmath30 .",
    "we hence assume that @xmath31 .",
    "the cycle length of station @xmath0 , @xmath32 is defined as the time between two successive arrivals of the server at this station .",
    "the mean cycle length , @xmath33 $ ] , is independent of the station involved ( and the service discipline ) and is given by @xmath34=\\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1 } ( { \\mathbb{e}}[g_i]+{\\mathbb{e}}[s_i])}{1-\\rho } ,   \\label{eqn - c }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be derived as follows : since the probability of the server being idle ( in steady state ) is @xmath35 , and this equals @xmath36+{\\mathbb{e}}[s_i])}{\\mathbb{e}[c]}$ ] by the theory of regenerative processes , we have .",
    "in @xcite the authors calculated the generating functions and the mean values of the number of customers at different time epochs when the glue periods are deterministic . in this section",
    "we assume that the glue periods are _ exponentially _ distributed with mean @xmath37 = 1/\\gamma_i$ ] , @xmath38 .",
    "we will derive a set of partial differential equations for the joint generating function of the station size ( i.e. , the number of customers in each station ) and then obtain a system of linear equations for the first and the second moments of the station size .",
    "we also provide an iterative algorithm for solving the system of linear equations .",

    "the idea in this approximation is that an arriving customer first has to wait for the residual cycle time , until the server begins a new visit to its station .",
    "subsequently , it has to wait for the service times of all customers of the same type , who arrived before it , in the elapsed cycle time .",
    "this leads to @xmath238 = ( 1 + \\rho_j ) { \\mathbb{e}}[r_{c_j}]$ ] , where @xmath239 $ ] is the mean of the residual time of a cycle starting with a visit to station @xmath51 , which is the same as the mean of the elapsed time of a cycle starting with a visit to station @xmath51 .",
    "next , everitt assumed that for all @xmath51 , this mean residual cycle time is independent of @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath239 \\approx { \\mathbb{e}}[r_{c}]$ ] , leading to the approximation @xmath238 \\approx ( 1 + \\rho_j ) { \\mathbb{e}}[r_{c}]$ ] for the model without retrials and glue periods .    in this paper , we introduce a similar type of approximation , including one extra term , for the mean waiting times in the model with retrials and glue periods : @xmath240 \\approx ( 1+\\rho_j ) { \\mathbb{e}}[r_c ] + \\frac{\\tilde g_j ( \\nu_j)}{1-\\tilde g_j ( \\nu_j ) } \\left({\\mathbb{e}}[c ] - { \\mathbb{e}}[g_j]\\right ) .",

    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ approx_time _ ] ) is the same as the term in @xcite .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side is added because not every customer who arrives in a particular cycle receives service in that cycle .",
    "the type-@xmath51 customers arriving during any period other than the glue period of station @xmath51 receive service in the following visit period with probability @xmath241 .",
    "furthermore , the type-@xmath51 customers arriving during any period other than a glue period of station @xmath51 , have to wait for a geometric number ( with parameter @xmath241 ) of cycles before receiving service .",
    "since a type-@xmath51 customer arrives during a period other than a glue period of station @xmath51 with probability @xmath242-{\\mathbb{e}}[g_j]}{{\\mathbb{e}}[c]}$ ] , the mean number of cycles until an arbitrary type-@xmath51 customer receives its service , is @xmath242-{\\mathbb{e}}[g_j]}{{\\mathbb{e}}[c]}\\times \\frac{\\tilde g_j ( \\nu_j)}{1-\\tilde g_j ( \\nu_j)}$ ] .",
    "the second term is obtained by multiplying this mean number of cycles and the mean cycle time .",
    "it should be noted that , in reality , the mean residual cycle times for station @xmath0 and station @xmath51 ( @xmath243 ) are not equal .",
    "a key element of our approximation is to assume that they _ are _ equal .",
