    "in statistical disclosure control of microdata sets , swapping of observations among records is considered to be a convenient disclosure control technique , especially because it preserves one - dimensional marginals .",
    "data swapping was introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered optimal pairing of close records of a microdata set to perform swapping . as explained in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", swapping has a close connection to the theory of markov bases for contingency tables .",
    "see @xcite for a review of disclosure control techniques for microdata sets .",
    "suppose that a statistical agency is considering to grant access to a microdata set to some researchers and the data set contains some rare and risky records .",
    "we consider the case that all variables of the data set have been already categorized .",
    "swapping of observations is one of the useful techniques of protecting these records .",
    "if some marginals from the data set have been already published , it is desirable to perform the swapping in such a way that the swapping does not disturb the published marginal frequencies .",
    "therefore it is important to determine , whether it is possible to perform swapping of risky records under the restriction that some marginal are fixed .",
    "see @xcite for a realistic example of the need for swapping .",
    "feasibility of swapping under the restriction that some marginal are fixed depends on the set of fixed marginals .",
    "we here illustrate this point by a simple hypothetical example .",
    "suppose that a microdata set contains the following two records .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     then all 4 records are changed but all two - dimensional marginals are preserved .",
    "in fact this example correspond to a basic move of degree 4 ( @xcite ) of the markov basis for @xmath0 contingency tables with fixed two - dimensional marginals .",
    "more complicated examples can be given by translating the moves of @xmath1 tables of @xcite .",
    "@xcite proved that there exists a markov basis consisting of primitive moves for decomposable models .",
    "this implies the following fact in the case of decomposable models .",
    "if a particular record can be changed by swaps possibly involving more than 2 records , then it is always possible to change the record by a swap involving the record and another single record .    on the other hand @xcite",
    "have shown that that primitive moves do not form a markov basis for non - decomposable models .",
    "this implies that for non - decomposable models , there is a possibility of swapping of a sample unique record involving more than 2 records , even if it can not be swapped with another single record that can be checked by algorithm [ algorithm1 ] of section [ subsec : searching ] .",
    "the theory of markov basis is concerned with the swappability of all records with arbitrary marginal counts .",
    "the investigation of this paper just asks whether a particular sample unique record can be swapped with other records in a particular data set",
    ". therefore the problem considered here should be much easier than the problem of construction of markov bases for general hierarchical models of contingency tables .",
    "still it is not clear at this point how to construct a practical algorithm for checking swappability of a particular record involving other two records , other three records etc .",
    "this problem is left for our future research .",
    "an effective @xmath2-swapping ( [ eq : swapping - e ] ) changes the cell frequencies of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 into @xmath7 hence the difference between the post - swapped and the pre - swapped tables is a primitive move . if @xmath2-swapping fixes all @xmath8-marginals , the corresponding primitive move also fixes them .",
    "next we consider to show that any primitive move ( [ eq : prim1 ] ) for @xmath8 can be expressed by @xmath2-swapping ( [ eq : swapping - e ] ) for some @xmath9 .",
    "write @xmath10 we first show that @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath13 , there exists @xmath14 for any @xmath15 such that @xmath15 belongs to @xmath16 . in the case where @xmath17 , two records of @xmath18 have to be preserved in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "hence @xmath21 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath22 , each one record of both @xmath18 and @xmath23 have to be preserved in @xmath24 , which implies @xmath25",
    ". therefore we have @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
