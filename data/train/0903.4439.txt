    "an immediate consequence of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is that there will be three goldstone bosons : the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "since the up and down quarks are not exactly massless these pions are also not massless , but , to the extent that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are small compared to @xmath7 , the pions will be much lighter than all other hadronic degrees of freedom .",

    "these loops are divergent , but the degree of divergence is mandated by the power of momentum carried by the vertices , and the behavior of the heavy - baryon and meson propagators .",
    "dimensional analysis , combined with the usual topological identities for feynman graphs , shows that a @xmath8pt graph with @xmath83 loops , @xmath84 vertices from the @xmath16 lagrangian of dimension @xmath85 , and @xmath86 vertices from the @xmath87n lagrangian of dimension @xmath85 has a total degree of divergence : @xmath88 with @xmath89 the number of nucleons .",

    "i will not attempt to do justice to that effort here , since only a few of the many contact interactions that occur in @xmath102 and @xmath103 enter the results presented below .",
    "i want to stress , though , that it is through such counterterms that hadronic states with excitation energies @xmath104 affect @xmath8pt s predictions .",
    "these states therefore produce effects that are slowly varying with respect to the external kinematic parameter @xmath25 or @xmath23 , while the rapid variation of measurable quantities with @xmath25 and @xmath23 is provided by pion - cloud physics .",
    "this interplay of the chiral physics with the higher - energy hadron dynamics is captured in @xmath8pt , without the need for any assumptions about the details of that dynamics .",

    "it is beneficial to treat the interactions that bind the nucleus within the same framework as that used to describe the chiral structure of the nucleon itself .",
    "this can be done in chiral perturbation theory , which not only provides a means to compute the low - energy interaction of photons and pions with nucleons , but also is used to calculate the forces between nucleons .",
    "this is the framework that will be used , e.g. in section  [ sec - compton ] , to compute photon interactions with multi - nucleon systems , and we provide a brief summary of it here .",
    "the first attempt in this direction was due to weinberg  @xcite .",
    "weinberg pointed out that hb@xmath8pt could not be employed directly to compute the nucleon - nucleon amplitude , because a nucleon in a typical nuclear bound state has @xmath105 thus not all components of the ( residual ) nucleon four - momentum @xmath53 are order @xmath14 , in contrast to the case inside a typical hb@xmath8pt loop graph .",
    "because of the scaling ( [ eq : nucscaling ] ) a different organization of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lpin1 ] ) plus ( [ eq : lpin2 ] ) is required when treating nn interactions .",
    "the single - nucleon propagator becomes : @xmath106 i.e. the usual non - relativistic propagator for a free particle of mass @xmath39 .",
    "weinberg further observed that in the regime ( [ eq : nucscaling ] ) this non - relativistic propagator scales as @xmath107 , which invalidates the degree - of - divergence formula ( [ eq : chiptpc ] ) .",
    "however , if we consider only diagrams for @xmath108 that do not contain an intermediate two - nucleon state  the so - called ` two - particle irreducible ' ( 2pi ) graphs  then all single - nucleon propagators have @xmath109 , and eq .  ( [ eq : chiptpc ] ) can be used .",
    "the goal thus becoomes to compute the 2pi nn amplitude up to a fixed chiral dimension @xmath91 . in order to do this",
    "we must supplement @xmath99 and @xmath97 by a nucleon - nucleon lagrangian that contains the effects of short - distance ( @xmath110 ) physics in the two - nucleon system .",
    "this physics appears as a string of nn contact interactions of increasing mass dimension , each of which has an lec associated with it .",
    "we then identify the nn potential @xmath111 at order @xmath91 as the sum of all 2pi @xmath112 graphs ",
    "loops plus contacts  up to that order .",
    "( technically an extra step is desirable here , with the 2pi amplitude transformed into an energy - independent potential using e.g. the okubo formalism  @xcite . )",
    "the full nn amplitude is then reconstructed from its 2pi parts via : @xmath113 where an integral over @xmath114 has been performed to combine the two single - nucleon propagators into the propagator of an nn state of energy @xmath115 . since eq .",

    "@xcite , where the leading effects of delta(1232 ) excitation were added to the @xmath202d calculation .",

    "the focus was on photon energies in the 60120 mev range , and the formula ( [ eq : wein ] ) was used .",
    "this , then , was a first , exploratory , study that sought to examine what information compton experiments using a helium-3 target could give us about neutron polarizabilities .",
    "once again the @xmath244 and @xmath245 were computed up to @xmath70 , and a variety of potentials were employed in the calculation of @xmath275 .",
    "the first conclusion from this study is that helium-3 will have a significantly larger cross section for coherent compton scattering than deuterium , due to the presence of two protons in the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , the thomson terms of these two protons can interefere with the neutron polarizability pieces of the @xmath202n amplitude , so these pieces have a larger effect than in @xmath202d scattering  at least in absolute terms .",
    "in addition , polarized helium-3 is unique and interesting because it seems to behave as an  effective polarized neutron \" in compton scattering .",
    "the compton response is  at least up to @xmath70dominated by the nuclear configuration where the two protons are paired in a relative s - wave , and the spin of the nucleus is carried by the neutron . and two - body currents at this order are largely spin independent .",

    "measurement of these obseravbles is a high priority for hi@xmath202s , along with polarized @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "the idea is that the @xmath283 experiments will reveal proton spin polarizabilities , which can then be compared to the neutron ones measured in the @xmath284 experiments .",
    "a different combination of neutron spin polarizabilities can be accessed through double - polarization measurements on the deuterium nucleus  @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of coherent helium-3 compton scattering measurements at max - lab in the near future .",
    "this allows us to anticipate the measurement of several neutron spin polarizabilities , with the consequent possibility of examining differences between proton and neutron @xmath285 s .",
    "there is also progress on the extraction of information on these quantities from lattice qcd  @xcite , and so such experiments could provide important insights into the interplay of goldstone - boson and higher - energy qcd dynamics in nucleon compton scattering .",
    "electron scattering from the neutron provides the opportunity to map out its electromagnetic structure as a function of @xmath177 , the square of the space - like momentum transfer in the reaction .",
    "neutron compon scattering provides a different picture , as we probe neutron structure as a function of photon energy @xmath23 . in both cases",
    "the rapid variation of response functions with the kinematic parameter is driven by the neutron s pion cloud .",
    "slower variation comes from excitations of higher energy . the review of ref .",
    "@xcite places greater emphasis on the role of those higher - energy degrees of freedom , and also covers a wider swath of kinematical territory , than does this article .",
    "the understanding of the nucleon s electromagnetic response i have presented here is based on the chiral symmetry of qcd , and the status of pions as goldstone bosons of that symmetry .",
    "however , since chiral symmetry is only an approximate symmetry of the qcd lagrangian , the  slow \" variation from more massive degrees of freedom can , on occasion , be just as fast as that due to pions , see e.g. the problem of the magnetic response of the nucleon in compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "it is critical that we test and elucidate the consequences of qcd associated with this physics for both neutrons and protons .",
    "chiral perturbation theory systematically implements the interplay of pion - cloud and shorter - distance mechanisms in nucleon structure .",
    "it predicts definite patterns for proton and neutron observables , e.g. that it is the isovector combination of form factors that has the dominant effects due to chiral symmetry , or that proton and neutron polarizabilities are equal at leading order .",
    "the calculations and experiments reported on here show that a picture of neutron structure based on chiral symmetry provides a good qualitative understanding of the neutron s electromagnetic excitation already at the leading one - loop level .",
    "that picture can be rendered quantitatively accurate if some care is taken to include the dominant short - distance mechanisms , e.g. those due to the delta(1232 ) , through use of the chiral effective field theories developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an obvious extension of the tests discussed here is to examine the neutron s response as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath177 _",
    "simultaneously_. this has been done for the proton , through @xmath286 or  virtual compton scattering \" ( vcs ) experiments .",
    "chiral perturbation theory up to @xmath70 provides a good description of the lowest-@xmath177 experiment of this type  @xcite . at this order ,",
    "@xmath8pt not only correctly predicts the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the proton to within experimental uncertainties , it also predicts the spatial distribution of the polarizability response within the proton  @xcite .",
    "the theory also predicts that the neutron s generalized polarizabilities are the same as the proton s at this order .",
    "experiments to test this prediction would be very timely , and could be accomplished through a vcs experiment on the deuteron , together with a calculation of the two - body corrections to @xmath70 . more ambitiously , generalized neutron spin polarizabilities could perhaps be extracted from vcs experiments of the type recently undertaken at mainz in the proton case  @xcite , but with the proton replaced by a helium-3 target .",
    "of course , the most direct evidence for the chiral structure of the neutron comes from pion - production reactions .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath287 is given to very good accuracy by the leading chiral effect : the  kroll - ruderman \" term . in this case",
    "@xmath70 , where the leading - loop contributions appear , is two orders beyond leading and interesting short - distance effects also enter at this order  @xcite . the @xmath70 amplitude for charged - pion photoproduction on the neutron can be compared to experiment by examining data on pion capture by the proton  data which is in good agreement with the @xmath8pt result .",
    "an approved experiment at the max - lab facility in lund , sweden , will soon measure the energy dependence of the near - threshold cross section for @xmath288 to good accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this should provide useful information on the charged - pion photoproduction reaction on the neutron , although again , this one - body part of the amplitude will have to be disentangled from nn mechanisms .",
    "finally , one of the most beautiful pieces of evidence in neutron dynamics regarding the pattern of chiral - symmetry breaking occurs in the reaction @xmath289 .",
    "this is predicted to have a large threshold @xmath290 amplitude , in spite of the absence of any neutron charge , because of the impact of the two - step process @xmath291even though the threshold for @xmath3 production is below the charged - pion threshold .",
    "hb@xmath8pt predicts the neutron @xmath290 , based on the one - loop dynamics corresponding to this process , as well as the measured proton value , @xmath292 , and the assumption that the short - distance physics in the proton and neutron reactions is the same ( apart from obvious isospin factors ) .",
    "the result  which includes terms up to @xmath71 in hb@xmath8pt  is  @xcite : @xmath293    hb@xmath8pt s prediction for @xmath289 can be tested in @xmath294 .",
    "but , a consistent calculation of the threshold s - wave amplitude for neutral - pion photoproduction on deuterium , @xmath295 , requires the inclusion of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 mechanisms for @xmath296  @xcite .",
    "these diagrams include the double - scattering contributions that are the two - body counterpart of the diagrams that in the single - nucleon case lead to the large neutron @xmath290 .",
    "@xmath8et up to @xmath71 then predicts:@xmath297 the uncertainty comes from the experimental error on @xmath292 and the variation in the result with different nn - system wave functions .",
    "( note there are other higher - order uncertainties that are _ not _ included in this error bar . ) using a sequence of measurements at energies up to 20 mev above threshold  @xcite to obtain @xmath295 , and then using the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammadpi0dth ] ) to convert this to a result for the threshold @xmath298 amplitude , we find : @xmath299 with an additional , here unquantified , uncertainty arising from the subtraction of the inelastic channel that was employed in ref .",
    "the reasonable level of agreement between the @xmath71 prediction ( [ eq : e0pluspi0n ] ) and the measurement ( [ eq : gammadpi0dexpt ] ) shows that we understand the chiral dynamics of the neutron , as revealed in @xmath294 at threshold , quite well .",
    "unfortunately the situation in @xmath300 is not quite as clear  @xcite . for the case of threshold pions and low momentum transfer , a successful description",
    "could reasonably have been expected , since the pion cloud should also dominate this process . however , there are puzzling discrepanices between theory and data already for @xmath180 gev@xmath181 .",
    "it is hoped that careful treatment of the nn system dynamics , together with a thorough examination of the delta(1232 ) mechanisms that enter this process , can explain why the pion cloud dominates @xmath294 , but is in competition with higher - energy qcd dynamics in the case of electro - production .",
    "studies that explore these issues will ensure that photo- and electro - production continue to provide important windows on the chiral structure of the neutron . a unified picture of low - energy and low - momentum - transfer neutron structure as revealed in these reactions , as well as neutron compton scattering ( real and virtual ) , and the neutron electromagnetic form factors has been established .",
    "this picture  which is systematized by chiral perturbation theory  is grounded in qcd and agrees with data in all these reactions at the expected level given the @xmath8pt order to which calculations have been accomplished thus far .",
    "ongoing efforts in both theory and experiment  and continued dialogue between them  will elucidate further details of neutron structure , and so improve our understanding of qcd in its strongly - interacting regime .",
