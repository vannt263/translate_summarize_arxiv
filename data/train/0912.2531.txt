    "for such a hierarchical epistatic structure , we observe , as a function of increasing crossover rate @xmath9 , a sequence of two transitions which define , sandwiched between cc and qle , an intermediate modular selection ( ms ) regime , where the genome - wide ld characteristic of the cc regime has broken down to a set of modular blocks which are in quasi linkage equilibrium with each other .",

    "our results not only apply to the transition between genotype and allele selection , but also to localized clusters of interacting genes on the chromosome .",
    "whenever the epistatic fitness difference between different allelic compositions of a cluster exceeds the recombination rate of the cluster , the fittest will amplify exponentially .",
    "since such clusters are often small @xcite ( @xmath73 mb ) their recombination rates are low ( cm or less ) - hence fitness differentials below one percent can suffice to establish cc dynamics .",

    "<S> the qle dynamics was first described by kimura @xcite in the limit of weak selection / fast recombination for a pair of bi - allelic loci and subsequently generalized to multi - loci systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of a collective behavior involving linkage disequilibrium on many loci and selection effectively acting on the whole chromosome as a unit has been pointed out before in the context of overdominance by franklin and lewontin @xcite in the strong selection limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , these studies of the two different limits do not reveal the breakdown of qle and the transition to cc as the generic behavior of multi - locus epistatic systems .    to underscore the general nature of the results , we shall consider two different models of epistasis . </S>",
    "<S> the first model will follow the common treatment of epistasis in quantitative traits which assumes that the epistatic contribution to fitness is disrupted when the parental genes are mixed in sexual reproduction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption becomes exact when the epistatic component of fitness of a specific genotype is a random number ( which depends on the genotype , but is fixed in time ) and we shall call this model the random epistasis ( re ) model . within the re model , </S>",
    "<S> any change in the genotype randomizes the epistatic component of fitness so that the latter is not heritable when non - identical parents mate . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , faithfully passed on to the offspring in asexual reproduction . </S>",
    "<S> for the re model , genomes are propagated asexually with probability @xmath7 and with probability @xmath8 are a product of mating where all genes are reassorted , as would be exactly correct if all genes were on different chromosomes . </S>",
    "<S> this model of facultative mating approximates reproductive strategies common in fungi ( e.g. yeast ) or nematodes and plants . as a more realistic alternative </S>",
    "<S> , we shall also study a model with only pairwise interactions between loci @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this pairwise epistasis ( pe ) model allows epistatic contribution to be partly heritable , as interacting pairs have a chance to be inherited together @xcite . for the pe model , we assume that all genes are arranged on one chromosome with a uniform crossover rate @xmath9 , which allows us to explore haplotype block formation and implications for recombination rate evolution </S>",
    "<S> .    the strength of selection is determined by the variance @xmath10 of the distribution of fitness in the population . within our models , the fitness @xmath11 of a genotype @xmath12 is the sum of an additive component @xmath13 representing independent contributions of alleles and an epistatic part @xmath14 . for the re model , </S>",
    "<S> the latter is a random number drawn from gaussian distribution , while for the pe model it is a sum of pairwise interactions with random coefficients @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the variances @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 add up to @xmath10 and their relative magnitude determines the importance of additive effects compared to epistasis . the two different models and their parameters </S>",
    "<S> are given explicitly in the methods section . </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of simplicity , we assume haploid genomes . </S>",
    "<S> random and pairwise epistasis represent two opposite extremes in the complexity of epistasis . while the pairwise model is more realistic , the generic behavior is most clearly demonstrated using the re model with random gene reassortment and facultative mating . </S>"
