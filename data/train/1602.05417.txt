    "the experiments to produce ultrahigh magnetic fields using magnetic cumulative generators ( flux compression generators ) , pioneered by a.d .",
    "sakharov @xcite and c.m .",
    "fowler @xcite , gave rise to a rapidly developing research area related to high energy density physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of these experiments is the use of fast - moving under explosion shells ( shock waves ) to compress the magnetic field .",
    "for example , in helical flux compression generators ( fcgs ) , the compressed magnetic field proves trapped between the solenoid and the liner . from the electrodynamical viewpoint , the closed region containing a magnetic ( an electromagnetic ) field and undergoing compression is a resonator with moving boundary .",
    "the transformation of a microwave field during the compression of a cylindrical resonator was first studied by l.p .",
    "feoktistov and v.v .",
    "klimov in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite derived the explicit expression describing the electromagnetic field inside the resonator in a particular case of axisymmetric mode @xmath0 @xmath1 of a compressed cylindrical resonator whose walls move at constant velocity and showed that the energy of the field in the resonator increases , because the frequency of the field is increased .",
    "let us note here that the structure of fcg resonators can be more complicated .",
    "the helical fcg , for example , is a coaxial resonator whose mode structure differs considerably from that of a cylindrical resonator . in particular , multiply - connected cross section leads to the presence of a @xmath2 wave .",
    "the coaxial resonator can be considered as a section of a coaxial waveguide with closed boundaries , and telegraph equations can be applied to analyze oscillations in the resonator . however , commonly - known telegraph equations @xcite are formulated for the case when the geometric dimensions of the line ( coaxial waveguide ) are time - independent .    in this paper , we derived telegraph equations to describe the compression of a @xmath2 wave for the case of a waveguide ( resonator ) with moving boundary .",
    "the derived equations are used to analyze how the oscillations of the compressed electromagnetic field depend on the parameters of the resonator .",
    "let us consider a circuit moving in the electromagnetic field with a velocity @xmath3 . due to relativistic effects ,",
    "the current induced in the conductor is @xcite @xmath4\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the electric field strength and @xmath6 is the magnetic inductance .",
    "it follows from ( [ n1 ] ) that the electromotive force acting in a moving closed circuit is @xcite @xmath7\\right ) d\\vec l.\\ ] ] according to faraday s law , the electromotive force ( [ n2 ] ) equals the time rate of change of magnetic flux @xmath8 : @xmath9 taking the time derivative in ( [ n1 ] ) , we should allow for the total change of the magnetic flux through the circuit ( associated with both time change of the magnetic inductance and change in the position of the circuit ) @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the inductance per unit length @xmath12 and capacitance of the unit length @xmath13 of the line . because the dimensions of the waveguide ( the moving line ) depend on time , @xmath14 and @xmath15 also depend on time .",
    "the inductance and capacitance of the waveguide section of length @xmath10 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath18 is the current .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath8 through the circuit @xmath19 is @xmath20 this yields @xmath21 let us make use of the equality @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the resistance of the unit length of the line and @xmath24 is the voltage between the conductors .    as a result",
    ", we have @xmath25 the charge @xmath26 of the section having the length @xmath10 is given by @xmath27 . using the charge density continuity equation ,",
    "we can obtain the following equality : @xmath28 here @xmath29 , as in well as in the line with time - constant capacitance , describes the leakage current . in a similar manner as in the case of constant parameters of the system @xcite",
    ", we can present the system under consideration in terms of the limit of the set of sequential elements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this equation set together with the initial and boundary conditions allows finding the current and voltage in a coaxial resonator ( waveguide , line ) with moving conductors ( with time and coordinate - dependent @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath23 , and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the derivative @xmath31 acts as resistance ( in the same manner as in the situation known in the theory of fcg @xcite ) .",
    "the derivative @xmath32 has an effect on the leakage currents , which can lead to the increase in the current instead of the drop in the case when @xmath33 .",
    "now let us assume that the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath23 , and @xmath29 are all independent of the coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "by differentiation of ( [ n8 ] ) with respect to the coordinate @xmath34 , we can obtain the following second - order equations for voltage and current : @xmath35\\frac{\\partial   u}{\\partial t}\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(l_0\\frac{\\partial   c_0}{\\partial t}\\right ) + \\frac{\\partial l_0 g_0 } { \\partial t}+   r_0 \\frac{\\partial c_0}{\\partial t}+r_0 g_0 \\right ] u ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath36\\frac{\\partial   i}{\\partial t}\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(c_0\\frac{\\partial   l_0}{\\partial t}\\right ) + \\frac{\\partial c_0 r_0}{\\partial t }   +   g_0 \\frac{\\partial l_0}{\\partial t}+g_0 r_0 \\right ] i ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we shall recall here that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the wave s phase velocity .",
    "equations ( [ n9 ] ) and ( [ n10 ] ) hold true when @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath23 , and @xmath29 are independent of @xmath34",
    ". otherwise we should apply ( [ n8 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the coaxial resonator ( waveguide section , line ) with time - independent length @xmath39 and varying transverse dimensions .",
    "because the coefficients on the right - hand side of equations ( [ n9 ] ) and ( [ n10 ] ) are independent of the coordinate @xmath34 , we can use the separation of variables method . as a result , ( [ n9 ] )",
    "yields        by way of example , we shall perform all further transformations using ( [ n9 ] ) for the voltage @xmath43 .",
    "serial expansion of @xmath43 with respect to the functions @xmath42 gives @xmath44 as a result , we have : @xmath45 where @xmath46 ,                in this case @xmath54 i.e. , @xmath55 for an ordinary coaxial waveguide , @xmath56 const , and so if the waveguide is contracted ( or expanded ) , then @xmath14 drops ( increases ) , whereas @xmath15 increases ( drops ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the second term in ( [ n20 ] ) becomes negative , and the situation occurs when @xmath57 becomes imaginary , the oscillations at the frequency @xmath58 vanish , and one of the exponents in ( [ n17 ] ) starts rising .",
    "a similar situation emerges for the current in the waveguide . with reducing longitudinal dimensions of the coaxial resonator , the frequency @xmath59 builds up due to increasing wavenumber @xmath41 . as a result",
    ", the change in geometrical dimensions of a coaxial resonator leads to a significant change in the radiation loss in the system .",
    "here we discussed a coaxial resonator ( waveguide ) .",
    "as is known , to describe different types of resonators in a stationary case , we can introduce inductances and capacitances . in a nonstationary case , we can introduce time - dependent @xmath60 and @xmath61 and derive equations similar to those obtained in this paper .",
