    "the afterglow of  was one of the brightest observed to date .",
    "shortly after the coordinates of the @xmath0-ray error box were made known , a previously uncataloged radio source was discovered near its center .",
    "based on the source location , its inverted spectrum and compactness , it was a strong candidate for being the radio counterpart of  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was confirmed by the subsequent discovery of an optical transient at the same location as the radio source ( @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up optical observations taken from 2 to 7 days after the burst showed that the spectral and temporal characteristics of this burst could be represented by power - law indices @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where f@xmath10 ( @xcite ) . with added data ,",
    "castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 2001 ) determined @xmath11 , and a somewhat steeper @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray properties , the localization and the subsequent afterglow discovery for  are presented in more detail by hurley et al .",
    ".    was also very bright at millimeter wavelengths ( @xcite ) and as a consequence , well - sampled spectra and light curves covering frequencies between 1.43 to 240 ghz were taken during the initial two weeks following the burst ( @xcite ; paper i ) .",
    "these observations made it possible , for the first time , to trace the time - evolution of the synchrotron spectrum directly without resorting to specific models for the evolution of the characteristic frequencies and the peak flux density . in comparing these results with model predictions",
    "it was found that spherically symmetric explosions in homogeneous or wind - blown circumburst media could be ruled out . a model in which the relativistic outflow is collimated ( _ i.e. , _ a jet )",
    "was shown to account for the observed evolution of the synchrotron parameters , the rapid decay at optical wavelengths , and the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions , provided that the jet transition has not been fully completed in the first two weeks after the event .",
    "this high quality dataset stimulated other modeling efforts for .",
    "li and chevalier ( 2001 ) argued that an isotropic explosion in a wind - blown ambient medium described the data equally well .",
    "however , in order to account for the fast decay of the optical light curves with respect to the radio light curves , they invoked a non - standard break in the electron energy distribution .",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) also required a broken power - law and they concluded that the best fit to the data was obtained for a jet - like outflow with an opening angle of about 15@xmath13 expanding into either a constant density or wind - blown circumburst medium .",
    "dai & gou ( 2001 ) present a variation on these other efforts , arguing that the steep optical decay is due to an anisotropic jet viewed off axis , which is expanding into a wind from a red supergiant .    in view of the disparate conclusions reached on the basis of this early afterglow data ,",
    "there is some hope that with further monitoring of the afterglow it may be possible to distinguish between these models .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we present radio observations of  made with the vla and the very large baseline array ( vlba ) which began at the end of the two week period covered in paper i and continued until the burst faded below our detection limits .",
    "we focus on the interpretation of the observations in terms of the predictions made by relativistic blast wave models .",
    "the observations and results are presented in  [ sec : rea ] and  [ sec : results ] and are discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "observations at 1.43 , 4.86 and 8.46 ghz were made using the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "all observations were performed in the default continuum mode in which , at each frequency , the full 100 mhz bandwidth was used in two adjacent 50-mhz bands .",
    "the synthesized beam at 8.46 ghz was approximately 0.8 .",
    "the beam size at other frequencies scales inversely with frequency .",
    "gain calibration was carried out by observing 3c .",
    "the array phase was monitored by switching between the grb and the phase calibrators j1637 + 462 ( at 8.46 ghz ) , j1658 + 476 ( at 4.86 ghz ) and j1653 + 397 ( at 1.43 ghz ) .",
    "data calibration and imaging were carried out with the _ aips _ software package following standard practice .",
    "we performed phase self - calibration on the 1.43 ghz data .",
    "flux densities were determined by a least squares fitting of the gaussian - shaped synthesized beam to the source . for very faint detection levels ( @xmath14 ) we used the peak flux density at the position of the radio counterpart ( @xcite ) .",
    "a log of the observations is provided in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "observations centered at 8.35 and 4.85 ghz were made using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) at four epochs . at both frequencies the observations consisted of eight channels of bandwidth 8 mhz ( 64 mhz total bandwidth ) spaced equally over a @xmath15 0.5 ghz frequency span .",
    "the phases were calibrated using the calibrator source 1637 + 472 . at each epoch",
    "the observations lasted @xmath15 9 hours ( divided over the source , calibrators and frequency switches ) .",
    "these observations were designed for an interstellar scintillation experiment ( requiring substantial time and frequency span ) , the results of which will be presented in a separate paper . here , in table [ tab : vlbaobs ] ,",
    "we report just the time - averaged flux densities .",
    "multiwavelength light curves of the event are presented in figure [ fig : obs ] .",
    "data are from this work ( tables [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : vlbaobs ] ) and paper i. optical observations are taken from castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , were we have only included early data ( less than 10 days after the event ) to measure the ` pure ' afterglow emission ( _ i.e. , _ where the underlying host does not contribute significantly ) .",
    "the vlba measurements may suffer from amplitude losses as a result of imperfect phase referencing .",
    "the lightcurves indicate that such losses may be significant since at 8.46 ghz the vlba data seem to be systematically lower than the vla data .",
    "the 8.46 and 4.86 ghz light curves rise to a maximum around 10 days . while the 8.46 ghz light curve is smoothly rising to a maximum of about 2 mjy during the first week",
    ", it undergoes a sudden drop to about 1 mjy ( around 9 days after the burst ) followed by a second peak ( around 12 days ) .",
    "such erratic flux density variations are the hallmark of interstellar scintillation ( iss ) .",
    "we will return to this point in  [ sec : iss ] .",
    "the overall trend in figure [ fig : obs ] is for the peak flux density to decline with decreasing frequency .",
    "a linear least squares fit was carried out to the late time radio light curve ( @xmath16=53 - 293 days ) at 8.46 ghz , and we derived a temporal decay index @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , where f@xmath19 ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the much steeper optical decay @xmath20 determined at @xmath16=2 - 10 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "reconciling this difference between the optical and radio decay indices is one of the main challenges in modeling the afterglow of  ( see  [ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "the lines - of - sight towards most grbs traverse a considerable pathlength through the turbulent ionized gas of our galaxy . as a result , the radio emission from grb afterglows is expected to be affected by interstellar scattering ( iss ) . indeed ,",
    "as predicted by goodman ( 1997 ) , iss has been positively identified in several cases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the subject of iss is a large one ( see review by rickett 1990 ) , and encompasses a range of observational phenomenology . here we concern ourselves with estimating the importance of iss - induced modulation of our flux density measurements as a function of time and frequency . for more detailed treatments of iss",
    "see goodman ( 1997 ) and walker ( 1998 ) .",
    "the character of the expected flux density fluctuations depend on whether the scattering takes place in the `` strong '' or `` weak '' regimes .",
    "we define a transition frequency @xmath21 below which the density irregularities can induce strong phase variations and above it there is only weak scattering ( wiss ) . strong scattering can result in both slow , broad - band changes , due to refractive interstellar scintillation ( riss ) , and fast , narrow - band variations due to diffractive interstellar scintillation ( diss ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 along any given line - of - sight depends on the strength of the scattering and the total pathlength .",
    "the amount of scattering is parameterized by the scattering measure , sm , as modeled for the galaxy by taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) . for convenience",
    "we assume that the scattering along the line - of - sight takes place in a thin screen located at @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 kpc ) is the exponential scale height of the ionized gas layer ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio afterglow emission will be modulated by iss provided that the source size @xmath25 is close to one of the three characteristic angular scales ( 1 ) @xmath26 , ( 2 ) @xmath27 , and ( 3 ) @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the angle subtended by the first fresnel zone at the scattering screen for @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 . the modulation index @xmath32 ( i.e. the r.m.s .",
    "fractional flux variation ) is given by :    @xmath33    the expansion of the afterglow may cause @xmath25 to eventually exceed one or more of the three characteristic angular scales that define the different scattering regimes . for ease of comparison in appendix [ sec : thetamodel ]",
    "we compute @xmath25 for three different interstellar medium ( ism ) models",
    "( a constant density ism model , a wind model [ wind ] and a jet model [ jet ] ; see  [ sec : syn ] ) . then the modulation will begin to `` quench '' as follows :    @xmath34    for grb991208 at ( @xmath35 = ( 724,+426 ) we estimate sm = 2.26@xmath36kpc m@xmath37 from the taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) model . taking a typical scattering screen distance of @xmath38 = 0.74 kpc we compute @xmath21 = 4.8 ghz and @xmath39 @xmath40as ( walker 1998 ) . the difficulties in obtaining accurate estimates of sm and @xmath38 likely limit the accuracy of the @xmath21 and @xmath29 values to @xmath41 30% . in figure",
    "[ fig : iss ] we plot these values along with lines showing the different iss regimes . on the right hand side of the figure",
    "we compute a model - dependent timescale for the fireball to reach the angular size given on the left hand side .",
    "we have assumed that the emission from grb991208 originates from a jet - like outflow for @xmath42 days and used the relevant expression for @xmath25 in appendix [ sec : thetamodel ] . at a redshift @xmath43 ( @xcite )",
    "the angular distance @xmath44=0.45@xmath45 cm , where @xmath46 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the source size is @xmath47 @xmath40as , where @xmath48 is the energy in the blast wave in units of 10@xmath49 erg and @xmath50 is the density of the ambient medium in particles @xmath51 .",
    "thus the observations in tables [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : vlbaobs ] ( and indicated as small crosses in figure [ fig : iss ] ) lie on either side of @xmath21 and were taken during a time when @xmath25 expanded to eventually exceed @xmath29 .",
    "it is apparent in figure [ fig : iss ] that most of the observations were taken in the weak scattering regime ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath53 ghz , @xmath54 and therefore we expect that the observed variations will be dominated by source evolution and measurement error , not iss .",
    "iss starts to become comparable to the measurement error at 15 ghz where it is straightforward to show that @xmath55 ( for @xmath56 ) .",
    "accounting for iss is particularly important at 8.46 ghz since the measurement error at this frequency is small ( @xmath57 5% ) while we expect @xmath58 = 0.45 for @xmath59 and for @xmath60 days @xmath61 .",
    "since the 8.46 ghz light curve is so well sampled , we can independently check on this prediction by subtracting out any linear trend and computing the scatter . for different assumed curves we find within the first two weeks of observations an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 20 - 30% , suggesting that the strength of scattering along this line - of - sight may be slightly weaker than we have predicted .",
    "we also expect large variations in the flux density at @xmath62 = 4.86 ghz but these are difficult to quantify , owning to the proximity of @xmath21 ( walker 1998 ) . for the purposes of model fitting we adopt @xmath63 and for @xmath64 days @xmath65 .",
    "the line @xmath66 indicates the transition diameter that separates the region where the modulations are riss dominated ( above @xmath67 ) from that were they are diss dominated ( below @xmath67 ) .",
    "the observations at @xmath62 = 1.43 ghz are clearly in the strong regime ( @xmath68 ) where @xmath69 , and where riss is expected to be significant with @xmath32 = 0.5 on refractive timescales of a day or more .",
    "shorter timescale ( @xmath703 hrs ) variations due to diss are also expected but at a reduced level of 10 - 15% , suppressed by the finite source size ( i.e. @xmath71 ) and bandwidth averaging .",
    "diss , unlike wiss and riss , is a _ narrow - band _ phenomenon with a decorrelation bandwidth @xmath72 mhz , the bandwidth of our observations .",
    "the radio / mm / optical to x - ray afterglow emission is believed to arise from the forward shock of a relativistic blast wave that propagates into the circumburst medium ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the electrons are assumed to be accelerated to a power - law distribution in energy , d@xmath73d@xmath74 , for @xmath75 , and radiate synchrotron emission ; where @xmath76 is the lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath77 is the minimum lorentz factor , and @xmath78 the power - law index of the electron energy distribution .",
    "detailed calculations by granot , piran and sari ( 2000a , b ) and granot and sari ( 2002 ) have shown that to good approximation ( to within a few percent ) the synchrotron afterglow spectrum can be described by the following function    @xmath79\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\rm a}}\\right)^{5/3}\\,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times &   \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\rm m}}\\right)^{n/3 } +   \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{\\rm m}}\\right)^{-(p-1)n/2}\\right]^{1/n}\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath80 is the synchrotron peak flux density at the peak frequency @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the synchrotron self - absorption frequency",
    ". the index @xmath83 ( @xcite ) and controls the sharpness of the peak at @xmath81 .",
    "we have assumed slow cooling , i.e. @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the synchrotron - cooling frequency .",
    "castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have measured a steeper optical slope @xmath86 than sagar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and have argued that this is evidence that the afterglow observations of  require the synchrotron cooling break to be located between radio and optical wavelengths .",
    "we model a possible synchrotron cooling break by a sharp spectral break with decrement @xmath87 = 0.5 at @xmath88 , and parameterization @xmath89 .",
    "the evolution of the break frequencies @xmath82 and @xmath90 , @xmath85 and the peak flux density @xmath80 follows from assumptions on the dynamics of the relativistic blast wave .",
    "it is common practice to assume three cases : i ) propagation into a constant density ambient medium ( ism ; sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) , ii ) propagation into a wind - stratified ambient medium ( wind ; chevalier and li 1999 , 2000 ) , and iii ) a blast - wave that is collimated in a jet ( jet ; sari , piran and halpern 1999 ; note that the evolution in the case of a jet is rather insensitive to the density structure of the ambient medium ; for details see kumar and panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "the three cases have in common that the synchrotron parameters all evolve as power laws in time ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) but differ in the values of their decay indices and coefficients .",
    "in addition to assuming model - dependent decay indices , in this paper and in paper i we solved for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 explicitly by model fitting the above synchrotron spectrum ( free ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it assumes only that the afterglow is due to synchrotron emission with a power - law distribution of electron energies , and it imposes no physical constraints on the geometry of the outflow , the microphysics of the shock or the density structure of the circumburst medium .",
    "we fit the function @xmath99 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : func ] to the observations presented in paper i , this work ( tables [ tab : obs ] and [ tab : vlbaobs ] ) and the early time optical data of castro - tirado et al .",
    "we minimize the @xmath100 of the fit by the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization scheme .",
    "we account for the effect of interstellar scintillation by adding in quadrature the predicted scatter due to iss ( see previous discussion ) to the measurement error .",
    "we determine the 68.3 % ( 1@xmath101 ) uncertainties in the parameters by plotting contours in chisquared where @xmath100 is raised by 2.3 as a function of the two relevant parameters and by leaving the remaining parameters free .",
    "the result of the best fits are shown in figure [ fig : obs ] and presented in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "in addition to this free - form model ( free ) , we also fixed the decay - rate parameters ( @xmath102 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 ) at the predicted values for the constant density ism , the wind and the jet model and repeated the fit .",
    "the results of the jet fit are shown in figure [ fig : obsj ] and presented in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "as expected from the earlier attempts in paper i , the standard wind and constant density ism fits were rejected as unsuitable ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "these fits do not account well for the combination of the rapid decay at optical wavelengths and the more shallow decay at radio wavelengths .",
    "the principal challenge in modeling the afterglow of  is in simultaneously fitting for the decay of the radio ( @xmath104 ) and optical ( @xmath20 ) light curves .",
    "the model that best represents the data is the free - form model ( free ) in which all the parameters in eqn .",
    "[ eq : func ] were solved for . the free model shown in figure [ fig : obs ] and",
    "summarized in table [ tab : fit ] differs from the original model presented in paper i in several respects .",
    "most notably , with the addition of the optical data from castro - tirado et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , it has been necessary to allow for a cooling break between the optical and millimeter bands (  [ sec : syn ] ) .",
    "this has the effect of flattening the value of @xmath78 which improves the fit to the decay of the optical light curve .",
    "a cooling break in the spectrum also alters the temporal decline of the synchrotron parameters but the values in table [ tab : fit ] agree , within the errors , to those derived in paper i. the free model resolves the differences between @xmath105 and @xmath106 by allowing for a relatively shallow decay of the peak flux density , _",
    "i.e. _ f@xmath107 , and an unusually rapid evolution of the cooling frequency to lower frequencies , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath108 .",
    "this is generally much faster than any model yet proposed for grb afterglows . for @xmath109",
    "this implies @xmath110=constant ( where @xmath111 is the bulk lorentz factor of the flow , and @xmath112 is the post - shock magnetic field ) . for any reasonable model",
    "both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are _ decreasing _ with time unless either the circumburst density or the fraction of shock energy in the b - field @xmath113 are increasing in time . in a future paper ( s. yost , _ in preparation _ ) we plan to explore such modifications to the standard model for a number of well - studied afterglows .",
    "both li and chevalier ( 2001 ) and panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) suggested a revision to the basic afterglow model in order to overcome the difficulties with jointly fitting the radio and optical data for this burst .",
    "they proposed the existence of a two - component electron energy distribution with different slopes above and below some break frequency @xmath114 .",
    "reasonable fits were obtained for either wind and jet models provided that the radio ( optical ) emission was dominated by the low ( high ) energy electrons .",
    "li & chevalier ( 2001 ) also made predictions for the future evolution of the afterglow beyond the first two weeks , allowing further tests of their model .",
    "the measured @xmath115 for the 8.46 ghz light curve is in good agreement with their predicted decay @xmath116 .",
    "the largest source of disagreement is in the low frequency behavior . in their wind model",
    "the peak flux density at 1.43 ghz is predicted to be a factor of 10 times larger than what is measured .",
    "this is likely due to the relatively slow evolution of @xmath82 where @xmath117 , a value that is closer to the jet model ( @xmath118 ) than the wind model ( @xmath119 ) .    in paper i",
    "when the spectral fits were compared with the expectations for specific models , satisfactory agreement was found for the jet model . nevertheless , there were a number of discrepancies , notably the decline in the peak flux density f@xmath120 was too shallow , and the value for the slope of the electron energy distribution @xmath121 was steeper than that implied by the decay of the optical light curves @xmath122 .",
    "it was proposed that these problems with the jet model could be reconciled if the jet was in transition to its fully asymptotic behavior . in our new jet model",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : obsj ] and table [ tab : fit ] ) the addition of a cooling break improves the overall quality of the fit considerably . despite this agreement",
    ", there is a suggestion in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsj ] that the jet model is having some difficulties with the late time radio measurements .",
    "most of the excess @xmath100 in the jet model results from the fact that the late - time light curve ( @xmath123100 days ) at 8.46 ghz is flat , @xmath115 , whereas the jet model predicts that the flux density will fall as f@xmath124 , in agreement with @xmath125 .",
    "there are two additional effects , not accounted for in our analysis , that could make @xmath126 . in the first instance ,  could have occurred in a radio - bright host galaxy ( _ e.g. _ , berger , kulkarni & frail 2001 ) .",
    "sokolov et al .  ( 2001 ) have used various optical methods to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) for the host galaxy of   and derive an extinction - corrected sfr@xmath127 m@xmath128 yr@xmath129 .",
    "although there are large uncertainties in such estimates , at @xmath130 such elevated sfr s should be detectable at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "assuming a standard starburst spectral energy distribution ( @xcite ) we predict @xmath131 @xmath40jy , significantly brighter than our measurements .",
    "we can therefore infer that the sfr in the host of  is probably no higher than a few tens of m@xmath128 yr@xmath129 .",
    "deeper radio observations taken a year or more after the burst , when the emission from the afterglow is negligible , are needed to provide a more accurate estimate of the star formation rate .",
    "another possible source of the flattening of the radio light curves could be the transition of the relativistic blast wave to non - relativistic expansion .",
    "frail , waxman , & kulkarni ( 2000 ) modeled the decay of the radio light curves for grb970508 at @xmath132 100 days as a non - relativistic expansion .",
    "the expected decay rate in this phase of the evolution is @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "thus , it is possible that the difference in decay rates is due to a transition to non - relativisitic expansion at @xmath135 days .",
    "more sophisticated modeling is needed which explicitly includes the evolving dynamics of the blastwave ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) in order to test this hypothesis .    in summary , with continued monitoring of the bright afterglow of , it has been possible to track the evolution of its radio light curve out to nearly 300 days after the burst .",
    "the power - law decline of the optical light curve at early times is considerably steeper than the radio light curve at late times .",
    "there are several different explanations for reconciling this disparate behavior , including modifying the standard relativistic model with non - standard electron distributions , and with circumburst densities or equipartition parameters @xmath113 that increase with time .",
    "however , the simplest explanation which is consistent with the data and requires no significant modifications , is that the blastwave of  entered a non - relativistic expansion phase several months after the burst .",
