    "in a search to unravel the fabric of space at short distances , many authors have explored variations on ordinary quantum mechanics based on @xmath0-deformations of the canonical commutation relation , @xmath0 being a parameter in the interval @xmath1 where 1 corresponds to the bose limit , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite time quantization was considered also , see @xcite , @xcite . on an entirely different line of research , probabilists developed the notion of stochastic time changes ( also called stochastic subordination ) as a way of understanding jump processes , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this work gave rise to a representation of levy processes , a family of translation invariant jump processes , as subordinated brownian motions whereby the time change is uncorrelated to the underlying process .",
    "more generally , monroe proved that all semi - martingales can be represented as time - changed brownian motions , as long as one allows for the subordinator to be correlated .    in this paper",
    "we bring together ideas from all these lines of research and show that one can interpret @xmath0-deformations in terms of stochastic time changes , albeit of a new type which is designed in such a way to preserve quantum probability .",
    "we find that these representations provide new insights in the notion of @xmath0-deformation and indicate an alternative , physically intuitive path to understand short - scale deformations of quantum field theory .",
    "stochastic subordination is a procedure to construct a stochastic process from another by means of a stochastic time change .",
    "if @xmath2 is a stochastic process , the subordinated process @xmath3 is defined as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a monotonously non decreasing process .",
    "the process @xmath5 is called bochner subordinator in case its increments @xmath6 are independent and their distribution depends only on the time elapsed @xmath7 but not on @xmath8 .",
    "such time - homogeneity property makes bochner subordinator potentially appealing also for basic quantum physics . under such hypothesis ,",
    "if the process @xmath2 is stationary and markov and @xmath9 is its generator , then also the process @xmath3 is a stationary markov process .",
    "one can show under mild conditions that the generator @xmath10 of @xmath3 can be expressed as a function @xmath11 .",
    "it is useful to sketch a quick proof in order to work out a quantum extension .",
    "suppose that the generator @xmath9 admits a complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath12 with eigenvalues @xmath13 .",
    "( the argument below can readily be extended to the case where @xmath9 has also continuous spectrum ) .",
    "we have that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fixed initial condition .",
    "if one instead evolves the initial state according to the @xmath3 dynamics the distribution @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 f_n(x).\\ ] ] hence , there ought to be a function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 an equation that needs to hold true for all times @xmath8 and all values of @xmath20 .",
    "this equation constrains the form of the functions @xmath18 as not all functions admit a one - parameter family of positive measures @xmath21 such as the equation above is satisfied .",
    "the measures @xmath21 , if well - defined , are called the renewal measures @xcite .    notice",
    "that bochner subordination also applies to general positivity preserving contraction semigroups @xmath22 , as the subordinated semigroup @xmath23 can be consistently defined as follows : @xmath24    in the quantum mechanics case the problem is different as conservation of quantum probability requires that the dynamics be defined by one - parameter groups of unitary transformations .",
    "if @xmath25 is a quantum hamiltonian and @xmath26 is the corresponding dynamics , the subordinated dynamics is defined as follows : @xmath27 consistency with quantum probability conservation requires that @xmath28 be a complex valued measure such that @xmath29 for some real valued function @xmath18 .",
    "this condition restricts the form of the measures @xmath28 . as extensions to the renewal measures , we shall call @xmath28 the _ quantum renewal measures . _    in the following we consider several examples using two versions of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator as example .",
    "a first example is provided by the one - mode harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath30 where the creation and annihilation operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfy the following relations @xmath33 this deformation scheme was proposed by arik and coon in @xcite and leads to the energy spectrum @xmath34 this means that the @xmath0-deformed hamiltonian operator @xmath35 can be represented so that @xmath36 in the euclidean picture , one considers the semigroup @xmath37 , which can be represented as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 notice that @xmath21 is the distribution at time @xmath8 of a poisson process of characteristic time @xmath40 .    in the real - time , quantum picture",
    ", we have to account for phases required to maintain quantum probability conservation , namely @xmath41 where the quantum renewal measure characterizing the quantum subordinator is given by @xmath42 by re - using the terminology in @xcite , the location of the poles of the quantum renewal measure will be referred to as `` chronons '' , or time quanta .    in summary",
    ", these expressions show that the arik - coon @xmath0-deformation scheme for the harmonic oscillator is equivalent in the euclidean picture to a time quantization , whereby imaginary time proceeds according to a poisson process and has increments equal to discrete quanta of @xmath43 . in the real , quantum - mechanics time picture , a similar poisson distribution applies except that additional phases have to be added to the expansion in such a way to ensure conservation of quantum probability . in the latter representation , chronons are located at equally spaced intervals along the imaginary axis .",
    "alternative deformation rules have been proposed by biedenharn in @xcite and macfarlane in @xcite . according to this scheme",
    "@xmath0 is a parameter which can be not only real , but can also take values in the unit circle @xmath44 . according to this scheme the creation and annihilation operators @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 satisfy the following relations @xmath45 and the energy spectrum is @xmath46 in the following , we shall indeed assume that @xmath47 , so that the @xmath0-deformed hamiltonian operator @xmath35 is thus @xmath48    the function @xmath49 does not correspond to a bochner subordinator , as there is no one - parameter family of positive measures such that relation ( [ eq : bochnerbernstein ] ) holds .",
    "hence in the euclidean picture , one can not consistently construct a positivity preserving semigroup . in real - time however , there is not such a restriction on the measure and we find @xmath50 where the measure characterizing the quantum subordinator is given by @xmath51    in this case , time is quantized along the real axis and the chronons , or quantized time values , are poles of the measure @xmath28 .",
    "the time quanta , or the chronon increment , is given by @xmath52 , as in the arik - coon @xmath0-deformation scheme .",
    "it is instructive to compare both @xmath0-deformation schemes and plot the distribution of the respective chronons .",
    "figure [ fig : quantization ] illustrates furthermore the contour in the lower half plane , used to integrate the measures @xmath28 in ( [ eq : ac_chi ] ) and ( [ eq : bm_chi ] ) .",

    "stochastic subordination is one of the most common methodologies to deform stochastic processes . in this paper",
    ", we introduce an analogue concept of quantum subordination that is appropriate to deform quantum mechanical systems .",
    "we show that this notion is broad enough to capture two examples that received much attention in the literature , namely two versions of the @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator . in these two case ,",
    "we show how quantum subordination is defined by means of a quantum renewal function , an analytic function with poles corresponding to time quanta or , to re - use the terminology in @xcite , chronons .",
    "these concepts provide a new angle to the notion of @xmath0-deformation and shed light on a physically intuitive route to model short - scale deformations of quantum field theory ."
