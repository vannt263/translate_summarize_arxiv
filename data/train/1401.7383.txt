    "a knot is a closed curve in @xmath6-space @xmath7 .",
    "knots appear in many physical systems in the natural sciences , for example , in molecular chains such as dna and proteins , and they have been considered to be useful models for structural analysis of these molecules . a knot can be embedded in many different ways in @xmath6-space , smooth or piecewise linear . by a _ polygonal knot _ we will mean a knot which consists of finite line segments , called _ sticks _ , glued end - to - end .",
    "this representation of knots is very useful for many applications because microscopic level molecules are more similar to rigid sticks than flexible ropes .",
    "define the _ stick number _ @xmath8 of a topological knot type @xmath1 as the minimal number of sticks required to realize @xmath1 as a polygonal knot .",
    "randell @xcite first showed that a nontrivial polygonal knot needs at least six sticks and @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , all five and six crossing prime knots @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the square and granny knots and two eight crossing knots @xmath16 and @xmath17 are only known knots having stick number 8 .",
    "several upper and lower bounds on the stick number for various classes of knots were founded .",
    "negami @xcite used graph theory to provide upper and lower bounds for the stick number in terms of the crossing number @xmath2 , @xmath18 . later",
    "huh and oh @xcite improved negami s upper bound to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore @xmath20 for a non - alternating prime knot @xmath1 .",
    "also calvo @xcite improved this lower bound to @xmath21 . for the stick number of a composite knot , adams , brennan , greilsheimer and woo @xcite and jin @xcite independently proved that @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in another quantity concerning polygonal knots .",
    "equilateral knot _ is a polygonal knot which consists of equal length sticks .",
    "equilateral stick number _ @xmath0 of a knot @xmath1 is defined to be the minimal number of equal length sticks required to construct a equilateral knot representation of @xmath1 .",
    "little is known about the equilateral stick number .",
    "adams et al .",
    "@xcite proved that @xmath23 .",
    "also rawdon and scharein @xcite used algorithms in the software knotplot to compute upper bounds for the equilateral stick numbers of all prime knots through 10 crossings .",
    "they showed that all such knots except seven knots can be constructed by the same number of equal length sticks as their stick numbers .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows projections of the trefoil and the figure - eight knots constructed by minimal number of equal length sticks .     and",
    "@xmath24    in this paper we establish an upper bound on the equilateral stick number of nontrivial knots in terms of the minimal crossing number .",
    "furthermore we find another upper bound on the equilateral stick number of composite knots .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath1 be a nontrivial knot",
    ". then @xmath3 .",
    "moreover if @xmath1 is a non - alternating prime knot , then @xmath4 .",
    "[ thm2 ] let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be nontrivial knots",
    ". then @xmath5 .",
    "moreover if one of knot is non - alternating prime , then @xmath27 , and if both knots are non - alternating prime , then @xmath28 .",
    "remark that the equilateral stick number of a knot with at most 10 crossings is very close to its stick number as the result in @xcite .",
    "thus the reader may curious about that we probably reduce the upper bound of the equilateral stick number to @xmath29 for some positive number @xmath30 by using the similar method in @xcite .",
    "but there is an obstacle to extending this method to constructing an equilateral realization . in @xcite ,",
    "vertical line segments vary in length , so if we adjust them in a uniform length , then unexpected crossing changes might happen .",
    "in this section we introduce another minimality invariant , an _ arc index_. there is an open - book decomposition of @xmath7 which has open half - planes as pages and the standard @xmath31-axis as the binding axis .",
    "we may regard each page as a half - plane @xmath32 at angle @xmath33 when the @xmath34-plane has a polar coordinate .",
    "it can be easily shown that every knot @xmath1 can be embedded in an open - book decomposition with finitely many pages so that it meets each page in a simple arc .",
    "such an embedding is called an _ arc presentation _ of @xmath1 . the _ arc index _",
    "@xmath35 is defined to be the minimal number of pages among all possible arc presentations of @xmath1 .",
    "the left of figure [ fig2 ] shows an arc presentation of the trefoil knot .",
    "here the points of @xmath1 on the binding axis are called binding indices , assigned by @xmath36 from bottom to top .",
    "we mention two rotating operations on arc presentations of knots . like turning pages of a book",
    "we can rotate the pages along the binding axis of an arc presentation .",
    "this changing is called _",
    "page rotating_. similarly we can also rotate binding indices so that for some fixed integer @xmath30 each binding index @xmath37 goes to @xmath38 where if @xmath39 , then we use @xmath40 instead of @xmath38 .",
    "this is call _ binding index rotating_. clearly both rotations do not change the knot type of @xmath1 .",
    "bae and park established an upper bound on the arc index in terms of the crossing number .",
    "corollary @xmath41 and theorem @xmath42 in @xcite provide that @xmath43 , and moreover @xmath44 if @xmath1 is a non - alternating prime knot .",
    "later jin and park improved the second part of bae and park s theorem .",
    "theorem @xmath45 in @xcite provides that if @xmath1 is a non - alternating prime knot , then @xmath46 .",
    "thus we have the following ;    [ thm : ac ] let @xmath1 be any nontrivial knot",
    ". then @xmath43 .",
    "moreover if @xmath1 is a non - alternating prime knot , then @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm1 ] . let @xmath1 be a nontrivial knot with @xmath47 and @xmath48 be an arc presentation of @xmath1 .",
    "now we modify @xmath48 so that consecutive binding indices are close enough and each arc consists of two adjacent equilateral sticks on the related page .",
    "we may assume that the distance between any two consecutive binding indices is @xmath49 for convenience and all sticks have length 1 as the right in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "already we obtain a equilateral knot of @xmath1 consisting of @xmath50 equal length sticks .",
    "now we will reduce two more sticks from @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the two sticks adjacent to the binding index 1 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 be the other two sticks adjacent to @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . as in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , delete two sticks @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "rotate the stick @xmath53 clockwise along its endpoint at the binding axis on the related page until @xmath53 is close enough to the binding axis .",
    "now rotate the other stick @xmath54 clockwise along its endpoint at the binding axis on the related page so that the distance between the other endpoints of @xmath53 and @xmath54 which are not at the binding axis is 1 .",
    "glue a new stick @xmath55 with length 1 to these endpoints .",
    "clearly this formation does not change the knot type , but we reduce one stick from the original .",
    "note that there is no arc connecting the first and the last binding indices .",
    "otherwise , after some binding index rotating , this arc connects consecutive two binding indices .",
    "this means that we can reduce the arc index , a contradiction .",
    "thus we can repeat the above argument via the two sticks @xmath56 and @xmath57 adjacent to the binding index @xmath30 and the other two sticks @xmath58 and @xmath59 adjacent to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , because these four sticks are different from the previous four sticks .",
    "thus we reduce one more stick again .        in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ thm2 ] .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be nontrivial knots and @xmath61 and @xmath62 be their minimal arc presentations . since nontrivial knots have at least 5 arcs in their arc presentations , we can choose arcs @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , whose endpoints are not the first or the last binding indices of these arc presentations . by using page rotating , we move all the arcs , except @xmath63 , of @xmath61 and only @xmath64 of @xmath62 to the opposite sides as in figure [ fig4 ]",
    ". then , delete two arcs @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and connect the two arcs of @xmath61 to the two arcs of @xmath62 , yielding a representation of @xmath65 .",
    "note that the binding indices of @xmath61 except the connection points must be apart from the binding indices of @xmath62 .",
    "now we can apply the same arguments as in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] independently to the arc presentations on both sides of the binding axis .",
    "thus we can reduce two sticks on both sides .",
