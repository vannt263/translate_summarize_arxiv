    "quite recently , it has become popular to study fluid motions in a _",
    "coordinate system @xmath3 , i.e. , a curvilinear , possibly rotating frame in euclidean space which is defined such as to move with the fluid . since the lagrangian description has a number of advantages over the eulerian one , and since this description enjoys many applications in the recent cosmology literature , it is important to elucidate in proper language the lagrangian formalism . since the lectures by franois bouchet and peter coles ( this volume ) explore the field of recent applications of the lagrangian perturbation theory ,",
    "i here concentrate on the basic architecture of a lagrangian theory of structure formation .",
    "i do this in newtonian cosmology , the lecture by sabino matarrese ( this volume ) gives an extension to the framework of general relativity .",
    "accordingly , i kept my reference list short , since more references may be found in the other lectures .    that the lagrangian approach is experiencing a revival in cosmology is good news",
    "; i consider it the natural frame to describe fluid motions , since this description is formally close to the mechanics of point particles .",
    "if you consult old textbooks on hydrodynamics , you will find that the lagrangian picture was considered too complicated for practical purposes beyond problems with high symmetry , and therefore has not been pursued further .",
    "i hope that , after this and the related lectures , you will be convinced of the opposite .",
    "let us start with the basic system of equations in newtonian cosmology describing the motion of a pressureless fluid in the gravitational field which is generated by its own density .",
    "we think at applications for a ( dominating ) collisionless component in the universe ; the gravitational dynamics we describe is thought to act as an attractor for the baryonic matter component which is `` lighted up '' by physics not described by these equations .    with this assumption the fluid motion in eulerian space is completely characterized by its velocity field @xmath4 and its density field @xmath5 .",
    "the fluid has to obey the familiar _ evolution equations _ for these fields , @xmath6 where the gravitational field @xmath7 is constrained by the ( newtonian ) _ field equations _",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 denotes the cosmological constant .",
    "( strictly speaking , @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 1a ) is a force per unit _ inertial mass _ , whereas in eqs .",
    "( 1c , d ) @xmath10 is the field strength associated with _",
    "gravitational mass_. that we set both equal is the content of einstein s equivalence principle of inertial and gravitational mass . )",
    "alternatively , we can write the eqs .",
    "( 1c ) and ( 1d ) in terms of a single poisson equation for the gravitational potential , which we do not need in the following .",
    "hereafter , we call the system ( 1 ) the _ euler  newton system_.    one important issue to learn about the lagrangian treatment is the fact that both evolution equations ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) can be integrated exactly in lagrangian space , velocity and density will therefore not appear as dynamical variables later . to see this , we first look at the basic lagrangian field variable which is the _ trajectory field _ of fluid elements , or the _ deformation field _ of the medium , respectively ( fig.1a ) : @xmath11 where @xmath3 denote the lagrangian coordinates which label fluid elements , @xmath2 are the positions of these elements in eulerian space at the time @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the trajectory of fluid elements for constant @xmath3 .",
    "( notice : the eulerian positions @xmath2 are here viewed not as independent variables ( i.e. , coordinates ) , but as dependent fields of lagrangian coordinates ; therefore , we employ the letter @xmath13 for the sake of clarity .",
    "independent variables are now @xmath14 instead of @xmath15 . )",
    "-7.1 true cm    the velocity field @xmath4 of the fluid is the tangential field to this family of curves , @xmath16 and the dot denotes the total ( lagrangian or convective ) time  derivative along @xmath17 : @xmath18 ( the dot commutes with lagrangian differentiation . )    in view of ( 2c ) we recognize that the eulerian evolution equation ( 1a ) can be written as @xmath19 , which is the familiar definition of acceleration ( here , the acceleration of a fluid element along its trajectory ) .",
    "consequently , in view of ( 2b ) , we know the acceleration field in lagrangian space for _ any given _ trajectory : @xmath20 in other words , taking ( 2b ) and ( 2d ) as _ definitions _ of velocity and acceleration , respectively ( like in point mechanics ! ) , we see that equation ( 1a ) is automatically fulfilled as we switch to the lagrangian description .",
    "a similar logic applies to the continuity equation ( 1b ) : the deformation of the medium is described by the lagrangian _ deformation tensor _ ( @xmath21 ) , i.e. , the tensor of first derivatives of the trajectory field with respect to lagrangian coordinates which measures how much the eulerian positions deviate from their original ( lagrangian ) positions .",
    "the volume of the deformed fluid element is measured by the determinant of this tensor , @xmath22 , and therefore its density must be inversely proportional to it ( fig.1b ) : @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the initial density field , and @xmath25 according to our definition of the lagrangian coordinates in ( 2a ) which coincide with the eulerian ones at @xmath26 . ) you may verify ( 2e ) by differentiation and by using the identity @xmath27 again we conclude that , for _ any given _ @xmath28 , we obtain the exact expression for the density at the fluid element , i.e. , in lagrangian space .",
    "let us now move to the question which _ lagrangian evolution equations _ the field of trajectories has to obey .",
    "we obtain them by expressing the field equations ( 1c ) and ( 1d ) ( which are @xmath29 linear `` constraint equations '' for the acceleration field ) in terms of lagrangian coordinates which , as we shall see , yields @xmath29 non  linear partial differential equations for @xmath30 . for this purpose",
    "we need the inverse of the transformation ( 2a ) from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates , @xmath31 while the deformation tensor is the jacobian matrix of the transformation from eulerian to lagrangian coordinates , @xmath32 , the inverse of @xmath21 is the inverse jacobian matrix @xmath33 since the transformation part `` looks '' inconvenient during a first reading of papers on lagrangian models , i here try to be as elementary as possible .",
    "we look at the two  dimensional case first , i.e. , there are only two non  vanishing field components , e.g. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we then get for the eulerian derivatives of @xmath10 : @xmath36 inserting the inverse jacobian matrix , @xmath37 with @xmath38 , we can express the single component of the curl and the divergence of @xmath10 in terms of lagrangian derivatives of @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 using the exact integrals ( 2d ) and ( 2e ) of eqs .",
    "( 1a ) and ( 1b ) , eqs .",
    "( 1c ) and ( 1d ) are transformed into a closed newtonian system for the trajectories in 2d : @xmath42 ( notice that we have multiplied with @xmath43 , i.e. , we must ensure that @xmath44 . )",
    "looking at the equations ( 5 ) we see that we have just written out functional determinants : @xmath45 in 3d we have to employ some more tensor algebra , but the procedure is the same .",
    "the relevant formula for the transformation of any tensor ( here exemplified for the acceleration gradient ( @xmath46 ) ) reads : @xmath47 where we have used the formula for the inverse jacobian ( 2h ) . in view of the definition of a functional determinant of any three functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 e.g. , for the jacobian determinant we simply have @xmath52 ,",
    "we can write equation ( 6 ) as @xmath53 the curl and the divergence of the acceleration field can be read from eq .",
    "( 6 ) as the anti ",
    "symmetric part of the acceleration gradient and its trace ( here , repeated indices imply summation as before , but with @xmath54 running through the cyclic permutations of @xmath55 ) : @xmath56}=-{1\\over 2}(\\nabla \\times \\vec g)_k = { 1\\over 2 } \\epsilon_{pq \\lbrack j } { \\cal j}({\\ddot f}_{i \\rbrack},f_p , f_q ) j^{-1 } \\;\\;,&(7a , b , c)\\cr & g_{i , i}=(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec g ) = { 1 \\over 2}\\epsilon_{abc}\\;{\\cal j}({\\ddot f}_a , f_b , f_c ) j^{-1 } \\;\\;.&(7d)\\cr}\\ ] ] inserting ( 7 ) and the exact integrals ( 2d ) and ( 2e ) into ( 1c ) and ( 1d ) we finally obtain the _ lagrange  newton system _ @xmath57(no background source , in particular @xmath58 ) and @xmath59(including backgrounds of friedmann type ) : @xmath60 i have written this system here in explicit form to make working with these equations most convenient .",
    "( alternative forms of these equations may be found in @xmath61 ; in that paper we also employ the calculus of differential forms , which makes the above derivation even simpler . )",
    "the lagrange  newton system ( 8) is the basic system of equations we want to study .",
    "although these equations look , and in fact are more complicated than their eulerian counterparts , they have proven to be as useful for finding exact solutions as well as perturbative approximations beyond the linear regime . here , i note that the rules of determinant manipulations apply to these equations , and we may evaluate many problems analytically .",
    "let us summarize the main conclusions of this section :    @xmath62 the for the velocity and density fields ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) are integrated exactly in the lagrangian picture by ( 2d ) and ( 2e ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath62 the transformation of the ( 1c , d ) yields a system of for the acceleration field .",
    "@xmath62 using the integrals for the acceleration and density fields ( 2d ) and ( 2e ) we arrive at the ( 8) which is a closed system of for the . density and velocity are no longer dynamical variables , but are replaced by the dynamical field @xmath28 .",

    "note that the lagrange ",
    "newton system remains regular at caustics ( @xmath65 ) where the eulerian representation breaks down . whether the lagrangian equations still describe the physics correctly in the regime @xmath66",
    "will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "the question how to obtain the evolution of eulerian fields from the lagrangian description is easily answered : knowing the lagrangian solution of the transformation ( 2a ) , @xmath67 , we have to express the eulerian fields first in terms of @xmath13 , and then use the inverse of this transformation ( 2 g ) , @xmath68 , to map the variable @xmath3 back to eulerian space , e.g. , for the velocity we have : @xmath69 the power of a lagrangian description mainly relies on this implicit determination of the evolution of eulerian fields",
    ". however , we can only come back to eulerian space as long as @xmath70 exists .",
    "in general , the inverse transformation can be multivalued ( see the discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "the same rule applies to _ any _ eulerian field , so we only have to find the corresponding formula which expresses it in terms of @xmath13 .",
    "let us now discuss another way of describing the evolution of eulerian fields along trajectories .",
    "this will lead us to equations which are frequently discussed in the literature .",
    "these equations are useful to illuminate the power of the lagrangian formalism outlined in section 1 , but they do not determine the evolution of eulerian fields _ per se _ , as will be shown below .",
    "we may ask for evolution equations which involve the lagrangian time ",
    "derivative ( 2c ) instead of the eulerian time ",
    "derivative @xmath71 as in ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) .",
    "they may be written in symbolic form as : @xmath72 i.e. , a system of @xmath73 equations which determines the evolution of the @xmath73 variables @xmath74 along the flow lines .",
    "a solution of this system of equations does not provide the full answer , which needs knowledge of the trajectories themselves !",
    "we will see that the procedure outlined at the beginning of this subsection _ does provide _ the full answer .",
    "we shall derive now _",
    "lagrangian evolution equations _ for a number of fields of interest , and shall then reinforce the lagrange  newton system ( 8) .",

    "there have been efforts in the literature to close this system of _ ordinary _ differential equations by using the corresponding equations of general relativity ( compare @xmath100 and the lecture by matarrese ) and looking at their newtonian limits .",
    "( in fact , the eqs .",
    "( 13a  d ) are formally identical to their gr counterparts in `` comoving '' , i.e. , lagrangian coordinates . )",
    "however , it turns out that , although we can formally derive an evolution equation for the tidal tensor , the system of equations ( 13 ) supplemented by the evolution equation for the tidal tensor is not a system of _ ordinary _ differential equations and the problem remains `` non  local '' @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath61 .    as a matter of fact , in newtonian theory we do nt need evolution equations for tracefree symmetric tensors ( like the shear and tidal tensors ) to get a closed system of equations .",

    "the perturbation solutions discussed in the next section will provide examples .",
    "the previous sections have equipped us with the necessary framework in which the lagrangian dynamics of self  gravitating flows can be studied . we have reduced the description of the dynamics of any eulerian field to the problem of finding the field of trajectories @xmath13 as a solution of the lagrange  newton system ( 8) . this problem will be addressed now .      as in the eulerian case",
    "we are not able to write down a solution for generic initial data ( i.e. without any symmetry assumptions like plane or spherical symmetry ) .",

    "is that of a _ homogeneous deformation _ : @xmath112 we assume hereafter that it is isotropic , @xmath113 inserting this ansatz into the lagrange  newton system ( 8) yields the well  known equation @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the homogeneous density field calculated from ( 16a , c ) and ( 2e )",

    "the _ lagrangian perturbation approach _ then consists of solving the lagrange ",
    "newton system for powers of @xmath120 to obtain the @xmath121th order solution : @xmath122 note the following important differences to the eulerian perturbation approach : 1 .",
    "we need not perturb the density field as in the eulerian case ; 2 . the perturbed flow @xmath13 is expressed in terms of coordinates which are constant along this flow , while in the eulerian case the perturbation is expressed in a fixed frame , which does not change by moving away from the homogeneous flow .",
    "this implies that , although deviations @xmath117 from @xmath118 might be small compared to the homogeneous displacement , the eulerian fields evaluated along the perturbed flow can experience large changes ( fig.2 ) .",
    "-7.1 true cm    solutions of the form ( 17 ) can be found and in the following subsections we shall learn more about them .",
    "-1 true cm      in the ansatz ( 17 ) we have splitted the inhomogeneous model into a homogeneous  isotropic model and a deviation from it . before we discuss solutions of the form ( 17 ) we have to look at another assumption which has to be imposed on the inhomogeneous models .",
    "this will be necessary for their application to cosmology .",
    "in cosmology we want the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic deformation to describe the _ mean motion _ of the whole universe , and we want to interprete this motion as a reference frame ( associated with , e.g. , the microwave background ) .",
    "this interpretation requires that the background model ( which , so far , is a homogeneous solution ) correctly describes the _ average flow _ , i.e. , inhomogeneities or peculiar ",
    "motions must vanish on average on some large scale .",
    "this we call the _ cosmological principle of homogeneity_. that the average flow is isotropic is another assumption which we set _ a priori_. it is , however , supported by the extreme isotropy of the microwave background . therefore , in order to make lagrangian perturbation models applicable to reality , we have to carefully analyze the average of inhomogeneous models .",
    "for this purpose we may look at the general expansion law in newtonian cosmology by averaging the system of equations ( 13 ) .",
    "a general discussion is to be found in @xmath123 .",
    "this study shows that the general expansion law for an expansion function @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the volume of the spatial domain @xmath126 on which the average is performed , is of the form : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the total mass contained in @xmath126 .",
    "( 18a ) shows that the average expansion is of friedmann type , @xmath129 , only in the case where the averages of the nonlinear terms on the r.h.s .",
    "( which depend on the inhomogeneities ) vanish ( compare ( 16d ) ) .",
    "in other words , if we follow inhomogeneities into the nonlinear regime ( and that s what we have in mind with lagrangian approximations ) , then we actually neglect the influence of the inhomogeneities on the global expansion when we use homogeneous solutions for the average flow .",
    "since these nonlinear source terms can be written as a divergence @xmath123 , we can use gau s theorem to transform the volume integrals in ( 18a ) into surface integrals over the boundary of the domain @xmath130 , e.g. : @xmath131 the flux of @xmath132 and @xmath133 through the boundary of the averaging volume is assumed to be negligible .",
    "this can only be true , if the extent of structures in the universe is considerably smaller than the averaging domain .",
    "in standard cosmologies we assume that this is indeed the case on some large scale where we apply our models , and we even assume that this boundary flux is exactly zero .",
    "it is interesting to see at this stage that we implicitly satisfy this assumption by imposing _",
    "periodic boundary conditions _ on the cosmic peculiar  fields : periodicity means that we can alternatively view the universe as a torus .",
    "a torus is a compact space without boundary , and consequently any flux through the boundary vanishes exactly .      in this subsection",
    "we shall write down the _ general _ first  order solution in order to see that we need quite a list of arguments to reduce it to what we call the `` zeldovich  approximation '' @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "a solution to the basic system of equations ( 8) is _ general _ , if we can specify initial data for the velocity _ independently _ of a given density field ( or acceleration field , respectively ) . if we split these data into their homogeneous parts ( belonging to the background solution ) and deviations from the background , _ peculiar  velocity _ @xmath132 and _ peculiar  acceleration _",
    "@xmath136 , then we have to specify @xmath137 where we have splitted the peculiar ",
    "velocity into its irrotational ( longitudinal ) part @xmath138 and its rotational ( transverse ) part @xmath139 ( the acceleration is irrotational in newton s theory ) .",
    "we may introduce scalar potentials and a vector potential such that @xmath140 solving the lagrange ",
    "newton system to the first order with the perturbation ansatz ( 17 ) we obtain @xmath141 : @xmath142 where the @xmath143 depend on the chosen background solution @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and the @xmath3dependent perturbation potentials have to obey poisson equations which relate them to the initial data ( 19b ) : @xmath146 ( @xmath147 denotes the laplace operator with respect to lagrangian coordinates . )    the solution ( 20 ) shows that the evolution of a fluid element depends ( non  locally ) on the distribution of all fluid elements , because poisson equations have to be solved ( which is clear in view of the structure of the theory ) .",
    "the rotational part stems from the lagrangian equations ( 8a  c ) which must not be forgotten ! only at first order",
    "the rotational part directly represents rotational flow in eulerian space . at higher orders rotational parts arise also for irrotational flow",
    "this can be explained by the following consideration : imagine an arrow for which we require that it keeps a fixed angle to some axis in an eulerian coordinate system .",
    "the arrow may be placed on a system which is orbiting around some point . in this",
    "( lagrangian ) system the arrow performs a rotating movement , while in eulerian space it is just translationally shifted .",
    "indeed , if we restrict the motion to be irrotational in lagrangian space , then this restricts possible classes of motion far more than the requirement of irrotational motion in eulerian space .",
    "let us return to the solution ( 20 ) . at first order it is straightforward to solve the @xmath148 poisson equations ( 20a  e ) explicitly : @xmath149 @xmath150 we can get rid of the harmonic functions @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 and we can make @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 unique , if we impose periodic boundary conditions on the initial data : the only periodic harmonic functions are constant in space , a constant which expresses a translation of the whole simulation box and which can be set to zero , since the basic equations are translationally invariant ( see @xmath157 , appendix c and @xmath61 ) .",
    "if we do nt do that then the solutions are not unique ! removing this freedom reduces ( 20 ) to a _",
    "local _ approximation which is only possible at first order .",
    "for the purpose of simulating the evolution of large  scale structure forward in time we can simplify the solution further by assuming that , initially @xmath158 i.e. , peculiar  velocity and acceleration are parallel to start with ( in particular , we have @xmath159 ) .",
    "this assumption is justified on physical grounds : as long as the perturbations are small , we may describe them by the ( eulerian ) linear theory .",
    "then , asymptotically ( after the decaying modes have died out ) the condition ( 22 ) is approximately reached and we may start with this condition from the outset . employing ( 22 ) the first",
    " order solution reduces to the `` zeldovich  approximation '' ( compare @xmath141 for the einstein  de sitter background , and @xmath59 , @xmath160 for general backgrounds including a cosmological constant to see that the time  coefficients come out right ) : @xmath161 note that , strictly speaking , ( 23 ) is not the growing part of the general solution , but is that part which results from the restriction ( 22 ) on initial data : this restriction automatically cancels the decaying modes at first order , but not at higher orders .",

    "strictly speaking , the lagrangian perturbation approach is limited by construction to the regime @xmath189 , , where @xmath190 this condition is very conservative in view of the success of these approximations if followed up to shell  crossing , i.e. , @xmath191 and beyond ( see coles lecture ) .",
    "the condition ( 27 ) has its counterpart in the condition @xmath192 in eulerian perturbation theory . at the epoch of shell ",

    "newton system is still regular in this regime , i.e. , the individual trajectories do nt feel their intersection with others ) .",
    "this demands that we must argue whether and how this extrapolation is justified .",
    "the examples given in the previous subsection suggest that the extrapolation can indeed be meaningful .    as mentioned earlier , in the regime after shell  crossing @xmath66 , the mapping @xmath13 is no longer unique and the inverse @xmath70 is multivalued .",
    "if we assume that the density can be written as a superposition of the partial densities corresponding to the different streams , then a reasonable extension into the multi  stream regime for the density is @xmath193 the total density in the @xmath194stream region is the sum of the moduli of the individual densities of the streams .",
    "this extension is implicitly used when we construct the density field from displaced particles : the formula ( 28 ) is approximated by the collection of particles in an eulerian grid at times after shell  crossing . however , due to the presence of self  gravity the streams interact and the formula ( 28 ) has to be taken with caution . indeed , expressing the superposition assumption in terms of the accelerations we encounter a problem : in the multi ",
    "stream region there are @xmath194 fluid elements at the same eulerian position , thus the total gravitational field strength at this position would have to be added up similar to ( 28 ) and the fluid particle should be pushed by this total strength . on the contrary",
    ", the lagrangian solutions still push the fluid elements with their individual accelerations . in other words ,",
    "einstein s equivalence principle of inertial and gravitational mass is violated : the particles are not accelerated by the total gravitational field strength .",
    "we have to find extensions of the theory presented ( e.g. , in the framework of the vlasov  poisson system ) to properly deal with this problem .    the performance of the lagrangian perturbation solutions after shell  crossing as inferred from a number of comparisons with n ",
    "body simulations appears to be weak due to the shortcomings discussed above .",
    "this is most easily visible in pancake models @xmath195 .",
    "if we consider hierarchical cosmogonies , especially models which involve much small  scale power , then the power spectrum of fluctuations must be sufficiently steep to avoid shell  crossing on small scales .",
    "otherwise , these high  frequency components have to be truncated or filtered ( see coles lecture and ref . therein ) . in the former case ,",
    "a spectral index @xmath196 in a power law spectrum @xmath197 lies close to the limit between `` pancake  type '' and `` hierarchical '' cosmogonies having @xmath198 .",
    "this is so , because in the case @xmath196 the integrated power per wave number interval is approximately constant ( logarithmic ) , so that all waves enter the nonlinear regime at about the same time ( fig.5 ) . for more small  scale power",
    "the smoothing scale of high  frequency modes has to be close to ( but smaller than ) the nonlinearity scale . in fig.6 ,",
