    "a good approximation for @xmath156 is taken over the distribution of @xmath157 , @xmath158 is the optimal @xmath156 . ] to be @xmath158 so that @xmath159 now , for linear stbcs of the form @xmath160 , the signal model given in can be rewritten as @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the identity matrix of size @xmath163 , @xmath130 is the generator matrix defined in definition [ gen_mat ] and @xmath164 is the vector of information symbols belonging to @xmath165 . for this model ,",

    "if @xmath136 given by is unitary , so is @xmath130 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the expressions for both @xmath172 and @xmath171 are obtained for _ gaussian inputs _ ( since the entropy of the output is maximized if and only if the input is gaussian ) . in the case of stbcs ,",
    "the inputs information symbols take values from @xmath51 which is @xmath54-qam or @xmath54-hex , and all the signal points are equally likely to be chosen so that the pmf of @xmath50 is @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "so , for the signal model @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 , the constellation constrained mutual information @xmath178 is not given by but by the following expression @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the modified shaping criterion can be separated into two subcriteria which are    c3.1 : :    the _ average _ energy required to transmit the linear combination of    the information symbols on each layer is equal to the _ average _ energy    used for sending the information symbols themselves , i.e. ,    @xmath151 ,    @xmath138 , where the expectation is over the    distribution of @xmath152 which by assumption has a    pmf given by @xmath153 ,    @xmath154 .",

    "the reason for coming up with c3.2 is that no symbol should be favoured over other symbols with respect to energy required for transmission .",
    "we assume that the average energy of @xmath185 is @xmath186 so that @xmath187 , and because of the symmetry of @xmath54-qam and @xmath54-hex , we have @xmath188 .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath189 so that @xmath190 given by is unitary , since it is a necessary condition for c4 to be satisfied . with these assumptions , we have the following proposition .",
    "c3.1 , c3.2 and c4 are together satisfied if and only if @xmath136 given by is such that all of its rows and columns have a euclidean norm equal to unity .",
    "we prove that if c3.1 , c3.2 and c4 are together satisfied , then @xmath136 shall be such that all of its rows and columns have a euclidean norm equal to unity .",
