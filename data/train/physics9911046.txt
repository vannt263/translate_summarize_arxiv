    "it is up to now still not possible to carry out computations of ionization probabilities or ionization rates in the high intensity regime in a totally satisfactory manner . in particular analytical results",
    "are extremely rare . especially concerning the issue of so - called atomic stabilization @xcite",
    ", numerous computations may be found in the literature which are contradictory in many cases .",
    "alone for the relatively simple problem of the one - dimensional delta - potential there exist various recent computations which do @xcite or do not @xcite support the existence of stabilization . roughly speaking , stabilization is the effect that the ionization probability ( or ionization rate to some authors ) as a function of the laser field intensity is decreasing or constant in some region . for further references and a more detailed terminology ,",
    "that is , a distinction into transient , adiabatic , interference or resonance stabilization , see for instance @xcite",
    ".    it would be highly desirable to settle the controversial issue and pinpoint possible mistakes , erroneous physical or mathematical assumptions made in the course of the computations .",
    "the main intention of this note is to contribute to this debate and provide additional alternative consistency criteria . for this purpose",
    "we analyze the scaling behaviour of several quantities involved in the calculations which address the above - mentioned problem .",
    "this constitutes an adaptation of an idea which has been proved to be extremely powerful in the context of quantum field theory , for instance in form of the renormalization group flow ( see almost any book on quantum field theory ) . in the context of atomic physics , scaling laws",
    "have been considered before @xcite in a `` semiempirical '' fashion , as the authors refer themselves to their own analysis . in order to overcome the slightly ad hoc way of arguing we provide in this note a systematic derivation of various scaling laws , which are compatible with the ones proposed in @xcite . in particular , we establish the scale invariance property of the ionization probability . as a consequence one may exploit these symmetry properties and check various analytical as well as numerical expressions for the ionization probability for consistency . in addition , when considering the ionization probability as a function of various parameters the scale invariance property allows to trade one particular variable for others .",
    "this permits to interpret and rigorously explain various types of behaviour which occurred before for more specific situations in the literature .",
    "for instance , for the hydrogen atom it was found in @xcite that for increasing principal quantum number the ionization probability decreased and in @xcite the opposite behaviour was observed .",
    "our analysis culminates in the formulation of a simple alternative criterium for the existence of stabilization .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive systematically the scaling properties of various quantities and establish in particular the invariance of the ionization probability under scaling .",
    "we show that this property is preserved under gauge invariance .",
    "furthermore , the scale invariance can be exploited as a consistency check in various computations .",
    "we exhibit this for explicit analytical expressions , for perturbative calculations , for approximate evaluations in form of kramers - henneberger- and floquet states and for upper and lower bound estimates .",
    "we demonstrate how the scaling properties can be exploited to trade some variables for others and use this feature to explain several types of physical behaviour . as a consequence of our analysis in section 2 ,",
    "we provide in section 3 a differential equation which has to be satisfied by the ionization probability and an alternative criterium for the existence of stabilization .",
    "we state our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "we consider an atom with potential @xmath0 in the presence of a sufficiently intense laser field , such that it may be described in the non - relativistic regime by the time - dependent schrdinger equation in the dipole approximation @xmath1 we further take the pulse to be of the general form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a function whose integral over @xmath4 is assumed to be well behaved , with @xmath5 unless @xmath6 .",
    "this means @xmath7 is the pulse duration , @xmath3 the pulse shape function and @xmath8 the amplitude of the pulse , which we take to be positive without loss of generality .    denoting by @xmath9 the dilatation factor and by @xmath10 the scaling dimension of the eigenfunction @xmath11 of the hamiltonian @xmath12 , we consider the following scale transformations , such that the transformation of the eigenfunction is described by @xmath13 and operators @xmath14 acting on @xmath15 transform as @xmath16 . ]",
    "@xmath17 making the physical assumption that the hilbert space norm remains invariant , i.e. @xmath18 , we deduce immediately that the scaling dimension has to be @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the dimension of the space .",
    "introducing now the scaling of the dimensional parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 we can scale the whole problem to atomic units , i.e. @xmath24 , for instance by the choice @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . staying for the time being in these units the scaling behaviour ( [ dilatation ] ) may be realized by scaling the coupling constant .",
    "considering for instance the wavefunction @xmath29 of the only bound state when the potential in ( [ schro ] ) is taken to be the one - dimensional delta - potential @xmath30 , equation ( [ dilatation ] ) imposes that the coupling constant has to scale as @xmath31 .",
    "choosing instead the coulomb potential in the form @xmath32 requires the same scaling behaviour of the coupling constant for ( [ dilatation ] ) to be valid .",
    "this is exhibited directly by the explicit expressions of the corresponding wavefunctions @xmath33 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    from a physical point of view",
    "it is natural to require further , that the scaling behaviour of the wavefunction is the same for all times @xmath34 consequently this means that the time evolution operator should be an invariant quantity under these transformations @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the time ordering .",
    "equation ( [ tevol ] ) then suggests that the scaling of the time has to be compensated by the scaling of the hamiltonian and planck s constant in order to achieve invariance . scaling therefore the time as @xmath37 with @xmath38 being unknown for the moment , equation ( [ tevol ] ) only holds if the stark hamiltonian of equation ( [ schro ] ) scales as @xmath39 the properties ( [ tscale ] ) and ( [ hd ] )",
    "could also be obtained by demanding the invariance of the schrdinger equation ( [ schro ] ) .",
    "the overall scaling behaviour of @xmath40 is governed by the scaling of the laplacian , the electron mass and planck s constant , such that we obtain the further constraint @xmath41 @xmath42as a consequence we can read off the scaling properties of the potential as @xmath43 what does this behaviour imply for some concrete potentials ? having scaled everything to atomic units , relation ( [ eh ] ) suggests that @xmath44 . considering for this situation the one - dimensional delta - potential and the coulomb potential in the forms specified above , equation ( [ ve ] ) imposes that the coupling constant has to scale as @xmath45 in both cases .",
    "this behaviour of the coupling constant is in agreement with our earlier observations for the corresponding wavefunctions .",
    "we also observe immediately that the behaviour ( [ ve ] ) may be realized for the general class of kato small potentials .",
    "we recall that if for each constant @xmath46 with @xmath47 there exists a constant @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 holds for all @xmath50 in the domain @xmath51 , the potential @xmath52 is called kato small .",
    "we see immediately that the scaling of the first term is entirely governed by the laplacian such that @xmath53 is scale invariant and that @xmath48 has to scale as @xmath54 due to the scale invariance of the norm",
    ".    it is intriguing to note that there exists an interesting class of potentials which scale alone via their dependence on @xmath55 and which do not contain any energy scale @xmath56 at all , as for instance @xmath57 or the two - dimensional delta potential .",
    "in @xcite the interesting proposal was made to exploit the scaling behaviour in order to use known properties of the hydrogen atom to understand the behaviour of helium .",
    "for this purpose the schrdinger equation describing helium , i.e. ( [ schro ] ) , for the potential @xmath58 and the mass @xmath59 replaced by the reduced mass @xmath60 , is scaled to the one which describes hydrogen . translating the quantities of @xcite into our conventions this transformation",
    "is realized by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these quantities are consistent with the additional constraint @xmath66 which results for the potential @xmath67 from the scaling arguments .",
    "we would like to point out that this is only one of many possible choices .",
    "it might be more convenient to use for instance @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 instead .",
    "we will now consider the constraint resulting from equation ( [ hd ] ) on the scaling behaviour of the pulse .",
    "we have @xmath73 this equation is not quite as restrictive as for the potential , since in the latter case we could determine the behaviour of the coupling whereas now a certain ambiguity remains in the sense that we can only deduce @xmath74 thus , under the assumptions we have made , it is not possible to disentangle the contribution coming from the scaling of the amplitude or the pulse shape function .",
    "however , there might be pulse shape functions for which @xmath75 has to be @xmath76 , since no suitable parameter is available in its explicit form to achieve the scaling .",
    "finally , we come to the scaling behaviour of the ionization probability . denoting by @xmath77 the orthogonal projection in @xmath78 onto the subspace spanned by the bound states of @xmath12 , the ionization probability turns out to be a scale invariant quantity @xmath79 this follows by means of ( [ dilatation ] ) , ( [ tevol ] ) and by noting that the projection operator has to be a scale invariant quantity ,",
    "i.e. @xmath80 . from a physical point of view this is clear unless we were able to scale bound states into the continuum , which is impossible , since negative energies will remain always negative even after being scaled .",
    "mathematically this means we have to demand that @xmath81 and @xmath77 are related to each other by a unitary transformation .",
    "we recapitulate that our sole assumptions in this derivation were to demand the invariance of the hilbert space norm , i.e. @xmath82 , and that the scaling of the wavefunction is preserved for all times .",
    "we shall now utilize this symmetry property in various approaches , which can be carried out either numerically or analytically . at this point",
    "we scale everything to atomic units which we will use from now onwards .",
    "first of all we would like to establish that these scaling properties hold in every gauge , as one naturally expects .",
    "we recall that different gauges are related by a time - dependent unitary operator @xmath83 .",
    "for instance the wavefunction in gauge @xmath84 and gauge @xmath85 are related as @xmath86 .",
    "the velocity gauge is obtained from the length gauge by @xmath87 the velocity gauge from the kramers - henneberger gauge by @xmath88 and the length gauge from the kramers - henneberger gauge by @xmath89 the defining relations for the classical momentum transfer @xmath90 , the classical displacement @xmath91 and the classical energy transfer @xmath92 then yield    @xmath93    these quantities scale in the expected manner , that is @xmath90 scales as a momentum , @xmath91 as the space and @xmath92 remains invariant . taking these properties into account",
    ", we observe easily that the operator @xmath94 is an invariant quantity under scaling @xmath95 for all cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 mentioned .",
    "hence the scaling behaviour is preserved in all gauges .",
    "it is interesting to note that one may reverse the logic here and deduce from a broken scale invariance onto a broken gauge invariance .",
    "however , in general gauge invariance is not broken in such a crude manner , e.g. in @xcite ( see eqn . ( 22 ) therein ) the gauge invariance is broken in a scale invariant fashion .      keeping the pulse shape function invariant under the scaling transformations we incorporate now the explicit functional dependence into the ionization probability .",
    "the fundamental parameters are the field amplitude , the pulse length and the coupling constant .",
    "the previous observations then suggest that @xmath97 assuming from now on that the coupling constant scales as for the one - dimensional delta- and the coulomb potential , the meaning of equation ( [ invp ] ) is that the ionization probability remains invariant under the transformations @xmath98    we can exploit the symmetry property ( [ invp ] ) most easily when we have an explicit analytical expression for @xmath99 at hand . considering for example",
    "the @xmath100-potential and taking the pulse to be the @xmath100-kick , i.e. @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 the ionization probability of the bound state was computed to be @xcite @xmath104 obviously the r.h.s . of ( [ dd ] ) passes the test and remains invariant under the scale transformation in form of ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ tran ] ) .",
    "usually one is not in the fortunate situation to have explicit expressions for the ionization probability available as in the previous subsection .",
    "however , the symmetry property may also be utilized when computing @xmath105 approximately either in a numerical or analytical fashion .",
    "we recall that the essential ingredient of perturbation theory is to expand the time evolution operator as a series in @xmath8 or @xmath56 for small or large field intensities , respectively .",
    "we can formally write    @xmath106    since @xmath107 is a scale invariant quantity , the invariance property ( [ tevol ] ) must hold order by order , that is for @xmath108 we have @xmath109 considering now for instance the high intensity regime and performing gordon - volkov perturbation theory ( e.g. @xcite ) , the first terms in ( [ se ] ) read @xmath110 whilst it was fairly obvious that the general expressions ( [ u0 ] ) and ( [ u1 ] ) remain invariant under scaling , this consistency check might be less trivial when carried out after the expressions have been evaluated explicitly either numerically or analytically .",
    "the essence of the kramers - henneberger approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) is to exploit the fact that when the gauge transformation ( [ gkg ] ) is carried out on the stark hamiltonian , the term involving the laser pulse disappears and instead the potential is shifted by the total classical displacement , i.e. @xmath111 . having chosen the pulse in such a way that @xmath91 is a periodic function in time , one can expand the shifted potential in a fourier series @xmath112 in the kramers - henneberger approximation one assumes now that the zero mode is dominant such that the remaining terms may be treated as perturbations . from the scaling behaviour of the l.h.s .",
    "of ( [ kha ] ) we deduce immediately that the frequency has to scale inverse to the time , i.e. @xmath113 , and that each mode in the series scales in the same way as the potential , i.e. @xmath114 as an example let us consider the expansion for a square - well potential of depth @xmath115 and of width @xmath20 subjected to a pulse of linearly polarized monochromatic light .",
    "the modes are of the general form ( first reference in @xcite ) @xmath116\\,\\ , ,   \\label{vns}\\ ] ] where the explicit formula of the function @xmath117 is given in term of chebyshev - polynomials which , however , is not important for our purpose .",
    "we only need to know that it scales by means of its argument alone .",
    "since the argument is scale invariant , we observe with the help of ( [ ve ] ) for @xmath118 in atomic units that ( [ vn ] ) holds for each coefficient in ( [ vns ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the scaling behaviour of the floquet expansion is very similar . instead of exploiting the periodicity of the potential",
    "one makes additional use of the periodicity of the field and expands @xmath119 .",
    "it is then obvious by the same reasoning as before that the scaling of the individual modes has to be the same as for the field itself , i.e. @xmath120 .      in @xcite analytical expressions for upper and lower bounds , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,",
    "respectively , were derived and analyzed .",
    "depending on the particular parameters these expressions put more or less severe constraints on the actual value of @xmath105 , in the sense that @xmath123 . since @xmath105 is a scale invariant quantity , also the bounds have to respect this symmetry .",
    "otherwise they could be scaled to any desired value .",
    "we present just one example for one particular upper bound ( the arguments carry through equally for lower bounds ) to convince ourselves that this is indeed the case .",
    "for instance under the condition @xmath124 binding energy of @xmath125 , the following upper bound was derived in @xcite @xmath126 it is easy to see term by term that the r.h.s . of ( [ pu ] )",
    "scales invariantly . in @xcite",
    "we have already exploited this property .",
    "in fact , we found that the bound ( [ pu ] ) is only considerably below 1 for very small values of the pulse length @xmath7 . since the binding energy has to scale in the same manner as the hamiltonian @xmath127 , that is @xmath128 , we could also , due to the scale invariance property , enlarge the pulse durations by considering higher rydberg states . in this way we could study pulses which are physically more conceivable , at the cost of having to deal with higher principal quantum numbers .",
    "of course the principle mentioned at the end of the last subsection is very general and we may always trade some variables for others , simply by bringing the relevant @xmath129 s in ( [ tran ] ) to the other side of the equation .",
    "for instance from @xmath130it follows that instead of varying the field amplitude and keeping @xmath7 and @xmath56 fixed , we could equivalently keep @xmath8 fixed and vary simultaneously @xmath7 and @xmath56 in the described fashion . as a consequence we can give some alternative physical interpretation to the extreme intensity limit considered in @xcite @xmath131 this means switching off the potential and exposing the atom to an infinitely long pulse with some finite field amplitude is equivalent to keeping the pulse length and the coupling constant finite and taking the field amplitude to infinity .",
    "figure 1 : part ( a ) shows the ionization probability as a function of the field amplitude @xmath8 for a @xmath100-potential atom subjected to a @xmath100-kick pulse ( [ dd ] ) for @xmath132 and various coupling constants .",
    "part ( b ) shows the ionization probability to zeroth order gordon - volkov perturbation theory as a function of the field amplitude @xmath8 for a @xmath100-potential atom subjected to a double @xmath100-kick pulse of the form @xmath133@xmath134 for @xmath135 and various coupling constants .",
    "notice that for this pulse the conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 hold .",
    "for a detailed derivation see @xcite .",
    "we can also use the scale invariance property to give a simple explanation to a behaviour , which at first sight appears somewhat puzzling .",
    "in @xcite it was observed that the ionization probability is sometimes a decreasing and sometimes an increasing function of the coupling constant when the other parameters are kept fixed , refer to figure 1 .",
    "important for the explanation of this feature is that in the former case @xmath138 and in the latter @xmath139 .",
    "assuming now that the dependence of the ionization probability on the field amplitude enters only through the quantities @xmath140 and @xmath141 and in addition that the dependence on the pulse length is very weak in comparison with the one on @xmath142 and @xmath56 , according to the scale invariance property we can write @xmath143 thus , in case the functional dependence on @xmath141 is much weaker than the one on @xmath140 , we have to increase the coupling constant when the total classical momentum transfer is increased in order to keep the ionization probability fixed . noting that @xmath144 , this is expected from the classical point of view , since to free a more deeply bound state with the same probability requires a larger momentum transfer . in the reversed case ,",
    "in which the functional dependence on @xmath141 is much stronger than the one on @xmath140 we have to decrease the coupling constant when the total classical displacement is increased in order to keep the ionization probability at the same value .",
    "also this behaviour is expected from a classical point of view , since when a less deeply bound state is freed with the same probability , it will be further displaced .",
    "the behaviour in figure 1 is therefore explained by relation ( [ bcp ] ) .",
    "note that in figure 1(b ) the value of @xmath145 , which of course has to be zero , is a measure for the poor quality of the zeroth order gordon - volkov perturbation theory , at least in this low intensity regime .",
    "finally it is worth to note that the crossover which takes place for the curves of @xmath146 and @xmath147 indicates that in fact ( [ bcp ] ) is not exact and the pulse length has to be scaled also .",
    "it is not an indication that the higher order terms need to be taken into account , since , as we discussed in subsection 2.3 , scale invariance holds order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "as a consequence of ( [ invp ] ) it is elementary to derive a differential equation which has to be satisfied by the ionization probability @xmath148 as an example one may easily convince oneself that ( [ dd ] ) indeed satisfies ( [ diffe ] ) .    one way to speak of stabilization is when the ionization probability as a function of the field amplitude satisfies @xmath149 for @xmath150 on a finite interval .",
    "noting now that the transformation of the length scale is a symmetry for the ionization probability , i.e. relation ( [ ion ] ) , we have @xmath151 @xmath152 .",
    "then , according to the differential equation ( [ diffe ] ) , the criterium ( [ stab ] ) for the existence of stabilization may be written alternatively as @xmath153 once again it will be instructive to verify this statement for an explicit example .",
    "we believe that hitherto no analytical expression for the ionization probability is known which obeys the strict inequality in ( [ stab ] ) . however , it was shown @xcite that in the extreme intensity limit @xmath154 the equal sign holds . in particular when @xmath155 one obtains non - trivial expressions in this case .",
    "taking for instance the potential to be the @xmath100-potential in three dimensions , the ionization probability of the only bound state was computed to @xcite @xmath156 with @xmath157 being the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "obviously ( [ ex2 ] ) satisfies the criterium ( [ crit ] ) for the equal sign .",
    "it is interesting to note that for potentials which do not possess an energy scale , like the ones mentioned after ( [ ve ] ) , relation ( [ crit ] ) reduces to @xmath158 for @xmath159 on a finite interval .",
    "this means that for increasing pulse length the ionization probability should decrease , which is as counterintuitive as the statement ( [ stab ] ) .",
    "we have shown that transforming the length scale corresponds to a symmetry in the ionization probability @xmath105 .",
    "we demonstrated that this symmetry property may be used as a consistency check in various approximation methods in numerical or analytical form .",
    "one should also note that every numerical code which fully solves the schrdinger equation can be tested for consistency by appropriately scaling all variables .",
    "moreover one can employ the scale invariance to avoid certain problems which sometimes plague numerical calculations as for instance the occurrence of very small numbers near machine precision or of very large numbers .",
    "by re - scaling all parameters one might be able to avoid such difficulties and still describe exactly the same physical situation .",
    "we like to stress that none of the above considerations is restricted to a particular intensity regime of the pulse in comparison with the potential and they hold for low as well as ultra high intensities , although the latter regime is of course currently of more interest .",
    "the above considerations may of course be carried out also for other quantities of interest like ionization rates @xmath160 , harmonic spectra etc .",
    "it follows for instance immediately that the ionization rate has to scale inverse to the time , i.e. @xmath161 .",
    "fermi s golden rule scales for instance in this way .    as an outlook one should keep in mind that like in numerous other situations the physics becomes more interesting when",
    "the symmetry is broken .",
    "for instance for the two - dimensional delta potential we noted already that there is a priori no energy scale available .",
    "however , these potentials suffer from ultraviolet divergencies at the origin which have to be renormalised . through this procedure one",
    "then introduces an additional scale , which is a situation reminiscent of relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "another interesting situation arises when we have more than one intrinsical physical scale in our system . in many situations",
    "one scale is dominating the other and the problem is reducible to one with only one parameter .",
    "however , there might intriguing situations in which the scales combine in an arbitrary complicated manner as for instance in a statistical physics problem where we have a microscopic length scale which specifies the typical distance between fluctuating magnetic degrees of freedom and the correlation length .",
