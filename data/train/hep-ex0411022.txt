    "neutrino oscillations have been observed at three different mass scales : @xmath2 @xmath3 8x@xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3 2x@xmath6 , and @xmath7 @xmath8 . in the standard model",
    "there are three active neutrinos , and a summation law exists such that @xmath9 + @xmath10 = @xmath11 .",
    "the three mass scales of observed oscillations do not follow this law . therefore , one of the results is faulty or there exists physics beyond the standard model .",
    "solar and atmospheric oscillations have been observed and confirmed by several experiments .",
    "miniboone will make a definitive test of the lsnd  @xcite signal .",
    "miniboone is a fixed target experiment located at fermi national laboratory .",
    "the fermilab booster provides miniboone with an 8 gev proton beam .",
    "protons are directed onto a beryllium target located inside a magnetic focusing horn .",
    "approximately 3x@xmath12 protons per 1.6 @xmath13 pulse arrive at the miniboone target at a rate of 5 hz . the interaction of the protons with the target produces a stream of charged mesons . magnetically focusing the mesons increases the neutrino flux by a factor of 6 . after focusing",
    ", the mesons travel into a 50 meter decay region where they decay in flight to produce the @xmath14 beam . the @xmath14 travel through 490 meters of a dirt absorber before entering the miniboone detector .",
    "the energy of these neutrinos is @xmath3 700 mev , providing an l / e of @xmath3 0.8 m / mev ( compared to lsnd l / e of @xmath31 m / mev ) .",
    "the miniboone detector is a 12 meter diameter sphere , filled with undoped mineral oil .",
    "the tank consists of two regions : an inner light - tight region , lined with 1280 pmts to provide 10% photocathode coverage , and an outer optically isolated veto - region containing 240 pmts .",
    "different beam energy , beam duty cycle , and oil give miniboone drastically different systematic errors than those found at lsnd .",
    "there are three main components to all of the analyses at miniboone : flux prediction , calibration of the data , and particle identification .",
    "the neutrino beam which enters the miniboone tank contains @xmath14 and some intrinsic @xmath15 .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath15 is thought to be @xmath3 0.5% of the @xmath14 flux and is comparable to the amount of @xmath15 expected from a positive oscillation signal .",
    "miniboone relies on data from the e910  @xcite and harp  @xcite experiments to aid in understanding beam flux and cross sections .",
    "these two experiments directed a proton beam in the miniboone energy range ( 8 - 12 gev ) onto a beryllium target .",
    "the _ in situ _ kaon flux at miniboone is measured using a scintillating fiber tracker located in a small beam - pipe at an angle of 6 degrees to the decay region .",
    "cross sections are found using miniboone data as well as data from other experiments .",
    "seven optically isolated scintillating cubes located throughout the detector , combined with a muon tracker located directly above the tank , identify stopping muons and allow for identification of a sample of michel electrons of known position for energy calibration .",
    "the high end of the michel electron energy spectrum is used to fix the detector energy scale .",
    "miniboone currently has a 14.8% energy reconstruction at 50 mev .",
    "miniboone has yet to settle on a final particle i d algorithm for the oscillation analysis .",
    "we are exploring the use of neural nets and boosting algorithms .",
    "the goal of the miniboone oscillation @xmath15 appearance analysis is to explore all of the lsnd 90% confidence region to the 4 - 5 sigma level . with our current estimates of neutrino fluxes and reconstruction efficiencies ,",
    "@xmath16 protons on target ( p.o.t ) will be required for this .",
    "to date miniboone has received 3.66x@xmath17 p.o.t .",
    "this produces greater than 380k neutrino events , out of @xmath31 million expected for the final appearance analysis , as estimated by our event generation model .",
    "the 380k can be broken down in the following way : 250 k from charged current ( cc ) events , 60k from neutral current ( nc ) elastic , and 26k from nc @xmath18 events .",
    "the charged current results are covered by another speaker in these proceedings .",
    "@xcite      neutral current elastic events will be used for measuring the component of the proton spin carried by strange quarks .",
    "this event class is also currently being used to study scintillation properties of oil and the low energy response of the detector which are both additionally useful for the @xmath15 appearance analysis .",
    "current results for this analysis have been presented previously .",
    "@xcite      neutral current @xmath18 events are the dominant mis - identification background to the @xmath15 appearance oscillation analysis .",
    "the cross section combined with the angular production distribution also constrains the coherent and resonant production mechanism of these events .",
    "reconstruction of the @xmath18 mass peak gives a 55% sample purity with 42% efficiency in the mass peak .",
    "the events in the mass peak are used to plot the @xmath18 momentum .",
    "the @xmath18 momentum spectrum plot shows excellent agreement between data and monte carlo .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : one ] . )",
    "miniboone analyses and data taking are proceeding well . analysis algorithms",
    "have successfully identified cc , nc @xmath18 , and nc elastic interactions .",
