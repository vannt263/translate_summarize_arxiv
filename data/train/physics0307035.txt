    "since the early experiments on mode conversion in film - waveguide magneto - optical systems  @xcite and the subsequent theoretical works  @xcite it has become clear that an equality between propagation constants of the two guided modes  otherwise called mode matching or perfect phase matching  can be realized exclusively due to the tensorial character of dielectric permittivity of the waveguiding slab , i.e. due to its either natural or induced anisotropy . an obvious way to gain anisotropy is to produce a waveguide layer of monocrystalline material possessing intrinsic birefringence ; another possibility is provided by use of gyrotropic waveguides ( for example , yig on ggg ) subject to an external dc magnetic field .",
    "historically , it was the latter way that experimentalists followed , probably because of its higher flexibility and technical reliability .",
    "a number of device schemes implementing that principle were rapidly proposed , from an optical switch  @xcite to a sensitive experimental method of determining the permittivity tensor elements  @xcite .",
    "the two unpleasant drawbacks were then the complexity of the schemes and the comparatively high absorption in gyrotropic films that hindered their utilization , e.g. for intermodal dispersion - free planar propagation .",
    "on the other hand , in recent years a certain interest in traditional multilayer dielectric mirrors from the viewpoint of photonic bandgap localization has been observed , stimulated probably by the unexpected discovery of total omnidirectional reflection from an appropriately designed one - dimensional dielectric lattice , i.e. an actual photonic band gap exhibited in case of such a simple geometry  @xcite .",
    "what looks now curious but is important for the purpose of the present treatment is that one can easily see the points of perfect phase matching of te and tm modes on the standard band structure diagrams of dielectric multilayers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch  4 ) , yet unfortunately little or no attention has been paid in the literature to those mode matching phenomena  in spite of so many promising applications including polarization - insensitive , intermodal dispersion - free planar waveguiding , efficient fibre - to - planar waveguide coupling and , potentially , mode filtering , drastic improvement of mode conversion efficiency and diffraction efficiency in magneto - optical bragg cells and others . to the best of our knowledge , the underlying idea that a multilayer waveguide can be regarded as a homogeneous , effectively anisotropic slab  and as if it were the case of a naturally birefringent or gyrotropic , magnetized waveguide , the perfect phase matching of te and tm modes must occur  has been formulated just recently  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to highlight and theoreticallly investigate the perfect phase matching of guided te and tm modes with a multilayer device composed of linear , isotropic , non - magnetic and non - absorbing materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "is devoted mainly to qualitative models and considerations : we begin with a transparent explanation for the mode matching phenomenon on the basis of conventional one - dimensional homogenization method and then discuss the general eigenproblem for te and tm modes in order to derive some basic requirements for the scheme , such as the minimum number of layers and the proper refractive index profile .",
    "strict analytical expressions for the modal dispersion structure of periodic dielectric stacks with two - layer and three - layer unit cells follow those qualitative speculations and are given in .",
    "finally , we analyse in several examples of perfect phase matching with simple planar structures composed of silicon and silicon - nitride layers , fully compatible with modern integrated optics techniques .",
    "a straightforward way to make the idea of perfect phase matching transparent is to consider a stack of isotropic dielectric layers as an effectively homogeneous , uniaxially birefringent medium , by means of the standard one - dimensional homogenization technique .",
    "this approach allows to expand the argumentation for the mode matching with anisotropic waveguides to the case of dielectric multilayers , with an important consequence that the mode matching is in principle possible with those structures too . to find the minimum number of layers required for the matching and to optimize the refractive index profile , we furthermore analyse the waveguiding conditions for te and tm modes in multilayer structures , tracking the fruitful analogy with confined one - dimensional electron states problem quite profoundly investigated in the framework of classical quantum mechanics and solid - state physics .      in a single - layer isotropic waveguide , the two given modes  te ( s - polarized ) and tm ( p - polarized)are commonly characterized at a fixed frequency by definitely different propagation angles @xmath1 between the wavevector and the plane of the guide , and consequently , by different ( non - equal ) propagation constants @xmath2 via @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the refractive index of the waveguiding medium and the subscripts @xmath5 and @xmath6 differentiate between te and tm modes .",
    "anisotropy of the waveguide accounts evidently for the following modification of equation ( 1 ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the indices ` seen ' by te and tm modes , and a situation like that in becomes possible , when the projections of the wave vectors of different modes onto the plane of guidance coincide , giving rise to the phenomenon of mode matching .",
    "( @xmath9 is the wave normal ) and propagation constants @xmath2 in a birefringent waveguiding medium . ]",
    "consider now a two - component periodic multilayer system consisting of layers of dielectric permittivity @xmath10 and thickness @xmath11 separated by layers with permittivity @xmath12 and thickness @xmath13 .",
    "if a plane wave is incident onto this array with its electric vector @xmath14 polarized parallel to the layers ( te - wave ) and the thicknesses @xmath15 and @xmath16 are small compared to the wavelength , then one may introduce the effective dielectric permittivity of the array as  @xcite @xmath17 and if the magnetic vector @xmath18 is parallel to the plates ( tm - wave ) , then the effective permittivity becomes  @xcite @xmath19    this treatment allows one to state that two isonormal , s- and p - polarized waves ` see ' in general different refractive indices of effective waveguiding medium , hence if to start from the isotropic ( @xmath20 ) case and then change one of the indices , the families of te and tm dispersion curves will undergo non - equal shifts on the dispersion structure diagram and thus intersect at a number of points , displaying the modes degeneration  the perfect phase matching .",
    "one should remember by the way that it is of course not complete , spatial degeneration of modes , but mere propagation constant coincidence .",
    "the question that naturally arises here is : how much layers are enough for the mode matching to occur ? in other words : when does the reasoning based on the form birefringence approach lose its validity ? to answer these questions and to elucidate the physics of mode matching in the case of a finite number of layers , one may find it convenient to employ an explicit mathematical analogy between confined photon and electron states , the latter being quite thoroughly investigated in classical quantum mechanics and solid - state physics  a comprehensible 1d kronig  penney model",
    "should certainly be mentioned here as an example .      as is commonly known and excellently described by joannopoulos  (",
    "* ch  3 ) , symmetry considerations allow us to separate the modes of planar dielectric waveguides into two classes : te and tm polarized . in a coordinate system",
    "in which the @xmath21-axis is normal to the bimedium interfaces and the light propagates along the @xmath22-direction , we can write for te and tm polarizations , respectively , @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angular frequency , @xmath26 is the vacuum speed of light , @xmath27 is what we call the propagation constant , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the unknown field distributions .",
    "substituting one of these fields into corresponding maxwell wave equation , in the case of permittivity @xmath30 being a step - wise function equal to @xmath31 for the @xmath32th homogeneous layer we obtain the following eigenproblem : @xmath33 this is the dispersion equation for a multilayer waveguide ; the difference between te and tm polarizations lies exclusively in different boundary conditions at the interfaces of the layers .",
    "thus , at the interface @xmath34 we have : @xmath35 conditions for the derivatives originate from continuity of @xmath22-components of magnetic and electric field vectors via maxwell equations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "note that the scalar helmholtz wave equation ( 7 ) with boundary conditions for the te mode ( 8) is isomorphous to the familiar stationary one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath38 for a particle of mass @xmath39 in potential energy profile @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the energy levels corresponding to eigenfunctions @xmath42 .",
    "the difference in boundary conditions for the derivatives of @xmath28 and @xmath29 functions leads to strict alternation of te and tm dispersion curves of one- and two - layer waveguides .",
    "in other words , at a fixed frequency @xmath25 the propagation constants of confined te modes are always separated by those of tm ones .",
    "this ` rule ' can be illustrated by for the lowest modes in a single - layer waveguide : the ratio @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the wavelength _ within _ the guide ) for the @xmath28 function of the te@xmath45 mode is obviously more than that for the tm@xmath45 mode because of the steeper slopes of the @xmath29 function near the interfaces due to the boundary conditions , but however high the refractive index of the guide and consequently the slopes of @xmath29 function in vicinity of the interfaces may be , the ratio @xmath43 for the tm@xmath45 mode will never drop below unity , while for the next te mode ",
    "te@xmath46it is definitely less than 1 , actually lying between 1/2 and 1 .",
    "similar argumentation still holds for the modal dispersion structure of a two - layer stack , no matter of the refractive index contrast of the layers , and , in general , for @xmath0-layer stack with refractive indices of the layers regularly increasing or decreasing throughout the array ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "surprisingly , a three - layer waveguide of step - wise refractive index profile develops considerably different from the above case , provided the second layer is of lower refractive index then its surroundings : @xmath49 .",
    "also assume for the sake of simplicity @xmath50 and , as before , symmetric sandwiching : @xmath51 for both ambient media .",
    "as it will now be argued , the mode matching can be effectively implemented with such a system ; to understand its origin , it might be a helpful trick to recall the changes in the system of eigenfunctions @xmath42 of an electron in one - dimensional three - step potential gap , each step being of width @xmath52 : @xmath53 with increasing @xmath54 from @xmath55 to @xmath56 that corresponds to decreasing @xmath57 from @xmath58 ( isotropic single - layer waveguide ) to unity ( two waveguide channels separated by air region ) , the frequency @xmath25 being fixed .    while the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath54 is negligible , the energy levels correspondent to @xmath42 eigenfunctions compose a relatively regular discrete energy spectrum , and so do the propagation constants of te modes at any fixed frequency .",
    "the tm mode spectrum is a bit shifted with respect to the te one due to the difference in boundary conditions for the modes of different types , and as just emphasized , the propagation constants of te and tm modes are strictly alternating .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath54 is large enough , the regions of low potential become weakly coupled , the entire system possessing the twofold ( generally @xmath0-fold , where @xmath0 is the number of regions of low potential  or high refractive index ) splitting of mixed odd and even energy levels corresponding to nearly degenerate te modal _ groups _ of @xmath0 modes each .",
    "tm modes also form similar @xmath0-fold groups which are , however , shifted with respect to te groups .",
    "it is clear now that for certain @xmath57 lying between those extremes , or equivalently , for certain frequency @xmath25 in case of @xmath57 being somewhat less than @xmath60 and fixed , the matching of te and tm modes should be expected , with the only exception for te@xmath45 mode in agreement with the inevitably negative character of form birefringence @xcite .",
    "we can also anticipate herefore that the minimum sufficient number of layers for the perfect phase matching is three , provided the central layer is of lower refractive index than the surrounding ones ",
    "see for an example of such a structure . more generally , the refractive index profile of the waveguide should have more than one maximum for the effective mode matching .",
    "consider now a kind of three - layer system ` reciprocal ' to the above  with a middle layer being of higher index than the lateral ones .",
    "for this third possible arrangement of the layers , the mode matching is not forbidden , yet there is seemingly no solid ground to expect the matching of the lowest modes now since such a system appears to stand close to conventional slab waveguide  the latter with no possibility for the mode matching at all .",
    "more thorough analysis in the manner above for a single - layer waveguide shows that coincidence of propagation constants should be expected for the modes _ of the same order _ , but as before with the exception of te@xmath45 and tm@xmath45 modes .",
    "it is demonstrated in that the mode matching is indeed observed in this case only in the multimode regime , thus actually losing its practical value .",
    "the general form ( 7)(9 ) of the dispersion equations for guided modes is quite good for qualitative analysis , but inconvenient for numerical investigations into the te and tm mode spectra of multilayer stacks . in the current section",
    "we render the known dispersion relations for multiperiod bilayer waveguides and present their generalization for three - layer multiperiod systems .",
    "thus , following yeh  @xcite , in case of an @xmath0-period stack with a _",
    "unit cell one has for te modes : @xmath61 \\nonumber\\\\ % \\bs   - \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\xi_{sub}}+\\frac{1}{\\xi_{cov } } \\right ) \\frac{\\sin [ ( n-1)\\lambda_{2s}]}{\\sin \\lambda_{2s } } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62,\\ ] ] @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the shorthand notation such as @xmath65 stands for the corresponding harmonic function product , in the case above , @xmath66 , with the free - space wave number @xmath67 .",

    ", @xmath0-period stack with a trilayer unit cell one can however quite trivially derive the following dispersion relation for the guided te modes ( see for the details ) : @xmath70 \\nonumber\\\\ % - \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\xi_{sub}}+\\frac{1}{\\xi_{cov } } \\right ) \\frac{\\sin [ ( n-1)\\lambda_{3s}]}{\\sin \\lambda_{3s } } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for tm modes : @xmath72 \\nonumber\\\\ % \\bs   - \\left ( \\frac{\\xi_{sub}}{\\epsilon_{sub}}+\\frac{\\xi_{cov}}{\\epsilon_{cov } } \\right ) \\frac{\\sin [ ( n-1)\\lambda_{3p}]}{\\sin \\lambda_{3p } } = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    of course , certain symmetries could obviously be found in these equations , but still the latter seem to be too cumbersome for any qualitative speculations . instead , one can easily do now plenty of computational work related to physically realizable multilayers , and in the following section we will do that with waveguides made of such popular optical materials as silicon and its compounds .",
    "to demonstrate the performance of dielectric multilayers for the mode matching and to corroborate theoretical considerations presented in , we have plotted in the modal dispersion curves of ( a ) two - layer @xmath74 and ( b ) three - layer @xmath75 waveguides , as well as of ( c , d ) their two - period counterparts .",
    "silicon and its nitride have been chosen deliberately since these materials are found to be suitable for manifold passive optical components like branching waveguides , couples , interconnects , interferometers , power splitters , and filters @xcite .",
    "we employed here the mode dispersion relations for bilayer and three - layer waveguides and their generalization for multiperiod systems , equations ( 12)(19 ) .",
    "the thicknesses of the layers were assumed to be equal ; the refractive indices are 3.5 ( si ) , 2.0 ( si@xmath76n@xmath77 ) and 1.5 ( sio@xmath78 ) .",
    "all the numerical calculations were performed with mathematica 4.1  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure 4(a ) is of no particular interest  we see the system of te and tm dispersion curves that is quite typical for slab dielectric waveguides , with just slight perturbations of the high - order modal curves near @xmath79that is close to the refractive index of the middle layer .",
    "in contrast , figure 4(b ) reveals the predicted intersection of modal dispersion curves for the three - layer system ; for the first phase - matching point where the tm@xmath45 mode matches te@xmath46 at @xmath80 ( here @xmath81 is the total thickness of one period , so that @xmath82 gives the thickness of the whole structure ) , we can estimate the thicknesses of the layers to be @xmath83  nm for operation near 1.55  @xmath84 m , i.e. in the spectral range for telecommunication frequencies . in order to improve the operation bandwidth",
    ", the slopes of dispersion curves at the given point of intersection must be as close as possible , and for that purpose the refractive index distribution should be further optimized .",
    "the comparison between figures 4(b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) confirms that it is the number of layers of high refractive index , and not periods  which sometimes are more ` mental ' constructs than ` physical ' objects  that determines the number of modes in the te and tm bands formed .",
    "thus , for both @xmath75 and @xmath85 structures constituted of two silicon layers  two ` potential gaps ' for photons  the twofold grouping of modes at high @xmath27 values is clearly observed .",
    "finally , testifies to the statement of that for the effective mode matching , the refractive index of the medium layer in three - layer waveguide should be low enough ; otherwise , the matching is not forbidden , but occurs only for high - order modes and remains thus impracticable .",
    "waveguide on silica substrate ",
    "the ` reverse ' structure of that in . ]",
    "in summary , the perfect phase matching of te and tm guided modes with a multilayer waveguide composed of linear isotropic dielectric materials has been anticipated and simulated for the first time .",
    "dielectric superlattices with unit cells of two types have been considered : two - layer and tree - layer ; for finite , @xmath0-period , three - component structures , the compact analytical expressions for the mode dispersion have been derived , which can be regarded as a self - sufficient result .",
    "numerical simulations performed for a silicon  silicon - nitride  silicon waveguide on a silica substrate bear witness that even a three - layer stack can be designed to exhibit at certain frequencies the perfect phase matching of te and tm guided modes . since the te and tm mode spectra are naturally very sensitive to refractive index distribution , i.e.  to the index contrast of the layers and their thicknesses , number and succession , wide possibilities arise to tailor the mode dispersion in the vicinity of those phase - matching points .",
    "the principle of perfect phase matching with a multilayer dielectric array has important potential implementations in polarization - insensitive planar propagation , fibre - to - planar waveguide coupling , mode conversion , filtering etc .",
    "the advantage of the presented device scheme is its simplicity and compatibility with common integrated optics techniques , e.g. with planar optical waveguide technology .",
    "further important issues to be addressed for the development of applicational aspects of the scheme are optimization with a more advanced refractive index profile of the waveguiding stack and integration into complex , state - of - the - art optical and optoelectronic elements .",
    "to derive the mode dispersion relation for the finite , @xmath0-period , three - layer dielectric superlattices , one can simply follow yeh s  @xcite reasoning for bilayer multiperiod waveguides , yet we prefer to utilize another tool here ",
    "the general , dyadic - based formalism for stratified media  @xcite which proves to be a competitive modification of berreman @xmath86 matrix approach  @xcite and can be directly applied to more complicated problems of light scattering and confined propagation in , e.g. , magnetized , metallo - dielectric and anisotropic arrays .    consider an @xmath0-period three - layer stack sandwiched between isotropic , homogeneous , semi - infinite media  a substrate of permittivity @xmath87 and a cover of permittivity @xmath88 .",
    "the covariant dispersion relation for plane - stratified media  @xcite takes the form @xmath89=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the unit 2-d dyadic , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the unit vectors in the plane of the guide , respectively parallel and perpendicular to the direction of propagation , @xmath93 denotes the outer product @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the evolution operator ( @xmath86 matrix ) that relates @xmath22 and @xmath96 components of electric and magnetic fields arranged into truncated @xmath97 and @xmath98 vectors at the interfaces @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the @xmath32th layer , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the impedance tensors of the ambient media that allow to generate @xmath104 given @xmath105 : @xmath106 , @xmath107 in the case of an isotropic dielectric layer , the evolution matrix is @xmath108 such a simple structure of operators @xmath95 and @xmath109 permits us to decompose dispersion equation ( a1 ) into two separate equations  for te and tm modes ; these are obtained via multiplying @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 or @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and applying the known representation of @xmath0th power of a @xmath116 unimodular matrix in terms of the chebychev polinomials of the second kind given by abels  @xcite .",
