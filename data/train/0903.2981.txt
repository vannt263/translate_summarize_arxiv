    "the soft x - ray diffuse backgound below 1 kev is considered to consist of the contribution of faint extragalactic sources and emissions from highly ionized ions , such as cvi , ovii , oviii , fexvii , and neix , in solar neighborhoods and in our galaxy .",
    "the extragalactic contribution , which we refer to as the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) in this paper , is estimated to be about 40 % of emission in the so - called rosat _",
    "band @xcite , which is approximately @xmath7 kev .",
    "the emission from highly ionized ions is considered to arise from at least three different origins . among them ,",
    "the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) induced emission from the heliosphere @xcite , and the thermal emission from the hot gas in local hot bubble ( lhb ) @xcite are hard to be separated from each other using emission spectra above @xmath8 kev . in this energy range ,",
    "the sum of the two emission components are approximated by a thin - thermal emission of @xmath9 kev without absorption @xcite .",
    "the remaining emission is considered to arise from more distant part of the galaxy ; mostly above or beyond the bulk of absorption in the galactic disk .",
    "@xcite called this component the `` transabsorption '' emission ( tae ) and separated it in the rosat all sky map utilizing the directional dependence of the absorption column density .",
    "they found that the emission spectrum can be described by a two - temperature thermal emission model of temperatures @xmath10 0.10 and 0.25 kev .",
    "however , because there is no constraint on distance other than absorption , it is hard to constrain the origins conclusively .",
    "new insight has been obtained from combined analyses of the absorption lines observed in the energy spectra of extragalactic objects and emission lines of the same ion species observed nearby .",
    "@xcite analyzed the absorption spectra of lmc x-3 obtained with the transmission grating ( hetg ) onboard chandra , and the emission spectra from the blank fields about 30 away from lmc x-3 observed with the ccd camera ( xis ) onboard suzaku .",
    "the joint spectral fit of the data shows the hot gas attributed to the tae component can not be isothermal . instead , a thick galactic hot gaseous disk whose temperature and density decrease exponentially from the galactic midplane can consistently explain the observations .",
    "they obtained scale heights of 1.4 and 2.8 kpc , and the midplane values of 0.31 kev and @xmath11 for the temperature and the density , respectively .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the sight line toward mrk 421 , although the the x - ray emission is mostly based on the rosat all sky survey data , thus the emission lines are not resolved spectroscopically @xcite .    in this paper , we analyze energy spectra of the soft x - ray diffuse emission of twelve different fields observed with suzaku @xcite and combine them with suzaku results of two other fields in literature . by virtue of the good energy response function of the ccd camera @xcite and the high sensitivity when combined with the x - ray mirror @xcite , we clearly detected ovii emission from all the fields , and oviii emission from most of them .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the xis1 data which has much larger effective area below 1  kev than other xis sensors because it employs backside illuminated ccd . throughout this paper , we quote single parameter errors at the 90  % confidence level unless otherwise specified .",

    "the analysis results of the seven data sets , off filament ( off - fil ) , on filament ( on - fil ) , north ecliptic pole 1 ( nep1 ) , mbm 12 off cloud ( m12off ) , lmc x-3 vicinity ( lx-3 ) , mbm 12 on cloud ( m12on ) , and midplane 235 ( mp235 ) have been already published .",
    "the data reduction done by @xcite for lx-3 is consistent with that shown in this section . since @xcite ( nep1 ) and @xcite ( m12off ) used version 0.7 processed data , we re - analyzed the data from the data reduction .",
    "the second observation of the north ecliptic pole direction ( nep2 ) was made about a half year after the first nep observation .",
    "the aim points of the two observations are identical , although the roll angle was rotated by about 180@xmath21 .",
    "the two fields at the bottom of table  [ tbl : obs_log ] , m12on and mp235 , are special directions compared to other twelve fields .",
    "m12on is towards the molecular cloud mbm12 located at @xmath22 pc with a bright cataclysmic variable in the field of view behind the cloud , and mp235 is in the galactic plane at @xmath23 with a large ( @xmath24 ) galactic absorption .",
    "they therefore require spectral models different from those of the other fields in this paper .",
    "the spectral results from these two directions have been already published @xcite and were analyzed in the same manner as used in this paper , including the geocoronal swcx removal .",
    "we therefore simply adopt their analysis , although we have updated their fits to m12on with more recent calibration data .",
    "for these two fields we will simply show the results in tables and figures and will not show the details of analysis in the text .    in all the observations ,",
    "the xis was set to the normal clocking mode and the data format was either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the spaced - raw charge injection ( sci ) was on for low latitude 86 - 21 ( ll21 ) and low latitude 97 + 10 ( ll10 ) .",
    "we used version 2.0 processed suzaku data .",
    "we first cleaned the data using the selection criteria : elevation from sunlit / dark earth rim @xmath27 20/5 deg , cut off rigidity @xmath27 8 gv . we checked the dependency of the 0.4 - 0.7 kev counting rate on the oxygen column density of the sunlit atmosphere in the line of sight using the msis atmosphere model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the counting rate was constant as a function of the column density for the cleaned data .",
    "thus there is no significant neutral o emission from earth atmosphere in the filtered data .",
    "we then constructed an x - ray image in 0.3 to 2  kev energy range .",
    "we detected point sources in the @xmath28 field of view for all the data sets except for ll10 .",
    "we removed a circular region centered at the source position from the further analysis .",
    "the radius of the circular region was determined so that the counts from the point source outside the circular region becomes less than 3 % of the diffuse x - ray emission in 0.3 to 1  kev energy range .",
    "the sum of contribution of point sources is estimated to be less than 6% of the diffuse emission for all the fields except for lh-1 and ll21 .",
    "the contributions of the two fields , lh-1 and ll21 , are respectively 8 and 12 % . for these fields",
    ", we analyzed the point source spectra and used the mirror point spread function to determine their resiual contribution in ovii and oviii .",
    "we extracted sum of point - source spectra from the circular source regions and performed model fittings .",
    "as the background spectra , we used the spectra extracted from source - free circular regions whose distances from the optical axis of the telescope are equivalent to the source regions , respectively .",
    "we estimated the upper limits of ovii and oviii emission intensities of the source regions with spectral fits , then their contamination to the sxdb spectra .",
    "the upper limit of contamination was 0.4 lu for ovii emission for the both fields .",
    "it was 0.2 lu and 0.6 lu for oviii emission for lh-1 and ll10 , respectively .",
    "for gb1428 + 4217 ( gb ) a point source of an intensity of @xmath29 @xmath30 in the energy band of 0.3 to 1 kev ( @xmath31 @xmath30 in 1 to 10 kev ) was detected at the center of the field of view .",
    "we removed a circular region of a 5 arc minute radius for this observation .",
    "the contribution of the source in the counting rate of the remaining region is estimated to be only 0.2 % .",
    "the spectrum below 1  kev could be contaminated by the swcx induced emission from the geocorona ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported a flare - like increase of x - ray flux during the suzaku observation of nep1 , which was clearly visible in the light curve of 256 s time bins .",
    "in all other observations , the increase is too small to be recognized in the light curve of 256 or 512 s time bins , but still it could be statistically significant in the x - ray spectra when they are integrated over a certain amount of time ( e.g. @xmath32 ks ) .",
    "thus as the last stage of the data reduction , we removed time intervals in which the data can be contaminated by the swcx from the geocorona .",
    "we consider two parameters which are related to suzaku s geocoronal swcx inensity .",
    "the first one is the solar wind flux near the earth .",
    "we calculated the solar - wind proton flux at the earth using ace swepam data .",
    "when the ace swepam data are not available , we used wind swe data or omni data from cdaweb ( coordinated data analysis web ) .",
    "the second parameter is the earth - center to magnetopause ( etm ) distance , where the magnetopause is defined as the lowest position along the sight line of suzaku where geomagnetic field is open to interplanetary space .",
    "the etm distance is in the range of @xmath33 to @xmath34 earth radii ( @xmath35 ) , while suzaku is in a low earth orbit of an about 650 km altitude .",
    "thus it is always looking at the sky through the magnetopause .",
    "the probability of a contamination in suzaku spectra by the swcx from the geocorona increases if the shortest earth - center to magnetopause ( etm ) distance is @xmath36 5 @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we calculated the etm distance every 256 s for all the observation periods using the t96 magnetic field model @xcite .",
    "we obtained the interplanetary plasma parameters required for the calculations from the cdaweb .    when the sun is quiet the solar wind proton flux stays in the range of @xmath37 , and shows slow ( times scales of @xmath34 ks ) time variations .",
    "on the other hand , during flaring events , it increases and can go up to @xmath38 , and shows fast ( @xmath39 ks ) time variations .    for the four observations , gb1428 + 4217 ( gb )",
    ", lockman hole 1 ( lh-1 ) , on filament ( on - fil ) and low latitude 86 - 21(ll21 ) , the proton flux was always below @xmath40 . among them , during gb and on - fil observations , the proton flux showed slow variation and the data sets can be divided into two subsets of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for gb , and of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for on - fil , respectively . both during the gb and on - fil observations , the etm distance varied in 2 to 10 @xmath35 range .",
    "we created spectra for the subsets and performed spectral fits to determine the ovii and oviii emission intensities .",
    "the fitting model used in this analysis will be described in detail in the next section ( [ subsec : det_line_intensities ] ) .",
    "we found the difference in the ovii line intensities was less than 2 @xmath44 for both fields .",
    "this corresponds to 1.7 lu and 1.3 lu for gb and on - fil , respectively . for oviii ,",
    "the difference was within 1 @xmath44 , which is 0.5 and 0.6 lu for gb and on - fil , respectively .    among all other observations , in part of hl - b , hl - b , and",
    "lh-2 observations , the proton flux stayed below @xmath40 , and showed variations of more than @xmath45 was observed .",
    "we thus also subdivided the data sets according to the proton flux .",
    "we found that the variations of ovii and oviii intensities were within 2 @xmath44 level for all those data sets .",
    "we thus conclude that when the proton flux is @xmath46 the contamination of geocoronal swcx is relataively small , although there still could remain possibility of contamination of @xmath47 lu and @xmath48 lu levels for ovii and oviii , respectively .",
    "we thus decided to use all the data for the four observations , ( gb , lh-1 , on - fil ) , and ll21 ,    for the seven observations , high latitude b ( hl - b ) , lockman hole 2 ( lh-2 ) , off filament ( off - fil ) , lmc x-3 vicinity ( lx-3 ) , north ecliptic pole ( nep1 ) , the second north ecliptic pole observation ( nep2 ) and low latitude 97 + 10 ( ll10 ) , the proton flux shows shows flare - like increase and exceeds @xmath40 in about a half of the obsevation .",
    "we thus subdivided those data into two subsets according to the proton flux , and determined the ovii and oviii intensities .",
    "we found significant ( more than @xmath49 in ovii or oviii ) difference between the two spectra for four cases : hl - b , lh-2 , nep1 and nep2 .",
    "an example of spectral comparisons is shown in figure  [ fig : hlb_compared ] .",
    "for these four data sets , we decided to use only the time intervals in which the proton flux was lower than @xmath40 .",

    "as already reported in @xcite , the etm distance became as short as @xmath50 during the lx-3 observation .",
    "however , the magnetic field was open to anti - sun direction when the etm distance was @xmath51 during which solar - wind particles can not penetrate .",
    "this explains why there was no significant difference between the high and low proton - flux spectra for this data set .",
    "we thus decided to adopt all the data for this observation . during the ll10 and off - fil observation ,",
    "the magnetic field was occasionally open to sun side when the etm distance dropped below @xmath52 .",

    "there remain two data sets , high latitude a ( hl - a ) and mbm12 off cloud ( m12off ) . during the hl - a observation , the proton flux varied in the range of @xmath53 but the time interval exceeding @xmath54 was short ( @xmath55 of data ) . during the m12off observation",
    ", it stayed at a level of @xmath56 .",
    "thus for these data sets , we can not compare spectra with low and high proton fluxes .",
    "for hl - a , we subdivided the data sets according to the etm distance and created two energy spectra with etm distances = @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "thus further subdivision was not possible , and we decided to use all the data .",
    "we tried to exclude time intervals for which contamination of time variable geocoronal swcx was significant .",
    "however we should keep it in mind that there is still uncertainty of contamination by geocoronal swcx at 1.5 lu and 0.5 lu levels for ovii and oviii , respectively .",
    "in addition , the last data set , m12off , could have larger contamination . in table",
    "[ tbl : geocorona_log ] , we summarize the process we applied to remove time intervals which are suspected to be contaminated by the swcx from the geocorona",
    ". we also show the process for m12on and mp235 fields in the table .",
    "the non x - ray background ( nxb ) spectrum was constructed from the dark earth database using the standard method in which the cut off rigidity distributions of the on - source and the background data were made identical @xcite .",
    "we found 5 to 10 % discrepancies in the counting rates above 10  kev between the nxb and the observation data , suggesting background uncertainty of this level .",
    "we also analyzed front - iluminated ccd data ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 .",
    "but xis2 was not available after november 9 , 2006 ) to determine the intensity of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) above 2 kev for each sensors .",
    "we determined the cxb intensity by the spectral fits .",
    "the model function will be described in section [ sec : analysis_results ] .",
    "the intensities determined by different sensors were consistent with each other within the 90% statistical errors for all observations except for nep2 .",
    "for this observation , the intensity from xis1 were not consistent with those from other three sensors .",
    "it was necessary to adjust the nxb level by about 30% for xis1 to obtain consistent result .",
    "this suggests that not only the nxb level but also its spectral shape may vary from the one extracted from the standard nxb data base . the cxb intensity of nep2 after the nxb correction was consistent with the cxb intensity estimated from nep1 data . since in the energy range below 1  kev , the non x - ray background is only about 10 % of the diffuse x - ray background , the spectral parameters derived in section [ sec : analysis_results ] are not sensitive to this level of background uncertainty .    in suzaku nxb non - subracted energy spectra , there are three instrumental lines at 1.486 , 1.740 , and 2.123 kev @xcite .",
    "since the line intensity and the line spread function of the detector vary with time , the residuals of those lines appears in the nxb subtracted spectra as lines or line - like structures in the 1.3 to 2.1 kev range . in order to study those features in our spectra , we first fitted all the nxb subtracted spectra in the energy range 1.1 to 5  kev .",
    "we employed a power - law function absorbed with a galactic absorption for the continuum and narrow gaussian functions for the nxb lines .",

    ", we include these gaussian functions with the parameters fixed at the best fit values for these two data sets .",
    "the results of the further analysis do not depend on inclusion or non - inclusion of these lines in the models of spectral fits .      in order to perform spectral fitting",
    ", we generated an efficiency file ( arf file ) for a spatially uniform emission , using the xissimarfgen software version 2008 - 04 - 05 @xcite , assuming a 20@xmath62-radius flat field as the input emission of the generator .",
    "a pulse height re - distribution matrix ( rmf file ) was created by the script xisrmfgen version 2007 - 05 - 14 .",
    "the calibration files , ae_xi1_quanteff_20070402.fits , ae_xi1_rmfparam_20080311.fits , ae_xi1_makepi_20080131.fits , and ae_xi1_contami_20071224.fits were used to generate the arf and rmf files .      the degradation of low energy efficiency due to the contamination on the xis optical blocking filter was included in the arf file .",
    "the gradient of the contaminant thickness over the optical blocking filter is also taken into account .",
    "systematic errors in the contaminant thickness are estimated to be about 10 % ( the suzaku technical description , see also @xcite for early data and @xcite for recent data ) .",
    "we performed all the analysis described in the next section not only for the nominal contaminant thicknesses but also assuming 10% thicker and thinner contaminants .",
    "because the contaminant thickness is gradually increasing with time , we created the arf files of 10% thicker or thiner contaminants by shifting the observation dates from the real dates , except for the 10 % thicker cases of ll21 and ll10 .",
    "for the two cases , the + 10 % thickness is larger than that of the most recent date in the latest calibration database .",
    "we thus added an absorption model in the model spectra to represent the extra contamination .",

    "in fact both the total mass and the total thermal energy of the hot plasma can be supplied at a supernova rate of @xmath177 within the radiative cooling time of 3 gy . however , there is no particular reason why the gas should prefer @xmath178 kev .",
    "the spectra of the halo emission of nearby star - forming galaxies and of some of normal galaxies are described by two - temperature models with @xmath179 s in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 kev @xcite .",

    "then it is likely related to the virial temperature ( @xmath178 kev ) for the rotation velocity of 200 km  s@xmath180 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this coincidence is that the hot gas was formed by cosmological accretion @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity of our galaxy estimated above is consistent with the simulations .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time of the hot gas is 3gy , and the hot gas needs be supplied at least on this time scale .",
    "another interpretation is also possible that higher temperature gas has escaped from the potential and that the gas at the temperature near the virial temperature remains , since the escape time scale is by a factor of five shorter than the radiative cooling time scale .",
    "from the spectral fits with model 2 , we obtained 2 to 3 solar for [ ne / o ] and [ fe / o ] abundance ratios for four of the spectra .",
    "however , in model 3 ( table  [ tbl : specfit_taefix_bknpow ] ) , we showed that these fe - l and ne `` excess '' emission can be explained by a higher temperature components of @xmath181 kev .",
    "the hl - b field shows a high o emission temperature ( 0.30 kev , see figure  [ fig : oviii - ovii_bkn ] and table  [ tbl : specfit_fix_bknpow ] ) .",
    "since all these fields are in high ecliptic latitudes , where only low - ionization - temperature winds are emitted from the sun during solar minimum , the heliospheric swcx is not likely origin of the excess ne and fe emission .",
    "these lines of sight may contain blobs of high ( @xmath182 kev ) temperature hot gas which may be on the way to escape from our galaxy .",
    "( 0.8 , ) fig8.eps    we obtained significantly higher temperature ( 0.75 kev ) for the tae component for low latitude 97 + 10 ( ll10 ) than that of other samples ( average = 0.2 kev ) .",
    "this direction has a high galactic absorption of @xmath184 , and the transmissions for ovii and oviii are respectively only about 10 and 20 % .",
    "thus the emission from the thick disk of temperature @xmath185 kev will be significantly absorbed and hard to detect , if it exists in this direction .",
    "@xcite detected an emission component of the similar temperature in the energy spectrum of the midplane direction , mp235 .",
    "they suggested that the component is a sum of emission from unresolved faint dm stars existing between the bulk of galactic absorption and the earth , and constructed model spectra assuming an average dm star spectrum with two - temperature thermal emission , the stellar x - ray luminosity distribution functions , and the spatial densities of dm stars in the literature .",
    "the model spectrum could consistently explain the observed spectrum not only in spectral shape but also in absolute intensity within 30 % .",
    "we fitted the ll10 spectrum using their dm star model spectrum constructed for @xmath186 , instead of the tae component in model 1 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : b10_dmstar ] , this model reproduces the observed spectrum well ( @xmath65 = 89.2 for 90 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , it was necessary to increase the intensity of the emission by a factor of about 5 from the model .",
    "this suggests that the emission from dm stars does not decrease so rapidly with increasing @xmath187 as the model predicts , or that the there are large spatial fluctuations at @xmath188 .",
    "we need more observations at low galactic latitude in order to solve this problem .",
    "we presented spectra of soft diffuse x - ray emission in twelve fields observed with suzaku together with the spectra of two other fields analyzed by @xcite . in the data reduction",
    ", we carefully removed the contributions of the solar - wind charge - exchange ( swcx ) induced x - ray emission from the geocorona .",
    "however , @xmath47 lu uncertainty remains in ovii intensity .",
    "the discrepancy between the two nep observations ( 1.9 lu ) can be partly due to yet incomplete removal of geocoronal swcx .    to determine o emission intensities , we first fitted the spectra with a model consisting of a broken power - law component for the cxb , and two thin thermal emission components of the solar abundance , one of which are subject to galactic absorption ( model 1 ) .",
    "the ovii and oviii emission intensities were determined using the model by setting o abundances of two thermal emission components to zero and adding two gaussian functions to represent ovii and oviii .",
    "the ovii and oviii intensities are strongly correlated and suggest the existence of an intensity floor for ovii emission at @xmath189 ( lu ) .",
    "the oviii emission intensity of nine high - latitude fields show a tight correlation with the excess of the ovii intensity above the floor .",
    "the relation is approximated as ( ovii intensity ) = 0.5  @xmath4  [ ( ovii intensity )    2  lu ) ] .",
    "these suggest that the ovii emission arises from two origins : approximately uniform emission of about 2 lu , and spatially variable ( 0 - 7 lu ) emission from hot plasma of a temperature of @xmath5 2 kev .",
    "the former is likely to arise from heliospheric solar wind charge exchange plus the local hot bubble ( swcx+lhb ) , and the latter from hot gas in more distant parts of the galaxy , i.e. the transabsorption emission ( tae ) .",
    "it is remarkable that for most of the fields , tae average emission temperatures are confined in a narrow range ( @xmath190 kev ) around 0.2 kev .",
    "this temperature may be related to the virial temperature of the galaxy , which locally corresponds to the rotation velocity of @xmath191  km  s@xmath180 .",
    "the o emission intensities of the two thermal components of model 1 do not reproduce the above characteristics of o emission .",
    "this is because the abundance is fixed to the solar , while strong ne and fe - l emissions exist in some of the spectra .",
    "the observed spectra can be fitted with a model in which the intensity and temperature of the non - absorbed swcx+lhb component are fixed to nominal values if we set the ne and fe abundances of absorbed tae component free ( model 2 ) , or if we include an additional higher temperature component ( model 3 ) .",
    "we found that four spectra required ne to o abundances as large as 3 solar with model 2 .",
    "alternatively , these spectra can be fitted by model 3 with a higher temperature ( 0.5 - 0.9 kev ) emission component with solar abundances .",
    "the temperatures of the tae component obtained with these two models were consistent with the values expected from the ovii to oviii ratio .",
    "the surface brightnesses estimated from the present best - fit model function were statistically consistent with the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) map , even though the present observations were performed during solar minimum , while the rass was in solar maximum .",
    "the upper limit for the difference was estimated to be @xmath2 _ r45_-band counting rate after corrected for the difference in point source removal threshold between the present suzaku observations and the rass .",
    "the origin of the tae component was discussed in the context of the thick hot disk constructed by @xcite .",
    "the emission measure determined by model 2 shows a large deviation from the @xmath192 dependence expected from a plane parallel configuration , which we consider to suggest short spatial scale structure of the hot gas .",
    "the total luminosity , midplane density , and the total mass of the hot gas were estimated assuming simple cylindrical geometry and a uniform temperature .",
    "the canonical temperature of the tae component , @xmath193 kev , may be related to the virial temperature of our galaxy .",
    "the lowest latitude sample of the present analysis , @xmath194 , contains emission with @xmath179 = 0.75 kev instead of 0.2 kev .",
    "the spectral shape of this component can be represented by the faint dm star model by @xcite .",
