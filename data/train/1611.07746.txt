    "at high radio frequencies ( @xmath10ghz ) the bright ( @xmath11mjy ) extragalactic radio population is dominated by blazars ( bl lacs and flat - spectrum radio quasars , fsrqs ) , interpreted as sources whose relativistic jets are directed very close to the line - of - sight ( see , e.g. , blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "the jets are collimated by intense magnetic fields .",
    "the blazar radio emission is synchrotron radiation from a series of blobs along the jet .",
    "the observed flux densities are blue - shifted and greatly boosted by relativistic effects .    in this scenario ,",
    "the flat radio spectra are interpreted as the combination of components self - absorbed up to different frequencies .",
    "the spectra steepen when the emission becomes optically thin .",
    "young and compact objects are characterised by spectra peaking at high frequencies while older sources are more extended and have spectra steepening at lower frequencies .",
    "occasionally the spectra may be dominated by a single flaring blob .",
    "measurements of polarimetric properties of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at centimetric and millimetric wavelengths carry information on magnetic fields and on the plasma in the inner , unresolved regions of their relativistic jets .    even if synchrotron radiation can be up to @xmath12 polarized , the polarization degree of extragalactic sources is rarely observed to be higher than @xmath13 ; the median values are @xmath14 at @xmath3ghz ( massardi et al .",
    "this is the result of several depolarisation effects .",
    "the measured polarised flux is an average of the emission from sub - structures with different orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "further depolarisation may be due to differential faraday rotation that may be amplified by its frequency dependence within the bandwidth .",
    "as a consequence , polarimetric observations generally require high sensitivities and a detailed knowledge of instrumental properties to perform accurate calibration ( see massardi et al .",
    "2016a ) , a delicate procedure at high frequencies .",
    "for these reasons polarimetric surveys of large source samples at @xmath15ghz have become possible only recently thanks to the advent of large bandwidth instruments ( see galluzzi et al .",
    "2016 for an up - to - date summary of the available observations ) .    to set the stage we give here an overview of the main high frequency polarisation surveys in the table [ tab : polcom ] , reporting the detection rates and median polarisation fractions found at the frequency @xmath16ghz .",

    "2002 ; tucci et al . 2004",
    "; taylor et al .",
    "2007 ; grant et al . 2010 ; subrahmanyan et al .",
    "these results were however challenged by hales et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .    on the whole ,",
    "our understanding of the high radio frequency polarisation properties of extragalactic sources is still limited .",
    "this has motivated the new high - sensitivity ( @xmath0mjy , a factor @xmath18 better than the at20 g sensitivity ) and nearly simultaneous , multi - frequency polarimetric observations over a wide spectral range ( @xmath1ghz ) whose results are reported here .",
    "we observed with the atca the _",
    "planck_-atca coeval observations ( paco ) `` faint sample '' ( massardi et al .",
    "2016b ) , a complete sample of at20 g sources with @xmath19mjy .",
    "the instrumental capabilities were exploited to reconstruct the polarimetric spectral profile to unprecedented detail .",
    "high frequency observations are easily affected by spectral , detection and variability - related biases . the present work , owing to the completeness of the sample , the high sensitivity and the close - in - time multi - frequency characterisation , allows us to minimise all these effects .",
    "thus , we provide a new statistical assessment of the polarimetric properties of high frequency extragalactic radio sources , analysing and describing their spectral and polarisation behaviour with frequency .",
    "moreover , exploiting also the at20 g and paco observations in total intensity , we investigate the source variability for @xmath8 and @xmath20yr time lags at several frequencies up to @xmath21ghz .",
    "multi - frequency and multi - epoch polarimetric observations of radio sources are useful cosmological tools for several reasons .",
    "radio sources are the most relevant foreground contaminants of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarisation maps ( on scales of up to @xmath22arcmin ) in the relatively clean @xmath23ghz frequency range ( massardi et al .",
    "a proper characterisation of the radio source contribution to the power spectrum in polarisation is essential for a precise assessment of the lensing b - mode signal ( hanson et al .",
    "2013 , polarbear : ade et al .",
    "this , in turn , is essential for the detection and the characterisation of the power spectrum of the primordial b - modes associated with the stochastic background of gravitational waves , the most ambitious goal of current and future cmb projects ( prism collaboration 2014 ) . because of the broad variety of polarized emission spectra , extrapolations from low frequencies ( @xmath24ghz ) are inadequate to model the radio source contribution in cmb polarisation maps ( huffenberger et al .",
    ".    at the same time , radio sources are the privileged calibrators both of the polarized intensity and of the polarisation angle for cmb experiments .",
    "the systematic errors due to inaccuracies in the calibration of the polarisation angle are becoming the limiting factor for cmb polarization experiments ( e.g. kaufman et al .",
    "unfortunately , the number of compact , bright , highly polarised and stable enough extragalactic sources , suitable for accurately calibrating cmb polarization maps are rare .",
    "one of the purposes of our polarisation survey was to identify good candidates .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ obs ]",
    "we briefly present the paco project , its main results and the polarimetric observations of the selected sub - sample held in september 2014 with atca . in section",
    "[ sec : maths ] we describe the data reduction . in section [ dataanaly ]",
    "we discuss the data analysis and the spectral behaviours in total intensity and polarisation . in section [ variability ]",
    "we address the variability properties for our sample .",
    "finally , in section [ discusseconcl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the paco project yielded observations of @xmath25 at20 g sources in @xmath26 epochs between july 2009 and august 2010 in the @xmath27ghz frequency range with atca , nearly simultaneously ( within @xmath28 days ) with the _ planck _ observations ( massardi et al . 2016b ) .",
    "the main goal of the project was to characterize , in combination with _",
    "data , the total intensity spectra and their variability over a wide frequency range ( at least from @xmath29ghz to @xmath30ghz , but up to @xmath31ghz for some sources ) .",
    "a multi - frequency observing run was dedicated to polarimetry in september 2014 with atca .",
    "the sample was extracted from the `` faint '' paco sample ( @xmath32mjy ) selecting sources in the southern ecliptic pole region ( ecliptic latitude @xmath33 ) , where the satellite scanning strategy implies a better sensitivity .",
    "the @xmath34 extended sources in the sample ( i.e. sources larger than the paco resolution of @xmath35arcsec ) were left out as the techniques to extract flux densities used in the paco project underestimate their flux densities . the final complete sample comprises @xmath36 compact sources with @xmath32mjy in the at20 g catalogue .    the spectral setup consisted in @xmath37 sets of @xmath38ghz cabb ( compact array broadband backend ) bands centred at @xmath39ghz , @xmath40ghz and @xmath41ghz , similar to those for the paco program .",
    "a total of @xmath42hr were allocated in three slots of @xmath43hr each ( including overheads and calibration ) dedicated to each of the three bands over a period of least three days .",
    "each object was observed for @xmath44min in two @xmath45min scans at different hour angles for each frequency .",
    "weather conditions were very good during all the campaign .",
    "the array configuration was h214 , a hybrid ( antenna are displayed also along the n - s direction ) compact array with a nominal spatial resolution ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath29arcsec in the @xmath1ghz interval if we consider only the @xmath34 most packed antennas .",
    "the resolution goes down to @xmath47arcsec considering also the longest baselines with the sixth antenna , but with a lower sensitivity . adopting a hybrid configuration results in a more homogeneous @xmath48-plane coverage of the largest spatial scales in less time .",
    "this results in a better imaging with respect to a non - hybrid solution , at least for our sample of mostly point - like objects .",
    "the data reduction was done using the miriad software package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) treating each frequency separately , as indicated in the atca user s guide . while loading the data , we corrected for the time - dependent instrumental xy - phase variation , exploiting the known signal injected from a noise diode mounted in one of the feeds of each antenna .",
    "the reference flux density calibrator ( at all frequencies ) was the source pks1934 - 638 , a bright ( point - like ) gigahertz peaked - spectrum ( gps ) radio galaxy , stable , unpolarised ( at least below @xmath49ghz ) , whose model ( see reynolds 1994 ; sault 2003 ; partridge et al .",
    "2016 ) is encoded into miriad itself .",
    "it is the only known source with all these characteristics in the southern sky .",
    "once the calibration tables were derived , all solutions were ingested in the code for flux density extraction .",
    "to better characterize the source spectra , we decided to split each @xmath50ghz - wide frequency band in sub - bands .",
    "each of them was calibrated separately . for total intensity",
    "we split each band into @xmath51mhz - wide sub - bands , as done in the past analyses for the paco project . for polarised flux densities we split bands in only @xmath52 sub - bands to limit the @xmath53 degradation in sensitivity .",
    "flux densities were estimated via the miriad task uvflux .",
    "our sources are known to exhibit linear polarisation ( up to @xmath13 , massardi et al .",
    "2008 , 2013 ) , defined by the @xmath54 and @xmath55 stokes parameters .",
    "observations of the circular polarisation of extragalactic radio sources have demonstrated that it is very low , generally below @xmath56 , at least one order of magnitude lower than the linear polarisation ( rayner et al . 2000 ) , hence generally undetectable for our sources , given the @xmath57mjy sensitivity .",
    "hence , the rms @xmath58 ( of the retrieved @xmath59 stokes parameter ) is used as a noise estimator of the total intensity flux density @xmath60 . the polarised emission , @xmath61 , is given by the simple relation : @xmath62 where the @xmath63 term removes the noise bias on @xmath61 under the assumption of equal noise values , @xmath64 , for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 parameters ( e.g. wardle & kronberg 1974 ) .",
    "the polarisation angle @xmath65 and fraction @xmath66 ( usually in terms of a percentage ) are :    @xmath67      assuming gaussian noise , the error scales as @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the number of correlations at a given @xmath70 .",
    "a suitable estimate of the total intensity error is the sum in quadrature of @xmath58 with a systematic term , mainly accounting for the calibration uncertainty .",
    "based on the past experience with paco observations and on a comparison between flux densities obtained from different calibrators , the calibration error amounts to @xmath14 of the @xmath60 flux density , giving for @xmath71 , the global error on i : @xmath72 the error , @xmath73 , on the polarised flux density , @xmath61 , can be derived from the eq .",
    "( [ equ : polfluden ] ) .",
    "a conservative @xmath13 error in the polarisation calibration is adopted in this case .",
    "then , we have : @xmath74 @xmath75 being the rms errors on the stokes parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "this estimate of the calibration error is consistent with the differences between flux densities obtained using two different calibrators for reducing our data .    from error propagation",
    ", the global error on the polarisation fraction is : @xmath76 and that on @xmath65 is : @xmath77 where , again , the calibration error on the polarisation angle , @xmath78 , is added in quadrature . under the hypothesis that the calibration error affects equally the @xmath54 and @xmath55 parameters ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 gives @xmath81 .",
    "finally : @xmath82 implying @xmath83 . this estimation turns out to be consistent with differences in the polarisation angle obtained by using different calibrators .      to check our assumption of target compactness at all frequencies and the flux density extraction we created maps for each stokes parameter by means of the standard miriad procedure",
    ". we adopted the natural weighting , the standard for point sources , to ensure the lowest noise level .",
    "we used multi - frequency synthesis imaging and a standard hgbom algorithm .",
    "the detection threshold was set at @xmath5 in both @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath84 was derived from the @xmath60 image region with no emission .",
    "we use the task uvflux for flux density measurements ( except for a few cases described below ) .",
    "this task is designed for point - like sources and works directly on visibilities , minimizing artifacts and phase - instabilities which may affect more image - based measurements . since our sample",
    "excludes extended sources ( at least up to @xmath3ghz ) , we expect that flux densities provided by uvflux and by imstat ( the miriad task for flux density estimation from imaging ) show differences no greater than @xmath85 in total intensity ( due to residual phase instabilities in the images ) .",
    "moreover , we assumed a source pointing accurate enough to keep objects in the phase center of the @xmath48-plane .",
    "the latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that the paco catalogue is drawn from the at20 g one , for which all positions are known with an accuracy @xmath86arcsec ( murphy et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "afterwards , we compared the imstat image peak ( in mjy / beam ) and the uvflux flux density estimation ( for all the objects for which the uv - coverage allows imaging , i.e. @xmath87 of the cases ) to reveal , in both i and p , whether an extended or displaced ( from the phase centre ) component is present .",
    "the median discrepancies , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively . in total intensity",
    "the relative discrepancy is @xmath92 for @xmath93 of the images .",
    "these large discrepancies are registered for frequencies @xmath94ghz ; they reach maximum values between @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath52 objects ( at20gj080633 - 711217 and at20gj080649 - 610131 , respectively ) at @xmath21ghz . in all the cases the image peak values are higher than the uvflux estimation .",
    "a visual inspection of the images confirms that the sources are barely resolved .    in polarisation",
    "the fractional discrepancy is @xmath97 in @xmath98 of the available images and @xmath99 in @xmath100 of the cases . in particular , there is one object , at20gj040848 - 750720 , for which the excess of flux density ( with respect to uvflux ) measured in correspondence of the peak in the image reaches @xmath101 at @xmath102ghz and @xmath103 at @xmath21ghz .",
    "we show images for this source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : j0408 ] ) at all the @xmath34 frequencies at which they could be obtained in total intensity .",
    "polarised emissions are instead displayed by contour levels .",
    "it can be seen that the object is marginally resolved at the lower frequencies . at the higher frequencies a second component appears and the polarised emission mainly comes from it . according to morganti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) at20gj0408 - 7507 is a bright frii radio galaxy at @xmath104 , dominated by two bright lobes .",
    "both lobes have high depolarization , slightly higher in the eastern one .    given the good matching between flux densities from imaging and from visibilities for point - like objects ( both in total intensity and in polarisation ) , we decided to integrate over a suitable region on @xmath60 images to recover the total intensity flux densities in case of slightly resolved objects . in case of the flux discrepancies in polarisation ,",
    "since images reveal an emerging point - like component displaced from the phase center , we estimated the flux density by considering the peak of the @xmath61 image .    the complete catalogue ( flux densities and fitting parameters , polarisation fractions and angles ) for the observations discussed in the present paper is available online , as supplementary material .    ,",
