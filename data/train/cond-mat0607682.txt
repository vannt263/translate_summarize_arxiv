    "thermal conductivity measurements at low temperatures @xmath2 in the superconducting state have played an important role in strengthening the case for a @xmath1-wave bcs - like description of quasiparticles in optimally doped cuprate superconductors .",
    "they are bulk probes of the superconducting state , unlike arpes and stm , and can currently be performed at lower @xmath2 than microwave experiments .",
    "one drawback is the need to separate phonon and electron contributions , but in the cuprate superconductors an asymptotic linear term , @xmath3 which can be attributed solely to quasiparticles is almost always present at the lowest temperatures .",
    "after theoretical predictions of the universality of low-@xmath2 quasiparticle transport in nodal superconductors@xcite , experimental confirmation was obtained in a number of optimally doped materials@xcite . according to the theory , which relies on the disorder - averaged self - consistent @xmath2-matrix approximation ( sctma ) , the low-@xmath2 thermal conductivity is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gap slope at the node , and @xmath6 the fermi velocity .",
    "this result has been shown to be insensitive to vertex corrections due to anisotropic scattering@xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 is generally well - known , eq.([eq1 ] ) has been used to extract the gap slope for a number of cuprates at lower doping as well@xcite , leading to the conclusion that @xmath5 increases with underdoping@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is in apparent contradiction to recent arpes experiments@xcite , so it is worthwhile to examine physical effects outside the framework of the sctma which could lead to a suppression of @xmath0 and thereby to the possible erroneous conclusion based on eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that @xmath5 was increasing .",
    "there are several effects known to lead to a suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "localization effects were discussed in this context in ref .",
    "@xcite , and effects of bulk subdominant competing orders have been shown to suppress @xmath0 but do not immediately eliminate it , despite the removal of the @xmath1-wave nodes@xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the effects on @xmath7 by local impurity - induced moments relevant e.g. to the underdoped regime of la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( lsco)@xcite .",
    "the model used to study disordered @xmath1-wave superconductors with magnetic correlations is : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 creates an electron of spin @xmath13 on the site @xmath14 on a two - dimensional lattice , @xmath15 is the chemical potential and @xmath16 is the particle number operator . in general ,",
    "magnetic order induced by @xmath17 will compete with the superconducting order @xmath18 and lead to a bulk magnetic state above some critical @xmath19 .",
    "however , even for @xmath20 , disorder @xmath21 caused by point - like impurities can induce localized @xmath22 states with staggered magnetization . here , @xmath23 is the critical @xmath17 necessary for local moment formation , and will in general depend on the impurity strength . in this paper we study impurity configurations with 2% randomly positioned point - like impurities of strength @xmath24 which is in the unitary limit .",
    "we have solved eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) selfconsistently on @xmath25 lattices with hole doping @xmath26 , and calculated the electronic @xmath7 as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ kappafig ] , we show the thermal conductivity averaged over 20 different random impurity configurations . for @xmath27",
    "the results agree well with those obtained previously for the dilute impurity limit@xcite : @xmath28 , and the spatial inhomogeneity of @xmath18 only slightly modifies @xmath29 as seen by comparing the sc and nsc results . for the bulk system we have @xmath30 on each link resulting in the universal value @xmath31 , which is nicely reproduced by the numerics . for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath17 enters as a chemical potential shift which is compensated by a modified @xmath15 ( to get @xmath34 ) and consequently @xmath7 is identical to the @xmath27 result . in the regime @xmath20 ,",
    "local moments are formed and the corresponding thermal conductivity is also shown in fig . [ kappafig ] .",
    "as seen , when @xmath17 increases , @xmath35 ( and @xmath0 ) is continuously suppressed , and @xmath0 will eventually vanish in the bulk insulating state around @xmath36 . the origin of the suppressed thermal conductivity can be traced to a reduction of the low - energy density of states ( dos ) by the local magnetic moments as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ kappafig ] .",
    "thus , impurity - driven local moment formation in the underdoped regime may explain the doping dependence of @xmath0 measured in lsco@xcite .",
    "in addition , since the low-@xmath2 thermal conductivity is severely suppressed , measured values of @xmath37 and a naive use of the `` universal '' clean @xmath1-wave result in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) would lead to an erroneous estimate the superconducting gap .     versus @xmath2 for @xmath38 point - like impurities with @xmath27 ( non - selfconsistent ( nsc ) ( @xmath39 ) , selfconsistent ( sc ) ( @xmath40 ) ) , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
