    "for many years cosmic flows have been a promising way to probe mass density fluctuations on intermediate scales ( @xmath31  mpc ) and to obtain dynamical measures of the cosmological parameters .",
    "unfortunately , compiling peculiar velocity data with the desired sky coverage and full sampling is time - consuming , so most previous cosmic flow studies have been based on sparse or non - uniform catalogs , leading to conflicting interpretations .",
    "recently , new large redshift - distance surveys of spiral ( sfi ; da costa 1996 , haynes 1999a , 1999b ) and early - type galaxies ( enear ; da costa 2000a , hereafter paper  i ; wegner 2002 ; alonso 2002 ) have been completed and some of the unresolved issues are being re - addressed with these significantly larger and more uniform samples .    the enear catalog of peculiar velocities described in paper i is an all - sky catalog which includes a magnitude - limited sample of early - type galaxies ( enearm ) extracted from completed magnitude - limited redshift surveys , as well as a subsample of cluster galaxies which are fainter than the magnitude limit of the parent redshift surveys . the enear catalog is a compilation of observational parameters for @xmath4 early - type galaxies .",
    "it includes new photometric and spectroscopic data for @xmath5 early - type galaxies in clusters and in the field as well as data from previous work .",
    "our new photometric and spectroscopic measurements are presented in alonso et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and wegner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "data from this catalog have already been used in some previous analyses presented in other papers of this series ( bernardi 1998 ; borgani 2000 ; da costa 2000b ; nusser 2001 ; zaroubi 2001 ) .    in conducting these analyses",
    "we have found it necessary operationally to split the enear catalog into two samples , enearm and enearc ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the enearc is composed of galaxies from enearm that are in clusters , but with the addition of galaxies fainter than the original enearm magnitude limit using new observations and data in the literature .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to focus on the enearc cluster subsample ; here we describe the assignment of galaxies to clusters , the homogenization of our new data with those of previous work , and report the final combined photometric and spectroscopic parameters of the cluster galaxies .",
    "the construction of the enearc catalog is needed in order to obtain an accurate template scaling relation ( the @xmath0 relation ) which can be use to measure distances and peculiar velocities for all the early - type galaxies in the enear catalog .",
    "the @xmath0 scaling relation , originally introduced by dressler ( 1987 ) , is essentially equivalent to the more general fundamental plane ( fp , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) defined by early - type galaxies .",
    "the underlying assumption in estimating distances is that these scaling relations are the same for field and cluster galaxies",
    ". for galaxies which are at approximately the same redshift , so effects of evolution can be neglected , the dependence of these scaling relations on cluster properties has been investigated by several authors ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1996 ; donofrio 1997 ; pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1998 ; scodeggio 1998 ; gibbons , fruchter , & bothun 2001 ; colless 2001 ) .",
    "( for how the fp depends on cluster redshift see jrgensen 1999 ; treu 1999 , 2001 ; van dokkum 2001 . )",
    "other issues that bear on the results are the assignment of galaxies to clusters , the small number of observed galaxies per cluster , which requires the use of all available cluster data for the definition of a template distance relation , and the possible biases of the parameters resulting from selection effects and measurement errors .",
    "the data presented in this paper are used in bernardi ( 2002 ) to derive the template - distance relation from which the galaxy distances and the peculiar velocity field of the enear sample were derived .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  2 we describe the selection of clusters and the criteria used for membership assignment . in section  3",
    "we present the new spectroscopic and photometric data and discuss the corrections applied to our measurements and to those of other authors which bring the available data into a common system .",
    "section  4 , contains the final merged and standardized enearc catalog of early - type cluster galaxies used to construct the distance relation and peculiar velocity analyses .",
    "a brief summary is given in section  5 .",
    "a key requirement for constructing any distance relation based on cluster / group galaxies is to have a well defined procedure for identifying bound systems and assigning galaxies to them . with currently available optical , all - sky redshift surveys ( huchra 1983 , cfa1 ; falco 1999 , cfa2 ; da costa 1988 , ssrs ; da costa 1998 , ssrs2 ; santiago 1995 , ors ) a significant improvement can be made on earlier work which justifies reexamining galaxy assignments to clusters .    in this paper",
    "we have adopted the following procedure : clusters within @xmath6 kms@xmath7 were selected from group catalogs derived by applying the objective group - finding algorithm of huchra & geller ( 1982 ) to all complete , magnitude - limited redshift surveys currently available . for most of the sky ( @xmath8 steradians ) rich groups ( @xmath9 15 members )",
    "were drawn from the cfa1 ( geller & huchra 1983 ) and ssrs ( maia , da costa & latham 1989 ) catalogs . at low galactic latitudes",
    "the catalogs were complemented by groups identified in the optical redshift survey ( santiago 1995 ) . over the fraction of the sky surveyed by the cfa2 and ssrs2 ( @xmath10 steradians , including more than a third of both galactic caps ) , we used groups identified by ramella , pisani , & geller ( 1997 ) in the cfa2 and ramella ( 2002 ) in the ssrs2 , instead of those identified in earlier shallower surveys .",
    "this selection is not uniform over the sky because of the different magnitude - limits and density contrast thresholds that had to be adopted in the group identification .",
    "an attempt to minimize this effect and include possible fainter members is discussed in section  [ member ] .",
    "the final catalog contains 32 rich ( @xmath11 members ) , 318 medium - size ( 5 - 15 members ) and 628 small ( @xmath12 members ) systems making a total of 978 groups . for each group",
    "the combined catalog provides : the number of members ; center coordinates , heliocentric radial velocity , velocity dispersion , and the physical size expressed by the pair radius @xmath13 ( ramella , geller , & huchra 1989 ) which is used below to establish cluster membership .",
    "the physical parameters of the groups are computed considering all morphological types .",
    "groups with at least 15 members were cross - identified with the abell and the aco cluster catalogs ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ) .",
    "all but three , consisting predominantly of spirals were known clusters . because of",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the parent redshift surveys some faint early - type galaxies , known to be in clusters , are missed by this procedure .",
    "fainter early - types with data in the literature were added to our compilation ( see section  [ member ] ) .    to this list we added five additional well - studied clusters : a539 , as639 , and a3381 ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1995a , 1995b ) and 7s21 and a347 ( smith 1997 ) .",
    "these clusters were excluded from our original list because they are either located at low galactic latitudes , outside the regions probed by the redshift surveys , or because the member galaxies are fainter than the limiting magnitude of these redshift surveys .",
    "a special procedure was also adopted to handle the centaurus cluster , which has two distinct components ( lucey & carter 1988 ) but is identified as a single large system in the group catalog . in this case , we assigned memberships based on the observed redshift distribution along the line - of - sight .",
    "the resulting list of members for each system agrees well with lucey & carter ( 1988 ) .",
    "the physical characteristics of these two groups , hereafter cen30 and cen45 , were computed after splitting the systems ( see section  [ prop ] ) .    from the cluster / group sample above we selected 58 groups containing a minimum of five early - type galaxies and at least 15 members of any morphological type , to provide a reliable cluster velocity dispersion estimate . figure  [ fig : cludistr ] shows the projected distribution in galactic coordinates of all the 58 selected clusters , including the 28 clusters considered in the present paper .",
    "the apparent deficiency of clusters at low galactic latitudes may not be real .",
    "however the apparent underdensity of galaxies shown on the left side of the plot at higher galactic latitudes can also be seen in figure 14 of paper  i , which shows this for the enear and sfi galaxies .",
    "we ultimately focused on creating a large database of measurements in common with other authors , and to enlarge the sample of available galaxies in the 28 previously studied clusters .",
    "it is useful to refer to figure  4 of paper  i , which compares the distribution of clusters on the sky with that of the underlying galaxies .",
    "four clusters lie inside the perseus - pisces ( pp ) region ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; smith et al .",
    "the two dominant concentrations of galaxies , the great attractor ( ga ) and perseus - pisces superclusters , are indicated in that figure .",
    "paper i also shows that in our sample , the ga and pp superclusters produce a prominent peak at @xmath16 kms@xmath7 in the redshift distribution of the clusters , indicating that our clusters probe the most prominent structures in the nearby universe .",
    "the main physical characteristics of the 28 selected clusters are given in table [ tab : clusters ] : the cluster name in column ( 1 ) ; columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the right ascension and declination , as determined from the group finding algorithm or taken from the references listed in column 9 ; column ( 4 ) is the heliocentric radial velocity ; column ( 5 ) the cluster velocity dispersion ; column ( 6 ) the value of the radius @xmath13 , whenever available ( see section  [ member ] ) ; column ( 7 ) the number of early - type galaxies with distances in this paper ; column ( 8) indicates clusters using only measurements obtained by other authors ; and column ( 9 ) references previous studies of these clusters . note that the cluster global parameters such as redshift , velocity dispersion , and size were taken from the merged group catalog described earlier .",
    "comparing these redshifts with those obtained using only the cluster early - types , we find insignificant differences , the mean offset being @xmath17 kms@xmath7 and the scatter @xmath18 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the cluster velocity dispersions listed in the table also agree well , with a mean difference of @xmath19 kms@xmath7 and a scatter of @xmath20 kms@xmath7 . in the latter case , we find that for rich clusters , the values listed in the table are smaller with an offset of @xmath21 kms@xmath7",
    ".    poor sampling of the cluster region affects both the estimated cluster velocity dispersion and the characteristic size scale @xmath13 . in some cases",
    "the coordinates of the groups / clusters had to be revised because closer inspection showed that the group catalog was unable to separate neighboring clusters ( a2199/97 , cen30/45 ) or because groups based on shallow surveys do not faithfully represent the center of the cluster after fainter members have been included ( klemola 44 ) .",
    "groups found at the edge of a redshift survey tend to have their global parameters affected ; in particular the size , as originally listed in the group catalog , can differ . for example , the group radius of pavo  ii depends on the density threshold .",
    "this may also explain structure found in doradus .",
    "these problems should be kept in mind when investigating correlations that depend on the global cluster parameters such as size and velocity dispersion .",
    "as mentioned in section [ clusel ] , the group catalogs were derived from redshift surveys with differing limiting magnitudes and selection criteria . to make the distribution of our clusters / groups more uniform across the sky",
    "we added other systems in regions of the sky not covered by the redshift surveys .",
    "also , we have increased the number of cluster / group members by including early - type galaxies observed by other authors , below the magnitude limit of the redshift surveys .",
    "we have also checked other authors membership assignments .",
    "a galaxy was assigned to a cluster if it satisfied two conditions .",
    "the first condition is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the distance relative to the group center , determined from the group finding algorithm , and @xmath13 is the group pair radius ( both are in @xmath24 mpc , where @xmath25 kms@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "we fixed @xmath13 to 1 @xmath24 mpc for cen45 , not identified by the finding algorithm , for pavo  ii at the edge of the redshift survey , and for the five clusters added from the literature .",
    "the second condition is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radial velocity of the galaxy , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the systemic velocity and velocity dispersion of the group , respectively .",
    "this second requirement does not precisely represent the region within the caustic which marks the boundary of a cluster in redshift space ( kaiser 1987 ; regs & geller 1989 ) , but the small number of galaxies per cluster and the caustic s dependence on @xmath30 makes a more precise determination untenable .    to better approximate the real assignment of galaxies to the cluster",
    "we also define a class of `` peripheral '' objects , the criteria depending on the richness of the cluster . for the richest clusters ( virgo and coma ) , `` peripheral '' galaxies are those which satisfy one of two conditions : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or @xmath33 and @xmath34 , while for clusters with fewer members the second condition becomes @xmath35 .",
    "these conditions are intended to represent the region in redshift - space occupied by cluster members . applying these criteria ,",
    "increases the sample of the early - type galaxies by about 20% .",
    "when two clusters are close to each other as in the cases of a2199/97 and cen30/45 ambiguous cases remain .",
    "the impact of these objects on the distance relation is discussed in more detail in bernardi ( 2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : clu ] shows examples of the resulting projected distribution of objects in and around two of the clusters ( similar plots for the other clusters are available ; interested readers should contact the first author of this paper directly ) .",
    "the dashed circle corresponds to the angular size of @xmath36 at the cluster redshift .",
    "some systems are well sampled by the available redshift surveys ( coma , a1367 , virgo , fornax , eridanus , doradus ) , while at low galactic latitude clusters / groups are only covered by the shallow ors .",
    "the density of galaxies abruptly changes south of @xmath37 , the southern limit of the ssrs2 . from these projected distributions",
    ", we also found that some group centers , in the group catalogs , are not good estimates .",
    "this is the case , for pisces , hms0122 + 3305 , a2199 , and the nearby groups such as eridanus and doradus , but correcting the central positions leaves the galaxy assignments unaltered .",
    "we also also find that klemola  44 may be a superposition of two systems .",
    "overall @xmath38 of the early - type galaxies assigned to these groups have distances .",
    "there are 733 early - type galaxies assigned to the 28 selected clusters / groups ( hereafter the enearc catalog ) , of which 640 galaxies have velocity dispersions and @xmath2 measurements , where @xmath2 is the apparent diameter at a given isophotal level , as required to build the @xmath0 relation . of these , 495",
    "satisfy the most stringent membership criteria , whereas 145 are `` peripheral '' cluster objects . according to our adopted criteria , 15 galaxies assigned to the selected cluster sample by previous authors are non - members .",
    "these non - member galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : litwrong ] , where : column ( 1 ) is the name of the galaxy ; columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are the equatorial coordinates ; column ( 4 ) is the heliocentric redshift ; column ( 5 ) is the total magnitude @xmath39 ; column ( 6 ) is the name of the cluster to which the galaxy is assigned ; column ( 7 ) is the pair radius @xmath13 of the cluster ; column ( 8) is the cluster velocity dispersion ; column ( 9 ) is the projected distance of the galaxy from the cluster center , computed using the angular separation and the cluster redshift ; column ( 10 ) is the difference between the galaxy and cluster redshifts ; and column ( 11 ) references previous work .",
    "the information on the individual galaxies and groups comes from the literature and the original group catalogs , respectively .",
    "note that willmer ( 1991 ) had already pointed out that [ wfc91 ]  056 and eso  384g037 are interlopers in as753 , while jrgensen ( 1997 ) noted that d75 and [ wfc91 ]  039 were not members of a194 and as753 , respectively .",
    "the galaxies in table  [ tab : litwrong ] are , therefore , excluded from the enearc sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : histgalpar ] summarizes the measured parameters for early - type cluster galaxies .",
    "this figure shows the distribution of : redshift ( panel a ) ; @xmath40 ( panel b ) ; mg@xmath1 index ( panel c ) ; and the photometric parameter @xmath2 ( panel d ) .",
    "the data include both our measurements and those of other authors calibrated onto a common system as described in the next section .",
    "in addition to our all - sky enear redshift - distance survey , over the years we have gathered a large number of spectroscopic and photometric observations of early - type galaxies in clusters with the following three goals in mind : 1 ) increase the number of galaxies in clusters to improve the statistical accuracy of distance relations ; 2 ) measure many galaxies observed by other authors , in order to scale the available data into a common system and estimate our external errors ; 3 ) obtain repeat observations to estimate our internal errors on a run - by - run basis .",
    "repeat measurements also provide a way to eliminate disparate measurements and improve the statistical error per galaxy . since a non - negligible number of galaxies , mostly in clusters , had modern high - quality measurements available in the literature , we concentrated our efforts in clusters already studied by other authors .    in the following sections we describe the procedures adopted for homogenizing and combining the spectroscopic and photometric parameters which come from various sources .",
    "details of the observations , data reductions , parameter and error estimates obtained by the enear team are presented in wegner ( 2002 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion was measured in the interval @xmath41   .",
    "therefore , our estimates do not include the effects of the nad line which , because of interstellar absorption , could affect the velocity dispersion measurement ( dressler 1984 ) .",
    "it is known that for any given @xmath42 and instrumental resolution , there is a lower limit on the velocity dispersion measurable without introducing significant bias ( bender 1990 ) .",
    "the instrumental resolution of the setups used by the enear team range from 70  kms@xmath7 to 100  kms@xmath7 .",
    "we tested the reliability of the low velocity dispersion measurements by using : a ) internal repeated observations , and b ) simulations of synthetic noisy `` galaxy '' spectra ( wegner 2002 ) .",
    "the scatter (  15  % ) given by internal comparisons at low velocity dispersions ( @xmath43  kms@xmath7 ) is comparable with the errors ( 10  % -15  % ) associated with those measurements .",
    "simulated `` galaxy '' spectra , obtained by broadening the spectrum of a template star by gaussians of different velocity dispersion and by adding different noise , show that for spectra with @xmath44 per pixel the velocity dispersion can be measured reliably down to a value of @xmath45  % of the instrumental resolution .",
    "these results show that our random errors are reliable and that our velocity dispersion measurements are not biased  even for values which are smaller than the instrumental resolution . however , the above tests do not take into account about possible systematic effects due to template and galaxy mismatches or continuum subtraction problems .    in this section",
    "we describe the homogenization procedure for the enearc data which include our new measurements as well as data from the literature .",
    "the first step in homogenizing the velocity dispersions and line indices is to define a `` fiducial '' system to which all other measurements can be compared and converted . to achieve this we first brought our measurements onto the same internal system .",
    "the enear observations were chosen as this standard system because they are a large ( @xmath4 ) homogeneous set of measurements , which was designed to extensively overlap with other samples and our own individual observing runs .",
    "the enear observations were brought into a consistent system as described by wegner ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , the following procedure was used : we determined a mean offset , @xmath46 , between each galaxy in a given run and all the other runs .",
    "we then averaged over all galaxies in a run , weighting by the number of available pairs which yields @xmath46 for that run .",
    "we then subtracted @xmath46 from data in each run and repeat the process until no run has an offset above a predefined tolerance .",
    "we found no evidence for a more complicated correction for the data .",
    "the internal comparisons of the final redshift , velocity dispersion , and the mg@xmath1 index were found to be in good agreement , showing no systematic trends , and only small zero - point offsets .",
    "the mean redshift offset is @xmath47  kms@xmath7 with a scatter of @xmath48  kms@xmath7 ; in the case of the velocity dispersion , @xmath49 is always less than @xmath50 and has a scatter of @xmath51  dex .",
    "the mean @xmath52 offset is @xmath53  dex . finally , the line index mg@xmath1 has a mean zero - point offset of @xmath54  dex with a scatter of @xmath55  dex .",
    "the velocity dispersions and the values of the mg@xmath1 index were aperture - corrected to @xmath56  kpc ( wegner 2002 ) .",
    "the second step , after calibrating our measurements to a consistent system , was to convert published data to our reference system .",
    "an aperture correction consistent with our raw data was made before calibrating them to our `` fiducial '' system by a zero - point shift , using a procedure similar to the one above .",
    "zero - point corrections were only applied for those data sets for which the offset was larger than its error .",
    "table  [ tab : corrsp ] summarizes the results of this comparison of our data with those of other authors : in column ( 1 ) the source of published data ; in column ( 2 ) the number of velocity dispersion measurements involved in the comparison ; in column ( 3 ) the offset applied to each set of velocity dispersion measurements ; in column ( 4 ) the rms value of the differences in the comparison ; columns ( 5)-(7 ) show the same for the mg@xmath1 line index .",
    "all differences are computed as `` our - minus - literature '' .",
    "the comparisons listed in the table include only cluster galaxies except for the 7s sample ; for that sample we also compared the measurements of field galaxies .",
    "this was done to increase the accuracy of the comparison .",
    "in total we have 248 measurements of the velocity dispersion and 156 of the mg@xmath1 index in common with the literature .",
    "the external comparisons reported in the table show that the external offsets are , in general , comparable to the mean offset found from our internal comparisons .",
    "the measurements obtained by other authors were converted to our `` fiducial '' system by adding the offsets listed in table  [ tab : corrsp ] . in order to evaluate the final merged and standardized catalog of early - type galaxies a comparison has been made between different ( calibrated ) measurements of the same galaxy .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : compsp_lit1 ] for those datasets for which direct comparisons are available .",
    "the data sets of lucey ( 1997 ) and smith ( 1997 ) have very few galaxies in common with our sample .",
    "therefore , for these two data sets we had to rely on an indirect calibration .",
    "this was carried out by using the overlap between the data of these two papers with those of the literature converted directly into our system .",
    "figure  [ fig : compsp_lit2 ] shows the result of this indirect calibration .",
    "figure  [ fig : histczcl ] shows a histogram of the difference between our redshifts and the literature .",
    "the mean and rms scatter of the distribution are @xmath57 kms@xmath7 and @xmath58 kms@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "since the typical error in the radial velocity is of the order of @xmath59  kms@xmath7 we conclude that no correction is required for the redshift measurements .",
    "the spectroscopic data in the enearc catalog are summarized in table  [ tab : speobcl ] which gives : in column ( 1 ) the source of measurements ; in column ( 2 ) the number of new measurements obtained by our team ; in column ( 3 ) the number of galaxies for which spectroscopic parameters were measured ; in column ( 4 ) the number of galaxies for which there is only one source ; in columns ( 5)(7 ) the same information for the mg@xmath1 line index . in estimating the contribution of each author we tried to consider only independent measurements",
    ", although this is not always possible because some authors combined their new data with previous work .",
    "the number of measurements in the table reported for the authors refers only to galaxies in the enear database ( see paper  i ) .",
    "table  [ tab : speobcl ] shows that we obtained 338 measurements of the velocity dispersion for 229 galaxies and similar numbers for the mg@xmath1 index ; about one - third of our observations have repeats . using these data",
    ", we obtained new distances and mg@xmath1 indices for @xmath60 galaxies , thereby enlarging the sample of early - type galaxies that can be used in the construction of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "about 55% of the cluster sample still relies on single velocity dispersion measurements but most of these are now based on high - quality modern observations .",
    "details of the photometric observations are given in alonso ( 2002 ) .",
    "the same homogenization procedure described above was adopted for the photometric parameter @xmath2 . following the 7s",
    ", @xmath2 is the angular diameter of a circular aperture within which the average integrated surface brightness of a galaxy is equal to a specified value . in our case",
    "the angular diameter @xmath2 is measured at the @xmath61-band isophotal level of @xmath62 mag arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "this value roughly corresponds to the value adopted by the 7s in the @xmath63-band , assuming a mean color of @xmath64=1.5  mag .",
    "the light profiles were corrected for the effects of seeing ( saglia 1997 ) , flux calibrated and corrected for galactic extinction ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "alonso 2002 show that , for the galaxies in our sample , the burstein & heiles extinction corrections agree well with the values derived using the extinction maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the k - correction and cosmological surface brightness dimming correction were also applied .",
    "as in the case of the spectroscopic parameters , a homogeneous dataset is required .",
    "this is particularly important for combining photometric parameters since these come from a variety of sources , many using different filters . to calibrate the photometric parameter @xmath2 to the `` fiducial '' system",
    ", we first checked the internal consistency of our data by comparing the surface brightness profiles of galaxies for which we have more than one observation .",
    "for these objects , the dispersion among different measurements was found to be small ( @xmath65 mag / arcsec@xmath66 over an interval of typically 3 magnitudes ) , showing that our reduction and calibration procedures lead to uniform results ( see figure  3.6 , 3.7 , and 3.8 in bernardi  1999 ) .",
    "we also compared our measures of the surface brightness profiles with those in previous works .",
    "this was done to estimate if differences in the zero - point of the photometric calibration , or variations in the filters / colors used by different sources could contribute to the differences observed in the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "we found that the comparisons of our surface brightness profiles with those of other sources do not show any systematic gradient or statistically significant offset ( see figure  3.4 in bernardi  1999 ) .",
    "these results justify our choice of applying simple offsets in homogenizing the @xmath2 parameter . as before , our observations were used to define the reference system ; we brought the measurements to a common system by minimizing the mean differences in the @xmath2 derived from galaxies observed in more than one run .",
    "the required corrections to bring the measurements into a common system were relatively small : @xmath67  dex with a rms scatter of @xmath68  dex ( alonso 2002 ) .",
    "the measurements available in the literature were calibrated to our internal reference system by applying the offsets listed in table  [ tab : corrph ] , if the offset is larger than its error .",
    "this table summarizes the results of the comparison between our data and those of other authors listing : in column ( 1 ) the source of published data ; in column ( 2 ) the number of measurements involved in the comparison ; in column ( 3 ) the difference between our measurements and those in the literature ; and in column ( 4 ) the rms value of these differences .",
    "there are 379 @xmath2 measurements in common with the literature .",
    "the required corrections are small and the scatter compares with that obtained from our internal comparisons , suggesting that one can safely combine the measurements from different data sets .",
    "these comparisons are shown in figure  [ fig : compdn_lit ] after each individual data set was calibrated to the fiducial system .",
    "the agreement is good , with the dispersion being generally smaller than 0.02  dex .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence of systematic trends , justifying our use of single offsets to bring all of the published data into a common system .",
    "as for the spectroscopic parameters , the comparison with the 7s sample also includes field galaxies .",
    "the photometric data assembled for the enearc sample are summarized in table  [ tab : phoobcl ] where we list : in column ( 1 ) the source of measurements ; in column ( 2 ) the passband in which the data were measured ; in column ( 3 ) the number of new measurements including repeat observations ; in column ( 4 ) the number of galaxies with measured photometric parameters ; and in column ( 5 ) the number of galaxies for which there is only one source .",
    "we have measured 508 @xmath2 for a total of 348 enearc galaxies , of which 117 had no previous measurements . about @xmath69% of the cluster sample",
    "still relies on single measurements , making the cross - comparison between different sources extremely important .",
    "as a final result , we have assembled a sample of 640 early - type galaxies in 28 clusters with redshift , velocity dispersion , @xmath2 measurements and , whenever possible , the mg@xmath1 line index using the membership criteria described above .",
    "of these galaxies , 495 are considered cluster members and 145 `` peripheral '' objects .",
    "all 640 objects were individually inspected and 188  galaxies were removed due to peculiarities and/or problems on their images and/or their spectra ( residual contamination from nearby galaxies or stars ; presence of spiral arms or bar ; dust lane ; high @xmath70 ; emission lines ; low @xmath42 ) that could affect the measurement of their photometric and spectroscopic parameters .    table  7 tabulates the main measured parameters for the 452 galaxies suitable for constructing the @xmath0 relation and table  8 contains the 188 cluster galaxies eliminated from further consideration , respectively . for each cluster these tables give : in column ( 1 ) the name of the galaxy ; in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) the 1950.0 equatorial coordinates ; in column ( 4 ) the morphological @xmath71 type following lauberts & valentijn ( 1989 ) ; in column ( 5 ) the total @xmath63-band magnitude @xmath39 taken from the literature ; in column ( 6 ) the number of redshift and velocity dispersion measurements obtained from our new data ; in column ( 7 ) the number of redshift and velocity dispersion measurements available in the literature ; in columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) the heliocentric redshift and its error ; in columns ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) the logarithm of the velocity dispersion measurement and its error ; in columns ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) the number of mg@xmath1 line index measurements available from our new data and from the literature ; and in columns ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) the value and error of the mg@xmath1 line index .",
    "similarly , columns ( 16)-(19 ) give the same information for the photometric parameter @xmath72 ( @xmath2 in 0.1  arcmin ) .",
    "in addition , table  8 gives ( column  20 ) a reference to the notes to the table indicate the reason(s ) for removing the galaxy from the enearc sample .",
    "the parameters listed in these tables are combined values obtained from the error - weighted mean of the individual measurements using a @xmath73-clipping .",
    "in this paper we present spectroscopic ( redshift , velocity dispersion , and mg@xmath1 index ) and photometric ( @xmath2 ) data for 640 galaxies in 28 clusters comprising our enearc catalog .",
    "the assignment of galaxies to groups and clusters was based on a compilation of objectively identified groups derived from complete redshift surveys of the nearby universe .",
    "roughly 2% of the galaxies were previously assigned to clusters erroneously .",
    "the data presented here are a combination of 338 new spectroscopic measurements of 229 galaxies , and 508 new @xmath61-band images of 348 galaxies , in addition to those taken from the literature .",
    "the large number of galaxies in common with other authors , permits all data to be calibrated into one reference system .",
    "bernardi ( 2002 ) use 452 galaxies of enearc to determine the @xmath0 relation used for enear .    in a forthcoming paper",
    "we intend to also measure the fp parameters for the enearc galaxies in order to build a template relation for nearby clusters which will serve as a reference for similar studies at high redshift .",
    "it is important to point out that the present sample can be significantly expanded by using currently available wide - field imagers and multi - object spectrographs such as 6df ( http://www.aao.gov.au/ukst/6df.html ) and it may be well worth the effort .",

    "<S> this paper presents data on the enearc subsample of the larger enear survey of the nearby early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the enearc galaxies belong to clusters and were specifically chosen to be used for the construction of a @xmath0 template . </S>",
    "<S> the enearc sample includes new measurements of spectroscopic and photometric parameters ( redshift , velocity dispersion , line index mg@xmath1 , and the angular diameter @xmath2 ) as well as data from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> new spectroscopic data are given for 229 cluster early - type galaxies and new photometry is presented for 348 objects . repeat and overlap observations with external data sets are used to construct a final merged catalog consisting of 640 early - type galaxies in 28 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> objective criteria , based on catalogs of groups of galaxies derived from complete redshift surveys of the nearby universe , are used to assign galaxies to clusters . in a companion paper </S>",
    "<S> these data are used to construct the template @xmath0 distance relation for early - type galaxies which has been used to estimate galaxy distances and derive peculiar velocities for the enear all - sky sample . </S>"
