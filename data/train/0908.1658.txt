    "hydrogen ( h ) is a common impurity in silicon ( si ) which is particularly important as a passivator of surfaces and bulk defects.@xcite the role of hydrogen in semiconductors is highlighted in a review by estreicher.@xcite adding nitrogen ( n ) impurities to silicon affects the formation of voids and may increase the strength of the silicon crystal by immobilising dislocations , which reduces warping during wafer processing.@xcite the majority of silicon used in device technologies is manufactured in a quartz crucible by the czochralski ( cz ) process , during which oxygen ( o ) from the quartz readily enters the melt , see for example the review by newman.@xcite    a wide variety of experimental probes are used to study defects in silicon , but it is often difficult to determine their detailed structures from measurements alone .",
    "theoretical studies using _ ab initio _ techniques are helpful in this regard , as they are used to calculate both the defect formation energies and some of their experimental signatures . for example , local vibrational modes of defects are accessible to infra - red ( ir ) absorption experiments and may also be calculated within _ ab initio _ methods .    throughout this paper",
    "we denote a defect complex by listing its constituent atoms between braces , @xmath11 , where a subscript denotes whether an atom is substitutional ( s ) or interstitial ( i ) .",
    "for example , a defect containing two interstitial hydrogen atoms and a substitutional nitrogen atom is denoted by @xmath12 . despite hydrogen and nitrogen being common impurities in silicon , we are aware of only one _ ab initio _ theoretical study of their interaction.@xcite it was concluded that both @xmath13 and @xmath14 defects are able to trap hydrogen atoms , although with smaller binding energies than that of a hydrogen atom and a vacancy .",

    "oxygen impurity atoms may be used for gettering metallic impurities , which increases the overall crystal quality , but they also form electrically active thermal donors ( td).@xcite tds can affect the local resistivity within the silicon wafer.@xcite in addition , oxygen also interacts with nitrogen in bulk silicon to form tds , and small concentrations of hydrogen can greatly enhance the formation of tds.@xcite it has been shown that the presence of hydrogen molecules in silicon crystals enhances the diffusion of oxygen .",
    "it has also been suggested that hydrogen passivates the electrical activity of n / o complexes in cz - si.@xcite    it is clear from these examples that the interactions between hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen impurities in silicon lead to important and complicated behavior .",
    "here we present the results of a computational search for low - energy defect complexes in silicon containing hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen atoms .",
    "we confirm the stability of many of the previously - known defects and also report the structures and formation energies of some new low - energy defects . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "first , we choose the size of the disruption to the perfect silicon lattice by defining the radius of a sphere in which the impurity atoms are to be placed randomly .",
    "we choose radii between 3 and 7  .",
    "secondly , we chose the number of silicon atoms to have their positions ramdomized . in this study",
    "we randomize the position of 1 to 3 silicon atoms depending on the number of hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen impurity atoms present .",
    "the randomization sphere is centered on the centroid of the removed silicon atoms . finally , the required number of hydrogen , nitrogen and oxygen impurity atoms and the chosen 1 , 2 or 3 silicon atoms are placed at random positions within the sphere .",
    "the configurations are then relaxed using the calculated density - functional - theory ( dft ) forces .",
    "our calculations are performed using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) density functional of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite we use the plane - wave basis - set code castep,@xcite with its built - in ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite which include non - linear core corrections.@xcite all of the results presented here are for non - spin - polarized systems .",

    "we perform the same computational convergence tests as described in ref .  , finding excellent convergence with a 2@xmath182@xmath182 k - point sampling , which we use for all the results reported here .",
    "the searches we report in this paper are carried out in a body - centered - cubic simulation cell which would hold 32 atoms of crystalline silicon .",
    "although this is a small cell , tests indicate that it is adequate for obtaining good structures for most of the defects studied and reasonably accurate formation energies , while keeping the computational cost low enough to permit extensive searching . in a previous study,@xcite",
    "we reported results for hydrogen / silicon complexes in silicon .",
    "the searches were carried out in the same 32-atom cell used here , but each of the defect structures was re - relaxed in a 128-atom cell to obtain more accurate structures and energies .",
    "the defect formation energies for the 32-atom cells were not reported , but they are in fact in excellent agreement with the 128-atom values .",

    "we should not , of course , expect a 32-atom cell to be sufficient for all point - defect calculations in silicon , and especially not for charged defect states , but there is a strong case for believing it to be adequate for the purposes of the current study .",
    "in order to define defect formation energies it is necessary to specify the chemical potentials of the atomic species .",
    "the chemical potential for silicon is taken to be the bulk silicon value , so that the energy cost to add a silicon atom to a defect is the energy of a silicon atom in perfect crystalline silicon .",
    "the chemical potential for hydrogen is derived from the lowest energy hydrogen defect in silicon , which is an interstitial molecule at the tetrahedral site , @xmath34 , with the bond pointing along a @xmath35 direction .",

    "we note from the data in table [ table : defect_formation_energies ] that the lowest energy defects are normally those having completely saturated bonds . a similar result for hydrogen defects in silicon",
    "was reported in ref .  .",
    "this simple and rather obvious rule is useful for choosing combinations of impurity atoms which might form stable defects .",
    "consider a host crystal containing three types of impurity atom .",
    "( an example might be h / n / o impurities in silicon as studied here , but without the possibility of silicon vacancy formation which was allowed in our study of h / n defects . ) limiting the total number of impurity atoms to be @xmath794 gives 34 possible cell contents for which searches must be performed . increasing the number of possible impurities to five ( while maintaining the maximum number of impurities in a cell to be @xmath794 ) gives a total of 125 possible cell contents .",
    "the extra impurities could be other types of atoms , but they could also be host vacancies @xmath80 and interstitials @xmath19 , although this would reduce the number of possible cell contents to 112 because introducing a host vacancy and interstitial is the same as not introducing either . searching over the `` impurities '' h / n / o/@xmath19/@xmath80 in silicon , with a maximum number of impurities of @xmath794 and the same computational parameters as in the present study would cost about three times as much as the present study .",
    "for each set of cell contents we have in this work performed between about 20900 structural relaxations , which appeared to be adequate in this case , although the required number is expected to increase rapidly with the size of the `` hole '' in the host crystal . in some cases it may be necessary to use larger `` holes '' to obtain all of the low - energy defects , and perhaps larger simulation cells as well .",
    "we have automated the search procedure and the calculations are performed in parallel .",
    "it appears to us that defect structure searches of the type described in this paper with up to , say , five types of impurity are perfectly feasible with modern computing facilities",
    ".    we are grateful to phil hasnip and michael rutter for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) of the united kingdom .",
    "computational resources were provided by the cambridge high performance computing service ."
