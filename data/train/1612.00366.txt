    "the zero - order terms have already been accounted for in appendix [ sec : scattering.conduction ] , and therefore , we disregard them here . disregarding higher - order terms in the magnon operators , we find that @xmath277 we now substitute the delocalized states derived in appendices [ sec : scattering.magnons ] and [ sec : scattering.conduction ] into eq .",

    "the amplitude of a magnon state @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) along the interface is given by @xmath278 on the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) sublattice and @xmath279 on sublattice @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "four different combinations of delta functions appear because each of the conduction electron states @xmath282 has two components .",
