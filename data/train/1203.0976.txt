    "a significant number of quantum computation and quantum information protocols use the quadrature amplitudes of the quantized electromagnetic field @xcite , @xcite . the essence of all these protocols rely in the possibility of producing entangled photons in optical nonlinear mediums @xcite .    in particular , the nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( npa ) with injected signal , and the spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spd ) generate squeezed states of light @xcite and are paradigmatic processes in the realm of the continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of any nonlinear optical process depends strongly on this wave - vector mis- match .",
    "the emission is brightest if the various fields are coherent over the full length of the 8    dispersion in the nonlinear material between pump , signal , and idler waves hereby plays an inhibiting role and should be eliminated .",
    "this can be achieved with the use of birefringent nonlinear crystals . in such crystals",
    "perfect phase matching can be attained by appropriately orienting the crystal axes , and the wave vectors and polarization vectors of the input fields .",
    "however , it is often the case that the strongest nonlinearities can not be addressed in this man- ner .",
    "consequently , considerable effort has been devoted to develop materials that combine perfect phase matching with a strong nonlinear response , resulting in a multitude of quasi- phase - matched and periodically - poled materials [ 88 , 89 ] .",
    "it is then worth to inquire how the quality of entanglement achieved in a parametric amplifier and in a spontaneous parametric downconversion can be affected when the phase matching condition can not be completely achieved in actual experiments .",
    "it is known from classical nonlinear optics @xcite that the existence of a phase mismatch ( i.e. a nonzero @xmath0 ) , that occurs during the propagation in the nonlinear medium , modify the power of the signal and of the idler .",
    "therefore , absence of perfect phase matching will certainly affect efficient amplification , degree of squeezing and entanglement of the interacting modes .",
    "in this paper we generalize the usual analysis of the nondegenerate parametric processes @xcite to take into account the influence of the phase mismatch in the degree of entanglement . in the classical version of this problem @xcite the phase - mismatch is mathematically equivalent to a detuning in the frequency of the interacting modes .",
    "the corresponding quantized version is described by an extension of the usual hamiltonean @xcite which is no more time independent in the interaction picture .",
    "we compute the exact solution of the heisenberg equations of motion to find the time dependent bosonic operators that explicitly depend on the phase - mismatch .",
    "this model also describes nondegenerate parametric interactions of waves with finite spectral bandwidth @xcite , this is , the energy conservation rule is obeyed within the imprecision of the finite bandwidth of the pump field .",
    "the characterization of the entanglement will be done using the well stablished techniques of continuous variables gaussian states developed for bipartite systems @xcite , this is , we use the formalism of the covariance matrix to compute the von neumann entropy of each mode as well as the logarithmic negativity of the composite system , for different initial quantum states . in all cases",
    "we prove that the degree of entanglement decreases with increasing mismatch or with finite bandwidth .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in sec.ii we introduce the hamiltonean of the system with phase - mismatch , solve the heisenberg equations of motion for the bosonic operators and compute the average number of generated photons . in sec .",
    "iii we compute the covariance matrix of the system for different initial states and determine in each case the degree of entanglement of the system . finally in sec.iv",
    "we present some conclusions .",
    "in the npa a pump mode with frequency @xmath1 and wavevector @xmath2 interacts in a nonlinear medium with a mode of frequency @xmath3 and wavevector @xmath4 ( the signal ) which grows . in the process",
    "an auxiliary mode of frequency @xmath5 and wavevector @xmath6 ( the idler ) is created .",
    "the spdc differs from the npa because the only input to the nonlinear medium is the pump mode and downconversion to the lower - frequency modes @xmath3 and @xmath5 is spontaneous .",
    "we consider that the incident pump mode is intense and can be treated classically as a field of complex amplitude @xmath7 , only modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are described by the bosonic operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in both cases",
    "the three modes obey the energy conservation rule @xmath12 and the phase mismatch @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonean describing both processes and that generalizes @xcite , is given by @xcite @xmath14 where the interaction time @xmath15 is the propagation time in the nonlinear medium therefore proportional to the travelled distance @xmath16 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath17 with @xmath18 results from the mismatch along @xmath16 and the coupling constant @xmath19 is proportional to the second order susceptibility of the medium and to the amplitude of the pump .",
    "the hamiltonean ( [ hamiltonean ] ) can also describe the interaction between a classical wave of central frequency @xmath20 and bandwidth @xmath21 , with two quantized modes of frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and such that the energy conservation rule @xmath12 is obeyed .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath22 jointly with their hermitian conjugates , which are decoupled from these two . when the mismatch is zero the integration of these equations is done in the interaction picture . however",
    ", this usual approach does nt work in the case of a nonzero mismatch because it does nt remove the time factor @xmath23 from the heisenberg equations . in order to obtain an autonomous system of equations we are going to define new annhilation operators @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 , by the following canonical transformation @xmath26 physically this corresponds to move to a reference frame that rotates with the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "the heisenberg equations for the new operators @xmath24 and @xmath28 are then given by @xmath29 they are linear time independent differential equations and can be readily integrated .",
    "the only solution of eq.([heis1 ] ) with physical interest corresponds to the condition @xmath30 where the mismatch is small compared with the coupling parameter . by inverting eq.([fa ] ) and using the solution to eq.([heis1 ] ) we obtain finally the time dependent bosonic operators @xmath31\\ ] ] @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is an effective dimensionless interaction time , @xmath34 is the dimensionless mismatch parameter with values in the interval @xmath35 , the effective frequency of oscillation of mode @xmath36 is @xmath37 .    the system of equations ( [ time1 ] ) and ( [ time2 ] ) is a kind of _ generalized boguolibov transformation _ where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the hyperbolic functions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the bosonic operators at time @xmath43 .    equations ( [ time1 ] ) and ( [ time2 ] ) extend the well known result @xcite to take into account the influence of the phase - mismatch .",
    "the corresponding bosonic operators derived in @xcite are obtained by making @xmath44 in the last equations .",
    "the argument of the hyperbolic functions is the squeezing parameter , @xmath45 which is a generalization of the usual squeezing parameter @xmath46 .",
    "it depends not only on the interaction time @xmath15 , but also on the mismatch . for a given interaction time",
    "the intensity of the squeezing parameter decreases with increasing mismatch .    from the heisenberg equations ( [ heis ] ) we obtain the following integral of motion",
    "@xmath47 which is a generalization , for nonzero mismatch , of the analog integral of motion derived in @xcite",
    ". we have introduced in the previous equation the initial mean number of photons @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this integral of motion says that each time the pump creates a photon in mode ( 1 ) it also creates a photon in mode ( 2 ) therefore , the difference of photons between these modes at any time @xmath15 is equal to their difference at the initial time @xmath43 and that it is independent of the phase - mismatch . for uncorrelated input vacuum states",

    "is equivalent to the lack of information ( mixedness ) of the reduced state of each subsystem .",
    "for mixed states , each subsystem has its own level of impurity , and moreover the global state is itself characterized by a nonzero mixedness which makes difficult to define a single measure of entanglement .",
    "we assume that our system can be in three different initial states . in the first case ,",
    "modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 are excited from the vacuum state , i.e. , the initial state is @xmath69 , which is the case of the spontaneous parametric downconversion . in the second case",

    "such operations leave entropy and entanglement invariant . for uncorrelated vacuum inputs ,",

    "the degree of entanglement in a pure bipartite system is equivalent to the degree of mixedness of each subsystem and is properly quantified by the entropy of entanglement @xmath90 , defined as the von neumann entropy of its reduced density operator @xcite . in terms of the entries of the cm @xmath91 , the von neumann entropy of each mode is given by @xcite , @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the symplectic eigenvalue of the reduced single - mode cm @xmath95 .",
    "each mode displays maximal disorder subjected to given physical constrains .",
