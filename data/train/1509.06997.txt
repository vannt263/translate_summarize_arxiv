    "general relativity ( gr ) is the physical theory of gravity formulated by einstein in @xmath3 .",
    "it is based on the equivalence principle of gravitation and inertia , which establishes a fundamental connection between the gravitational field and the geometry of the spacetime , and on the principle of general covariance .",
    "gr is the most widely accepted gravity theory and it has been tested in several field strength regimes , but not the only relativistic theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "this theory explains the gravity as the curvature of spacetime .",
    "the relative motion of test particles is one of the most important sources of information about the gravitational field and spacetime geometry .",
    "this motion is described by the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "it may be claimed that the gde is one of the most important equations in relativity , as this is how one measures spacetime curvature .",
    "this aspect has been discussed by szekeres @xcite . the spacetime curvature described by the riemann tensor manifests through the geodesic deviation equation@xcite-@xcite , the relative acceleration of the test particles , also known as tidal acceleration .",
    "the signification of the equation of geodesic deviation in relation to the relative acceleration and tidal forces between two neighboring freely falling test particles under gravity has been repeately stressed since the mid fifties .",
    "the importance of the geodesic deviation equation ( gde ) for spinless particles is studied by the authors @xcite,@xcite , and they certify its importance when we study gravitational wave phenomena and their detection .",
    "the geodesic deviation equation ( gde ) provides an elegant tool to investigate the timelike , null and spacelike structure of spacetime geometries and the important raychaudhuri equation @xcite , the mattig relation @xcite and the pirani equation@xcite may be obtained by solving it .",
    "recent observations of the supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr)@xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) surveys @xcite , the large scale structure@xcite and the weak lensing @xcite , clearly indicate that the universe is currently expanding with an accelerating rate .",
    "this accelerating expansion is one of the most important puzzles of contemporary physics . as a consequence ,",
    "all observations related to gravity should be described within a framework including the cosmological constant in the einstein field equation .",
    "another way proposed to explain this acceleration of the universe , is to modify the einstein lagrangian i.e. , modified gravity theory known as the generalization of the einstein field equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "nowdays , within these extended theories we have one a class of modified gravity theories in which the gravitational action contains a general function @xmath0 .",
    "this theory namely @xmath0 modified gravity , is a generalization of @xmath4 theory of gravity and several important results have been found in such theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "because of the interesting results and the progress realized in this framework it seems there is still room to study some motivating gravitational and cosmological aspects of @xmath5 gravity which have not yet been studied .",
    "the gde has been studied in @xmath4 gravity theory @xcite,@xcite and the @xmath6 gravity @xcite , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denote the curvature scalar and the torsion scalar , respectively and to the key with excellent results . as these authors",
    ", the goal in this paper is to extend the study of gde in the metric context of @xmath0 gravity to obtain the gr equivalent gde of @xmath0 gravity and studying some particular cases .",
    "in this section we briefly review @xmath0 gravity and we provide the background cosmological equations in a universe governed by such a modified gravitational sector .",
    "the action for this theory coupled with matter lagrangian @xmath7 is given by @xcite , @xmath8\\,\\ , , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is an arbitrary function of the curvature scalar @xmath1 , and of the trace @xmath2 of the energy - momentum tensor , respectively , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the gravitation constant .",
    "we define the energy - momentum tensor associated to the matter as @xmath11 and its trace by @xmath12 . by assuming that the matter lagrangian density",
    "@xmath13 only depends on the components of the metric tensor @xmath14 , and not on its derivatives , we obtain @xmath15 within the metric formalism , varying the action @xmath16 with respect to the metric , one obtains the following field equations , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote derivates of @xmath19 with respect to the @xmath20 , @xmath21 respectively , @xmath22 is the dalembert operator,@xmath23 is the covariant derivative associated with the levi - civita connection of the metric tensor and @xmath24 is determined by @xmath25 however in the present study , we assume that the whole content of the universe is a perfect fluid , and in this way , the simple setting of the matter lagrangian is taking @xmath26 .",
    "then , with the use of eq ( [ 5 ] ) , we obtain for the variation of stress - energy of perfect fluid , the following expression @xmath27 thus the equation motion ( [ 4 ] ) becomes , @xmath28 by contracting the last equation by @xmath29 , we obtain the relation between the ricci scalar @xmath1 and the trace @xmath2 of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath30 from the equation ( [ 7a ] ) , on write the ricci tensor as @xmath31 , \\label{7c } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined the operator @xmath32 as , @xmath33 we obtain also from the equation ( [ 7b ] ) the ricci scalar defined as @xmath34.\\label{7d }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the field equations ( [ 7a ] ) can be expressed as the einstein field equations with an effective energy - momentum tensor @xcite in the form @xmath35,\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{\\kappa}{f'(r ) } \\bigl(t_{\\mu\\nu}+t_{\\mu\\nu}^{eff}\\bigr ) ,    \\label{8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] representing the effective energy - momentum tensor , which could be interpreted as the energy momentum tensor of the curvature fluid .    here we consider the homogeneous and isotropic flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , where the line element is defined as @xmath37,\\label{10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath38 the scale factor and @xmath39 the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy - momentum tensor of the matter is given by @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the energy density and the pressure of fluid , respectively .",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ 10a ] ) is @xmath43 thus , the ricci scalar in this background is given by @xcite @xmath44",
    "we describe in this section a several notions about the geodesic deviation equation in general relativity ( gr ) . for this purpose",
    ", we consider two neighbor geodesics @xmath45 and @xmath46 with an affine parameter @xmath47 on 2-surface s ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the parametric equation of the surface is given by @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is the labels geodesics .",
    "the vector field @xmath50 is tangent to the geodesic .",
    "the family @xmath49 has @xmath51 like it s tangent vector field .",

    "in this paper , we have presented the geodesic deviation equation ( gde ) in the metric formalism of @xmath0 theories .",
    "the calculations of the ricci scalar and the riemann tensor have been done firtly by using the @xmath0 fields gravity equations .",
    "the geodesic deviation equation and the generalization of the pirani equation for the flrw universe in @xmath0 gravity is investigated and both these equations reduces to the well known relation when @xmath70 .",
    "we focused our attention on two particular cases , the gde for fundamental observes and the past directed null vector fields with flrw universe . within these cases",
    "we have obtained the raychaudhuri equation , the generalized mattig relation and the diametric angular distance differential for @xmath0 gravity theory .",
    "furthermore , in the similar way to the gr , the focusing for past - directed null geodesics condition for @xmath0 gravity is be done .",
    "numerically results of the geodesic deviation @xmath63 and observer area distance @xmath64 for the @xmath0 model where compared with those of the @xmath65 model .",
