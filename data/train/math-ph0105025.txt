    "<S> the difference with the traditional approach is that in our approach the mollifier is chosen not from the consideration of the algebraic construction but from the consideration of the original differential equation .    in some cases ( shock waves ) </S>",

    "<S> it turned out that the approach developed here can be used for describing both the propagation of nonlinear waves and , which is the most important , their interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the problem of interaction of nonlinear traveling waves ( for instance , of two kinks or two solitons ) in the case of a single spatial variable can be formulated as a problem of constructing the exact solution of a nonlinear equation with two spatial variables corresponding to the coordinates of the wave fronts . </S>",
    "<S> if the initial problem can be integrated by the method of the inverse scattering problem or in any other way , then one can write out the solution of the above - mentioned equation explicitly , which allows one to describe the interaction analytically . in our approach , to describe the interaction , one needs to solve an ordinary differential equation ( or a system of such equations ) with a small parameter . </S>",
