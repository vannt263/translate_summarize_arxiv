    "the last few years have settled the debate about the origin of long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the hint provided by grb980425 and sn1998bw @xcite was finally taken when the spectroscopic follow - up of the afterglow of grb030329 revealed the unambiguous signatures of a very energetic supernova ",
    "sn 2003dh @xcite . soon thereafter , another clear - cut sn1998bw look - alike emerged in the afterglow of grb031203 @xcite . while the swift satellite @xcite has been very successful in finding grbs over a large redshift range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wait for the next spectacular case of a nearby grb - supernova has lasted more than two years .",
    "grb060218 was detected by the bat instrument on - board the swift satellite @xcite on february 18.149 2006 ut .",
    "this burst had exceptional high - energy properties @xcite .",
    "the peak energy of the event ( sect  [ xrays ] ) was very low and we will hereafter refer to this burst as an x - ray flash .",
    "xrf060218 is one of the longest bursts ever detected , and the unusual properties gave a very confused early impression .",
    "several gcns indicated that this was probably not a proper grb , and our optical monitoring programme was therefore somewhat delayed .",
    "however , eventually this turned out to be a very interesting low-@xmath4 event @xcite with a likely association to a supernova @xcite .",
    "the transient has now been detected over a wide wavelength range , from x - rays @xcite to radio @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the optical transient , and the early spectral and photometric evolution of this supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ observations ] outlines how the optical observations were obtained and reduced .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "[ results ] , which includes @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-band lightcurves as well as spectra of the sn , and an analysis of the host galaxy .",
    "we end the paper with a discussion ( sect .",
    "[ discussion ] ) where we compare the properties of this sn with other relevant sne .",
    "the observations for xrf060218 were somewhat complicated and hampered by the celestial position of the burst .",
    "being close to the sun it could only be observed for a short time right after sunset .",
    "we have used the combined efforts of two telescopes , at a northern and a southern observatory , to follow the object until it faded into the glare of the sun , about 50 days past the burst . for the final observations we had to restrict ourselves to a single passband ( @xmath2 ) due to the limited time available for observations in the twillight .",
    "we obtained imaging of the transient of xrf060218 with the eso / danish 1.5  m telescope ( d1.5 m ) on la silla equipped with the dfosc instrument , which offers a @xmath5 arcminute field - of - view ( fov ) at 0.395 arcsec per pixel .",
    "we also used the 2.56  m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on la palma equipped with alfosc which offers a fov of @xmath6 arcminutes with a pixel scale of 0.189 arcsec , as well as stancam which has a pixel scale of 0.176 arcsec over @xmath7 arcminutes .",
    "the journal of observations is given in table  [ t : log ] .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques for de - biasing and flat - fielding .",
    "spectra of the source were obtained with alfosc at four epochs , february 21 , 22 and 24 and on march 2 .",
    "these epochs correspond to 3.78 , 4.71 , 6.71 and 12.71 days past the burst .",
    "each spectrum had an integration time of 2400 seconds using grism 4 and a 1.3 arcsec wide slit .",
    "this set - up provided a dispersion of 3    per pixel .",
    "the spectral range covered is from 3300 to 9200  .",
    "there is some second order contamination above 6600   , and significant fringing above @xmath8   .",
    "the spectra were taken at or close to the parallactic angle .",
    "we note that apart from the first spectrum , taken at an airmass of 1.93 , all spectra were achieved at an airmass @xmath9 .",
    "the not / alfosc has a high efficiency in the uv , so we put emphasis on obtaining the bluest part of the spectrum .",
    "the spectra were reduced following standard procedures in midas and iraf .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved by comparison to images taken of helium and neon lamps .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using the spectrophotometric standard star gd71 @xcite , which was observed every night close in time to the supernova observation .",
    "finally , the absolute flux - calibration was achieved by comparison to the contemporary ( or interpolated ) @xmath1-band photometry .",
    "when comparing to synthetic photometry obtained by integrating each spectrum under the filter profiles , we discovered that some of the spectra have suffered from differential slit losses .",
    "this has been considered in the analysis below .",
    "aperture photometry of the transient was carried out using a combination of daophot @xcite and sextractor @xcite .",
    "we measured the magnitudes of the supernova as well as for 9 stars in the field in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands ( 7 local standards in the @xmath0 band ) .",
    "the relative magnitudes were transformed to the standard system using observations of photometric standard stars @xcite .",

    "the reddening associated with galactic extinction is e(@xmath31)=0.14  mag according to the maps by @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectra @xcite can be used to check this . using the sodium lines to estimate the reddening",
    "( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides e(@xmath31)=0.127 for the milky way , and e(@xmath31)=0.042  mag for the grb host .",
    "this is consistent with adopting a total reddening of e(@xmath31)=0.14  mag .",
    "we note that @xcite required e(@xmath32 mag based on the assumption of thermal radiation detected by uvot .",
    "this is higher than claimed by @xcite .",
    "it is known that the na  i  d lines do not provide a robust measure of the extinction , and could be influenced by e.g. , the ionization state in the host ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the overall properties of the host galaxy based on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modeling ( sect .  [ modeling ] ) , as well as the measured balmer line decrement ( sect .",
    "[ other ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also argue for a low host extinction . in the following",
    "we will therefore adopt a total extinction of e@xmath33  mag .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the sn are then m@xmath34 and m@xmath35 mag . finally , correcting these estimates for host contamination ( @xmath36 ) and k - corrections ( @xmath37 ) our best estimates are m@xmath38 and m@xmath39 mag .",
    "these are the magnitudes adopted for comparison to other sne , and are given in table  [ t : summary ] .",
    "lightcurves for type ic sne are relatively rare in the @xmath0 band . for sn2006aj , we started our @xmath0-band imaging campaign 5 days past the burst . at this epoch ,",
    "the @xmath0 band was already close to maximum light .",
    "we then followed the evolution of the @xmath0-band flux until 25 days past the burst , after which the supernova became to faint ( also compared to the host ) to allow further monitoring .",
    "given the sparse pre - maximum coverage , the estimates are somewhat more uncertain in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we estimate @xmath40 days .",
    "the estimate of the corrected light curve shape is rather uncertain , due to the large correction for host contamination on the already steep lightcurve .",
    "we estimate @xmath16m@xmath41 .",
    "the peak brightness is m@xmath42 mag , which converts to an absolute @xmath0-band magnitude of m@xmath43 in the vega magnitude system .",
    "the k - corrections are most uncertain in the @xmath0 band , and could also be significant in particular for the latest epochs where the spectrum falls very steeply in that region . at around @xmath0-band maximum light",
    ", we estimate a k - correction of @xmath44  mag . applying this k - correction , and a correction for the host galaxy ( @xmath45  mag ) we therefore estimate the final absolute magnitude m(@xmath46 .",
    "we summarize all corrected lightcurve parameters in table  [ t : summary ] . in this table , the rise times are corrected for time dilation , as are the light curve shapes which are also corrected for the underlying host galaxy .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are corrected for extinction , host galaxy contamination and are k - corrected .",
    "the flux - calibrated spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : spectra ] .",
    "the continuum - like spectrum with broad bumps renders a classification of this burst as a type ic supernova , based on the lack of conspicuous sn lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral evolution is well represented , the most obvious development being the depression of the uv flux with time .",
    "some of the depression seen in our final spectrum may be attributed to differential slit losses , but the overall evolution of the spectra are correct , as can be seen from the comparison to the broad band light curves .",
    "in fact , the uv depression is a common feature of sne and reflects the increased line blanketing due to low ionization iron group elements .",
    "as seen from the lightcurve , the @xmath0 band actually peaked close to the date of our third spectrum , so we see the rise of the @xmath0 band up to that epoch in the spectral evolution , followed by a rapid decline to the final spectrum .",
    "our latest spectrum , taken 12.3 days past burst in the rest frame , shows a dramatic evolution of the flux towards the red part of the spectrum .",
    "the broad red bumps are common features of so - called hypernovae and signal huge expansion velocities of the ejecta . interpreting the inflection point at @xmath47  as the si ii 6355   feature seen in other grb - sne @xcite , we can estimate an expansion velocity of @xmath48  km  s@xmath28 . at 12 days past burst ,",
    "this is similar to the expansion velocities measured in sn1998bw and sn2003dh .",
    "however , since this feature is quite loosely defined , this estimate can only be approximate .",
    "from the multitude of narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we can also measure the redshift to the supernova .",
    "the positions and fluxes of a number of detected narrow lines are given in table  [ t : lines ] .",
    "we derived the redshift by measuring the positions of the [ o  ii ] line , the [ o  iii ] lines as well as h@xmath49 and h@xmath50 at all 4 epochs , and conclude @xmath3 .",
    "the fluxes of the lines were measured by gaussian fits , using both idl and iraf splot .",
    "we use these below to estimate the star formation rate and the metallicity .",
    "we note that the values given in table  [ t : lines ] are averages for the four spectra corrected for e@xmath33  mag . apart from the stronger lines listed in table  [ t : lines ] , we also detect [ ne  iii ] @xmath51 , which signals the presence of ionizing radiation .",
    "this line is about 3 times weaker than h@xmath50 , although the uncertainty in such a weak line is @xmath52 in our spectra .",
    "the stronger lines have uncertainties of @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54-band sdss pre - imaging of the field @xcite allowed us to construct the optical spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy .",
    "however , it was noted @xcite that the absolute calibration of this field was not correct . to correct the sdss model magnitudes we used field star photometry @xcite , which was transformed from landolt to the sdss - system using @xcite . corrected host magnitudes",
    "were then deduced from the offsets between the sdss model magnitudes and the transformed values , giving : @xmath55 .",
    "we then used the best fit sed ( see below ) to transform these magnitudes back to landolt photometry : @xmath56mag .",
    "these are the host galaxy magnitudes used to correct the light curve parameters in sect .",
    "[ lightcurves ] .",
    "the @xmath54 host galaxy photometric points were then de - reddened by the galactic extinction following @xcite and then fitted based on the sdss filter+ccd efficiency curves @xcite and using the synthetic sed templates constructed with the hyperz code @xcite .",
    "for the construction of the synthetic templates three initial mass functions ( imfs ) were used @xcite . we also used four different extinction laws : mw @xcite , lmc @xcite , smc @xcite and one for starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed for all the templates .",
    "the redshift of the templates was fixed at @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , a wide range of star - formation histories were considered ( see more details on the @xmath57 parameter in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , creating different families of templates : elliptical , starburst , lenticular , irregular and spiral galaxies .",
    "the @xmath54-band photometric points were satisfactorily fitted by the sed templates ( @xmath58 ; see fig .",
    "[ f : sed ] ) .",
    "our sed fits did not favour any imf , extinction law or galaxy type .",
    "this means that the inferred host galaxy extinction is independent on the input model , and is stable at around @xmath59  mag .",
    "this is why we were favoring a low host galaxy extinction in sect .",
    "[ lightcurves ] .",
    "the host magnitude of @xmath60  mag , and the galactic extinction of @xmath61 gives an absolute magnitude for the host of m@xmath62 mag at the measured redshift .",
    "adopting @xmath63 this corresponds to @xmath64 .    from the h@xmath49 and [ o  ii ] lines",
    "we can estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) . from both these lines we get sfr @xmath65  yr@xmath28 , following @xcite .",
    "this is of course only measured from the part of the galaxy that falls on the spectroscopic slit .",
    "the specific star formation rate for the host galaxy of xrf060218 is thus @xmath666  m@xmath67 yr@xmath68 .",
    "finally , we can estimate the metallicity of the galaxy using the r23 technique . from the results presented in table  [ t : lines ] ,",
    "we derive a log(r@xmath69 .",
    "this indicates a somewhat sub - solar metallicity , although the exact value can not be determined from this ratio alone ( see e.g. , fig .  5 by *",
    "the luminosity and star formation rate thus indicates a small but fairly normal dwarf galaxy , similar to other nearby grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the low metallicity is also similar to that of other grb host galaxies .",
    "the spectral evolution reveals a rapidly evolving type ic supernova with very broad lines .",
    "very few type ic spectra exist for such early epochs .",
    "our first spectrum was obtained 3.7 days past the burst . the first spectrum for sn1998bw",
    "was not obtained until after a week , and for sn2003dh the emission was still dominated by the afterglow at this epoch .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to make any one - to - one comparisons of the apparent bumps in these spectra with those of other similar sne ( see e.g. , fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",

    "we have also plotted spectra for sn1998bw @xcite and sn2003dh @xcite .",
    "these spectra are very similar to the one for sn2006aj , but are taken at a later epoch .",
    "sn2006aj thus displays a fast spectral evolution .",
    "this agrees with the narrow lightcurve .      from the lightcurves , as well as from the spectral evolution",
    ", we can see that the emission is dominated by the supernova rather than by the afterglow from very early on .",
    "this is similar to sn1998bw , where no optical afterglow was ever detected , but very different from sn2003dh which was dominated by the afterglow for more than a week before it emerged .",
    "the peak magnitudes we have estimated show that sn2006aj was a fairly normal type ic supernova in that respect @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was not as bright as sn1998bw or sn2003dh .",
    "sn1998bw ejected @xmath70 of radioactive @xmath71ni ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that sn2006aj was only @xmath52 as luminous as sn1998bw thus means that sn2006aj ejected @xmath72 of radioactive @xmath71ni",
    "this is still more than seen in other broad - line supernovae , such as sne 1997ef and 2002ap .",
    "we note that the assumption that the peak magnitude scales with the nickel mass may not be valid for very asymmetric explosions @xcite .",
    "grbs are expected to be asymmetric , although they should all be pointed within a few degrees to our line of sight .",
    "the shape of the lightcurve is also of interest . for sn2006aj",
    "we have summarized the properties in table  [ t : summary ] . for comparison ,",
    "the type ic sn1994i displayed @xmath16m@xmath73 and @xmath16m@xmath74  mag .",
    "the peak magnitude for sn1994i was reached after @xmath75 days in @xmath0 , and after 10 days in the @xmath1 band @xcite .",
    "the rise time is , however , very uncertain for sn1994i ; since the exact epoch of the explosion was not observed .    for sn1998bw , @xcite estimated @xmath16m@xmath76 and @xmath16m@xmath77  mag .",
    "the peak magnitude was reached after 13.5 days in @xmath0 , and after 17 days in the @xmath1 band @xcite .",
    "this is clearly slower than observed for sn2006aj .",
    "finally , sn2002ap reached @xmath0-band maximum at about 6.2 days @xcite .",
    "this lightcurve seems to be most similar to sn2006aj in this respect . in fig .",
    "[ f : lightcurvescompare ] we compare the light curves of sn2006aj with those for sne 1994i , 1998bw and 2002ap .",
    "note that in this figure we have corrected the light curves for time dilation ( for sne2006aj and 1998bw ) and also corrected sn2006aj for the underlying host galaxy .",
    "this correction is quite substantial , in particular at late stages ( compare fig .  [",
    "f : lightcurves ] ) . the comparison in fig .",
    "[ f : lightcurvescompare ] demonstrates that sn2006aj is in fact a fast version of sn2002ap .",
    "another important aspect of grb - sne is clearly the possibility to relate the supernova shock - wave breakout with the exact time of the explosion .",
    "@xcite used the uvot instrument onboard swift to follow the uv lightcurves from the early shock break - out to the following peak due to radioactive heating ( the latter being the optical peak we are probing in this paper ) .",
    "such a shock break - out was also seen in sn1999ex @xcite and in sn1998bw @xcite . for sn1999ex",
    ", the time of shock break - out could be estimated , and the rise time in the @xmath1 band was @xmath78 days @xcite .",
    "sn2006aj has a substantially faster lightcurve , which is related to the faster expansion velocities , and possibly also to a lower ejecta mass .",
    "we note that grb060218 was a very soft burst , and thus qualifies as an ( unusual ) xrf .",
    "@xcite estimated e@xmath79  kev , at the very end of the observed distribution of peak energies . while the case for an association between long grbs and sne has been established ( see sect .",
    "[ introduction ] ) , the case is more unclear for xrfs .",
    "xrf030723 showed a very conspicuous light curve bump at @xmath80 days past burst , suggesting the presence of a fast rising supernova @xcite .",
    "in fact , doubts were raised against this interpretation since the required supernova light curve was very fast and narrow .",
    "the very fast @xmath0-band lightcurve of sn2006aj may be taken as support for the hypothesis of a sn in xrf030723 . at a cosmological redshift of @xmath81",
    "the @xmath2-band light curve bump would correspond to rest frame @xmath0 , as also noted by @xcite .",
    "more recently , xrf050824 showed a less conspicuous bump @xcite .",
    "moreover , xrf020903 has a lightcurve and spectrum consistent with a supernova at @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "these findings all argue for a common progenitor for grbs and xrfs .",
    "the situation appeared less clear as other xrfs with late - time coverage did not show clear evidence for a bright supernova bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , with xrf060218 the case for a supernova origin for such bursts is obvious .    among the many remaining questions are the lack of conspicuous afterglow emission .",
    "compared to grb030329 , the supernova emerged much faster from the afterglow for xrf060218 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there was also no conspicuous afterglow in sn1998bw .",
    "for sn2003lw ( grb031203 ) there were claims of a very faint and fast decaying afterglow @xcite .",
    "these bursts also had low values of e@xmath83 , and in fact @xcite considered 031203 to be an xrf .",
    "@xcite considered an off - axis model for xrf031203 in which this was really a normal grb although viewed from an angle of about twice the opening angle .    from fig .",
    "[ f : xrfs ] we see that it may be difficult to reconcile these diverse observations by a simple geometric scenario . in this four - field diagram",
    "we have divided bursts into xrfs and grbs .",
    "we have also divided them according to the dominating component in the optical lightcurve ; supernova or afterglow .",
    "we have indicated the spectroscopically confirmed sn - grbs .",
    "the upper left corner is represented by grb030329 where sn2003dh was not apparent until after a week .",
    "xrf020903 was dominated by an afterglow until the late supernova bump , and occupies the upper right field .",
    "the same applies to xrf030723 .",
    "the lower left box is represented by sn1998bw and grb980425 , although the peak energy was not very high .",
