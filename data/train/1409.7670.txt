    "this phantom vortex pair nucleated at the edge of the cloud and then moved towards the center , resembling mean - field vortex nucleation .",

    "the transfer of vorticity between fragments occurred on a time scale much slower ( @xmath64 ) than all other observed dynamics ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "even phantom vortices in the same fragment are found to be incoherent .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that phantom vortices are incoherent both with respect to each other and the remaining bulk density .",
    "this implies that they are distinct objects in the fragmented condensate",
    ". furthermore , phantom vortices are observable since @xmath74 is measurable via interference experiments , e.g. ref .",
    "since we analyzed a subcritical rotation , we did not detect any bulk vortices in @xmath75 . however , such vortices are routinely produced , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "we found fragmentation well before there was sufficient angular momentum to nucleate a single vortex in @xmath75 , so it is a natural question to ask whether or not the experimentally observed vortices are coherent or fragmented objects .",
    "if they are fragmented , phantom vortex cores across all relevant orbitals must coincide .",
    "our calculations show that if the coincident phantom vortices are of the same charge there must be additional phantom vortices because the fragments must maintain orthonormality , see for instance @xmath45 and @xmath40 in fig .",

    "we have observed rich vortex dynamics within individual orbitals of a fragmented single component bec .",
    "since these vortex dynamics can not be observed in the density , we termed the vortices in the fragments _ phantom vortices_. we have identified two mechanisms of phantom vortex nucleation , namely _ node mutation _ and _ slow orbital - orbital vortex transfer _ , which have no mean - field analogue . in node mutation , phantom vortices nucleate on preexisting topological defects in a fragment , whereas in slow orbital - orbital transfer , vortices are transferred between fragments .",
    "phantom vortices are clearly visible in the correlation function .",
    "a detailed analysis of the correlation function shows that phantom vortices are completely incoherent _ both _ with each other _ and _ the bulk density between other phantom vortices .",
    "phantom vortices are thus distinct quantum objects that are experimentally observable via interference experiments .",
    "we suspect that phantom vortices play an important role in the formation of the abrikosov lattice of type - ii superconductors , as well as the onset of turbulence in superfluid helium and becs .",
    "in particular , our results suggest that there would be phantom vortex dynamics well before flux - vortices are visible in the superconductor . in turn , the existence of phantom vortices in type - ii superconductors would prove the existence and importance of fragmentation in these systems .",

    "if all the particles were to occupy only the fragments , @xmath36 and @xmath40 , there would be a density vortex .    the other possibility to observe",
    "a fragmented vortex in the density is to have coincident phantom vortices of the _ same _ charge as well as noncoincident phantom vortices in regions where @xmath176 is large enough to ensure orthonormality .",

    "<S> vortices are essential to understand angular momentum in quantum systems such as superfluid helium , ultracold atomic gases , and type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of quantized vorticity in bosonic systems stimulated the development of the gross - pitaevskii mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the true dynamics of angular momentum in interacting many - body systems is enriched by the emergence of quantum correlations whose description demands a more elaborate method . </S>",
    "<S> herein we theoretically investigate the full many - body dynamics of the acquisition of angular momentum in a gas of ultracold bosons in two dimensions using a standard rotation procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of a novel mode of quantized vorticity , which we term the _ phantom vortex _ that , contrary to the conventional vortex , can be detected as a topological defect of spatial coherence , but _ not _ of the density . </S>",
    "<S> we describe previously unknown many - body mechanisms of vortex nucleation and show that angular momentum is hidden in phantom vortex modes which have so far evaded experimental detection . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is likely important in the formation of the abrikosov lattice and the onset of turbulence in superfluids .    </S>",
    "<S> quantized vortices are perhaps the most interesting way angular momentum is known to manifest in quantum many - body systems @xcite . quantized vortices appear in a variety of systems including superfluid helium @xcite , type - ii superconductors @xcite , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , and exciton - polariton condensates @xcite to name but a few . </S>",
    "<S> typically , a quantum vortex is characterized by a density node and a @xmath0 phase discontinuity . yet </S>",
    "<S> , coreless vortices have been recently created in spinor @xcite and multicomponent @xcite condensates , where the core of a vortex in one ( spin-)component is filled with the other ( spin-)component . </S>",
    "<S> however , coreless vortices have not been seen in single - component condensates . </S>",
    "<S> other known signatures of angular momentum , such as center - of - mass rotation , surface waves , and quadrupole modes for instance , are also features of the density profile  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that there exist aspects of many - body dynamics , like fragmentation @xcite , that may not be visible in the density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , the dynamics of becs are aptly treated using the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite which assumes that the many - body wavefunction is coherent and condensed for all time . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , this assumption neglects the existence of quantum correlations and precludes the possibility of fragmentation , i.e.  macroscopic occupation of more than one single particle state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , there has been much effort devoted to exploring the role of fragmentation in stationary states of bosonic systems @xcite including those with spin degrees of freedom @xcite using methods such as best mean - field theory or general variational principles . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been shown that there exist energy eigenstates with definite angular momentum that are fragmented in two dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the pioneering study of adiabatic vortex nucleation in few - body systems @xcite , it was shown that fragmentation is unavoidable . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , nontrivial dynamics involve many eigenstates , each of which is generally fragmented . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it stands to reason that a true many - body method is necessary to describe the dynamics of a two - dimensional condensate as it acquires angular momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> such a many - body generalization is the multi - configurational time - dependent hartree for bosons ( mctdhb ) @xcite method , which has been shown to accurately capture the transition from coherence to fragmentation with great success in a variety of systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the dynamics of interacting bosons in two dimensions by numerically solving the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for a standard rotation scenario using the recursive implementation of mctdhb ( r - mctdhb ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work which explores the many - body dynamics of this type of system beyond mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the system that we describe here is similar to that simulated in ref .  @xcite using the time - dependent gp equation , and analyzed experimentally in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , regions in the parameter space were established for which vortices are observed in the density . </S>",
    "<S> even though the gp treatment for the herein chosen parameter regime predicts no vortex nucleation ( supplementary information ) , the many - body analysis exhibits rich vortex dynamics that are invisible in the density . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that angular momentum in fragmented condensates manifests itself in a new type of coreless vortex , which we name the _ phantom vortex _ due to its elusive nature . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the energy eigenstates of a six - boson system in the corotating frame has shown signatures of phantom vortices ( see fig .  3 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . yet , their importance in the dynamical acquisition of angular momentum by many - body systems , even in parameter regime where no vortices nucleate in the density , has been overlooked . </S>"
