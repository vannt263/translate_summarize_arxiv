    "in wireless communications , information is transmitted in the form of waves and space is considered as the physical medium for information transfer . hence , as a physical process , waves propagate in space via line of sight or multiple paths due to reflection , diffraction and scattering by objects present in the physical environment . like any other physical phenomenon",
    ", wave propagation is governed by the laws of physics .",
    "these laws determine the process itself as well as the amount of diversity waves carry along their path .",
    "the spatial diversity of multipath influences the amount of information that can be communicated through wave propagation , thus , using spatial diversity of multipath we can ensure better system performances , including capacity improvement , high transmission rate , improved bit error rate etc . , @xcite .",
    "in effect , the study of the spatial degrees of freedom of different multiple antenna systems ( i.e. , multi - user mimo systems , distributed mimo systems , mimo cognitive radio systems etc . ) has gained renewed attention and has more recently been addressed by @xcite .",
    "this motivates to study the fundamental limits that space imposes on the degrees of freedom of band limited signals observed over finite spatial and temporal windows .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to determine the upper limit to the degrees of freedom of signals available in a band limited multipath wavefield when the wavefield is observed in , or coupled to a limited source - free region of space over a finite time window .",
    "we may assume that multiple antennas or sensors are located in the region of space to sample the observable multipath field for signal processing or communication purposes .",
    "we , however , aim to find an upper bound on the available degrees of freedom without explicitly considering a specific propagation condition , physical setup or application and thus , to show that the coupling of time and band limited multipath signals into a spatial region is fundamentally limited by a finite number of spatial modes . throughout the paper",
    ", we will frequently refer to the radius/ size of the @xmath0 multipath observation region .",
    "our derived result has great significance in a wide range of applications , including ( ) measuring the number of receive antennas required to sample a given region to maximize the performance gain , ( ) characterizing broadband beamforming techniques for next generation wireless communication to provide high quality video and audio , ( ) developing interference alignment scheme for mimo wireless networks , ( ) characterizing the degrees of freedom of distributed multi - antenna communications for broadband transmissions .",
    "we review the degrees of freedom available in spatially diverse multipath fields in different contexts .",
    "earlier works , @xcite focused on multipath fields that exhibit rich scattering and there are independent fading paths between transmitter and receiver antenna elements . according to these works , available degrees of freedom",
    "is the minimum number of transmit and receive antenna elements and channel capacity can be improvement remarkably by increasing number of the antenna elements .",
    "however , insufficient antenna spacing violates the assumption of independent fading and prevent channel capacity to increase linearly with degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the impact of fading correlation on spatially diverse multipath fields was studied by a large number of research works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards , independent works @xcite provided the characterization of the spatial degrees of freedom in multi - antenna systems as a function of the area , geometry of the antenna arrays and the angular spread of the physical environment .",
    "in addition , @xcite estimated the degrees of freedom available in source - free narrowband multipath fields observed over a spatial window and showed that the available degrees of freedom scales with the spatial dimension in terms of wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , poon et al .",
    "@xcite and franceschetti @xcite applied antenna theory and slepian s theory of spectral concentration , respectively , to derive a fundamental limit on the degrees of freedom available in a wideband multi - antenna systems for a given constraint on the area of the spatial region and observation time and defined the degrees of freedom as a product of spatial degrees of freedom and degrees of freedom of the wideband channel itself .",
    "since for wideband transmissions , space time , and frequency are strongly coupled , available bandwidth and observation time over space respectively differ from actual bandwidth and observation time depending on the available spatial information , the works of @xcite did not take this into account . in another approach , @xcite characterized multi - antenna systems in a wideband transmission regime and stated that in case of wideband frequency transmission , space and time are strongly coupled .",
    "however , how information is conserved in space - time was left as an open and important problem .",
    "the analysis in this paper considers a wideband multipath wavefield observed within a limited source - free region of space over a finite time window .",
    "the signals observable within this wavefield are studied as solutions to the helmholtz wave equation @xcite and they are encoded in infinite but countable number of orthogonal waveforms or spatial modes .",
    "this mathematical framework is similarly used in @xcite . however , in comparison , our derived result is more accurate , since we have considered the affect of available spatial information not only on the frequency bandwidth but also on the observation time .",
    "further , the degrees of freedom result provided in @xcite is derived by using a complex geometrical argument to extend the narrowband degrees of freedom result of @xcite to a broadband scenario and resulted in a loose bound .",
    "further , it is unclear , for different spatial modes , how the usable ( effective ) bandwidth varies from the given frequency bandwidth . in this work , on the contrary",
    ", the degrees of freedom result is derived in a simple manner . moreover",
    ", we clarify that at each spatial mode , how ( and why ) the observable signals are band limited within an effective frequency bandwidth rather than the given frequency bandwidth .",
    "in addition , we illustrate that beyond a certain spatial mode , the effective bandwidth becomes zero which in turn , truncates the wavefield from its infinite representation to a finite number of spatial modes .",
    "afterwards , by counting the number of spatial modes required to represent any signal within the given multipath field , we derive an analytical expression to determine the degrees of freedom of the signal wavefields and @xmath0 wavefields . ] .",
    "we depict the strong coupling relation between space and time as well as space and frequency in spatially diverse wideband multipath fields .",
    "we show that the effective observation time is fixed , independent of spatial modes , different from given observation time and essentially related to the spatial dimension of the observable region . whereas , for broadband transmissions , at each spatial mode , the observable signal is band limited within an effective frequency bandwidth , since even though the usable bandwidth at the lower spatial modes is equal to the given frequency bandwidth , for the higher modes , the usable bandwidth is less than the given frequency bandwidth .",
    "the coupling relations also indicate that for spatially diverse wideband multipath fields , the classical degrees of freedom result of _ time - bandwidth product _ can not be extended directly to the product of spatial degrees of freedom and _ time - bandwidth product _ as shown in @xcite , rather the degrees of freedom result should portray how the time and band limited signals are coupled to a limited region of space .",
    "our derived degrees of freedom result evidently portrays the impact of the coupling relations on the available degrees of freedom in spatially diverse wideband multipath fields .",
    "we also show the affect of the acceptable signal to noise ratio ( snr ) on the available degrees of freedom of each spatial mode .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem ] , the problem statement together with background on shannon s time - frequency degrees of freedom and the eigenbasis expansion of the wavefield are discussed . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present our main results , while , section [ plot ] provides graphical analysis of our derived results .",
    "next , section [ insights ] elaborates the physical insights of the main results and briefly discusses the applications .",
    "we summarize the main contributions of this paper in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider a multipath field band limited to @xmath1 $ ] and observed over a time window @xmath2 $ ] within a @xmath0 spatial window enclosed by a spherical region of radius @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath4 represents the mid band frequency .",
    "any signal sampled or recorded within this spatial region can be expressed as a function of space and time whose spectra lies within the frequency range and whose time function lies within the time interval . since it is not possible to confine any waveform in both time and frequency , we consider that the spectrum is confined entirely within the frequency range and the time function is negligible outside the time interval .",
    "+ we now express the space - time signal as    rcl ( * _ x_*,t ) = ^_-(*_x_*,)e^j t d    where @xmath5 is the fourier transform of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath7 , * _ x _ * represents a position in 3d space , such that @xmath8 denotes the euclidean distance of * _ x _ * from the origin , which is the center of the region of interest and @xmath9 . due to the band limitedness , @xmath5 is assumed to be zero outside the band @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "thus , the space - time signal can be rewritten as    rcl [ timespace ] ( * _ x_*,t ) = ^2(f_0+w)_2(f_0-w)(*_x_*,)e^jt d.    in this work , we aim to answer the fundamental question : _ given constraints on the size of the observation region , frequency bandwidth and observation time window , what is the upper bound on the degrees of freedom of signals observable within multipath wireless fields ?",
    "_    we will utilize shannon s result @xcite that provides the degrees of freedom of temporal signals for band limited communications over a single channel .",
    "shannon s result states that if the transmission is band limited to @xmath11 $ ] and limited to the time interval @xmath12 $ ] , the available time - frequency degrees of freedom is limited to @xmath13 .",
    "we provide more detailed reasoning of shannon s result in the next subsection .",
    "let us now review the reasoning behind the time - bandwidth product result @xcite . in time domain",
    "we have a wideband signal and in frequency domain this signal can be expressed as a spectrum .",
    "the mapping between these two domains is the fourier transform .",
    "the spectrum is then expanded over the frequency range with the help of fourier series expansion .",
    "this expansion represents the time domain signal by a weighted sum of orthogonal basis functions .",
    "given the signal is approximately time limited to @xmath12 $ ] and its spectrum is band limited to @xmath11 $ ] , the minimum number of terms required in the sum to satisfy both of these constraints provide the available degrees of freedom of the signal , @xmath13 .",
    "note that there may be slight discrepancy as the time domain signal obtained by the fourier series expansion over the time interval will not be strictly limited within the frequency band , rather it may contain some frequency component outside the band .",
    "however , in another approach , @xcite argued that roughly @xmath13 samples are enough to approximate any signal in energy for the best choice of a complete set of band limited functions which possess the property of being orthogonal over a given finite time interval .",
    "afterwards , the time - bandwidth product result was formalized by several authors @xcite for various other configurations .    however , shannon s result only accounts for broadband transmission over a single channel . in multipath wireless fields sampled over a region of space , spatial diversity",
    "is exploited , for instance , in mimo communications , providing several independent channels over which information can be transmitted . to account for the spatial diversity of wireless fields , we start with the spherical harmonics analysis of the wavefield observed within a region of space .",
    "we consider the space - frequency spectrum @xmath5 in as a scalar wavefield observed within a @xmath0 spherical region of finite radius @xmath3 generated by a source or distribution of sources and scatterers that exist outside the region of interest at some radius @xmath14 .",
    "hence , @xmath5 satisfies the helmholtz wave equation ( in the region of interest ) @xcite    rcl [ helmholtz ] ^2 ( * _ x _ * , ) + k^2 ( * _ x _ * , ) = 0    where @xmath15 is the laplacian , @xmath16 is the scalar wavenumber , @xmath17 is the wave velocity and @xmath18 is the angular frequency which can be expressed in terms of usual frequency @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "note that even though we only consider scalar waves , our derived results are equally valid for vector waves @xcite .    in the spherical coordinate system , the wavefield @xmath5 in",
    "can be decomposed into spherical harmonics which form an orthogonal basis set for the representation of the wavefield . using the jacobi - anger expansion @xcite and the addition theorem ( * ? ? ?",

    "the work of @xcite truncated the spherical harmonic expansion of the wavefield to a finite number of spatial modes which contain most of the energy .",
    "the number of spatial modes in the truncated expansion indicate the spatial degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the number of independent channels ) .",

    ", intuitively the available degrees of freedom of any wideband signal observed over finite spatial and temporal windows should be shannon s degrees of freedom result extended form one spatial mode to @xmath24 modes .",
    "our derived result clearly comply with this intuition .",
    "the number of modes are the number of independent channels available to receive information due to the availability of measurements over a spatial region .",
    "this means that each mode or channel has its own time - frequency degrees of freedom . spatial diversity , therefore ,",
    "provides a number of independent channels over which time - frequency information can be transmitted .",
    "* the degrees of freedom result does not agree with the well established result of evaluating degrees of freedom of spatially diverse wideband signals as a product of spatial degrees of freedom and time - frequency degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , in the propagation of waves even though space , time and frequency are separate entities , in spatially diverse wideband transmissions , space and time as well as space and frequency are strongly coupled , the results of @xcite fail to show those coupling relationships . on the contrary , our derived result takes the coupling relations in account . *",
    "shannon s work considers broadband transmission over a single channel and shows that the channel has _ `",
    "time - bandwidth product + 1 ' _ degrees of freedom . on the contrary , in addition to broadband transmission , we take spatial diversity in account . therefore , in this work , we consider broadband transmission over finite @xmath24 number of channels .",
    "our analysis indicates that each of these channels has _ ` effective time - effective bandwidth product + 1 ' _ degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that considering spatial diversity , we can capture more information from broadband transmission . for higher modes ,",
    "the effective/ usable bandwidth is less than the measured bandwidth and so not all spatial modes can covey the same amount of information . therefore , from theorem @xmath103 , for modes",
    "@xmath24 above @xmath78 , the _ ` effective time - effective bandwidth product + 1 ' _ decreases as the mode @xmath24 increases .",
    "let us consider that the threshold is equivalent to the maximum snr of the @xmath32 mode signal spectrum @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath125 .",
    "this means that signals below the frequency @xmath126 are submerged in noise and can not be detected . as a result , from we obtain    rcl[asymptotic ] d & & _ + _ + & & + _    which yields the following observations :    * for non - spatially diverse multipath fields @xmath127 , in , @xmath128 reduces to 1 , @xmath129 reduces to @xmath130 and @xmath131 becomes zero .",

    "this equation indicates that even when there is only one sample available in time domain , spatial diversity influences the amount of information that can be captured within the observable region .",
    "the derived result represents the degrees of freedom of signals observable within a broadband multipath field over finite spatial and time windows , assuming the signals are submerged in noise for frequencies less than the critical frequency @xmath126 and are not detectable .",
    "this result is consistent with shannon s time - frequency degrees of freedom result @xcite when we take sample at a single spatial point @xmath127 .",
    "further , is consistent with the degrees of result derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "44 ) at wavelength @xmath104 when we consider narrowband frequency transmissions @xmath132 .      the degrees of freedom result obtained in this paper can be used to provide insights and bounds in the following areas :    * in the context of spatial broadband communications such as wireless mimo communications , this work addresses the fundamental question of how the spatial degrees of freedom is interrelated to the time - frequency degrees of freedom .",
    "the result provides insights into gains or losses of degrees of freedom in space and time - frequency analysis . * for broadband beamforming the degrees of freedom",
    "characterises the maximum resolution that can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the greater the degrees of freedom the higher the resolution can be obtained .",
    "this has particular importance in this area since we have more variables to work with to perform broadband beamforming .",
    "the performance of beamforming in wireless networks improves with the available degrees of freedom and has been shown in @xcite . in next generation of wireless communications capable of transmitting high quality video and audio ,",
    "array gain is obtained by using broadband beamforming which exploits the spatial degrees of freedom and the effective bandwidth of each of these spatial degrees .",
    "our work shows that as more spatial degrees are exploited for beamforming , for a receive antenna occupying a limited spatial region , the effective bandwidth of the higher spatial degrees or modes @xmath24 are less than the bandwidth and decreases with the mode index @xmath24 . * for broadband reception of signals by antennas placed within a given spatial region , initially linear growth in the degrees of freedom",
    "is obtained with increasing number of antennas .",
    "once the number of antennas is greater than @xmath139 , the increase in degrees of freedom reduces with each antenna added until number of antennas is equivalent to @xmath140 .",
    "after that no gain can be obtained .",
    "this is because the wavefield constraint results in correlations between channels when the number of antennas becomes too large . *",
    "interference alignment is a promising new area introduced in the last two decades .",
    "this seeks to solve the spectrum scarcity in wireless communications by utilizing the available degrees of freedom in space , time and frequency @xcite .",
    "however , in mimo wireless networks , interference alignment uses the parallel channels in space offered by spatial degrees of freedom for alignment .",
    "our derived results can be used to develop an interference alignment scheme for mimo wireless networks .",
    "our results show that optimal signal alignment needs to consider that not all spatial channels are equal and can place interference on the spatial channels that have the lower time - frequency degrees of freedom . hence",
    ", the interference channels should be placed in the spatial channels corresponding to the higher spatial modes .",
    "further , the degrees of freedom analysis of this work provides the maximum degrees of freedom that can be utilized in these broadband communications with interference . *",
    "recently , distributed mimo communications have seen an increase in importance due to the popularity of sensor and ad - hoc networks .",
    "distributed mimo includes all muti - user communication configurations where the communications input and outputs are distributed over different users .",
    "works of @xcite have studied the spatial degrees of freedom for these considering different channel conditions and showed performance gains .",
    "these works looked at only narrowband transmissions , however , practical wireless transmissions are performed over a bandwidth .",
    "considering this , our work shows the maximum degrees of freedom available over space , time and frequency for users in a limited spherical region cooperating to receive broadband information .",
    "also , we show how the time - frequency degrees of freedom is distributed over the spatial modes .",
    "this paper provides an upper bound to the degrees of freedom of any signal observed within a band limited multipath wireless field over finite spatial and temporal windows .",
    "this upper bound is obtained characterizing the multipath field as solution to helmholtz wave equation encoded in a finite number of spatial modes .",
    "the analysis of the work shows that the effective observation time is independent of spatial modes and related to the spatial dimension of the observable region .",
    "further , for broadband transmissions , at each spatial mode , the observable signals are band limited within an effective frequency bandwidth and depending on the mode , the effective bandwidth varies from the given frequency bandwidth .",
    "these findings imply that when both spatial diversity and broadband transmissions are taken in account , space and time as well as space and frequency can not be decoupled . + the degrees of freedom result derived in this work takes the coupling relations into account and portrays the interrelation between spatial degrees of freedom and time - frequency degrees of freedom . from a spatial diversity perspective ,",
    "shannon s proposed communication model considers wideband signal encoded in only one spatial mode or one channel over which information is transmitted , the available degrees of freedom of spatially diverse wideband signal encoded in finite number of spatial modes @xmath24 is shannon s degrees of freedom result extended form one spatial mode to @xmath24 modes .",
    "this means that each mode or channel has its own time - frequency degrees of freedom .",
    "+ we also show that analogous to time , space can be treated as an information bearing object , since degrees of freedom increases sub - quadratically as the size of the observable spatial region increases irrespective of bandwidth or time window .",
    "further , the derived result portrays how the degrees of freedom is affected by the acceptable snr at each spatial mode .",
    "let @xmath47 be the inverse fourier transform of @xmath141 , then , the inverse fourier transform of is    rcl[ot ] _",
    "nm(r , t)= a_nm(t)p_n ( )    where the time domain coefficients @xmath142 are the inverse fourier transform of @xmath29 and the legendre polynomials @xmath143 are the inverse fourier transform of @xmath30 .    in , we can consider @xmath144 as the @xmath32 mode time domain signal .",
    "therefore , the @xmath32 mode space - time signal @xmath145 is a convolution between the @xmath32 mode time domain signal @xmath144 with the legendre polynomial @xmath146 . the convolution with the legendre polynomial @xmath146 represents the wavefield constraint and information content in the @xmath32 mode space - time signal @xmath145 is contained in @xmath144 .",
    "further , from the definition in @xcite , legendre polynomials @xmath143 are defined only for @xmath147 .",
    "this characteristic of legendre polynomials is also evident from fig .",
