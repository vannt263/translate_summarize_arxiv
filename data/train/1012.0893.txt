    "for a narrow pore in the presence of an external electric field , there are two dynamical phenomena that can drive dna towards / away from the pore :    * electroosmosis , and * electrophoresis .",
    "these two mechanisms can be put under the broader group of electrokinetic effects , which describe the motion of fluids and charged solutes under forces of electrostatic origin .",
    "phenomenon ( i ) is the movement of a fluid medium containing a net mobile electric charge driven by an external electric force ; for global neutrality reasons this requires the presence of fixed charged walls , as the screening cloud in the fluid constitutes the net mobile charge that couples the electric field to the fluid motion .",
    "phenomenon ( ii ) concerns the motion of a ( often , confined ) charged polymer , such as dna or rna , under an applied electric field , e.g. , gel electrophoresis , used for segregating dna by their lengths ; it describes the motion of a dna molecule through the pores of a gel under an external electric field .    in the presence of a salt gradient two further dynamical mechanisms play a role for the dna capture by the pore :    * osmosis , and * diffusiophoresis .",
    "osmosis ( iii ) is the flow of water from a low osmotic pressure to the high osmotic pressure side , i.e. , from the _ cis _ to the _ trans _ in the experiments of wanunu _",
    "et al_. osmosis through membranes that are permeable to ions is often called capillary - osmosis or diffusio - osmosis @xcite , to distinguish the mechanism from classical osmosis through a semipermeable membrane .",
    "similarly , associated with the concentration gradient of solutes is diffusiophoresis ( iv ) , which describes the movement of macromolecules in a solute concentration gradient @xcite . for both diffusiophoresis and ( diffusio )",
    "osmosis , the ions ( solutes ) must either be attracted to or repelled by the wall / macromolecule .",
    "this repulsion / attraction leads to a lateral pressure gradient in the region where the ions interact with the wall / macromolecule , driving fluid flow or movement of the macromolecule . in the main text",
    "we discuss osmosis ( iii ) and electrophoresis ( ii ) , which we find to be the dominant contributions to the enhanced dna capture rate for the particular system studied by wanunu _",
    "@xcite i.e. , electroosmosis is subdominant .",
    "below we argue that diffusiophoresis ( iv ) can also be neglected in relation to electrophoresis .",
    "the flow due to electroosmosis as driven by an electric field @xmath96 in the pore has the exact same form as the flow due to electrophoresis ( with a change of sign ) @xcite @xmath97 so when both the polymer and the pore have surface charge ( surface potential ) with the same sign , electrophoresis and electroosmosis pull the polymer in opposite directions . in the experiment by wanunu et al .",
    "@xcite the electroosmotic flow was found to be negligible compared to electrophoresis , as the pore walls was found to be nearly neutral . the diffusiophoretic flow , which relates to diffusioosmosis as electrophoresis relates to electroosmosis , is induced by the salt gradient in the _ cis _ reservoir , and pushes dna towards the pore ( as ions are net attracted to dna molecules ) . by conservation of particle",
    "current @xmath98 the gradient of the salt concentration in the _ cis _ reservoir is @xmath99 and the corresponding flow is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the diffusio - phoretic mobility .",
    "the diffusio - phoretic flow has the same dependence on @xmath63 as electrophoresis , and will therefore add to the term linear in @xmath63 in the relative capture rate ( see eq .",
    "( 15 ) in the main text ) .",
    "the ratio between the electrophoretic flow and the diffusiophoretic flow is ( from eq . and eqs .",

    "this is about one order of magnitude lower than electrophoresis and is therefore omitted in the analysis in the main text .",
    "in fig . [ fig : flow](a ) we plot the different combinations of @xmath17 and @xmath37 for different values of @xmath64 , showing resonable combinations of @xmath17 and @xmath37 for the @xmath64-regime of interest ( see main text for details ) .",
    "the slip length of surfaces are typically in the range @xmath108 nm depending among others on the contact angle and the smoothness of the surface @xcite .",
    "similarly , in fig . [ fig : flow](b ) the liquid flow profile inside the pore is plotted for different combinations of the depletion length @xmath17 and the slip length @xmath37 , with @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and all other parameters fixed to match the experiment of ref .",
    "when the slip length is larger than the pore diameter , @xmath111 , the flow profile becomes almost uniform , in contrast to the no slip case where the flow is zero near the pore walls .",
    "when @xmath17 is small compared to the pore diameter a larger slip length is needed to produce a large enough flow to explain the experimental measurements .",
    "this is because a large @xmath17 also decreases the electrophoretic motion of the dna molecules , by lowering the ion - acessible area of the pore .",
    "for the flow profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow ] , the reynolds number is @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the kinematic viscosity of bulk water .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate_enhancement_k_2 ] we plot the relative capture rate as a function @xmath2 , showing a linear dependence between the capture rate and @xmath2 .",
    "this is the exact same plot as figure 2 in the main text , however plottet in a different manner .",
    "this linear dependence stems from the osmotic flow as we predict ( see eq .",
    "( 15 ) in the main text ) , and not from electrophoresis , suggesting that the capture rate has a linear dependence on @xmath2 for weak salt gradients , and an inverse dependence for large salt gradients ( @xmath114 ) ."

    "<S> however , to understand the recently found increase in capture rate as a function of salt concentration asymmetry , it seems that a detailed description of dna molecules is not needed , since the main mechanism is the enhanced attraction of dna molecules towards the pore . </S>",
    "<S> this attraction is here shown to be made up of two main contributions : electrophoretic effects and osmotic flow . </S>",
    "<S> the capture rate with salt gradients due to electrophoretic effects @xcite and combined with electro - osmosis @xcite has been described before , however the role of ( diffusio ) osmosis has not been previously discussed . to understand the osmotic flow it is crucial to account for the repulsive interaction between kosmotropic ions and a neutral nonpolar wall . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the main physics is captured by introducing a layer near the pore wall depleted of ions . </S>",
    "<S> this also means that the osmotic flow is ion specific , and will be reversed when using salt particles that are net attracted to the pore wall . </S>",
