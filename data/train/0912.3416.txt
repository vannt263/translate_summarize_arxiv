    "for a one dimensional system of length @xmath5 , the thermal conductivity can be defined through the stationary flux of energy induced by connecting the system to two thermostats at different temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this flux of energy @xmath8 is proportional to the difference of temperature @xmath9 , and we define the thermal conductivity @xmath10 as @xmath11 if @xmath12 exists and is finite , then the conductivity is normal and the system is said to satisfy fourier s law  @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath13 is the thermal conductivity of the system .",
    "it is well known , by numerical experiments and certain analytical considerations , that the thermal conductivity diverges for one dimensional systems of oscillators with a momentum conserving dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with some experimental results on the length dependence of the thermal conductance of carbon nanotubes  @xcite . in the case of a chain of harmonic oscillators ,",
    "@xmath8 can be computed explicitly  @xcite and does not decrease when the size  @xmath5 of the system increases .",
    "this is due to the ballistic transport of energy carried by the non - interacting phonons , and it happens also for _ optical _ ( pinned ) harmonic chains , where momentum is not conserved .",
    "ballistic transport of energy is expected for all systems whose dynamics is completely integrable  @xcite , as for the toda chain  @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence shows that _ non - integrability _ ( whatever the definition of this concept one considers ) is not a sufficient condition for normal conductivity , in particular for anharmonic chains of unpinned oscillators like the fpu model  @xcite .",
    "an energy superdiffusion is expected in these momentum conserving systems , and the thermal conductivity diverges as @xmath14 , for some @xmath15 .",
    "there exists a wide debate in the physical literature about the existence or non - existence of one ( or more ) universal value of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "stochastic perturbations of the dynamics have been introduced in order to understand these phenomena .",
    "a model where langevin thermostats are attached to each oscillator in a harmonic chain was first introduced by bolsterli _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "this noise destroys all types of conservation laws , including energy , and the corresponding conductivity is finite ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for the anharmonic case ) .",
    "also , stochastic perturbations that preserve only the energy of the system give finite thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if the stochastic perturbation conserves both the energy _ and _ the momentum  @xcite .",
    "such stochastic conservative perturbations model the chaotic effect of non - linearities .",
    "these systems may then be seen as _ completely non - integrable _ , since the only conserved quantities left are the energy and the momentum . in this case , at least for harmonic interactions , the thermal conductivity can be explicitly computed by the green - kubo formula . for unpinned models , it remains finite only in dimension @xmath16 , while it diverges when @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely @xmath19 when @xmath17 , and @xmath20 when @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "analytical considerations for the same harmonic stochastic systems in non - equilibrium setting give the same results for the thermal conductivity computed according to  , see  @xcite . for anharmonic interactions ,",
    "rigorous upper bounds can be established , again by the green - kubo formula . in the one dimensional case , this leads to @xmath22 .",
    "these rigorous results motivated us to analyze the effect of stochastic perturbations on another completely integrable system , the toda chain .",
    "the thermal conductivity of toda lattices was already studied in  @xcite , where it was shown that the ballistic energy transport is destroyed for a diatomic system .",
    "in contrast with the harmonic case where many computations can be performed analytically , the nonlinear dynamics considered here has to be solved numerically .",
    "we considered a chain in the nonequilibrium steady state setting , with two langevin thermostats at different temperatures attached to its boundaries .",
    "we chose the simplest possible stochastic perturbation conserving both momentum and energy : each couple of nearest neighbor particles exchange their momentum at random times distributed according to an exponential law of parameter @xmath23 .",
    "our main results are the following :    a.   [ r1 ] as soon as some noise is present , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 , the ballistic transport is immediately destroyed ( as in the harmonic case ) and energy superdiffuses , with @xmath14 for @xmath25 ; b.   [ r2 ] the exponent @xmath4 seems to depend on the noise strength @xmath0 , and is increasing with @xmath0 .",
    "if [ r1 ] was somehow expected , [ r2 ] is quite surprising .",
    "it may be explained by the noise destroying some diffusive phenomena due to non - linearities , like localized breathers , with the result that current - current correlation decays slower when more noise is present . besides , [ r2 ] suggests that any theory claiming the existence of a universal parameter @xmath4 has to be properly circumstanced .",
