    "the cosmic rays energy spectrum extends for about eleven orders of magnitude , starting at energies below 1 gev up to energies of more than @xmath4 ev .",
    "it presents three main features : the knee , the second knee and the ankle .",
    "there is evidence of a fourth feature , the so - called gzk suppression @xcite , which is originated by the interaction of high energy protons with the photons of the cosmic microwave background . in the case of heavier nuclei ,",
    "a similar effect is expected due to the fragmentation of the nuclei in their interaction with the photons of the microwave and infrared backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the knee has been observed by several experiments @xcite at around @xmath5 ev . at this energy",
    "the spectral index changes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the kascade data shows that the composition at the knee presents a transition from light to heavy primaries in such a way that , at energies above @xmath8 ev , the composition is dominated by heavy nuclei .",
    "these particles are originated in our galaxy and what is being detected is , very likely , the end of the efficiency of supernova remnant shock waves as accelerators .",
    "the second knee has been observed at around @xmath9 ev by akeno @xcite , fly s eye stereo @xcite , yakutsk @xcite and hires @xcite .",
    "the physics of this feature is still unknown , it might be due to the end of the efficiency of supernova remnant shock waves as accelerators or a change in the diffusion regime in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the ankle is a broader feature that has been observed by fly s eye @xcite and haverah park @xcite , centered at approximately the same energy , @xmath10 ev .",
    "these results have been confirmed by yakutsk @xcite , hires @xcite and auger in hybrid mode @xcite .",
    "agasa also observed the ankle but at higher energy , around @xmath11 ev @xcite .",
    "as in the case of the second knee , the origin of the ankle is still unknown and its physical interpretation is intimately related to the nature of the former . the ankle could be the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components @xcite or the result of pair creation by extragalactic protons in the interaction with the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the precise determination of the mean chemical composition of the cosmic rays in the energy range above @xmath2 ev will allow us to understand the origin of the second knee and the ankle and to know the energy and the speed at which the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components is given @xcite .",
    "in particular , it will permit to decide among the three main models : ( i ) the mixed composition scenario @xcite , in which the composition injected by the extragalactic sources is assumed to be similar to the one of the galactic sources and in which the transition takes place in the ankle region , ( ii ) the dip model @xcite , in which the ankle is originated by the interaction of extragalactic protons with the cosmic microwave background and the transition is given at the second knee and ( iii ) a two - component transition from galactic iron nuclei to extragalactic protons , around the ankle energy @xcite .",
    "the pierre auger observatory consists of two observatories situated one in each hemisphere .",
    "the southern observatory , located in pampa amarilla close to the city of malarge , province of mendoza , argentina , currently consists of nearly 1600 cherenkov detectors placed in a 1500 m triangular grid covering an area of 3000 km@xmath12 plus four fluorescence telescope buildings , with six telescopes each , situated in the periphery of the surface array and overlooking it .",
    "the construction started in 2000 and is going to be completed early in 2008 .",
    "a complementary northern observatory will be sited in colorado , united states of america .",
    "the southern observatory , in its original design , is able to measure cosmic rays of energies above @xmath13 ev for the surface array and @xmath14 ev in hybrid mode .",
    "two enhancements , amiga ( auger muons and infill for the ground array ) @xcite and heat ( high elevation auger telescopes ) @xcite , will extend the energy range down to @xmath15 ev , encompassing the second knee and ankle region where the galactic - extragalactic transition takes place .",
    "amiga will consist of 85 pairs of cherenkov detectors and 30 m@xmath12 muon counters buried @xmath16 m underground , placed in a graded infill of 433 m and 750 m triangular grids .",
    "the amiga infill area is bound by two hexagons covering areas of 5.9 km@xmath12 and 23.5 km@xmath12 corresponding to the 433 m and 750 m arrays , respectively .",
    "the energy thresholds of the 433 m and 750 m arrays are @xmath2 ev and @xmath17 ev , respectively @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", heat will be formed by three additional telescopes of @xmath18 to @xmath19 elevation angle located next to the fluorescence telescopes building at coihueco .",
    "they will be used in combination with the existing @xmath20 to @xmath18 elevation angle telescopes at coihueco as well as in hybrid mode with the amiga infills .",
    "these enhancements will also allow detailed composition studies based on the combined measurement of the atmospheric depth of maximum shower development , @xmath21 , and the shower muon content .",
    "these two parameters are very sensitive to primary mass composition .",
    "other mass sensitive parameters , like the slope of the lateral distribution function , rise - time of the signals in the surface detectors , curvature radius , etc .",
    "strongly depend on them @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on the amiga muon detectors @xcite .",
    "these counters will consist of highly segmented scintillators with optical fibers ending on 64-pixel multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) .",
    "the scintillator strips will be equal to those used for the minos experiment @xcite .",
    "the current baseline design calls for 400 cm long @xmath22 4.1 cm wide @xmath22 1.0 cm high strips of extruded polystyrene doped with fluors , pop ( @xmath23 ) and popop ( @xmath24 ) , and co - extruded with tio@xmath25 reflecting coating .",
    "they are covered with reflective al foil . to extract the scintillation light , a wavelength shifting fiber is glued into a grove which is machined along one face of the scintillator strip .",
    "a 10 m@xmath12 module will consist of 64 scintillator strips with the fibers ending on an optical connector matched to a 64-pixel multi - anode hamamatsu h7546b pmt of 2 mm @xmath22 2 mm pixel size , protected by a pvc casing .",
    "each muon counter will consist of three of these 64-channel modules , totalling 192 independent channels covering an effective area of 30 m@xmath12 ( actually during the engineering array phase one of these 10 m@xmath12 modules from each counter will be split into two 5 m@xmath12 modules for further analyses close to the shower core ) .",
    "these muon counters will be buried alongside a water cherenkov tank .",
    "each of the 192 channels of the electronics will count pulses above a given threshold , with an overall counter time resolution of 20 ns .",
    "we also present a detailed method for the reconstruction of the muon lateral distribution function ( mldf ) from data obtained by the muon counters of the 750 m - array .",
    "an associated problem is the pile - up effect due to the finite segmentation of the muon counters .",
    "we analyse this problem and propose a correction that considerably improves the reconstruction of the mldf .",
    "the number of muons at 600 m from the shower axis , @xmath26 , is extracted from mldf fits using our reconstruction method .",
    "subsequently , the design parameters of the muon counters ( segmentation and area ) are validated by studying the impact of these parameters on the total @xmath26 uncertainty .",
    "finally , we study the mass discrimination power of @xmath26 as compared to other parameters normally used in composition analyses : the maximum development of the longitudinal profile , @xmath21 , the curvature radius of the shower front , @xmath27 , rise time of the signal at the water cherenkov detectors , @xmath28 , and slope of the lateral distribution function of the total signal deposited in the water cherenkov detectors , @xmath29 .",
    "second order effects , like multiple triggering due to electrons scattered by a single muon , will be dealt with in a subsequent work .",
    "the amiga counter electronics just counts pulses above a given threshold , without a detailed study of signal structure or peak intensity .",
    "this method is very sturdy since it does not rely on deconvoluting the number of muons from an integrated signal .",
    "it does not depend on the pmt gain or gain fluctuations nor on the muon hitting position on the scintillator strip and the corresponding light attenuation along the fiber track .",
    "neither does it require thick scintillators to control poisson fluctuations in the number of photo electrons per impinging muon .",
    "but this one - bit electronics design relies on a fine counter segmentation to prevent undercounting due to simultaneous muon arrivals .",
    "the optimum segmentation of the muon counters depends on the number of muons arriving in the time given by the system time resolution .",
    "since the mldf decreases very rapidly with the distance to the shower axis we need to determine the average position of the closest station , where pile - up is more significant .",
    "the position of the first station depends on the geometry of the array and the angular distribution of cosmic rays .",
    "we performed a simple monte carlo calculation for the @xmath30 m - array .",
    "we uniformly distributed impact points in a triangular grid with arrival directions following a @xmath31 distribution with zenith angle @xmath32 and a uniform distribution for the azimuth angle @xmath33 . for each event we obtained the distance ( along the shower plane ) between the shower core and the closest station .",
    "figure [ firstst ] shows the obtained distribution , with a mean value at @xmath34 m. therefore , we will base our subsequent studies on the number of muons found at a characteristic distance of 200 m.     m array for an isotropic incident flux of cosmic rays with @xmath35.,width=491 ]      to prevent contamination due to charged electromagnetic particles of the shower , the muon counters will be buried underground .",

    "showers initiated by iron nuclei produce more muons than those from lighter nuclei of the same energy .",
    "for that reason the simulations were performed with iron showers to take into account the most unfavorable case .",
    "we assumed 20 ns of sampling time for the system time resolution .",

    "the error in the determination of @xmath180 parameter is @xmath182 at @xmath95 ev ( energy threshold of the 750 m array ) and decreases as the energy increases , being less than @xmath183 for @xmath184",
    "so , at this energy or greater , this uncertainty is small compared with the expected primary energy uncertainty , @xmath185 , which affects directly the determination of @xmath180 since shower muon content is nearly proportional to the primary energy .",
