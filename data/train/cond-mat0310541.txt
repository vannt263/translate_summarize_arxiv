    "ductile fracture of metals commonly occurs through the nucleation , growth and coalescence of microscopic voids .",
    "@xcite much can be learned about the ductile fracture through the study of these voids .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the dynamic fracture of ductile metals ,  @xcite in which the strain rates are so high that processes such as diffusion operating on relatively long time scales may be neglected , while inertial effects become relatively important .",
    "void growth is driven by the need to relax tensile stress that builds up in the system , and to minimize the associated elastic energy .",
    "the material around a void deforms plastically in order to accommodate the void growth . naturally , the plastic deformation results from a local shear stress , which may arise from the applied stress , but it also may arise from the stress field of the void even if the applied stress is hydrostatic .",
    "so the expectation is that the evolution of the plastic zone , and hence the growth of the void , is influenced by the degree of stress triaxiality ; _ i.e. _ , the ratio of the mean ( hydrostatic ) stress to the shear stress .",
    "it is this relationship that we study here by varying the triaxiality of the loading . in particular , we conduct simulations in which one , two or three directions of the system are expanded , producing a state of uniaxial , biaxial or triaxial strain , respectively .",
    "variation in the triaxiality of the strain causes variation in the triaxiality of the stress state , where it should be noted that uniaxial ( biaxial ) strain does not imply pure uniaxial ( biaxial ) stress .    besides dynamic crack propagation experiments",
    ", dynamic fracture can be measured for instance in shock physics or spallation experiments , to which the simulations performed here are compared .",
    "various techniques are employed to generate the shock waves : hopkinson bar , gas gun , high explosives , and laser ablation . with hopkinson bar",
    "the strain - rates @xmath2 usually are of the order @xmath3/sec , in gas gun of @xmath4/sec , with high - explosives even higher strain - rates can be produced , and with lasers strain - rates exceeding @xmath0/sec are attained . in a gas gun for instance the fracture results from essentially one - dimensional shock loading .",
    "two compressive shock waves are generated by the impact of a flier on a metal target , propagate away from each other , reflect from opposite free surfaces becoming tensile release waves and finally come into coincidence again .",
    "if the combined tensile stress exceeds the rupture strength of the material , the metal fails , after some incubation time , producing a fracture surface . in strong shocks",
    ", a scab of material may spall from the back side of the target and fly off .",
    "spallation experiments  @xcite for single and polycrystal copper report spall strength values of @xmath5  gpa at strain - rates @xmath6/sec , and scaling between the spall strength and strain - rate , @xmath7 .    in this study of dynamic fracture in ductile metals at high strain - rates ( @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1/sec ) we have concentrated on void growth starting from a single crystal copper lattice containing an infinitely weakly bound inclusion or a pre - existing nanoscale void .",
    "the lattice is initially free of other defects .",
    "we have focused on the effect of stress - triaxiality on void growth . in some fracture experiments , for example in necking and cup - cone fracture ,  @xcite the uniaxial strain produces a stress state that transitions rapidly to triaxial state due to the plastic flow during the course of loading .",
    "it is during the triaxial phase that void growth and failure take place . because of the connection with shock experiments ,",
    "the stress triaxiality study done here is carried out using strain control , and it is the strain that is varied from uniaxial to biaxial to triaxial .",
    "much of the damage modeling of metals has been carried out at mean - field or continuum level based on constitutive theories .",
    "the continuum models concentrate especially on two areas : macroscopic crack growth phenomenon  @xcite and studies of porosity , _",
    "i.e. _ behavior of an array of voids , at sub - grain level during loading .",
    "@xcite in the latter area for example the locus of yield surfaces in stress space has been studied , which is related to the question of the effect of stress - triaxiality studied here . of the void growth studies especially the gurson model  @xcite",
    "is commonly used to model cavitation ( the development of porosity ) at the sub - grid level in what is termed as damage modeling .",
    "these continuum calculations often assume that the matrix material , where the voids are embedded , is elastically rigid and plastically incompressible , and the dilation of the void - matrix aggregate is completely due to the void growth . of particular interest , and relevance in terms of this study",
    ", is a single crystal plasticity study of void growth .",
    "@xcite the calculations are typically done by determining approximate solutions for integrals of incremental equations of virtual work using the finite element method .",
    "continuum modeling has been used to study some of the phenomena addressed in this paper such as the effect of triaxiality on void growth and void shape changes .",
    "@xcite the validity of the approximate solutions of incrementals limits the strain - rates to be rather low compared to the strain - rates used in this study .    in order to characterize the void growth not only with macroscopic quantities and at the continuum level , but to investigate what happens at the atomistic level , we have employed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "md simulations enable us to see what the effects are on the void surface at the single atom level , when it grows while the total system yields .",
    "this article presents work , which is an extension to the work done earlier by some of this article s authors of void growth in a single crystal copper with hydrostatic loading , void nucleation and growth in single and polycrystalline copper .",
    "@xcite molecular dynamics simulations of void growth in single crystal copper have also been conducted by other groups for slab geometries of interest in the semiconductor chip metalization problem .",
    "@xcite the effectively two - dimensional , thin film systems are in contrast to three dimensional bulk systems studied here . in some cases md simulations of plasticity and",
    "crack propagation have been as large as billion atoms .",
    "@xcite    this article is organized as follows .",
    "it starts in section  [ method ] with an overview of the md method used and the simulations which have been carried out in this study .",
    "exploration of the results of the simulations starts in section  [ stressstrain ] by the study of the mean or hydrostatic stress versus strain as well as the deviatoric part of the stress tensor , von mises stress , which is used to measure the shear stress , and stress - triaxiality versus strain for all the simulated strain - rates and modes of expansion .",
    "section  [ plasticstrain ] concentrates on the macroscopic plastic quantities , such as mean and equivalent plastic strain , plastic work and its relation to the temperature .",
    "the evolution of the void in terms of its growth and shape changes is studied in section  [ voidevol ] .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes the results and compares different measured quantities with each other concentrating on one of the simulations , uniaxial strain with strain - rate @xmath8/sec .",
    "the article is concluded with discussions of the results and suggestions for future studies in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "in this atomistic - level study of void growth , the simulations have been done using empirical embedded - atom ( eam ) potentials in classical molecular dynamics  @xcite following the scheme developed earlier .",
    "@xcite the copper eam potential we have used is due to oh and johnson .  @xcite    the system , in which the simulations are done , is a three - dimensional single - crystal face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice in a cubic box with @xmath9 faces .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in all the three directions so that there are no free boundaries in the system apart from the void .",
    "equivalently the system can be imagined to consist of an infinite periodic array of voids .",
    "note that periodic boundary conditions have also been used in continuum models of void growth , but in the continuum modeling of void growth in isotropic materials the calculations are done in a reduced cell , which exhibits one quarter of the box in two dimensions , and one eighth in three dimensions , and the behavior of other areas are derived from the symmetries .",
    "we use the full cubic box because the cubic symmetry present in the continuum is broken in md at finite temperature , and processes such as dislocation nucleation at the void surface would be over - constrained in a reduced simulation box .    in the simulations ,",
    "the system is brought to thermal equilibrium at room temperature , @xmath10  k , with a commonly used thermostat  @xcite and at ambient pressure , @xmath11  mpa , keeping the volume constant .",
    "after that a spherical void is cut in the middle of the system , later the thermostat is turned off , and the dilational strain is applied uniformly with a constant strain - rate @xmath2 .",
    "the removal of the atoms in the spherical region may be considered to simulate the instantaneous separation of the matrix material from an infinitely weakly bound inclusion .",
    "the uniform expansion in these strain - controlled simulations is applied through rescaling the coordinates as in the parrinello - rahman method .",
    "@xcite technically the three cartesian coordinates of the atoms are rescaled to the unit - box , each coordinate @xmath12 . when calculating the forces and velocities , as well as updating the new positions of the atoms , the unit - box is multiplied by a diagonal scaling matrix @xmath13 , where @xmath14 s are the simulation box s side lengths , to compute the true positions of the atoms , @xmath15 this scaling matrix @xmath16 is updated each time - step , when the load is applied , by multiplying the initial matrix @xmath17 with the sum of the unit matrix and the strain matrix @xmath18 , @xmath19 for our purposes the strain - rate matrix @xmath20 is always diagonal , since neither rotation nor simple shear type strains are studied . in the triaxial case",
    "all the terms in the diagonal are equal ; in the uniaxial there is a single non - zero term ; and in the biaxial case two of the three diagonal terms differ from zero and are equal .",
    "prior to expansion the system is cubic , its scaling matrix @xmath17 is diagonal , and all the terms are equal and correspond to the equilibrium size at ambient pressure .",
    "hence the scaling matrix @xmath16 remains diagonal throughout the simulation , and the strain in each case is in a @xmath21 direction .    in fracture and plasticity simulations the first quantity to consider is the stress - strain behavior . with the strain as an input parameter , here we have to measure the stress .",
    "in this study of the stress - triaxiality we are interested in both mean and shear stresses . therefore the whole stress tensor @xmath22 is needed .",
    "the stress tensor ( the negative of the pressure ) can be calculated atomistically on each time - step using the virial formula :  @xcite @xmath23 the first term in the stress tensor is the kinetic contribution of atoms denoted with @xmath24 and having masses @xmath25 and momenta @xmath26 .",
    "the second term , a microscopic _ virial _ potential stress , consists of sums of interatomic forces @xmath27 of atom pairs @xmath28 with corresponding distances @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted , that here and in the rest of the article @xmath24 and @xmath30 denote the atoms , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 the cartesian coordinates .",
    "note that the thermal stress is included , although in practice in these simulations it contributes less than 1 gpa , less than 10% of the yield stress value , and never dominates the changes in stress .      typically in the simulations carried out here , the cube consists of 60 fcc unit cells in each direction , giving 864  000 atoms .",
    "the equilibrium side - length of such a copper system is @xmath33  nm at room temperature and ambient pressure . the radius of the spherical void cut from the system , unless otherwise noted , is 0.1 of the side - length of the box ; thus @xmath34  nm . after the void is cut , there are 860  396 atoms in the system .    the relatively inexpensive potential used enables us to do extensive simulations in time .",
    "a single time - step takes typically about 40 sec of cpu - time in a system with 864  000 atoms in a linux workstation with intel xeon 1700mhz processor .",
    "the longest calculation required 835  050 time - steps corresponding to 5.6  nanoseconds .",
    "the time - step was @xmath35 femtoseconds .    as mentioned earlier , in order to study the effects of the stress - triaxiality and different modes of expansion on the void - growth , we have applied three different types of expansion , namely uniaxial , biaxial , and triaxial .",
    "the strain - rates used for each of the three modes of expansion are @xmath36/sec , @xmath37/sec , @xmath38/sec , @xmath8/sec , and @xmath0/sec . for the lowest strain - rate ,",
    "the md code was parallelized in order to take advantage of massively parallel computers .",
    "the parallelization was done using a spatial domain - decomposition , and was shown to scale nearly linearly up to 128 processors .",
    "the parallel code was used in the case with 835  050 time - steps mentioned above , for example .    for comparison in the elastic regime",
    ", we have also performed simulations without a void in all three modes of expansion .",
    "these simulations have been used to determine the bulk , elastic stress - strain response of the eam copper and hence the elastic constants . without a void ,",
    "the system is not so strain - rate and system size dependent , at least up to the point of failure , so the so - called `` no void '' simulations have been performed with a smaller system size , 45 fcc - cells in each direction ( 364  500 atoms ) and at the single strain - rate @xmath39/sec . a uniaxial study of the 60@xmath40 system size , but with a smaller initial void radius of @xmath41  nm , was carried out with the strain - rate @xmath42/sec in order to study the void - size dependence . in this case",
    "the system with the void contains 863  543 atoms .",
    "it should be mentioned , too , that all of the intermediate strain - rate simulations ( @xmath43/sec and @xmath38/sec ) expansion were not started from equilibrium conditions at @xmath44  mpa , but from systems expanded previously at the strain - rate @xmath39/sec .",
    "these simulations have been restarted well before yielding , when the system s behavior is rate independent , and relaxed for 2000 time - steps , or 13.4 picoseconds , without expansion before continuing the expansion at the intermediate strain rates .",
    "the energy is conserved during the relaxation in md simulations .",
    "these restarts have been accomplished at strain values @xmath45  % , @xmath46  % , and @xmath47  % in uniaxial , biaxial , and triaxial cases , respectively .",
    "let us begin to explore the results of the md simulations by looking at the stress - strain curves . figure  [ fig1 ] shows these curves for each of the modes of expansion at all the strain - rates computed .",
    "the data from `` no void '' cases are also plotted .",
    "the mean or hydrostatic stress , @xmath48 is plotted to indicate the principal impetus for void growth .",
    "note that the strain is the _ engineering strain _",
    ", defined as the expanded system size divided by the original system size minus one . in the uniaxial and biaxial cases the strains are the principal strain values @xmath49 in the direction of the strain , such as @xmath50 , @xmath51 in the uniaxial case , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 in the biaxial case .",
    "hence the strain is the value of a non - zero diagonal term of @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_update ] ) .",
    "the mean strains @xmath55 are 1/3 and 2/3 of the plotted uniaxial and biaxial strains , respectively .",
    "thus the total volumetric strain - rates are not the same in the different expansion modes . in the triaxial cases",
    "the plotted and the mean strain values are the same .",
    "the shape of the stress - strain curves do not differ much depending on the modes of expansion in these cases , at least when plotted versus mean strain .",
    "independent of the strain - rate , and whether with or without a void , the stress - strain curves lie essentially on top of each other during elastic expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the initial smooth behavior when the system is still recoverable and has not deformed plastically .",
    "the stress - strain curve starts to deviate from the trend of the elastic behavior at a specific , `` critical '' point which we call here a _",
    "yield point_. in other quantities we measure a change in behavior happens at a specific point , too , and as we shall see later the critical or yield points mostly coincide with each other , _ i.e. _ , their strain values are approximately the same independent of from which quantity we derived it .",
    "the same point is also the one when the void starts to grow , which is the primary mechanism for plasticity in this study .",
    "here we define numerically the yield point of the cases with void by comparing their stress - strain curves with the reference `` no void '' curve , which behaves elastically beyond the yield points of the other cases [ cf .",
    "[ fig1](a ) inset ] .",
    "ultimately the no void case does fail by homogeneous nucleation of voids , and this is the reason for the drop in the mean stress .",
    "there is a small offset between cases with a void compared to the case without a void due to the elastic relaxation of the void .",
    "the value of the stress at the yield point in the cases with void is lower with lower strain - rate , and thus the strain to yield is also lower . in each of the modes of expansion , the stress at the yield point for the strain - rate @xmath56/sec is close to the value to which the higher strain - rates converge .",
    "of course , at much lower strain rates the physics changes , new mechanisms become active , so this value need not hold for arbitrarily low strain rates . however , it is noteworthy that the stress at the yield point is not scaling with strain , contrary to the experimental finding for the spall strength explained in section  [ intro ] .",
    "overshooting , the phenomenon that the maximum stress is much higher than the stress at the yield point , is evident here for the higher strain rates .",
    "the scaling of the spall strength versus the strain - rate  @xcite with an exponent 0.2 is reproduced here when one compares the maximum stress values instead of the stresses at the yield point for strain - rates @xmath57/sec , @xmath37/sec , and @xmath1/sec , since then the exponent is @xmath58 , lowest for the uniaxial case and highest for the triaxial case . on the other hand the stress value at the yield point , which is at the same time the maximum stress , when @xmath56/sec is very close to the value of 6 - 8  gpa the spall strength scaling predicted from the lower strain - rates mentioned in section  [ intro ] .",
    "it should be noted also , that since we are limited to finite , fairly small , system sizes , at late stages of the stress - strain curves , at the failure , the data is not realistic anymore .",
    "the reason is that at the plastic part of the stress - strain behavior when the void grows , it also emits dislocations , and in a finite system with periodic boundaries , when the dislocations have traveled long enough , they propagate through the boundaries and reenter from the other side . in the picture where we have a periodic array of voids in an infinite system",
    "this means that the voids are so close to each other that they start to interact . in reality voids",
    "are never arranged in a perfect cubic lattice structure and in symmetric positions with respect to each other , and thus the interactions of the voids in the simulations with their periodic images are just an unphysical finite size effect .    in the shear stress or",
    "more precisely in the deviatoric part of the stress tensor @xmath59 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a much bigger difference is seen between the modes of expansion than in the mean stress . for the deviatoric part of the stress",
    "@xmath59 we use _ von mises stress _ : @xmath60^{1/2 } , \\label{eq_misesstress}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the second invariant of the stress deviator @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite thus von mises stress reads : @xmath63^{1/2 } \\\\ & = & \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\alpha > \\beta } ( \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha }   -   \\sigma_{\\beta \\beta})^2 + 3 \\sum_{\\alpha > \\beta }   \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}^2 \\right]^{1/2}. \\end{array } \\label{eq_misesstress2}\\ ] ] while the mean stress at the yield point gets a value of about @xmath64  gpa when loaded with strain - rate @xmath65/sec in each of the three modes of expansion , von mises stress has a value of @xmath66  gpa and 0.7  gpa in the uniaxial and biaxial cases , respectively . in the triaxial case",
    "it should be zero by symmetry , and the difference from zero , representing symmetry - breaking effects , is small .",
    "thus the loading differences between the modes of expansion are quantified in von mises stress .",
    "after the onset of plasticity or the void growth , von mises stress gets a value of about @xmath67  gpa , 0.2  gpa , and 0.1  gpa , in the uniaxial , biaxial , and triaxial cases , respectively , independent of the strain - rate , but with significant fluctuations in this regime . in this period",
    "also dislocations move under the action of the shear stress until the stress has dropped to the point that it is no longer sufficient to move a dislocation through the forest of dislocations .",
    "the final value of the shear stress corresponds to the flow stress , and they are close to the tensile strength values of copper , 200 - 400  mpa , quoted in the literature .",
    "@xcite    although von mises stress captures differences between the loading modes quite well , an even better quantity to study is the ratio between hydrostatic and shear stresses , the _ stress - triaxiality _",
    "@xmath68 which has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the uniaxial case",
    "the stress - triaxiality starts from the value @xmath69 and slowly decreases linearly to a value @xmath70 until the onset of rapid growth at the yield point .",
    "after the rapid increase the stress - triaxiality saturates at @xmath71 .",
    "the stress - triaxiality in the biaxial case starts with a much larger value than in the uniaxial case .",
    "it begins at @xmath72 and increases linearly to a value @xmath73 at the yield point where it grows rapidly to a value of @xmath74 .",
    "we have noted the correspondence of the final von mises stress and the flow stress above . similarly the spall strength provides an experimental measure of the mean stress that can be supported in void growth .",
    "thus the stress - triaxiality values can be compared with the ratio of the spall and the tensile strength of copper .",
    "previously quoted literature values for them are 6 - 8  gpa and 200 - 400  mpa , respectively , giving for their ratio values between 15 and 40 , and thus comparable with the stress - triaxiality values here .",
    "the comparison is not fully rigorous , but it provides an indication of how reasonable the final stress triaxiality values are in terms of experiment . since the stress - triaxiality is the mean stress divided by von mises stress , which is equal to zero in the triaxial case until the yield point and very small even after that , the stress - triaxiality is diverging and therefore not plotted here in that case . the stress - triaxiality values in the uniaxial and biaxial cases at the elastic part of the simulation",
    "is compared here also with the values one get from the elasticity theory :  @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 in the uniaxial case and @xmath77 in the biaxial case .",
    "the literature values for the elastic constants of copper are @xmath78 168  gpa and @xmath79 121  gpa .",
    "@xcite thus @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the uniaxial and biaxial cases , respectively , which compare quite well with the simulations presented here . when the elastic constants are derived from the stress - strain curves as @xmath82 , they are close to the actual experimental values : @xmath83 162  gpa , @xmath84 121",

    "the shapes of the stress - strain curves are so much rounded due to over - shooting , that there is no clear point , where the stress - strain curve deviates from the elastic behavior , and thus our definition of the yield point is no longer suitable . in comparing the mean strain values @xmath55 ( as in the table ) at the onset of plasticity for a particular strain rate ,",
    "one finds that the uniaxial expansion always starts to yield at the least strain , and the hydrostatic expansion , at the greatest strain .",
    "there are two effects that contribute to the increase in the plastic threshold as the triaxiality increases .",
    "first , the shear component of the applied stress contributes to the resolved shear stress and lowers the threshold for heterogeneous nucleation of dislocations at the void surface .",
    "@xcite and second , the volumetric strain - rate is lowest in the uniaxial case and the highest in the hydrostatic case .",
    "strain - rate hardening then leads to an increase in the stress value at the onset of plasticity as the triaxiality increases .",
    "the difference between the critical strain values when defined as when a behavior deviates from the elastic behavior is nearly negligible and thus independent of whether one uses the criterion from the hydrostatic stress , von mises stress or stress - triaxiality curves .",
    "the differences reflect mainly the difficulties in defining the point what we call the yield point .",
    "however , we will see later that if the mean stress and von mises stress start to deviate from the elastic behavior with the same ratio as they have during elastic expansion , the stress - triaxiality may deviate a bit later than the other quantities .",
    "we shall see later , too , that the onset of plasticity defined from these quantities is very close to where the void starts to grow .",
    "after sufficient expansion , the system yields and the mean stress is observed to drop with respect to the elastic response .",
    "then as the simulation box continues to expand , the stress remains roughly constant until the precipitous drop at final failure . in the region of increasing strain but roughly constant mean stress ,",
    "most of the strain is in the form of plastic strain , a macroscopic measure of the plastic , permanent and irrecoverable deformations in the system . in this section",
    "we study the macroscopic quantities of plasticity such as mean and equivalent plastic strains as well as the plastic work , and in the next section in more detail what are the actual plastic deformations visible in the void .",
    "the concomitant dislocations related to void s shape and volume changes are studied elsewhere .",
    "@xcite    in deriving the plastic strain here it is assumed that the tetragonal symmetry is approximately preserved and thus the off - diagonal terms of the stress tensor are negligible . following the literature we separate the strain increment @xmath88 into elastic and plastic parts .",
    "@xcite thus by definition the plastic strain increment becomes @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the total increment of the strain .",
    "below we use @xmath2 instead of @xmath91 since @xmath92 can be divided from both sides of eq .",

    "the elastic compliance tensor @xmath95 is retrieved from the elastic part of the stress - strain curve of the cases without the void as follows .",
    "due to the nonlinearity of a stress - strain curve we have not only retrieved the slope of it , which would give @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the bulk modulus , but fitted a fourth order polynomial to the strain versus stress curve , whose derivative gives us @xmath98 .",
    "this is done separately for the uniaxial , biaxial , and triaxial no - void cases , and the respective curves are used for the cases with the void .",
    "it should be mentioned , too , that in the derivation of the bulk modulus the mean total logarithmic strain is used instead of the engineering principal strain used in the plots of this article .",
    "similarly the term @xmath99 is derived using a fourth order polynomial in the mean strain versus von mises stress curve giving @xmath100 .",
    "note , that when @xmath101 is derived from the plot using mean strain there are prefactors 1/3 and 2/3 for @xmath102 in the uniaxial and biaxial cases , respectively .",

    "one sees that after the yield point the mean plastic strain first increases roughly exponentially , although the region is too small to be definitive , and thenceforth roughly linearly .",
    "note that the mean plastic strain is not the equivalent plastic strain commonly used in plasticity , which will be defined below , but a measure of the porosity .",
    "this will be studied in the next section , where the mean plastic strain will be compared with the growth of the volume of the void .",
    "we turn now to the quantification of the dislocation flow , conventionally computed at the continuum level as the second invariant of the deviatoric plastic strain , the _ equivalent plastic strain_. typically in the case of tetragonal total strain , the equivalent plastic strain rate would be calculated as : @xmath116 the equivalent plastic strain is calculated in turn as @xmath117 in practice this formula for the equivalent plastic strain is problematic in md for several reasons .",
    "first , the time and length scales in md are much shorter than those assumed in continuum formulations of plasticity .",
    "the time scale is a problem because dislocation flow becomes partially reversible at short enough time scales .",
    "thermal fluctuations cause reversible oscillations of dislocations and fluctuations in the local elastic strain . to the contrary , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq_equivalent_t ] ) is positive definite , as appropriate for plastic deformation that is cumulative even when reversed . in practice",
    ", the application of eq.([eq_equivalent_t ] ) in md gives a result dominated by the fluctuations for small time increments ; in fact , in our attempt to apply the formula to the md deformation every 10 time steps , the contribution of the fluctuations was 22 times as large as the applied total mean strain ( these values are obtained from the biaxial case with strain - rate @xmath43/sec ) . the formula must be modified to be insensitive to thermal fluctuations .",
    "second , the formula for the equivalent plastic strain assumes isotropic plasticity in the following sense . in isotropic plasticity",
    ", the plastic flow is driven by the shear stress quantified by the von mises stress .",
    "the equivalent plastic strain is conjugate to the von mises stress , and therefore takes on a particular signficance in the theory .",
    "implicit is the assumption , for example , that slip systems that experience the same shear stress will exhibit the same plastic strain .",
    "this assumption is violated in md for two reasons . once again",
    ", the thermal fluctuations may cause the initiation of flow on one glide system before that on a symmetrically related system .",
    "this effect is observed in our md simulations .",
    "typically the symmetry is restored after a brief period , but because the plastic strain is cumulative , the symmetry breaking fluctuation is never eliminated from the plastic strain ( [ eq_equivalent_t ] ) .",
    "second , a more mundane reason the assumption of isotropy fails is that the single crystal systems are anisotropic , both because of the specific glide planes involved and because of the elastic constants , especially in copper .    it may be possible to rectify these problems while retaining the basic formulation of the equivalent plastic strain , for example through a suitable multi - resolution calculation of the integral ( [ eq_equivalent_t ] ) .",
    "we have made several attempts at a new formulation , but we were not able to develop a satisfactory algorithm , providing a meaningful measure of the plastic strain on md time scales based on the equivalent plastic strain integral ( [ eq_equivalent_t ] ) .",
    "we found that we could eliminate the anomalies due to fluctuations or the anisotropy , but not both simultaneously in a robust manner .",
    "we have therefore turned to a different quantification of the plastic strain .",
    "certainly , the full deviatoric plastic strain tensor is a measure of the plastic flow , conjugate to the deviator stress .",
    "its rate of increase is given by the traceless part of eq .",
    "( [ eq_plastic ] ) .",
    "typically , the rate would be integrated in a cumulative fashion , but we will not do so .",
    "the nature of our simulations is such that at the continuum level plastic flow is only expected in one direction , so any sign reversal may be attributed to fluctuations .",
    "we then calculate @xmath118 where the plastic strain rate is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_plastic ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again that no absolute value is taken , so fluctuations cancel .    then in order to have a scalar quantification of the plastic strain , we compute the @xmath119 invariant , normalized as the equivalent plastic strain would be : @xmath120 we must stress that this quantity is not equal to the equivalent plastic strain commonly used in plasticity , except in the extraordinary case of monotonic isotropic plasticity .",
    "it is not conjugate to the von mises stress , for example , in our md simulations .",
    "nevertheless , it is a useful qualitative measure of the degree of plasticity , and it allows us to compare the plastic response as the system is loaded in different ways and we call it here _ equivalent plastic strain _ for simplicity .    the evolution of the equivalent plastic strain during uniaxial and biaxial expansion is plotted in fig .  [ fig5 ] . in the triaxial case",
    "it is essentially zero , as expected by symmetry , and therefore it has not been plotted . in practice ,",
    "the stress during triaxial expansion has only a negligibly small fluctuating shear component , so the calculated elastic shear strains are very small , too .",
    "since neither the box strain nor the elastic strain has an appreciable shear component , the equivalent plastic strain is found to be zero .",
    "now , once the tensors for both the stress and the plastic strain are derived , ( actually only the diagonal terms of the plastic strain are needed ) , the plastic work can be calculated , @xmath121 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "it should be compared with the temperature from the same simulations , fig .",
    "note , that in these simulations , when the dilational strain is applied , the thermostat is turned off and thus the temperature is allowed to change .",
    "first the system cools in the elastic regime due to adiabatic cooling on expansion , but when plastic deformations begin , work is done in the system resulting in heating .",
    "we find that the increase in plastic work does not match exactly with the temperature . in principle",
    "we expect several effects to contribute to this difference : the surface energy of the void , the defect formation energies for dislocations and point defects , further adiabatic cooling , and any error in calculating the elastic energy or strain from the stress . using the best data available to bound the contributions from surface , defect and adiabatic cooling energies",
    ", we find that there remains an energy deficit that we attribute to an error in the calculated elastic energy .",
    "the error comes from the use of the average stress despite stress inhomogeneity in the system due to the void : in the plastic work the product of plastic strain and stress is calculated with averaged quantities , while in the temperature the product is calculated at level of each atom and averaged afterward .",
    "we now consider the volume and shape evolution of the void . during the md simulations undergoing expansion , the surface of the void",
    "is determined by finding individual atoms that belong to the surface .",
    "this is done by creating a fine two - dimensional mesh , in which each mesh point corresponds to spherical angular coordinates @xmath122 .",
    "an atom is found to represent the surface at each point of the mesh , with some atoms representing multiple mesh points . in particular , taking the origin to be the center of the void , within the solid angle associated with each mesh point , the atom that is closest to the origin is defined to be the surface atom at that mesh point .",
    "there are , however , some uncertainties related to this method .",
    "if the mesh is too dense with its size diverging it can capture almost all the atoms in the system .",
    "on the other hand if it is too sparse , it may neglect some surface atoms , especially when void is anisotropic , non - spherical , and has some sharp edges in it .",
    "therefore we introduced a width to each of the atoms by drawing a circle around it that implies a width @xmath123 to the angles , so that one atom can occupy several mesh points in a fine mesh .",
    "we have typically 75 - 100 points for each angular coordinate , giving a total of 5625 - 10000 mesh points . in the surface of the void",
    "there are typically few thousand atoms .",
    "besides introducing the width to the atoms , we also select atoms based on their radial distance : if an atom has much larger radial distance @xmath124 compared to its neighbors it is neglected in order not to capture atoms that do not belong to the surface .",
    "once the surface atoms are identified , the surface is tessellated using a generalization of the delaunay triangulation method .",
    "@xcite the delaunay triangulation is an optimal triangulation of a collection of points  in our case atoms  on the plane .",
    "it is optimal roughly in the sense that the aspect ratio of the triangles is as near to unity as possible ; more precisely , the delaunay theorem guarantees that there is a unique ( up to degeneracy ) triangulation such that if any triangle in the triangulation is circumscribed by a circle , none of the other points will be in the interior of the circle . the delaunay theorem , as formulated ,",
    "does not apply to points on a curved surface .",
    "in fact , there appears to be a topological obstruction to the existence of a unique , optimal triangulation on a closed surface when the euler character is non - zero .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to extend the delaunay triangulation algorithm to achieve a locally optimal triangulation almost everywhere .",
    "the approach we have taken is to project the points patchwise onto flat surfaces . in particular ,",
    "stereographic projections are used to project the upper and lower hemispheres separately onto planes .",
    "cylindrical coordinates are used to project the equatorial region to a cylinder .",
    "the delaunay algorithm is used to triangulate each of these projected regions .",
    "the patches overlap at latitudes of @xmath125 where the projections are not too distorted .",
    "the three patches are sewn together using a simple advancing front triangulation at the boundaries .    using this triangulation ,",
    "the volume of the void can be calculated precisely by summing up the volumes of the tetrahedra with one apex at the center of the void and the opposing face on the void surface .",
    "as we shall see below , the void shape evolves to be far from spherical .",
    "therefore the approximation of the void surface by triangles captures the shape better than just assuming it to be spherical and using only the solid angles and radial distances of a sphere , when calculating the volume of the void .",
    "an advantage of this method is that if some atom , which should be taken into account , is missing from the surface of the void , its position is filled with the triangles created by its neighboring atoms , and thus the `` hole '' is well approximated by its neighbors .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the porosity or the ratio between the volume of the void and the total volume of the system , @xmath126 is plotted for a fraction of the simulations of the strain - rates @xmath36/sec , @xmath37/sec , @xmath38/sec , and @xmath8/sec .",
    "it should be noted that in order to get information about the positions of the atoms for the strain values of the interest ( _ i.e. _ , close to and after the onset of plasticity ) the calculations were restarted from already expanded system .",
    "after the restart the expansion was applied with the same strain - rate as earlier but now to the already expanded system , thus the strain - rate was increased by a few percent compared to the original [ since @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_update ] ) was the restart value ] .",
    "therefore these simulations are not precisely comparable with the ones plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig7 ] , where the continuum quantities are shown . in these plots , as for the mean plastic strain , in most cases first the void grows exponentially and then ( if the calculation has been carried out that long ) it changes to a linear growth , see especially fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) and the strain - rates @xmath37/sec and @xmath128/sec there .",
    "the cross - over to the linear growth happens at the same point as the rate of decrease of the mean stress slows .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this article to go into the analysis , the reduction in the growth rate coincides with the point at which the dislocation density along the shortest distance between the void and its periodic image ( at the apices of the faceted void , cf.section  [ voidshape ] ) reaches saturation , and the nature of the dislocation activity changes dramatically .",
    "this can be interpreted as a finite size effect as the void approaches the boundary of the simulation box or as a start of the coalescence process of the void with its own periodic image .",
    "the void - void interactions and the coalescence process of two voids in a less restrictive geometry will be presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the shapes of the porosity curves as a whole can be compared with the mean plastic strain plotted in fig .",
    "although the volume of the void is not calculated throughout the whole simulation , one sees easily , that there is correspondence between mean plastic strain and the volume of the void .",
    "there is of course an offset at the elastic part of the simulations , since mean plastic strain equals zero then , but the initial volume of the void is finite .",
    "the correspondence will be revisited and studied more carefully in section  [ summary ] .",
    "however , it can be concluded already here that the macroscopic quantity mean plastic strain captures the microscopic behavior of the void growth very well .",
    "effects such as the excess volume associated with defects are negligible .",
    "this also means that the matrix material is plastically incompressible , the dilation comes from the void growth , and thus it is consistent with the gurson type of continuum models .",
    "@xcite      let us now look at the shape evolution of the void in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] snapshots of the void are shown from uniaxial expansion at the strain - rate @xmath43/sec .",
    "there are several interesting aspects in the snapshots . in the first two snapshots at strains @xmath129 and @xmath130 when the system still behaves elastically , the void is expanded in the @xmath131-direction , which is the direction of the strain . however , after that the void makes a rapid shape change and becomes more extended in the transverse @xmath132 and @xmath133-directions , _ i.e. _ , the strain - free directions , than @xmath131-direction .",
    "this prolate - to - oblate transition may be counterintuitive , but the behavior has been observed previously in continuum calculations,@xcite and it has been related to the appearance of shallow dimples in the fractography studies of ductile fracture surfaces in low triaxiality conditions .",

    "does appear in both our simulations and the viscous solid model of budiansky _",
    "et al_. following some additional expansion beyond the transition , the void begins to become faceted , as visible in the last three snapshots .",
    "it should be mentioned that the anisotropy visible in this uniaxial case is less pronounced in the biaxial case .",

    "[ fig9](f ) , becomes more pronounced .",
    "@xcite the octahedral shape has been seen in spallation experiments in the fcc metal aluminum,@xcite and also in experiments on the equilibrium void shape of another material , silicon , too , where it has been used to calculate anisotropic surface energies through an inverse wulff construction .",

    "these borderline atoms can appear intermittently on the void surface during the growth , and the tessellation is used to minimize their effect on the moments . in calculating the volume of the void the triangulation gave one face of the tetrahedra that acted as small volume elements for the total volume . here",

    "the octahedral shape measured by the @xmath162 is more pronounced in the biaxial and triaxial cases than in the uniaxial case as explained qualitatively earlier .",
    "hence we find that the multipole moments introduce a good method to measure the shape changes of the void .",
    "the non - zero values for @xmath163 , as well as @xmath161 in other cases than uniaxial , indicate that the void is not ( cubically ) symmetric in these simulations .",

    "_    the evolution of the void and the system s stress - strain behavior can be divided in three or even four different regions .",
    "the first region is when the system expands elastically .",
    "the mean and von mises stresses increase smoothly , nearly linearly , and the stress - triaxiality stays nearly constant . through the elastic region",
    "the void volume fraction remains nearly constant , too .",
    "it is not exactly constant , since due to the free surface of the void , the elastic expansion is a bit greater at the surface of the void compared to the total system .",
    "trivially the mean and equivalent plastic strains as well as the plastic work are equal to zero in the elastic region , and temperature decreases in the system .",
    "the quadrupole moment has a non - zero value because of the elongation in the direction of the strain .",
    "the second region begins at what we call the yield point , _ i.e. _ , the onset of rapid growth of the void facilitated by plastic deformation .",
    "heterogeneous nucleation of dislocations at the void surface is the primary mechanism for plasticity in the simulation , and thus it is at this point that the measured quantities start to deviate from their elastic behavior .",
    "the mean stress begins to plateau here , but fluctuating somewhat .",
    "the early departure from elastic behavior prior to the plateau is much less pronounced .",
    "the change in the void shape begins just at the point the mean stress deviates from elastic behavior : @xmath164 goes rapidly from the positive value acquired during elastic expansion to a negative value , _",
    "i.e. _ , from a prolate shape ( elongated in the direction of the strain ) to an oblate shape ( expanded in the transverse directions ) .",
    "@xmath161 , on the other hand , drops from a positive value , almost reaching zero at the prolate - to - oblate transition point ( @xmath165% ) and rising even larger value after that [ in fact , the oblate shape is somewhat more pronounced than the earlier prolate shape , seen as a larger absolute value of @xmath164 in fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ] .",

    "mean plastic strain , equivalent plastic strain , plastic work , and temperature increase together with porosity .",
    "their increase starts immediately at the yield point , _ i.e. _ , when the mean stress first deviates from the elastic behavior .",
    "a bit later than the plastic strain , equivalent plastic strain , plastic work , and temperature , the stress triaxiality increases simultaneously with the first substantial drop in the von mises stress .",
    "the fact that the increase in stress - triaxiality follows later is dependent on how the ratio between mean stress and von mises stress develops , as discussed earlier . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and in the data reported in table  [ tab1 ] the stress - triaxiality started to increase simultaneously with the mean and von mises stresses deviating from the elastic behavior .",
    "the increase of stress - triaxiality is caused by von mises stress plummeting in contrast to nearly constant mean stress .",
    "the drop in von mises stress follows from the flow of dislocations nucleated at the void and from the relaxation of the shear stress of the system due to the flow .",
    "the third region is when the void fraction , mean plastic strain , equivalent plastic strain , plastic work , and temperature switch from rapid increase to a linear growth or even saturate .",
    "subsequently the increase of the stress - triaxiality slows down and plateaus .",
    "the value at the plateau is related in continuum models to the ratio of the mean stress threshold for void growth to the flow stress . at",
    "the plateau von mises stress saturates at a small value , close to the tensile strength , and the shape of the void starts to become more of octahedral shape although having a non - zero quadrupole moment , too .",
    "hence at the second and third regions the mean stress is nearly constant , but von mises stress and the stress - triaxiality changes .",
    "a conclusion might be that once the threshold for void growth is reached , the population of dislocations rises sufficiently to relax the shear stress quite effectively and it drops to a low value ( the flow stress ) ; the mean stress , on the other hand , plateaus since it is relaxed by void growth and requires that the stress at the void surface be sufficiently high to continue to nucleate dislocations .",
    "the fourth region is the failure , when the system breaks , and it is not studied here .    in order to see if the rapid changes studied above are due to the smallness of the size of the void we have done one additional simulation with a system in which the initial void radius is half that in the other simulations ; otherwise , the system size is the same , see fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) . for the small void simulation ,",
    "uniaxial strain at a strain - rate @xmath43/sec has been used .",
    "here the difference is that the quadrupole moment suffers stronger fluctuation due to the smallness of the void , where each of the surface atom contribute more to its value and therefore is even more sensitive to the selection criterion of surface atoms , and also the shape changes are harder to determine based on the @xmath164 behavior .",
    "the other main difference is that the growth of the void is linear all the time .",
    "also the changes in stress - triaxiality in fact advances the porosity when saturating , and the mean stress does not fluctuate but drops more rapidly ( this can be compared with the case without the void , where the mean stress drops abruptly ) .    we have also compared the mean plastic strain and the void volume fraction calculations . in continuum",
    "solid mechanics , it is assumed that solid materials are plastically incompressible .",
    "any local dilation , as indicated by a change in the mean strain , is attributed either to elastic dilation or to a change in the porosity of the material , where the porosity is equated to the void volume fraction .",
    "the porosity @xmath167 and the mean plastic strain @xmath168 are then related according to the equation  @xcite @xmath169 where the dots denote time derivatives .",
    "integration with respect to time , porosity from @xmath170 to @xmath167 , and mean plastic strain from zero to @xmath168 , gives @xmath171 where @xmath170 is the initial porosity .",

    "that calculated directly as the void fraction , the agreement is very good .",
    "the trends are in excellent agreement , but there is a small discrepancy between the curves , so that the porosity from the mean plastic strain is overestimated .",
    "we believe that the discrepancy arises because of the void surface . in calculating the void fraction ,",
    "we have defined the void surface to pass through the center of the surface atoms .",
    "however , the properties of the surface atoms are distinct from the bulk atoms .",
    "therefore , there is some ambiguity in where the surface should be placed , and a small uniform shift @xmath172 of the surface radially into the bulk is enough to account for the discrepancy . in fig .",

    "( [ eq_porosity ] ) , and from the void fraction , eq .",
    "( [ eq_void_frac ] ) , using a constant radius increase @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the lattice constant for the void volume calculation .",
    "the correction for the void size , @xmath175 , is a fit parameter and it varies for different strain - rates and slightly for different loading modes , but is always positive and of the order of the lattice constant , @xmath174",
    ". it should be noted , too , that by taylor expanding eq .",
    "( [ eq_porosity ] ) and discarding the higher order terms , it becomes @xmath176 indicating a linear correspondence between @xmath167 and @xmath168 as long as the void fraction is small .",
    "in this article void growth in copper has been studied in a high range of strain - rates at the atomistic level .",
    "the model has been designed to simulate the growth of a void nucleating from a very weakly bound inclusion during strain - controlled dynamic fracture . in order to see the effect of various modes of expansion and the related stress - triaxiality ,",
    "three different modes have been applied , namely uniaxial , biaxial , and triaxial . the molecular dynamics method developed here",
    "has been shown to be efficient enough to explore the different loading conditions and strain - rates varying over four orders of magnitude .",
    "a uniform expansive loading of a system with periodic boundary conditions has been implemented using a well defined scaling matrix method . for the longest calculations ,",
    "the md method was parallelized successfully .",
    "the macroscopic observables mean stress , von mises stress , stress - triaxiality , mean plastic strain , equivalent plastic strain , plastic work , and temperature have been calculated and compared with the microscopic quantities measured at the atomistic - level , such as the volume of the void and its shape change .",
    "a method to describe the shape changes in the void is introduced and employed , namely calculations of the multipole moments of the void based on spherical harmonics in polynomial , not trigonometric , form . when calculating the volume of the void with an unknown shape or defining solid surface for the multipole moment calculation a useful method , namely optimal triangular tessellation , has been introduced .",
    "this method has been extended from the usual planar case to non - planar objects such as the surface of the void .",
    "when the different measured quantities are compared with each other during an md simulation in uniaxial expansion , it is found that at early stages of plasticity von mises stress , and thus also stress - triaxiality , plays a more significant role to the void growth and its shape change than expected . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the macroscopic plastic quantities as mean and equivalent plastic strain as well as plastic work and temperature , seem to be more dependent on the simultaneous saturation of the mean stress .",
    "these calculations show a counter - intuitive behavior , observed previously in continuum void growth modeling ,  @xcite that a prolate - to - oblate transition occurs .",
    "when the system starts to yield , the expansion of the void switches from its original elastic extension in the direction of the load to transverse plastic expansion .",
    "the yield stress values for the lowest strain - rates @xmath0/sec are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured spall strength .",
    "@xcite the fact that mean plastic strain can be mapped to the growth of the void is consistent with continuum models .",
    "@xcite    this study leaves many open questions .",
    "for instance related to the void growth are the dislocations , which occur when the system yields . since the fcc crystal studied here is perfect apart from the void , the dislocations form from void s surface .",
    "they are also responsible for its growth by carrying material away .",
    "thus the characterization of plasticity surrounding a growing void at the level of dislocations should be investigated , too , especially with respect to the stress - triaxiality .",
    "these investigations are underway .",
    "@xcite their results are beyond the scope of this article , other than to mention that the identification of the yield point in this article does indeed correspond to the point of initial nucleation of dislocations .",
    "another topic that is beyond the scope of this article and needs further investigation , but is closely related to the studies here , is the quantitative connection between the shear stress , and thus the mode of the loading , and the onset of the void growth and the resulting change in the stress state .",
    "other areas where this study can be extended are different materials including different lattice structures such as body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattices ; in the uniaxial case other orientations of the lattice as @xmath177 and @xmath178 ; continuously changing stress - triaxiality in order to create the full yield surface to the stress space similarly as in gurson type of continuum studies ;  @xcite to include grain boundaries , defects , pre - existing dislocations , several voids , etc .",
    "this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s .",
    "of energy by the university of california , lawrence livermore national laboratory , under contract number w-7405-eng-48 .",
    "the authors would like to thank dr .",
    "richard becker bringing to our attention refs .   and   that find the prolate - oblate transition in continuum modeling .",
    "the 24 different polynomial terms of the multipole moments used in this study are listed below .",
    "@xcite here the conventional notation is used , so that the principal axis of the coordinates is the @xmath133-direction . when these formulas are used in interpreting the void shape evolution , the principal axis is the direction with uniaxial loading , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath131-coordinate in the article",
