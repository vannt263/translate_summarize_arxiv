    "pure @xmath2 lattice gauge theories within the fundamental representation of the gauge group show a finite temperature deconfinement phase transition together with the breaking of a global @xmath3 center symmetry .",
    "but if confinement is a feature of the yang - mills continuum degrees of freedom it should be independent of the group representation for the lattice action . as polyakov s center symmetry breaking mechanism is available only to half - integer representations of the group , a finite temperature investigation of wilson s action for @xmath0 in the adjoint representation , i.e. @xmath4 , might offer interesting insight to the present understanding of confinement .",

    "schwimmer @xcite found a similar phase diagram using a villain discretization for the center blind part of action ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath8\\ ] ] @xmath9 being an auxiliary @xmath1 plaquette variable . by defining @xmath1 magnetic monopole and electric vortex densities",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 they argued that the bulk phase transitions were caused by condensation of these lattice artifacts .",
    "they also suggested @xcite a possible suppression mechanism via the introduction of chemical potentials of the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "recently gavai and datta @xcite explicitely realized this suggestion , studying the @xmath16 phase diagram as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "they found lines of second order finite temperature phase transitions crossing the @xmath19 and @xmath20 axes for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the limiting case @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath4 theory with a @xmath1 monopole chemical potential , a quantitative study is difficult because of the lack of an order parameter .",
    "the @xmath1 global symmetry remains trivially unbroken .",
    "a thermodynamical approach @xcite shows a steep rise in the energy density for asymmetric lattices with @xmath25 and a peak in the specific heat at least for @xmath26 , supporting the idea of a second order deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the authors have seen the adjoint polyakov loop to fluctuate around zero below the phase transition and to take the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 above the phase transition as @xmath29 .",
    "we study an adjoint representation wilson action modified by a chemical potential suppressing the @xmath1 magnetic monopoles @xmath30    the link variables are taken in the fundamental representation only to improve the speed of our simulations , after checking that with links represented by @xmath4 matrices nothing changes .",

    "are separated by a bulk first order line at which @xmath1 monopoles condense , phase i being continously connected with the physical @xmath0 phase as @xmath20 is turned on .",
    "finite temperature lines , at which @xmath35 shows a jump , cross the plane more or less horizontally . putting aside the order parameter problem , the scaling behaviour at the critical temperature @xmath36 as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath17 turns out difficult in phase i , whereas in phase ii it shows a nice scaling behaviour in @xmath37 at fixed @xmath38 .",
    "a quantitative study of the observed finite temperature transition is viable either relying on pure thermodynamical quantities @xcite or defining a reasonable order parameter , i.e. by understanding the underlying symmetry breaking mechanism , if any .",
    "the only hints we have are the change in the distribution of the adjoint polyakov line operator @xmath39 and the values it takes in the continuum limit . after maximal abelian gauge ( mag )",
    "@xcite and abelian projection it is indeed possible to establish an exact global symmetry which can be broken at the phase transition and a related order parameter .",
    "taking @xmath40 as the projected link in the adjoint theory , with @xmath41 the adjoint representation generators of the lie algebra , it is easy to see that the `` parity '' operator @xmath42 acting on all links living at fixed time as @xmath43 leaves all the plaquettes ( and thus the action ) invariant , while changing the polyakov line . if @xmath44 is the polyakov line global abelian phase , then for the spatial average @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if this symmetry is broken at the phase transition , then @xmath47 below and @xmath48 above , with @xmath49 .",

    "2 shows the volume distribution of the polyakov line angle at the phase transition for some typical configurations .",
    "although such a sharp change can be observed also for the full @xmath53 distribution , in the latter case a quantitative analysis is made difficult by the asymmetry of the values at which it peaks . in the abelian projected case , after mag , @xmath54 is clearly flat below the phase transition , peaking around @xmath55 and @xmath56 above . in fig .",
