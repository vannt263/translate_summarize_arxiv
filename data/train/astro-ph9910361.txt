    "ngc  1672 is a @xmath6 barred spiral galaxy in the southern hemisphere that is viewed nearly face on .",
    "it shows dramatic nuclear and extranuclear star - formation activity including starburst regions near the ends of its strong bar ( e.g. , pastoriza 1967 ; osmer , smith & weedman 1974 ; baumgart & peterson 1986 ) .",
    "it may have a seyfert  2 nucleus ( e.g. , vron , vron & zuiderwijk 1981 ; brandt , halpern & iwasawa 1996 , hereafter bhi96 ) , but at present this has not been firmly established .",
    "ngc  1672 is at a distance of 16.3  mpc ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 ) , and the galactic neutral hydrogen column density in its direction is @xmath8  @xmath5 ( heiles & cleary 1979 ) .",
    "x - ray emission is powerful for probing both the endpoints of stellar evolution and seyfert activity , and ngc  1672 is known to be a prodigious source of x - rays .",
    "bhi96 presented a detailed   position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) study of ngc  1672 , and they found several sources of x - ray emission coincident with the galaxy .",
    "the nucleus showed the strongest emission .",
    "this emission was slightly resolved , suggesting at least some starburst x - ray activity , but the  data were unable to determine whether the bulk of the emission was from a starburst region or hidden seyfert .",
    "awaki & koyama ( 1993 ) claimed a hard x - ray detection of a @xmath9  erg  s@xmath2 seyfert nucleus with the  large area counter ( lac ) , but concerns about source confusion were present ( the lac was a non - imaging detector and had a @xmath10 field of view ) .",
    "in addition to the nuclear x - ray emission , bhi96 also found luminous x - ray sources coincident with the starburst regions near the ends of the galactic bar .",
    "it was difficult to determine the nature of these sources due to limited photon statistics .",
    "they could be consistently modeled as superbubbles , collections of x - ray binaries , or ` super - eddington sources ' ( e.g. , fabbiano 1998 ) .    to investigate the x - ray properties of ngc  1672 further",
    ", we performed a second  hri observation of it in 1997 .",
    "our goals for this observation were ( 1 ) to study the long - term x - ray variability properties of the currently known sources , ( 2 ) to search for new x - ray sources that were not detected before due to their variability , and ( 3 ) to obtain better photon statistics for investigation of any weak point sources or large - scale diffuse x - ray emission . here",
    "we present the results from our second hri observation as well as an improved analysis of the original 1992 hri observation .",
    "we also use  data from 1995 to constrain the hard x - ray properties of ngc  1672 .",
    "ngc  1672 was observed with the  hri ( e.g. , david et  al .",
    "1999 ) during the period 27  january  1997 to 2  march  1997 ( 35.0  ks exposure time ) .",
    "the observation went smoothly , and reduction and analysis of the data were performed with the asterix software system ( allan & vallance 1995 ) .",
    "we created three images for subsequent analysis : ( 1 ) an image from the 1997 hri observation , ( 2 ) an image from the original 1992 hri observation ( 24.5  ks ; see bhi96 ) , and ( 3 ) a ` combined ' image using the data from both the 1992 and 1997 observations ( 59.5  ks of total exposure time ) .",
    "all images were made with @xmath11 per pixel resolution so that the hri point spread function ( psf ) was oversampled by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "we also used only hri channels 38 , since this channel range provides maximum sensitivity for detecting point sources and low - surface - brightness diffuse emission ( see  3.4 of david et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the three images described in  2.1 were analyzed using the point source searching software pss ( allan 1995 ) .",
    "locates point sources by convolving an hri image with a position - dependent model for the hri psf , and it calculates point source significances using the cash ( 1979 ) statistic .",
    "we used constant backgrounds for each of the three images , and our manual background analyses showed that this is valid in the region around ngc  1672 .",
    "we consider for further study point sources that are within @xmath13 of the center of ngc  1672 ( this corresponds to the main optical extent of the galaxy ) and are found to be significant at @xmath14 in at least one of the three images . given these criteria ,",
    "we expect @xmath15 false sources in total .",
    "also creates a ` significance map ' showing the hri image after it has been convolved with the psf model ; we show the significance map for the 1997 observation in figure  1 .    in table",
    "1 we give ( background - subtracted ) source counts , mean count rates , fluxes , and luminosities for all sources .",
    "we have adopted the source naming convention of bhi96 but have also added sources x-7 , x-8 and x-9 .",
    "source counts were calculated using circular regions chosen to fit the morphology of each source . when sources were not detected in one of the images , we calculated @xmath16 upper limits .",
    "we used the  ( mukai 1997 ) software package to convert the mean count rates for each source into 0.22.0  kev fluxes and luminosities . for x-1",
    ", we adopted the raymond - smith thermal plasma model of bhi96 to perform this conversion .",
    "for all other sources , we adopted a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath17 and the galactic column density .",
    "the 1997 observation has revealed a new probable x - ray source ( x-8 ) within the optical extent of ngc  1672 .",
    "this source lies near the edge of one of the prominent spiral arms .",
    "it is detected at the @xmath18 level , so there is a small but non - negligible chance that it is due to a statistical fluctuation .",
    "in addition , our analyses of all three images show that the extended source x-3 of bhi96 actually appears to be two separate sources ( labeled here as x-3 and x-7 ; see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "this difference between bhi96 and our analysis is understandable because our hri data have been through a revised processing that includes better filtering as well as satellite aspect information from the  wide field camera ( m. corcoran 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "these factors improve the spatial resolution .",
    "in addition , bhi96 used the full hri band while we only use channels 38 ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "finally , searching the 59.5  ks combined image reveals another new point source , x-9 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "this x - ray source is spatially coincident with a bright region along one of the spiral arms that contains three large h  ii regions ( numbers 31 , 34 and 39 in table  2 of evans et  al .",
    "the alignment of the x - ray and optical emission supports the reality of the x - ray detection .    to check the x - ray spatial extent results of bhi96",
    ", we have performed spatial extent analyses for x-1 and x-2 using both the 1992 and 1997 observations .",
    "our results are in general agreement with those of bhi96 : x-2 does not show any clear evidence for spatial extent while x-1 is extended on about the scale of the nuclear ring .",
    "x-1 is more extended than x-2 , and this strongly suggests that its apparent extent is not an artefact of aspect solution errors ( see morse 1994 ) .",
    "we have compared the mean count rates between the 1992 and 1997 observations to search for long - term source variability.% during this time period ( see  2.3.3 of david et  al .",
    "] x-3 shows significant mean count rate variability with an @xmath0% increase between 1992 and 1997 . the poisson probability that this variability is merely due to a statistical fluctuation is @xmath19%",
    "we have searched for rapid variability of x-3 within the 1997 data , and we do not find any highly significant variability .",
    "the source x-5 , which is thought to be associated with a foreground star ( see bhi96 ) , also shows significant variability . , and it is thus at a distance of @xmath20  pc . the observed x - ray - to - optical flux ratio is consistent with that expected for a g5 star ( see figure  1 of maccacaro et  al .",
    "1988 ) , and the observed x - ray variability is not implausibly large for such a star . ] x-1 and x-2 do not show significant variability .",
    "we place upper limits of @xmath21% and @xmath22% on the variability of x-1 and x-2 , respectively .",
    "we have used the adaptive kernel smoothing algorithm asmooth ( ebeling , white & rangarajan 1999 ) to search for diffuse x - ray emission in the 59.5  ks combined image .",
    "asmooth convolves a gaussian of variable , position - dependent size with an image to allow detection of spatial structure on a wide range of scales , and it provides a quantitative assessment of the significances of observed features .",
    "we find evidence for an @xmath23 area of diffuse x - ray emission between x-1 and x-2 ( see figure  3 ) . we have examined if this emission can be explained as ` spill over ' from x-1 and x-2 , and the observed emission appears to significantly exceed that expected from these two sources ( even after taking into account reasonable  aspect solution errors ; see morse 1994 ) .",
    "note that similar emission is not seen between x-1 and x-3 even though these two sources are closer together than x-1 and x-2 ( @xmath24 versus @xmath25 separation ) .",
    "asmooth indicates that the diffuse emission is significant at the @xmath26 level , and our manual calculations using rectangular regions give similar significances .",
    "we estimate @xmath27 counts in total from the diffuse emission , so the count rate is @xmath28  count  s@xmath2 .",
    "this emission may be associated with hot , diffuse gas in the interstellar medium of ngc  1672 .",
    "if we adopt a 0.55  kev raymond - smith model with solar abundances and the galactic column density , we estimate a total 0.22.0  kev flux of @xmath29  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath2 and a 0.22.0  kev luminosity of @xmath30  erg  s@xmath2 ( the flux and luminosity values depend fairly strongly upon the unknown abundances of the gas ) .",
    "of course , we are not able to prove that this emission must be from truly diffuse hot gas . it could also plausibly arise from several weak point sources that are individually below our detection threshold .",
    "ngc  1672 was observed with  ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) on 2324 november  1995 .",
    "both solid - state imaging spectrometer ccd detectors ( sis0 and sis1 ) and both gas imaging spectrometer scintillation proportional counters ( gis2 and gis3 ) were operated .",
    "the sis were operated in 1  ccd mode , and the gis were operated in ph mode .",
    "we have used the revision  2 processed data from goddard space flight center for the analysis below , and we have adopted the standard revision  2 screening criteria ( see pier 1997 ) .",
    "after data screening , the exposure times were 33  ks for sis0/sis1 and 40  ks for gis2/gis3 .",
    "data reduction was performed using xselect ( ingham & arnaud 1998 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of  is a significant limiting factor when studying ngc  1672 , so we will present only the main results of our  imaging analysis .",
    "the psfs of the  x - ray telescopes have half - power diameters of @xmath31 ( compare with figures  13 and note that x-1 and x-3 are only separated by @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , they also have fairly sharp cores that allow two point sources as close as @xmath32 to be resolved .",
    "in the case of the gis , the final spatial resolution is worsened somewhat further by the detectors spatial responses , and the gis can not effectively study structure on scales smaller than @xmath33 . for sources observed in an approximately on - axis manner , the   sis and gis positional uncertainties are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ( 90% confidence ; gotthelf 1996 and e. gotthelf 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "we have created full ( 0.610  kev for sis and 1.010  kev for gis ) , soft ( 0.62.0  kev for sis and 1.03.0  kev for gis ) , hard ( 210  kev for sis and gis ) , and ultra - hard ( 510  kev for sis and gis ) images for each of the four  detectors .",
    "we also created summed sis0+sis1 and gis2+gis3 images in all bands .",
    "these images will be used in the spatial analysis below .",
    "sis images were made with @xmath36 per pixel resolution , and gis images were made with @xmath37 per pixel resolution .",
    "we have used ximage ( giommi , angelini & white 1997 ) and idl to inspect the images created in  3.1 . at low energies our results are consistent with those expected based upon the  data .",
    "x-1 is observed to be the dominant x - ray source in ngc  1672 ( see figure  4a ) , and we also detect x-3 and probably x-2 in the sis images . we have compared the  and  data to examine source variability .",
    "we do not find any strong evidence for variability , although source confusion ( see  3.1 ) significantly limits our variability analyses .    in the harder 210  kev and 510  kev images",
    ", however , ngc  1672 has a considerably different appearance ( see figure  4b ) .",
    "the dominant 210  kev emission is observed to be coincident with the hri sources x-3 and x-7 ( in both the sis0+sis1 and gis2+gis3 images ) , and we detect only weak 210  kev emission from x-1 .",
    "note that x-3 was also found to be the hardest source in the  pspc band by bhi96 . in the 510  kev gis2+gis3 image ,",
    "the only detectable emission from ngc  1672 is coincident with x-3 and x-7 .",
    "ngc  1672 is not detected in the 510  kev band by the sis detectors , probably due to their smaller effective areas in this energy range ( see tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) .      due to the limited spatial resolution of  ( see  3.1 ) , we have only been able to perform reliable spectral analyses for ngc  1672 as a whole ( see  7.4 of _ the asca data reduction guide _ ) . at energies above @xmath38  35  kev",
    ", x-3 is the dominant source , but at lower energies our spectra contain contributions from x-1 , x-2 and x-3 .",
    "we have extracted spectra from each detector using all of the acceptable exposure time , and we have only used data where ngc  1672 is reliably detected ( 0.65  kev for the sis and 18  kev for the gis ) .",
    "we have grouped our spectra so that there are 15 photons per spectral data point , to allow the use of @xmath39 fitting techniques .",
    "we have first performed preliminary spectral fitting for each of the  detectors separately , and although the errors were large we obtained consistent results .",
    "we have therefore jointly fitted the spectra from all four detectors , and we detail these results below . aside from the absolute model normalizations , we tied together the fit parameters across the four  detectors .",
    "we use   ( arnaud 1996 ) for all spectral fitting below .",
    "we start by fitting the data in the 28  kev band , where x-3 is the dominant source .",
    "we use a basic power - law model with the galactic absorption column .",
    "this model provides an acceptable fit with @xmath40 for 56 degrees of freedom .",
    "we obtain a power - law photon index of @xmath41 ( fit parameter errors are for @xmath42 ) , and there is no evidence for systematic positive residuals near the 6.46.97  kev iron  k@xmath43 lines .",
    "the 28  kev flux is @xmath44  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath2 , corresponding to a 28  kev luminosity for ngc  1672 of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "we have then applied this same model to the full 0.68  kev band .",
    "we obtain a steeper power law with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for 153 degrees of freedom .",
    "the fit is statistically acceptable , although we observe systematic positive residuals from 0.61.0  kev and systematic negative residuals from 1.11.6  kev .",
    "these are understandable in the context of the  spectral fitting presented in  2.3 of bhi96 ; the emission from ngc  1672 below @xmath12  kev appears to be largely from hot , diffuse gas that is associated with x-1 , x-2 and x-3 ( i.e. , it is _ not _ primarily the diffuse emission discussed in  2.3 ) .",
    "if we take the best fitting 28  kev model and extrapolate it downward in energy , we see clear positive residuals that are likely to be associated with the thermal gas emission ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "we note that such emission is commonly seen from galaxies with starburst activity ( e.g. , ptak et  al .",
    "1999 ) . we have added a raymond - smith component to our basic power - law model , and this provides a highly significant improvement in overall fit quality .",
    "we obtain a plasma temperature of @xmath48  kev , a photon index of @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for 151 degrees of freedom ( @xmath51 compared to the basic power - law model ; fit parameter errors are for @xmath52 ) . the plasma temperature from our fit",
    "is consistent with that of bhi96 , and the underlying photon index agrees better with that seen in the 28  kev band .",
    "the derived plasma temperature is also in good agreement with the temperatures obtained for other starburst galaxies ( e.g. , figure  3 of ptak et  al .",
    "the plasma abundances are poorly constrained , and we have adopted solar abundances in the fit above . the derived plasma temperature , power - law photon index , and x - ray luminosity do not depend sensitively upon the abundance assumptions for abundance enhancements up to a factor of @xmath53 , and we note that storchi - bergmann et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue for moderately supersolar abundances in the nucleus of ngc  1672 . in reality",
    ", we believe that the thermal emission below @xmath12  kev is likely to arise from gas with a range of temperatures and abundances , and our single raymond - smith component model should not be taken too literally ( see ptak et  al .",
    "1999 for further discussion on this matter ) .",
    "comparison of the soft and hard x - ray luminosities of x-3 suggests that this source may suffer from significant intrinsic absorption ( see  4 for further discussion ) , and we have examined if our data constrain an absorption column affecting only the power - law spectral component . unfortunately , our data do not tightly constrain such absorption , and column densities ranging from 0  @xmath5 to @xmath54  @xmath5 are allowed by our data . due to significant -  cross - calibration uncertainties ( e.g. , iwasawa ,",
    "fabian & nandra 1999 ) as well as the time variability of x-3 , we have not performed detailed joint spectral fitting of the data from these two missions .",
    "the 28  kev flux we measure from ngc  1672 is @xmath55 times smaller than the 210  kev flux of @xmath56  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath2 given by awaki & koyama ( 1993 ) , and our image analyses in  3.2 show that most of the 210  kev flux originates outside the nucleus .",
    "thus , the  data do not provide evidence for a highly absorbed nuclear x - ray source as might be expected for a seyfert  2 .",
    "however , the  data do not rule out a seyfert  2 nucleus where the torus has a large enough column density to absorb almost all x - rays below 8  kev .",
    "given the emission at other wavelengths ( see  3.1 of bhi96 ) , a nuclear x - ray source with a luminosity up to @xmath57  erg  s@xmath2 appears plausible . we can estimate the required torus column density for a plausible scenario using our spectral fits above .",
    "we have added an extra @xmath17 power law to our best 0.68  kev fit and assumed an unabsorbed 28  kev flux of @xmath56  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath2 for this power law ( corresponding to a 28  kev luminosity of @xmath58  erg  s@xmath2 ) . to represent absorption by the torus",
    ", we added an extra absorption component acting only on this power law . to allow for consistency between data and model",
    ", the fit requires the extra absorption component to have a column density of @xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "about half of the seyfert  2 population has torus column densities as large as this ( e.g. , risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) .",
    "many seyfert  2s with large torus column densities show strong iron  k@xmath43 emission lines . while we do not see evidence for iron  k@xmath43 lines in our data , our constraints are not tight . for a narrow iron  k@xmath43",
    "line at 6.4  kev , our 90% confidence upper limit on the equivalent width is 750  ev .",
    "we have presented new  hri and  data that constrain starburst and seyfert activity in ngc  1672 .",
    "notably , we do not find any evidence for hard x - ray emission associated with the nuclear source x-1 despite the claims for seyfert activity made based upon optical emission - line , infrared emission - line , x - ray , and radio data ( see bhi96 for a review ) .",
    "we also find no evidence for long - term soft x - ray variability of x-1 . if ngc  1672 indeed has a luminous seyfert  2 nucleus , it must have been heavily obscured during the  observation by a ` compton - thick ' torus .",
    "our x - ray spectral results stand in contrast to those of awaki & koyama ( 1993 ) , who claimed to detect luminous power - law emission from an obscured seyfert nucleus with @xmath59  @xmath5 .",
    "while it is perhaps possible that the torus column density along our line of sight has increased by a factor of @xmath60 between the  and  observations , the simplest explanation for the discrepant results is that the  data suffered from source confusion .",
    "the other arguments for seyfert activity in ngc  1672 , while entirely plausible , lack robustness .",
    "the reasoning based upon the composite nature of the nuclear optical emission lines ( vron et  al .",
    "1981 ) relies upon fairly subtle effects , and we note that storchi - bergmann et  al . (",
    "1996 ) have recently found that the nuclear emission - line ratios can be explained via ionization by hot ( @xmath61  k ) stars . in this case",
    "ngc  1672 may be an example of a non - agn liner .",
    "furthermore , moorwood & oliva ( 1988 ) failed to detect the broad brackett @xmath62 line claimed by kawara , nishida & gregory ( 1987 ) , and we are not aware of any confirmation of the radio variability suggested by tovmassian  ( 1968 ) . while we must still admit the possibility of a luminous",
    ", highly obscured seyfert nucleus in ngc  1672 , the physical interpretation of its optical emission lines is not yet clear , and the balance of evidence appears to be shifting away from this .",
    "the most interesting extranuclear source in ngc  1672 is x-3 .",
    "we have demonstrated that x-3 shows large - amplitude soft x - ray variability on a timescale of @xmath53  years , suggesting that it is a single ( or at most a few ) object .",
    "x-3 has a peak observed soft x - ray luminosity of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 , and it probably has an even larger hard x - ray luminosity . if the hard x - ray emission of  3.2 and figure  4b originates from x-3 ( the most probable possibility in our opinion ) , its 0.28  kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath3  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "the fairly large ratio of hard to soft x - ray flux could be explained if x-3 suffers from some absorption within ngc  1672 ; the hard spectral components of starburst galaxies are often absorbed by column densities of @xmath63  @xmath5 ( e.g. , ptak et  al .",
    "the variability , luminosity , and extranuclear location of x-3 suggest that it is a powerful x - ray binary , young supernova remnant , or young hypernova remnant .",
    "no supernovae are listed for ngc  1672 in the asiago supernova catalogue ( barbon et  al .",
    "if x-3 is an accreting compact object that emits isotropically , the mass required by the the eddington limit is @xmath64  m@xmath65 . to our knowledge",
    ", the only source in our galaxy with a comparable x - ray luminosity is grs  1915 + 105 ( e.g. , greiner , morgan & remillard 1998 ) , and x-3 ranks among the more luminous of the ` super - eddington sources ' seen in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano 1998 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the new x - ray sources we find in ngc  1672 ( x-7 , x-8 and x-9 ) are also quite luminous and exceed the eddington limit for a 1.4  m@xmath65 object .",
    "they too are probably x - ray binaries or supernova remnants , and sources with comparable luminosities are seen fairly frequently in nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. , read , ponman & strickland 1997 , hereafter rps97 ) .",
    "we have compared the number and the luminosity distribution of our extranuclear x - ray sources with those of the nearby galaxies studied by rps97 , and ngc  1672 shows a moderately large although not extreme amount of extranuclear x - ray source activity .",
    "there are almost certainly many more x - ray binaries and supernova remnants lying below our current x - ray sensitivity threshold ( @xmath66  erg  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "a moderate - length  observation holds particular promise for improving our understanding of ngc  1672 .",
    "separation of the diffuse nuclear x - ray emission from any point - like central source would provide a sensitive probe for low - level seyfert activity .",
    "in addition ,  would allow an excellent imaging study of the nuclear starburst x - rays , and like the radio emission the x - rays might trace the nuclear ring ( e.g. , lindblad & jrster , in preparation ) .",
    "furthermore ,   would provide much better spectral constraints upon x-3 and would detect x - ray binaries and supernova remnants down to @xmath67  erg  s@xmath2 in this nearby starburst galaxy .",
