    "more generally , we show that for any integer @xmath7 , analytic positive contractions @xmath0 satisfy a maximal inequality @xmath16 note that for any @xmath5 , the sequence of operators @xmath17 appearing here is the @xmath18-th order discrete derivative of the original sequence @xmath19 .",
    "the proofs of these inequalities rely on the boundedness of certain discrete littlewood - paley square functions of independent interest that we establish in section 3 .",
    "in particular we will show that for @xmath2 as above , we have an estimate @xmath20 these maximal theorems and square function estimates extend stein s famous results @xcite which show that ( [ 1max0 ] ) , ( [ 1maxm ] ) and ( [ 1lp1 ] ) hold true in the case when @xmath2 acts as a contraction @xmath21 for any @xmath22 and its @xmath23-realization is a positive selfadjoint operator .    let @xmath24 be a von neumann algebra equipped with a normal semifinite faithful trace and for any @xmath25 , let @xmath26 be the associated noncommutative @xmath8-space .",
    "let @xmath27 be a positive contraction whose restriction to @xmath28 extends to a contraction @xmath29 . recall that in this case , @xmath2 actually extends to a contraction @xmath30 for any @xmath22 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath2 satisfies a noncommutative analog of ( [ 1ergodic ] ) . in the latter paper , a large part of stein s work mentioned above",
    "is also transfered to the noncommutative setting .",
    "indeed it is shown that if the @xmath23-realization @xmath31 is a positive selfadjoint operator , then for any @xmath1 , @xmath2 satisfies noncommutative analogs of ( [ 1max0 ] ) and ( [ 1maxm ] ) .",
    "this is generalized in @xcite under an appropriate condition on the numerical range of @xmath31 .",
    "we extend these results by showing that for any @xmath1 , the noncommutative analogs of ( [ 1max0 ] ) and ( [ 1maxm ] ) hold true provided that @xmath32 is merely analytic ( which is a much weaker assumption ) .    besides investigating the behaviour of operators and their powers ( discrete semigroups ) , we consider continuous semigroups @xmath33 , both in the commutative and in the noncommutative settings .",
    "the continuous analog of the maximal inequality ( [ 1max0 ] ) reads as follows : @xmath34 we prove that such an estimate holds true whenever @xmath33 is a bounded analytic semigroup on @xmath35 ( with @xmath1 ) such that @xmath36 is a positive contraction for any @xmath37 .",
    "likewise we show that the noncommutative analog of ( [ 1sg ] ) holds true whenever @xmath33 is a semigroup of positive contractions on @xmath38 for any @xmath39 and @xmath33 is a bounded analytic semigroup on @xmath26 ( with @xmath1 ) .",
    "these results both extend stein s classical maximal theorem @xcite for semigroups and its recent noncommutative counterpart from @xcite .",
    "finally we extend some results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) concerning @xmath9-boundedness in the noncommutative setting .    in the above presentation and",
    "later on in the paper , @xmath40 stands for an inequality up to a constant which may depend on @xmath2 and @xmath18 , but not on @xmath41 .",
    "an operator @xmath0 is called regular if there is a constant @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for any finite sequence @xmath44 in @xmath35 .",
    "then we let @xmath45 denote the smallest @xmath46 for which this holds .",
    "the set of all regular operators on @xmath35 is a vector space on which @xmath47 is a norm .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is contractively regular if @xmath48 .",
    "clearly any positive operator @xmath2 is regular and @xmath49 in this case .",
    "thus all statements given for contractively regular operators apply to positive contractions .",
    "it is well - known that conversely , @xmath2 is regular with @xmath50 if and only if there is a positive operator @xmath51 with @xmath52 , such that @xmath53 for any @xmath54 ( see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 is contractively regular if @xmath2 acts as a contraction @xmath55 for any @xmath56 .",
    "we recall some definitions and simple facts about sectorial operators and analyticity . throughout",
    "we let @xmath57 denote an arbitrary ( complex ) banach space and we let @xmath58 denote the algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath57 .",
    "next for any angle @xmath59 , we introduce @xmath60 the open sector of angle @xmath61 around @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be a ( possibly unbounded ) closed linear operator , with dense domain @xmath64 .",
    "we let @xmath65 denote the spectrum of @xmath66 and for any @xmath67 , we let @xmath68 denote the corresponding resolvent operator .",
    "we say that @xmath66 is sectorial if there exists an angle @xmath69 such that @xmath65 is contained in the closed sector @xmath70 and @xmath71 then we let @xmath72 be the infimum of all @xmath73 such that @xmath74 holds , and this real number is called the type of @xmath66 .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath74 holds true for some @xmath69 , then there exists @xmath75 such that @xmath76 holds true as well .",
    "thus , @xmath77    let @xmath33 be a bounded strongly continuous semigroup on @xmath57 .",
    "we call it a bounded analytic semigroup if there exists a positive angle @xmath78 and a bounded analytic family @xmath79 extending @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the infinitesimal generator of @xmath33 .",
    "analyticity has two classical characterizations in terms of that operator .",
    "first , @xmath33 is a bounded analytic semigroup if and only if @xmath82 for any @xmath83 and there exists a constant @xmath13 such that @xmath84 for any @xmath83 .",
    "note here that since @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 second , @xmath33 is a bounded analytic semigroup if and only if @xmath66 is sectorial and @xmath87 . according to ( [ 2sector1 ] ) , this is also equivalent to saying that @xmath66 satisfies @xmath88 .",
    "we refer e.g. to @xcite for proofs and complements on semigroups .",
    "we will make a crucial use of @xmath89-calculus and square functions for sectorial operators",
    ". here are the basic notions and results which will be needed . for more information",
    ", we refer e.g. to @xcite .    for any @xmath90",
    ", we define @xmath91 this is a banach algebra with the norm @xmath92 then let @xmath93 be the subalgebra of all @xmath94 for which there exist two constants @xmath95 such that @xmath96 for any sectorial operator @xmath66 , for any @xmath97 and for any @xmath98 , we define @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the boundary @xmath102 oriented counterclockwise .",
    "this integral is well - defined , its definition does not depend on @xmath103 and the resulting mapping @xmath104 is an algebra homomorphism from @xmath105 into @xmath58 .",
    "we say that @xmath66 has a bounded @xmath106 functional calculus if the latter homomorphism is bounded , that is , there exists a constant @xmath107 such that @xmath108    consider now the specific case when @xmath109 , with @xmath1 .",
    "on such a space , cowling , doust , mcintosh and yagi have proved a remarkable equivalence result between the boundedness of @xmath110 functional calculus and certain square function estimates . in particular",
    "they established the following key result .",
    "[ 2sfe ] @xcite let @xmath66 be a sectorial operator on @xmath35 and assume that there exists @xmath111 such that @xmath66 admits a bounded @xmath106 functional calculus for any @xmath112 .",
    "then for any @xmath112 and any @xmath113 , there exists a constant @xmath42 such that @xmath114    let us now turn to discrete semigroups .",
    "let @xmath115 .",
    "we say that @xmath2 is power bounded if the set @xmath116 is bounded .",
    "then we say that @xmath2 is analytic if moreover the set @xmath117 is bounded .",
    "this notion of discrete analyticity goes back to @xcite .",
    "since @xmath118 is the ` discrete derivative ' of the sequence @xmath119 , we can regard @xmath120 as a discrete analog of @xmath121 . in view of ( [ 2derivative ] ) , the boundedness of ( [ 2analytic ] ) is therefore a natutal discrete analog of the boundedness of @xmath122 .",
    "the most important result concerning discrete analyticity is perhaps the following characterization : an operator @xmath123 is power bounded and analytic if and only if @xmath124 this property is called the ` ritt condition ' .",
    "the key argument for this characterization is due to o. nevanlinna @xcite , however we refer to @xcite for a complete proof and complements . let us gather a few observations which will be used later on in the paper .",
    "first we note that ( [ 2ritt ] ) implies that @xmath125 indeed , @xmath126 for any @xmath127 .",
    "second , ( [ 2ritt ] ) implies the existence of a constant @xmath13 such that @xmath128 whenever @xmath129 this means that @xmath130 satisfies @xmath88 .",
    "according to ( [ 2sector1 ] ) , this implies that @xmath66 is a sectorial operator of type @xmath131 .",
    "hence @xmath132 in this case , the bounded analytic semigroup @xmath33 generated by @xmath81 is given by @xmath133    we now recall the definition of @xmath9-boundedness ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath134 be a sequence of independent rademacher variables on some probability space @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath136 be the closure of @xmath137 in the bochner space @xmath138 .",
    "thus for any finite family @xmath139 in @xmath57 , we have @xmath140 by definition , a set @xmath141 is @xmath9-bounded if there is a constant @xmath42 such that for any finite families @xmath142 in @xmath143 , and any @xmath139 in @xmath57 , we have @xmath144 obviously any @xmath9-bounded set is bounded and if @xmath57 is isomorphic to a hilbert space , then all bounded subsets of @xmath58 are automatically @xmath9-bounded .",

    "we shall now consider these general definitions for specific sets of operators .",
    "let @xmath33 be a bounded analytic semigroup on @xmath57 .",

    "the above notions of @xmath9-analyticity were introduced by weis @xcite for the continuous case and blunck @xcite for the discrete one . in both cases they played a crucial role in the solution of maximal regularity problems on umd banach spaces , see the above papers for more information .",
