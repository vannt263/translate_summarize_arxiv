    "tropical algebraic geometry is a piecewise linear shadow of algebraic geometry , in which varieties are replaced by polyhedral complexes .",
    "this area has grown significantly in the past decade and has had great success in numerous applications , such as mikhalkin s calculation of gromov - witten invariants of @xmath0 @xcite , the work of cools - draisma - payne - robeva @xcite and jensen - payne @xcite on brill - noether theory , and the gross - siebert program in mirror symmetry @xcite .    one current limitation of the theory , however , is that most techniques developed to date are focused on tropical varieties and tropical cycles , as opposed to schemes or more general spaces .",
    "many of the standard tools of modern algebraic geometry thus do not yet have a tropical counterpart",
    ".    in @xcite , jeffrey and noah giansiracusa described how to tropicalize a subscheme of a toric variety using congruences on the semiring of tropical polynomials .",
    "the authors of this paper developed this further in @xcite , clarifying the connection to tropical linear spaces and valuated matroids .",
    "building on this work , in this paper we investigate a special class of ideals in the semiring of tropical polynomials , called tropical ideals , in which bounded - degree pieces are `` matroidal '' .",
    "this allows us to define tropical subschemes of a tropical toric variety , which include , but are not limited to , tropicalizations of classical subschemes of toric varieties .",
    "we show that , unlike for more general ideals , varieties of tropical ideals are always finite polyhedral complexes .",
    "in addition , even though the semiring of tropical polynomials is far from noetherian , the restricted class of tropical ideals satisfies the ascending chain condition .",
    "they also satisfy a version of the nullstellensatz that is completely analogous to the classical formulation .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the tropical semiring @xmath2 with the operations tropical sum @xmath3 and tropical multiplication @xmath4 .",
    "the semiring of tropical polynomials @xmath5 $ ] consists of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath1 where all operations are tropical . for simplicity , in this introduction",
    "we describe our results in the case where the ambient toric variety is tropical affine space .",
    "a general treatment for any tropical toric variety is given in section [ s:4 ] .",
    "[ d : tropicalideal ] an ideal @xmath6 $ ] is a _ tropical ideal _ if for each degree @xmath7 the set @xmath8 of polynomials in @xmath9 of degree at most @xmath10 is a tropical linear space , or equivalently , @xmath8 is the set of vectors of a valuated matroid .",
    "more concretely , @xmath9 is a tropical ideal if it satisfies the following `` monomial elimination axiom '' :    here we use the notation @xmath11_{\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathbf{u}}}$ ] to denote the coefficient of the monomial @xmath12 in the tropical polynomial @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 is an ideal in @xmath15 $ ] then its tropicalization @xmath16 is a tropical ideal in @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "however , the class of tropical ideals is larger ; we exhibit in example  [ ex : non - realizable ] a tropical ideal that can not be realized as @xmath16 for any ideal @xmath17 $ ] over any field @xmath18 .    as we describe below , the `` monomial elimination axiom '' required for tropical ideals",
    "makes up for the lack of subtraction in the tropical semiring , and gives tropical ideals a rich algebraic structure reminiscent of ideals in a polynomial ring .",
    "in particular , tropical ideals seem to be better suited than general ideals of @xmath5 $ ] for studying the underlying geometry ; see remark [ rem : tropicalspectra ] .    given a polynomial @xmath19 $ ] ,",
    "its associated _ variety _ is @xmath20 if @xmath6 $ ] is an ideal , the _ variety _ of @xmath9 is @xmath21 if @xmath9 is an arbitrary ideal in @xmath5 $ ] then @xmath22 can be a fairly arbitrary subset of @xmath23 ; see example  [ e : arbitrary ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 might not even be polyhedral .",
    "however , if @xmath9 is a tropical ideal , our main result shows that this is not the case :    [ t : polyhedralcomplexintro ] if @xmath6 $ ] is a tropical ideal then the variety @xmath24 is a finite polyhedral complex .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ t : polyhedralcomplexintro ] generalizes the case where @xmath25 for a classical ideal @xmath14 : we develop a grbner theory for tropical ideals , and show that any tropical ideal has a finite grbner complex , as in @xcite*2.5 .",
    "the variety of @xmath9 is then a subcomplex of its grbner complex .",
    "a _ tropical basis _ for a tropical ideal @xmath9 is a collection of polynomials in @xmath9 the intersection of whose varieties is the variety @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that a tropical ideal of the form @xmath16 always admits a finite tropical basis ; we show in theorem [ t : tropicalbasis ] that this is in fact true for any tropical ideal .",
    "we also investigate commutative algebraic properties of tropical ideals .",
    "the fact that tropical ideals are `` matroidal '' allows us to naturally define the hilbert function of any homogeneous tropical ideal . in the case",
    "where @xmath25 for a classical ideal @xmath14 , the hilbert function of @xmath9 agrees with the hilbert function of @xmath14 . in proposition",
    "[ prop : eventuallypoly ] we show that , just as in the classical case , the hilbert function of any homogeneous tropical ideal is eventually polynomial .    the semiring @xmath5 $ ] is not noetherian , and tropical ideals are almost never finitely generated ; see example [ e : notfinitelygenerated ] .",
    "moreover , example  [ e : infinitefamily ] shows an infinite family of distinct homogeneous tropical ideals @xmath26 , all of which have the same hilbert function , such that for any @xmath7 , if @xmath27 , then the tropical ideals @xmath28 and @xmath29 agree on all their graded pieces of degree at most @xmath10 .",
    "nonetheless , tropical ideals do satisfy the following noetherian property .",
    "[ t : acc ] ( ascending chain condition . )",
    "there is no infinite ascending chain @xmath30 of tropical ideals in @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "there are several versions of the nullstellensatz for tropical geometry in the literature ; see for example @xcite .",
    "most of these concern arbitrary finitely generated ideals in @xmath5 $ ] . in our case ,",
    "the rich structure we impose on tropical ideals allows us to use the results in @xcite to get the following familiar formulation .",

    "if @xmath6 $ ] is a tropical ideal then the variety @xmath31 is empty if and only if @xmath9 is the unit ideal @xmath32 .",
    "several of our results for tropical ideals imply the analogous versions for classical ideals , simply by considering tropical ideals of the form @xmath16 for @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "since our arguments for tropical ideals are all of combinatorial nature , our approach has the appealing feature of providing completely combinatorial proofs for some important well - known statements , such as the existence of grbner complexes for classical homogeneous ideals and the existence of finite tropical bases for classical ideals .",
    "this suggests that more of standard commutative algebra can be tropicalized and extended in this manner .",
    "we conclude with a brief description of how the paper is organized .",
    "the basics of valuated matroids and tropical ideals are explained in section  [ s:2 ] . some grbner theory for tropical ideals",
    "is developed in section  [ s:3 ] , together with a discussion on hilbert functions and a proof of theorem  [ t : acc ] ( theorem  [ p : ascendingchain ] ) .",
    "tropical subschemes of tropical toric varieties are introduced in section  [ s:4 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ s:5 ] we prove theorem  [ t : polyhedralcomplexintro ] ( theorem  [ t : polyhedralcomplex ] ) , as well as the existence of finite tropical bases ( theorem  [ t : tropicalbasis ] ) and theorem [ t : tropicalnullstellensatzintro ] ( theorem  [ t : tropicalnullstellensatz ] ) .",
