    "the theoretical interest in three - hadron systems other than the traditional three - nucleon states is old . in @xcite",
    "there was a study of a possible system of @xmath7 , based only on symmetries .",
    "more recently , a possible @xmath8 bound state has been the object of intense study @xcite . however , lately there has been a qualitative step forward in this topic , made possible by combining elements of unitarized chiral perturbation theory @xmath9 @xcite with faddeev equations in coupled channels @xcite . in @xcite systems of two mesons and one baryon with strangeness @xmath10 were studied , finding resonant states which could be identified with the existing low - lying baryonic @xmath1 resonances , two @xmath11 and four @xmath12 states .",
    "similarly , in the case of the @xmath13 sector the @xmath14 appears neatly as a resonance of the @xmath15 system , as well as including the channels coupled to @xmath15 within su(3 ) @xcite .",
    "further studies , including a realistic @xmath16 amplitude beyond the @xmath17 region to which the chiral theories are limited , give rise to other @xmath13 , @xmath1 states , more precisely , the @xmath18 and the @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "developments along the same direction produced a resonant state of @xmath20 @xcite which could be identified with the x(2175 ) resonance reported by the babar collaboration @xcite and later at bes @xcite .",
    "independently , there have been similar ground - breaking studies based on variational methods @xcite . in particular , in ref.@xcite a bound state of @xmath2 with @xmath21 was found around 1910 mev in the configuration @xmath3 , suggesting a bound state of the @xmath22 and a nucleon .",
    "since the @xmath23 system couples to @xmath24 and @xmath25 to generate the @xmath26 and @xmath22 resonances , a more complete coupled channels study using faddeev equations was called for , and this was done in @xcite where it was concluded that a state appears indeed around this energy , mostly made of @xmath2 but in a mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    a @xmath27 state with these characteristics is not catalogued in the pdg @xcite .",
    "however , there is a peak in the @xmath28 reaction at around 1920 mev , clearly visible in the integrated cross section and also at all angles from forward to backward @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction has been the object of intense theoretical study @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "with respect to our present investigation , the possible signal for a new resonance from the peak of the cross section around 1920 mev was already suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , no spin and parity assignment were given , since there were several candidates in this region related to the missing resonances of the quark models .",
    "other theoretical studies do not make use of this extra state , as in @xcite , although in this latter work only resonances with mass up to 1800 mev were included . in a recent combined analysis of the @xmath0 reaction with other reactions @xcite ,",
    "a claim for a @xmath27 resonance around 1900 mev was made , however , the resonance was assumed to have @xmath29 .",
    "note in this respect that the pdg quotes in its latest edition that there is no evidence for this resonance in the latest analysis of the gwu group @xcite .",
    "the state around this energy found in @xcite has instead @xmath1 quantum numbers .",
    "as one can see , the situation concerning this state and its possible nature is far from settled . in the present work we collect several arguments to make a case in favor of the state predicted in @xcite with @xmath1 .",
    "a peak of moderate strength on top of a large background is clearly seen for the @xmath0 reaction around @xmath31 mev at all angles ( see fig . 18 of @xcite ) .",
    "one can induce qualitatively a width for this peak of about 100 mev or less . on the other hand ,",
    "if one looks at the @xmath30 reaction , one finds that starting from threshold a big large and broad structure develops , also visible at all angles ( see fig .",
    "19 of @xcite ) .",
    "the width of this structure is about 200 - 300 mev .",
    "one can argue qualitatively that the relatively narrow peak of the @xmath0 reaction around 1920 mev on top of a large background has nothing to do with the broad structure of @xmath30 around 1900 mev .",
    "a more quantitative argument can be provided by recalling that in @xcite the broad structure of the @xmath30 is associated to two broad @xmath32 resonances in their model , which obviously can not produce any peak in the @xmath0 reaction , which filters isospin @xmath33 in the final state . certainly , part of the structure is background , which is already obtained in chiral unitary theories at the low energies of the reaction @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt the position that the peak in the @xmath0 reaction is a genuine isospin @xmath33 contribution which does not show up in the @xmath30 reaction .",
    "this feature would find a natural interpretation in the picture of the state proposed in @xcite . indeed , in those works the state at 1920 mev is a @xmath34 system in relative s - waves for all pairs .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath30 reactions proceeding through the excitation of this resonance are depicted in fig .",
    "[ gpkkl ] .",
    "the two reactions are identical in this picture , the only difference being the yukawa coupling of the @xmath35 to the proton to generate either a @xmath11 or a @xmath36 .    , @xmath37 processes through the @xmath38 @xmath27 @xmath39 resonance of @xcite . ]",
    "the yukawa couplings in su(3 ) are well known and given in terms of the f and d coefficients @xcite , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the particular couplings for @xmath42 and @xmath43are e.g. given in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath44    with @xmath45 the pion decay constant .",
    "hence , the couplings are proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 vertices , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is clear that in this picture the signal of the resonance in the @xmath0 reaction is far larger than in the @xmath30 one , by as much as an order of magnitude in the case that the resonance and background contributions sum incoherently .",
    "the @xmath50 resonance used in the analysis of the @xmath0 reaction in @xcite is also used for the @xmath30 reaction in that work and also give a smaller contribution in this latter case . in the picture of @xcite",
    "the @xmath38 resonance also appears in the @xmath30 reaction but with a smaller intensity than in the @xmath0 one , as we have mentioned .",
    "the fact that a @xmath27 resonance around 1900 mev is not reported in the pdg tables finds a natural interpretation in the picture of @xcite . indeed , since most of the information about resonances is obtained from @xmath16 reactions , it is easy to understand why this resonance did not appear in these reactions",
    ". once again , in the picture of @xcite , the pion induced reactions going through the resonance would proceed in a direct way as shown in fig .",
    "[ ppn]a .     induced reactions exciting the @xmath38 resonance of  @xcite . ]    as we can see from that figure , the fact that the @xmath26 has a small coupling to @xmath24 @xcite , reflected in its small decay width , necessarily weakens the strength of the pion induced reactions producing the resonance , compared to other processes .",
    "since the wave function of the state has also an @xmath3 component , in this case the mechanism would be the one of fig .",
    "[ ppn]b , since the @xmath3 has also a small coupling to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the smallness of this coupling , and also the small @xmath51 coupling ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , make again the mechanism of production very weak .",
    "it is possible to devise some indirect method to create the @xmath52 intermediate states .",
    "one can devise the mechanisms of fig .",
    "[ kl ] .    .",
    "]    the diagram of fig .",
    "[ kl]a involves the @xmath53 transition while the one of fig .",
    "[ kl]b involves the @xmath54 one .",
    "the strength of the former amplitude is much weaker than that of the second one as one can induce from experimental cross sections @xcite and the associated amplitudes @xcite .",
    "however , the second term is penalized by the @xmath55-wave coupling @xmath56 in the loop , where the two other vertices are in @xmath57-wave . as a general rule ,",
    "loops are reduced with respect to tree level amplitudes , but in the present case the structure of these loops , with a meson - meson @xmath58 meson - meson vertex , makes the contribution very small as a direct evaluation of the diagrams shows @xcite .    in this respect",
    "it is also very illustrative to see that in @xcite a large set of reactions was analyzed , and in table 1 of the paper it was shown that the resonance around 1900 mev had a weight bigger than 1 % only in the @xmath0 and @xmath30 reactions .",
    "this means that the weight of this resonance in the @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , analysed there , is negligible .",
    "this would again find a natural explanation along the lines discussed above if one looks at the mechanisms for these reactions depicted in fig .",
    "[ gpppn ] which are all suppressed , since they always involve the coupling of the @xmath64 to @xmath65 or the @xmath66 to @xmath67",

    "in this section we make a different argumentation in favor of the interpretation of the state of @xcite .",
    "we study the angular dependence of the @xmath0 proceeding through the resonance excitation . in order to get the basic structure of the amplitude with the quantum numbers of the resonance we take a typical mechanism compatible with the nature of the resonance as having @xmath71 in s - wave and in relative s - wave with the nucleon .",

    "next we assume that we have a @xmath29 state and we show in fig .",
    "[ gpikkbarl ] the equivalent diagram to that in fig .",
    "[ gpipkkbarl ] , but assuming a @xmath29 baryonic intermediate state coupled to @xmath23 .",
    "the amplitude has now the structure @xmath81 with @xmath82 the spin transition operator from spin 3/2 to spin 1/2 .",
    "we can rewrite the amplitude taking into account the relationship @xmath83 and find @xmath84    upon sum of the modulus square of the amplitudes over initial and final spins we find now    @xmath85    we see that now we have a strong angular dependence and the biggest strength is expected for @xmath86 = 90 degrees .    although we have extracted the angular dependence from the particular model of figs .",
    "[ gpipkkbarl ] , [ gpikkbarl ] , the results are general for @xmath87 with @xmath88 a @xmath38 or a @xmath50 resonance , as one would get from the tree level amplitudes of fig .",

    "( a ) and @xmath94 ( b ) . ]",
    "next we would like to recall what happens experimentally .",
    "as one can see in ref .",
    "@xcite , the signal around 1920 mev is present at all angles and one finds roughly a contribution of the peak around @xmath31 mev over a smooth background of the order of @xmath95 for @xmath96 at all angles .",
    "this would disfavor the association of the peak to a @xmath50 resonance , since in this case at 90 degrees one would expect the maximum signal of the resonance , with a strength about @xmath97 the size of the one at forward or backward angles .",
    "the argument assumes that signal and background will sum incoherently in the reaction , which does not have to be necessarily correct , but one does not expect much coherence either in view of the many mechanisms contributing to the background in the theoretical models .",
    "we have also given some thought to the possible use of the asymmetries already measured for this reaction @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the asymmetry , @xmath12 , for the amplitude of our @xmath38 state given by eq.@xmath98([th ] ) is @xmath99 . with this value of @xmath12 , and assuming the contribution of the peak of the state over the background of about @xmath100 , we find that adding the contribution of the @xmath38 signal @xmath12 is reduced by about @xmath100 . considering that the values measured for @xmath12 in @xcite have less precision than the cross sections , @xmath101 , the changes induced in @xmath12 by the @xmath38 signal are of no much help .",
    "in case the @xmath1 assignment was correct , an easy test can be carried out to rule out the @xmath50 state .",
    "the experiment consists in performing the @xmath0 reaction with a circularly polarized photon with helicity  1 , thus @xmath102 with the @xmath103-axis defined along the photon direction , together with a polarized proton of the target with @xmath104 along the same direction . with this set up",
    ", the total spin has @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath106 is zero with that choice of the @xmath103 direction , then @xmath107 and @xmath108 must be equal or bigger than @xmath109 .",
    "should the resonant state be @xmath1 , the peak signal would disappear for this polarization selection , while it would remain if the resonance was a @xmath29 state .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the signal with this polarization set up would rule out the @xmath29 assignment .    such type of polarization",
    "set ups have been done and are common in facilities like elsa at bonn , mami b at mainz or cebaf at jefferson lab , where spin-3/2 and 1/2 cross sections , which play a crucial role in the gdh sum rule , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , were measured in the two - pion photoproduction @xcite reaction .",
    "the theoretical analysis of @xcite shows indeed that the separation of the amplitudes in the spin channels provides information on the resonances excited in the reaction .",
    "an ideal test of the nature of the resonance predicted around 1920 mev is the study of the process @xmath5 close to threshold .",
    "this reaction has received relatively good experimental attention @xcite , stimulated recently by the search of a possible pentaquark state of strangeness s=1 .",
    "theoretically it has also been studied in @xcite , also motivated by the search of the pentaquark of strangeness @xmath110 , or the nature of the @xmath111 and other resonances . yet , the emphasis here is different and the measurements required are very close to threshold , in the region below the @xmath112 production to avoid unnecessary complications in the analysis . indeed , as we mentioned , the resonance has all the @xmath113 components in s - wave and the energy is just a bit below the threshold of the reaction . the effect of this resonance should be seen as an accumulation of strength in the cross section close to threshold compared with phase space . such effects are common in many reactions @xcite . in order to see the effects expected for this case we again draw in fig .",
    "[ gpikkbarp ] a typical diagram which would contribute to the @xmath5 close to threshold through the intermediate resonance excitation .",
    "exciting the @xmath38 @xmath27 resonance of @xcite . ]    by looking at fig .",
    "[ gpikkbarp ] , in the shaded blob of the figure one is assuming all interactions of @xmath114 , which one encounters in a full faddeev calculation .",
    "hence , the amplitude for @xmath115 can be written as @xmath116 the @xmath117 amplitude was evaluated using faddeev equations in coupled channels @xcite .",
    "we are assuming that this term , which exhibits the peak due to the @xmath38 @xmath27 resonance , dominates over a possible background term close to threshold ( for instance , a tree level diagram like the one of fig .",
    "[ gpikkbarp ] omitting the interaction of the particles symbolized by the shaded blob or diagrams with two - particle final - state interactions ) .",
    "the scheme of the latter work is very rewarding for experimental tests .",
    "indeed , what one evaluates there is the @xmath118-matrix as a function of two variables .",
    "these are @xmath119 , the total energy , and @xmath120 , the invariant mass of the subsystem of two particles that one expects to be highly correlated .",
    "this is the case here , where the @xmath121 is correlated to the @xmath22 and @xmath26 resonances below the @xmath121 threshold , hence @xmath120 is taken for the @xmath121 pair .",
    "since the @xmath118 amplitude of @xcite does not have any angular dependence , and for a fixed total energy only depends on @xmath120 , the differential cross section for the @xmath5 reaction is readily found and we have    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is a constant and we have written @xmath124 for the invariant mass of the two - kaon system , the @xmath120 variable in ref .  @xcite .",

    "the results have been normalized to the same integrated cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ cross ] , we have instead represented the integrated cross section of @xmath5 as a function of the energy from threshold up to @xmath130 mev evaluated with eq.@xmath98([dsigma ] ) ( solid line ) and we compare the results with phase space ( dashed line ) .",
    "the cross section have been normalized to one at @xmath130 mev for comparison .",
    "what we observe here is that the cross section is also more pronounced at lower energies as a consequence of the presence of the three particle resonance below threshold .",
    "we should also take into account that the shape of @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ dcross ] should be expected from final - state interactions of the @xmath121 pair close to threshold , even if the @xmath134 resonance were not present @xcite .",
    "this means that instead of phase space we should already consider a @xmath118 matrix element accounting for the @xmath126 final - state interaction incorporating the pole of the @xmath64 or @xmath66 .",
    "thus we perform the evaluation of the cross section with an empirical amplitude @xmath135 with @xmath136  mev and @xmath137  mev .",
    "we note that using this amplitude we obtain a distribution @xmath138 very similar to the one obtained in fig .",

    "[ cross ] ) .    in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite the width obtained , of around @xmath139 mev , should be smaller than the one of the real state because one only has three - body states and the decay into two particles is not included .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , even if the building blocks are three particles , one can obtain a larger width for the decay into two - body systems because there is more phase space for it .",
    "because of that , in order to estimate possible uncertainties from this deficiency , we show what we would observe if we just had a resonance below threshold with a typical breit - wigner amplitude with mass @xmath140 mev and width of about 60 mev , @xmath141 the problem in this case is that the span of energies chosen in fig .",
    "[ cross ] from threshold to @xmath128  mev is only of about @xmath142 mev , smaller than the width , such that one can not see the resonance structure in such a narrow range any more .",
    "going to higher energies has the problem that we should face the @xmath112 production which has a large cross section .",
    "a way out of this problem could be found by eliminating from the experimental cross section the very narrow peak for the @xmath112 production .",
    "assuming then that there is no contribution from @xmath112 production we compare the result obtained with the amplitude of eq.@xmath98([tf0 ] ) and the one with eq.@xmath98([tf0bw ] ) which accounts also for the @xmath134 resonant pole .",

    "we observe that the effect of the @xmath134 resonance is clearly visible , with an enhanced cross section at lower energies compared with the curve that has only the @xmath126 final state .",
    "we also include in the figure the results obtained using the amplitude of eq.@xmath98([tprop ] ) ( solid line ) .",
    "the region between the two upper curves can indicate the theoretical uncertainties but we can see that , in any case , a clear enhancement due to the @xmath27 resonance is seen .    the effects observed in this calculation call for an experimental test which could verify , or eventually refute the findings obtained above based on the nature of the predicted @xmath38 state around 1920 mev .",
    "this analysis is underway at spring8/osaka @xcite .",
    "the independent prediction , also using different methods , of a @xmath38 state around 1920 mev as a bound state of @xmath34 , which appears in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 configurations , stimulated us to suggest that this state may have already been seen in the peak observed in the @xmath0 reaction around this energy .",
    "based on the structure found in @xcite we could explain why a relatively narrow peak appears in the @xmath0 reaction on top of a large background and it does not show up on top of the broader structure around these energies in the @xmath30 reaction .",
    "we could also find an easy interpretation on why the state does not show up in pion induced reactions , or in reactions with @xmath16 or @xmath68 in the final states , because of the small coupling of the @xmath4 to @xmath24 or of the @xmath3 to @xmath25 . in order to find extra support for the idea we suggested two experiments .",
    "one of them is the separation of the @xmath147 and @xmath104 parts of the @xmath28 cross section , which would rule out the @xmath50 assignment if there is no cross section in the @xmath147 channel .",
    "the other one is the investigation of the cross section close to threshold and the invariant mass distributions close to the two kaon mass , which should show enhancements close to both thresholds , indicating a bound state below the @xmath34 mass with the two kaons strongly correlated to form the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states .",

    "<S> we provide a series of arguments which support the idea that the peak seen in the @xmath0 reaction around 1920 mev should correspond to the recently predicted state of @xmath1 as a bound state of @xmath2 with a mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath4 components . at the same time we propose polarization experiments in that reaction as a further test of the prediction , as well as a study of the total cross section for @xmath5 at energies close to threshold and of @xmath6 for invariant masses close to the two kaon threshold . </S>"
