    "the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",

    "2009 ) we estimated the afterglow x  ray integral fluxes in the 2 - 10 kev rest frame common energy band and computed the corresponding rest frame x  ray luminosities at different rest frame times for all the grbs of our sample with a measured redshift .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev rest frame fluxes were computed from the observed integral 0.3 - 10 kev unabsorbed fluxes and the measured spectral index , @xmath14 , ( that we retrieved from the in the _",
    "swift_/xrt data repositories above ) in the following way ( see also gehrels et al .",
    "2008 ) :    @xmath15    the x  ray light curves were fitted with power laws , broken power laws or multiply broken power laws ( after removing the time intervals showing significant flaring ) and then the fits where interpolated or extrapolated to the given rest frame times .",

    "this plot shows that the @xmath24normalized x - ray light curves are rather clustered , with an intrinsic scatter that changes with the rest frame time . with the aim of investigating such evolution in time between the prompt and x - ray afterglow emission ,",
    "different correlations ( @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) were tested at four rest frame time .",
    "the early x - ray afterglow flux was measured at @xmath25 min and at @xmath26 hr , i.e. at the end of the prompt phase and during the expected plateau phase of the `` canonical '' x  ray light curve ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ; see also sec .",
    "3.1 ) , while the late time afterglow flux was measured at @xmath27 hr and @xmath28 hr ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we computed for each case the spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath29 ( spearman 1904 ; press et al .",

    "we note that , for the events of our sample , luminosities and energies can be correlated with redshift and this could give rise to spurious correlations .",
    "indeed , for any flux - limited sample ( as our sample is ) there will be an inevitable and tight correlation between luminosity and redshift .",
    "this arises because , for a fixed flux limit , only powerful sources can be detected out to great distances ( see , e.g. , blundell , rawlings & willot 1999 and references therein ) . in order to properly handle this problem the correlations between luminosities or between luminosity and energy",
    "should be examined excluding the dependence on redshift .",
    "this can be done with a partial correlation analysis .",
    "if @xmath31 is the correlation coefficient between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in the case of three variables the correlation coefficient between two of them , excluding the effect of the third one is    @xmath34    ( kendall & stuart 1979 ; see also padovani 1992 ) where , for our study , the coefficients 1 and 2 are @xmath16 and @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) , respectively , and the coefficient 3 is the redshift .",
    "we also performed a linear fit to each data distribution in logarithmic space .",
    "given the large scatter of the data points ( larger than the uncertainties on each value ) and that , in principle , either @xmath16 or @xmath1 ( or @xmath3 or @xmath2 ) can be assumed as the independent variable , we fit the data using the ordinary least squares bisector method ( isobe et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the list of grbs included in our sample , together with their rest frame x  ray afterglow luminosities is presented in table  1 .",
    "the results of our correlation analysis and linear fitting are reported in table 2 and plotted in fig .",
    "2 . as a general trend",
    ", we note that the afterglow x  ray luminosity at early times ( @xmath35 min and @xmath36 hr ) strongly correlate with the prompt emission quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 with null probabilities of less than @xmath37 and small dispersion ( @xmath38 dex ) . at later times ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 hr ) the correlations become less strong , although still significant ( @xmath41 ) , with an increase in the dispersion ( 0.40.5 dex ) .",
    "the correlation between the x - ray luminosity and @xmath3 seems to follow the same trend , even if in this case the significance is lower at all sampled times ( although with probabilities @xmath42 95% ) .",
    "we also tested if these correlations are affected by evolutionary effects and if their slope change with redshift .",
    "being complete in redshift , our sample represents an ideal test bench to perform this kind of check . to this end , we divided the sample into two redshift bins ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , each one consisting of 23 events and repeated the analysis described in sect .",
    "2.1 ( the results are reported in table  3 ) .",
    "no significant change ( within @xmath21 c.l . ) is found in the slopes of each individual bin with respect to the ones obtained for the whole sample , excluding any dependence on the redshift for the correlations .",
    "the so - called `` canonical '' x - ray light curve of grbs ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) shows a double broken power  law profile with an initial steep decay ( typically at @xmath45 s ) , followed by a plateau phase and ends ( at @xmath46 s ) with a `` normal '' afterglow decay . while there is general consensus on the association of the initial steep decay with the tail of the prompt emission ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ) and of the normal decay with pure external forward shock afterglow emission ( sari et al . 1998",
    "; chevalier & li 2000 ) , the nature of the plateau decay phase is still debated .",
    "the usual explanation of this phase is that the observed emission is a combination of external forward shock ( afterglow ) and energy injection coming from late - time activity of the central engine ( see , e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "however , not all the grbs display the canonical x - ray light curve but almost all the events can be described with a combination of some of the three different kind of power - law decays described above ( see , e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2009 ; bernardini et al .",
    "it has been shown that the steep decay phases can be considered equivalent independently of the morphology of the light curve where they are observed and that this is also valid for the normal decay phases ( evans et al .",
    "2009 ; bernardini et al .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in the following we will consider for our purposes also the plateau phase of the canonical x ",
    "ray light curves and the shallow decay frequently observed in the broken power - law x  ray light curves as equivalent ( as also suggested by bernardini et al .",
    "2012a ) .",
    "as discussed above , we found the strongest correlations when we compare the early time x - ray luminosity at @xmath35 min with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we plot again these early - time correlations in fig .  3 using different markers for the different light curve decay phases ( steep , plateau / shallow , normal ) .",
    "at this epoch almost 2/3 of the x - ray light curves are in the plateau / shallow decay phase ( 29 events out of 46 ) , two shows still a steep decay and the remaining ( 14/46 ) display the normal decay .",
    "this result clearly shows that the plateau / shallow phase , as the steep decay , is likely dominated by the central engine activity , as suggested by zhang et al .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the fact that at later times the fraction of events showing the normal afterglow decay increases significantly ( 80% at @xmath36 hr and more than 90% at @xmath5 hr ) together with the dispersion of the correlations .",
    "this might indicate the rise of an additional emission component , afterglow dominated .",
    "such a trend is also clear from fig .",
    "1 , where we plotted the x - ray light curves of all 46 grbs normalized by their @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "3 tells us also that a significant fraction ( 30% ) of grbs of our sample shows a normal afterglow decay already at @xmath35 min .",
    "this provides a lower limit for the rest frame time when the onset of the afterglow occurred , and implies lorenz factors of the order of @xmath47 for these events .",
    "grbs with such large values of @xmath14 are expected to be highly energetic ( sari & piran 1999 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ; mszros 2006 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2012 ) . to test this",
    "we compared the distributions of @xmath1 of the events showing a normal afterglow decay at @xmath35 min with those showing a plateau ( or a steep decay ) . althought the value of @xmath1 of grbs showing",
    "a normal decay at early time is on average higher ( by a factor of @xmath48 ) , a kolmogorv - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a 22% probability , likely indicating that the two distributions are drawn from the same population .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from the same k - s test performed on the distributions of @xmath2 , which gives a probability of 70% is a factor of @xmath48 higher for grbs showing a normal decay at @xmath35 min . ] .    combining the slopes that we found in our correlations at @xmath35 min we are in good agreement with the corresponding slopes of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 correlations ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "this is in line with the work presented by nava et al .",
    "( 2012 ) where it is shown that these two correlations hold also for our complete sample of grbs . in their analysis ,",
    "nava et al . ( 2012 ) pointed out the presence of one outlier ( grb061021 ) of the @xmath49 correlation . indeed , as can be seen in fig .  2 , we find that grb061021 is consistent with the @xmath4 and @xmath19 correlations at any time , while it falls outside the @xmath51 region of the @xmath18 correlation .",
    "we therefore argue that the inconsistency of grb061021 with the @xmath49 correlation is likely due to the hardness of its prompt emission spectrum ( high @xmath3 ) . to this regard ,",
    "we note that , being our sample limited to bright events ( sec .",
    "2 ) faint grbs like grb980425 and grb031203 are not included .",
    "these two peculiar grbs are well known outliers of both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 correlation ( while they are consistent with the three parameter @xmath52 correlation recently reported by bernardini et al .",
    "2012b and margutti et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. , painatescu & kumar 2002 ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ) that for typical afterglow parameters the x - ray band lies above the synchrotron cooling frequency @xmath53 at relatively late times ( few hours after the burst ) .",
    "furthermore , at frequencies above @xmath53 the value of the afterglow flux is independent of the circumburst density medium and , for burst with a known luminosity distance , is proportional to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the shock energy carried by the electrons and by the magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath57 is the total isotropic kinetic energy of the fireball ( sari et al . 1998 ; kumar 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the late time x  ray luminosity can be considered as a robust proxy of @xmath57 ( freedman & waxman 2001 ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ; berger 2007 ; nysewander et al .",
    "2009 ) . in light of this",
    ", the correlations between the afterglow x  ray luminosity in the 210 kev rest frame energy band and @xmath1 we found at @xmath5 hr ( table 2 ) can be used to constrain the radiative efficiency of the grb prompt emission . from eq .",
    "b9 of panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) , for grbs with known luminosity distance , the x  ray luminosity in the 210 kev rest frame energy band at @xmath58 d is :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 erg , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the electron energy distribution index ( for grb afterglows we have @xmath64 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) . replacing the rest - frame x  ray luminosities at @xmath65 hr reported in table  1 in eq .",
    "[ lum_rf ] we can thus compute the total kinetic energy for each grb of our sample and estimate the ratio @xmath66 , i.e. the radiative efficiency of the grb prompt emission . for typical @xmath55 and @xmath56 values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , and assuming @xmath69 we find an average @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , in line with the values presented in past works for long and short grbs ( freedman & waxman 2001 ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ; granot et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al . 2007 ;",
    "berger 2007 ; nakar 2007 ; nysewander et al .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath66 values for the grbs of our sample is shown in fig .",
    "according to the standard grb fireball model ( mszros 2002 and references therein ) a central engine is supposed to produce a number of relativistic internal shocks , which interact with each other giving rise to the prompt high  energy emission , while a broadband afterglow emission is expected to arise from an external shock when the relativistically expanding fireball is decelerated by the surrounding medium .",
    "the observed decrease of the significance of each correlation with time ( table 2 ) finds a natural explanation if we assume that the grb x - ray light curve is the result of a combination of different components whose relative contribution and weight change with time ( see , e.g. , willingale et al .",
    "2007 ) , with the prompt ( internal shock ) and afterglow ( external shock ) emission dominating at early and late time , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the early x - ray luminosity ( being dominated by the prompt emission ) correlate well with the prompt emission quantites @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand , at late time , the increase in the scatter of the @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 correlations can be interpreted as due to the rising of an additional component ( the afterglow ) .",
    "the statistical study of the rest - frame properties of grbs gives the best opportunity to characterize the physics of these events , although such studies are often biased by the fact that almost 2/3 of grbs are lacking a redshift measurement . in this paper , working with a sample of grbs complete in redshift ( @xmath0 ) , we investigated the existence of correlations among the grb x  ray afterglow luminosities and rest - frame prompt emission properties in an unbiased way .",
    "we tested the correlations between luminosities or between luminosity and energy performing a partial correlation analysis against the common dependence on the redshift ( see sect . 2.1 ) and obtained the following main results :    - the afterglow x  ray luminosity @xmath16 at early times ( @xmath35 min and @xmath36 hr ) strongly correlate with the prompt emission isotropic energy ( @xmath1 ) and the peak luminosity ( @xmath2 ) . at later times",
    "( @xmath39 hr and @xmath40 hr ) the @xmath4 and @xmath19 correlations become weaker ( but still significant ) .",
    "a similar trend is observed between @xmath16 and @xmath3 , even if in this case the significance of the correlation is lower at all times ( although with correlation probabilities @xmath42 95% ) .",
    "- the strongest correlations are found comparing the early time x - ray luminosity at @xmath35 min with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at this epoch",
    "the majority of the x - ray light curves display a steep or a plateau / shallow decay .",
    "this suggests that the initial steep decay and the plateau ( shallow decay ) phase observed in grb x  ray light curves are powered by activity from the central engine ;    - grbs showing the normal afterglow decay already at @xmath35 min , althought expected to have high value of the lorenz factor , do not show a significant excess in their @xmath1 and @xmath2 with respect to the other events ;    - the existence of the @xmath4 correlation at late times suggests a similar radiative efficiency ( @xmath726% ) among different bursts , where brighter bursts have on average more kinetic energy ;    - the resulting slopes of our correlation are in agreement with the amati and yonetoku correlations ( see also nava et al .",
    "the inconsistency of grb061021 with the @xmath49 correlation is likely due to the hardness of its prompt emission spectrum ( high @xmath3 ) ;    - the decrease of significance of these correlations with time indicates that the early x  ray luminosity is still dominated by the prompt emission , while at late times the most significant contribution to the x  ray luminosity is given by the external shock afterglow emission .

    "<S> we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x  ray afterglow luminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selected sub - sample of bright _ swift _ long gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) nearly complete in redshift ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> being free of selection effects ( except flux limit ) , this sample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical properties of grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way . </S>",
    "<S> the afterglow x  ray luminosities are computed at four different rest frame times ( 5 min , 1 hr , 11 hr and 24 hr after trigger ) and compared with the prompt emission isotropic energy @xmath1 , the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath2 and the rest frame peak energy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rest frame afterglow x  ray luminosity do correlate with these prompt emission quantities , but the significance of each correlation decreases over time . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with the idea that the grb x - ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination of different components whose relative contribution and weight change with time , with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we found evidence that the plateau and the shallow decay phase often observed in grb x  ray light curves are powered by activity from the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the @xmath4 correlation at late times ( @xmath5 hr ) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among different bursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the prompt emission .    </S>",
