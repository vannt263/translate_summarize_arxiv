    "ever since the seminal study by davies et al .  ( 1983 ) it is known that elliptical galaxies can be divided in two distinct classes .",
    "the bright ellipticals ( @xmath3 ) generally have a boxy appearance , are pressure supported , and often show some form of radio and/or x - ray activity .",
    "low luminosity ellipticals , on the other hand , often have disky isophotes , are rotationally supported , and generally lack significant amounts of activity ( bender 1988 ; bender et al .",
    "1989 ; nieto et al .  1988 ) . before the hubble space telescope ( hst ) came online , very little",
    "was known about the nuclear properties of these systems .",
    "based on ground - based observations , with a typical seeing of @xmath4 arcsec , ellipticals were considered to have constant density cores with a size that correlates with global galaxy properties ( e.g. , lauer 1985 ; kormendy 1985 ) .",
    "high - resolution imaging surveys with the hst , however , revealed that the central brightness profiles of early - type galaxies are well approximated by a power - law , @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( e.g. , lauer et al .",
    "1991 , 1992 ; crane et al .  1993 ; ferrarese et al .  1994 ; kormendy et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .   1995 ; carollo et al .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of @xmath2 was found to be bimodal and to follow the dichotomy of global properties inferred from ground - based observations ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; faber et al .  1997 ) and to be correlated with the global x - ray emission ( pellegrini 1999 ) .",
    "bright ellipticals have luminosity profiles that are well fit by a double power - law with a break radius of typically a few hundred parsecs .",
    "the inner power - law slope has values of @xmath7 .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the low - luminosity ellipticals whose luminosity profiles lack a clear break radius and have central power - law profiles with @xmath8 on average ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; byun et al .  1996 ; gebhardt et al .  1996",
    "; faber et al .  1997 ; quillen , bower & stritzinger 2000 ) . following the nomenclature of lauer",
    "et al .  ( 1995 ) we refer to the former as core galaxies and to the latter as power - law galaxies .",
    "in addition to the central density cusps , the images from the hst have revealed that a large fraction of early - type galaxies harbor significant amounts of dust ( @xmath9 ) , either in the form of a nuclear disk , or of a more complex , filamentary or patchy morphology ( jaffe et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al .  1995 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",
    "in several cases , nuclear _",
    "stellar _ disks with scale - lengths as small as @xmath10 pc , are found ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .  1994 ; van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1998 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "both the gaseous and stellar disks have been shown to be powerful tools for determining the central densities of their parent galaxies , and for detecting massive black holes ( harms et al .",
    "1994 ; ferrarese , ford & jaffe 1996 ; van den bosch & de zeeuw 1996 ; macchetto et al .  1997 ; bower et al .  1998 ; cretton & van den bosch 1999 ; van der marel & van den bosch 1999 ) . mainly because of these nuclear disk structures",
    "the number of galaxies with solid detections of massive black holes ( bhs ) has increased strongly over the past years , and we have reached the point where we can start to address the demographics of bhs ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 , ford et al .  1998 ,",
    "ho 1999 , van der marel 1999a , and macchetto 1999 for recent reviews ) .",
    "black holes also play an important role in connection with the observed central cusps .",
    "two different scenarios have been proposed that rely on the presence of massive black holes to explain the correlation between cusp slope and luminosity .",
    "faber et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have suggested that luminous galaxies are the result of mergers , whereby bhs in the progenitors sink to the center and excavate a core ( see also begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; makino & ebisuzaki 1996 ; quinlan 1996 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "van der marel ( 1999b ) , on the other hand , starts with the assumption of constant density cores , and shows that the adiabatic growth of central bhs can create cusps whose slopes correlate with luminosity as observed .",
    "thus , whereas the origin of the relation between cusp slope , luminosity and black hole mass is still unknown , it has become apparent that massive black holes are omnipresent in galactic nuclei .    despite the enormous wealth of new data ,",
    "we are still far from a proper understanding of the structure and formation of the central regions of early - type galaxies .",
    "not only have the new hst observations of these systems changed our view of their central regions , they have also raised several new problems :    * is the bimodality in cusp slopes real ?",
    "data on elliptical galaxies with kinematically distinct cores seems to suggest a much more continuous transition ( carollo et al .",
    "* what is the origin of the correlation between cusp slope and global characteristics of early - type galaxies ? * what fraction of early - type galaxies contain nuclear disks of stars or dust / gas , and how are these structures related to other properties of their parent galaxies ?",
    "* is there a relation between the central structure of galaxies and the presence or absence of nuclear activity ?",
    "* how does the mass of a central bh correlate with other properties as bulge mass and cusp slope , and what role do bhs play in determining the properties of the central regions of galaxies ?    in order to address these questions",
    "one needs a large and unbiased sample of early - type galaxies that have been imaged at comparable resolution . on the order of 80 early - type galaxies",
    "have been imaged with the hst , most of them before the refurbishment mission .",
    "we have obtained hst images with wfpc2 of the central regions of 67 early - type galaxies as part of our hst snap shot program # 6357 .",
    "this roughly doubles the total number of early - type galaxies that have been imaged with the hst . together with the data taken so far and with similar samples of spiral bulges ( phillips et al .",
    "1996 ; carollo et al .  1997b ; carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 ) and radio galaxies ( de koff et al .  1996",
    "; mccarthy et al .  1997 ; martel et al .  1999 ; verdoes kleijn et al .",
    "1999 ) these images provide a data base for the investigation of correlations of properties such as dust , metallicity , colors , activity , and nuclear structure .    in this paper , the first in a series , we present the data and describe the luminosity profiles and isophotal structures .",
    "more detailed analyses of the dust , stellar disks , and the central parameter relations are deferred to future papers .",
    "the sample is compiled from the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , by selecting all early - type galaxies with radial velocities less than @xmath11 , an absolute @xmath12-band magnitude less than @xmath13 , and absolute galactic latitude exceeding 20 degrees ( to minimize the effects of galactic extinction ) . in total 130 galaxies",
    "made it into the sample , of which 68 have been observed successfully by hst .",
    "thus , although our sample is by no means complete , it has been homogeneously selected .",
    "one galaxy , ugc  5467 , turned out to be a spiral galaxy and will be discarded in what follows .",
    "note that , although we have attempted to discard obvious duplicates ( wfpc2 ) from our sample , several of our objects have been observed in other hst programs since the time our sample was selected . in most cases , however , a different filter was used than for the data presented here .",
    "global properties of the 67 galaxies in our sample , taken from the leda ( see paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) , are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "absolute magnitudes ( column  2 ) are based on the distances listed in column  4 , and based on the virgo - centric infall corrected heliocentric velocities assuming @xmath14 ( see paturel et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",
    "in addition , we list the 1.4 ghz radio fluxes , taken from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; cordon et al .",

    ". de vaucouleurs et al .  1991 ) . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the q60 @xmath18 m and 100 @xmath18 m iras fluxes measured by one of us , adopting a similar approach to that taken by knapp et al .",
    "we used the wfpc2 to obtain broad band images of the galaxies in our sample , using the f702w filter .",
    "this filter , centered on @xmath19@xmath20 and with a fwhm of @xmath21 , was chosen to compromise between maximizing the number of photons and minimizing the effects of dust on the observed morphologies .",
    "the nuclei of the galaxies were centered on the planetary camera ccd ( pc ) , which consists of @xmath22 pixels of @xmath23 each .",
    "all exposures were taken with the telescope guiding in fine lock , yielding a rms telescope jitter of @xmath24 milli - arcseconds .",
    "more detailed information on the wfpc2 can be found in biretta et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "previous hst / wfpc2 observations of ellipticals have shown that the power - law galaxies have typically a central surface brightness in the @xmath12-band of @xmath25 , whereas core - galaxies typically have @xmath26 .",
    "our aim is to obtain a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 20 or larger in the center of the galaxies .",
    "this prompted us to use a total exposure time of 1000 seconds with the analogue - to - digital gain set to 13.99 electrons / dn ( dn is the number of counts ) . with this setting the read - out noise",
    "is @xmath27 electrons . to facilitate cosmic ray removal , and to guard against saturation in the presence of a bright nuclear point source , each exposure was split in two separate exposures of 300 and 700 seconds respectively .",
    "the images are calibrated by the hst calibration ` pipeline ' maintained by the space telescope science institute .",
    "the standard reduction steps include bias subtraction , dark current subtraction and flat - fielding , and are described in detail by holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "subsequent reduction is done using standard iraf tasks . using the data quality files and the wfixup task ,",
    "bad pixels are corrected by means of a linear one - dimensional interpolation .",
    "the alignment between the 300 and 700 exposures is determined by comparing the isophote centers from initial analyses of the separate exposures .",
    "if the misalignment is significant the 300 sec exposure is shifted appropriately , using linear interpolation .",
    "a difference - image of the 700 sec and ( shifted ) 300 sec images is used to check the accuracy of the alignment .",
    "next , the two images are combined with simultaneous removal of cosmic rays , using the iraf task imcombine .",
    "the cosmic ray removal and bad pixel correction is checked by inspection of the residual images between the cleaned , combined image and each of the two original frames .",
    "sky levels are determined from empty areas in the wf images , and accordingly subtracted .",
    "the sky - level is found to be small , typically @xmath28 dn .",
    "the count rates in the broad - band f702w images are calibrated to magnitudes in the landoldt @xmath0-band , as described in holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995b ) , and assuming a @xmath12-@xmath0 color of @xmath29 .",
    "the magnitudes thus derived are checked using the inverse sensitivity and the zero point of the magnitude scale provided by the hst pipeline , whereby it is assumed that ellipticals have the spectrum of a k - iii giant .",
    "the consistency is found to be better than 0.01 dex .",
    "the 300 and 700 sec exposures are reduced separately as well .",
    "cosmic rays are removed using the iraf task cosmicray .",
    "these images are used to check the consistency of structures , for obtaining estimates of the uncertainties due to random noise , and for cases where saturation has affected the 700 sec exposure ( see   [ sec : lumprof ] ) .    despite the high spatial resolution of the refurbished hst ,",
    "the central few tenths of an arcsec of the galaxies are influenced by the effects of point - spread function ( psf ) smearing .",
    "because of the stability of the hst psf , these effects can be corrected for by means of deconvolution with the richardson - lucy ( rl ) algorithm ( lucy 1974 ) . based on tests with model galaxies",
    "( see   [ sec : models ] below ) we deconvolve the reduced 300 sec , 700 sec and combined images of each galaxy with 40 iterations of the rl algorithm . for three galaxies with faint and shallow surface brightness profiles ( ngc  3613 , ngc  4168 and ngc  4365 ) , the rl - algorithm with 40 iterations ends up amplifying the noise too strongly for an accurate analysis of the central surface brightness profile , and only 15 iterations are used in these cases . for each galaxy",
    "we use a separate model psf @xmath30 , created with the tinytim software package ( krist 1992 ) , centered on the location of the galaxy s center in the pc ccd .",
    "contour plots of the deconvolved images are presented in the appendix .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze the isophotal structure and luminosity profiles of the galaxies . for the isophotal analysis we use the isophote fitting task ellipse in iraf . for each isophote , the center , ellipticity ( @xmath31 ) , and position angle ( @xmath32 )",
    "are computed .",
    "in addition , the third and fourth order deviations of the isophote from a pure ellipse are determined .",
    "these are described by the amplitudes ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath35 ) of the sin and cos @xmath36 and @xmath37 terms of the following fourier expansion ( see jedrzejewski 1987 ) : @xmath38\\ ] ] for a perfectly elliptical isophote these coefficients are all equal to zero .",
    "typically the absolute values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are small , rarely exceeding @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 coefficient is of special interest , since positive ( negative ) @xmath40 values correspond to disky ( boxy ) isophotes .    in order to parameterize the luminosity profiles",
    "they are fitted with a double power law , known as the `` nuker''-law profile ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) : @xmath41^{(\\gamma-\\beta)/\\alpha}\\ ] ] which has @xmath42 at @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 describes the sharpness of the break from the outer to the inner power law .",
    "the break - radius , @xmath47 , is the radius of maximum curvature in log - log coordinates , and @xmath48 is the surface brightness at @xmath49 . the nuker law has been shown to accurately fit the central luminosity profiles of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , byun et al .",
    "note that equation  ( [ nukerlaw ] ) is only intended to fit the luminosity profiles in the inner @xmath50 of early - type galaxies .",
    "for typical fitted values of @xmath51 there must be a further downturn in the profile at larger radii for the total luminosity to be finite .      in order to test the accuracy of our reduction and analysis we constructed a large set of model galaxies .",
    "each model galaxy has a luminosity profile of the form of equation  ( [ nukerlaw ] ) , has constant ellipticity and position angle , and has perfectly elliptical isophotes ( i.e. , @xmath52 for @xmath53 ) .",
    "a fake image is created by integrating the model surface brightness distribution over each pixel , and by adding photon and read - out noise .",
    "pixel sizes are taken the same as for the true data .",
    "the frame size of @xmath54 pixels is smaller than the actual hst images , but satisfies the requirements for our testing purposes .",
    "the resulting image , refered to as ` unconvolved ' image , is convolved with the hst psf ( the ` convolved ' image ) , and subsequently deconvolved using @xmath55 iterations of the rl algorithm ( the ` deconvolved ' image ) .",
    "the psfs used for the convolution and deconvolution are constructed with tinytim , and differ slightly from each other in order to mimick errors in the exact psf shape .",
    "the unconvolved and deconvolved model images are analyzed in the same way as the data : an isophotal analysis is performed , and we fit the nuker - law profile to the major axis luminosity profile determined from the isophote fitting . the deconvolution is tested with 10 , 15 , 25 , 40 and 80 iterations .",
    "the best results were obtained for @xmath56 , in good agreement with lauer et al .",
    "however , for galaxies with shallow central surface brightness profiles @xmath57 already suffices to accurately recover the unconvolved image , and more iterations only amplify the noise .    in total",
    "we have constructed @xmath58 model galaxies .",
    "each of the 15 sets of model galaxies is characterized by a value of @xmath2 , ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in steps of @xmath61 . for each",
    "set 50 model galaxies are created whose luminosity profile parameters are varied at the few percent level .",
    "the ellipticity and orientation of each model galaxy are chosen randomly from the intervals @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] , respectively .",
    "in addition , the center of the galaxy , in fractional pixels , is drawn randomly as well .    in figure",
    "[ fig : modeliso ] we plot the isophotal parameters of one of the model galaxies with @xmath64 .",
    "even though this model intrinsically has @xmath65 over its entire radial range , the ellipticities found by the isophote - fitting routine are significantly lower for @xmath66 , even for the unconvolved image ( solid triangles ) .",
    "in addition , the higher - order parameters become noisy and reveal fluctuations inside this radius .",
    "these effects owe mainly to the discrete pixel sampling and the sub - pixel interpolation used by the isophote - fitting routine , and indicate that one can not trust the isophotal parameters for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 pixels ) .",
    "note , however , that the isophotal parameters of the deconvolved model galaxy are remarkably similar to those of the unconvolved model , indicating that the deconvolution routine used does not introduce spurious artefacts .    in order to examine the accuracy with which we can recover the nuker parameters of the luminosity profile used as input for the model , we first focus on the unconvolved images . for each model",
    "@xmath69 we compute @xmath70 with @xmath71 the input surface brightness profile ( in magn .",
    "arcsec@xmath72 ) of equation  ( [ nukerlaw ] ) , and @xmath73 the major axis lumninosity profile determined from the isophotal analysis of the unconvolved image . for each of the 15 sets of model galaxies ( that have the same value of @xmath2 ) , we then compute the average @xmath74 and the corresponding standard deviation @xmath75 , where the average is over the 50 models in each set .    figure  [ fig : deltamu ] plots @xmath76 and @xmath75 for 8 of the 15 sets . for @xmath77",
    "the luminosity profiles derived from the isophotal analysis are in excellent agreement with the intrinsic profile . for smaller radii",
    ", however , the error increases strongly , especially for the profiles with steep central cusp slopes .",
    "even more worrysome is that the average residual @xmath78 strongly deviates from zero at small radii , implying that the main contribution to the error is of systematic rather than random nature .",
    "this is a reflection of the problems with the isophotal analysis due to the discrete , pixelized nature of the data and the sub - pixel interpolation .",
    "as jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) already pointed out , the sub - pixel interpolation scheme used can introduce spurious artefacts especially when the gradients in the luminosity profiles are large ( i.e. , when they are steeply cusped ) .    clearly , when determining the intrinsic central cusp slopes of galaxies one can not use the surface brightness profiles determined from the isophotal analysis .",
    "we therefore use a different approach .",
    "for @xmath79 we fit the nuker law profiles ( equation  [ [ nukerlaw ] ] ) directly to the major axis luminosity profile determined from the isophotal fit to the image . for @xmath80 , however , we extract the actual pixel values of the image from the data , which we compare to the model predictions given by @xmath81 with @xmath82 the nuker law profile and @xmath83 here @xmath84 are the coordinates centered on the galaxy center @xmath85 with the @xmath86-axis rotated by an angle @xmath87 with respect to the pixel coordinate system , and @xmath88 and @xmath87 are the ellipticity and position angle of the isophotes inside @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath88 , and @xmath87 are all constant inside @xmath89 and we compute their values as the average of the corresponding isophotal parameters in the radial interval from @xmath89 to @xmath92 . in cases where the isophotes in this radial range are not representative of the galaxy , e.g. , distorted by dust , a different more appropriate radial range is chosen .",
    "the advantage of this method is that by using the observed pixel values to determine the best fit nuker profile we do not suffer from any problems with sub - pixel interpolation which hampers a proper isophotal analysis at small radii .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that if the actual isophotal parameters vary with radius inside @xmath89 , this will introduce systematic errors in the parameters of the best fit nuker law profile . however",
    ", detailed tests , described below , show that these errors are much smaller than those stemming from sub - pixel interpolation .",
    "note that a somewhat similar scheme was used by byun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who used the total integrated light inside @xmath93 as an additional constraint for the nuker - law fitting procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : modelsb ] illustrates the advantage of our new method .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the intrinsic major axis luminosity profile of the same model as in figure  [ fig : modeliso ] ( i.e. , with @xmath64 ) .",
    "the upper profiles with the filled circles correspond to the luminosity profiles determined from the isophotal analysis .",
    "as is evident , inside @xmath94 the sub - pixel interpolation used by the isophotal analysis introduces systematic errors .",
    "note again that the results for the unconvolved ( left panels ) and deconvolved ( right panels ) model images are virtually identical , indicating that the deconvolution procedure used can accurately correct for the psf smearing .",
    "the lower profiles with open symbols , offset by 1.5 magn , correspond to the luminosity profile determined with the new method .",
    "the open circles ( @xmath95 ) are the luminosities determined from the isophotal analysis .",
    "the open squares correspond to the actual pixel values of the model image inside @xmath89 defined such that @xmath96 , i.e. , the difference between the pixel value and the nuker - law profile at @xmath97 is equal to the difference between the actual pixel value and the prediction @xmath98 of the best - fit model . this way the residual is accurately visualized .",
    "] . as is evident from the lower panels , this new method allows us to recover the intrinsic luminosity profile with high accuracy down to very small radii .    in order to determine the parameters of the nuker law profile that best fits the data we use a @xmath99-minimization technique . for a given set of parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath51 , @xmath2 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , we determine @xmath100 . here",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 are the @xmath99-values of the pixel - value fitting inside @xmath89 and the luminosity profile fitting at @xmath103 , respectively . as errors we use poisson statistics for the pixel values and the nominal errors given by the isophotal analysis , respectively . in practice ,",
    "these latter errors are underestimated , as is evident from the fact that the normalized @xmath102 of the best fit model is typically significantly more than unity .",
    "we therefore introduce the parameter @xmath104 , which scales the nominal error given by the isophotal analysis , and which thus sets the relative contributions of @xmath101 and @xmath102 to the total @xmath99 of the fit . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : fchi ]",
    "we plot the average difference between the intrinsic cusp steepness @xmath105 and the best - fit nuker - law profile @xmath106 , as function of @xmath104 for the set of models with @xmath107 .",
    "the averages are taken over all 50 model galaxies in this set . as expected , the fits are better for @xmath108 .",
    "a value of @xmath109 yields values for @xmath106 in good agreement with @xmath105 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "too much relative weight is given to the pixel values inside @xmath89 , and @xmath106 is too large .",
    "for too large @xmath104 , @xmath99 is completely dominated by the isophotal luminosities outside @xmath89 and the central cusp slope becomes poorly constrained , as is evident from the large errorbars . in what follows",
    "we therefore adhere to @xmath111 , for which in general we find a normalized @xmath99 of the best fit model close to unity .",
    "we have constructed luminosity profiles for all 750 deconvolved model images using our new method , and determined the best fit nuker law parameters using the @xmath99-minimization technique described above with @xmath111 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fchi ] we plot @xmath106 versus @xmath105 for all 750 models .",
    "as is evident , this method of analyzing luminosity profiles allows an accurate determination of the central cusp slope , and we use the same method to analyze the luminosity profiles of the actual hst images .",
    "for each galaxy there are six reduced images : the non - deconvolved and deconvolved 300 sec , 700 sec , and combined images .",
    "an isophotal analysis on each of these six images is performed .",
    "all images are checked for contamination such as cosmic rays that have not been properly removed , foreground stars , dust filaments , and bright globular clusters . if necessary , these objects are masked out .",
    "ten galaxies are so severely influenced by dust that meaningful estimates of their luminosity profiles and isophotal structures can not be obtained ( all galaxies with filamentary dust of `` type '' iii as well as ngc  4233 and ngc  4494 , which have a large dust disk , see ",
    "[ sec : dust ] below ) . in most of the following discussion",
    "we discard these galaxies and focus on the sample of 57 galaxies for which the hst images provide a meaningful picture of the structure of the stellar component . in what follows",
    "we refer to this sub - sample as the _ unperturbed _ sample .",
    "isophotal parameters are determined down to @xmath112 , and presented in the appendix .",
    "note that , although we plot the isophotal parameters down to @xmath113 , only the parameters for @xmath114 are considered for further analysis . for comparison , the isophotal parameters of the deconvolved image ( open circles ) are overplotted with the ones of the non - deconvolved image ( solid triangles ) . at larger radii , unaffected by convolution effects , the latter data , which is less noisy ,",
    "nicely complements the deconvolved data .",
    "previous high - resolution imaging with the hst has revealed that the central regions of early - type galaxies are very complex environments .",
    "this is strikingly confirmed with our sample , and is clearly reflected in the isophotal parameters : the isophotal shapes can vary strongly with radius and are very different from one galaxy to the other .",
    "this makes it very hard to categorize the central regions of early - type galaxies in a small number of classes .",
    "it has become customary to classify ellipticals as either disky or boxy , depending on the sign of the @xmath40-parameter .",
    "this generally works well for the outer parts of ellipticals , where the changes in the isophotal shape are only modest .",
    "however , the central regions reveal a vastly more complex behavior",
    ". a single galaxy can have isophotes that change from disky to boxy and back to disky all within the inner @xmath115 , even when there are no signs of dust .",
    "clearly , a bimodal classification does not suffice to describe the bewildering variety of morphologies apparent in the inner @xmath116 .",
    "another approach is therefore employed : rather than classifying galaxies as either disky or boxy a simple letter coding , referred to as _",
    "isophotal code _ , is used to describe the individual isophotal shapes of each galaxy .",

    "more detailed investigations of their properties are required to see if they make up a truly , physically distinct class of objects , or whether these galaxies are distinct from both the core and power - law galaxies only because of distance and/or resolution effects .      in fourteen galaxies we find radial intervals with strong isophote twists , non - zero fourth order moments ( @xmath121 and/or @xmath40 ) and local ellipticity maxima .",
    "a clear example is ngc  2699 where at @xmath173 from the center the isophotes reveal an isophote twist of @xmath174 , both @xmath121 and @xmath40 are positive , and there is a local maximum in ellipticity . in some cases",
    "the orientation angle of the misaligned structures changes with radius , giving it the appearance of spiral arms ( e.g. , eso  443 - 39 , ngc  3595 , and ugc  4551 ) , wheras in other cases ( eso  378 - 20 , eso  443 - 39 , eso  447 - 30 , ngc  2950 and ugc  6062 ) misaligned structures are evident in two distinct radial intervals . a clear example is eso  447 - 30 with misaligned structures at both @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in each of these galaxies ,",
    "the two misaligned structures are not only misaligned with the host galaxy , but also with each other .    given the highly elongated nature of these structures and the fact that disks are common in elliptical galaxies , it is tempting to interpret these structures as stellar disks whose orientation axes are misaligned with those of the host galaxy .",
    "however , disks in spheroidal systems can only be stable if their symmetry axis is perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the potential , which does not result in a projected misalignment as observed .",
    "if , on the other hand , a stellar disk is embedded in a triaxial galaxy , projection effects can easily accommodate the observed misaligned morphologies .",
    "furthermore , if the axis ratios of the triaxial host galaxy vary with radius , the projected angle of misalignment can vary with projected radius . such configuration , therefore , can explain the multiple misaligned structures observed .",
    "a problem with this explanation , however , is that all 14 galaxies with misaligned structures are power - law galaxies which are generally thought to be spheroidal systems .",
    "furthermore , if these structures are disks the observed fraction of disks embedded in power - law galaxies is too high ( see   [ sec : disks ] below ) .",
    "a more likely explanation , therefore , is that these misaligned structures correspond to bars .",
    "this lends great support from the fact that isophotal structures , very similar to those seen here , have been observed in barred spirals and s0s ( e.g. , wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ; friedli et al .",
    "1996 ; erwin & sparke 1999 ) . in particular , the bars within bars found by these authors provide a natural explanation for the multiple misaligned structures found in some of our galaxies . indeed , both kormendy ( 1981 ) and wozniak et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have previously noted the complex morphological structure of ngc  2950 ( one of the fourteen galaxies in our sample with misaligned structures ) and classified it as a double - barred galaxy .",
    "the bar interpretation is further supported by the fact that ten of the fourteen galaxies in our sample with misaligned structures are classified as s0 or e / s0 ( see table  [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , how to interpret the misaligned structures in the four galaxies classified as ellipticals , although it is not inconceivable that these galaxies may be misclassified s0s seen close to face - on .",
    "detailed investigations into the kinematics of these galaxies are required to confirm that indeed these structures correspond to tumbling triaxial potentials .      in total 29 out of the 57 galaxies ( 51 percent ) in our unperturbed sample",
    "reveal disky isophotes over at least a small radial interval ( this includes the misaligned structures discussed in   [ sec : misdisk ] ) .",
    "this diskiness is most straightforwardly interpreted as due to an embedded stellar disk ( e.g. , scorza & bender 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the diversity of disk structures in our sample is large , ranging from extremely thin and small disks in the very center ( i.e. , ngc  3613 ) up to very large disks spanning the entire radial interval imaged ( i.e. , ngc  4621 ) . in 18 galaxies the isophotes are disky in only a single radial interval , whereas the other 11 galaxies have disky isophotes in two radial intervals , separated by purely elliptical or boxy isophotes .",
    "this `` double - diskiness '' may be due to a nuclear disk inside the central hole of a separate outer disk or ring ( i.e. , van den bosch & emsellem 1998 ) , reflect the projected surface brightness contribution of a single disk which is locally dwarfed by that of the spheroidal , or be due to a bar - within - a - bar structure ( see   [ sec : misdisk ] ) .",
    "the observed isophotal structure of an elliptical galaxy with an embedded stellar disk depends strongly on the ratio of the surface brightness distributions of the two components and on the inclination angle of the disk .",
    "detailed disk - bulge decompositions ( i.e. , scorza & bender 1995 ; scorza & van den bosch 1998 ) are required to decompose the observed surface brightness in the separate components , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    given the large fraction of early - type galaxies that reveal evidence for an embedded disk , and the fact that these disks are only visible if the disk is seen under a sufficiently large inclination angle , implies that the true fraction of early - type galaxies with embedded stellar disks is likely to be significantly larger than the @xmath177 percent found here . in our unperturbed sample ,",
    "@xmath178 percent of all power - law galaxies have some amount of diskiness .",
    "this is a surprisingly high fraction .",
    "if we assume that all power - law galaxies have embedded disks , and that these disks are only detectable if their projected minor - to - major axis ratio is smaller than @xmath179 , one only expects to detect disks in @xmath180 percent of all power - law galaxies ( see rix & white 1990 for a detailed discussion on the detectability of embedded stellar disks ) .",
    "the observed fraction of @xmath178 percent implies either of the following : ( i ) all disks with a projected axis ratio smaller than @xmath181 are detectable ( assuming that all power - law galaxies harbor embedded disks ) , ( ii ) power - law galaxies are always seen under high inclination angles , ( iii ) the steep central cusp owes to the projection of the highly flattened structure ( but see lauer et al .  1995 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , or ( iv ) in some cases the diskiness is due to highly elongated prolate or triaxial structures ( i.e. , bars ) rather than oblate disks .",
    "we only consider the latter of these explanations viable .",
    "it is supported by the fact that fourteen of our power law galaxies have their diskiness misaligned with the main galaxy . as we discussed in the previous section",
    ", these structures are most likely due to bars in s0 galaxies .",
    "if we exclude these fourteen galaxies , we find embedded disks in only @xmath182 percent of our power - law galaxies , which is in excellent agreement with the @xmath180 percent expected if all power - law galaxies harbor embedded disks , but which are only detectable if the disk s projected axis ratio is smaller than @xmath179 .",
    "although the nuker - law in general provides a good fit to the observed surface brightness of the central regions of early - type galaxies , in several cases the very centers reveal excess light , associated with an increase in slope as the hst resolution limit is approached .",
    "we follow lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and refer to these features as _",

    "these galaxies have massive black holes as well , and their intrinsically high stellar densities will only aid in disrupting any merger remnant that might reach the center of the potential well .",

    "limit the actual slope of the luminosity profile is steeper than @xmath185 , and it is unclear whether to classify these systems as core or power - law galaxies .",
    "although the isophotal properties are similar to those of the core galaxies , there is a hint that the luminosities of these galaxies are intermediate between those of the core and power - law galaxies .",
    "we therefore provisionally classify these galaxies as ` intermediate ' .",
    "however , it is unclear at present whether these galaxies make up a physically distinct class or whether distance and/or resolution effects cause them to loose their distinct core and/or power - law characteristics .",
    "f97 have pointed out that the distribution of central cusp slopes is clearly bimodal : whereas ( by definition ) core galaxies have @xmath128 , power - law galaxies are found to have @xmath187 .",
    "the region @xmath188 is virtually devoid of galaxies .",
    "this bimodality closely follows the dichotomy in other properties : the core galaxies make up the bright end of the luminosity function and typically have boxy isophotes , whereas the power - law galaxies are fainter and typically have disky isophotes .",
    "we confirm this dichotomy with our sample : 93 percent of all galaxies that reveal disky isophotes are power - law galaxies , whereas 77 percent of all core galaxies have either boxy or purely elliptical isophotes .",
    "furthermore , we confirm the bimodality of cusp slopes , but we do find a significant population of galaxies with @xmath189 . combined with the class of intermediate galaxies , which have cusp slopes at the resolution limit that also fall in this range , we thus conclude that the bimodality is not as strong as previously claimed .",
    "finally , the statistical properties of our sample can be summarized as follows :    * in 15 percent of the galaxies in our sample we detect dust disks with diameters that range from @xmath156 to @xmath157 . together with the 28 percent of the galaxies in which we detect filamentary dust , the total detection rate of dust is 43 percent , in good agreement with previous estimates based on hst data ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) . * in 9 galaxies we find evidence for nuclei .",
    "these are defined as ( largely ) unresolved , nuclear surface brightness spikes that cause a central upturn in the luminosity profiles .",
    "our detection rate of nuclei ( 13 percent ) is substantially less than the 36 percent found by lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in their sample , but this is most likely a reflection of our more conservative approach to identifying nucleation . whereas the nuclei in power - law galaxies are most likely stellar , the nucleation seen in core galaxies is generally non - thermal emission from an active galactic nucleus . * in 14 galaxies we find structures that are misaligned with the principal axes of the host galaxy .",
    "these structures are most likely associated with stellar bars in s0 galaxies . in 5 of these galaxies ,",
    "multiple misaligned structures are apparent indicating bars within bars . * a large fraction ( 51 percent ) of the early - type galaxies in our unperturbed sample",
    "reveal disky isophotes over at least a small radial interval , whereas this fraction increases to almost 70 percent when only considering power - law galaxies .",
    "this is a remarkably large fraction : even if all power - law galaxies were to harbor an embedded stellar disk , one would not expect to detect these thin structures in more than @xmath190 percent of all cases because of inclination effects . if , however , we exclude the cases where the diskiness is misaligned with the main galaxy , and which are more likely associated with stellar bars",
    ", we find that @xmath191 percent of all power - law galaxies reveal some amount of diskiness .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which _ all _ power - law galaxies harbor an embedded stellar disk .",

    "<S> we present high resolution @xmath0-band images of the central regions of 67 early - type galaxies obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . </S>",
    "<S> this homogeneously selected sample roughly doubles the number of early - type galaxies that have now been imaged at hst resolution , and complements similar data on the central regions of radio galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our sample strikingly confirms the complex morphologies of the central regions of early - type galaxies which have become apparent from previous studies with hst . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we detect dust , either in the form of nuclear disks or with a filamentary distribution , in 43 percent of all galaxies , in good agreement with previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find evidence for embedded stellar disks in a remarkably large fraction of 51 percent . in 14 of those galaxies the disk - like structures are misaligned with the main galaxy , suggesting that they correspond to stellar bars in s0 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the luminosity profiles of the galaxies in our sample , and classify galaxies according to their central cusp slope . to a large extent </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the results from previous hst surveys in that early - type galaxies reveal a clear dichotomy : the bright ellipticals ( @xmath1 ) are generally boxy and have luminosity profiles that break from steep outer power - laws to shallow inner cusps ( referred to as ` core ' galaxies ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fainter ellipticals , on the other hand , typically have disky isophotes and luminosity profiles that lack a clear break and have a steep central cusp ( referred to as ` power - law ' galaxies ) . the advantages and shortcomings of classification schemes utilizing the extrapolated central cusp slope @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> are discussed , and it is shown that @xmath2 might be an inadequate representation for galaxies whose luminosity profile slope changes smoothly with radius rather than resembling a broken power - law . thus we introduce a new , alternative parameter , and show how this affects the classification . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find evidence for an ` intermediate ' class of galaxies , that can not unambiguously be classified as either core or power - law galaxies , and which have central cusp slopes and absolute magnitudes intermediate between those of core and power - law galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it is unclear at present , however , whether these galaxies make up a physically distinct class or whether distance and/or resolution effects cause them to loose their distinct core or power - law characteristics . </S>"
