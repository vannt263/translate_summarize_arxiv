    "the discovery of planets within binary star systems has recently sparked an increased interest in their formation , occurrence frequency and dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "several techniques exist to detect additional bodies accompanying binary stars .",
    "in addition to the traditional radial velocity technique , @xcite outlines the possibility to infer such planets from microlensing observations .",
    "recently , transiting circumbinary planets have been detected using the kepler space telescope @xcite .",
    "furthermore , companions can be detected from pulsar timing measurements @xcite .",
    "the formation and dynamical evolution of planets around binary star systems have been the subject of recent theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "utilising ground - based observations , a number of multi - planet systems around short - period eclipsing binary stars have been proposed in recent years @xcite . from measuring the times at minimum light ( either primary and/or secondary eclipse )",
    "one can use the light - travel time ( ltt ) effect to detect additional companions by measuring periodic changes in the binary period @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other detection methods ( radial velocity , microlensing and transit ) the ltt technique is sensitive to massive companions on a long - period orbit : the semi - amplitude @xmath1 of the ltt signal scales with the companions mass and period as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "in addition , low - mass binary components will favour the detection of low - mass companions on short - period orbits @xcite .    from ground - based photometric observations ,",
    "the first two - planet circumbinary system ( hw virginis , a.k.a hw vir ) was proposed by @xcite .",
    "additional multi - body systems of planetary nature were subsequently proposed by @xcite ( nn serpentis , a.k.a nn ser ) , @xcite ( uz fornacis , a.k.a .",
    "uz for ) and @xcite ( hu aquarii , a.k.a .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a quadruple system with two circumbinary sub - stellar companions orbiting the algol - type binary sz hercules ( a.k.a .",
    "sz her ) .    for a secure detection of a multi - planet circumbinary system ,",
    "at least two criteria need to be satisfied .",
    "first , any period variation , due to additional companions , must be recurring and periodic in time .",
    "the data should extend over at least two complete cycles of the longest period .",
    "second , the proposed system should be dynamically stable on time scales comparable to the age of the binary components . @xcite",
    "first studied the dynamical stability of the two planets in hu aqr .",
    "their study allowed them to conclude that the system is highly unstable with disruption times of a few hundred years .",
    "subsequent studies of the same system were carried out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion of these studies is that the planets , as proposed in the discovery work , are simply not feasible .",
    "more observational data is necessary before any further constraints can be imposed on the orbital parameters of any companions in the hu aqr system .    the proposed planets orbiting the close binary system",
    "hw vir @xcite is another case where the proposed planets do not stand up to dynamical scrutiny @xcite . in that case , the dynamical character of the hw vir system was studied , and the planets proposed were found to follow highly unstable orbits most likely due to their crossing orbit architecture and relatively high masses .",
    "however , @xcite presented new timing measurements of hw vir allowing them to conclude stable orbits under the assumption of fixing some of the orbital elements in their least - square analysis .",
    "the nn ser system was also recently studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors found stable orbits for the @xcite solutions , if the planets are locked in a mean - motion resonant ( mmr ) configuration .",
    "however , an in - depth remodeling of the timing data renders the system unstable when all parameters are allowed to vary freely .",
    "very recently , @xcite published additional timing data of nn ser .",
    "their re - analysis allowed them to conclude the existence of two companions orbiting the binary pair involved in a 2:1 mmr .",
    "unstable orbits in proposed multi - body circumbinary systems have not only been found among companions of planetary nature .",
    "the sz her system with two sub - stellar mass companions was recently investigated within a dynamical analysis @xcite . here , the authors also found that the proposed companions followed highly unstable orbits .    in a recent work , @xcite interpreted observed eclipse timing variations of the post - common envelope binary nsvs14256825 as being the result of a pair of light - travel time effect introduced by two unseen circumbinary companions",
    "the proposed companions are of planetary nature , with orbital periods @xmath4 and @xmath5 years , and masses of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "once again , however , a recent study @xcite reveals that the proposed planetary system would be dynamically unstable on very short timescales - with most plausible orbital architectures being unstable on timescales of just a few hundred years , and only a small fraction of systems surviving on timescales of @xmath8 years .",
    "the aim of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the available timing data of nsvs14256825 , which forms the basis of our analysis .",
    "in particular we augment the timing measurements presented in @xcite with three additional data points presented in @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the light - travel time model using jacobian coordinates and outline the derivation of the minimum mass and projected semi - major axis for a single circumbinary companion along with a short description of our least - squares minimisation methodology . in section 3 ,",
    "we carry out a data analysis and perform a period analysis based on fourier techniques and present our results describing the main properties of our best - fit solutions . in particular , we present results from finding a best - fit linear , best - fit quadratic and best - fit one - companion model .",
    "finally , we summarise our results and discuss our conclusion in section 4 .",
    "as the basis of this work we consider the same timing data set as published in @xcite . however , we noticed that three timing measurements published in @xcite were not included in @xcite .",
    "we have therefore carried out two independent analysis based on the following data sets .",
    "_ dataset i _ : data as presented in table 3 in @xcite .",
    "this data set spans the period from june 22 , 2007 to august 13 , 2012 , corresponding to an observing baseline of around 5 years .",
    "_ dataset ii _ : data as presented in table 3 in @xcite _ plus three data points _",
    "( primary eclipse ) from @xcite .",
    "the additional points are as follows .",
    "bjd @xmath9 days , bjd @xmath10 days and bjd @xmath11 days . the second data set spans the period from june 10 , 1999 to august 13 , 2012 , corresponding to an observing baseline of around 13 years ( i.e. , doubling the time window ) .",
    "the aim of considering the second data set ( dataset ii ) is to investigate the effect of the additional timing data on the overall best - fit solution and compare the results obtained from considering the first data set ( dataset i ) since it covers a longer observing baseline .",
    "the time stamps in @xcite are stated using the terrestrial time ( tt ) standard while the times in @xcite states timing measurements in the barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) standard .",
    "however , the difference between these time standards ( tt vs tdb ) introduces timing differences on a milli - second ( approx .",
    "0.002s ) level due to relativistic effects @xcite . in light of the quoted measurement uncertainties ( from the literature ) of the eclipse timings in the two data sets ,",
    "the two time stamps ( tt and tdb ) can be combined and no further transformation of one time standard to the other is necessary .    considering the binary as an isolated two - body system and in the absence of mechanisms that cause period variations ,",
    "the linear ephemeris of future ( or past ) eclipses @xmath12 is given by @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath14 denotes the cycle number , @xmath15 is the reference epoch and @xmath16 is the nominal binary period .",
    "additional effects that cause variations of the binary period would be observed as a systematic residual about this best - fit line .",
    "we use the formulation of the light - travel time effect based on jacobian coordinates @xcite . in the general case",
    "a circumbinary @xmath17-body system is a hierarchical system and employing jacobian elements therefore seems natural .",
    "this is particularly true for the case of a single companion ( the first object in a hierarchical multi - body ensemble ) , where the jacobian coordinate is equivalent to astrocentric coordinates and readily returns the geometric osculating orbital elements of the companion relative to the binary .",
    "here we assume the binary to be a single massive object with mass equivalent to the sum of the two component masses .",
    "for a single circumbinary companion the ltt signal can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the speed of light and @xmath20 is given as @xmath21,\\ ] ] here @xmath22 denotes the orbital eccentricity and @xmath23 measures the argument of pericentre of the companion relative to the combined binary representing the dynamical centre .",
    "the eccentric anomaly is given as @xmath24 .",
    "following @xcite the semi - amplitude of the ltt signal is given as @xmath25 with @xmath19 measuring the speed of light , @xmath26 the semi - major axis , @xmath27 the inclination of the orbit relative to the skyplane . the quantities",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the masses of the combined binary and companion , respectively .    in summary ,",
    "the set @xmath30 represent the five free osculating orbital parameters for the companion with @xmath31 and @xmath32 denoting the orbital period and time of pericentre passage , respectively .",
    "these latter two quantities are introduced implicitly via kepler s equation and the eccentric anomaly @xcite      once a weighted least - squares best - fit model has been found the minimum mass of the companion is obtained from solving the following transcendental function    @xmath33    where @xmath34",
    "the projected minimum ( with @xmath35 ) semi - major axis ( @xmath36 ) is then found from kepler s third law @xmath37 where the gravitational parameter is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 denoting gauss gravitational constant .",
    "the combined mass of the two binary components is assumed to be @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "considering only the case of a single circumbinary companion , the timings of minimum light for primary eclipses is given as @xmath41 we therefore have a total of seven model parameters describing the light - travel time effect caused by a single circumbinary companion . for a description of two companions we refer to @xcite .",
    "the ltt signal is a one - dimensional problem similar to the radial velocity technique .",
    "we therefore only derive the minimum mass and minimum ( projected ) semi - major axis of the companion . for simplicity",
    ", we henceforth write @xmath29 and @xmath26 for the minimum masses and minimum semi - major axis of the companion and @xmath42 - but in standard papers dealing with eclipse timing or radial velocity studies authors use the shortened versions , for brevity . ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that no gravitational interactions have been taken into account in the above formulation of the ltt signal .",
    "only keplerian motion is considered .",
    "it is possible to include additional effects ( such as mutual gravitational interactions ) that can cause period variations and we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "finally , we stress that the case of a _ single _ companion the jacobian - based description of the one - companion ltt effect is equivalent to the formulation given in @xcite .",
    "hence , the @xmath43 should be identical to those parameters obtained using the @xcite ltt model along with the derived minimum mass .",
    "the only parameter which is different is the semi - major axis of the binary due to the different reference systems used and we refer the reader to @xcite for details . for consistency",
    ", we tested our results for the presently ( jacobian ) derived ltt formulation using the procedure detailed in @xcite , and obtained identical results .",
    "however , one complication could arise in the argument of pericentre which can differ depending on the defined direction of the line - of - sight axis .",
    "either this axis can point towards or away from the observer .",
    "the difference will affect the argument of pericentre and can be rectified using the relation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the argument of pericentre defined in a reference system with opposite line - of - sight direction compared to the formulation outlined in @xcite .",
    "hence the difference is only a matter of convention and does not affect the quantitative results obtained from the two formulations .",
    "we have implemented the jacobian - based kepler - kinematic ltt model in idl .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt ( lm ) least - square minimisation algorithm was used to find a best - fit model and is available via the ` mpfit ` routine @xcite .",
    "we quantify the goodness of fit statistic as    @xmath46    where @xmath17 is the number of data points , @xmath47 measures the vertical difference between the observed data and the computed model at the @xmath48th cycle , and @xmath49 measures the 1-sigma timing uncertainty ( usually obtained formally ) .",
    "however , in this work we will quote the _ reduced _",
    "@xmath0 defined as @xmath50 with @xmath51 denoting the degree of freedom .",
    "the ` mpfit ` routine attempts to minimise @xmath0 iteratively using @xmath52 free parameters .    in the search for a global minimum @xmath53 of the underlying @xmath0",
    "space we utilise a monte carlo approach by generating a large number @xmath54 of random initial guesses .",
    "two approaches can be used to explore the @xmath0 space for a global minimum .",
    "the first involves generating random initial guesses in a relatively narrow region of a given parameter and may be applied when information about the periodicity and amplitude of the ltt signal is inferred from other means ( e.g. fourier analysis ) .",
    "for example , if a fourier analysis reveals a given frequency within the data one can then generate random initial guesses from a normal distribution centred at that period with some ( more or less narrow ) standard deviation for the variance . in the second approach ,",
    "random initial guesses are generated from a uniform distribution defined over a broad interval for a given parameter .",
    "however , in both approaches we randomly choose the eccentricity from a uniform distribution within @xmath55 $ ] with the argument of pericentre chosen from @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "in all our searches we recorded the initial guess and final parameters along with the goodness - of - fit value , the corresponding root - mean - square ( rms ) statistic and formal 1-sigma uncertainties .",
    "a single lm iteration sequence is terminated following default values of accuracy parameters within ` mpfit ` or after a maximum of 3000 iterations ( rarely encountered with the average number of iterations required being just 11 ) .",
    "as a starting point for our analysis , we first determined the parameters of the linear ephemeris ( @xmath57 ) by calculating a linear least - squares regression line to the same data ( dataset i ) as considered by @xcite .",
    "a best fit line resulted in a @xmath58 with @xmath59 free parameters and @xmath60 data points .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 value was found to be 853 and the ( rounded ) linear ephemeris was determined to be    @xmath61    for dataset ii we obtained the slightly different ephemeris , with little improvement in the precision of the binary period @xmath62 we applied the ` period04 ` @xcite lomb - scargle algorithm on the residual data ( fig .",
    "[ periodstudy ] ) obtained from subtracting the best - fit line , and compared two fits to the residual data .",
    "the first had a single fourier component , whilst the second had two fourier components as shown in fig .",
    "[ periodstudy ] .",
    "the two - component fit was found to provide a better description of the data .",
    "we show the corresponding power spectra in fig .",
    "[ powerspec ] , and find the 6.9 year period to be in agreement with the period found by @xcite .",
    "however , the algorithm was unable to detect the 3.5 year cycle ( inner proposed planet ) as determined in @xcite .",
    "instead , we found a 20.6 year cycle with a detection six times above the noise level .",
    "in some cases a change of the binary period can be caused by non - gravitational interaction between the two components of a short - period eclipsing binary .",
    "often the period change is described by a quadratic ephemeris ( linear plus secular ) with the times of primary eclipses given by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a period damping factor @xcite which can account for mass - transfer , magnetic braking , gravitational radiation and/or the influence of a distant companion on a long - period orbit .",
    "following @xcite the rate of period change , in the case of mass - transfer , is then given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 denoting the currently measured binary period .",

    "similar results were obtained for the remaining two parameter combinations .",
    "considering dataset i we found the average period change to be @xmath76 .",
    "this value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the period decrease reported in @xcite .",
    "to reliably assess the validity of a two - companion model we first considered a one - companion model .",
    "our period analysis yielded a shortest period of around @xmath77 years ( 2557 days ) with a semi - amplitude of @xmath78 days ( 20 seconds ) .",
    "we therefore searched for a best - fit solution in a narrow interval around these values by seeding 523,110 initial guesses .",
    "the best - fit solution with @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1bodylttjacbestfit ] . in table [ bestfitparam ] we show the corresponding best - fit parameters and derived quantities for the companion along with their formal ( derived from the covariance matrix ) @xmath69 uncertainties as obtained from ` mpfit ` .",

    "we note that several of the parameters correlate with each other .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath83 pair shown in fig .",

    "we therefore suspect that our best - fit model resides within a local minimum .    to test",
    "whether we are dealing with a local minimum we explore the @xmath0 parameter space on a wider search grid by following the approach as outlined previously .",
    "surprisingly , we found a marginally improved solution with a smaller best - fit @xmath88 value of 1.96 , a reduction by @xmath89 compared to the first best - fit solution of 1.98 .",
    "computing the @xmath82 space around the new best - fit solution over a large interval in the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 resulted in fig .  [ 2dscansthreefigures ] .    in each panel ,",

    "we have omitted quoting the formal uncertainties for reasons that will become apparent shortly . in fig .  [",

    "up to this point our analysis allows us to conclude that the data is not spanning a sufficiently long observing baseline to firmly constrain the parameters of a single companion model .",
    "we stress that the model itself could still be valid . with the data currently at hand it is impossible to establish firm confidence intervals on the parameters .",
    "our first solution ( comparable with the solution presented in @xcite ) likely represents a local minimum in the @xmath106 parameter space , or appears to be a solution within the @xmath69 confidence interval characterised by a shallow topology of @xmath0 space .",

    "we have noted that three datapoints from @xcite were not included in the analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "although they are accurate ( placing them well on the linear ephemeris ) their timing precision is lower .",
    "however , the large timing uncertainty for these points should not disqualify them from being included in the analysis . in principle , the precision of the eclipsing period @xmath16 should increase for a dataset of increased baseline , and could eventually help to constrain any long - period trend .",

    "[ bestfitsolutiondataset2 ] we are not convienced about any additional light - travel time periodicity above the rms level of about six seconds .",
    "a light - travel time signal with amplitude of around six seconds would require a dataset with rms of about one second or less .",

    "extending our search grid of @xmath0 parameter space resulted in a similar best - fit @xmath106 statistic with significantly different orbital characteristics ( table  [ bestfitparam_extended ] ) .",
    "we were able to show quantitatively that the present timing data does not allow us to firmly constrain a particular model with well - established parameter confidence limits . in light of this , quoting formal errors for the model parameters seems meaningless .",
    "we concluded that the best - fit solution found by @xcite most likely represents a local minimum .",
    "we explain the lack of constraint in the parameters by the limited monitoring baseline over which timing data was acquired .",
    "dataset i represented a baseline of about 5 years .",
    "if a periodicity is present , the principle of recurrance should apply , requiring two full orbital periods to be covered in order to establish firm evidence for the presence of a companion .",
    "this would correspond to a light - travel time period of at most 2.5 years for dataset i and 6 years for dataset ii ( spanning about 13 years ) .",
    "however , for dataset i , the data did not allow models with periods shorter than @xmath108 days . simultaneously",
    "dataset ii does not constrain the period any better than dataset i.    our analysis did not allow us to find convincing evidence of a second light - travel time signal .",
    "the rms scatter of timing data around the best - fit model was found to be around 5 seconds .",
    "signals with a semi - amplitude comparable with the measurement uncertainties seem unlikely to be supported by the present data .",
    "the claimed second companion in @xcite has a semi - amplitude of @xmath109 seconds .",
