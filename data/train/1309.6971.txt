    "a wide array of observations , ranging from the distribution of matter on cosmological distances , to the rotation curves of galaxies on kiloparsec scales , suggest that the universe contains a form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and whose pressure is negligible . at present , the nature of this dark matter is unknown , but , among other hints , the former phenomenological properties strongly suggest that dark matter is made of non - relativistic particles that couple very weakly to the standard model .",
    "there is certainly no shortage of particle dark matter models accommodating these properties , such as axions , moduli , gravitinos , kaluza - klein excitations , sterile neutrinos or wimps , just to name a few @xcite . in each different model ,",
    "dark matter experiences a different cosmic evolution , resulting in a distribution of dark matter momenta that is often thermal at late times , although with temperatures that span many orders of magnitude in the different dark matter scenarios . given the great variety of dark matter models and associated thermal histories , it is thus natural to ask whether we can place phenomenological limits on the dark matter temperature today , or whether in fact there is evidence that dark matter has a non - zero temperature .",
    "indeed , several authors have suggested that warm dark matter ( see below ) may help alleviate the apparent tension between the predictions of the cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) scenario and the actual amount of clustering on sub galactic scales @xcite , although recent studies suggest that warm dark matter is disfavored by observations @xcite .",
    "similarly , the same small - structure problems may also be avoided if cold dark matter kinetically decouples rather late in cosmic history , as described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "phenomenological bottom - up limits on cdm like the one we discuss would not only constrain many of the different cold dark matter models , but also offer us a generic model - independent way to further characterize the properties of dark matter .    in this article",
    "we explore model - independent limits on the dark matter temperature to mass ratio extrapolated to the present time , @xmath0 .",
    "this ratio determines the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles , which is a parameter that directly controls the growth of structure . if dark mater decouples while non - relativistic , dark matter particles travel at a root - mean - square velocity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dark matter mass . as a result ,",
    "anisotropies on scales much smaller than the associated free - streaming length are strongly suppressed , a phenomenon usually known as landau damping .",
    "the absence of such suppression on observable scales thus places limits on the dark matter temperature to mass ratio .",
    "whereas it turns out to be convenient to frame our limits in terms of the dark matter temperature , they can be equally interpreted as limits on the root - mean - square dark matter velocity . in this context , we should also point out that our limits apply even if dark matter does not consist of elementary point particles , but , instead , is made of objects of even macroscopic size , provided that their velocity dispersion is maxwellian .    in order to reliably calculate the impact of a non - zero dark matter temperature on the formation of structure , we restrict ourselves to linear perturbation theory , and thus focus on cosmological probes applicable in this regime : the cmb and the matter power spectrum on the appropriate scales .",
    "the same suppression of structure implied by a non - zero temperature also impacts the smallest scales that become non - linear , and , thus , the mass of the smallest proto - halos .",
    "several authors have studied how the latter depend on the mass parameters of specific dark matter models , such as wimps in supersymmetric or extra - dimensional models , but in these cases the corresponding scales are too small to be probed observationally @xcite .",
    "interactions between dark matter particles and the thermal bath in the early universe may also imprint features on the matter power spectrum on sub - horizon scales at the time of kinetic decoupling @xcite .",
    "these interactions may lead to a suppression of small scale structure that is stronger than that due to free streaming on those scales , although they do not have any impact on modes outside the horizon at that time . because the data used in our analysis only probe modes that entered the horizon at @xmath3 , these features are absent in the modes of interest if kinetic decoupling occurred at @xmath4 , an assumption typically satisfied in most dark matter models .",
    "in fact , a recent analysis of cosmological data does not find any evidence for features due to dark matter interactions @xcite , further suggesting that cosmological scales must have been outside the horizon at the time of kinetic decoupling . in that case , and in the context of our analysis , we can simply assume that cold dark matter is effectively collisionless .",
    "signatures of dark matter interactions are then buried in small scales , beyond the reach of our cosmological data .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 , and any quantity derived from it , should be carefully interpreted . by the former",
    "we mean the temperature to mass ratio dark matter would have today in the absence of structure formation . in the real universe , however ,",
    "dark matter inhomogeneities grow , become non - linear and collapse , resulting in virialized dark matter haloes whose temperature is determined just by the properties of the halo . in pure cold dark matter models",
    "the press - schechter mass function predicts that all of the dark matter ends up in such halos @xcite .",
    "if the dark matter temperature is non - zero there is a cut - off in the matter power spectrum at small scales , implying that only a fraction of dark matter collapses , but we expect this fraction to be significant for small enough temperatures .",
    "hence , our ratio @xmath0 is not the temperature of a typical dark matter particle in today s universe , but just an extrapolation of what that ratio would be had dark matter not collapsed .",
    "the work in the literature closest to the limits we discuss here has mainly focused on constraints on the mass of warm dark matter particles @xcite . in these models ,",
    "dark matter is typically assumed to be hot , in the sense that it decouples kinetically while being relativistic , whereas in our work we assume that dark matter is cold , and thus decouples while non - relativistic . because the parameter that actually affects the formation of dark matter structure is the velocity dispersion , in order to relate the latter to the dark matter mass ,",
    "previous analyses have typically needed to introduce additional assumptions tied to the particular dark matter model being considered , such as the chemical potential of dark matter , its thermal history , or its number of degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "mass limits only apply strictly in the context of the models in which they were derived , and can not be readily extended to other scenarios .",
    "the present work focuses instead on the dimensionless ratio of temperature to dark matter mass directly , and basically relies on just two assumptions : that the distribution of dark matter momenta is maxwellian after the time the smallest relevant scales entered the horizon , and that dark matter has been collisionless at least since that time .",
    "we assume that dark matter consists of collisionless particles , which for simplicity and without loss of generality we take to be spinless . as we pointed out in the introduction",
    ", these particles do not have to be point - like : as far as our analysis is concerned , the only restriction is that their size be much smaller than any other length scale in the problem .    under these conditions , dark matter is then characterized by its distribution function @xmath5 , which counts the number density of particles at coordinate time @xmath6 , comoving coordinate @xmath7 and covariant momentum @xmath8 .",
    "since we assume these particles to be collisionless , their distribution function @xmath9 obeys the collisionless boltzmann equation @xmath10=0,\\ ] ] in which the zero on the right hand side accounts for the absence of non - gravitational interactions .    because we assume that dark matter is non - interacting , its only observable effects involve gravitation .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of a distribution of dark matter particles characterized by @xmath5 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the determinant of the space - time metric .      in a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker universe with space - time metric @xmath13,\\ ] ]",
    "the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann nc ] ) reads @xmath14 hence , any homogeneous and isotropic distribution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a solution of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann background ] ) .",
    "because we want to describe cold dark matter , we assume that the distribution function describes a gas of non - relativistic particles , and therefore choose it to be the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the mass of the dark matter particles , @xmath18 is the temperature of dark matter today , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential today , at @xmath20 .",
    "the temperature @xmath18 determines the mean kinetic energy of the dark matter particles  and hence their mean square velocity @xmath21and the chemical potential determines the number density of dark matter particles at present . if dark matter has @xmath22 degrees of freedom , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) should be multiplied by @xmath22 .",
    "since this amounts to a change in the chemical potential @xmath19 , which in our approach is a free parameter anyway , we can set @xmath23 without loss of generality .    because in many models dark matter is in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , the distribution ( [ eq : mb ] ) is fairly generic .",
    "if @xmath24 is the four - velocity of a comoving observer , then @xmath25 is the energy of a particle with four - momentum @xmath26 in the rest frame of the observer .",
    "hence , the distribution function @xmath27 reduces to the distribution ( [ eq : mb ] ) in the non - relativistic limit @xmath28 , and remains a solution of equation ( [ eq : boltzmann background ] ) , provided that the temperature and chemical potential scale appropriately , @xmath29 indeed , in order for the distribution to remain time - independent the dark matter temperature has to be inversely proportional to the scale factor , because in the non - relativistic limit @xmath30 . with this temperature scaling , and in order to again preserve a time - independent distribution , the chemical potential has to be given by the equation above .",
    "note however that a thermal distribution of the form ( [ eq : thermal ] ) only solves the collisionless boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann background ] ) either in the relativistic or non - relativistic limits , but not in both .",
    "hence , our choice of the distribution ( [ eq : mb ] ) is justified if dark matter particles kinetically decoupled while non - relativistic .",
    "this is indeed what happens for instance if dark matter consists of wimps . in this case , although dark matter typically decouples chemically from the thermal bath while mildly non - relativistic , at @xmath31 , interactions with standard model particles keep dark matter particles in equilibrium with the thermal bath until much later @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most treatments of warm dark matter models assume that dark matter consists of fermionic particles which kinetically decouple while highly relativistic , and thus assume that the distribution function follows a ( non - gaussian ) fermi distribution with vanishing chemical potential , @xmath32^{-1}$ ] .    since in the @xmath33cdm cosmological model dark matter particles",
    "are assumed to be cold , we usually calculate their energy - momentum tensor in the strict non - relativistic limit @xmath34 , in which their energy density @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 here , we go beyond this non - relativistic limit and calculate the energy - momentum tensor and its perturbations to first order in @xmath37 . inserting equation ( [ eq : mb ] ) into ( [ eq : emt ] ) we find @xmath38 and , similarly , the pressure becomes @xmath39 these expressions capture just what we expect from a gas of non - relativistic particles in an expanding universe .",
    "note that @xmath40 vanishes and @xmath41 is diagonal , both because of rotational invariance .",
    "the correction factors to the conventional results arise from the thermal average of @xmath42 , which decays as @xmath43 because physical momenta redshift with the scale factor .",
    "it is easy to check that the energy density and pressure above satisfy the conservation equation @xmath44 .",
    "the equation of state parameter of this fluid is @xmath45 which decays with the square of the scale factor , and is proportional to the small parameter @xmath37 .",
    "some authors have constrained the equation of state parameter @xmath46 of dark matter @xcite , but they typically assume that @xmath46 is a constant , rather than proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "the expressions above are valid only at late times , in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "as we proceed back in time the momenta of the dark matter particles increase , and thus become relativistic .",
    "as long as dark matter particles remain collisionless , the distribution function ( [ eq : mb ] ) remains a solution of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann background ] ) .",
    "therefore , substitution of equation ( [ eq : mb ] ) into equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) leads , to all orders in @xmath37 , to the energy density @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the corresponding modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath49 scales as in equation ( [ eq : t scaling ] ) . in the limit @xmath50 the energy density scales like that of relativistic particles , whereas in the limit @xmath51 the energy density approaches the limit ( [ eq : nr limit ] ) .",
    "our next goal is to derive an equation that captures the impact of a non - zero temperature on the evolution of the dark matter density perturbations . under different assumptions and approximations ,",
    "such an equation has been derived many times in the literature , which extends as far back as to the pioneering work of gilbert @xcite , the author after whom the equation is mostly named .",
    "most of the relatively recent derivations of the gilbert equation have focused on warm dark matter particles , which decouple while relativistic ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although a few analyses have also considered particles that decouple while non - relativistic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our derivation here relies on the linearized and relativistic boltzmann equation in synchronous gauge , and does not involve any approximations beyond an expansion in @xmath52 , a small parameter in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "our gilbert equation can thus be incorporated directly into existing numerical boltzmann codes to calculate cmb anisotropy and matter power spectra in the linear regime .    in order to study the evolution of structure",
    "when dark matter has a non - zero temperature , we perturb the homogeneous and isotropic frw metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) , @xmath53 ,      \\quad      h_{ij}=\\frac{k_i k_j}{k^2 } h+6 \\left(\\frac{k_i k_j}{k^2}-\\frac{1}{3 } \\delta_{ij}\\right)\\eta,\\ ] ] in which we have chosen synchronous gauge , and we concentrate on the perturbation caused by a single fourier mode of wave vector @xmath54 .",
    "to calculate the perturbed energy momentum tensor , we need to perturb the background distribution ( [ eq : thermal ] ) .",
    "let us write the perturbed distribution function as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the thermal distribution ( [ eq : thermal ] ) and @xmath57 is the magnitude of the spatial momentum , @xmath58 note that @xmath57 depends on the metric , so @xmath56 also contributes to the perturbations of the distribution function .",
    "then , the perturbation @xmath59 obeys the linearized boltzmann equation @xmath60 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath57 in this case , and einstein s summation convention is implied even if repeated indices are not in opposite locations .",

    "note that during radiation domination , the product @xmath74 is constant , and thus roughly agrees with its value at matter - radiation equality .",
    "we obtain the perturbed energy momentum tensor @xmath75 by substituting the solution ( [ eq : delta f ] ) into equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) .",

    "the exponential arises from the moments of spherical bessel functions with respect to the gaussian distribution in equation ( [ eq : mb ] ) , and is thus sensitive to the precise form of the distribution function .",
    "because the comoving free streaming length @xmath79 depends on the dark matter temperature , the absence of such suppression allows us to place quite stringent constraints on @xmath37 .",
    "the cdm density contrast @xmath80 contains an additional correction due to the non - zero dark matter temperature , but the impact of this correction is typically much smaller than that due to the free - streaming term .",

    "for instance , as we mention in appendix [ sec : calculation ] , collisionless dark matter does not undergo acoustic oscillations , even if the dark matter particles have a non - zero velocity dispersion , and thus , a non - zero pressure .",

    "we begin by carrying out the integrals over the angular part of the covariant momentum variable @xmath8 , which we compute using the formula @xmath285=4\\pi",
    "p^2\\left[\\delta_{ij}\\frac{j_1(v)}{v}-           \\hat{v}_i \\hat{v}_j j_2(v)\\right],\\ ] ] where a hat denotes unit vector in the corresponding direction and @xmath286 and @xmath287 are spherical bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "we then proceed to evaluate the integral over the magnitude of the momentum , @xmath288,\\ ] ] which has a closed analytic form because for the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ eq : mb ] ) , @xmath289 is a gaussian . to calculate the integral in the last equation it suffices to know the generating functions      from which integrals with higher even powers of @xmath57 can be calculated by formal differentiation with respect to @xmath291 . in particular , every additional power of @xmath292 in our non - relativistic expansion yields relative corrections of order @xmath0 and @xmath293 .",
    "hence , such an expansion is justified provided that both quantities are small .",
    "the structure of the exponential in equations ( [ eq : generating ] ) suggests that we define @xmath294 , which in the non - relativistic limit results in the definition of the streaming length in equation ( [ eq : d def ] ) .",
    "thus , the analysis in the last paragraph reveals that our approximations are valid as long as @xmath28 and @xmath295 . using equations ( [ eq : generating ] ) in ( [ eq : an integral ] ) and substituting into ( [ eq : begin integral ] ) we finally arrive at equation ( [ eq : delta rho ] ) . the derivation of equations ( [ eq : v ] ) , ( [ eq : delta p ] ) and ( [ eq : pi ] ) is completely analogous .",
    "it is also illustrative to check how the specific form of the distribution function affects these results . instead of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ eq : mb ] ) , let us assume that @xmath56 is instead @xcite @xmath296 which is the high - momentum limit of both the fermi and bose distributions . in this case , the generating functions analogous to those in equation ( [ eq : generating ] ) are @xmath297 the structure of these integrals thus suggests identifying the free streaming length with @xmath298 , which differs from the definition in equation ( [ eq : d def ] ) . in both cases , however , the free streaming length is proportional to the root mean square velocity of the particles , namely , @xmath299 for a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , and @xmath300 for the distribution ( [ eq : high p ] ) . on length scales smaller than this free - streaming length , there is again a suppression of structure , but instead of exponential , as in ( [ eq : generating ] ) , the suppression here is polynomial .    to conclude this section we still need to show that the contributions to the energy - momentum tensor of the term @xmath277 in equation ( [ eq : delta f ] ) are negligible .",
    "consider for that purpose the energy density .",
    "let us assume that dark matter decouples with a thermal distribution with vanishing chemical potential while ( mildly ) non - relativistic , as in wimp models . then , at or shortly before decoupling we have @xmath301      \\frac{\\delta t(\\tau_\\mathrm{dec},\\vec{k})}{t_\\mathrm{dec}}.\\ ] ] substituting this expression into equation ( [ eq : emt ] ) and integrating over momenta as before we find @xmath302\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2 } d^2(\\tau,\\tau_\\mathrm{dec})k^2\\right),\\ ] ] which again shows the expected exponential suppression of structure due to free streaming .    for adiabatic perturbations",
    "we expect the temperature perturbation to be of the same order as the density perturbation in photons @xmath303 . on super - horizon scales the latter and",
    "the gravitational potentials are given by @xmath304 hence , because the time derivatives of the potentials grow linearly in time , the contribution from the integral in equation ( [ eq : delta rho ] ) is always larger than that of equation ( [ eq : delta rho dec ] ) , as long as the corresponding mode was super - horizon sized at decoupling .",
    "for the same reason , and under the same assumption , the integral in equation ( [ eq : delta rho ] ) is not very sensitive to the time of decoupling , which can be taken to be zero .    equation ( [ eq : delta rho dec ] ) also illustrates an important property of an ensemble of collisionless particles . in the absence of gravity , equation ( [ eq : delta rho dec ] ) is the energy density associated with the solution of boltzmann s equation with the corresponding initial conditions . in the case of a perfect fluid with a non - zero pressure",
    ", we would expect such a solution to describe acoustic oscillations , but equation ( [ eq : delta rho dec ] ) instead shows exponential decay on scales smaller than the free - streaming length if the gas is collisionless .",
    "if we had carried out an analogous calculation with massless particles , we would have found that the energy density is proportional to @xmath305 $ ] .",
    "this function does in fact oscillate in time ( albeit with a decaying amplitude ) , but the corresponding frequency is @xmath306 , instead of @xmath307 , the acoustic oscillation frequency for a fluid of relativistic particles .",
