    "some developments of quantum gravity ( qg ) suggest a smallest length scale for the structure of space - time , or equivalently , an upper energy bound for particles in the quantum geometrical background  @xcite .",
    "the most natural candidate for the minimal length appears to be the planck length @xmath3  m ( or correspondingly , the planck energy , @xmath4  gev , for the maximal energy of particles ) .",
    "these typical constants can arise from the combination of the quantum ( @xmath5 ) , the relativity ( @xmath6 ) , and the gravity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in such scenarios , the lorentz symmetry of space - time breaks down at quantum - gravitational scale , and this might leave `` relic '' effects at relatively lower energies and modify low energy physics with extra terms  @xcite",
    ".    however , there arises an apparent puzzle  it is well - known that in the special relativity ( sr ) , the length of an object transforms between two observers with relative movements according to lorentz - fitzgerald contraction , so in whose reference frame is the smallest length scale which is mentioned above measured ?",
    "this problem is deeply related to an essential property of physical laws among inertial frames , the so - called principle of relativity , which is regarded as a milestone in the progress of physics . however , in the domain of quantum gravity physics , it is not obvious that this principle still holds firmly . instead , it deserves the most careful contemplations .",
    "amelino - camelia  _ et al .",
    "_ suggested a way to reconcile the paradox between the relativity and the minimal length  @xcite .",
    "there are two constants that are preserved in such a theory , so it is usually called `` doubly special relativity '' ( dsr )  @xcite .",
    "dsr preserves the relativity between inertial frames , whereas deforms the lorentz algebra with nonlinear actions as a cost .",
    "consequently , the well - known dispersion relation for a particle in sr , @xmath8 , has to be modified in the form with extra qg imprints , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a parameter believed to be of the order of the planck length .",
    "meanwhile the laws of transforming energy and momenta between different inertial observers are also explicitly deformed in dsr .",
    "hence it is possible that a single energy or momentum scale is invariant .",
    "we should emphasize that modified lorentz transformations in momentum space can have physically substantial effects , even though the modifications for different kinds of particles are identical , since the departure from sr can manifest its effects when we measure and compare physical observables in different conditions ( for detailed discussions , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that such modifications lead to many further predictions which can be tested in a series of experiments .",
    "one serious example is the energy - dependence of light speed , and its effect is relevant to @xmath11-ray burst observations  @xcite , some corrections to the predictions of inflationary cosmology  @xcite and dark energy  @xcite . indeed , although some theoretical calculations motivate the modification of the dispersion relation , the fact that a modified dispersion relation is experimentally measurable by itself is a more exciting reason to take it into serious consideration .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the law of composition of momenta in sr has to be modified together with the modification of the dispersion relation , since the theory is relativistic with two invariant quantities , and accordingly the role of integration over energy - momentum space is modified .",
    "there are some studies  @xcite on the effects from the modified dispersion relation on a photon gas . in our paper",
    ", we study the modified thermodynamics of the photon gas in the framework of dsr , with more careful considerations compared to previous studies .",
    "we properly include the effects of the modified dispersion relation , the deformed integration measure , and the upper energy - momentum bound .",
    "we find that the number of available microstates is modified and consequently thermodynamical quantities are altered in dsr .",
    "we show that with a positive parameter @xmath1 , the grand partition function , the energy density , the specific heat , the entropy , and the pressure of the photon gas are smaller than those of sr , while the velocity of photons and the ratio of pressure to energy are larger .",
    "in contrast , with a negative @xmath1 , the quantum gravity effects show up in the opposite direction . however , these effects only manifest themselves significantly when the temperature is larger than @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we review the procedure to get the dispersion relation for the photon gas in the framework of dsr proposed and generalized by magueijo and smolin  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we derive the modified integration measure and the grand partition function of the photon gas . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we study various thermodynamical quantities of the photon gas in details , and the cases @xmath13 and @xmath14 are compared with those of sr ( @xmath15 ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we provide summaries of the paper .",
    "theoretically , dsr itself can not decide the dispersion relation used to describe the real nature , whereas only experiments can pick out the right formula  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the current status of observations is incapable to draw a decisive conclusion .",
    "however , promising observations are emerging  @xcite and many possibilities to modify the dispersion relation in the framework of dsr have already been proposed .    in this paper ,",
    "the model we adopt is dsr2 , which was proposed and generalized by magueijo and smolin  @xcite .",
    "this model introduces a nonlinear modification to the action of the generators of lorentz group in momentum space , and this renders the theory to be compatible with an observer - independent length scale .",
    "the modified boost generators are given as  @xcite @xmath16 l_0^{\\ i } u [ p_0],\\ ] ] where @xmath17 are the standard generators of lorentz group , and @xmath18 $ ] is defined as @xmath19(p_a)=\\frac{p_a}{1-\\lambda p_0},\\ ] ] with the parameter @xmath1 believed to be around the planck length scale . from the above construction , with @xmath18 $ ] defined to map the energy - momentum manifold onto itself , @xmath20 any isotropic dispersion relation can be written in the following form  @xcite , @xmath21    in this paper , we consider the case with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the photon with zero mass becomes @xmath24 when @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) implies a maximum momentum @xmath25 , which is an invariant under deformed transformation laws .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 corresponds to an energy upper bound for photons .",
    "contrary to the modified sr in the framework of effective field theory where the dispersion relation for photons is spin - dependent , the dispersion relation is spin - independent in dsr .",
    "based on the relation ( [ dr ] ) , one obtains @xmath26 the speed of light is therefore energy - dependent , @xmath27 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ speedoflight ] .",
    "we can see explicitly that with energy increasing , the speed of light increases with a positive @xmath1 , and decreases with a negative one . if the theory is to provide a solution to the horizon problem without inflation , @xmath13 is required .",
    "however , we consider both signs in this paper , for the sake of completeness .     and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the dotted horizontal line is the canonical result in the sr.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we have to emphasize that , as stressed by amelino - camelia  @xcite , though many authors working on dsr insist on getting formulas that make sense all the way up to infinite particle energies , it is possible that dsr is relevant only at energy scales that are sub - planckian ( but nearly planckian ) . if we actually expect to give up an intelligible picture of space - time and its symmetries above the planck scale , then perhaps we should be open to the possibility of using mathematics that provides an acceptable ( closed ) logical picture of dsr only at the leading order ( or some finite orders ) in the taylor expansion of formulas in powers of the planck length .",
    "this possibility will not affect the results in most literatures , where only the effects at low energies were anaylzed .",
    "however , in this paper , the integration in the phase space is up to @xmath28 , so we need to assume that the formulas are tenable even up to the planck scale in order to be self - consistent .",
    "there are possibilities of photon decays , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath29 , when the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion relation ] ) alone is considered with proper lv parameters and unmodified energy - momentum conservation laws  @xcite",
    ". however , these possibilities are totally invalid in dsr , since such kind of decays lead to energy thresholds for the decay of a single particle , and those are forbidden for the sake of relativistic principle  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is proper to consider the photon gas composed from free particles forming a thermodynamical ensemble .",
    "consider the photon gas in a container of volume @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the momentum spectrum is continuous in the thermodynamical limit with an infinite @xmath30 and negligible boundary conditions",
    ". then the number of microstates available in the position ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and momentum ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where the factor @xmath36 results from two directions of polarization .",
    "the arguments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite imply that the net effect of a deformed measure of integration in dsr can be described with the replacement , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a function of the energy @xmath39 and needs to be adjusted by future insights on detailed analysis .",
    "( [ deformedintegration ] ) is often left out without proper justifications in previous works  @xcite , and we would consider the deformation of the integration measure for completeness .    for the dispersion relation",
    "we adopt in ( [ dr ] ) , the law of composition of momenta is modified into @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an infinitesimal increment .",
    "because of the virtue of relativistic principle , @xmath42 satisfies the same functional form of eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) . consequently , it is straightforward to get the form of @xmath38 , @xmath43 thus for each spatial component @xmath44 and a function @xmath45 , which is the integrand of @xmath46 , the law of composition of momenta suggests that , @xmath47 this in turn suggests that for one spatial momentum we have @xmath48 which is equal to a replacement of the integration measure , @xmath49 .",
    "in the case we are interested , with three spatial and one time dimensions , we finally get the modified integration measure , @xmath50    it is worthy to mention that the form of the deformed measure of integration ( [ deformed3 ] ) is a little different from that used in refs .",
    "their results can be written in a united form as @xmath51    if we assume that the modified dispersion relations adopted in our work and of earlier papers coincide in the leading - order approximation , we have @xmath52 and consequently , @xmath53    we should emphasize that high - order differences for the integration measure result from different modified dispersion relations and mathematical frameworks . nowadays , these differences do not really matter , because currently we can not conclude which specific model of dsr should describe the real nature . nevertheless , the leading - order corrections , which are of great scientific interests at the present stage , are the same in different models of dsr .",
    "after we carefully consider the integration measure , we now turn to the grand partition function of a photon gas .",
    "the grand partition function @xmath54 of the photon gas in a container with fixed volume @xmath30 is defined as @xmath55 in the following we will always adopt the units in which @xmath56 .    in the scenario where @xmath13 , with relation between @xmath39 and @xmath57 given in eqs .",
    "( [ dr ] ) and ( [ ddr ] ) , the grand partition function is given in the form @xmath58 we adopt a dimensionless variant @xmath59 to simplify ( [ xi ] ) , @xmath60 in the limit @xmath61 , it reduces to the normal sr result , @xmath62    the grand partition function @xmath54 of the photon gas when @xmath14 can be obtained similarly , and the result is @xmath63 the change of the upper limit in the integration results from the existence of a maximum energy @xmath64 .",
    "still , it reduces to the normal sr result in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "we would like to point out that in this case , the integration diverges when @xmath66 approaches to 1 , and this implies that underlying quantum - gravitational theories should replace the dsr model when the temperature is around or larger than the planck temperature .",
    "we observe that most models , in which an invariant energy or momentum scale exists with the speed of light decreasing with respect to energy , suffer from similar problems . in spite of this problem",
    ", we can mainly pay attention to the situation where @xmath66 is lower bounded from 1 , thus the theory is still well defined .    for both @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", we further set @xmath67 respectively , and that is only a matter of units without losing generality .",
    "we write the grand partition function @xmath54 in the following form , @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 for compact discussions below .",
    "thus , all modifications from dsr are encoded in the function @xmath71 .",
    "we show the behavior of @xmath71 in fig .",
    "it is noteworthy to observe that , @xmath72 with @xmath13 while @xmath73 with @xmath14 .",
    "thus the number of available states changes according to @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is positive , the number of available states allowed is reduced , and while @xmath1 is negative , it is enhanced .",
    "this is the main result we get from thermodynamics of dsr . from fig .",
    "[ ft ] , it is illustrated that the deformation of integration measure makes the changes more sharply .",

    "the red solid line and the blue dashed line are the results of the situations in which @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively . the green dash - dotted line and the purple dash - dot - dotted line are corresponding results without taking the deformed integral measure ( d.i.m ) into consideration .",
    "the dotted horizontal line is the canonical result in sr.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "having derived the expression of the partition function of the photon gas , we can study various thermodynamical properties in the following .",
    "both the situations in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 are to be considered and compared , and we call them  positive - type theory \" and  negative - type theory \" respectively .",
    "as will be shown , all the thermodynamical variants depend merely on @xmath71 and its derivatives .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the results presented here are almost the same even when some other forms of dsr models are considered instead of dsr2 .",
    "thus , our results are possible to represent general deformed dispersion relations qualitatively within dsr theories .",

    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ cv ] . compared to the result in sr ,",
    "the specific heat is remarkably smaller in the positive - type theory , and larger in the negative - type theory , when @xmath66 approaches to @xmath87 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in the positive - type theory , the specific heat tends to be a constant when @xmath66 is large .",
    "the smaller @xmath84 and larger @xmath84 than that of sr in the positive - type and negative - type theories respectively reflect the situations in fig .",

    "it is clearly seen that the entropy grows much slower in the positive - type theory and faster in the negative - type theory , and this is consistent with our previous observations .",
    "in fact , the different behaviors of the entropy of the system for two types of theories result directly from different modifications of the total available number of microstates . when @xmath13 , there are fewer available states , hence less chaos , while @xmath14 induces more available states and more chaos .",
    "the entropy measures chaos naturally .",
    "thus the behavior of the entropy is rather understandable .    .",

    "the dotted horizontal line is the canonical result in sr.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]      the expression of @xmath54 can be used to get the pressure @xmath90 of the photon gas @xmath91 which appears merely a function of @xmath81 .",
    "the relation between the pressure @xmath90 and @xmath66 is given in fig .",
    "we can see that the pressure reduces when @xmath13 , with respect to the case in sr , and reverses when @xmath14 .",
    "it is understandable that the fewer number of states ( @xmath13 ) causes the photons to gather with an effective attractive force , while the more number of density induces an effective repulsive force , compared to the case in sr .",
    "such an effective force is important when the dynamical behavior of photons is under consideration .    .",
    "the red solid line and the blue dashed line are the results of the situation in which @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",

    "in contrast with our naive expectations , @xmath93 with a positive @xmath1 is larger than that with a negative one .",

    "in this paper , we derived the grand partition function of a photon gas in doubly special relativity ( dsr ) , based on careful considerations of the deformed dispersion relation and the modified measure of integration , as well as the upper bound of energy / momentum .",
    "then we discussed the thermodynamical quantities of the photon gas and showed that the behaviors of thermodynamical variants are modified according to the deformation parameter @xmath1 .",
    "these modifications are not remarkable when the temperature is low , say @xmath96 , thus it is not easy to detect the effects directly in present laboratory experiments .",
    "however , significant differences exist when the energy approaches to the planck scale .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that these modifications play an important role in cosmology , especially on properties of the early universe .",
    "thus if these modifications turn out to be correct , the behavior of photons in the early stage of the big bang will be very different from what we observe at low energy .",
    "for example , the modification of the ratio of pressure to energy density we have considered in sec .",
    "[ secprho ] leads to a different characteristic of the evolvement of the weight that radiations occupy among all types of energy in the whole universe , and its consequence is of noticeable importance on the evolution of the universe .    in summary , we derived the thermodynamics of the photon gas in the framework of dsr .",
