    "at the beginning of the last century , paul langevin , a prominent french physicist , proposed an alternative description of brownian motion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to earlier einstein s approach @xcite , which deals with the fokker - planck equation for the probability density of an ensemble of independent brownian particles , langevin used the equation of motion for a single brownian particle , the so - called langevin equation .",
    "in fact , applying newton s second law with a random force arising from the surrounding medium , he introduced a first example of stochastic differential equations .",
    "now the langevin approach is one of the most effective and widely used tools for studying the effects of a fluctuating environment @xcite .    in physics , many other stochastic equations that account for the influence of the environment are also often termed  langevin equations \" . among them ,",
    "the dimensionless first - order ( overdamped ) langevin equation @xmath0 is the simplest and at the same time most important .",
    "it describes noise effects in very different systems , but to be specific we will call @xmath1 a particle position [ @xmath2 , @xmath3 a deterministic force field , and @xmath4 a random force ( noise ) resulting from a fluctuating environment .",
    "the langevin approach is particularly useful when the noise @xmath4 can be approximated by the time derivative of the noise generating process @xmath5 , i.e. , random process with stationary and independent increments @xmath6 .",
    "the reason is that in this case the solution of equation ( [ langevin ] ) is a markov process whose future behavior is determined only by the present state , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main statistical characteristic of the particle position @xmath1 , its probability density @xmath7 , depends fundamentally on the probability density @xmath8 of the increments @xmath9 for a sufficiently small time increment @xmath10 . on a phenomenological level",
    ", @xmath11 must be chosen to obtain the best representation of the environmental fluctuations .",
    "if these fluctuations are the result of many independent random variables with zero mean and finite variance , then , according to the central limit theorem @xcite , @xmath8 can be approximated by a gaussian probability density with zero mean and a variance proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath5 becomes a wiener process and @xmath4 reduces to gaussian white noise . as is well known , in this case the process @xmath1 is continuous and @xmath7 satisfies the ordinary fokker - planck equation @xcite@xcite which describes a huge variety of noise phenomena . if the above mentioned random variables have no finite variance then , as the generalized central limit theorem suggests @xcite , @xmath8 can be chosen in the form of a lvy stable probability density .",
    "this choice of @xmath8 corresponds to lvy stable noise @xmath4 and leads to the fractional fokker - planck equation for @xmath7 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) driven by lvy stable noise and the corresponding fractional fokker - planck equation describe the so - called lvy flights , i.e. , random processes exhibiting rare but large jumps @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the ordinary and fractional fokker - planck equations hold also for the probability densities represented in the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a scale function that tends to zero as @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a probability density satisfying the condition @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the dirac delta function .",
    "specifically , the ordinary equation holds for a class of probability densities @xmath15 with finite variance , and the fractional one for a class of heavy - tailed @xmath15 , i.e. , probability densities with power - law tails and infinite second moment .",
    "although these classes cover the most important cases , they do not exhaust all possible probability densities : there also exists a class of super - heavy - tailed probability densities @xmath15 which have never been used in the langevin approach . according to the definition , these densities decay so slowly that all fractional moments @xmath18 with @xmath19 are infinite ( at @xmath20 the normalization of @xmath15 implies @xmath21 ) .",
    "because of this  unphysical \" property , the super - heavy - tailed distributions , as well as the heavy - tailed ones , are not directly related to  physical \" random variables having finite variance .",
    "nevertheless , they are often used to model some specific properties of physical systems .",
    "moreover , the heavy - tailed distributions have become a common tool for studying anomalous physical phenomena , see e.g. @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite .",
    "although the super - heavy - tailed distributions have not yet received much attention , the examples of extremely slow diffusion @xcite demonstrate the usefulness of these distributions for describing systems with highly anomalous behavior .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we wish to extend the langevin equation method to a class of super - heavy - tailed noises , i.e. noises arising from the super - heavy - tailed distributions .",
    "the importance of this problem is that these noises , together with the previously known , exhaust all possible noises associated with the probability density @xmath15 and , as a consequence , enhance the capability of this method .",
    "second , we intend to show that super - heavy - tailed noises generate two probabilistic states of a particle , survived and absorbed .",
    "the existence of these states makes it possible to model the particle dynamics , which is randomly interrupted by the transition of a particle to a qualitatively new state , within the langevin approach .",
    "this transition can occur in a number of physical processes , including the processes of annihilation , evaporation and absorption . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the applicability of the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) driven by super - heavy - tailed noise for describing the particle dynamics , both deterministic and random , in an absorbing medium .",
    "we start our analysis with the generalized fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath22 which corresponds to the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the direct and inverse fourier transforms , respectively , @xmath25 is the characteristic function of the particle position @xmath1 , and @xmath26 is the characteristic function of the noise generating process @xmath5 at @xmath27 .",
    "it is assumed that the solution of equation ( [ fp1 ] ) satisfies the initial , @xmath28 , and normalization , @xmath29 , conditions .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath26 depends on the fourier transform of the transition probability density @xmath8 over the variable @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath31 then @xmath32      \\label{s}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ fp1 ] ) reproduces all known forms of the fokker - planck equation associated with the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) and is valid for all probability densities @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that because the scale function @xmath13 tends to zero as @xmath14 , the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath35 is determined by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath15 at @xmath36 .",
    "next we consider a class of symmetric super - heavy - tailed probability densities @xmath15 whose asymptotic behavior at @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a slowly varying positive function .",
    "the term  slowly varying \" means that the asymptotic relation @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 , holds for all @xmath42 .",
    "since the probability density @xmath15 is normalized , the function @xmath39 must tend to zero more rapidly than @xmath43 . on the other hand , since @xmath44 as @xmath45 for all @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath39 must decay more slowly than any positive power of @xmath47 , yielding @xmath48 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "an illustrative example of the probability density @xmath15 satisfying these conditions is given in equation ( [ p2 ] ) below .    in order to find @xmath49 for the examined class of probability densities , we first rewrite ( [ s ] ) in the form @xmath50 with @xmath51p(y )      \\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\int_{0}^{\\infty}dx\\sin x \\int_{\\lambda x}^{\\infty}dy p(y )      \\label{y1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using either of these representations and the asymptotic formula ( [ as p ] ) , one can easily show that the function @xmath52 , which according to ( [ y1 ] ) tends to zero as @xmath53 , is slowly varying , i.e. @xmath54 if @xmath55 and @xmath14 . finally , taking into account that @xmath56 , we obtain the general form of @xmath34 in the case of super - heavy - tailed @xmath15 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the kronecker delta which equals @xmath59 if @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise , and @xmath62 this limit depends on both the asymptotic behavior of @xmath52 at @xmath63 and the behavior of the scale function @xmath13 at @xmath14 . since the former is controlled by a given function @xmath39 , the nontrivial action of super - heavy - tailed noise , which is characterized by the condition @xmath64 , occurs only at an appropriate choice of @xmath13 .",
    "we note that while @xmath65 for all @xmath15 with finite variance and @xmath66 almost for all heavy - tailed @xmath15 , where @xmath67 is an index of stability associated with the corresponding @xmath15 @xcite , there is no universal dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath10 for different super - heavy - tailed @xmath15 . moreover , because of the function @xmath52 is slowly varying , the scale function @xmath13 is in general not unique even for given @xmath15 and @xmath68 .",
    "we stress , however , that according to ( [ s2 ] ) the influence of super - heavy - tailed noises is fully accounted by the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , this lack of uniqueness is of no importance and both the langevin and fokker - planck equations remain well defined ( see also the next section ) .    to avoid possible problems with the interpretation of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fp1 ] ) at the condition ( [ s2 ] ) , let us temporarily replace the kronecker delta by a less singular function @xmath69 ( @xmath70 if @xmath71 and @xmath72 if @xmath73 ) which reduces to @xmath58 in the limit @xmath74 . in this case , taking @xmath75 , we can write the solution of equation ( [ fp1 ] ) in the form @xmath76 , where the terms @xmath77 and @xmath78 are governed by the equations @xmath79 with the initial conditions @xmath80 and @xmath81 and the normalization condition @xmath82 . assuming that @xmath83 is the solution of the deterministic equation @xmath84 satisfying the initial condition @xmath85 , the solution of equation ( [ fp2 ] ) can be written as @xmath86",
    ".      \\label{sol1}\\ ] ] by integrating @xmath77 over all @xmath87 one finds that this solution is not normalized to unity : @xmath88 . using this result and the relation @xmath89",
    "we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "it should be noted that the function @xmath91 and the normalization condition for @xmath92 , @xmath90 , do not depend on @xmath93 , i.e. they hold also at @xmath94 when @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , it is clear from the equation @xmath96 }      { \\pi[x - z(t)]}e^{-qt }      \\nonumber\\\\      & & \\ !",
    "+ \\frac{q}{\\pi } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } dy      \\frac{\\sin \\kappa(x - y ) } { x - y}\\mathcal{a}(y , t )      \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath97 ) , which follows from ( [ a ] ) , ( [ sol1 ] ) and the relation @xmath98 ,      \\label{rel1}\\ ] ] that the function @xmath92 depends on @xmath93 .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that equation ( [ a1 ] ) provides a correct normalization for @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , the integration of both sides of this equation over all @xmath87 and the use of the formula @xmath99 lead to the equation @xmath100 whose solution satisfying the initial condition @xmath101 reproduces the above result : @xmath102 .",
    "we note , however , that because of replacing @xmath58 by @xmath69 , equation ( [ a1 ] ) with a fixed @xmath93 describes the influence of super - heavy - tailed noises in an approximate way . moreover , this approximation is valid if @xmath103 is much less than the characteristic length scale @xmath104 ( in the opposite case the behavior of @xmath78 may be unphysical with @xmath105 for some @xmath87 and @xmath106 ) .    assuming that @xmath107 and @xmath93 is so small that @xmath108 , we can reduce equation ( [ a1 ] ) to the form @xmath109 as is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) , its general solution is given by the sum of a particular solution of this equation , which is proportional to @xmath93 , and the general solution of the related homogeneous equation ( when @xmath110 ) .",
    "since @xmath97 , the latter is also proved to be proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath78 at @xmath111 tends to zero linearly with @xmath93 . in particular ,",
    "if the external force depends only on time , i.e. @xmath112 , then @xmath113 and the general solution of equation ( [ a2 ] ) is given by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is an arbitrary function",
    ". this function can be determined from the initial condition @xmath97 , @xmath116 , yielding @xmath117 as @xmath94 .",
    "the above results show that under the action of super - heavy - tailed noise two probabilistic states of a particle appear .",
    "the first one is described by the probability density @xmath77 and is realized with probability @xmath118 .",
    "since the noise does not affect the particle trajectory @xmath83 , see ( [ sol1 ] ) , we refer to this state as the surviving state .",
    "the second state , which is associated with the probability density @xmath119 ( we recall that @xmath120 as @xmath94 ) , is realized with probability @xmath121 .",
    "the transition to this state implies that a particle jumps to infinity and it is excluded from future consideration .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to call this state absorbing . to avoid any confusion , we emphasize that the act of absorption is considered here as the transition of a particle into the state in which the probability to find this particle in any finite interval equals zero .",
    "thus , super - heavy - tailed noise plays the role of an absorbing medium characterized by the rate of absorption @xmath68 .",
    "accordingly , the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) driven by this noise describes the overdamped motion of a particle in an absorbing medium .",
    "as equation ( [ sol1 ] ) shows , before absorption , which is random in time , the motion is deterministic and occurs under a force field @xmath3 .",
    "the random motion of a particle in an absorbing medium can also be described within the langevin approach . to this end",
    ", we represent @xmath4 in the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) as a sum of two independent noises : ( i ) super - heavy - tailed noise @xmath122 , which models an absorbing medium , and ( ii ) noise @xmath123 , which induces the random motion of a particle .",
    "calculations similar to those described above lead to the result @xmath124 , where @xmath125 denotes the normalized to unity probability density associated with the random motion of a particle .",
    "in particular , if @xmath123 is gaussian white noise then @xmath125 is the solution of the ordinary fokker - planck equation , and if @xmath123 is lvy stable noise then @xmath125 is the solution of the fractional fokker - planck equation . in these cases ,",
    "the langevin equation describes brownian motion and lvy flights , respectively , in an absorbing medium .",
    "in order to verify numerically that super - heavy - tailed noise acts as an absorbing medium , we first specify the super - heavy - tailed probability density @xmath15 by choosing @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the density parameter . this symmetric probability density is unimodal with the peak located at @xmath128 and has no characteristic scale .",
    "the behavior of @xmath15 at @xmath129 is characterized by the conditions @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and at @xmath132 by the asymptotic formula @xmath133 [ this implies that @xmath134 . for this probability density the slowly varying function ( [ y1 ] ) , after calculating the inner integral , takes the form @xmath135 to find the leading term of @xmath52 at @xmath53 , which determines the rate of absorption ( [ q1 ] ) , we use the identity @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "substitution of this identity into ( [ y3 ] ) yields @xmath138 then , taking into account that @xmath139 $ ] , where @xmath140 is the gamma function , @xmath141 and @xmath142 we arrive to the desired asymptotic formula @xmath143 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "as it follows from the definition of the rate of absorbtion ( [ q1 ] ) , in the considered case it can be represented in the form @xmath144 with @xmath145 depending on the behavior of the scale function @xmath13 at @xmath14 , the parameter @xmath146 can take the values from @xmath61 to @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath13 approaches zero so fast that @xmath148 then super - heavy - tailed noise does not affect the particle dynamics at all , i.e. the particle absorption is absent ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath13 tends to zero in such a way that @xmath150 then the noise action is so strong that the transition to the absorbing state happens at @xmath151 , i.e. a particle is absorbed immediately ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "a non - trivial action of super - heavy - tailed noise occurs at @xmath153 . according to ( [ r ] ) , in this case @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is a positive function satisfying the condition @xmath156^{\\tau } \\to 1 $ ] as @xmath157 .",
    "an explicit form of this function is of no importance ( and so we can choose @xmath158 ) because at @xmath154 and @xmath159^{\\tau } = 1 $ ] the rate of absorption @xmath68 does not depend on @xmath155 : @xmath160^{\\tau } } =      \\frac{\\ln s}{r - \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0 } \\ln [ b(\\tau)]^{\\tau}}=      \\frac{\\ln s}{r}.      \\label{q2}\\ ] ] thus , assuming for simplicity that @xmath161 , we obtain for the examined case the probability density of the particle position in the surviving ( non - absorbing ) state , @xmath162 and the probability of absorption , @xmath163 .",
    "it is worthy to note that while the probability density ( [ p2 ] ) with super - heavy tails depends on the single parameter @xmath164 , the corresponding super - heavy - tailed noise is characterized also by the additional parameter @xmath146 .",
    "the parameter @xmath146 relates to the scale function @xmath13 and at a fixed @xmath164 it controls the noise intensity , namely , the smaller the parameter @xmath146 is the larger is this intensity .",
    "the dependence of the scale function on the parameter which characterizes the noise intensity is not surprising and occurs for all probability densities @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "if the parameters @xmath164 and @xmath146 are chosen then super - heavy - tailed noise associated with the probability density ( [ p2 ] ) is completely determined and both the langevin and fokker - planck equations are well defined .",
    "we have verified the analytical results obtained in the previous section by numerically studying the statistics of the particle positions . because of the langevin equation has never before been simulated in the case of super - heavy - tailed noises , we briefly describe the procedure for finding the particle position @xmath165 at @xmath166 .",
    "the first step is calculating the quantity @xmath167 with @xmath158 and @xmath168 being a random number uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "since the positive quantities @xmath170 are distributed with the probability density @xmath171 \\ln^{2 } [ s + \\rho /a(\\tau ) ] \\}^{-1}$ ] , the increments @xmath172 , whose probability density @xmath173 is determined by ( [ p2 ] ) , can be represented in the form @xmath174 , where @xmath175 or @xmath176 with probability @xmath177 each . finally ,",
    "calculating @xmath178 @xmath179 times , we obtain the simulated value of the particle position : @xmath180 .",
    "the sample paths of @xmath181 are the piecewise constant random functions of time which are defined on the intervals @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) and satisfy the condition @xmath184 ( see figure  1(a ) ) .",
    "the behavior of these sample paths at @xmath14 is determined by two major factors .",
    "the first consists in the absence of finite fractional moments of @xmath170 .",
    "this means that the increments @xmath185 have no characteristic scale and arbitrary large values of @xmath185 are in principle possible .",
    "the second is that the scale function @xmath13 tends to zero very rapidly as @xmath10 decreases .",
    "since @xmath186 , this implies that for small enough @xmath10 the difference between the increments in neighboring intervals is in general negligible .",
    "therefore , one may expect ( and this is confirmed by our simulations ) that in the limit @xmath14 the competition of these factors leads to the condition @xmath187 with @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is a random time in which the absolute value of the increment becomes bigger than any preassigned positive number ( see figure  1(b ) ) .",
    "we interpret the discontinuous jump of @xmath1 which occurs at @xmath190 as the transition of a particle to the absorbing state .",
    "illustrative examples of the sample paths of the particle position @xmath1 for a finite time increment @xmath10 ( a ) and in the limit @xmath14 ( b ) .",
    "the vertical arrow in figure  1(a ) means that the jump of @xmath1 at @xmath191 exceeds the figure frame .",
    "in contrast , the arrows in figure  1(b ) indicate that at @xmath192 an infinite jump of @xmath1 occurs in the positive or negative direction of the axis @xmath87 . the horizontal line with @xmath193 and",
    "@xmath188 corresponds to the surviving state , and the vertical line to the absorbing state . ]",
    "illustrative histograms of the probability distribution of particle positions are shown in figure  2 for two different values of the time increment @xmath10 .",
    "histograms of the probability distribution of particle positions obtained by numerical simulations of the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are @xmath27 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 ( a ) and @xmath200 ( b ) . ]",
    "the height of the @xmath201th bin ( @xmath202 ) represents the probability @xmath203 to find a particle in this bin at time @xmath166 .",
    "the probability @xmath203 is determined as the ratio @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the overall number of numerical experiments , i.e. calculations of @xmath1 , and @xmath206 is the number of those experiments in which @xmath1 falls into this bin , i.e. when @xmath207 with @xmath208 being the bin width .",
    "in contrast , the heights of the leftmost and rightmost bins represent the probabilities @xmath209 and @xmath210 that @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively . according to these definitions @xmath213 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath203 ( @xmath214 ) rapidly tend to zero as @xmath10 decreases , and for small enough @xmath10 the histogram takes the form with only three visible bins ( e.g. , in figure  2(b ) @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 ) .",
    "hence , the less is @xmath10 the better the condition @xmath218 holds .",
    "the probability @xmath219 approaches the survival probability @xmath220 ( see figure  3 ) ,     time dependence of the survival probability .",
    "the solid line represents the theoretical dependence @xmath220 ( for @xmath194 , @xmath195 ) , and the circular symbols indicate the results of the numerical simulation .",
    "the latter are obtained by calculating the height of the central bin in figure  1(b ) for different values of the dimensionless time @xmath106 . ]    and its independence on @xmath208 ( if @xmath208 is not too small for a fixed @xmath10 ) yields @xmath221 , i.e. the theoretical result ( [ pdf ] ) indeed holds . finally , the facts that @xmath203 ( @xmath214 ) approach zero as @xmath10 decreases and @xmath222 ( if @xmath223 is not too large for a fixed @xmath10 ) capture the main properties of @xmath78 , namely , @xmath224 as @xmath94 and @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the simulation results are in full agreement with our theoretical predictions .",
    "in summary , we have incorporated a class of super - heavy - tailed noises into the langevin equation formalism .",
    "these noises arise from the super - heavy - tailed probability densities whose all fractional moments are infinite . due to this feature ,",
    "super - heavy - tailed noises induce two probabilistic states of a particle , survived and absorbed ones .",
    "thus the langevin equation driven by these noises becomes a useful tool for studying a number of physical phenomena such as absorption , evaporation , annihilation , etc .",
    "we have solved analytically the corresponding generalized fokker - planck equation and have confirmed our theoretical predictions via the numerical simulation of this langevin equation .",
