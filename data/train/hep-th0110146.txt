    "gauge theories in greater than four dimensions are of interest to phenomenologists and string theorists . recently a new way of realizing higher dimensional theories",
    "was introduced  @xcite ( for related work see  @xcite ) .",
    "these models are four - dimensional gauge theories defined on a `` theory space''``moose ''  @xcite or `` quiver ''  @xcite diagrams constructed of sites and links  representing the gauge theory degrees of freedom . although the dynamics of these models is four - dimensional at high energies , they appear higher - dimensional below some energy scale .",
    "this energy scale is set by the expectation values of the link fields , which higgs the gauge groups to the diagonal subgroup , allowing the fields to `` hop '' in the extra dimensions . in this low energy regime",
    "the theory space becomes a picture of the extra dimensions , and the effective action becomes that of a higher - dimensional gauge theory with latticized extra dimensions . in reference  @xcite both non - supersymmetric and @xmath3 supersymmetric models which develop one circular extra dimension were described .",
    "the massive gauge multiplets from the higgs mechanism in the four - dimensional theory are the massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the compactified five - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the supersymmetric case is particularly interesting  @xcite .",
    "the theory space for this example is a circle with @xmath0 @xmath4 gauge groups , all with gauge coupling @xmath5 , connected by chiral superfields transforming as bi - fundamentals under the gauge groups at adjacent sites .",
    "the extra dimension is formed along the higgs branch of the theory , where all chiral multiplets have the same expectation value @xmath6 .",
    "the parameters of the resulting effective latticized five - dimensional gauge theory are perturbatively related to those of the four - dimensional theory as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the effective lattice spacing in the 5th dimension . at distances large compared to @xmath8 the resulting five - dimensional gauge theory is both approximately five - dimensionally lorentz invariant and @xmath3 supersymmetric , with corrections proportional to positive powers of the lattice spacing @xmath8 . both of these symmetries are _ larger _ than the original lorentz invariance and supersymmetry in the four - dimensional model ; in particular the supersymmetry has effectively doubled from 4 to 8 supercharges at low energies .",
    "this theory provides a uv completion of a five - dimensional gauge theory by reverting to four - dimensional behavior at distances shorter than @xmath8 .",
    "it is tempting to try to take @xmath9 , while holding @xmath10 and @xmath11 fixed  in this limit the theory would be an interacting five - dimensional , lorentz invariant @xmath3 supersymmetric theory at _ all _ distances , providing a purely four - dimensional definition of a truly five - dimensional theory .",
    "however note that from this limit implies that @xmath5 , the four - dimensional yang - mills coupling , must be taken to infinity .",
    "but once @xmath5 gets of order @xmath12 the four - dimensional gauge theories are better described in the confining phase rather than the higgs phase .",
    "the resulting dynamics no longer describes a five - dimensional theory .",
    "this limits the effective lattice spacing @xmath13 and prevents completion to a purely higher - dimensional theory .",
    "this analysis suggests a higher - dimensional completion might be possible in a four - dimensional theory which remains in the higgs phase even at strong coupling .",
    "if instead of the asymptotically free four - dimensional gauge theories of the previous example we had started with superconformal theories , we might hope to take the limit @xmath14 without encountering a phase transition .",
    "this is the starting point for our present analysis : the identification of superconformal theory spaces which , in the higgs phase , deconstruct extra dimensions .",
    "we will find that the @xmath15 version of the previous example is such a superconformal theory .",
    "although the massive gauge boson spectrum suggest a five - dimensional gauge theory , surprisingly we will find a non - perturbative set of monopoles and dyons which fill out the spectrum for a _ six _ dimensional theory .",
    "similarly we will consider a superconformal theory space which is the triangulation of a torus .",
    "the massive gauge boson spectrum reproduces the kk modes of a six dimensional theory directly ; remarkably the non - perturbative spectrum exhibits winding modes !    in the continuum limit described above these theories become well - defined interacting six dimensional lorentz invariant theories with 16 supercharges .",
    "only two such theories are thought to exist : the @xmath1 superconformal theory and little string theory .",
    "the @xmath16 superconformal field theory ( scft ) , defined as a @xmath17-dimensional conformal theory with a chiral @xmath1 supersymmetry in six dimensions  @xcite , can be understood as a low energy description of @xmath18 coincident m5-branes in m - theory or a decoupled description of the @xmath19 singularity in type iib string theory .",
    "the @xmath1 superconformal field theory is useful in defining the matrix model  @xcite for m - theory on @xmath20 .",
    "seiberg realized that the matrix model for m - theory on @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be formulated in terms of a new six - dimensional `` non - local '' quantum theory called little string theory ( lst )  @xcite .",
    "lst with a @xmath2 susy can be found as a decoupled @xmath23 description of @xmath18 coincident ns5-branes of type iib string theory with @xmath24 kept fixed while the t - dual @xmath1 lst is found on ns5-branes in type iia string theory .",
    "matrix model descriptions of these theories have also been constructed  @xcite .",
    "while many insights have been gained about the nature of these six - dimensional theories , they remain mysterious and exhibit surprising properties .",
    "for instance , the holographic ads / cft dual  @xcite of the @xmath16 scft for @xmath18 large describes m - theory in the @xmath25 geometry while the dual description of little string theories involves a linear dilaton background  @xcite .",
    "an interesting topological term in the low - energy derivative expansion of the equations of motion of the @xmath1 theory  @xcite underlies the description of the `` tensionless strings ''  @xcite that gain a nonzero tension on the coulomb branch .",
    "while the @xmath1 scft exhibits phenomena connected with tensionless strings , the little strings have tension equal to the tension of `` big strings '' , a hagedorn density of states , and can be thought of as toy models for some general features of string theory while avoiding the complications of quantum gravity .",
    "it is natural to suspect that our theories are a four - dimensional lagrangian description of @xmath1 and little string theory .",
    "we will argue this result by realizing our four - dimensional field theories as the @xmath26 limits of d3-branes on orbifolds . using conventional s- and t - dualities",
    "we will show that our continuum limit precisely reproduces the definitions of @xmath1 scft and @xmath2 little string theory .",
    "our theories at finite effective lattice spacing offer a discretization of @xmath1 and little string theory",
    ".    we will begin by describing our two superconformal theories that perturbatively deconstruct extra dimensions . to motivate our string construction",
    "we will describe the expected spectra of elementary and solitonic excitations .",
    "these states will have a standard interpretation in our orbifold constructions .",
    "following the methods of  @xcite we construct a conformal four - dimensional @xmath15 gauge theory whose theory space  that is the space of the moose / quiver diagram  is a circle with @xmath0 sites , as shown in figure [ fig-1s ] .",
    "each site represents an @xmath4 gauge group with gauge coupling @xmath5 , while each link represents a hypermultiplet transforming as a bi - fundamental under the gauge groups at the link ends .",
    "it is a superconformal field theory , and is expected to have an @xmath27 duality  @xcite .",
    "this theory has a moduli space of vacua , including the direction where each hypermultiplet has an expectation value @xmath6 . as in  @xcite a fifth dimension",
    "is generated at low energies , where the action takes the form of a five - dimensional @xmath15 gauge theory with a latticized fifth dimension .",
    "perturbatively the effective lattice spacing is @xmath28 , the radius of the new dimension is @xmath29 and the five - dimensional gauge coupling is @xmath30 .",
    "the spectrum of massive gauge bosons is @xmath31 precisely that of a latticized kk tower .",
    "these states are not bps .",
    "there are no bps states on the higgs branch of @xmath32 theories .",
    "so these masses could receive quantum corrections at strong coupling .",
    "however they are `` almost bps '' .",
    "that is they become bps states in the low energy @xmath33 theory .",
    "since our states have masses that put them in @xmath33 up to @xmath34 deviations all quantum corrections to the masses must go to zero as @xmath34 .",
    "far from the top of the tower , @xmath35 , the mass spectrum is nearly linear @xmath36 , reflecting the nearly continuum physics at distances large compared to the lattice spacing @xmath8 . since @xmath15 supersymmetry in 5 dimensions has 16 supercharges , while our four - dimensional field theory only has 8 supercharges , we have doubled the supersymmetry at distances large compared to the lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "this is not surprising : the effective action for a latticized fifth dimension necessarily breaks these extra supersymmetries , but this breaking vanishes at distances where the five - dimensional continuum description applies . at the very lowest energies beneath the lightest massive kk mode , @xmath37",
    ", the theory reduces to a four - dimensional @xmath38 @xmath4 gauge theory with gauge coupling @xmath39 . as usual",
    "the compactification of a five - dimensional @xmath15 gauge theory on a circle leads to a four - dimensional @xmath38 gauge theory beneath the compactification scale .",
    "in addition to the almost bps spectrum of massive gauge bosons , this theory has a spectrum of `` dyonic '' excitations .",
    "we can infer the full spectrum by exploiting the @xmath27 s - duality of the @xmath15 conformal field theory .",
    "the strong - weak duality is generated by @xmath40 ( which interchanges @xmath41 in the very low energy @xmath38 theory ) .",
    "therefore there are magnetic states with masses @xmath42 remarkably this is the kk spectrum for yet another dimension of radius @xmath43 .",
    "the s - duality can be rephrased directly as the transformation @xmath44 ; in this form the existence of the 6th dimension is clear beyond the spectrum .",
    "the kk modes with momenta in both the fifth and sixth directions are dyons .    for distances large compared to @xmath8",
    "our quiver theory behaves like a 6 dimensional theory with 16 supercharges . aside from the lattice spacing ,",
    "the only breaking of conformal invariance is the compactification . extrapolating these perturbative results to @xmath45 while keeping @xmath46 fixed shrinks the lattice spacing @xmath47 , yielding an interacting conformal theory with the same bps spectrum as @xmath16 scft compactified on a torus . in the next section",
    "we will show that this limit of our quiver theory _ is _ this @xmath16 scft . for finite",
    "@xmath48 our four - dimensional quiver field theory provides a discretization of @xmath1 theory .",
    "the fluctuation of each link vev is a modulus that corresponds to a fluctuation of the effective lattice spacing ; we expect these moduli to decouple in our limit where the lattice spacing is taken to zero @xcite .",
    "( these moduli are not apparent in the classical d - brane probe picture presented in the next section because there , the gauge group on the sites is @xmath49 rather than @xmath4 , and the additional moduli are lifted by the @xmath50 d - terms ) .",
    "quiver gauge theory.,width=192 ]    another four - dimensional superconformal theory space is shown in figure  [ fig : ntwoquiver ] .",
    "this is an @xmath3 gauge theory with @xmath51 @xmath4 gauge groups at the sites  @xcite .",
    "the links are chiral superfields transforming as bi - fundamentals under the gauge groups at their ends .",
    "in addition we include a cubic superpotential for each triangle : @xmath52 where the plus sign is for clockwise oriented triangles and the minus sign for anti - clockwise orientation .",
    "this theory has a line of superconformal fixed points in the @xmath53 plane  @xcite .",
    "perturbatively this begins as the straight line @xmath54 .",
    "this theory has a large moduli space of vacua , including the direction where each @xmath55 and @xmath56 have expectation values @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , while @xmath59 vanishes . in this case",
    "two extra dimensions are generated at low energies , where the action takes the form of a six - dimensional @xmath60 gauge theory on a rectangular torus with two latticized dimensions .",
    "the effective lattice spacing is again @xmath61 , the radii of the new dimensions are @xmath62 and the six - dimensional gauge coupling is @xmath63 .",
    "we can make a non - rectangular torus by choosing different directions in moduli space where all three of @xmath64 acquire expectation values . the potential",
    "following from the superpotential includes `` plaquette '' operators which produce the @xmath65 pieces of the six - dimensional gauge action .",
    "the spectrum of massive gauge bosons is that of a latticized toroidal kk tower with mass scales @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath60 supersymmetry in 6 dimensions has 16 supercharges , while our four - dimensional field theory only has 4 supercharges , we have quadrupled the supersymmetry at distances large compared to @xmath8 . at the very lowest energies beneath the lightest kk mode",
    ", the theory reduces to a four - dimensional @xmath38 @xmath4 gauge theory with gauge coupling @xmath67 .",
    "in addition to the spectrum of massive gauge bosons , this theory has a spectrum of dyonic excitations .",
    "we can again infer the spectrum by exploiting s - duality . making the transformation @xmath68 , along with the geometric symmetry",
    "@xmath69 , this takes @xmath70 .",
    "this is a t - duality , and the dyonic spectrum includes `` winding '' modes !    for distances large compared to @xmath71 our quiver theory behaves like a 6 dimensional theory with 16 supercharges .",
    "in addition to the lattice spacing , and the compactification , this theory breaks conformal invariance through @xmath72 . taking @xmath73 while keeping @xmath46 and @xmath72 fixed shrinks the lattice spacings @xmath74 , yielding an interacting theory with winding modes compactified on a torus , just like the @xmath2 little string theory . in the next section",
    "we will show that this limit of our quiver theory _ is _",
    "@xmath2 little string theory , with little string tension @xmath75 .",
    "again for finite @xmath76 our four - dimensional quiver field theory provides a discretization of @xmath2 little string theory .",
    "because the `` latticized '' gauge theories in @xmath77 will be related to orbifolds in string theory , it is useful to review how the quiver gauge theories appear .",
    "our presentation will be compressed : a complete account can be found in the original paper by douglas and moore  @xcite .",
    "the relevant orbifolds are @xmath78 for the case of the @xmath1 superconformal field theory and @xmath79 for the case of the @xmath2 little string theory .",
    "the former orbifold can be obtained from the latter by setting @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the generators of @xmath82 act on three complex coordinates of @xmath83 as follows : @xmath84    the orbifold transformation as an action on complex coordinates is embedded in a @xmath85 subgroup of the possible @xmath86 holonomy .",
    "since the phases add to zero , it is actually @xmath87 .",
    "the orbifold is a singular non - compact calabi - yau three - fold , preserving one quarter of the original supersymmetry . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the orbifold action is in @xmath89 and the resulting @xmath90 singularity is a non - compact k3 manifold preserving one half of the original supersymmetry .",
    "what is the world - volume theory of d - branes probing such an orbifold ?",
    "the gauge group and matter representations describing @xmath18 d - branes will be depicted in the quiver diagram : every node of the quiver diagram denotes a gauge group and the arrows connecting the nodes denote the @xmath91 bifundamental representation of those groups @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in our case all @xmath94 and , because the overall @xmath50 decouples , we will discuss @xmath4 groups only .",
    "d - branes that can escape from the singularity at the origin must be accompanied by their @xmath95 mirror images on the covering space ( where we count also the original d - branes ) ; this number equals the order of the discrete group . if we want to describe @xmath18 d - branes , it is therefore useful to start with a @xmath96 group and project onto states invariant under the orbifold action .",
    "the orbifold acts on the @xmath96 chan - paton labels in addition to the obvious action of ( [ table ] ) on the 6 scalars @xmath97 and their fermionic partners . for this action on the group indices",
    ", we have to represent every element of @xmath98 by an element of the gauge group @xmath96 . in our case of an abelian orbifold",
    ", the elements of the group are represented by block diagonal matrices in the @xmath99 subgroup .",
    "the vector multiplets have to be invariant under this action and therefore precisely the ones belonging to this @xmath99 group survive .",
    "labeling those @xmath100 @xmath49s by @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 the nodes form a lattice as in figure  [ fig : ntwoquiver ] .    for the scalars the geometric action has to be compensated by a non - trivial action on the chan - paton factors .",
    "the scalars therefore live in bifundamental representations . consider _",
    "e.g. _ the matrix @xmath104 that carries the information about the positions of the d - branes in @xmath105 .",
    "the physical action of the generator of @xmath106 adds a phase @xmath107 .",
    "it must be cancelled by an action on the quiver nodes .",
    "the correct action is the shift of the nodes by one in the horizontal direction .",
    "therefore the field @xmath104 transforms in the direct sum of a fundamental representation and the anti - fundamental representation of the group which is to the right of the first one , one of the @xmath55 fields in figure  [ fig : ntwoquiver ] .",
    "similarly @xmath108 carries the links @xmath56 in the vertical direction and @xmath109 the diagonal fields @xmath59 .",
    "the fermions follow by supersymmetry and complete @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath59 into chiral multiplets .",
    "our superconformal field theories are obtained as the @xmath26 limit of these orbifolds .",
    "we can match the parameters of the orbifold to the field theory by comparing physical states .",
    "the kk modes of the field theory correspond to fundamental strings stretching between the d - branes and their mirror images as in figure  [ fig : kk ] .",
    "the masses of these modes are the string tension times the length of the string , reproducing the field theory kk spectrum .",
    "the lightest kk mode , with mass @xmath110 , corresponds to the fundamental string stretching between nearest neighbor d3-brane mirrors .",
    "the top of the kk tower , with mass @xmath111 , corresponds to the string which stretches close to the fixed point .",
    "similarly the magnetic and dyonic field theory modes correspond to the d- ( more generally @xmath112 ) strings stretching between the d3-brane mirrors .",
    "we wish to show that the four - dimensional @xmath15 circular theory of the previous section on the higgs branch , in the limit @xmath113 holding the mass of the lightest kk mode @xmath114 and its dual @xmath115 fixed is @xmath16 theory compactified on a torus with radii @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we have realized this four - dimensional field theory as the @xmath118 limit of @xmath18 d3-branes on a @xmath119 orbifold .",
    "this string theory has four parameters : @xmath120 and the distance @xmath121 of the d3-branes from the orbifold fixed point .",
    "the field theory parameters are related to these by @xmath122 therefore we consider this orbifold theory in the limit @xmath123 holding @xmath124 and @xmath125 fixed .",
    "the length of the stretched strings which correspond to the kk modes in the field theory must be `` sub - stringy '' : @xmath126 .",
    "the orbifold then reduces to the field theory at energies @xmath127 .",
    "probing the physics at energy @xmath128 involves fluctuations on the orbifold over distances of size @xmath129 .",
    "this implies @xmath130 .",
    "thus in the large @xmath0 limit the d3-branes only fluctuate over distances small compared to @xmath121 .",
    "consequently we may approximate the @xmath119 orbifold as @xmath131 where the radius of the circle is @xmath132 plus corrections which vanish as @xmath113 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cone ] represents the `` straightening '' of the space near the d3-branes .",
    "more formally , choosing coordinates on @xmath83 as @xmath133 , the orbifold metric is flat with the periodic identifications @xmath134 .",
    "expanding @xmath135 the metric becomes @xmath136 up to corrections of order @xmath137 which vanish in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in this picture the enhancement to 16 supercharges is manifest ",
    "supersymmetry breaking is associated with the orbifold fixed point which can not probed in our limit .    in the small",
    "@xmath138 limit the radius @xmath139 is sub - stringy  a better description is obtained by taking the t - dual to turn this into a large circle with radius @xmath140 , where the orbifold fixed point can still be probed , this t - duality involves ns5-branes corresponding to the orbifold fixed point  @xcite ] . the d3-branes become d4-branes wrapped around this large circle , while the string coupling becomes @xmath141 . as @xmath138 shrinks to zero , the string coupling becomes large ",

    "the orbifold matches to our toroidal quiver field theory with the boundary condition @xmath54 at the scale @xmath145 . as we take the limit @xmath26 the field theory flows to the superconformal fixed line .",

    "four_-dimensional supersymmetric field theories described by theory spaces become @xmath1 scft and little string theory in _ six _ dimensions",
    ".    it would be interesting to understand many aspects of our correspondence in more detail .",
    "for instance , the little string theory is known to have a hagedorn transition  @xcite  how is this reflected in the field theory ? in our four - dimensional theory at the origin of moduli space ,",
    "the conformal invariance is enough to ensure that the free - energy scales as @xmath186 .",
    "even out on the higgs branch where the extra dimensions are formed , this should be the behavior of the free - energy at temperatures above the higgsing scale , that sets the little string tension . since the free - energy diverges as @xmath187",
    ", we might expect a limiting temperature set by the string tension .",
    "however a direct verification of an exponential growth of the number of states with mass set by the little string scale would be far more convincing .",
    "although the little strings wrapped around the extra dimensions are likely four - dimensional instantons `` lifted '' into the theory space , it would be nice to construct the little strings explicitly as field theory solitons .",
    "doing so is important for elucidating issues such as the tension between locality and t - duality  @xcite",
    ". it would also be interesting to understand the relation of our constructions with matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "our construction is based on orbifold realizations of our four - dimensional field theories . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    "these orbifold geometries are only probed in a way that is insensitive to the orbifold fixed points , so that the relevant geometry is well - approximated by compact circles cross flat space .",
    "string dualities can then be used to relate these field theories to known sectors of string theory .",
    "there are likely deconstructions of other non - gravitational theories in five and six dimensions , such as theories with less supersymmetry , :  @xcite and ncos  @xcite theory , _ etc_. especially interesting would be the complete deconstruction of a gravitational theory .",
    "we have indicated a first step in the deconstruction of m - theory , starting with a non - gravitational little string theory in six dimensions .",
