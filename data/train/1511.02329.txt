    "to motivate the content of this note , let @xmath5 be a @xmath6-finite measure space and @xmath7 a positive @xmath8-semigroup on @xmath9 for some @xmath10 . if @xmath11 is a measurable set , if @xmath1 is the projection on @xmath2 which is given by multiplication with the indicator function @xmath12 and if @xmath13 , then for all @xmath14 the limits @xmath15 exist with respect to the strong operator topology and coincide ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  4.1 and theorem  5.3 ) .",
    "the limit can be shown to be a certain degenerate operator semigroup @xcite which we might refer to as a sort of _ absorption semigroup_. usually , the latter term is used to describe the semigroup governed by an abstract cauchy problem which models a diffusion process with a potential (= absorption term ) . for the connection of such absorption semigroups to the limit semigroup in  ( [ form : absorption - for - positive - semigroups ] ) we refer the reader to @xcite ; see also @xcite for some additional background information .    when considering the above convergence result",
    ", a number of potential generalisations immediately comes into ones mind ; for example , one could try to replace the projection @xmath1 , which is given by multiplication with an indicator function , by a more general projection .",
    "one could also try to consider more general spaces and/or to omit the positivity assumption .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for a number of positive and negative results in this direction .",
    "it is also worthwhile pointing out that the second limit in  ( [ form : absorption - for - positive - semigroups ] ) is closely related to the so - called _ quantum zeno effect _ ; we refer to @xcite and the references therein for more details .",
    "in this note we are concerned with the existence of the limits in  ( [ form : absorption - for - positive - semigroups ] ) in the case where @xmath0 is a _ bounded _ linear operator ( without any additional properties ) on an arbitrary banach space and where @xmath1 is an arbitrary bounded linear projection . for this case , the second limit in  ( [ form : absorption - for - positive - semigroups ] )",
    "was shown by matolcsi and shvidkoy to always exist with respect to the strong operator topology ; moreover they identified the limit semigroup and thus proved the following theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) :    [ thm : matolcsi - shvidkoy ] let @xmath0 be a bounded linear operator and @xmath16 a bounded linear projection on a banach space @xmath2 . for each @xmath17 and each @xmath18 we have @xmath19 where the convergence is uniform with respect to @xmath20 on bounded subsets of @xmath21 .",
    "as the generator @xmath0 is bounded it is natural to ask whether the limit exists even in the operator norm topology . in section  [ section : lifting - to - operator - norm - convergence ] at the end of this note we will prove that this is indeed true . our focus , however , is on another question , namely whether the limit @xmath22 always exists if @xmath0 is bounded .",
    "our main result gives an affirmative answer to this question :    [ thm : main - theorem ] let @xmath0 be a bounded linear operator and @xmath1 a bounded linear projection on a complex banach space @xmath2 . define @xmath23 and let @xmath24 .",
    "for all @xmath14 we have @xmath25 with respect to the operator norm , and the convergence is uniform with respect to @xmath20 on compact subsets of @xmath26 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] , which we present in section  [ section : proof - of - main - result ] , uses only elementary methods , but it requires a careful analysis of the spectral properties of @xmath27 .",
    "in fact we will obtain a bit more information about the convergence in the above theorem , including an explicit estimate ( for undefined notation we refer to the end of the introduction ) :    [ rem : uniform - convergence - and - decay - rate ] for @xmath20 in any fixed compact subset of @xmath26 , the convergence in theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] has at least a linear rate .",
    "more precisely , the following holds : let @xmath28 and define @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is any number sufficiently large to ensure that @xmath31 is strictly larger than the spectral radius of @xmath32 .",
    "then for every @xmath24 with @xmath33 and all @xmath34 $ ] we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; here , @xmath38 denotes the resolvent of @xmath32 at @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 can be further estimated by means of the neumann series if we chose @xmath30 sufficiently large such that even @xmath41 .",
    "a few further remarks are in order .",
    "\\(a ) using complexifications one immediately obtains an analogues result for real banach spaces .",
    "\\(b ) the operator family @xmath42 is a ( norm continuous ) @xmath8-semigroup on @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the semigroup @xmath44 converges to @xmath45 on the range of @xmath1 and to a semigroup with generator @xmath32 on the kernel of @xmath1 .",
    "\\(c ) using the power series expansion of the exponential function one obtains several ways to write down the limit semigroup ; in fact , one has @xmath46 for every @xmath47 .",
    "\\(d ) the assertion of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] is obviously false for @xmath48 ; just consider @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 to see this .",
    "\\(e ) a glance at the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] in the next section reveals that one can show similar results for analytic functions @xmath52 other than @xmath53 , provided that @xmath52 satisfies certain decay properties .",
    "since our focus is on operator semigroups , we shall not discuss this in detail .",
    "it seems to be unclear what happens to the assertion of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] if we consider @xmath8-semigroups with _ unbounded _ generator @xmath0 .",
    "of course one expects that some additional conditions are necessary in this case , since otherwise it might happen that @xmath32 has only a very small domain which need not be dense in the range of @xmath16 ; moreover , @xmath32 might not even be closed .",
    "concerning the related theorem  [ thm : matolcsi - shvidkoy ] , we also point out that the strong limit @xmath54 _ never _ exists for all bounded linear projections @xmath16 on @xmath2 unless @xmath0 is bounded ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.1 ) . in any case , the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem ] which we present below relies heavily on the boundedness of @xmath0",
    ". we therefore leave it as an open problem to analyse the case of unbounded generators .",
    "before we give a proof of our main result in the next section , let us briefly fix some notation .",
    "if @xmath2 is a complex banach space , then we denote by @xmath55 the space of all bounded linear operators on @xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum of an operator @xmath56 is denoted by @xmath57 and for every @xmath58 , @xmath59 denotes the resolvent of @xmath0 at @xmath39 . for @xmath60 and @xmath24",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the open disk in @xmath62 with center @xmath63 and radius @xmath64 and by @xmath65 the closed disk in @xmath62 with center @xmath63 and radius @xmath64 .",
    "in this section we prove our main result . throughout the section",
    "we may assume that @xmath66 and we let @xmath28 .",
    "we want to find a norm estimate for the difference @xmath67 , where @xmath34 $ ] and where @xmath68 .",
    "to this end we employ the functional calculus for analytic functions and write @xmath69 \\ , d\\lambda   \\label{form : fc - representation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an appropriate path @xmath70 which encircles both the spectra of @xmath27 and @xmath32 . of course we could choose @xmath70 to be a sufficiently large circle , but this is too crude to obtain a reasonable estimate .",
    "hence , our first task is to localize the spectrum of @xmath27 more precisely in order to find a good choice for @xmath70 .    to do this",
    ", we first show a simple auxiliary result about the resolvent of our projection @xmath1 .",
    "[ lem : resolvent - of - projection ] let @xmath24 .",
    "* we have @xmath71 and for every @xmath72 , the resolvent of @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 * consider a non - negative parameter @xmath75 and the radius @xmath76 . if @xmath77 is contained in none of the closed disks @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then the resolvent @xmath80 fulfils the estimate @xmath81    loosely speaking , the estimate in ( b ) says that the resolvent @xmath80 decreases linearly as @xmath39 tends away from the points @xmath45 and @xmath63 .",
    "\\(a ) we clearly have @xmath71 since @xmath82 .",
    "the representation formulas for the resolvent can be verified by a simple computation .",
    "\\(b ) assume that @xmath83 ; then @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , at least one of the numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 is no less than @xmath88 since we have @xmath89 .",
    "since the other one is no less than @xmath90 , we conclude that @xmath91 .",
    "hence we conclude from the resolvent representation formula  ( [ form : resolvent - of - projection - long ] ) in ( a ) that @xmath92 which proves the assertion .",
    "now we can achieve our first goal and obtain very precise information on the position of the spectrum @xmath93 ; we also obtain a neumann type series representation for the resolvent :    [ prop : spectrum - of - shifted - generator ] let @xmath24 and consider the radius @xmath94 .    * the spectrum of @xmath95 is contained in the union of the two closed disks @xmath96 and @xmath97 . *",

    "if we apply lemma  [ lem : resolvent - of - projection](b ) with the parameter @xmath101 , then we obtain the estimate @xmath102 , and thus ( a ) and ( b ) follow by employing the neumann series .",
    "part ( a ) of the above proposition suggests a strategy to estimate the expression in  ( [ form : fc - representation ] ) : we rewrite the contour integral in  ( [ form : fc - representation ] ) as a sum of contour integrals around @xmath96 and @xmath97 ; the path of integration around the first disk should also be sufficiently large to encircle the spectrum of @xmath32 .",
