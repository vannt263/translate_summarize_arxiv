    "we present the relevant formulas in order to make some comments concerning the implementation of the method , and refer to the papers cited above for details of the sse scheme and the origin of these formulas .    if the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 are terms of the hamiltonian ( for example the dimer operators in the present case , which are heisenberg exchange operators ) , for a given operator string one has @xcite",

    "are strongly peaked at @xmath103 , and it is therefore not necessary to evaluate the full sums over @xmath92 ; for a given @xmath22 , a pre - computed @xmath92-range of sufficient width , meaning one containing approximately @xmath104 operators , can be used .",
    "nevertheless , these summations are time - consuming and can often dominate the computational effort . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a modified kernel was introduced in the analytic continuation to allow a different discretization of the correlation function ( [ eq : dcg ] ) used for the dimer correlations . here",
    "we choose to use the full form , thus avoiding a potential loss of frequency resolution due to the further convolution implied within the modified kernel . in order to ensure that the most time - consuming measurements are not carried out more often than necessary , by minimizing autocorrelations",
    ", we separate our measurements of the dimer - dimer correlation function by @xmath41 sse update sweeps .",
    "because spin - spin correlations are diagonal in the sse basis , we can adopt a different and faster approach than the form ( [ eq : dcd ] ) .",
    "we use a time - sliced form of the density matrix , @xmath105 and carry out the sse simulations with each of the time slices , @xmath106 , expanded individually .",
    "this allows easy access to all correlation functions of diagonal operators separated by times that are multiples of the step @xmath107 , simply by measuring the correlations in the propagated states at the boundaries between time slices .",
    "in most cases we use a quadratic time grid , instead of the uniform grid normally used , with the times in the set @xmath108 of the form @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "this kind of grid is useful when the inverse temperature , @xmath111 , is large , as it gives access to both short and long times with a reasonably small set of times ( typically numbering in tens rather than hundreds ) for which the covariance matrix @xcite required in analytic continuation can be computed properly . in fig .",

    "the imaginary - time correlation function of an operator @xmath112 , @xmath113 , is related to a corresponding spectral function , @xmath114 , according to @xmath115 where the kernel , @xmath116 , depends on the type of the spectral function .",
    "we wish to deduce the spectral function normally referred to as the dynamic structure factor ( for the spin or dimer operator , as defined in the main text ) , which has the spectral representation @xmath117 in terms of the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding matrix elements of the operator @xmath112 .    for the bosonic case studied here ,",

    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that when this this formulation is treated in a mean - field - type approximation , it reduces to the more commonly used maximum entropy ( me ) method @xcite . in general",
    ", one expects sac to resolve finer details of the spectrum than me , because it takes into account fluctuations around the mean - field solution , at the price of requiring long sampling times in certain cases ( refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite contain some discussion of this point ) .",
    "the most recent variant of the method @xcite , which we deploy here , reduces these sampling times considerably , typically delivering simple single - peak spectral functions in a few minutes or less , when running on a single core , and more complicated spectra , such as the cases with two well - separated peaks that we consider here , in under an hour .",
    "the sampling space is a large number , @xmath141 , of movable @xmath137-functions placed on a frequency grid with a spacing @xmath142 sufficiently fine as to be regarded in practice as a continuum ( e.g. , @xmath143 ) .",
    "the number @xmath144 can range from of the order @xmath145 for spectrums with little structure to @xmath146 or more more complicated spectra .",
    "the optimal number also depends on the quality ( statistical errors ) of the qmc data , with better data requiring larger @xmath144 for efficient sampling .    at a given instant ,",
    "the frequency of the @xmath147th @xmath137-function is @xmath148 , which is an integer multiple of @xmath142 .",
    "a sweep consisting of @xmath141 moves of the type @xmath149 is performed , with @xmath150 chosen randomly and the size of the change generated randomly within a window such that approximately half of the updates are accepted .",
    "the spectrum is accumulated in a histogram whose bin size is typically much larger than @xmath142 , and is chosen such that the features of the spectrum can be clearly resolved .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath137-functions are all the same , @xmath151 , with their value corresponding to a spectrum @xmath126 normalized to unity as discussed above .",
    "we stress that these amplitudes do not have to be changed , and a peak in the spectrum corresponds only to a high average density of @xmath137-functions within a corresponding region .",
    "we also carry out simultaneous updates of more than one @xmath137-function , a technique we will discuss in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the constant amplitudes are intended to reduce the amount of entropic bias @xcite in the spectrum , and tests indicate that this development does indeed improve the fidelity of the method .",
    "a further refinement is to not use the same amplitude for all @xmath137-functions , but to generate a range of varying amplitudes , such as @xmath152 ( with a prefactor chosen to satisfy the standard normalization ) , and this is the method we employ throughout the current analysis .",
    "these amplitudes are kept constant during the sampling process and , because there are no constraints on the locations of the @xmath137-functions , small amplitudes can migrate to areas with lower spectral weight .",
    "as long as @xmath141 is sufficiently large , we find no differences in the final averaged spectrum between the methods of uniform or varying amplitudes .",
    "however , the sampling efficiency is increased in the method of varying amplitudes , especially if we include an amplitude update of two @xmath137-functions of the type @xmath153 , @xmath154 , with @xmath147 and @xmath155 chosen randomly among all the @xmath137-functions . when sampling spectra with two or more peaks , this update causes considerable improvements in the efficiency of transferring weight between peaks .    .",

    "there is no significant spectral weight beyond the frequency ranges shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=274 ]    an important issue in sac is how to select the sampling temperature , @xmath139 .",
    "the general situation is that a very low @xmath139 freezes the spectrum close to a stable or metastable @xmath140 minimum , while a high @xmath139 leads to large @xmath140 values , i.e.  poor fits to the qmc data for @xmath127 .",
    "there is a range of @xmath139 over which the average @xmath140 value is small but the fluctuations are significant , and cause a smoothing of the spectrum .",
    "there is no agreement on exactly how @xmath139 should be chosen , but in general the different schemes proposed in the literature produce very similar results .",
    "this issue is similar to the various ways in which the entropic weighting of the spectrum can be chosen in the me method @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a simple temperature - adjustment scheme devised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a simulated annealing procedure is first carried out to find the minimum value @xmath156 ( in practice this is actually a value close to the minimum , as it may be very difficult to reach the exact global minimum of @xmath140 ) .",
    "after this initial step , @xmath139 is adjusted so that the average @xmath140 during the final sampling process for collecting the spectrum satisfies the criterion @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the number of time points in the qmc dataset for @xmath127 . with @xmath158",
    "replaced by @xmath159 ( the number of degrees of freedom in a simple fitting procedure ) the square - root term would be exactly the standard deviation of the @xmath140 distribution . with the spectrum constrained to positive frequencies , the number of degrees of freedom is not simply the difference @xmath160 , because the sampling parameters , which here are the @xmath141 frequencies , can not be considered as independent variables ( we note that typically @xmath161 so that @xmath159 from the naive definition would be negative and therefore meaningless ) .",
    "we therefore use instead the quantity @xmath162 , which typically will be one to two standard deviations of the distribution .",
    "this level of noise then corresponds roughly to the removal of distortions due to `` fitting to the statistical errors '' . in practice",
    ", we find the criterion ( [ eq : chi^2 ] ) to produce excellent spectra in tests both on synthetic imaginary - time data and on actual qmc results for systems with known spectral functions @xcite .",

    "<S> [ fig : higgss](a ) ] is dominated by the goldstone contribution , whose spectral weight is proportional to @xmath1 at @xmath59 ( becoming the magnetic bragg peak as @xmath20 ) , but the higgs mode nevertheless appears as a clearly resolved finite - energy peak ( as also observed experimentally in tlcucl@xmath0 @xcite ) . because longitudinal and transverse fluctuations can not be distinguished at @xmath55 , the higgs spectral weight also diverges as @xmath60 . away from @xmath55 , it remains as a finite - energy mode with convergent spectral weight . because the finite - size goldstone peak scales in energy as @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> , it remains subject to thermal broadening in our analysis ( where @xmath62 ) ; in contrast , we have confirmed that the higgs peak is not affected by thermal broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the peak widths are also stable with respect to increasing the amount of qmc data , and any artificial broadening arising from the sac procedures should therefore be minimal .    in @xmath31 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgss](b ) ] , the higgs contribution is the distinctive low - energy peak , which is separated by a region of suppressed spectral weight from a broad maximum representing lattice - scale fluctuations . in the thermodynamic limit , one expects an infrared tail with a characteristic scaling @xmath63 @xcite , but this is too weak to observe by sac and with the available system sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe good convergence with increasing @xmath41 in each of @xmath37 and @xmath56 , and further that the peak positions of each quantity also converge to the same value , as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this consistency between the @xmath15 and @xmath14 excitations provides strong confirmation that the peaks in the sac spectral functions do indeed correspond to the higgs mode . </S>",

    "<S> the collapse of the peaks indicates that our data represent the the quantum critical regime in the thermodynamic limit , and the proportionality of the peak widths to @xmath6 demonstrates that the higgs mode indeed is critically damped .    a universal scaling form for the scalar susceptibility ( dimer spectral function ) in the vicinity of the qcp </S>",

    "<S> for @xmath71 we obtain data collapse by appealing to the result @xcite that the integrated spectral weight diverges as @xmath78 when @xmath60 , which requires a rescaling by @xmath79 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgsw](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we may expect log corrections here as well @xcite , but , within the range of @xmath16-values considered , their effects on the data collapse are not detectable .    for a quantitative analysis of the spin and dimer higgs widths , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the error bars obtained by bootstrapping are significant , but it is clear that ( i ) the size dependence of @xmath82 and @xmath83 is weak , ( ii ) the dependence on @xmath16 is weak , and ( iii ) the dimer peaks are broader than the spin peaks by a factor of @xmath84 . to mitigate the large error bars , we use error - weighted averages of the width ratios obtained from all the @xmath16 values at each @xmath41 , and fit these to a quadratic polynomial in @xmath43 , as shown with the dashed curves in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : higgsw](c ) . this way we obtain estimates @xmath85 and @xmath86 of the near - critical ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , our sac value for @xmath87 on the double - cubic lattice is in excellent agreement with the neutron scattering results for tlcucl@xmath0 near its qcp @xcite . given the quite different lattices and couplings , this result mandates a deeper investigation of possible reasons for a very weak dependence on microscopic details . </S>",
    "<S> the much larger value of @xmath88 may reflect the different states probed by the two spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs part of the @xmath14 spectrum can be considered as the combination of a quantum - rotor excitation with the elementary @xmath15 higgs mode ( probed by the dimer spectrum ) , and indeed the finite - size spin peak lies higher in energy than the dimer peak [ inset , fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : higgss](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this composite nature of the @xmath89 excitation implies different matrix - element effects in the peak shapes , which are also evident in the different scaling forms of the peak areas in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : higgsw ] .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have used large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations to investigate the quantum critical dynamics of the amplitude ( higgs ) mode in a 3d dimerized antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> our work demonstrates that modern sac methods are capable of resolving complex spectral functions , here with two peaks and non - trivial scaling behavior of both the peak widths and heights . </S>",
    "<S> our results not only verify the scaling predictions based on field - theory methods but also provide line - width information and nonuniversal factors that lie beyond current analytical treatments . the type of calculations reported here can be performed for different momenta , to study the dispersion of the amplitude mode and the evolution of its width in the spin and dimer sectors , as well as for the lattice geometry and exchange couplings of tlcucl@xmath90 .    </S>",
