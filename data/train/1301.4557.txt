    "recently , many exotic hadrons observed in experiments are attracting our interest .",
    "they are expected to have unexpected structures , because their properties , such as quantum numbers , masses , and decay patterns , can not be explained by the ordinary picture of hadrons , baryons as @xmath11 and mesons as @xmath12 .",
    "as one of new aspects of these structures , the possibility of multiquarks or hadronic molecules have been extensively discussed . it is considered that , particularly near thresholds , hadronic molecules such as loosely bound or resonant states of meson - meson or meson - baryon emerge as one of hadronic configurations realized in nature . as typical candidates , the meson - meson molecules for @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been studied in the charm and bottom quark regions  @xcite .    the hadronic molecules as bound or resonant states formed by @xmath15 or @xmath16 meson ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 meson ) and a nucleon ( @xmath19 ) are also interesting . since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) molecules contain ordinary flavor structures of three quarks , they are intimately related to the ordinary heavy baryons , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and their excited states for the charm sector , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and their excited states for the bottom sector  @xcite .",
    "these excited states have been studied in the quark model extensively  @xcite . however , near the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) thresholds , it is expected that the wave functions of the quark model states have a large overlap with the component of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , and the properties of such baryon states are strongly affected by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) states",
    ". there would be even such states that are dominated by the molecular components .    in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) systems",
    ", there are two important symmetries ; the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry manifests in mass degeneracy of heavy pseudoscalar mesons @xmath26 , @xmath17 and vector mesons @xmath27 , @xmath28 in the heavy quark mass limit  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mass splitting between a @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) meson and a @xmath29 ( @xmath28 ) meson is small ; 140 mev for @xmath15 and @xmath29 mesons and 46 mev for @xmath17 and @xmath28 mesons .",
    "the small mass splittings in the heavy flavor sectors should be compared with the large mass splittings , @xmath30 mev for @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons , and @xmath33 mev for @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons , in the light flavor sectors .",
    "because of this , the heavy quark symmetry introduces the mixing of @xmath36 and @xmath37 states , where both @xmath38 and @xmath39 mesons are considered on the same footing as fundamental degrees of freedom in the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "then , physical states are given as a superposition of @xmath36 and @xmath37 states .",
    "for convenience , in the following , we denote @xmath40 to stand for @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "thanks to the mixing of states in @xmath41 systems , a long range force between a @xmath40 meson and a nucleon @xmath19 is supplied by one pion exchange with the same coupling strengths for @xmath42 and @xmath43 vertices  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the pion exchange can exist in @xmath41 systems . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is known that the pion exchange is important for the binding of atomic nuclei  @xcite . there",
    "the tensor force of the pion exchange that mixes channels with different angular momenta , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , yields a strong attraction to generate a rich structure of bound as well as resonant states .",
    "because the pion exchange is a long range force , it becomes more significant for states with larger orbital angular momenta .",
    "in fact , it was shown that , in the nucleon - nucleon scattering , the phase shifts in the channels with large orbital angular momenta are reproduced almost only by the pion exchange potential  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the pion exchange was also discussed in @xmath46 systems .",
    "it was investigated that the properties of bound and resonant states in @xmath46 systems are dramatically changed , if the tensor force is switched off  @xcite . in our previous studies",
    ", it was also shown that the pion exchange potential played a significant role for hadronic molecules such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 baryons  @xcite , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) mesons ( e.g. @xmath14 meson )  @xcite and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) mesons  @xcite .    in reality , however , the hadronic molecules of @xmath41 do not necessarily correspond to the observed states , because there should be couplings not only to three quark states but also to other meson - baryon states such as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , and so on . however , we may expect that such couplings are small for @xmath0 and @xmath2 baryons near the thresholds .",
    "the reasons are that the wave functions of hadronic molecules are spatially large as compared to the conventional three quark states , and that the transitions , e.g. from @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath54 ( @xmath57 ) , are suppressed by a heavy quark exchange . from those points of view , in the present discussion , we focus on the role of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 sectors and study the bound or resonant states generated by @xmath59 and @xmath60 . recently , there have been several studies of baryon states as @xmath59 ( @xmath60 )  @xcite and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 )  @xcite molecules .",
    "the present study is different from them in that we focus on the states near the thresholds and with a large angular momentum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the resonance energy is @xmath91 mev and the half decay width is @xmath92 mev as shown in table  [ tabledn ] . in the scattering state , we define the resonance energy @xmath93 by an inflection point of the phase shift  @xcite , and the decay width @xmath94 is given by @xmath95",
    ". when the @xmath96 potential is used , we find a bound state with a binding energy @xmath97 mev and with a relative radius @xmath98 fm . the mixing ratios of the bound state are 38.8 % for @xmath99 , 6.0 % for @xmath100 and 55.2 % for @xmath101 , as shown in table .  [ mixing ] .",
    "interestingly , @xmath101 is the most dominant channel , although the mass of @xmath4 is heavier than the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the attraction of tensor force is the strongest for @xmath101 channel .    for @xmath60 of @xmath90",
    ", we find bound states for both cases when the @xmath34 and @xmath96 potentials are used .",
    "the binding energies are @xmath102 mev for the @xmath34 potential and @xmath103 mev for the @xmath96 potential , and the relative radii are @xmath104 fm and @xmath105 fm , respectively . for the @xmath96 potential ,",
    "the mixing ratios of the bound state are 28.4 % for @xmath106 , 7.7 % for @xmath107 and 63.9 % for @xmath108 . in this case again , @xmath108 is the most dominant component regardless of its heavy mass .    for @xmath109 , we find a resonant @xmath0 state for the @xmath34 potential with the resonance energy @xmath110 mev and the half decay width @xmath111 mev as shown in table  [ tabledn ] .",

    "thus , @xmath115 is the dominant channel although its mass is heavier than the mass of @xmath114 ; once again a large attraction due to the tensor force is provided .    for @xmath60 state of @xmath109",
    ", we obtain bound states for both cases the @xmath34 and @xmath96 potentials are used .",

    "when the @xmath34 potential is used , we find a resonant state whose resonance energy is @xmath135 mev and half decay width is @xmath136 mev , while when the @xmath96 potential is used , we find a loosely bound state of a binding energy @xmath137 mev and a relative radius @xmath138 fm .",

    "the corresponding half decay widths are 671.9 mev and 375.4 mev , respectively .",
    "the difference between the results of the @xmath34 and @xmath96 potentials is once again small , due to the same reason as before with large angular momenta .",
    "for @xmath60 state , we also find resonant states above the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "the resonance positions are @xmath144 mev for the @xmath34 potential and @xmath145 mev for the @xmath96 potential .",

    "for @xmath160 , we find no bound nor resonant state .     and",
    "@xmath60 for @xmath161 when the @xmath96 potential is used .",
    "the same convention is used as fig.[figenergyleveli=0 ] .",
    "[ figenergyleveli=1 ] , width=566 ]      let us move to the states of isospin triplet ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "we summarize the results for @xmath59 and for @xmath60 in table  [ tabledn ] and show the energy levels in fig .",
    "[ figenergyleveli=1 ] . as a result",
    ", we find resonant states only for @xmath10 when the @xmath96 potential is employed .",
    "for @xmath59 , the resonance energy is @xmath162 mev and the half decay width is @xmath163 mev . for @xmath60 state",
    ", we obtain the resonance whose energy is @xmath164 mev and half width @xmath165 mev .",
    "the reason that there are not many states in isospin triplet channel can be understood as follows ; as compared to the isosinglet channel , the attractive force in the isotriplet channel is weak due to small isospin factor ; @xmath166 for isosinglet and @xmath167 for isotriplet .",
    "by solving coupled channel schrdinger equations for @xmath36 and @xmath168 channels , we find many bound and resonant states for @xmath169 and few resonances for @xmath161 . for these states ,",
    "the tensor force of the @xmath34 exchange potential plays a significant role to produce them .",
    "when we ignore the @xmath168 channels and solve the schrdinger equation only with @xmath36 channels , we find no bound state nor resonance .",
    "thus , the @xmath36-@xmath168 mixing and the @xmath34 exchange potential play an important role to generate a rich structure of molecular states .    the importance of the @xmath34 exchange potential stands out more in the bottom sector .",
    "the small mass difference between @xmath17 and @xmath28 mesons helps to yield the strong attraction because it induces the strong @xmath2-@xmath5 mixing with the tensor force .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath60 has heavier reduced mass and hence the kinetic term is suppressed . for these reasons ,",
    "the binding energies of @xmath60 states are larger than these of @xmath59 states .    when we compare the results of the @xmath34 potential and of the @xmath96 potential , they are quite different for @xmath6 , @xmath131 with @xmath169 , where the @xmath35 and @xmath65 exchange potentials become important to produce attraction . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 states ,",
    "both @xmath35 and @xmath65 exchange potentials are attractive , and hence they increase the binding energy significantly . on the other hand , for @xmath122 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the results for the @xmath96 potential are similar to those for the @xmath34 potential . for large @xmath170 states ,",
    "the @xmath34 exchange potential plays a dominant role to generate bound and resonant states , while the @xmath35 and @xmath65 exchanges play only a minor one .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that these states have large orbital angular momenta .",
    "if relevant channels include large orbital angular momenta , the wave functions tend to extend spatially , and the long range force , namely the @xmath34 exchange potential , becomes important while the short range force is suppressed .      in the present study",
    ", we discuss the molecular structure formed by the @xmath41 bound and resonant states .",
    "however , the hadronic molecular picture is not applicable to deeply bound states with small radii . for such states ,",
    "the constituent hadrons , namely @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) meson and nucleon , overlap each other , and therefore we have to consider short range effects such as an internal structure of hadrons , channel couplings to conventional three quark states and so on . as a naive criterion for the hadronic molecule , we have shown the relative radii of the bound states as discussed in ref  @xcite .",
    "if the size of the bound state is larger than twice of typical hadron size ( namely 1 fm ) , the state could be well described by a molecular structure . for resonant states ,",
    "we identify the states as the hadronic molecule .",
    "according to the criterion , for the @xmath96 potential , only the bound state for @xmath122 of @xmath60 constructs a hadronic molecule , where the relative radius is 1.81 fm .",
    "contrary to this , the bound states for @xmath6 and @xmath131 with @xmath169 which have a small radius and a large binding energy are not described as simple molecules . we need to consider the short range effects including various channel couplings to do more realistic discussions .",
    "we have investigated heavy baryons as hadronic molecules formed by a heavy meson and a nucleon , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the interaction is given by the meson exchange potential with respecting the heavy quark and chiral symmetries .",
    "many bound states and resonances are found in isosinglet channel both for @xmath59 and @xmath60 systems . in contrast , there are few resonances in isotriplet channel due to small isospin factor . for @xmath6 and @xmath131 ,",
    "we have found deeply bound states far below @xmath0 or @xmath2 threshold with a small radius . in these states ,",
    "the vector meson exchange potential yields a strong attraction . in order to perform more realistic discussions for such compact states , we need to consider further effects from internal structures of constituent hadrons and channel couplings to quark intrinsic states . on the other hand , for @xmath122 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with large orbital angular momenta ,",
    "the one pion exchange potential is favored and we have obtained loosely bound states and resonances near the thresholds . there",
    "the short range interactions are rather inactive and the long range force of the one pion exchange dominates , where the tensor force plays an important role to generate these states , and they compose the hadronic molecular structure .",
    "it is expected that the hadronic molecular states from a heavy meson and a nucleon are studied in many accelerator facilities ; the @xmath15 meson production in the antiproton - nucleon annihilation process in fair  @xcite and the heavy ion collision in rhic and lhc  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the exotic baryons are investigated in j - parc in the coming future .",
