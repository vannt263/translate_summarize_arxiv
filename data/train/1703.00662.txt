    "enhancing the reliability of communication , even enduring low data rate , is one of the 5 g wireless system design factors @xcite .",
    "previously , many researchers have focused on the downlink ( dl ) traffic due to its greater volume compared to the uplink ( ul ) traffic .",
    "recently , ul traffic has increased because of new mobile applications and the massive growth of internet - of - things ( iot ) applications .",
    "many iot applications have an intensive ul traffic by their sensing and monitoring characteristics @xcite .",
    "for this reason , enhancing the reliability of ul transmission as important as that of dl transmission .    increasing the number of base stations ( bss ) per area , _ network densification _ , is one way to increase the reliability . by taking advantage of multiple proximate and interconnected bss , a bs cooperation in same transmission direction",
    "is considered in terms of coordinated multipoint transmission ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 can increase the reliability performance , however , @xmath1 considers cooperation between the bss with the same direction of traffic .    in @xcite , a cooperation scheme for serving cross directional ( ul and dl ) traffic simultaneously utilizing separated half duplex bss",
    "is proposed and investigated , and is termed @xmath2 : @xmath1 for in - band wireless full - duplex .",
    "the limitation of @xcite is that the traffic is assumed always cross directional . in general , the cooperative bss could serve the same or opposite direction of traffic .",
    "this means that the reliability might be improved if the network can support both @xmath1 and @xmath2 according to the traffic . in this paper",
    ", we propose @xmath0 , a user - centric base station ( bs ) cooperation scheme that provides improvements in reliability of both uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) communications of wireless cellular networks .",
    "the proposed @xmath0 can support not only cooperation of two bss with same direction of traffic but also cooperation of two bss serving bidirectional traffic .",
    "we will show that the reliability performance of @xmath0 by analytical expressions and numerical simulations .",
    "we quantify and numerically validate the performance and complexity of the greedy bs pairing algorithm by comparing the edmonds matching algorithm for weighted graphs , one of maximum weight matching methods .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we describe the system model of the proposed scheme .",
    "the reliability analysis of proposed scheme is given in section  iii , and its numerical results are presented in section  iv .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  v.",
    "we propose a combined @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath0 ) bs cooperation scheme , which can support not only cooperation of two bss with same direction of traffic but also cooperation when the bss serve opposite directions of traffic .",
    "we consider a pair of cooperating bss .",
    "they are interconnected via a wired connection ( double solid line in fig .",
    "[ f : comp2flex ] ) .",
    "if both bss serve dl traffic , dynamic cell selection ( dcs ) is used ( fig .",
    "[ f : dlcomp ] ) .",
    "dcs serves one user in a cell first , and then serves the user in the other cell .",
    "if both bss serve ul traffic , @xmath1 reception with coordinated scheduling is used , i.e. , only one user in one cell will transmit and the user in the other cell will transmit later ( fig .  [",
    "f : ulcomp ] ) .",
    "lastly , if the bss serve cross directional traffic , one bs will operate in dl ( dl - bs ) and the other in ul ( ul - bs ) , or vice - versa ( fig .",
    "[ f : compflex ] ) . the ul - bs uses side information sent from the dl - bs through the wired backhaul , for interference cancellation .    to quantify the performance of @xmath0 , we assume that the bss are randomly distributed with density @xmath3 , resulting in a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xcite . the mobile stations ( mss )",
    "are associated with the nearest bs , and each bs serves one ms using the same resource at a time .",
    "we assume that each ms , independently of one another , selects its transmission direction with a certain probability @xmath4 .",
    "we can define a random variable @xmath5 for the traffic direction , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the traffic asymmetry of the network can be adjusted by changing @xmath4 . a single frequency and rayleigh fading channel with unit mean power is assumed .",
    "@xmath8 is the path - loss function with path loss exponent @xmath9 .",
    "the default transmit power of uplink users is @xmath10 .",
    "bss transmit with constant power @xmath11 .",
    "a downlink ( uplink ) signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) requirement is denoted by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the term @xmath14 is additive white gaussian noise .",
    "the transmission is successfully received if the received sinr is greater than or equal to the target threshold value .",
    "each bs can cooperate with an adjacent bs paired by an algorithm explained in the next subsection .",
    "for pairing the bss , we use two different methods .",
    "the first method is a greedy pairing algorithm , which operates as follows : given a bs deployment , the algorithm starts with a bs chosen uniformly at random .",
    "it then lists all neighboring bss and selects the closest one , in terms of euclidean distance .",
    "these two bss are then considered a _",
    "pair_. the algorithm then select the next unpaired bs , lists its unpaired neighbors , and pairs it with the nearest one . when there are no more bss that can be paired , the algorithm terminates .",
    "assuming there are @xmath15 bss , an upper bound on the complexity is @xmath16,which is of order @xmath17 . to be simple",
    ", we restrict the candidate bss to the bss sharing the same edge , so called delaunay neighbors .",
    "each bs only needs the knowledge about its delaunay neighbors , i.e. , it is a local method .",
    "the second method is the edmonds matching algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm needs the knowledge of the entire network , i.e. , it is a global method . in this method ,",
    "the network is modeled as a weighted planar graph @xmath18 , where the vertex set @xmath19 contains the bss , and @xmath20 is the edge set , representing connections between the bss .",
    "there is an edge @xmath21 if and only if the bss represented by the endpoints of @xmath22 are adjacent in the deployment .",
    "the _ weight _ of an edge @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is the distance between the bss .",
    "the goal of the edmonds matching algorithm is to find a maximal matching ( i.e. , containing as many edges as possible ) , while minimizing the total weight .",
    "note that in this case , the distance between the typical bs and its paired bs might be quite high , since the algorithm looks at the entire network .",
    "our motivations for studying this algorithm are twofold : first , for planar graphs , there exist implementations with complexity @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the exponent of the best matrix multiplication algorithm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exponent satisfies @xmath26 , which is lower than in the greedy method .",
    "second , we will use the edmonds matching algorithm to validate the greedy pairing algorithm .",
    "based on the system model presented in this section , we will derive the analytical forms of the transmission success probabilities in ul and dl representing reliability in the next section .",
    "in this section , we investigate the reliability performance of @xmath0 by deriving analytical expressions for the transmission success probabilities in ul and dl . for the analytical tractability",
    ", we assume that all bss in the network can schedule the one _ active _ mobile station ( ms ) either ul ( ul - ms ) or dl ( dl - ms ) in each voronoi cell .",
    "we further assume that the spatial distribution of mss follows the another independent ppp with the density @xmath3 .",
    "the success probability of transmission of a typical ul user @xmath27 at a typical bs @xmath28 in @xmath0 @xmath29 can be expressed as follows : @xmath30 \\right ] \\\\      & = { \\mathbb{e}}\\left [ \\pr \\left [ g_{\\mathcal{u},b\\(\\mathcal{u}\\ ) } \\geq \\frac{\\beta_\\mathrm{u } r^\\alpha}{p_\\mathrm{m } } \\ (   i_{b\\(\\mathcal{u}\\)}^\\psi+i_{b\\(\\mathcal{u}\\)}^\\varphi \\ ) \\right ] \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the gain of the channel at @xmath32 from @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the aggregate interference at node @xmath33 from dl - bss and ul - mss , respectively .",

    "we can conclude that the impact of bs - bs interference cancellation benefits of @xmath0 , suggesting it be suitable for cooperation in cross directional traffic and its time sharing nature brings the benefits in the cooperation of same directional traffic .",
