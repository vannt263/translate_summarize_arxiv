    "the lorenz flow @xcite is one of the key examples in the theory of dynamical systems due to the chaotic nature of its dynamics , its robustness and its connection with hydrodynamical systems .",
    "the lorenz attractor , a ` strange attractor ' with a characteristic butterfly shape , has extremely rich dynamical properties which have been studied from a variety of viewpoints : topological , geometric and statistical , see @xcite .",
    "part of the reason for the richness of the lorenz flow is the fact that it has an equilibrium , i.e. a fixed point , accumulated by regular orbits ( orbits through points where the corresponding vector field does not vanish ) which prevents the flow from being uniformly hyperbolic .",
    "indeed it is one of the motivating examples in the study of non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "it is also robust in the sense that nearby flows also possess strange attractors with similar properties .",
    "the lorenz equations can be studied using geometric models of the lorenz flow , see @xcite .",
    "it was shown by tucker @xcite that the lorenz equations do indeed support a geometric lorenz flow .",
    "the classical geometric lorenz flow is expanding .",
    "this corresponds to the lyapunov exponents at the origin , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the stable and unstable exponents respectively , having @xmath5 .",
    "a rovella - like attractor @xcite is the maximal invariant set of a geometric flow whose construction is very similar to the one that gives the geometric lorenz attractor , @xcite , except for the fact that the eigenvalue relation @xmath6 there is replaced by @xmath7 . as in the case for the geometric lorenz attractor ,",
    "a rovella attractor has a global cross section : a line @xmath8 , and a first return map @xmath9 defined on @xmath10 that preserves a one - dimensional foliation which is contracted under the action of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , as in the case of the geometrical model for the lorenz flow , it is possible to study the dynamics of a rovella flow through a @xmath11-dimensional map obtained quotienting though the leaves of this contracting foliation . unlike the one - dimensional lorenz map obtained from the usual construction of the geometric lorenz attractor , a one - dimensional rovella map has a criticality at the origin , caused by the eigenvalue relation @xmath12 . in figure  [ fig - lorenz3d ] below we present some possible `` rovella one - dimensional maps '' obtained through quotienting out the stable direction of the return map to the global cross - section of the attractor . in section",
    "[ sec : constructionrovella ] we explain this procedure .    in this paper we will study the geometric model of the rovella - like attractor from the point of view of thermodynamic formalism",
    "this theory studies the multifractal properties of the system ( see @xcite ) , providing precise characterisations of the dimension theory , as well as giving insight into the statistical properties of the system . in the study of thermodynamic formalism ,",
    "one takes a dynamical system @xmath13 and a relevant potential @xmath14 and studies the statistical properties of the system through the properties of the pressure and the equilibrium states of the triple @xmath15 .",
    "this theory was developed for hyperbolic dynamical systems by sinai , ruelle and bowen @xcite in the context of hlder potentials on hyperbolic dynamical systems , and has mainly been applied to axiom a systems and anosov diffeomorphisms , see e.g.  @xcite .    the potentials which tell us most about the system involve the jacobean of the flow / map .",
    "for discrete smooth conformal systems one would consider @xmath16 .",
    "knowledge of the pressure and equilibrium states with respect to the family @xmath17 , the family of ` natural / geometric ' potentials , give us very fine information on the expansion properties of the system .",
    "this is the lyapunov spectrum . for discrete uniformly hyperbolic systems",
    "the theory of thermodynamic formalism is already fairly well developed , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , for discrete conformal non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems the theory is currently seeing a lot of activity , for example @xcite . in the case of flows",
    ", thermodynamic formalism has been studied in the hyperbolic case in @xcite . in the non - uniformly hyperbolic case ,",
    "the main contribution was made by barreira and iommi @xcite who considered thermodynamic formalism for suspension flows over countable markov shifts .",
    "to understand the jacobean for the lorenz flow we note that the tangent space can be split into three directions : the flow direction , which has neutral expansion , the expanding / unstable direction and the contracting / stable direction .",
    "the study of the lyapunov spectrum in the rovella flow case is particularly complicated since , in contrast to the expanding lorenz case , we have to deal with points where a derivative is zero .",
    "the interesting part of the dynamics is in the expanding part of the attractor , so we consider the jacobean restricted to the expanding direction",
    ". this situation can be modelled by a suspension flow over a countable markov shift as in @xcite , but our approach uses a simpler suspension flow allied to the results of iommi and todd @xcite .",
    "( note that in @xcite a countable markov shift was used to produce the equilibrium states and information on the lyapunov spectra . )",
    "our analysis captures the points which are typical for the physical measure as well as for many other points captured by nearby measures .",
    "as mentioned above , we use the common approach ( see @xcite ) of analysing lorenz - like flows by taking poincar sections in such a way that we obtain a one - dimensional map . note that our results hold for a larger class of maps than just the rovella type of lorenz flow .",
    "we consider flows which have a poincar section with the dynamics of maps considered in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "as sketched in the introduction , we prove the existence of an equilibrium state for the potential @xmath18 for maps @xmath19 in a class @xmath20 of flows that includes a contracting lorenz flow introduced in @xcite .",
    "this is the natural potential to consider for these maps . indeed ,",
    "analysis of this potential also allows us to express the lyapunov spectrum of the flow in terms of the pressure .",
    "recall that a _ contracting lorenz flow @xmath21 _ is a flow with a unique singularity at the origin @xmath22 , defined in a compact neighbourhood @xmath23 of @xmath22 satisfying the following properties :    ( ) 1.0 mm 0.0 mm    the restriction of the flow to a small neighbourhood @xmath24 is a linear flow @xmath25 with a unique singularity at @xmath22 ,    the eigenvalues @xmath26 of @xmath27 are all real and satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that , under certain additional conditions , the maximal positive @xmath21-invariant set @xmath29 is a transitive attractor .    in order to give our main results for these systems",
    "we first need to introduce some basic notions from thermodynamic formalism . for references on the general theory , see for example @xcite .",

    "a measure @xmath40 maximising the free energy , i.e. with @xmath41 , is called an _ equilibrium state_.",
    "similarly for a flow @xmath21 , we define the set of @xmath21-invariant measures as @xmath42 moreover , for a potential @xmath43 , the pressure of @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 ( for more details of the entropy of flows , see section  [ sec : therm for flows ] , in particular . )    for a flow @xmath46 in our class @xmath20 , as in @xcite at each point @xmath47 , the tangent space for the flow @xmath21 has a splitting @xmath48 where @xmath49 is tangent to the stable direction and @xmath50 is tangent to the centre unstable direction ( see section  [ sec : constructionrovella ] for more details ) .",
    "we are interested in the potential @xmath51 which is the jacobean of the differential in the centre unstable direction at the point @xmath52 .",
    "this potential gives rise to a natural class of equilibrium states , which can be seen as selecting out the sets in @xmath53 with different rates of asymptotic expansion by the flow ( see also theorem  [ thm : lyap spec flow ] ) .",
