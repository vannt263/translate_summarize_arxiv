    "combinations of x - ray and radio observations have revealed the large - scale interactions between radio jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the intra - cluster medium ( icm ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray surface brightness depressions , or x - ray cavities , are seen in the icm , the position of which correlates with that of the synchrotron emitting radio galaxy lobes at ghz - frequencies , e.g. ngc  1275 in perseus @xcite , cygnus  a @xcite , hydra  a  ( @xcite , and references therein ) and several other clusters @xcite .",
    "agn inject large amounts of energy into the icm in the form of relativistic , magnetised and collimated plasma jets .",
    "these seem to be active for periods of some  tens  of  myr @xcite .",
    "the jets drive strong shocks in the icm which is consequently heated ( @xcite ; reynolds , heinz & begelman 2001 ; @xcite ) .",
    "jet plasma and magnetic fields  inflate a cavity , the `` cocoon '' , which expands and displaces the ambient medium plasma @xcite .",
    "the material inside cocoons is responsible the observed radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the interaction between agn jets and the icm has been modelled as a hydrodynamical process @xcite .",
    "it is well established however that magnetic fields  thread the icm .",
    "radio polarimetry is the major source of information about cluster magnetic fields ( cmfs ) .",
    "the agn radio emission is typically polarized @xcite and the intervening magnetised icm gives rise to faraday rotation ( @xcite , and references therein ; for a review see @xcite ) , which is characterized by the rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "maps of this quantity have been produced using radio sources located within the icm or behind it , as well as using cluster radio halos ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution in rm images , along with the assumption that cmfs vary over a single scale , has lead to estimates of the strength of cmfs within in the cool - core clusters cygnus  a , hydra  a , a1795  and 3c  295  ( see @xcite , respectively ) , within in the non - cool core clusters coma , a119 , 3c129  ( see @xcite , respectively ) and also in a2634  and a400 @xcite .",
    "the rm also suggests that cmfs located in the cores of clusters are stronger than those in their outer regions @xcite .",
    "a correlation between the rm values and the mass deposition rates of cluster cooling flows has been detected as well @xcite .",
    "the structure of cmfs seems to be mainly related to turbulence .",
    "this has been inferred using the spatial variation of observed faraday rotation images and their statistical properties @xcite , in particular , the shape of the rm structure functions @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the rm images of a119 and modelled its magnetic fields  with a three - dimensional multi - scale tangled geometry .",
    "they used spatial variations of the field characterized by a magnetic power spectrum following a power law in fourier space .",
    "murgia et  al .",
    "found that both the mean and the standard deviation of the rm , which are used to estimate the strength of cmfs , depend on the magnetic spectral index , @xmath0 .",
    "they conclude that @xmath12 produces the best fit to the observations in  a119 . with a similar approach",
    "@xcite reported spectral power law slope fits at the core of  a2255 , and of @xmath24 at the outer parts .",
    "also , indexes close to 11@xmath33 have been estimated in  a2382 @xcite , a400 ,  a2634 and hydra  a @xcite .",
    "models of the evolution of cmfs suggest that the fields structure is shaped by the dynamics of the icm via magnetic flux freezing and ideal mhd which is a good approximation in clusters ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . in this context",
    ", cmfs should follow the icm advection closely , particularly the one driven by agn jets .",
    "turbulence in the icm is expected to be produced during cluster formation and mergers @xcite , as well as by agn outflows ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "turbulent icm flows are thus believed to amplify cmfs from weak seed fields to the observed microgauss regime by the formation of local small - scale dynamos ( see @xcite , for a numerical review ) .",
    "characteristic depolarization gradients are often observed between the main hotspots of several powerful radio galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite have explained such features using path length differences between each of the radio lobes and the edge of the observed x - ray emitting icm that contains them .",
    "the rm map of the fanaroff - riley class  i ( fr  i , @xcite ) radio source hydra  a  shows opposite signs in the approaching and the receding radio lobes @xcite . @xcite have described these rm fluctuations with synthetic three - dimensional faraday screens characterized by ( i ) a random distribution of magnetic fields , ( ii ) a spherically symmetric gas distribution , ( iii ) axisymmetric prolate - spheroid cavities resembling the geometry of the faraday screen projected by hydra  a. these 3d differential faraday screen models are consistent with the radio source expansion framework of @xcite and also with observations of x - ray cavities .",
    "the rm gradients in question , therefore , imply that agn jets make their way by pushing the icm gas and its magnetic fields at once .",
    "this process was recently studied by @xcite with high resolution multi - frequency images of faraday rotation and depolarization of the radio galaxies 0206 + 35 , m  84 , 3c  270 and 3c  353 .",
    "the latter is an extended fanaroff  riley class  ii ( fr  ii ) radio source such as the ones that we model in this paper .",
    "guidetti et  al",
    ". reported , for the first time , well defined rm bands , with very little small - scale structure , perpendicular to the major axis of the radio lobes of these galaxies .",
    "also , they use a simple time - independent model of both the radio source compression and the ambient medium magnetic fields to generate the rm bands in synthetic observations .",
    "observations of cmfs are limited by the resolution and sensitivity of telescopes .",
    "many questions about these fields are still open ( see @xcite , for a review ) . at least for powerful",
    "fr  ii sources there seems to be little mixing of icm plasma with the synchrotron - emitting one ; the observed rm distribution is caused by plasma external to the radio source @xcite .",
    "the interaction of expanding radio sources with the magnetised icm should happen locally to the sources .",
    "an important question here is how significant this process is when interpreting rm observations as indicators of the properties of both the cmfs and the icm gas themselves .",
    "the ska @xcite , evla , e - merlin , lofar and xeus ( the new generation of telescopes ) are planned to have ultra - high sensitivity and sub - arc - second resolution which will allow a better understanding about the cosmological evolution and structure of cmfs .",
    "e.g. we will understand important details about the icm turbulence ( see e.g. @xcite ) and its heat conduction ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is the second of two papers in which we use numerical simulations to study the evolution of magnetic fields in fanaroff - riley class  ii jets and their immediate cluster surroundings . in this work",
    "we introduce a combination of 3dmhd and synthetic rm numerical simulations .",
    "we follow the large - scale interaction of powerful radio jets from an fr  ii radio source with the magnetic fields  in the core of a non - cool core cluster .",
    "the structure , the evolution and the polarised synchrotron emission of the radio sources themselves are discussed in our earlier paper ( huarte - espinosa , krause & alexander , 2011 ; paper  1 ) . here we concentrate on the structure of the icm and the feedback from radio sources .",
    "we only follow the evolution of the sources while jets are active .",
    "the behaviour of both energetics and magnetic power spectra ( in fourier space ) of cmfs is explored as a function of position in the two - dimensional parameter space defined by the velocity and density of the jets .",
    "synthetic rm maps are produced at different viewing angles to investigate the observational signatures of expanding radio sources .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ simul ] we briefly describe the formalism of ideal mhd , the numerical methods we use and write about our implementation of the icm , the cmfs and agn jets .",
    "the results of our simulations are presented in section  [ results ] along with their interpretation and analysis from the point of view of energetics , rm statistics and magnetic power spectra in fourier space .",
    "both the implications and applications of our work are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "there , we also examine the well - studied case of hydra  a  and finish by commenting about our model assumptions .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclu ] we summarise the main results of our work and present our conclusions .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the plasma in the icm and agn radio jets , we use the system of nonlinear time - dependent hyperbolic equations of ideal compressible mhd . in three  dimensions and non - dimensional conservative form ,",
    "these are given by :    @xmath4 & = &     \\dot{e}_j     \\\\",

    "we solve the equations of ideal mhd in three  dimensions using the numerical code flash  3.1 @xcite .",
    "flash s new multidimensional unsplit constrained transport ( ct ) solver is employed to maintain the divergence of magnetic fields down @xcite . a diffusive hllc solver @xcite prevents spurious low pressure and density values from appearing in the grid .",
    "we use a courant - friedrichs - lewy parameter of  0.25 and periodic boundary conditions in all the domain s faces .",
    "these boundary conditions prevent numerical noise from polluting the magnetic spectrum in the grid ( section  [ cmfs ] ) .",
    "our computational domain is a cube with edges @xmath12  computational units ( which represent a volume of 200kpc@xmath13 ) , cartesian coordinates and a uniform grid with 200@xmath13  cells .",
    "we present six simulations to study the effects of active agn jets on the magnetic fields  in the core of a non - cool core cluster .",
    "five simulations , which we refer to as _ jets - simulations _ , are designed to experiment with the power of the jets .",
    "we do this by varying their velocities and densities .",
    "these jet - simulations are the same that we present in paper  1 .",
    "the other simulation , the _ no - jets _ model , is carried out in order to follow the evolution of the icm plasma without any perturbations throughout the same simulation timesteps as the jet - simulations .",
    "all of these models are labelled descriptively and summarised in table  1 .",
    "see paper  1 for a discussion about the low densities and hypersonic velocities of the jets .",
    ".simulations and parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]      in order to investigate the effects that jets have on the structure of cmfs , we calculate three - dimensional magnetic power spectra in fourier space using the output from our simulations . specifically , we use the magnetic fields of the five jets - simulations which were produced at @xmath14 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure  [ pow - jets ] .",
    "for this computation we exclude the volume that is occupied by the sources ( we use the spatial distribution of the jets tracer , section  [ cocoon ] ) .    in general we find that the spectra preserve the initial condition of a power - law with a kolmogorov index ( section  [ cmfs ] ) .",
    "yet the energy injection from the jets produces power enhancements on scales that range from the resolution limit , 1kpc , to the source size , @xmath1540kpc .",
    "an interesting feature that we see is a flattening on the power spectra at the scale defined by the cocoon size figure  [ pow - jets ] .",
    "this effect depends on the power of the jets .",
    "as radio sources expand , the energy of the jets is transferred to the icm gas and cmfs in the shocked ambient region . there , magnetic field lines are compressed and stretched tangentially to the surface area of the radio cocoons ( section  [ visit ] ) .",
    "hence , we find that fatter or more spherical cocoons , such as the ones produced by the `` lighter '' jets , are more efficient in increasing and redistributing the energy of the cmfs .    the scales at which the jets affect the cmfs are more evident in figure  [ pow - ratio ] .",
    "there we plot the ratio of the power spectra in figure  [ pow - jets ] over the corresponding spectra computed using the `` no - source '' simulation .",
    "i.e. for each plot in figure  [ pow - ratio ] , we use the corresponding profile in figure  [ pow - jets ] as the numerator .",
    "the spectrum in the denominator is calculated in the following way : ( i ) we combine the magnetic fields of the `` no - source '' run at @xmath16 with the cocoon spatial distribution of the corresponding jets - simulation at @xmath16 .",
    "( ii ) the magnetic fields inside the cocoon are removed .",
    "this yields a cube filled with magnetic fields , which have not been affected by the jets at all , and an empty cavity in the middle .",
    "the geometry of such cavity exactly matches the shape and orientation of the cocoon s contact surface .",
    "( iii ) we compute the 3d magnetic power spectrum of these fields .",
    "we note the numerical diffusion of the simulations is cancelled in the computation of the profiles shown in figure  [ pow - ratio ] .",
    "gradients in these spectral ratio profiles persistently show maxima close to  , as well as a roughly constant and progressive increase from scales close to  10kpc down see figure  [ pow - ratio ] .",
    "these features are related to the source energy and momentum injection scales and also to the thickness of the ambient medium swept - up region .",
    "this gas component expands as the sources evolve towards a thermal pressure equilibrium state with the icm gas ( figure  [ pressevo ] ) , and reaches scales of about  10kpc at the end of the simulations .",
    "we see that the expansion and size of our model cocoons are clearly linked to the enhancement of the cmf power spectra at large - scales .",
    "the cocoons which are formed by the lightest , fast jets are bigger and have more isotropic gas and energy distributions ( see section  [ energetics ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figtopo ] illustrates the deformation of the cmfs topology that is caused by the `` lighter - fast '' source at @xmath1790@xmath18 and @xmath195.3myr .",
    "the cocoon is marked by dots and it clearly stretches and compresses the neighbouring magnetic field lines , particularly ahead of the jets working surface .",
    "+ .2 cm .2 cm    @xcite have demonstrated that there is a correlation between the statistical properties of the rm distribution , in the real space , and the structure of magnetic fields  in the three - dimensional frequency space .",
    "based on these facts we compute the rm structure functions of those of our synthetic rm maps that correspond to @xmath16 and @xmath1745@xmath18 .",
    "the structure function is given by @xmath20 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the @xmath21 non - zero rm pixels that are inside bins ( annuli ) centred at @xmath22 and have radii of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ struct ] shows the rm structure functions in question . at the end of the simulations ,",
    "the structure functions generally still show the power law that we have used as the initial conditions of the simulations ( section  [ cmfs ] ) . yet these curves considerably flatten at scales of order  tens of kpc .",
    "the structure functions rise again from a certain scale on .",
    "we see that this scale is larger for that sources with fatter cocoons .",
    "the flat regions therefore seem to be directly related to the cocoon width .",
    "this is consistent with our findings in the 3d magnetic power spectra at the frequency space figure  [ pow - jets ] .",
    "a combination of 3d - mhd numerical simulations and synthetic rm observations have been produced and presented .",
    "these simulations follow the evolution and observational signatures of cmfs under the effects of powerful jets from an agn in the core of a non - cool core cluster . to understand the basic physics of this interaction , the effects from other cluster galaxies , synchrotron cooling , magnetic reconnections and observational factors ( such as beaming , depolarization and light travel effects )",
    "have not been considered in the model .",
    "we have focussed on the role that the jet velocity , the jet density and the observational viewing angle play on the jets - cmfs interaction .",
    "plasma energetics , rm statistics and magnetic power spectra consistently indicate that cmfs are affected by agn jets .",
    "the effect depends on the jets properties ; the lighter and the faster the jets , the more important the results they have on the ambient medium .",
    "the shape of the cmf energetics profiles ( figure  [ fig : energy ] ) is consistent with the following arguments .",
    "radio sources expand due to the energy injection from jets .",
    "the cocoons displace the icm gas and magnetic fields from the cavity , compressing them into the region located between the contact surface and the bow shock ( figures  [ colormaps ] and [ figtopo ] ) .",
    "these cmf lines are also stretched in this process .",
    "the magnetic component tangential to the surface of the radio cocoons is therefore enhanced .",
    "as the sources expand , the cocoon pressure decays and the compression caused by bow shocks weakens ( figure  [ pressevo ] ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with radio source evolution models ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "once the sources with mach  40  jets ( green and dark - blue curves , figure  [ pressevo ] ) have expanded for about 100kpc , their cocoon thermal pressure is comparable with that in the environment .",
    "thus only these relatively slow sources are not powerful enough to significantly affect the magnetic energy of the icm .",
    "our rm integration neglects the contribution from icm gas and magnetic fields beyond the computational domain .",
    "jet - produced rm enhancements are local , important at the edge of the sources and should not depend on this outer rm component .",
    "observations show that both the cluster ion density and the strength of the cmfs decreases away from the cluster core ( @xcite ;  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "thus we expect to capture the major contribution to the rm by our procedure .",
    "since the region we use for the analysis is spherical , any additional contribution to the rm is expected to be statistically spatially uniform .",
    "[ fig : hydra ]      @xcite have recently reported bands in the observed rm images of the fr  ii radio sources 3c353 and cygnus  a , as well as in the fri sources 0206 + 35 , m84 and 3c270 .",
    "these bands are perpendicular to the major axis of the radio lobes and are characterized by very little small - scale rm structure . to explain the nature of such features , guidetti et  al .",
    "present synthetic rm observations generated with a simple model of gas with constant density and magnetic field distributions .",
    "this plasma is then affected by compression induced by an elliptical cavity that is artificially placed inside the gas .",
    "the model allows these authors to conclude that there are three magnetic field components associated with observed rm : an isotropic field which has large - scale fluctuations , plausibly associated with the undisturbed icm ; a well - ordered field draped around the leading edges of the radio lobes ; a field with small - scale fluctuations which is located in the shells of compressed gas surrounding the inner lobes .",
    "we do not use an ordered magnetic field component in our model and do not observe rm bands in our synthetic images .",
    "thus we confirm the findings of guidetti et  al .",
    ", namely that without any ordered field component in the icm , the radio source expansion will not lead to banded rm structures . in addition , our model shows that source - induced rm variations can be as large as 70% , are correlated with the radio jet properties , depend on time and are stronger at the edge of the cocoons .",
    "this is a very important point because the observed rm signal is used to infer the strength of the cmfs ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".2 cm + .5 cm    .2",
    "cm    [ lobes ]    our synthetic rm maps persistently show pronounced gradients at regions corresponding to the receding radio lobes ( the left ones ) relative to the approaching ones ( figures  [ rm - lighter - fast90][rm - light - fast45 ] ) .",
    "such rm differences have been observed in the fr  iis cygnys  a @xcite and 3c353 @xcite as well as in several fr  is ( e.g. 3c31 and hydraa , @xcite ; 3c449 , @xcite ; 0206 + 53 , 3c270 and m84 , @xcite ) .",
    "although we simulate rm enhancements caused by fr  ii radio sources , fr  is which are known to form icm x - ray cavities as well may well produce similar effects .",
    "hydraa is a well studied central cluster radio source .",
    "the faraday rotation in this case is thought to be dominated by the local icm contribution .",
    "this cluster presents an icm magnetic spectral index of which has been inferred against the emission from the embedded luminous fr  i radio source hydraa .",
    "the inclination angle of this source has been inferred to be @xcite .    in terms of rm statistical fluctuations",
    "that are asymmetrical between the source s lobes , we find that our `` lighter - faster '' simulation ( table  1 ) agrees to a certain degree with the studies of @xcite and @xcite on hydra  a. this is partly unexpected , as we have chosen a particular realisation for the magnetic power spectrum of the cmfs .",
    "however , we focus here on the edge effects , which is where we believe that radio sources have the strongest effect : two panels are shown in figure  [ fig : hydra ] where we present curves of @xmath24 ( left panel ) and @xmath25 ( right panel ) as a function of position along a horizontal line between the lobes .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the rm are taken on vertical slices of the map corresponding to the `` lighter - faster '' simulation at @xmath1745@xmath18 and @xmath194.7myr .",
    "vertical error bars are computed by taking the difference between the red and the black curves in figure  [ rm - lighter - relativistic45 ] .",
    "both statistical measures have large gradients near the left edge .",
    "this effect is produced by the expanding radio source . towards the right edge",
    ", the radio source expansion has also strongly amplified the rm values .",
    "however , the initial magnetic field in that region happened to be small , which is why this region does not look spectacular .",
    "this is quite comparable to the rm distribution in observed radio sources , e.g. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  22 , panels _ a _ and _ b _ ) who present the rm observations of hydra  a made by @xcite along with synthetic rm observation .",
    "it is therefore well possible that such large rm - gradients towards the edges of radio sources are strongly influenced by the lobe expansion .",
    "note that we consider here only one realisation for the random faraday screen .",
    "a detailed match of the considered rm gradient with any observation is therefore not intended .",
    "our model jets inject energy at scales that range from the resolution limit to the source size , but preferentially near the latter . as we have seen , this results in a flattening in both the magnetic power spectra and the rm structure functions at large - scales .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have reported such flat gradients in the observed structure functions of the fr  i sources 3c  31 , 3c270 , 3c  449 and hydraa .",
    "our simulations show that the physics of radio source expansion may explain these structure function gradients naturally .",
    "thus conclusions about the nature of the icm turbulence may not be drawn from the gradients in question .",
    "we have calculated the mean and the standard deviation of the rm for the approaching ( @xmath24@xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and the receding ( @xmath24@xmath28 and @xmath29 ) source lobes , as a function of the viewing angle . in the top left panel of figure  [ lobes ]",
    "we show @xmath24@xmath26 in solid lines and @xmath24@xmath28 in dashed lines . in all of these plots ,",
    "positive ( negative ) angles correspond to integrations along ( against ) the line of sight , and again jets are on the plane of the sky at . in the bottom left panel of figure  [ lobes ]",
    "we show @xmath30@xmath27 .",
    "in addition , to demonstrate the effect of the jets on the faraday screens , which will in turn affect the rm computations , we produce analogous ( @xmath24@xmath28 , @xmath24@xmath26 and @xmath30@xmath27 ) plots but use the data from the no - source rm maps ( section  [ rmmapsb ] ) .",
    "we show these no - source rm plots in the right column of figure  [ lobes ] , side by side to their source counterparts .",
    "together , all of these profiles show that the general dependence of the lobe rm statistics on the viewing angle is shaped by the intrinsic nature of the faraday screens , as it is generally assumed in the interpretation of the laing - garrington effect .",
    "the result of the radio source expansion is to amplify several rm features .    only for positive inclinations our realisation results in stronger average rms in the receding lobes ( figure  [ lobes ] , top panel ) .",
    "we see strong amplification at inclinations of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is linked to the depolarisation @xcite .",
    "already intrinsically , the depolarisation is always higher for the receding lobe ( @xmath30@xmath331 ) .",
    "panels in the bottom row ( figure  [ lobes ] ) show that this trend is mostly amplified by the radio sources , apart from the fatter ( lighter ) ones for which the @xmath34-ratio drops below unity near @xmath3590@xmath36 .",
    "thus the laing - garrington effect is only moderately affected by the radio source expansion , in such a way that the associated trends tend to be amplified .",
    "we have shown that powerful radio sources affect the structure of cmfs which is characterized by the magnetic power spectrum index  @xmath0 .",
    "this process is important because the icm energy transformation , either from or to magnetic form , as well as the observations @xcite , depend on @xmath0 .",
    "hence we agree with @xcite in that the structure of cmfs inferred by using the emission of cluster radio sources should take a piecewise defined form over the range of the spatial frequencies .",
    "our simulations show , moreover , that such functional forms change with time ( see figure  [ pow]a ,  b ; note that the profiles in panel _ b _ would be completely flat otherwise ) .",
    "faraday rotation measurements from clusters with broad differences in age will be key in the determination of evolving magnetic structure functions of the cmfs .",
    "we have presented a combination of 3d - mhd numerical simulations and synthetic rm observations to model the evolution and observational signatures of cluster magnetic fields under the effects of powerful agn jets at the core of a non - cool core galaxy cluster .",
    "we prescribe the cluster magnetic field as a gaussian random field with a power law energy spectrum tuned to resemble the expectations for turbulence .",
    "we focus on how both the jets power , in terms of their density and velocity , and the observational angle affect the observed rm signal .",
    "such signal is used by observational studies to infer the strength of cluster magnetic fields .",
    "our results are very consistent and show the following .",
    "powerful jets increase the icm energy in proportion to their velocity and in inverse proportion to their density .",
    "light jets are more efficient in this process because they inflate fatter cocoons than relatively heaver jets .",
    "only jets with mach numbers of  80 and  130 , which are over - pressured with respect to the ambient medium , significantly increase the icm magnetic energy .",
    "we see that the time evolution of the cmf energetics is correlated with that of the cocoon pressure .",
    "jets compress and displace the magnetised icm .",
    "this results in a flattening of the 3d magnetic power spectra and the associated field rm structure functions .",
    "this happens at scales from the resolution limit to the source size , but preferentially near the latter .",
    "we see the effect is correlated with the jet velocity and pronounced for fat cocoons .",
    "the rm structure functions of 3c  31 , 3c270 , 3c  449 and hydraa show flat gradients at large scales , and the cause of such shapes has been previously modeled @xcite in terms of icm turbulence",
    ". our model suggests , however , that the physics of radio source expansion may as well explain this feature .",
    "the general distribution of the faraday depth is determined by the intrinsic nature of the icm .",
    "powerful jets enhance the rm locally by factors up to  @xmath151.73 .",
    "we find this process is proportional to the jet velocity and in inversely proportional to the beam density .",
    "expanding hypersonic sources compress the icm gas and magnetic fields in the shocked ambient region . the strength of the fields that are perpendicular to the local lobe expansion direction increases , specially near the hotspots .",
    "the alignment of compressed cmf components and the line of sight is favoured ( i ) at the cocoon edge ( ii ) by sources with a fat cocoon ( iii ) at @xmath37 within 2070  degrees , due to the cocoon geometry .",
    "jet - produced rm enhancements are thus more important under these conditions and should be more evident in radio galaxies than in quasars .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath38 continuously change and tend to increase as the radio sources develop .",
    "`` lighter '' sources with jet velocities  @xmath3940mach yield @xmath40 and @xmath38 enhancement of factors within  1.2 to  1.7 , in proportion to the jet velocity .",
    "these rm enhancements may therefore lead to overestimations of the cmf strength by up to about 70% .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank robert laing and malcolm longair for useful discussions about this paper , as well as the anonymous referee for comments that helped to improve this work .",

    "<S> a combination of three - dimensional ( 3d ) magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) and synthetic numerical simulations are presented to follow the evolution of a randomly magnetised plasma that models the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , under the isolated effects of powerful , light , hypersonic and bipolar fanaroff - riley class  ii ( fr  ii ) jets . </S>",
    "<S> we prescribe the cluster magnetic field ( cmf ) as a gaussian random field with a kolmogorov - like energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> both the power of the jets and the viewing angle that is used for the synthetic rotation measure ( rm ) observations are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find the model radio sources introduce and amplify fluctuations on the rm statistical properties which we analyse as a function of time as well as the viewing angle . </S>",
    "<S> the average rm and the rm standard deviation are increased by the action of the jets . </S>",
    "<S> energetics , rm statistics and magnetic power spectral analysis consistently show that the effects also correlate with the jets power , and that the lightest , fastest jets produce the strongest changes in their environment . </S>",
    "<S> we see jets distort and amplify the cmfs especially near the edges of the lobes and the jets heads . </S>",
    "<S> this process leads to a flattening of the rm structure functions at scales comparable to the source size . </S>",
    "<S> the edge features we find are similar to ones observed in hydra  a. the results show that jet - produced rm enhancements are more apparent in quasars than in radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> globally , jets tend to enhance the rm standard deviation which may lead to overestimations of the cmfs strength by about 70% . </S>",
    "<S> this study means to serve as a pathfinder for the ska , evla and lofar to follow the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields .    </S>",
