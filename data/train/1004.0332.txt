    "the solutions to elliptic ( pseudo- ) differential equations on a manifold with edge are expected to be regular in weighted edge sobolev spaces with some typical asymptotic behaviour in the distance variable @xmath0 to the singularity ( we employ here the terminology from @xcite , see also @xcite ; later on we recall a few basic definitions ) .",
    "the simplest case of a manifold with edge is a manifold with smooth boundary .",
    "regularity of a ( shapiro - lopatinskij- ) elliptic boundary value problem in this situation ( say , for the laplacian , or any other elliptic operator @xmath1 implies smoothness of solutions up to the boundary when the boundary data and right hand sides are smooth . in particular , we obtain taylor asymptotics @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 in this case is the normal variable to the boundary , and the coefficients @xmath5 are smooth functions in the tangential variable @xmath6 also regularity in sobolev spaces up to the boundary can be formulated as an asymptotic result when we rephrase classical sobolev spaces as edge spaces , cf .",
    "@xcite , or remark [ 31locw ] below .",
    "however , the situation drastically changes when @xmath7 is an elliptic operator from the context of edge singularities .",
    "such an @xmath7 is locally in the variables @xmath8 of an open stretched wedge @xmath9 of edge - degenerate form @xmath10 @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a smooth ( compact , closed ) manifold and @xmath13 an open set , and @xmath14 is the space of differential operators of order @xmath15 over @xmath12 with smooth coefficients . according to @xcite , solutions @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( say , in @xmath18 under an ellipticity condition on @xmath19 are expected to have variable discrete asymptotics , i.e. @xmath20 modulo some flat remainder ( to be specified ) .",
    "the sequences @xmath21 are individual for every fixed @xmath22 they are determined by the operator @xmath19 and the right hand side of the equation @xmath17 where @xmath23 is assumed to be of analogous structure . for the coefficients we expect",
    "@xmath24 for every fixed @xmath6 what concerns sobolev smoothness in suitable scales of weighted edge spaces we even need the right framework to express such asymptotics .",
    "the present paper belongs to a larger program to investigate asymptotics of solutions in such a sense .",
    "we employ results of @xcite and @xcite for the case @xmath25 combined with the recent progress of the pseudo - differential analysis on ( non - trivial ) manifolds with edges .",
    "note that asymptotics of that kind have been studied also by bennish , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , using factorisations of the involved symbols .",
    "wiener - hopf techniques for ( pseudo - differential ) boundary value problems ( in general , without the transmission property at the boundary ) are developed in detail in the monograph of eskin @xcite . in concrete examples",
    "it may be very efficient to explicitly compute exponents as factorisation indices .",
    "our approach is completely different ; it is based on the idea of representing asymptotics in terms of analytic functionals , cf .",
    "the basics on the relationship between asymptotics and analytic functionals are already explained in @xcite , including crucial observations on variable and branching asymptotics in this set - up . a self - contained exposition on what we call continuous asymptotics is also given in @xcite .",
    "+ the idea to establish asymptotics of the form is to embed the problem into a pseudo - differential calculus and to interpret such asymptotics as a feature of the symbolic calculus .",
    "the difficulty is to incorporate the variety of different @xmath26 into spaces of symbols and also to design  the right \" weighted sobolev spaces with asymptotics , such that our operators are continuous between such spaces .",
    "we employ the pseudo - differential calculus on manifolds with edge in the sense of @xcite or @xcite which includes constant discrete or continuous asymptotics . here",
    ", we refer to a substructure of the edge algebra with continuous asymptotics .",
    "some basics have to be completely reorganised , for instance , the notion of green operators .",
    "the program is altogether extremely delicate since a pseudo - differential operator might destroy the very fragile pointwise discrete structure ; in fact , integration with respect to the edge variable @xmath27 smears out the system of exponents over a large region in the complex plane ( such phenomena are just the background of continuous asymptotics ) .",
    "however , we show that the operators in the edge calculus ( although very general in principle ) are so specific that they respect , indeed , the pointwise discrete character . + this paper is organised as follows .",
    "first in section 2.1 we give an idea on how elliptic edge - degenerate differential operators produce @xmath27-dependent families of meromorphic operator functions the poles of which contribute to the asymptotic data of solutions .",
    "the essential point is that we admit from the very beginning poles of non - constant multiplicity under varying @xmath6 in section 2.2 we rephrase the information with the help of families of analytic functionals in the complex plane of the mellin covariable , and we define the crucial notion of a variable discrete mellin asymptotic type and associated spaces of mellin amplitude functions . in section 2.3",
    "we study families of associated pseudo - differential operators , depending on @xmath28 the local variables and covariables on the edge . as such they play the role of specific operator - vaued symbols of the edge calculus with variable discrete asymptotics .",
    "other important ingredients are the green symbols with variable discrete asymptotics , studied in section 2.4 . here",
    "we also introduce variable discrete asymptotic types , belonging to families of functions over a cone .",
    "in particular , we show ( cf . proposition [ 22melgreen1 ] ) that various involved data ( such as the chosen cut - off functions , and several weights ) only change the mellin edge symbols by green symbols .",
    "another important issue is the nature of weighted edge distributions with variable discrete asymptotics , investigated in section 3.1 , including their frchet topology . finally in section 3.2",
    "we show that mellin and green operators of the edge calculus with variable discrete asymptotics act as continuous operators in weighted edge spaces with such asymptotics .",
    "this belongs to the idea to deduce variable discrete asymptotics of solutions to elliptic equations on a manifold with edge as an aspect of elliptic regularity in the edge calculus .",
    "it will be necessary to establish more elements of the edge calculus , e.g. the action of mellin operators with non - smoothing holomorphic amplitude functions , and the parametrix construction in this framework",
    ". this will be the topic of @xcite .",
    "let us first recall the idea on how solutions to an elliptic equation @xmath17 for @xmath29 acquire asymptotics .",
    "we employ the mellin transform @xmath30 which is known to induce a continuous operator @xmath31 here @xmath32 for an open set @xmath33 is the space of all holomorphic functions in @xmath34 ( in the frchet topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets ) .",
    "more precisely , setting @xmath35 for any real @xmath36 and @xmath37 we have a continuous operator @xmath38 that extends to an isomorphism @xmath39 for every @xmath40 we call @xmath41 the weighted mellin transform .",
    "recall that the inverse is given by the formula @xmath42 for @xmath43 in this paper a cut - off function on the half - axis is any real - valued @xmath44 that is equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of @xmath45 the mellin transform will be used also in the set - up of vector- and operator - valued functions .",
    "in particular , we employ mellin pseudo - differential operators with amplitude functions @xmath46 taking values in the space of classical pseudo - differential operators over @xmath12 of order @xmath47 let @xmath48 denote the space of classical parameter - dependent pseudo - differential operators on @xmath12 with parameter @xmath49 the local amplitude functions are classical symbols in @xmath50 , treated as a covariable , while the parameter - dependent smoothing operators are schwartz functions in @xmath51 with values in @xmath52 , the space of smoothing operators on x , with the frchet topology from an identification with @xmath53 via some riemannian metric . in the case",
