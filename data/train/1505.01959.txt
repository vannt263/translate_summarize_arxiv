    "<S> bilayer graphene ( blg ) with a tunable bandgap appears interesting as an alternative to graphene for practical applications , thus its transport properties are being actively pursued . using density functional theory and perturbation analysis , we investigated , under an external electric field , the electronic properties of blgs in various stackings relevant to recently observed complex structures . </S>",
    "<S> we established the first phase diagram summarizing the stacking - dependent gap openings of blgs for a given field . </S>",
    "<S> we further identified high - density midgap states , localized on grain boundaries , even under a strong field , which can considerably reduce overall transport gap .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of graphene has opened new avenues for studying the role of dimensionality on the fundamental properties of materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although graphene shows excellent electrical properties  @xcite , the zero bandgap of graphene limits its practical application as an electronic device . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> gap opening is possible in blg , thus making it a very promising material that overcomes graphene s key limitation while retaining many of its interesting properties . </S>",
    "<S> for example , massive dirac fermions in blg exhibit a bandgap tunable by applying a transverse electric field ( e - field )  @xcite ; this has been demonstrated by optical  @xcite and electrical transport measurements using dual - gated devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these measurements leave a couple of unsolved problems : 1 ) the origin of unexpectedly small transport gaps that are two orders of magnitude smaller than optical gaps  @xcite and 2 ) the origin of anomalous low - temperature ( @xmath0  2 k ) transport behaviors dominated by hopping between localized midgap states , presumably induced from disorders or defects  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have revealed complex configurations in blg , including various stacking domains induced by rotational faults and soliton formation  @xcite . while ab stacking is energetically most favorable , the non - ab - stacking region can be stabilized by a minute twist  @xcite and the stacking boundary  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the local stacking configuration is strongly coupled to its electronic structure and its response to an external e - field . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is critically important , fundamentally and practically , to understand the observed complex stackings and their impact on the overall electronic properties .    in this letter , using the framework of an effective hamiltonian based on density functional theory ( dft ) and perturbation theory , we analyze gap - opening properties of blgs near the high - symmetry stackings ( aa , aa@xmath1 , and ab ) , under an applied e - field . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a phase diagram for the stacking - dependent gap openings , and further identify grain boundaries containing non - ab stackings as a source for high - density midgap states even under a strong e - field . </S>",
    "<S> our findings offer insight to understanding the intrinsic transport properties of blgs .    </S>",
    "<S> our dft calculations adopt the perdew - burke - ernzerhof version of exchange - correlation functional  @xcite and the projector augmented wave method  @xcite for ionic potentials as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain interlayer distances between 3.25 ( ab ) and 3.45 ( aa ) with van der waals correction  @xcite ; interlayer distance of all the configurations is fixed at 3.35 ( unless specified ) with practically no changes in their band structures . to ensure an accurate bandgap , the 2d dft band structure near the @xmath2 point is interpolated  @xcite using maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> effective hamiltonians are constructed with the obtained hopping parameters truncated to the first nearest interlayer hoppings ( see details in supplemental materials ) .    , and ab . the solid lines are reflection planes , where the translation vectors ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) describe the relative displacement between the two layers in the @xmath5 plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) modeling of the two ab - stacking boundary . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) stacking - dependent potential energy of blg per unit cell , where the origin corresponds to aa stacking . </S>",
    "<S> a lattice wigner - seitz cell is highlighted by the solid white line , and the arrow denotes the displacement vector between the two ab - stacking domains shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) minimum energy path between the two ab stackings . ]    </S>",
    "<S> one of the intriguing properties of blg is that a change in weak interlayer interaction ( which is an order of magnitude smaller than the intralayer coupling strength ) accompanied by a modification in stacking configuration can significantly alter the electronic structure around the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](a ) illustrates schematic band structures of aa , aa@xmath1 , and ab stacking , where we define systems with equivalent two sublattices , such as aa and aa@xmath1 , as sublattice - symmetric systems ; otherwise , they are sublattice - asymmetric stackings ( such as ab ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1](b ) shows the atomistic modeling of an experimentally observed domain boundary  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , for visual clarity , we made the phase boundary region ( the region of continuous structural transition between two ab - stacking regions ) much smaller than the experimental ones . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1](c ) plots stacking - dependent potential energy with optimized interlayer distances in the 2d translation vector space , where ab stacking is used as a reference point . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow denotes the displacement vector between the left and right domains in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1](b ) </S>",
    "<S> . local stacking configurations of the transition region are distributed on this arrow . to remove this soliton - like boundary </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to displace the one on the left or right domain by a displacement vector . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum energy path between the two ab stackings lies along the edge of the hexagon with an energy barrier of 5.3 mev / cell ( see fig .  [ fig1](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> though this energy barrier seems quite small , the stacking domain should move as a whole so that the high energy barrier , which is proportional to the area of the domain ( @xmath6 unit cell ) , should be overcome . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the observed stability of non - ab stacking regions .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap - opening mechanism of blgs can be highly stacking dependent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we first examine the individual band structures near the high - symmetry stackings . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss the gap - opening properties across complex domain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> their effective hamiltonian in crystal momentum ( @xmath7 ) space can be described by a 4 @xmath8 4 matrix with the basis @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent sublattice indices and the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the upper and lower graphene layer , respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> , the 2 @xmath8 2 block - diagonal components correspond to the individual graphene layers while all others describe interlayer coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we will now focus only on the effective hamiltonian near the @xmath2 points ; band structures around @xmath17 can be obtained by applying time - reversal symmetry to those of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the configurations of aa stacking . neglecting small bloch phase variations under the fourier transformations of interlayer coupling , we find that the hamiltonian of aa stacking around @xmath2 becomes @xmath18 with @xmath19 defined as @xmath20 where the fermi velocity multiplied by the reduced planck constant becomes @xmath21 ev@xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 ( @xmath25  ev ) is obtained by the fourier transformation of the interlayer hopping between @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath26  @xcite . the hopping parameters between @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> become zero because the bloch phases of three interlayer nearest neighbors cancel each other at the @xmath2 point ; that is , @xmath27 .    by changing our basis to the bonding and antibonding state of each sublattice , </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling of two dirac cones becomes more transparent as follows : @xmath28 which is a block - diagonal hamiltonian describing two dirac cones with energy shift @xmath29 as shown in the schematic band diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) .    in the aa@xmath30-stacking configuration </S>",
    "<S> , one can also explicitly illustrate the decoupling of dirac cones by changing the basis to interlayer bonding and antibonding of phase - shifted sublattices [ @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of aa@xmath30 stacking then becomes @xmath32 where @xmath33  ev and @xmath34  ev , corresponding to two dirac cones separated by 0.22 ev in energy with an additional 0.08  @xmath35 splitting in @xmath7-space . </S>",
    "<S> wavefunctions of the decoupled dirac cones of both aa and aa@xmath30 stackings have interlayer antibonding and bonding characteristics , depicted respectively in red ( shaded ) and blue ( hatched ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) .        </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of ab staking can be written as @xmath36 that is , there are doubly degenerate states at the fermi level composed of one sublattice per layer , with no direct coupling between them . in this case </S>",
    "<S> two dirac points are merged at the @xmath2 point and split into bonding , antibonding , and nonbonding types ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we trace how a small translation or an external e - field can change the band structures , especially near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to treat small translations and e - fields as perturbations to the individual high - symmetry stackings .    </S>",
    "<S> the aa panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] summarizes projected ( onto @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) band structures for around - aa - stacked graphenes without and with an e - field . since interlayer hopping parameters ( @xmath26 and @xmath39 ) are the same , one can not generate an onsite energy difference in the 2 @xmath8 2 diagonal block simply by atomic translation , which excludes the direct coupling between two crossing bands ( _ i.e. _ , no gap opening ) . at the fermi level , </S>",
    "<S> the hole band of one dirac cone is degenerated along with the electron band of the other dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface of the aa stacking is the intersection of two vertically ( energetically ) shifted cones , a circle . a small translation results in a slight @xmath7-shift and a coupling of two dirac cones ; a @xmath7-shift changes the circular intersection into a tilted ellipse ( which is still a circle when projected on @xmath7-space ) , while a coupling introduces energy splitting at the intersection . in general , the energy splitting depends on the angular position of the intersection and becomes zero at two points . </S>",
    "<S> these form two crossing points near the fermi level as shown in the second row . </S>",
    "<S> an applied e - field introduces an additional energy splitting that also depends on the angular position and becomes zero at two points . </S>",
    "<S> when an e - field is combined with a sublattice - symmetric translation , their zero splitting points coincide and the system remains metallic . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , with the sublattice - asymmetric translation , each zero coupling points are at a different position and the crossing points disappear as shown in the inset in the fourth row . </S>",
    "<S> especially , when sublattice - asymmetric translation is applied toward ab stacking in the presence of a reflection and time - reversal symmetry , the minimum bandgaps occur along @xmath37 and are located exactly at the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the critical field for opening a gap is infinitesimally small . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbational results on the size of the bandgap are summarized in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , the fourth row in the aa block of fig . [ fig2 ] shows a small bandgap of @xmath4010 mev ( see the inset ) for an asymmetric translation of 0.3 and an e - field of 0.5 ev/.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    changes in band structures for around - aa@xmath30 stacking are well pronounced in the @xmath41 plane [ the blues lines in the second and fourth rows of the aa@xmath30 block in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ] . of the four bands in that plane , </S>",
    "<S> only different dirac cones can be coupled by a translation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , under sublattice - symmetric translation , only parallel - band pairs of each dirac cone are coupled , resulting in a balanced repulsion between them . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , under sublattice - asymmetric translation only non - parallel - band pairs of each cone are coupled , which induces an unfavorable crossing . </S>",
    "<S> also in this slice , e - field only couples parallel - band pairs for sublattice - symmetric translation . </S>",
    "<S> though the crossing point in a dirac cone does not open , each dirac cone s crossing band now has a small component of the opposite dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> if we apply an e - field with sublattice - symmetric stacking , crossing bands still remain crossed because in a dirac cone , one crossing band does not have a component parallel to the other crossing band . </S>",
    "<S> but if an e - field is applied to sublattice - asymmetric stacking , each crossing band now has a small component parallel to the other crossing bands , which opens a small bandgap . in spite of dirac cones opening </S>",
    "<S> , the energy level of each dirac point is different [ the fourth row in the aa@xmath30 block of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ] , thus a relatively strong e - field is required to change this pseudogap into a true gap .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we move on to the properties of around - ab stacking . </S>",
    "<S> as the stacking deviates from exact ab , the doubly degenerate states of ab at the @xmath2 point immediately split into two crossing points . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is demonstrated in the second and third columns of the ab block in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . from a symmetry viewpoint , the threefold rotational symmetry of monolayer graphene </S>",
    "<S> is recovered in aa- and ab - stacked blg . combined with translational symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , this imposes a threefold symmetry around the @xmath2 point . because two separated crossing points are not compatible with the symmetry , wavefunction symmetries change during the merging of two crossing points . </S>",
    "<S> it was reported that this merging process is very sensitive to miniscule translation ( @xmath400.01 ) and the band topology near the fermi level changes  @xcite . around ab stacking , </S>",
    "<S> an e - field opens a bandgap . </S>",
    "<S> especially , from the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , the bandgap is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 ev . </S>",
    "<S> all the perturbational results for the bandgap are summarized in table 1 .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) presents the stacking - dependent bandgap under a perpendicular e - field of 0.5 v/. a sizable bandgap opens only around the ab stacking while the rest still remains metallic . </S>",
    "<S> as e - field goes to zero , the metal - semiconductor phase boundary approaches the line connecting aa and ab stacking , and the entire region becomes metallic as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> though no bandgap opens by a pure translation , a minute bandgap ( @xmath07 mev ) was reported @xcite for a specific rotation angle without any e - field . to investigate the effect of the non - ab stacking region on the transport property </S>",
    "<S> , we constructed an atomic model of a stacking domain boundary with a transition length of 50 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> tight - binding parameters are assigned to each atom according to its local stacking configuration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when 0.5 ev of onsite energy difference between two layers is applied , which corresponds to 0.5 v/ of e - field , a bandgap opens at the ab stacking region while there remains finite density of states at the non - ab stacking region ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a high density of midgap states is localized along stacking boundaries even under a strong e - field . </S>",
    "<S> because the apparent transport gap is actually estimated from the activation energy of the carrier , a conduction through these midgap states can explain the small transport gap and the low - temperature hopping transport in dual - gated devices .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we theoretically investigated stacking - dependent gap - opening properties of symmetry - broken bilayer graphenes , and established a bandgap phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our findings may prove to be instrumental in developing graphene - based electronic devices . </S>"
