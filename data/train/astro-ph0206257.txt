    "of primary interest is the dependence of mass - loss rates for luminous ob stars on @xmath5 .",
    "theoretically , the strength of radiatively driven o - star winds is predicted to depend on metallicity , @xmath5 , as @xmath6 ( kudritzki , pauldrach & puls 1987 ; vink , de koter & lamers 2001 ) .",
    "observationally , the principal method of deriving mass - loss properties of o stars has been via radio observations for stars within a few kpc , or h@xmath0 observations more generally ( puls et al . 1996 ) .",
    "_ fuse _ revives the possibility of using uv resonance lines to determine mass - loss rates empirically .",
    "observational results from h@xmath0 have been combined with theoretical predictions to generate the so - called wind - momentum - luminosity relationship ( wlr ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ) , which can be used to determine extragalactic distances . to date , such studies almost exclusively employed plane - parallel , non - lte models for determinations of temperature ( using photospheric he lines ) , and separately use wind models to determine mass - loss rates ( using h@xmath0 or uv wind profiles ) .",
    "recent examples of the latter approach include pauldrach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and pauldrach , hoffman & lennon ( 2001 ) . clearly , the underlying assumption in such studies is that the effects of winds on photospheric optical lines is negligible  see , however , gabler et al .",

    "recently , fullerton et al . ( 2000 ; hereafter paper  i ) presented a study of azv232 ( o7iaf@xmath7 , smc ) and sk-67@xmath8 111 ( o6ia(n)fp var , lmc ) based on _ fuse _ spectroscopy .",

    "in contrast , recent non - lte , plane - parallel , hydrostatic studies of azv232 ( e.g. puls et al . 1996 ) , derived a substantially higher stellar temperature of @xmath938kk from optical photospheric lines .",
    "this represents an important discrepancy with respect to derived bolometric luminosities ( @xmath10 ) , and so indirectly affects the calibration of the wlr .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the properties of a small sample of extreme ob supergiants in the magellanic clouds to verify whether the supergiants studied in paper  i are typical , and if so , how these discrepancies may be resolved .",
    "these stars were selected to cover a wide range of spectral types , with the additional criteria that ( i ) they should have low interstellar h@xmath11 column densities to minimize contamination in the _ fuse _ region ; and ( ii ) they should have small projected rotational velocities .",
    "we supplement the _ fuse _ spectroscopy with _ iue _ and _ hst _ uv spectroscopy , together with ground - based optical observations in order to help resolve previously conflicting determinations of stellar temperature and mass - loss rate . to date , uv studies of ob stars generally adopt temperatures from optical plane - parallel analyses ( e.g. haser et al . 1998 ) .",

    "before we discuss results for our program stars allowing for the presence of stellar winds , we first follow the usual method of determining stellar temperatures , surface gravities and helium abundances , namely via the standard plane - parallel , hydrostatic methods as employed by herrero et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and smith & howarth ( 1994 ) .",
    "a large grid of hydrostatic , plane - parallel model atmospheres calculated with tlusty ( hubeny & lanz 1998 ) were used , involving @xmath22 , @xmath23 and he / h , as follows .",
    "parameters are found by mapping the locus of models that reproduce the measured equivalent widths in the ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) plane for each optical helium line .",
    "the heii lines are strongly sensitive to temperature for o stars and @xmath24200 , 4541 are used as the primary temperature diagnostics ( heii @xmath44686 is not considered due to the wind effects for this line ) . following smith & howarth ( 1998 ) , a microturbulence of @xmath24 = 15 kms@xmath18 is adopted for this part of the analysis .",
    "values in the range 1020 kms@xmath18 are considered for our subsequent analysis based on extended , line - blanketed model atmospheres (   [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath23 from balmer line wings is challenging for stars with such strong winds , since h@xmath25 is strongly blended with niii @xmath44097 and siiv @xmath240884116 , and h@xmath26 show emission in their red wings .",
    "consequently , the values derived here are from h@xmath27 and h8 . the wings of the lines are compared with the grid of model spectra and a @xmath28 value is found for each model and then the locus of minima is mapped in the ( @xmath29 ) plane .    prior to balmer line fitting , a measure of the macroscopic broadening of the lines is required to convolve with the models before comparison with observations . as in herrero et al .",
    "( 1992 ) the projected rotational velocity @xmath30 is found using the hei lines . a model spectrum that reproduces the observed helium equivalent widths",
    "is interpolated from the grid , mapped onto the observations and then the broadening of the convolved model for which @xmath28 is a minimum is taken as @xmath30 .",
    "stellar parameters are selected from the ( @xmath29 ) fit diagram ( e.g. smith & howarth 1998 ) . ideally , the single point where the loci intersect gives the parameters for the model spectrum that best describes the star .",
    "a model spectrum is then calculated with those parameters .",
    "comparison of the model with the observations permits a qualitative `` by - eye '' inspection of the line fits and small changes of order @xmath31 = 1kk or @xmath32 = 0.1 are made if the overall quality of the fits is improved .",
    "the strongest weight was given to @xmath44388 and @xmath44922 for hei lines ( not available for hde269698 ) .    in principle",
    "the helium abundance is determined by choosing the fit diagram with the smallest intersection region in the ( @xmath29 ) plane for differing values of he / h . however , no obvious improvement over the fits at solar abundance was revealed .",
    "initial values at solar abundance were taken from the fit diagrams and then if a consistent model fit could not be obtained higher values were investigated .",
    "if the new model gave more a consistent fit that value was adopted .      as an example of the fit quality achieved , we present tlusty model fits to uves optical observations of hde269698 in fig.[hde269698_tlusty ] . clearly , hei - ii ( photospheric ) absorption lines are well reproduced , in contrast with ( wind ) emission at heii @xmath44686 .",
    "h@xmath0 is totally dominated by wind emission , whilst other members of the balmer series , up to and including h@xmath27 , also suffer from wind contamination .",
    "consequently , a firm determination of he / h is extremely difficult for such extreme o supergiants .",
    "surface gravities rely principally on the blue wings of balmer - series members .",
    "as discussed elsewhere ( e.g. puls et al . 1996 ) , the neglect of wind contamination systematically underestimates the true surface gravity by @xmath140.050.1 dex .",
    "spectroscopic results are presented in table  [ t3 ] for our program stars , including previous results by puls et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for hde269698 and azv232 .",
    "overall , previous hydrostatic results are supported by our tlusty studies , except that a somewhat higher @xmath22=31kk is derived for sk@xmath12 than @xmath22=28kk obtained by lennon et al .",
    "fig .  [ hde269698_tlusty ] illustrates the successes and failures of plane - parallel techniques .",
    "photospheric profiles in ob stars can be readily matched allowing determination of physical parameters , yet in many non - dwarf o stars , wind contamination prevents robust results .",
    "such techniques , including those presented above , generally neglect the effect of metal line blanketing ( see , however , hubeny et al .",
    "this has importance for the ionization structure .",
    "therefore , we have additionally calculated spherically extended models which explicitly allow for line blanketing , in order to better constrain the fundamental properties of ob supergiants .      several model atmosphere codes are now available for modeling the photospheres and stellar winds of early - type stars without making the traditional core - halo approximation ( see crowther 1999 for a summary ) .",
    "we have carried out test calculations using isa - wind ( de koter , schmutz & lamers 1993 ; de koter , heap & hubeny 1997 ) , cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) and wm - basic ( pauldrach et al .",
    "2001 ) , for which a reasonable degree of consistency in the emergent fuv and uv spectra and wind ionization structure was obtained .",
    "calculations carried out at our request for @xmath33 pup with the potsdam code ( grfener et al .",
    "2002 ) also show remarkably good consistency .",
    "for the present application , our requirements include the need to study wind and photospheric features simultaneously , and to consider line blanketing .",
    "we have therefore selected cmfgen , given that : ( i ) wm - basic does not yet properly account for stark broadening in optical photospheric lines , despite its extremely thorough ( albeit approximate ) treatment of line blanketing and shocks ; ( ii ) the sobolev assumption which makes isa - wind so computationally quick , also hinders its usefulness for realistic photospheric modeling of ob - type stars .",
    "although the stellar photosphere and the highly supersonic wind are accurately parameterized by this code , the interface between these two regimes is poorly represented by the sobolev approximation .",
    "cmfgen solves the equations of statistical equilibrium , radiative transfer and radiative equilibrium , and incorporates line blanketing directly through use of a super - level approach ( hillier & miller 1998 ) .",
    "the ions included in our calculations are presented in table  [ table0 ] .",
    "we construct two different model atoms : one appropriate for early o supergiants , the other for late o supergiants .",
    "the input atmospheric structure , connecting the spherically extended hydrostatic layers to the @xmath34-law wind , is achieved via a parameterized scale height , @xmath35 .",
    "this is defined relative to the surface gravity of the star in hillier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , via : @xmath36 where @xmath19 is the mean number of electrons per ion , @xmath37 is the mean ionic mass , @xmath38 is the ratio of radiation pressure to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the local electron temperature in kelvin .",
    "we initially adopt @xmath41 , which is subsequently revised based on fits to the wings of hei and balmer lines . at high rosseland optical depth , the parameterized form of our velocity law",
    "may be replaced with the equivalent plane - parallel hydrostatic structure obtained from tlusty ( hillier et al .",
    "2002 ) . for the present application this option is not utilized , since the program o supergiants all possess extremely extended atmospheres , such that use of hydrostatic models , even at depth is questionable .",
    "comparisons between tlusty and cmfgen have been undertaken in the case of very low mass - loss rates by hillier & lanz ( 2001 ) and were found to be fully consistent in the case of negligible spherical extension .",
    "the formal solution of the radiative - transfer equation to obtain the final emergent spectrum is computed separately , and includes standard stark broadening tables for hi , hei - ii . except where noted , these calculations assume a radially dependent ` microturbulence ' of the form used by haser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , with @xmath42=10 kms@xmath18 at the base of the wind and @xmath43=100 kms@xmath18 at @xmath44 .",
    "haser et al . ( 1998 ) and hillier et al . (",
    "2002 ) discuss the effect of varying @xmath24 in o - star models .",
    "it has been established that high ionization stage resonance lines , most notably ovi @xmath2103238 and nv @xmath2123842 , can only be reproduced in most o stars by considering x - rays ( e.g. pauldrach et al .",
    "1994 , 2001 ; haser et al .",
    "x - rays are thought to originate in o star winds via the intrinsic instability of radiatively driven winds ( e.g. owocki , castor & rybicki 1988 ; feldmeier 1995 ) , and affect high ions via auger - ionization ( cassinelli & olson 1979 )",
    ". however , macfarlane et al . (",
    "1993 ) demonstrated for @xmath33 pup that it is _ solely _ these ion fractions throughout the wind that are sensitive to the x - ray flux .",
    "consequently , the inclusion or exclusion of x - rays is generally not relevant to the determination of fundamental stellar parameters and abundances .",
    "further , fitting ovi and nv requires several parameters to be varied , including shock temperature , emissivity , x - ray luminosity , all of which are _ a priori _ unknown , and some of which are likely degenerate .",
    "therefore , we have chosen against attempts to _ derive _ shock parameters for the program stars , but instead _ adopt _ a uniform set of x - ray properties for all final model calculations .",
    "we use a rather soft two component raymond & smith ( 1977 ) x - ray spectrum , with 3@xmath45k and 5@xmath45kk , respectively .",
    "we scale their volume filling factors to ensure @xmath46 .",
    "this is towards the high end of observed values for o stars ( chlebowski , harnden & sciortino 1989 ) , but as we shall demonstrate below , it should be stressed that the bolometric luminosities of o supergiants previously derived may have been overestimated through inadequate temperature determinations .",
    "two further assumptions are that the filling factor of the 5 million kelvin component is fixed at a factor of two smaller than the 3 million kelvin component .      for individual stars ,",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "we adjust the stellar temperature and mass - loss rate of an individual model until the ` photospheric ' heii @xmath44542 and hei @xmath44471 lines are matched , and simultaneously , we vary the total mass - loss rate until the _ shape _ of h@xmath0 is also reproduced . if necessary , we adjust the exponent of the @xmath34-law until h@xmath0 is better reproduced ( see e.g. fig .",
    "15 in prinja et al . 2001 ) . for the present sample 1 @xmath47 2 , with a typical accuracy of @xmath480.2 .",
    "[ mdot ] illustrates this approach for hde269698 , via a series of identical models except for increasing mass - loss rate .",
    "note that some features are very sensitive to mass - loss rate ( h@xmath0 , heii ) , some are modestly affected ( hei @xmath44471 , niv @xmath44058 ) , whilst others are rather insensitive ( niii @xmath2463441 ) .",
    "this figure also illustrates that , increasing the mass - loss rate , with all other parameters held fixed , the ratio of the _ photospheric _ o - star classification lines , heii @xmath44542 and hei @xmath44471 , changes significantly .",
    "this implies that an o supergiant with a _",
    "strong _ stellar wind may possess a _",
    "lower _ stellar temperature than an o dwarf of identical spectral type .",
    "the usual assumption that stellar winds do not affect optical photospheric lines is invalidated for such stars , as previously suggested by , e.g. , schaerer & schmutz ( 1994 ) .",
    "further , line blanketing affects the ionization balance of helium via backwarming , such that the effect is two - fold relative to h - he plane - parallel , hydrostatic models .",
    "martins , schaerer & hillier ( 2002 ) demonstrate the considerable effect of including line blanketing for o dwarfs .",
    "fortunately , the central absorption strength in our primary diagnostic lines is rather insensitive to adopted atmospheric scale height , as discussed in detail by hillier et al .",
    "the scale height is varied in the final stages of the analysis to ensure good consistency with observed wings of balmer and hei lines .",
    "the helium content is held fixed at he / h=0.2 by number , since this is typical of other extreme o supergiants ( e.g. crowther & bohannan 1997 ) .",
    "the weak dependence of , e.g. , hei @xmath44471 and heii @xmath44542 on changes in he / h , and subtle dependence on temperature , atmospheric scale height and microturbulence ( smith & howarth 1998 ) , means that this ratio is exceptionally difficult to measure in practice .",
    "as we shall show , all program o supergiants are at least partially cno processed , so some level of he enrichment is expected .",
    "fortunately , the exact he content of individual stars is not crucial to the fundamental temperature scale of o supergiants which we are primarily concerned with here . for 0.1@xmath49he / h@xmath490.4 ,",
    "the potential uncertainty introduced into mass - loss rate determinations is at most @xmath1430% , unless clumping plays a role ( see   [ clumping ] ) .",
    "other elemental abundances are initially fixed at 0.4@xmath50 ( lmc ) or 0.2@xmath50 ( smc ) as determined from oxygen abundances in these galaxies ( dufour 1984 ; russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "subsequently , cno abundances are varied in order to better match ultraviolet and optical metal lines .",
    "hde269698 was one of two lmc o supergiants included in the study of haser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who obtained 0.50.8@xmath50 from model fits to _ hst_-fos spectroscopy .",
    "abundance changes in non - cno elements ( e.g. s , fe ) would lead to somewhat improved fits , but this was not attempted since it was not central to the primary goal of this work .",
    "our only exception to this is for phosphorus , since this is of relevance to the question of clumping in o stars ( see   [ clumping ] ) .    at each step in the iterative process",
    "we ensure that the predicted flux distribution matches the de - reddened energy distribution .",

    "our results broadly support previous investigations , namely ( substantial ) nitrogen enrichment , plus ( modest ) carbon depletion , i.e. reveal n / c@xmath143 ( sk@xmath12 ) , 10 ( hde270952 , azv232 ) or 30 ( hde269698 ) , by number .",
    "unfortunately , venn ( 1999 ) was only able to derive an upper limit to the carbon abundance in her study of smc a supergiants , such that n / c@xmath831 .",
    "nevertheless , she also supported a general nitrogen enrichment , of between 0.2 and @xmath831.2 dex .",
    "how do such abundance ratios compare with theoretical expectations for post - main sequence massive stars ?",
    "a major deficiency with the previous generation of evolutionary models for massive stars was that he and n enrichments for ob stars were not predicted until much later stages of evolution ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) . in contrast , recent models accounting for rotational mixing do predict n / c ratios which are much higher than the initial ( solar ) n / c ratio of @xmath140.2 by number . for example ,",
    "meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) discuss the evolution of an initial 60 @xmath63 star at ( solar ) metallicity , initially rotating at 300  kms@xmath18 .",
    "rotational mixing permits changes to the surface n / c ratio , i.e. n / c=6 during the o - supergiant phase , when he / h=0.2 , and subsequently n / c=12 when he / h=0.25 ( meynet , priv . comm . ) .",
    "in general , our results indicate moderate carbon and oxygen depletions relative to lmc / smc hii regions , with nitrogen substantially enriched .",
    "if we were to assume that we are solely witnessing cno - processed material at the surface , one would expect carbon ( and oxygen ) depletions which are substantially greater to produce the necessary nitrogen enrichment , since the total cno abundance is maintained within the cno - cycle .",
    "indeed , the problem is potentially even more acute , since up until now we have adopted nominal lmc ( smc ) cno abundances which are scaled to 0.4 ( 0.2 ) @xmath84 , where @xmath84 refers to the solar metallicity of a particular element . in reality , the magellanic cloud nitrogen abundance from which these stars recently formed is considered to be much more depleted , with @xmath140.1@xmath84 in the lmc ( garnett 1999 ; korn et al .",
    "2002 ) , and 0.03@xmath84 in the smc ( peimbert , peimbert & ruiz 2000 ) .",
    "the apparent problem is best illustrated for azv232  in the smc for which carbon is only a factor of two depleted relative to typical smc values ( garnett et al .",
    "1995 ) , whilst nitrogen is a factor of one hundred times higher than normal smc values .",
    "oxygen can not easily remedy this situation , since the cn cycle precedes the on cycle .",
    "besides , it suffers a similar depletion to carbon ( peimbert et al .",
    "similarly , taking hde270952  as representative of the lmc stars , discrepancies are somewhat similar : carbon and oxygen are again only a factor of two depleted relative to hii regions or b stars , whilst nitrogen is a factor of 50 times higher than lmc values ( garnett 1999 ; korn et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "how can we resolve this puzzle ?",
    "a likely solution is that we are witnessing evidence of mixing .",
    "the surface abundances are not solely exhibiting products of cno processing , but instead a mixture of initial abundances , plus cno processed material . in this case we would expect strong n enrichment , which is observed , but ( assuming , say , 50% initial abundances ) a reduction in c by no greater than a factor of two , which we also observe . in principal , one could get an estimate of the amount of mixing that has occured .",
    "detailed comparisons with evolutionary models accounting for rotation await appropriate calculations for low - metallicity environments .",
    "one might question the high nitrogen abundance in azv232   as determined by cmfgen , but niii @xmath44097 appears to be a very sensitive abundance indicator .",
    "indeed , the optical niii spectral morphology of azv232is remarkably similar to galactic counterparts such as hd163758 ( o6.5iaf ) , suggesting similar present - day n abundances , despite very different initial abundances .",
    "observations universally point to the structured nature of ob winds , via uv ( e.g. massa et al . 1995 ) and optical spectroscopic monitoring campaigns ( e.g. eversberg , lepine & moffat 1998 ) , and mm / radio imaging ( e.g. blomme et al . 2002 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic models also indicate that their winds are clumped and time variable ( e.g. owocki et al .",
    "1988 ) . for wolf - rayet stars ,",
    "all stellar lines are formed in the clumped wind whilst the situation for o - type stars is less clear , with clumping originating above the stellar surface  perhaps above the formation region of the usual diagnostic lines .",
    "it is apparent that shocked , clumpy , models _ are _ required to match the ovi doublet in our program stars , plus nv in some cases .",
    "precise shock parameters can not yet be derived uniquely from optical and uv spectra . nevertheless , it is possible that clumping may also affect some of our adopted wind diagnostics of o stars .",
    "if so , we may use this fact to investigate the degree of clumping for the inner wind of o stars .",
    "we have calculated a model of azv232 identical to that discussed above , except that its volume filling factor is reduced from 100% to 10% , and mass - loss rate reduced to 2@xmath62 @xmath63 yr@xmath18 .",
    "overall , we find very few differences from the smooth model .",
    "the o supergiant case is in stark contrast with wolf - rayet stars for which electron scattering wings provide very important probes of clumping ( hillier 1991 ; schmutz 1997 ) .",
    "one potentially useful diagnostic is the pv @xmath21118 - 28 doublet for which the non - clumped model overpredicts both absorption and emission for hde269698 , hde270952 and azv232 ( see also massa et al . 2002 ) .",
    "p@xmath85 is the dominant phosphorus ion throughout most of the wind of azv232 ( if @xmath86 32kk ) , so that the clumped model reveals weaker profiles , in better agreement with observation - see fig .",
    "[ av232_pv ] .",

    "the reverse is true , especially at the earliest subtypes .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that vacca et al .",

    "consequently , @xmath33 pup ( o4i(n)f ) was included in their calibration with @xmath22(no wind blanketing)=46.5kk , rather than @xmath22(wind blanketing)=42kk ( bohannan et al .",
    "1986 ) , although the ` core - halo ' approach was followed in their study .",
    "test calculations carried out for @xmath33 pup , which consistently include sphericity _ and _ line blanketing , indicate @xmath89kk , illustrating the additional effect that line blanketing plays .",

    "stellar temperature determinations of o supergiants undertaken during the past decade are summarised in table  [ t6 ] , sorted by the degree of complexity implemented ; i.e. , plane - parallel versus spherical , plus unblanketed versus line blanketed . from table",

    "et al . ( 1997 ) successfully combining optical / uv / fuv diagnostics .",
    "a critical revision to the temperature calibration of o supergiants clearly requires analysis of a substantially larger sample of targets , using the methods outlined here , which is currently underway .",
    "revisions do not necessarily possess a strong metallicity dependence , since azv232 ( smc ) possesses a similar difference from standard calibrations to the three lmc stars studied here ( fig .",

    "independent observational evidence in favour of ( 12kk ) lower temperatures of o dwarfs may be drawn from studies of o - type binaries ( e.g. harries , hilditch & hill 1998 ) . the rarity of o supergiants within short - period eclipsing binary systems prevents direct determinations of radii , and thus temperatures , for o supergiants . the greater effect identified here for extreme o supergiants",
    "may reasonably be attributable to the effect of strong winds on the photospheric lines .",
    "our results argue for a substantial revision in stellar parameters for o supergiants versus those derived from previous spectroscopic techniques . for hde269698 ,",
    "the reduction in temperature implies a decrease in luminosity from @xmath141.6@xmath90 to 1.0@xmath90 .",
    "such changes greatly affect the number of lyman - ionizing photons emitted  in the case of hde269698 , the standard @xmath22-calibration would imply that its lyman - ionizing output is a factor of two higher than the 10@xmath91 phs@xmath18 determined here .",
    "the ionizing flux of hde269698 below the hei @xmath4504 edge is reduced by a factor of three to 10@xmath92 phs@xmath18 .",
    "similar changes are obtained for the other program stars .",
    "fortunately , comparisons of nebular strengths in young , massive clusters with their constituent o stars are generally weighted towards main - sequence populations .",
    "nevertheless , cases exist where individual o stars dominate hii regions ( e.g. oey et al . 2000 ) which would be dramatically affected by such large temperature changes .",
    "masses are more difficult to constrain , but the decrease in the spectroscopic luminosity and gravity also cause large differences from previous determinations . consequently , evolutionary model comparisons with o supergiants carried out previously may not have been using the appropriate tracks in many cases .",
    "although initial ( and indeed current ) rotational velocities for the program stars are not known , adopting @xmath93=300 kms@xmath18 suggest an _ initial _ mass of 75@xmath63 for hde269698 according to evolutionary models ( fig .",
    "8 of meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , an initial mass in excess of 120@xmath63 would be implied by models on the basis of its previously determined higher luminosity .",
    "our results do not solve the long - standing ` mass discrepancy ' for o stars ( herrero et al .",
    "1992 ) between evolutionary and spectroscopic mass determinations , since the reduction in spectroscopic luminosity is also accompanied by a reduced mass .",
    "again , using hde269698 as an example , the reduction in spectroscopic gravity from @xmath943.7 to @xmath953.35 implies a decrease from @xmath96 to @xmath97 in its _ current _ mass .",
    "the revision in luminosity also implies a different mass - loss rate .",
    "table  [ t4 ] shows a 35% reduction in @xmath1 for hde269698 ( without accounting for the possibility that the wind is clumped ) .",
    "this revision affects the kinetic energy injected by individual stars or a young , massive cluster to the ism , since this is more dependent on the o supergiants and wr properties than on the main sequence stars ( e.g. crowther & dessart 1998 ) .",
    "these effects have major consequences for the wind - momentum - luminosity relationship ( wlr ) . in fig .  [ momentum ]",

    "<S> hei - ii photospheric lines reveal stellar temperatures which are systematically ( 57.5kk ) and substantially ( 1520% ) lower than previously derived from unblanketed , plane - parallel , non - lte photospheric studies . </S>",
    "<S> we have confidence in these revisions , since derived temperatures generally yield consistent fits across the entire @xmath29127000  observed spectral range . </S>",

    "<S> ` of ' classification criteria are directly linked to ( strong ) nitrogen enrichment ( via niii @xmath44097 ) and ( weak ) carbon depletion ( via ciii @xmath24647 - 51 ) , providing evidence for mixing of unprocessed and cno processed material at their stellar surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> oxygen abundances are more difficult to constrain , except via oii lines in the o9.7 supergiant for which it is also found to be somewhat depleted . unfortunately , he / h is very difficult to determine in individual o supergiants , due to uncertainties in microturbulence and the atmospheric scale height . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of wind clumping is also investigated , for which pv @xmath2111828 potentially provides a useful diagnostic in o - star winds , unless phosphorus can be independently demonstrated to be underabundant relative to other heavy elements . </S>",
    "<S> revised stellar properties affect existing calibrations of ( i ) lyman continuum photons  a factor of two lower for the o4 supergiant ; and ( ii ) kinetic energy released into the ism by o supergiants . </S>",
    "<S> our results also have importance for the calibration of the wind momentum - luminosity relationship for ob stars , particularly since the stars studied here are amongst the visually brightest ob stars in external galaxies . </S>"
