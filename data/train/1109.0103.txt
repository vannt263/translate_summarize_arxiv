    "spontaneous emission of a dipole emitter can be altered by the presence of a metallic or dielectric reflector .",
    "for instance , the spontaneous emission may be completely inhibited inside an appropriately designed optical cavity .",
    "purcell provided the first quantitative analysis on the emission dynamics of an atomic dipole placed inside a cavity characterized by its quality factor ( @xmath1 ) and mode volume ( @xmath2).@xcite it has been now well established that the effect of the spontaneous emission modification will be more pronounced with the higher @xmath3 ratio.@xcite    on the other hand , researchers in the field of semiconductor lasers have searched various ways to achieve the so - called ` thresholdless ' laser in the context of spontaneous emission control by some form of high @xmath3 cavities.@xcite the concept of photonic - crystal ( phc)@xcite has revolutionized the development of such high @xmath3 lasers , enabling further miniaturization in device size and reduction in threshold power .",
    "the periodic arrangement of dielectrics can result in a forbidden frequency region within which any electromagnetic mode can not propagate , a property now called the ` photonic band gap ( pbg).'@xcite in fact , the presence of such an energy band gap in a one - dimensional ( 1-d ) periodic structure ( distributed bragg reflector , dbr)@xcite has been known for some time and already applied to the design of the vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel).@xcite the artificial material possessing pbg enables us to confine electromagnetic energy in a volume smaller than the associated wavelength of light .",
    "the first nanocavity laser was achieved based on a thin dielectric membrane with periodically arranged air - holes in two - dimensions.@xcite laser gain was provided by multiple layers of quantum wells embedded in the middle of the slab .",
    "though @xmath1 of the initial laser cavity was below 500 , much progress has been made toward higher @xmath1 and smaller @xmath2 and this has been a major research topic until very recently.@xcite however , the importance of out - coupling efficiency in these wavelength - scale emitters has for some time been neglected .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the basic architecture of phc nanocavity design has not changed much since the original air - suspended thin - slab geometry.@xcite the use of such a thin slab appears to be indispensable to maximize the size of the in - plane pbg.@xcite for a high refractive index semiconductor slab , a typical thickness of the phc slab is 0.5 @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the lattice constant . yet in reality , most phc slab nanocavities are suspended over a dielectric ( or metallic ) substrate , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . thus , they are no longer isolated but experience feedback from their environment .",
    "it has been pointed out that even cavities with @xmath1 in the range of 50,000 can ` see ' the underlying mirror surface , leading to severe modification in the far - field radiation profile.@xcite this phenomenon , as is to be discussed in the following section , has a strong analogy to the aforementioned cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) example of the point dipole source near a plane mirror.@xcite we will show that the combination of a highly reflective bottom mirror and a proper gap size between the phc slab and the mirror can lead to enhanced far - field directionality from the phc cavity by more than a factor of 6 in comparison with the phc nanocavity in the absence of the bottom reflector .",
    "this result should be of practical importance for the various phc based light emitters including nanolasers and single - photon sources.@xcite     evolution of photonic crystal nanolaser : from vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser to hybrid metal - photonic crystal laser.,width=453 ]    recently , the realization of an _ electrically - pumped _",
    "nanolaser has drawn renewed attention of many researchers .",
    "the first current injection phc nanolaser was demonstrated in 2004 , in which a submicron - sized dielectric post was introduced right below the laser cavity as a means to deliver and confine electrical current.@xcite however , in order to obtain reasonably high @xmath1 for lasing , the post structure needs to be made very thin ( diameter @xmath5 500 nm ) and long ( typically @xmath6 ) .",
    "this could lead to unusually high electrical resistance of over @xmath7 , which has been a major bottleneck to achieve continuous - wave ( cw ) operation of a laser at room - temperature ( rt ) . to circumvent this issues ,",
    "laterally - doped _",
    "p - i - n _ structures were proposed recently.@xcite cw lasing has been achieved by external cooling at an ambient temperature of @xmath8 150 k.@xcite note that _ optically - pumped _ rt - cw lasing operation of a phc nanolaser was already demonstrated by nozaki , _",
    "et al._,@xcite however , realization of its electrical counterpart has been a severe challenge .",
    "therefore , we believe now is the time to reconsider the phc slab design itself . the concept of using a bottom mirror can naturally lead to the following question  what would happen if we make the air - gap size zero by placing the whole phc slab directly on the mirror ?",
    "we show that a flat metal substrate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( d ) ) can be used effectively to achieve good vertical confinement of the cavity mode.@xcite furthermore , metals are very good conductors for both electrical current and heat dissipation .",
    "this may imply that the aforementioned difficulties in building current - injection phc nanolasers could be mitigated using this hybrid metal - phc slab design .",
    "we shall provide numerical simulation results on the metal - bonded phc nanocavities in sec .  [",
    "sec : on_metal ] .",
    "since the phc structure is now in contact with the metal substrate , we can expect certain ` plasmonic ' effects in this hybrid design .",
    "in fact , it may not be easy to distinguish between ` photonic ' and ` plasmonic ' when both characters coexist in the same structure .",
    "therefore , we will discuss the relationship of this newly proposed design to various ` plasmonic ' cavities .",
    "we will propose a quantitative measure of the degree of the ` plasmonic ' character , ` _ plasmonicity _ ' , which would provide a useful guideline in the design of ` plasmonic ' cavities .",

    "drude model parameters are as follows ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "( e ) the resonance frequency also changes as we vary the air - gap size.,width=491 ]    before going into the details of the hybrid metal - phc nanocavity , let us first consider a phc nanocavity suspended over a flat mirror as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the situation is directly analogous to a point dipole emitter near a plane mirror , which is a well - known cavity qed example.@xcite certainly , there are differences between the phc nanocavity and the dipole emitter .",
    "the phc nanocavity is much bigger in size than the atomic dipole emitter .",
    "the radiation pattern from this hypothetical emitter does not resemble to that of the simple dipole emitter .",
    "in general , the complete description requires higher - order multipoles including both electric- and magnetic - multipoles.@xcite thus , we can view this generalized light emitter as a sum of point - like multipole emitters .",
    "similar modifications in the decay rate and the radiation pattern from the phc nanocavity are expected . in the absence of a bottom mirror , we find that @xmath23 of the deformed hexapole mode ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](b ) ) is @xmath8 15,000 ( subscript @xmath24 for the cavity with no bottom reflector).@xcite to make our analysis more analogous to@xcite , we translate @xmath23 into the radiative decay rate using the relation @xmath25 .",
    "we have performed 3-d finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations to study how @xmath9 changes in the presence of a bottom reflector . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) , we plot normalized decay rate ( @xmath26 ) of the deformed hexapole mode as a function of the air - gap size ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "three different types of the bottom reflector are considered in this study  perfect electric conductor ( pec ) , gold , and dielectrics .",
    "first , let us focus on the ideal mirror case ( pec ) .",
    "as expected , we can observe modulations of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath27 . both enhanced decay ( @xmath26 @xmath28 1 ) and",
    "suppressed decay ( @xmath26 @xmath5 1 ) can occur depending on a specific @xmath27 value .",
    "interestingly , we have found that the modulating features appear to have a certain periodicity .",
    "for example , the two consecutive peak positions ( one at 1.75 @xmath4 and the other at 3.5 @xmath4 ) are separated by @xmath29 . here , it should be noted that , @xmath30 is equal to @xmath31 for the cavity displaced sufficiently far from the underlying mirror , where @xmath32 is the emission wavelength measured in vacuum .",
    "the observed @xmath29 periodicity reminds us of the two - beam interference condition , where the bottom reflector can reverse the downward propagating beam to the upward direction to produce the interference .",
    "we will develop a more rigorous model in the following subsection  [ sec : subsec12 ] .",
    "second , the case of a gold reflector is considered .",
    "we use the dielectric function of gold at rt for emission wavelength of @xmath8 1.3 @xmath33.@xcite slightly increased decay rates in comparison with the previous ideal mirror case are partly due to the additional absorption and the slightly lower reflectivity of gold .",
    "the absorption effect becomes more severe for smaller @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the decay rate becomes noticeably different from the pec case when @xmath34 .",
    "third , when we replace the gold mirror with a simple dielectric substrate with refractive index of 3.4 , the periodic modulation of @xmath9 becomes much weaker than the previous two cases .",
    "this is not surprising because the mirror reflectivity is now only about 30% . for @xmath35 ,",
    "we observe much more enhanced decay rate  at @xmath36 , @xmath26 is about 38 .",
    "such a dramatically enhanced decay rate is mostly due to the enhanced tunneling loss through the bottom substrate and the te - tm coupling loss in the horizontal direction.@xcite in fact , light confinement mechanism in the in - plane directions is no longer perfect as we break the vertical symmetry of the phc slab.@xcite    in all three cases , we observe the break - down of the pbg as @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is much more severe in the case of a dielectric mirror .",
    "we would like to note that @xmath26 converges to 1 in the opposite limit of @xmath38 , though it has not been shown explicitly in those plots . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](e ) , it can be seen that the cavity resonance blue - shifts ( @xmath39 ) as @xmath27 decreases .",
    "such energy - level shifts are also observed from the aforementioned cavity qed example.@xcite one may develop a similar perturbative approach based on electric- and magnetic - multipoles to explain the observed @xmath39 .",
    "however , arguments based on the electromagnetic variational theorem@xcite would suffice to explain differences in @xmath39 in the three different cases  the dielectric mirror case shows the smallest @xmath39 due to the more efficient overlap of the electric - field energy with the dielectric mirror region .",
    "as mentioned previously , the interference of electromagnetic waves is mediated by the bottom mirror to produce the observed decay rate modulation .",
    "remember that the optical loss of the nanocavity is closely related to its far - field radiation pattern , therefore , we expect that the far - field radiation pattern should undergo similar modifications . by using 3-d fdtd",
    ", we can directly simulate a far - field radiation pattern , @xmath40 , of the phc nanocavity , which represents emitted power ( @xmath41 ) within a unit solid angle ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "there exists corresponding wavevector component @xmath43 for each angular direction @xmath44 .",
    "thus , any radiation pattern can be decomposed in terms of planewaves @xmath45 .",
    "this planewave decomposition provides an alternative way to the multipole expansion method .",
    "from now on , we will focus on planewaves with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , since we are interested in the vertical directionality of laser emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3](b ) describes how the complex 2-d slab nanocavity is simplified in the spirit of the planewave decomposition .",
    "the perforated phc membrane is approximated as a uniform dielectric slab with an effective refractive index.@xcite we will deal with the pec mirror case only , where any wave incident upon it will undergo a @xmath48-phase shift .",
    "detailed calculations have been described in our earlier publication,@xcite here we would like to summarize the essential ideas .",
    "first , the final result will depend only on the effective index of the slab , @xmath49 , the phase thickness of the slab , @xmath50 , and the phase thickness of the air - gap , @xmath51 .",
    "once @xmath49 is determined , we can derive coefficients of amplitude reflection and transmission for a single dielectric interface such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "second , all of the scalar waves will be treated as complex numbers in the form @xmath54 .",
    "any wave traveling across a phase thickness of @xmath55 will gain the same amount of phase .",
    "third , we assume that there are two ` seed ' waves , one on the top of the slab and one at the bottom of the slab . both waves are assumed to propagate in the opposite directions with the equal amplitude and phase .",
    "this assumption can be justified by the fact that the original phc nanocavity mode is symmetric with respect to the @xmath17 = 0 plane .",
    "fourth , the wave initially propagating in the downward direction will be redirected upward by the bottom mirror . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) @xmath56 denotes the sum of all such waves finally detected in the far - zone at @xmath57 . during this complex process",
    ", a fraction of the energy can couple to the phc nanocavity mode .",
    "if this coupling occurs , then the resonant mode can produce wavevector components with @xmath58 or @xmath59 . in this model , we assume that this coupling process is negligible and the in - plane wavevector components are conserved .",
    "this assumption is analogous to the _ weak - coupling regime _ in the cavity qed@xcite  once a photon leaves the emitter ( the phc resonant mode ) , it does not strongly interact with the original emitter .",
    "the photon will ` see ' only mirror boundaries of an external cavity ( the bottom mirror and the uniform dielectric slab ) whose @xmath1 is much smaller than that of the emitter .",
    "it should be noted that similar approaches have been applied to the calculation of spontaneous emission inhibition and enhancement of a dipole emitter in a cavity.@xcite    ( a ) vertical emission enhancement factor ( @xmath60 ) obtained by the planewave interference model .",
    "both the air - gap size and the slab thickness are varied and the results of varying slab thicknesses were shown as multiple curves as a function of the air - gap .",
    "we have assumed the effective refractive index of the slab ( @xmath61 ) to be 2.6 , which will result in @xmath62 .",
    "( b ) a schematic of the model for the photonic crystal nanocavity suspending over a bottom reflector .",
    "the perforated slab is replaced with a uniform dielectric slab with @xmath61 and the underlying mirror is assumed to be pec.,width=453 ]    with all the assumptions above , the relative vertical enhancement can be written as @xmath63 , which is normalized to the result in the absence of the bottom reflector . here is the final result of the summation .",
    "@xmath64    we plot @xmath60 as a function of the air - gap size ( @xmath51 ) , where we assume @xmath49 to be 2.6 in consideration of the effective surface coverage ratio of @xmath65 $ ] for the phc slab with @xmath66 . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the results for various @xmath50 values ( the slab thickness ) . when @xmath50 satisfies the ` slab resonance ' condition ( @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an integer ) , the slab will be ` transparent ' for any wave incident upon it . under this condition ,",
    "the redirected wave from the bottom mirror does not ` see ' the slab , which result in the simple two - beam interference .",
    "@xmath60 modulates between 0 and 4 by varying the air - gap size .",
    "the effective thickness of a phc slab is typically chosen to be around ` @xmath69 ' in order to maximize the pbg,@xcite which happens to be near the slab resonance condition .",
    "this implies that near 100% transmission is possible by slightly tuning the emission wavelength toward the exact slab resonance condition.@xcite then , the subsequent optimization of the air - gap size can bring up the vertical emission intensity by up to a factor of 4 .",
    "here , it is worth mentioning that the enhancement factor is a quantity proportional to the decay rate .",
    "thus , the fact that @xmath70 does not violate the conservation of energy  most of the electromagnetic energy , @xmath71 , is stored in the cavity and it will experience exponential decay in time such that @xmath72 $ ] , where the decay rate , @xmath9 , is proportional to @xmath60 .",
    "conversely , if the air - gap size is chosen to be @xmath73 , then , for an ideal 1-d system , we can completely quench the radiation to the vertical direction , resulting in infinitely large @xmath1 .",
    "similar unbounded @xmath1 behavior has been found from the second @xmath74-point band - edge state in a 2-d honeycomb - lattice phc slab@xcite and the @xmath74-point band - edge state in a 2-d triangular - lattice phc slab,@xcite with and without using a bottom reflector , respectively .",
    "now let us turn to our original problem and find out the condition that maximizes @xmath60 .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath60 can increase up to about 9 by tuning the slab thickness near the ` slab antiresonance ' ( @xmath75 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a).@xcite this phenomenon can be understood by the fact that the slab becomes highly reflective ( reflectance can be as high as 70% due to the absence of the slab resonance).@xcite thus , the slab and the bottom mirror system constitutes a certain vertical resonator , which enhances the density of photon modes near @xmath76 point . in the following subsection , through rigorous 3-d fdtd simulations",
    ", we will show that over six - fold vertical emission enhancement can be achieved in the deformed hexapole mode example .",
    "fdtd simulated far - field emission profiles from the deformed hexapole mode shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . far - field patterns detected over the hemispherical surface are transformed into the 2-d plane by using a simple mapping defined by @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "numbers represent the air - gap size normalized to the emission wavelength of the reference cavity ( @xmath79 ) in the absence of the mirror.,width=453 ]      the planewave interference model predicts that vertical emission can be enhanced by more than a factor of 4 . here",
    ", we would like to test the validity of the model by using rigorous fdtd simulation . in our previous paper",
    ", we have adopted the near- to far - field transformation algorithm for more efficient and fast simulation.@xcite however , for more accurate results , we will perform direct fdtd simulations in a very large computational domain with @xmath80 .",
    "we take the same deformed hexapole mode shown in fig  [ fig : fig2 ] as an example and assume a pec bottom mirror .",
    "note that we will vary only the air - gap size while we keep the slab thickness constant at @xmath12 .",
    "first , far - field emission profiles , @xmath81 , are obtained by detecting the radial component of the poynting vectors over a hemispherical surface whose radius is larger than @xmath82 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "these far - field patterns are then normalized by the original far - field pattern , @xmath83 , obtained in the absence of the bottom reflector ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) . by varying the gap size",
    ", it is found that the internal electromagnetic energy , @xmath71 , does not show noticeable change within the fdtd time needed for the far - field simulation .",
    "thus , errors associated with small variations in @xmath71 will be less than 1% .",
    "we present normalized far - field patterns , @xmath84 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a ) , where we use a simple mapping defined by @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the center corresponds to @xmath57 and the angle @xmath85 will be proportional to the radial distance from the origin . clearly , we can have more than six - fold enhancement by choosing the air - gap to be near @xmath86 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) , we plot @xmath87 as a function of air - gap size .",
    "the three solid lines are from the previous planewave interference model , for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "generally , the curve for @xmath90 shows good agreement with the fdtd results .",
    "interestingly , the model also predicts the asymmetric behavior around @xmath91 as is confirmed by the fdtd result  the enhancement value decreases more slowly on the left side than on the right side .",
    "thus , both the fdtd result and the planewave interference model confirm that the vertical emission can be enhanced by more than a factor of 6 by employing a highly reflective mirror at the bottom .",
    "these findings will be of significant importance to the design of various phc based light emitters , such as nanolasers and single - photon sources.@xcite the emission wavelength is a rather fixed property by the active material embedded in the slab . in most wafer designs , the final selective wet - etching process will leave a flat surface of a dielectric substrate , which will serve as a good bottom mirror as we have shown in fig .

    "fig : fig2 ] .",
    "furthermore , in gaas material systems , we may include a gaas / alas dbr whose resultant reflectivity will be over 98% . to optimize the vertical directionality ,",
    "the following two criteria should be considered for the wafer design .",
    "1 ) the thickness of the sacrificial layer ( which is to become the air - gap ) should be designed to be equal to the emission wavelength .",
    "2 ) the phc slab thickness should be chosen to be near the slab antiresonance . however , in consideration of the pbg size , the slab thickness may be limited by @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . it should be noted that , the enhanced directional emission has been verified from inp / ingaasp phc nanolasers by direct measurement of far - field emission profiles.@xcite",
    "as mentioned previously , the planewave interference model may not be applicable to the case where the air - gap size is below @xmath94 .",

    "this @xmath130 point corresponds to the ideal 2-d limit in the @xmath126-@xmath127 diagram .",

    "one can easily show that any medium with @xmath166 can not support any propagating planewave solution.@xcite this result reminds us of light propagation behavior within the pbg .",

    "we denote the mass of an electron and the volume density of electrons as @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig9](a ) shows @xmath1 and the wavelength as a function of the slab thickness . here , we would like to emphasize that @xmath1 obtained in this way is different from the radiation @xmath1 defined in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : eq13 ] ) , because the optical constants of gold have been changed .",
    "though the change is small , it is large enough to produce a noticeable difference in @xmath154 because the reflectivity of the metal is not the same any more .",
    "the presence of a peak in @xmath1 at @xmath207 nm seems to have the similar origin , the vertical resonance within the slab , as argued by tandaechanurat , _",
    "et al._@xcite except for this feature , @xmath1 tends to increase almost linearly up to 2,000 at @xmath208 nm .",

    "even when @xmath211 nm , @xmath209 is just above 4% .",
    "these values are much lower compared to those obtained by the spp mode ; only at very small wavevectors of @xmath212 , such low values would be obtained .",
    "therefore , our hybrid metal / phc cavity mode is _ photonic - like _ rather than _ plasmon - like _ and the role of the metal mirror is not to generate plasmons but to serve as a mirror .",
    "we apply our definition of @xmath182 to the metal nanodisk cavity , which we have proposed recently.@xcite specifically , we take the two example modes , the monopole mode and the spp - like mode , both emitting at @xmath213 nm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig10 ] ) .",
    "the spp - like mode , as expected , shows a large @xmath182 of 58.3% while the monopole mode shows @xmath182 of 13.3 % .",
    "therefore , we believe that the proposed formula provides reasonable quantitative measures for a wide range of metallic nanocavity designs . if metallic and dielectric structures of complex geometrical shapes play an important role in the formation of an electromagnetic mode of interest , a simple judgment based on the the mode profile can be misleading and does not provide any useful information on the internal properties of plasmons .",
    "however , the _ plasmonicty _ @xmath182 requires simple volume integrations of energy densities .",
    "thus , it can be easily applied to various situations regardless of how complex the cavity geometry is .",
    "there are two different routes of using metallic nanocavities for building coherent light emitters .",
    "one is to build an efficient light emitter , where the role of the metal is to serve as a mirror .",
    "one such example is our hybrid metal / phc nanocavity .",
    "the other way is to build an efficient plasmonic source , also known as a spaser ( surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation).@xcite such a ( dark ) plasmonic source would generate more plasmons rather than photons . in this context , it seems that the true spaser should have very small radiation efficiency .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous sections , the conventional definition of radiation efficiency ( eq .  ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) ) could be misleading since it contains the effect of the irreversible damping process and the metallic absorption is not an essential property of plasmons .",
    "the concept of plasmonicity defined here may provide a useful guideline for the optimization of the spaser source . by the same token",
    ", it could serve equally well for the development of efficient photon sources based on a metallic mirror . in both applications , however , increasing @xmath98 will be critical to achieve the condition for the stimulated emission .",
