    "the string model is widely used in phenomenologies of quark confinement and hadronization . a basic system of interest in the string model consists of a heavy quark ( @xmath0 ) and antiquark ( @xmath1 ) pair , which are assumed to be bound by a narrow tube of color flux .",
    "this model naturally gives rise to a linearly confining potential , if the tube has a cross - section that is approximately independent of the quark separation @xcite .",
    "in fact simulations of quenched lattice qcd long ago demonstrated the formation of color - flux tubes having properties that are in accord with simple models .    in full qcd the confining @xmath2 string should not persist to arbitrarily large separations @xmath3 , due to the effects of dynamical sea quarks .",
    "one expects that it becomes energetically favorable for a light quark ( @xmath4 ) and antiquark ( @xmath5 ) to materialize from the dirac sea at large @xmath3 , and the light quarks should bind to the heavy quarks resulting in the formation of a pair of noninteracting color - neutral mesons .",
    "this phenomenon of hadronization , or string breaking , implies for instance that the potential @xmath6 for a static @xmath7 pair should saturate at large separations , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the ground - state heavy - light meson .",
    "observation of eq .",
    "( [ potentialsaturation ] ) in an unquenched lattice qcd simulation provides the simplest criterion to demonstrate string breaking .",
    "a much more detailed probe of this basic phenomenon of hadronic physics would come from measurements of the local color fields @xmath10 as functions of position @xmath11 in the region between the static valence quarks , for various values of @xmath3 .",
    "the effects of dynamical quarks should be to suppress the fields in the region between the static sources , with the fields saturating at vacuum values in the limit of large @xmath3 @xmath12 for @xmath11 outside a finite region surrounding each static valence quark , corresponding to the size of the @xmath13 meson .    despite considerable effort ,",
    "however , it has proven to be very difficult to establish eq .",
    "( [ potentialsaturation ] ) , and especially eq .  ( [ fieldsaturation ] ) , in unquenched lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "the traditional computational strategy is to use wilson loop operators in order to create trial states containing only static sources , with no valence light quarks . in that case",
    "( [ potentialsaturation ] ) and ( [ fieldsaturation ] ) provide unambiguous evidence of the effects of light quarks that `` materialize '' from the sea ( one must take care to note however that euclidean lattice simulations only provide an analogy to the real - time process of hadronization ) .",
    "the difficulty in making these measurements on the lattice is due in part to the exponential suppression of the correlators , reflecting the large energy of the state at large separations @xmath3 , and the large propagation time @xmath14 which is necessary in order to isolate the ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "a convincing demonstration of the saturation of the unquenched @xmath6 has only recently been achieved , thanks in part to the realization that improved actions can be used to do accurate simulations on lattices with coarse grids , where the computational effort can go into generating large ensembles of gauge - fields at the large length scales relevant to string breaking , rather than to generating short - distance modes that are not of interest here @xcite .",
    "studies of the local color - fields are still more problematic than the static potential ; the simplest definition of @xmath10 comes from the correlator between the wilson loop and the square of the local field strength , which requires a vacuum subtraction , leading to a very poor signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a demonstration that the fields in the region between the heavy quarks become vacuum saturated has not been realized to date .    in this work we turn to euclidean lattice qcd in three dimensions ( qcd@xmath15 ) , exploiting the computational advantage of this toy model ( including a power law suppression of lattice discretization errors in this super - renormalizable theory ) in order to convincingly demonstrate that dynamical quarks lead to saturation of the static potential and the local color fields .",
    "this has been done using very little computational power .",
    "lattice studies of confinement physics using qcd@xmath15 have a long history ; this theory exhibits most of the hallmarks of four - dimensional qcd , including confinement , flux - tube formation , chiral symmetry breaking , a rich glueball spectrum , and a finite - temperature deconfining phase transition @xcite .",
    "some of the work presented here is a follow - up to an earlier study on string breaking in unquenched qcd@xmath15 by one of us @xcite .",
    "what is new includes a much more extensive study of the static potential on larger lattices and with higher statistics , enabling measurements of the potential out to substantially larger @xmath3 .",
    "more important , in this work we provide the first demonstration in unquenched lattice qcd , as defined in any number of dimensions , of vacuum saturation of the local color fields .",
    "although these results are for a three - dimensional theory , they have important implications for string breaking studies in qcd@xmath16 .",
    "in particular we find that string breaking is observed using trial states without light valence quarks , when they are propagated for euclidean times @xmath17  fm , longer than what has been attained in earlier unsuccessful studies , but not excessively so , this being the natural scale associated with hadronic binding . [ as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we find a consistent relation between the physical length scales in qcd@xmath15 and in four - dimensional hadronic physics , using two very different quantities to identify the lattice spacing in qcd@xmath15 : the quenched string tension , and the lightest unquenched vector meson mass , analogous to the @xmath18 . ]",
    "saturation in both the potential ( as previously observed in @xcite ) , and in the local color fields , is found to occur at separations @xmath19  fm , which is similar to estimates of the string breaking scale in qcd@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions are noisy , yet a sufficiently large ensemble of configurations was generated with relatively little computational effort , even by the standards of the intrinsically cheaper three - dimensional theory , because we used improved actions to accurately simulate on coarse lattices , with spatial spacings @xmath20  fm .",
    "the same reasoning should apply to the situation in unquenched qcd@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we describe the lattice actions and simulation parameters , and we also discuss our scale setting procedure for making contact between qcd@xmath15 and qcd@xmath16 .",

    "unquenched simulations of su(2 ) color in three dimensions were done using a tree - level @xmath21-accurate improved gluon action , allowing for different `` temporal '' and `` spatial '' lattice spacings @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively @xmath24 , \\label{sglue}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is one - half the trace of the @xmath26 plaquette and @xmath27 is one - half the trace of the @xmath28 rectangle in the @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 plane .",

    "[ sec : simulations ] concerning the scale setting procedure that is used for this purpose ) . nonetheless this comparison is instructive , as it highlights the advantages to be gained by working on coarser lattices .",
    "in unquenched qcd@xmath16 the computational cost scales with lattice spacing roughly as @xmath42 , hence a small increase in the coarseness of the lattice can significantly reduce the computational cost , allowing one to generate much larger ensembles and/or to work at much smaller quark masses .",
    "indeed the qcd@xmath16 study in ref .",
    "@xcite , which did resolve string breaking in the static potential , only required the equivalent of few pc - years of run time ( comparable to the cost of the present study ) .    in this work we balanced the desire to use the coarsest lattice possible , in order to minimize the computational cost , against the need to have a spacing that is fine enough to resolve the spatial distribution of the color fields .",
