    "the introduction of submillimeter ( submm ) , imaging arrays such as scuba ( submillimeter common user bolometer array ; holland et al 1999 ) , heralds a revolution in our understanding of the dust properties of external spiral galaxies . for the first time",
    ", we can map cold ( 15 - 20k ) interstellar grains with high sensitivity and good spatial resolution ( @xmath4 ) ( chini et al 1995 ; hughes et al 1997 ; clements et al 1993 ) .",
    "previous studies of radiation emitted by dust have relied heavily on measurements carried out by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) at 60 and @xmath5 m . these wavebands are sensitive primarily to warm ( @xmath3 30k ) dust , and as such , are unlikely to give an accurate impression of either the true quantity or distribution of interstellar grains in external disks ( alton et al 1998a ; devereux & young 1990 ) .",
    "furthermore , satellite missions such as iras , and the recently completed infrared space observatory ( iso ) project , are constrained at present to using small mirrors ( 0.6-m c.f .  scuba 15-m dish ) .",
    "this limits their resolving capability to @xmath6 in the far - infrared ( fir ) which is only adequate for probing disk structure in the very closest spiral galaxies ( alton et al 1998b ) .",
    "+ one of the first studies of nearby galaxies , using scuba , was carried out by alton et al ( 1998c ) who mapped the edge - on galaxy ngc 891 at 450 and @xmath0 m ( see also israel et al 1999 ) . by carefully comparing the submm emission over the same region as the fir flux ( @xmath7 ) , they found that this galaxy contains about an order of magnitude more dust than would have been inferred from iras observations alone .",
    "this same conclusion was reached by xilouris et al ( 1999 ) who fitted the optical and near - infrared surface photometry of both ngc 891 and 6 other nearby , edge - on spirals with a sophisticated radiation transfer simulation .",
    "their model , which takes account of both scattering and absorption by interstellar grains , only produces a self - consistent solution across several wavebands if the extinction lane harbours about 10 times more dust than might be expected from iras measurements . + in this paper",
    ", we relate the extinction modelling carried out for ngc 891 ( xilouris et al 1998 ; hereafter xad ) with the corresponding submm images acquired from scuba ( alton et al 1998c ; hereafter abr ) . in doing so",
    ", we address some important issues , namely :    1 .",
    "whether the submm emission , which accounts for the bulk of grain material in ngc 891 , correlates closely with the dust evident in the extinction lane (  [ rtm ] ) ; 2 .   in the case of a positive correlation ,",
    "whether the submm emissivity in ngc 891 ( or , equivalently , the grain mass - absorption coefficient ) is comparable to that recorded for our own galaxy (  [ emissivity ] ) ; 3 .",
    "given that we recover most of the dust mass from our submm images , how the gas - to - dust ratio varies along the major axis of ngc 891([gdratio ] ) ; 4 .   how the submm emission is distributed with respect to the neutral gas phases ( hi , h@xmath8 ) and the stars in the disk (  [ gdratio ] ) .",
    "this information will prove crucial to the growing number of submm surveys , where sources are poorly resolved and subsidary observational data are limited .",
    "we begin by summarizing the salient results from xad and abr (  [ submm ] and  [ rtm ] ) before seeking to relate the submm to the extinction dust lane .",
    "abr obtained the deepest images yet of a nearby galaxy in the submillimeter waveband .",
    "they detected emission from @xmath9 of the optical disk , down to a noise - limited surface brightness of 3.5mjy/@xmath10beam and 13mjy/@xmath11beam at 850 and @xmath12 m respectively . at both submm wavelengths ,",
    "the flux exhibits a pronounced peak at the nucleus and secondary maxima @xmath13 either side of the centre ( equivalent to 3 kpc for a distance of 9.5 mpc , adopted by both abr and xad , to ngc 891 ) .",
    "the secondary maxima may be attributable to a ring structure seen edge - on or limb - brightening associated with spiral arms .",
    "we do not present the scuba maps here , but refer to abr for both these images and more technical details _ vis - a - vis _ the observing procedure .",
    "the submm maps are much more radially - extended than the corresponding emission detected by iras , indicating that longer wavelength fir radiation dominates at larger galactic radii .",
    "+ abr made a careful estimate of the ratio of cold dust to warm grains by smoothing all their submm / fir images of ngc 891 ( 60,100,450 & @xmath0 m ) to the same resolution and then dividing the major axis into spatially - independent radial bins .",
    "this uniform treatment of the data was considered of major importance because there had been a tendency , in the past , to compare photometry at different wavelengths without regard for , or knowledge of , differences in the size of the relevant emitting region(s ) ( e.g.  guelin et al 1993 ; israel et al 1999 ; clements et al 1993 ) .",
    "the flux density emanating from each radial bin was matched by the superposition of 2 greybody curves .",
    "thus :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the flux density at wavelength @xmath16 ( in wm@xmath17hz@xmath18 ) , @xmath19 is the geometrical cross - sectional area of an interstellar grain , @xmath20 is the distance to ngc 891 and @xmath21 is the submm emissivity . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the number of emitters ( grains ) in the warm and cold dust components respectively whilst @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the corresponding blackbody intensities .",
    "@xmath21 is sometimes refered to as the emission efficiency and can be considered as the ratio of the emission cross - section to the geometrical cross - section of the grain ( spitzer 1978 ; whittet 1992 ) .",
    "+ abr found that all radial bins could be fitted well with @xmath26=15 - 20k was given as @xmath276k but the more correct range is 15 - 20k ] and @xmath28=30 - 37k , and @xmath29 increased from about 26 at the nucleus to 54 at @xmath30 .",
    "the _ ratio _",
    "@xmath29 is fairly secure .",
    "_ however _ , the exact dust masses pertaining to @xmath23 and @xmath22 depend critically on the absolute level of @xmath21 which , as we shall see , is highly uncertain .",
    "at this stage , it is important to emphasize that over 90% of the @xmath0 m emission arises , at all radii , from the cold ( 15 - 20k ) dust component and that this material , in turn , constitutes the bulk of galactic dust . in other words",
    ", our @xmath0 m scuba map indicates , almost completely , how galactic dust is distributed within ngc 891 .",
    "moreover , if we could avail ourselves of a well - determined value for the grain emissivity at @xmath0 m , @xmath31 , our scuba image would yield , to a good approximation , the total dust mass in the disk .",
    "+ the submm / fir emissivity , @xmath21 , is a poorly known quantity and virtually the only sources of information stem from hildebrand ( 1983 ) and draine & lee ( 1984 ) , which are cited almost exclusively in the literature .",
    "the measurement of hildebrand ( 1983 ) is based on kuiper observations ( 55 and @xmath32 m ) of a single galactic reflection nebula , ngc 7023 , where attenuation of ultraviolet light from the central star is effectively used to constrain the amount of dust present . in order to account for the observed fir flux densities ,",
    "the emissivity at @xmath32 m was estimated to lie in the range @xmath33 .",
    "although this represents little better than an order of magnitude determination , the emissivity of hildebrand has been applied by fir observers almost religiously since its derivation nearly 2 decades ago .",
    "this is at least partially attributable to a dearth of measurements in the interim years , in particular observations applicable to the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) where grains may well differ from their particulate counterparts in reflection nebulae ( pendleton et al 1990 ; mathis 1990 ) .",
    "we note that casey ( 1991 ) has repeated the hildebrand procedure for 5 galactic reflection nebulae ( and derived an emissivity approaching the upper limit of the hildebrand determination ) , but this work has been seldom cited in the literature .",
    "draine and lee ( 1984 ) have used a _ pot pourri _ of laboratory measurements and astronomical data to construct dielectric functions appropriate to graphite and silicate interstellar grains . in this way",
    ", they have derived a fir emissivity close to the mean value given by hildebrand .",
    "finally , we note that bianchi et al ( 1999 ) recently determined an emissivity value of @xmath34 for the diffuse dust in the milky way at @xmath5 m .",
    "their technique relied on the tight spatial correlation observed between interstellar extinction and the fir radiation detected by cobe .",
    "this allowed them , in a similar fashion to hildebrand , to constrain the amount of dust responsible for the fir emission .",
    "depending on the exact behaviour of @xmath35 with wavelength ( discussed below ) , the bianchi et al value is somewhere towards the higher end of the hildebrand range .",
    "+ in the following sections , we attempt an independent determination of the submm / fir emissivity in ngc 891 by using extinction observed in the disk to constrain the amount of grain material present .",
    "this approach differs from previous treatments of extragalactic submm / mm observations where , to one extent or another , workers have tended to make use of dust properties in the milky way in order to infer quantities in external galaxies .",
    "for example , guelin et al ( 1993 ) use a galactic emissivity to turn their 1.3 mm observations into a dust column density . assuming a solar gas - to - dust ratio",
    "they then quantify how much ( molecular ) gas is present in the system . in a slightly different approach , neininger et al ( 1996 ) use 21 cm emission to infer a dust column density ( again via a galactic gas - to - dust ratio ) and then compare this quantity with their observed submm / mm emission in order to derive the corresponding emissivity .",
    "our current method is based on the technique pioneered by hildebrand ( 1983 ) .",
    "in essence , the dust column density is measured by means of optical / ultraviolet extinction and this quantity is then compared to the observed fir / submm emission in order to infer the long wavelength emissivity . in deriving @xmath21",
    "we make no direct use of galactic properties as such . whilst we follow the same general method as hildebrand , we believe that the submm window produces more robust values of emissivity than fits made to the emission near the greybody peak ( hildebrand fits near @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , for any observed level of fir / submm flux , the implied dust mass will vary at least as strongly as @xmath36 for emission near the peak but only @xmath37 in the rayleigh - jean tail ( where @xmath38 is the grain temperature ) .",
    "if the dust mass is fixed _ a priori _ by the amount of extinction , the corresponding uncertainties are then transfered to the derived values of emissivity .",
    "thus @xmath39 will be much more dependent on the grain temperature than @xmath40 and , as a consequence , far more uncertain ( see hughes et al 1997 for an indepth discussion ) .",
    "+ before we are able to embark on this process for ngc 891 , we have to be sure that the submm , which traces the bulk of the dust in this galaxy , corresponds closely to the grain material responsible for the absorption lane .",
    "to this end , we briefly describe the photometric fit made to ngc 891 by xad which yields directly the optical depth at each point in the disk .",
    "the approach adopted by xad ( see also xilouris et al 1997;1999 ) is to simulate the optical / nir appearance of edge - on spirals by creating a model galaxy consisting of an exponential stellar disk , a r@xmath41 bulge and an exponential dust distribution .",
    "a pixel - to - pixel comparison is made between the real and simulated object in order to fit scale - heights ( z - direction ) and scale - lengths ( radial direction ) to both the stellar and dust disks and to determine the optical depth through the centre of the galaxy ( as seen face - on ) .",
    "in addition to radiation absorption , the model takes account of photon scattering in the disk by adopting the henyey - greenstein phase function ( henyey & greenstein 1941 ; bohren & huffman 1983 ) .",
    "our confidence in the model is significantly boosted by the fact that the output parameters are highly consistent across several optical and nir wavebands .",
    "thus for ngc 891 , the radial scale - length for the grain distribution is calculated to be 8.1 kpc in the v - band whilst a determination in the remaining filters ( k , j , i , b ) strays by only 5 - 10% from this value .",
    "simulations for 7 edge - on galaxies indicate , in all cases , an extinction lane consistent with galactic - type reddening .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our modelling of the dust lane vastly transcends simplistic screen models ( which have often been applied in the past ) and takes full account of mixing between stars and dust . admittedly , one obvious limitation to our simulation is that no account is taken of dust clumping or indeed spiral structure within the disk .",
    "kylafis et al ( 1999 ) have tested the influence of spiral structure on the radiation transfer in ngc 891 and found that it produces almost no change to the large - scale properties inferred from the model .",
    "clumping , on the other hand , may well ` hide ' large amounts of dust so that it can not be detected by a fit to the large - scale extinction .",
    "we postpone a discussion on the effects that clumping might have on our results until later (  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "+ since we shall be concentrating on the v - band when making a comparison between extinction in ngc 891 and the submm emission detected by abr , we reproduce in table  [ tab1 ] the relevant parameters fitted by xad at this wavelength . using the tabulated parameters , we can construct a synthetic map of v - band optical depth ( @xmath42 ) , which , after smoothing to the same spatial resolution as the @xmath0 m scuba map ( @xmath10 fwhm ) , can be compared directly with the submm image . in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we display profiles of @xmath42 along the minor and major axes of the galaxy model after the smoothing process .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 m cross - sections are also shown . in all cases ,",
    "a width of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 beam fwhm ) is used to sample the emission / optical - depth perpendicular to the profile direction . the submm profile , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is the mean of several transects across the major axis taken at various distances from the galactic nucleus . the average profile has been normalized , along with the @xmath42 curve , to unity at zero z - height .",
    "we can see that the observed and model profiles are extremely similar in this direction ( a deconvolved size of @xmath45 or 610 pc for both fwhm ) . to some extent , this similarity may be attributable to the point spread function ( psf ) being quite large with respect to the intrinsic dust layer .",
    "however , by artificially varying the scale - height of @xmath42 , before smoothing , we have assured ourselves that the thickness of the absorption lane must lie within 30% of the submm width . for z - heights of @xmath46 ( 900 - 2300 pc ) , there is an excess at @xmath0 m over what would be expected purely from the extinction model .",
    "the scuba beam is principally gaussian but slight wings in the psf may contribute to this observed excess .",
    "in fact , until a more careful comparison is made between the high - z ` emission ' and the psf wings ( alton et al 1999a ) , we are not in a position to attribute this excess to the ` vertical ' dust chimneys evident in optical images of ngc 891 ( howk & savage 1997 ; dettmar 1990 ) .",
    "+ for profiles along the major axis , we plot the optical depth given by the model against the observed @xmath0 m surface brightness ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that when the comparison is made here , it is after the opacity model has been smoothed to the same resolution as the submm image ( thus @xmath42 is a factor of 4 lower than the optical depth directly inferred from the original optical image ) .",
    "the correspondance along the major axis is not as good as that for the minor axis and can only be described as fair .",
    "due to its simplicity , we clearly can not expect the xad model to reproduce the local fluctuations in the submm profile .",
    "however , on average , the @xmath42 curve still appears to be somewhat more extended than the @xmath0 m emission .",
    "in fact , if we could choose a @xmath42 curve that would match the behaviour of scuba data perfectly , the dust model would have a scale - length of @xmath475.3 kpc as opposed to 8.1 kpc derived by xad . under such circumstances the dust layer would possess the same radial fall - off as the v - band stars .",
    "the ratio between optical depth and @xmath0 m surface brightness , averaged over the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is as follows :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the submm surface brightness , in jy/@xmath10beam , and the uncertainty represents the standard deviation of a linear fit between @xmath49 and @xmath42 .",
    "+ although the major axis fit between submm emission and optical attenuation is only fair , we will assume that in both cases the same population of grains manifests itself .",
    "certainly , simulations of dust bathed in interstellar radiation fields suggest that the classical ` big grains ' , which are responsible for extinction ( size @xmath50 m ) , increasingly dominate the emission process at wavelengths beyond @xmath51 m ( desert et al 1990 ) . and",
    "indeed , observationally , bianchi et al ( 1998 ) have recently established a convincing correlation between optical extinction and submm emission in the nearby spiral ngc 7331 .",
    "for ngc 891 , we therefore fix the @xmath0 m surface brightness with respect to the visual optical depth , @xmath42 , according to eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] . by doing this",
    ", we will be able to derive the dust emissivity at @xmath0 m .",
    "this calculation is carried out in the next section .",
    "as mentioned in  [ submm ] , the @xmath0 m waveband is completely dominated by cold dust ( 15 - 20k ) at all positions in the disk .",
    "in fact , the rayleigh - jeans tail of the warm grain component contributes about 8% to the flux density in this filter .",
    "it is possible , therefore , to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] approximately as follows :    @xmath52    where @xmath23 , the number of cold grains , comprises the bulk of interstellar dust in ngc 891 .",
    "in order to be able to use the ratio @xmath53 ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) in this relation , we have to refer to the definition of optical depth , namely :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the dust column density ( grains per unit surface area of galaxy ) , @xmath19 , as before , represents the geometrical grain cross - section and @xmath56 constitutes the emissivity , or extinction efficiency , in the v - band .",
    "+ if we can derive the flux density per unit surface area , @xmath23 in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] becomes @xmath55 and we will be in a position to substitute @xmath42 , from eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] , into eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] . to do this we use @xmath49 , the @xmath0 m surface brightness ( in jy/@xmath10beam ) . dividing @xmath49 by the beam area ( in m@xmath57 ) , and multiplying by @xmath58 to convert from jansky to wm@xmath17hz@xmath18",
    ", we obtain the flux density per unit surface area ( as required ) .",
    "this can be substituted into the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] thus :    @xmath59    where @xmath55 has now replaced @xmath23 .",
    "+ substituting @xmath55 with @xmath60 ( eq .  [ eq4 ] ) , we can eliminate the geometrical grain cross - section @xmath19 ( the distance d also falls out ) , leaving :    @xmath61    for the blackbody intensity , @xmath62 , we adopt a grain temperature of @xmath63 k. then , comparing with eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , we obtain the emissivity at @xmath0 m with respect to the v - band emissivity as :    @xmath64    to derive @xmath65 directly from eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] , we must have some knowledge of @xmath56 . for ` classical ' grains of radius @xmath66 m , which are responsible for optical extinction in the diffuse ism of the milky way , @xmath56 lies between 1 and 2 ( whittet 1992 ; alton 1996 ; spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "the interstellar grains of ngc 891 are unlikely to be much different in this respect , given that extinction within the disk corresponds extremely well to a galactic reddening law (  [ rtm ] ) .",
    "thus we use @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] to infer :    @xmath68      the grain emissivity within the milky way has usually been estimated at shorter fir wavelengths ( e.g.  hildebrand finds @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is difficult , therefore , to compare galactic data with eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] unless we assume some sort of wavelength behaviour for the dust emissivity .",
    "fortunately , a large amount of recent observational evidence seems to be converging on an emissivity , _ for the general ism of non - active spirals _ , which varies as @xmath70 where the spectral index @xmath71 for @xmath72 m .",
    "indeed , rigorous fir spectral measurements of milky way dust , using both cobe and balloon - borne instruments , imply a spectral index between 1.5 and 2.0 for the diffuse ism in the galaxy ( masi et al 1995 ; reach et al 1995 ) .",
    "likewise , the relatively high flux density at @xmath12 m compared to emission at @xmath0 m , for galaxies such as ngc 891 and ngc 7331 , is indicative of an index @xmath73 ( bianchi et al 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the dust emissivity for ngc 891 ( as a ratio @xmath74 ) assuming a wavelength dependency @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "estimates for the fir emissivity of milky way dust , as derived by hildebrand ( 1983 ) , casey ( 1991 ) , draine & lee ( 1984 ) and bianchi et al ( 1999b ) ( see  [ submm ] ) , are annotated on this plot .",
    "we also add the emissivity measured by agladze et al ( 1994 ) for ` astronomical - type ' silicates tested at 20k under laboratory - controlled conditions .",
    "+ the fir grain emissivity in ngc 891 appears to be somewhat higher than most estimates of the same property in the milky way . in particular , the ` canonical ' values of draine & lee ( 1984 ) and hildebrand ( 1983 ) are about a factor of 2 - 3 lower than the quantity we have derived here .",
    "the discrepancy is admittedly smaller for an emissivity law following @xmath77 , but both the draine and lee model and the bianchi determination are consistent with @xmath78 and should , therefore , strictly speaking , be compared with the steepest line in fig .",
    "similarly , the lowest values of @xmath79 , as given by hildebrand , are derived under the assumption that @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the agreement in this case can only be described as marginal . in this respect",
    ", the ngc 891 emissivity seems more consistent with the casey ( 1991 ) observations ( although why there should be such a difference between the hildebrand ( 1983 ) and casey ( 1991 ) measurements , when both apply to galactic reflection nebulae , is not altogether clear ) .",
    "although the fir emissivity we predict for ngc 891 is somewhat higher than most values used for the galaxy , it is still much lower than the inference from laboratory - controlled experiments .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath65 , implied by agladze et al , are astonishingly high , although the authors themselves do not offer an explanation as to why there is such an incongruence with astronomical observations .",
    "+ it would certainly be something of a surprise if interstellar grains in ngc 891 possess a submm emissivity grossly different from milky way dust ( particularly since xad find that extinction within ngc 891 is characterized by a galactic reddening law ) .",
    "the velocity fields and distribution of neutral gas within the disks of both systems has been noted by several authors as being strikingly similar ( guelin et al 1993 ; garcia - burillo et al 1992 ; scoville et al 1993 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that ngc 891 may display a somewhat more active halo with ` thick disks ' of both neutral and ionized gas extending to several kpc above the midplane ( dettmar 1990 ) .",
    "since this extended disk only contains a few percent of the total dust in ngc 891 ( howk & savage 1997 ; alton et al 1999a ) , the activity at the disk - halo interface should not necessarily imply any general pecularities for the dust properties of the _ main _ disk .",
    "although the error bar in fig .  [ fig4 ] represents only a 30% standard deviation in the fit between the submm and opacity measurements , the total uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath65 is quite likely to be about a factor of 2 ( due to @xmath80% error in both @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "moreover , measurements of fir emissivity for galactic grains are likely to be uncertain by an order of magnitude once extrapolated to submm wavelengths ( hughes et al 1993 )",
    ". therefore we should not be unduly worried by the factor 2 - 3 difference between the emissivity derived for ngc 891 and estimates of the corresponding property for the milky way .",
    "it is interesting to note that grain models which successfully reproduce the extinction law within our own galaxy , can display radically different submm emissivities .",
    "for example , the fluffy agglomerates of silicate and carbon , that have been postulated by matthis & whiffen ( 1989 ) , satisfy the near - infrared to ultraviolet reddening law in much the same way as the draine & lee ( 1984 ) model .",
    "however in comparison to the latter , they possess an emissivity nearly 3 times larger at @xmath83 .",
    "+ as a confirmatory _ addendum _ to the preceding paragraph , we note that dunne et al ( 1999 ) estimate the submm mass - absorption coefficient in ngc 891 ( @xmath84 ) by using our reported values of @xmath0 m flux density ( abr ) and fixing the dust mass via depletion arguments rather than observed extinction ( a constant fraction of interstellar metals are assumed to be bound up in grains ) .",
    "the dunne et al analysis yields @xmath85 m@xmath57kg@xmath18 which , for grains of radius @xmath66 m and material density 3000 kgm@xmath86 , corresponds to @xmath87 , i.e. almost exactly the value we derive in eq .  [ eq8 ] . ] + as mentioned previously , one cause for concern in our derivation of submm emissivity is the fact that the opacity simulations of xad do not account for dust clumping .",
    "this will tend to _ underestimate _ the amount of dust causing extinction within the disk .",
    "witt et al ( 1999 ; also witt priv .",
    "have analysed v - k excesses from spirals disks using homogeneous and clumpy - phase models and found that the latter typically require 50% more dust mass for the same level of extinction .",
    "similarly , the monte carlo radiative transfer simulations of bianchi et al ( 1999b ) , which assign dust clumps according to the distribution of molecular gas , indicate that homogeneous models , such as xad , will underestimate the dust mass by a factor of 2 for spiral galaxies viewed edge - on .",
    "we have attempted to assess the effects of clumping in ngc 891 ourselves , by estimating the amount of dust in gas clouds too optically thick to be detected satisfactorily by the xad homogeneous model .",
    "our reddest waveband is k , therefore our technique becomes insensitive to environments with @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) . within the galaxy",
    ", this corresponds to a column density @xmath90 of @xmath91 cm@xmath17 ( bohlin et al 1978 ) which is close to the column density within most giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) [ see for example larson ( 1981 ) , who found @xmath93 cm@xmath17 / @xmath94 for cloud sizes of @xmath95=0.05 - 100pc ] .",
    "it is possible , then , that we may ` miss ' a sizeable fraction of grains residing in gmcs . by comparing relative emission strengths detected from @xmath96co and @xmath97co molecules in various gas clouds , polk et al ( 1988 )",
    "estimate that 50% of molecular gas resides in galactic gmcs and the remainder constitutes a more diffuse medium surrounding gmcs .",
    "this information , then , suggests that the xad model will ` overlook ' about 50% of the h@xmath8 phase and , in total , perhaps 30% of grains associated with the ( hi+h@xmath8 ) gas phase of ngc 891 . since the submm is optically thin , any increase in the amount of dust inferred from extinction would decrease @xmath65 in eq .",
    "indeed , a 50 - 100% rise in @xmath42 , due to clumping , will yield a value of @xmath98 ",
    "@xmath99 for ngc 891 .",

    "the corresponding value for the solar neighborhood is 150 , where the dust mass is estimated from either stellar reddening or precipitation of grain elements from the gas phase ( spitzer 1978 ; whittet 1992 ) .",
    "sodroski et al ( 1994 ) analyzed the large - scale 140 and @xmath133 m from the galaxy , as detected by cobe , and thereby established a mean gas - to - dust ratio of 160 in the diffuse ism .",
    "very recently , a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 - 500 has been determined in several nearby galaxies using either radiation transfer modelling ( xilouris et al 1999 ; block et al 1994 ) or @xmath129 m iso imaging observations ( alton et al 1998b ) .",
    "our determination for ngc 891 is consistent with all these values given that sizeable uncertainties exist in the derived dust masses ( via the fir / submm emissivity ) and the quantity of molecular gas ( via the @xmath119 parameter ) .",
    "+ the total dust mass in ngc 891 , for that part of the disk covered by our scuba maps ( @xmath134 ) , is @xmath135 m@xmath136 .",
    "this is towards the low end of the range given in abr ( @xmath137 m@xmath136 ) .",
    "in this section , we attempt to establish the heavy element abundance along the disk of ngc 891 . a determination of metallicity may cause us to modify the value of @xmath119 , chosen in the previous section , to convert co line emission to h@xmath8 column density .",
    "since the gas - to - dust ratio , at least in the inner half of the disk , is dominated by the molecular rather than atomic gas , some justification for our chosen value of @xmath119 would seem in order . due to the obscuring effects of the ngc 891 dust lane , we resort to fir cooling lines from highly ionized metal species ( e.g.  oiii @xmath138 m ) which are expected to be optically thin even for a galaxy viewed edge - on .",
    "accordingly , we have searched the iso archive for long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) and short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) observations of ngc 891 and , although scientifically - validated spectra of several hii regions were procured , we could not relate the line strengths nor their ratios to any of the diagnostic models currently available in the literature ( statinska 1990 ; spinoglio & malkan 1992 ) .",
    "+ we then explored more indirect means of inferring the metallicity in ngc 891 .",
    "garnet ( 1998 ) has shown that there is a clear trend , spanning 4 magnitudes in b - band brightness , between relative oxygen abundance o / h and absolute galaxy luminosity @xmath139 ( see also garnett & shields 1987 ) .",
    "although extinction effects are severe in ngc 891 ( due to its edge - on orientation ) , the radiative transfer model of xad may be used to derive the intrinsic blue luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the object can then be located on the o / h vs.  @xmath139 plot of garnet . following garnet",
    ", we adopt @xmath140=50 km / s(mpc)@xmath18 in order to determine the distance modulus and hence absolute b magnitude of ngc 891 .",
    "thus , we derive a value of -21.0 for @xmath139 . on the garnet plot this corresponds to an oxygen abundance of 12+log(@xmath141)=9.2@xmath1420.2 at 1 b - band scale - length from the nucleus ( where 0.2 constitutes the dispersion in the metallicity - magnitude ` relation ' ) .",
    "the milky way has an o / h abundance of 9.1 at 1 b - band scale - length from the centre ( shaver et al 1983 ) , suggesting a very similar metallicity between ngc 891 and our own galaxy . + as mentioned in the previous section , we might expect to modify our value chosen for the conversion factor @xmath119 if the metallicity in ngc 891 falls below solar ( o / h=8.9 ) . for an average metallicity gradient of 0.08 dex / kpc in spiral disks ( vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ) , we expect the oxygen abundance to be 8.9@xmath1420.3 at the maximum radius at which we convert co line emission to h@xmath8 column density ( r=9.2 kpc ) .",
    "this suggests that the vast majority of molecular gas in ngc 891 has a heavy element abundance similar to , or indeed above , the solar level .",
    "thus the value of @xmath122 cm@xmath17 k",
    "km / s , generally adopted for the general ism inside the solar ring (  [ gdratio ] ) , can be used with some justification for ngc 891 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] , we reproduce the plot of issa et al ( 1990 ) showing the trend of increasing metallicity with higher dust - to - gas ratio for galaxies close to or in the local group .",
    "we incorporate the corresponding quantities derived for ngc 891 which , although subject to appreciable errors , show pleasing agreement with the correlation .",
    "part of the motivation for studying the dust content of external galaxies is to establish whether spiral disks are optically thick or essentially transparent to optical radiation .",
    "there exists a whole history of debate concerning the opacity of spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , various investigative techniques have produced quite disparate answers in the past ( davies & burstein 1995 ; valentijn 1990 ; disney et al 1989 ) .",
    "more recent studies seem to be in favour of a v - band optical depth @xmath143 through the centre of face - on disks ( xilouris et al 1999 ; kuchinski et al 1998 ) , although some authors still maintain spirals are optically thick right out to their @xmath112 ` edge ' ( valentijn 1990 ) .",
    "one reason why disk opacity is considered such an important topic is that we view the distant universe through , what amounts to , a foreground ` screen ' of spiral galaxies .",
    "this has the effect of both attenuating and reddening light emitted by high redshift systems .",
    "+ alton et al ( 1999b ) have begun to assess the impact of nearby dusty disks on observations of high redshift ( @xmath144 ) galaxies . for one of the disks which they had observed with iso ( ngc 6946 )",
    ", they adopted a bi - model grain distribution which followed the hi and h@xmath8 gas components according to a gas - to - dust ratio of 150 .",
    "this gave an extended dust disk , following the atomic gas , with an exponential fall - off of 14 kpc .",
    "combined with this was a compact grain component , tracing the h@xmath8 , with a radial exponential scale - length of 4.3 kpc .",
    "a simulation was run with a universe populated with disks of this parameterization and assuming a density for field spirals of @xmath145 per mpc@xmath146 ( loveday et al 1992 ) .",
    "although this constituted a rather simple model ( no account was taken of either galaxy clustering or a possible change in gas - to - dust ratio with look - back time ) it produced some instructive results .",
    "notably , for an einstein - de sitter cosmology and a value of 75 kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 for the hubble constant , alton et al ( 1999b ) predicted significant attenuation of light received in the b - band from high redshifts .",
    "indeed , they concluded that 30 - 40% of the light originating from @xmath147 would fail to reach the present - day observer due to intervening galactic disks .",
    "this attenuation arises principally from the extended dust component which is assumed to follow the atomic hydrogen .",
    "the scale - length and , indeed , total extent of this component is far more critical than the central optical depth associated with h@xmath8 because the peripheral regions of spirals occupy a relatively large filling factor in the plane of the sky . in the absence of information suggesting a radial cut - off for the dust disk ,",
    "none was applied for this simulation .",
    "+ ngc 6946 is a very gas - rich spiral galaxy ( tacconi & young 1990 ) and , as such , might produce somewhat misleading results when determining high - z visibility ( if we simply apply a constant gas - to - dust ratio ) .",
    "therefore , we wish to repeat the calculations of alton et al ( 1999b ) using the disk of ngc 891 as a model .",
    "we recognize that we will be basing our estimate on a single galaxy but it will be many years before the dust distribution has been accurately mapped out in a large number of nearby galaxies . thus provisionally , we use the information contained in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] regarding the gas - to - dust ratio along the major axis of ngc 891 .",
    "one component of dust is given a radial exponential scale - length of 3.9 kpc , so that it follows the distribution of h@xmath8 with a gas - to - dust ratio of 260 .",
    "we also prescribe a second grain component , with an exponential scale - length of 150 kpc .",
    "this traces the hi plateau with a gas - to - dust ratio of 350 .",
    "the maximum radial extent of both components is set at 14 kpc , the point at which the hi column density appears to drop off sharply in the 21 cm image of rupen et al ( 1991 ) .",
    "our calculation only considers field spirals ( using the density given by loveday et al 1992 ) , but allows for the fact that light received in the b - band , by the observer , has been affected by the uv - fuv part of the extinction curve at higher redshifts . for each slice in redshift ,",
    "the real density of spiral galaxies is calculated and , accordingly , their contribution to the optical depth at that redshift is determined .",
    "finally , we compute a covering factor , @xmath148 , which is defined as the fraction of light emitted at redshift @xmath144 which fails to reach a b - band observer due to the sum of intervening disks . this quantity will naturally vary according to our chosen cosmology but we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] our estimates for the important values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( h@xmath151=75 kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 ) .",
    "there is also a small dependance of the solution on the form chosen for the uv reddening law ( e.g.  galactic or lmc - type ) .",
    "however , this is generally neglible for @xmath152 . for more detail concerning our computation of @xmath148",
    "we refer to trewhella ( 1997 ) and heisler & ostriker ( 1988 ) which adopt a similar approach to the current method . + it is apparent from fig .  [ fig7 ]",
    "that , in general , foreground attenuation is not a significant problem for galaxies less than a redshift of 4 .",
    "indeed , for galaxies detected in the hubble deep field ( assuming typically @xmath144=1 - 2 here ) , less than 5% of the light appears to be lost . for quasars and related objects , at @xmath153 , small corrections are required in order to learn the true luminosity and colour from optical observations .",
    "these predictions rely heavily on the cut - off radius of the extended dust component ( assumed to follow the hi in the present calculation ) . when using the ngc 891 scuba data , we have extrapolated to @xmath154 , slightly beyond the furthest radius at which we detect @xmath0 m emission ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "submm observations at the optical edge of spiral galaxies are required to ascertain the true gas - to - dust ratio and opacity within the outer hi envelope .",
    "in contrast , we do not expect the obscuration calculations to be affected severely by our neglect of dust clumping .",
    "gmcs have an optical depth of @xmath156 whilst the diffuse ism is characterized by an optical depth close to unity .",
    "thus , for equal amounts of gas in the molecular and atomic phase , dust clumped into gmcs will occupy a filling factor of only 10% . as a point of reference , our opacity model for ngc 891 , if it were not truncated at @xmath154 , would give a face - on optical depth of @xmath157 at the @xmath112 ( @xmath158 ) .",

    "<S> we compare @xmath0 m scuba images of ngc 891 with the corresponding v - band optical depth predicted from radiation transfer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these two tracers of dust show a very similar distribution along the minor axis and a reasonable agreement along the major axis . assuming that the grains responsible for optical extinction are also the source of @xmath0 m emission we derive a submillimeter emissivity ( emission efficiency ) for dust in the ngc 891 disk . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is found to be a factor of 2 - 3 higher than the generally - accepted ( but highly uncertain ) values adopted for the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stated , however , that if a substantial fraction of dust in ngc 891 is clumped , the emissivity in the two galaxies may be quite similar . </S>",
    "<S> we use our newly - acquired emissivity to convert our @xmath0 m images into detailed maps of dust mass and , utilizing 21 cm and co - emission data for ngc 891 , derive the gas - to - dust ratio along the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we compute an average ratio of 260  a value consistent with the milky way and external spirals within the uncertainties in deriving both the dust mass and the quantity of molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of dust in ngc 891 appears to be closely associated with the molecular gas phase although it may start to follow the distribution of atomic hydrogen at radii @xmath19 kpc ( i.e.  @xmath2 ) . using the optical depth of the ngc 891 disk , we quantify how light emitted at high redshift is attenuated by dust residing in foreground spirals . for b - band observations of galaxies typically found in the hubble deep field , the amount of light lost is expected to be small ( @xmath3 5% ) </S>",
    "<S> this value depends critically on the maximum radial extent of cold dust in spiral disks ( which is poorly known ) . </S>",
    "<S> it may also represent a lower limit if galaxies expel dust over time into the intergalactic medium . </S>"
