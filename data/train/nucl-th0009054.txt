    "parity violation ( pv ) was discovered in 1956 in nuclear beta - decay by c.s .",

    "lee and c. n. yang @xcite . in 1960 ,",
    "zeldovich @xcite pointed out that pv should lead to parity - odd ( p - odd ) terms also in electron - hadron interactions .",
    "these are now considered as a manifestation of the electroweak interaction , whose properties are dictated by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "several p - odd observables have since been studied , in two types of pv experiments , namely in atomic physics @xcite ( at very low energy and momentum transfer ) and in electron scattering ( at relatively high energies and non - zero momentum transfers ) .    at first",
    ", these experiments were aiming at testing the sm and measuring the weinberg angle .",
    "a pioneering experiment was performed at slac on a deuterium target @xcite , followed 10 years later by experiments at mainz on @xmath21be @xcite and bates on @xmath22c @xcite .",
    "their determination of the weinberg angle were confirmed later on , within their stated accuracy of 10% , by high energy experiments . since @xmath23 is now known to three decimal places [ @xmath24 @xcite , the emphasis of e - p scattering today , is to make use of the sm to learn about the internal structure of the nucleon .    until recently",
    ", it has been assumed that the nucleon was only made of u and d valence or sea quarks , but there are indications that the nucleon carries also hidden strangeness :    * the sigma - term ( deduced from the pion - nucleon scattering length ) is very different from the theoretical value calculated within the chiral perturbation theory ( which is a realization of the sm at low energy ) , indicating that @xmath25 of the nucleon mass might be carried out by strange quarks @xcite , * experiments of polarized deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) of leptons show that up to 10 - 20@xmath26 of the nucleon spin could be carried by strange quarks @xcite , * elastic scattering of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos by protons can only be explained by taking into account strange quarks in the nucleon @xcite , * a natural explanation of the strong violation of the ozi - rule in @xmath27 annihilation @xcite and of @xmath28- production @xcite or @xmath29-meson production @xcite in nucleon - nucleon interactions takes into account a nucleon ( antinucleon ) strange sea .",
    "these experiments are sensitive to various aspects of nucleon structure : for example , the sigma - term and the results of @xmath30 or @xmath31 experiments are sensitive to the scalar part of the hadronic current , polarized dis and elastic scattering of neutrinos ( or anti - neutrinos ) by protons are sensitive to the vector - axial current . in this respect , pv in electron - nucleon scattering seems the most attractive way of measuring the _ strange _ vector current , thanks to a clean theoretical interpretation through the sm .    the sample collaboration at mit - bates , has measured pv asymmetries in @xmath32 elastic scattering at @xmath2= 0.1 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the four - momentum transfer squared ) and large angle @xcite , which allowed them to obtain the first experimental determination of the weak magnetic form - factor of the proton . from this measurement and the knowledge of the proton and neutron electromagnetic form - factors ,",
    "one could extract a strange magnetic form - factor = @xmath36 .",
    "note that most calculations based on qcd or quark models predict negative values for ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another experiment , done by the happex collaboration at jefferson lab,@xcite has done a measurement at 2= 0.48 @xmath33 and small scattering angle @xmath37 where the sensitivity to the weak electric form factor is enhanced . here",
    "the measured asymmetry @xmath38 is consistent with the sm prediction in the absence of components in the nucleon sea . from this asymmetry",
    ", one can deduce the following contribution to the strange form - factor : @xmath39 compatible with zero within the error bars .",
    "these results have stimulated a strong interest and many predictions , for both and , have been published , whether within quark models @xcite , chiral perturbation theories @xcite or lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "these calculations predict that while is essentially constant as a function of 2 , may vary rapidly .",
    "they also indicate that there might be some cancellation between and which are predicted of different signs .",
    "therefore new e - p experiments are being set up in order to check these predictions : at @xmath40 ( gev / c)@xmath41 at mainz@xcite , at @xmath2 = 0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath41 and forward angles by the happex collaboration in order to do a rosenbluth separation of and in combination with the sample results , and finally a full separation of and in the momentum transfer range @xmath2 = 0.12 - 1.0 ( gev / c)@xmath41 is foreseen by the 0 collaboration at jefferson lab @xcite .    it should be stressed that , due to their present high level of precision and their firm theoretical basis , pv experiments can also be used to answer other important physics questions , besides the existence of a possible component in the nucleon .",
    "let s mention for example :    @xmath42 search and test for new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "such effects could manifest themselves through , e.g. extra @xmath43-bosons ( heavier than the standard 0 ) or leptoquarks indicating that there are substructures common to both leptons and quarks .",
    "the use of the 0 experimental set - up for such studies is being discussed @xcite ,    @xmath42 study of the axial part of the hadronic weak neutral current : it has been shown that , for the special case of a @xmath44 , @xmath45 spin - isospin transition ( @xmath9-excitation ) , there is a particular sensitivity to , the axial - vector transition form - factor which could be determined independently of pcac and free of uncertainties from extrapolation of low energy theorems @xcite ,    @xmath42 measurement of the neutron charge form - factor @xcite .",
    "the reactions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are of practical interest for experimentalists as they may contaminate the elastic peak .",
    "it is therefore important to determine their own asymmetries since , if they are much larger than or , even , of different sign from the elastic one , they might be a source of errors or large uncertainties .    in 3-body reactions",
    ", besides the weak pv asymmetries , there are also strong ( parity - conserving ) interactions , due to the so - called @xmath48 response function @xcite , which are generally much larger ( of the order of @xmath49 instead of @xmath50 ) than pv asymmetries but which cancel in inclusive reactions or when detectors have an azimuthal symmetry .    pion production has been studied previously @xcite in quasi 2-body models with stable @xmath9 isobar .",
    "a more complete calculation including background ( born ) terms with pseudoscalar @xmath4 coupling with the @xmath9 treated as a rarita - schwinger field with phenomenological @xmath4 electromagnetic transition currents can be found in @xcite .    in the present study , we calculate pv asymmetries in inclusive @xmath51 electroproduction , starting from threshold up to the @xmath9-region in an approach similar to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , but differing in the following aspects :    * the main improvement consists in including @xmath12- and @xmath11-exchange in the @xmath52-channel for @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is a virtual photon or boson ) , * we use a different parametrization for the @xmath9 contribution , and slightly different values of mass and width , * crossing symmetries are treated differently ( and less accurately ) than in ref @xcite , * we use a pseudoscalar @xmath55 interaction in order to identify possible off - mass - shell effects .",
    "two remarkable results were found in the calculations of ref.@xcite , for which no explanation or discussion was given : * * the full ( background + resonance ) asymmetry a does not depend on the total energy of the hadronic system , although the separate terms show strong ( and opposite ) variations , * * @xmath56 is , to a good approximation , a linear function of 2 .",
    "the present work agrees with these features .",
    "moreover it gives a physical explanation to them as it shows that there is a specific parametrization of the asymmetry which allows to separate the main ( isovector ) contribution in a model independent way .",
    "this contribution only depends on the fermi constant @xmath57 , the fine structure constant @xmath58 and @xmath23",
    ". therefore its dependence on the kinematics can be predicted exactly .",
    "small corrections to the main contribution , due to the isoscalar part of the neutral vector and axial currents can then be calculated and their physical importance assessed .",
    "we shall consider here the processes @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a nucleon ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 is a pion ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) .",
    "we take into account two standard mechanisms , @xmath65 and @xmath66 boson exchanges ( fig .",

    "but the existing experimental data about pion photo and electro - production of pions on the nucleons ( in the @xmath9 resonance region ) indicate that the @xmath315 term is dominant @xcite , therefore in our analysis we will consider only this form factor .    using expressions ( [ eq : eq34 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq35 ] ) for both the @xmath318 and @xmath319 vertices",
    ", one can write the matrix element of the @xmath295contribution in the @xmath10channel ( fig .",
    "2e ) as follows : @xmath320 where @xmath321 and @xmath322 are the mass and width of @xmath9 and @xmath323 is proportional to the magnetic form factor of the @xmath314 transition .    the following @xmath9 contributions to the scalar amplitudes , @xmath324 can be derived : @xmath325 @xmath326 @xmath327 @xmath328 where we use the notation : @xmath329 the role of the factor @xmath330 is to correctly describe the threshold behavior of the @xmath315 amplitude for @xmath331 , according to the p - wave nature of the produced pion .",
    "we shall use the following formula for the @xmath125-dependence of the transition electromagnetic form factors : @xmath332 the factor @xmath333 , with @xmath334 gev@xmath41 , is included in order to take into account a steeper decreasing of @xmath323 in comparison with the dipole behavior of the elastic electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "+ the normalization constant @xmath335 can be found according to the following procedure .",
    "( [ eq : eq36 ] ) , let us calculate first the differential cross section for @xmath0-photoproduction : @xmath336 at @xmath337 , where the @xmath9-excitation in the @xmath10channel is the main mechanism .",
    "so , our parametrization of the @xmath9-contribution describes correctly the angular dependence @xmath338 , typical for the magnetic excitation of a @xmath339 state in @xmath340 .",
    "therefore , the total cross section can be written as : @xmath341 where : @xmath342 @xmath343 we can approximate with a good accuracy @xmath344 by a single @xmath295resonance contribution . for a numerical estimate of",
    "@xmath335 we use @xmath345 cm@xmath41 .",
    "note again that this procedure can not determine the sign of @xmath335 .",
    "however for the @xmath347 reaction , there is a strong interference between the pion diagram and the @xmath295contribution .",
    "the comparison of the calculations using different signs with the experimental @xmath348-dependence in the resonance region allows to fix the corresponding relative sign .",
    "two remarks should be done about this procedure :    * there is no ambiguity concerning off - mass shell effects for the @xmath9-contribution , at least in the @xmath10channel , * this special contribution is gauge invariant .",
    "we neglect in our consideration the @xmath9-exchange in the @xmath349channel . the main reason to include this contribution is to have the crossing symmetry of the model .",
    "this is in principle an important property of the photoproduction amplitude , in particular in connection with the dispersion relation approach .",
    "however in the framework of phenomenological approaches , this symmetry is strongly violated .",
    "for example , the @xmath10channel @xmath295 contribution induces an amplitude which is mostly complex ( with a typical breit - wigner behavior ) , whereas the @xmath196-channel contribution results in a real amplitude .",
    "the inclusion of different form factors for the @xmath10 and @xmath349channel violates the crossing symmetry , which is important for the born contributions .",
    "this appears clearly for the reaction @xmath163 , because here the crossing symmetry is correlated with the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic interaction , and the violation of the crossing symmetry has for direct consequence the violation of the current conservation . on the contrary , for the @xmath9-contribution",
    ", this important correlation is absent .",
    "having determined all the parameters of the model , it is possible in principle to calculate all observables for the processes @xmath87 ( on proton and neutron targets ) in the kinematical region from threshold to the @xmath9-resonance region ( @xmath350 mev ) , for any value of the pion production angle , @xmath351 , ( in the cms of the @xmath4-system , ) and of the four momentum transfer @xmath125 .    in order to test the present model , we used existing experimental data on the angular dependence of the differential cross sections for both the @xmath163 and @xmath347 reactions .",
    "this comparison allowed to fix empirically the relative sign of the different contributions : born , @xmath9-excitation ( in the @xmath10channel ) and vector meson exchange ( in the @xmath13 channel ) .",
    "the relative sign of all three diagrams for the born approximation in the case of the process @xmath347 are fixed by gauge invariance , but it is necessary to find the relative signs between the born amplitudes , on one side , and the @xmath9-isobar and vector meson exchange contributions , on another side .",
    "the @xmath347 reaction is more sensitive to the signs of the @xmath9-contribution and @xmath352-exchange .",
    "then the data about the differential cross sections for @xmath163 allow a further check and give a constrain for the @xmath353exchange amplitude .",
    "note that the sign of the @xmath208exchange contribution relative to the born contribution ( in both the @xmath163 and @xmath354 reactions ) has to be the same as the relative sign of meson exchange currents ( due to the @xmath355 meson - exchange mechanism in the calculation of the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron ) with respect to the amplitude in the impulse approximation for elastic @xmath356scattering .",
    "this represents an important link between very different physical problems .    in order to obtain a good description of the experimental data for @xmath357 and @xmath347 we introduced small corrections to the different contributions . for the reaction @xmath163 a form factor",
    "was added to the born contribution . the @xmath349channel nucleon contribution for @xmath347",
    "can be neglected without violating gauge invariance , because its magnetic content satisfies alone the current conservation condition . as a matter of fact this contribution",
    "has a diverging behavior at large angle , which is typically corrected by introducing an _ ad - hoc _ form factor .",
    "we choose to replace this contribution with a somewhat simplified phenomenological ( s - wave like ) contribution : @xmath358 where @xmath359 is a parameter which is adjusted in order to reproduce at best the @xmath0 photoproduction data .",
    "we did not attempt to reproduce with a good accuracy the threshold behavior of the @xmath163 and @xmath347 amplitudes . a precise description of this behavior , in particular for the process @xmath163 ,",
    "can be obtained , for example , in the framework of the chiral perturbative theory approach @xcite . for inclusive calculations ,",
    "a qualitative description of the data in the threshold region is sufficient .",
    "the quality of our model is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where we present the comparison of our predictions with the experimental data on the differential cross sections for the @xmath163 and @xmath347 reactions , in the kinematical region where our model can be considered a reasonable approach . indeed",
    "the unpolarized differential cross sections are well described .",
    "we did not apply the model to polarization observables . in particular different @xmath360odd observables , such as , for example , the target asymmetry or the polarization of the final nucleons , are very sensitive to the relative phases of the different contributions . a good description requires a very precise treatment of the unitarity condition as well as of t - invariance of the hadron electromagnetic interaction , which are not so important for the differential or total cross section .",
    "therefore , after having determined the relative signs of the different contributions , our model can be generalized to pion electroproduction .",
    "our aim is the calculation of the inclusive p - odd asymmetry @xmath119 , in @xmath361 , for the sum of two possible channels , @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "one can see , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq25 ] ) , that such asymmetry is determined by the following ratios of inclusive cross sections : @xmath364 for both channels , @xmath133 and @xmath132 , and @xmath365 which characterizes the relative role of the two channels .",
    "the 2-dimensional plots of these ratios as functions of @xmath125 and @xmath3 are shown in fig . 4 and 5 , for the reactions @xmath133 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath0-electroproduction , both @xmath366 and @xmath367 are small corrections to @xmath119 . in the considered kinematical region , they are positive and tend to decrease in the region of the @xmath9 resonance , due to the dominance of the isovector resonance contribution .",
    "the behavior of all these ratios in the threshold region can be improved , as we discussed above .    in the case of the @xmath132 reaction ,",
    "the corresponding corrections are also small , especially @xmath366 .",
    "note that @xmath367 is negative in the whole region of @xmath125 and @xmath3 .",
    "combining these results it is possible to calculate the resulting asymmetry @xmath119 for the sum of both channels , again in a 2-dimensional representation ( fig .",
    "the dependence on the detailed electron kinematics for @xmath361 ( energies of the initial and final electron and electron scattering angle ) is contained in the single parameter @xmath164 , for which we used three different values : @xmath368 and 1 . in order to extract the strong @xmath125 dependence of @xmath119 , the `` reduced '' asymmetry @xmath369 is shown .    in this picture",
    "one can see that the behavior of @xmath119 versus @xmath125 and @xmath3 , in the region @xmath370 gev and in a wide region of momentum transfer @xmath125 , is smooth everywhere and negative ( note the @xmath371 factor in the formula ) .",
    "such a behavior results from the isovector nature of the electroproduction processes which we have considered .    the role of the different contributions is illustrated in figs . 7 , 8 and 9 . in fig .",
    "7 ( fig . 8)",
    "the ratio of the cross sections @xmath366 and @xmath367 is reported as a function of w , for two fixed values of @xmath372 , ( a ) @xmath373 and ( b ) @xmath374 ( gev / c)@xmath41 , for the reaction @xmath133 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 contribution ( dashed - dotted line ) vanishes , while the born terms ( dotted line ) give the largest contribution at forward angles .",
    "the contribution given by the vector meson ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) exchange diagrams is not so essential here .",
    "the different contributions to the total asymmetry a are shown in fig .",
    "9 is a projection of fig .",
    "6 showing the resulting reduced asymmetries @xmath369 as a function of @xmath3 at a fixed value of the virtual photon polarization @xmath375 and for two values of the momentum transfer ( a ) @xmath373 ( gev / c)@xmath41 ; ( b ) @xmath374 ( gev / c)@xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath9-contribution only is constant as a function of @xmath3 due to its isovector dominance , the vector - meson exchange gives a rather small contribution at low @xmath3 ( below 1.2 @xmath376 ) and it is negligible above .",
    "the full calculation gives values of a varying smoothly from @xmath377 at @xmath3=1.1 gev ( close to the elastic region ) to @xmath378 at @xmath3=1.25 gev , in the region of the @xmath9 at @xmath379 ( gev / c)@xmath41 .",
    "one purpose of the present paper is to give an estimate of a possible contamination of the elastic peak by @xmath64-production and to assess its effect on the measured asymmetry .",
    "although a detailed comparison of elastic and inelastic channels can only be made for specific geometries at the same incident energies and scattering angles ( or equivalently , same @xmath125 and @xmath164 ) , a rough estimate can be made using inclusive cross - sections .",
    "weak asymmetries have been calculated in the standard weinberg - salam model assuming no strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "the results depend on the electromagnetic form factors for protons and neutrons , and give therefore different predictions depending on which values are taken .",
    "calculations of ref.@xcite give @xmath380 , at @xmath372=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath41 up to @xmath381 , at @xmath372=0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath41 for @xmath382= 2 gev .",
    "the sample collaboration @xcite has measured @xmath383 at @xmath372=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath41 and backward angle .",
    "weak asymmetry calculations have been done for the @xmath20 @xcite , pva4-mainz @xcite and happex @xcite experimental conditions , predicting values ranging from @xmath384 at @xmath372=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath41 to @xmath385 at @xmath372=0.5 ( gev / c)@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "as one can see all calculations agree to predict negative asymmetries except one @xcite where small positive values have been obtained in an extension of the sm when taking right - handed doublets of @xmath52 and @xmath386 quarks into account ( in this early paper , @xmath387 is taken equal to 1/3 ) .",
    "note that one can also find in this paper a simple explanation of the negative sign of the asymmetry in terms of @xmath5 coupling to quarks and leptons .    now comparing elastic scattering and inclusive @xmath64-production ( fig .",
    "9 ) , we see that they are both negative and of the same order of magnitude .",
    "moreover @xmath56 is smaller in the region @xmath3=1.1 gev ( close to elastic scattering ) and larger in the @xmath297 region .",
    "therefore we can conclude that a small admixture of @xmath64-production events in the region of the elastic peak , is not going to produce a large uncertainty in the elastic pv asymmetry .",
    "specific cases can be computed using fig . 6 or from the corresponding numerical values available from the authors .",
    "we have derived the dependence of the p - odd asymmetry for inclusive scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons by unpolarized protons with production of neutral and positive pions @xmath388 , with @xmath362 or @xmath363 . using the known isotopic properties of the electromagnetic current for the @xmath133 and @xmath132 processes and the vector part of the hadronic weak neutral current for the @xmath389 and @xmath390 processes , we derived an original expression for the inclusive asymmetry @xmath119 . without approximations , it is possible to disentangle the main contribution to @xmath119 , which depends only on @xmath125 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath119 is then reduced to the analysis of specific isoscalar contributions to the electromagnetic currents .",
    "such contributions appear , then , as corrections to the main term , which can be calculated exactly .",
    "we have calculated the amplitudes for @xmath212 , taking into account three standard contributions : born+vector meson exchange+ @xmath9-excitation .",
    "all the necessary parameters : interaction constants and different electromagnetic form factors are taken from other sources .",
    "small adjustements in this basic approach were done in order to obtain a good description of the differential cross section data for the @xmath163 and @xmath347 reactions .",
    "the model gives the vector part of the hadronic weak neutral current which is the main contribution to p - odd effects in @xmath391 .",
    "the reduced weak asymmetry @xmath392 varies very little as a function of the two basic kinematical variables , @xmath125 and @xmath3 . in our approach",
    "this appears naturally from the fact that the isoscalar content of the electromagnetic current for @xmath393 is very small in the considered kinematical region .",
    "it is of the same sign and size as the @xmath394 elastic pv asymmetry , and will , therefore , not much contribute to the experimental uncertainty of the former .",

    "<S> parity violating asymmetry in inclusive scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons by unpolarized protons with @xmath0 or @xmath1 meson production , is calculated as a function of the momentum transfer squared @xmath2 and the total energy @xmath3 of the @xmath4-system . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry , which is induced by the interference of the one - photon exchange amplitude with the parity - odd part of the @xmath5-exchange amplitude , is calculated for the @xmath6 processes ( @xmath7 is a virtual photon and @xmath8 a virtual z - boson ) considering the @xmath9-contribution in the @xmath10channel , the standard born contributions and vector meson ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) exchanges in the @xmath13channel . taking into account the known isotopic properties of the hadron electromagnetic and neutral currents , we show that the p - odd term is the sum of two contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the main term is model independent and it can be calculated exactly in terms of fundamental constants . </S>",
    "<S> it is found to be linear in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term is a relatively small correction which is determined by the isoscalar component of the electromagnetic current . near threshold and in the @xmath9-region , </S>",
    "<S> this isoscalar part is much smaller ( in absolute value ) than the isovector one : its contribution to the asymmetry depend on the polarization state ( longitudinal or transverse ) of the virtual photon .    </S>",
