    "cocompactness is a property of continuous embeddings between two banach spaces , defined as follows .",
    "[ def : coco ] let @xmath0 be a reflexive banach space continuously embedded into a banach space @xmath1 .",
    "the embedding @xmath2 is called cocompact relative to a group @xmath3 of bijective isometries on @xmath0 if every sequence @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 for any choice of @xmath6 , converges to zero in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , a compact embedding is cocompact relative to the trivial group @xmath7 ( and therefore to any other group of isometries ) , but the converse is generally false . in this note",
    "we study embedding of the sobolev space @xmath8 , defined as the completion of @xmath9 with respect to the gradient norm @xmath10 , @xmath11 , into the lebesgue space @xmath12 .",
    "this embedding is not compact , but it is cocompact relative to the rescaling group ( see below ) .",
    "an elementary example of a cocompact embedding that is not compact , due to jaffard @xcite , is the embedding of @xmath13 into itself , which is cocompact relative to the group of shifts @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath15 for any choice of @xmath16 .",
    "choose a component @xmath17 of @xmath18 so that @xmath19 . then , applying the sequence @xmath20 we have @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , this type of argument can be used to prove cocompactness of any embedding , where the spaces involved have an unconditional wavelet basis associated with the group , as it is indeed done in @xcite for fractional sobolev spaces , and in @xcite for besov and triebel - lizorkin spaces .",
    "cocompactness is a tool widely used ( often without being referred to by any name , or else as  vanishing lemma  or ",
    "inverse embedding  ) for proving convergence of functional sequences , in particular in calculus of variations .",
    "cocompactness property implicitly underlies the concentration compactness method of p .-",
    "lions , but it is important to stress that the latter was developed for particular function spaces , while cocompactness argument is functional - analytic , and its applications extend beyond the concentration phenomena ( see @xcite ) . the earliest cocompactness result known to the author is the proof by e.  lieb @xcite of cocompactness of embedding of the inhomogenous sobolev space @xmath22 into @xmath23 , @xmath24 , relative to the group of shifts @xmath25 ( which is an easy consequence of the cocompactness result discussed here ) .",
    "we refer the reader to a survey @xcite of known cocompact embeddings for function spaces .",
    "the purpose of this note is to complement that survey of results with four different proofs of cocompactness for sobolev embeddings .",
    "we generalize the second and the fourth proofs found in literature for the case @xmath26 to general @xmath27 , and the fourth proof is shortened in comparison to the original version by means of referring to a known inequality .",
    "the third and the fourth proofs can be easily extended ti embeddings of besov and tribel - lizorkin spaces , as it is done in , respectively @xcite and ( to our best knowledge ) @xcite .",
    "cocompactness property plays crucial role in describing the  blow - up `` structure of sequences . in presence of a @xmath3-cocompact embedding @xmath2 ,",
    "any bounded sequence in @xmath0 , under suitable additional conditions , has a subsequence consisting of asymptotically decoupled ' ' bubbles  of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , plus a remainder that vanishes in the norm of @xmath1 .",
    "existence of such decomposition was first proved by solimini @xcite for the sobolev embedding @xmath31 , generalized by several subsequent papers to other spaces of sobolev type , to more general groups , as well as to strichartz spaces ( see survey @xcite ) , extended to general hilbert spaces in @xcite , and to general banach spaces in @xcite .",
    "the latter work , however , uses a related , but different , property of delta - cocompactness , which can be formulated by replacing the weak convergence in the statement of definition  1.1 with delta - convergence of t.  c.  lim @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a metric space .",
    "one says a sequence @xmath32 has a delta - limit @xmath33 if for any @xmath34 there is a sequence of real numbers @xmath35 , such that @xmath36    delta - convergence and weak convergence coincide in hilbert spaces , but not in general banach spaces .",
    "delta - convergence is , however , dependent on a norm , and in separable spaces one can always find an equivalent norm , relative to which delta - convergence coincides with weak convergence ( van dulst , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , for besov and triebel - lizorkin ( including sobolev ) spaces , such equivalent norm exists while it also remains invariant with respect to the rescaling group , defined via the littlewood - paley decomposition ( @xcite , definition 2 in chapter 5 ) , see cwikel , @xcite .",
    "thus , in the context of spaces of sobolev type , there is no need to consider delta - cocompactness as a property distinct from cocompactness .",
    "we do not include here the case @xmath37 , because the natural extension of the notion of cocompactness to a non - reflexive space would invoke the weak - star convergence , which is not defined on @xmath38 .",
    "instead one may regard @xmath39 as a closed isometric subspace of the space of functions of bounded variation , and prove cocompactness of the embedding @xmath40 for @xmath41 , as it is done in @xcite .",
    "the proof here is an adaptation of the second proof in this note that takes into account a different chain rule for functions of bounded variation .",
    "a larger collection of cocompact embeddings can be produced by restricting homogeneous functional spaces to their subspaces , in particular to inhomogenous sobolev spaces . in presence of additional symmetries , such as radial symmetry",
    ", cocompactness may even yield compact embedding , such as in the case of subspaces of radial functions . for details on derived cocompact embeddings",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 and let @xmath43 with @xmath44 . on either of @xmath8 and @xmath45 , @xmath11 , this deffines a group of ( bijective ) linear isometries , often called the rescalings group . in",

    "we give four different proofs of the following statement .",
    "[ thm1 ] the sobolev embedding @xmath31 , @xmath11 , is cocompact relative to the rescsaling group @xmath47 .",
    "it could be possible also to furnish a proof based on atomic decomposition ( for definition see @xcite ) , characterization of the norm in @xmath48 in terms of the atomic coefficients , and the inequality , but given that the atomic decomposition is derived from the littelwood - paley decomposition , such proof would be too repetitive of the fourth proof here .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath49 and @xmath50 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we will denote an open ball of radius @xmath51 centered at @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "we will use the following notations for the conjugate exponent and the critical exponent , resoectively : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",

    "the norm of the usual lebesgue space @xmath58 , identified with the lorentz space @xmath59 , will be denoted as @xmath60 .",
    "the proof below is given by sergio solimini in @xcite , section 2 .",
    "cocompactness in @xmath31 is derived there from cocompactness in the embedding into the larger space , @xmath61 , whose equivalent norm , due to the original characterization of the space by marcinkiewicz , is @xmath62 the proof needs the following auxilliary statement .",
    "[ s1 ] let @xmath63 , and let @xmath64 there exist @xmath65 such that for every @xmath63 every @xmath66 ,    @xmath67    it suffices to prove ( [ eq : s1 ] ) for @xmath68 .",
    "writing the function @xmath69 in polar coordinates @xmath70 centered at a point @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 integrating with respect to @xmath73 over the unit sphere we easily arrive at @xmath74 inequality ( [ eq : s1 ] ) follows then immediately by applying young inequality for convolutions , once we note that the @xmath75-norm of the restriction of @xmath76 to @xmath77 is a multiple of @xmath51",
    ".    we can now prove theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "\\1 . it suffices to prove cocompactness of the embedding @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , there is a continuous embedding @xmath78 ( expressed by the well - known hardy inequality ) , and from application of hlder inequality to the definition of lorentz quasinorm one has @xmath79 thus any sequence bounded in @xmath8 and vanishing in @xmath80 will also vanish in @xmath45 .",
    "consider a bounded sequence @xmath81 which does not converge to zero in the norm of @xmath82 . passing to a renamed subsequence",
    ", we may assume that @xmath83 for some @xmath84 .",
    "then , by definition of the marcinkiewicz norm , there exist a sequence of measurable sets @xmath85 such that @xmath86   let us choose integers @xmath87 so that the measure of the sets @xmath88 falls into the interval @xmath89 $ ] and let @xmath90 .",
    "note that @xmath91 , and @xmath92   from lemma  [ s1 ] it now follows that there exists a @xmath63 such that @xmath93 comparing the last two relations and using the triangle inequality we have @xmath94 and thus there exist points @xmath95 such that @xmath96 in other words , @xmath97 this implies that @xmath98 does not converge weakly to zero , or , in terms of the original sequence , @xmath99 does not converge weakly to zero .",
    "this contradiction proves that the embedding of @xmath8 into @xmath100 is cocompact , and , subsequebntly , the embedding @xmath31 is cocompact .",
    "cocompactness of the embedding @xmath101 for @xmath102 is also proved by lemma  5.10 in @xcite , and its argument can be easily modified for general @xmath103 giving another proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
