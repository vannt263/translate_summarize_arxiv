    "the role of time - scales is crucial for understanding the validity of equilibrium techniques to any physical process since fast degrees of freedom ( time - scale @xmath0 ) generally reach their stationary distribution well within the experiment s duration but the same can not be assumed about slow ones ( time - scale @xmath1 ) .",
    "for instance , glasses are a very important class of systems presenting slow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for the slow degrees of freedom depends on the system s preparation and also on the elapsed time interval , i.e. , for how long the system has aged  @xcite . for the time interval @xmath2",
    ", the system behaves as driven by an effective external slow field associated with the slow variables .",
    "however , there is no physical reason for the slow and fast fluctuations distribution to match , so , in general , @xmath3 .",
    "in this case , the reduced form for the fast variable s distribution is an instantaneous equilibrium one  @xcite . for longer times , @xmath4 , the distributions for all variables ( fast and slow )",
    "reach a stationary state . for closed systems governed by a microscopic hamiltonian",
    ", the stationary state will be a true equilibrium one .",
    "for open systems in contact with a single thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath5 , the final state will also be the equilibrium distribution .",
    "however , by subjecting a system to simultaneous contacts with two ( or more ) reservoirs at distinct temperatures , say @xmath6 and @xmath7 , it will reach a stationary state distinct from the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "in consequence , the stationary state will depend on the properties of system - reservoir interactions and the reservoirs temperatures .",
    "simple models presenting these characteristics , such as brownian particles ( bp ) , have been used to explore the physics of slow dynamics and glasses  @xcite .    the complete description of bp is given by its microscopic interactions with a heat bath of lighter particles as well as the interactions with the external environment .",
    "trying to evaluate the macroscopic behavior starting up from a microscopic model presents an impossible task .",
    "however , for many physical systems we can often reduce the number of important variables down to a manageable set , thanks to well separated time - scales  @xcite allowing us to eliminate the fast variables of the problem . the effect of the eliminated variables is taken into account by means of a random forcing term on the equations of motion for the remaining variables  @xcite and by suitable friction coefficients . the random term ( noise function )",
    "represents the effect of the collisions of the bp with the heat baths s particles . in the case",
    "these thermal forces vary on a very short time - scale , their effect can be represented by uncorrelated collisions ( white noise ) and the bp motion can be analyzed in a simple way because its stochastic dynamics can be treated as a markovian process . finally , its long term behavior is well described by a boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium  @xcite . however , for many realistic brownian processes in dense fluids the short time - scale approximation for the random forces may not be accurate , since the time - intervals of the microscopic collisions might overlap .",
    "instead , we need to consider that those forces act upon the bp during a well defined time - scale , or colored noise . also , the presence of excited large - scale hydrodynamic modes will affect the bp by long time - scale feed - back loops  @xcite that can be accounted for by a dissipative memory function term in the langevin - like equation describing the brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "our present goal is to obtain the long - time stationary state for a bp system , subjected to contacts with two different heat baths at distinct temperatures , that is simple enough to be treated exactly but sophisticated enough to present the non - trivial stationary properties discussed above  @xcite .    in our model",
    ", it is possible to keep the bp from reaching the bg equilibrium by simultaneously subjecting it to the influence of two thermal baths at different temperatures @xmath6 and @xmath7 , one acts as heat source while the other acts as a heat sink . as for the bp simultaneously subjected to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the stationary state will depend on the details of the interaction between the baths and the bp and the effective temperature will be an intermediary one between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as will be shown .",
    "even if temperature gradients are not present , the stationary distribution for velocities and positions will differ from the bg measure , reducing to it only when the temperatures are the same , @xmath8 .",
    "this simple model has been proposed to describe the behavior of glasses  @xcite where one assumes different time - scales for each thermal bath , via their noise properties : the short time - scale white noise reproduces thermal relaxation whereas the long time - scale noise reproduces very slow , correlated , structural rearrangement of the glass .",
    "additionally , in our approach we can include the effects related to the finite mass of the particle in stationary state , as well as other effects associated with the slow noise  @xcite which are often neglected by other methods based on the over - damped limit calculations ( which corresponds to the limit @xmath9 ) .",
    "for instance , the bp adjusts itself to the slow noise function as  @xcite , specially when its mass can be neglected ( over - damped case ) , and the position distribution becomes very similar to a true equilibrium form , given that the slow noise acts like an external effective potential  @xcite .",
    "however , this simplification eliminates the contribution of the fast noise for the stationary distribution  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our time - averaging scheme will integrate that small effect for a very long time and exhibit the missing contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model . in section iii",
    "we calculate the time - averaging integrals obtaining the displacement and velocity non - vanishing terms . in sections",
    "iv and v , we obtain the stationary ( or equilibrium ) distribution and discuss our main results .",
    "let s consider a massive brownian particle ( bp ) moving under the action of a confining potential @xmath10 , which is in contact with two heat baths of distinct temperatures and time - scales , expressed by the noise functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are some interesting physical systems that present this kind of multiple time - scale phenomena .",
    "for instance , in glasses the short time - scale ( fast ) modes are associated with thermal vibrations and the long time - scale ( slow ) ones with structural reorganization of the atomic structure  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the fast modes on the bp are represented by the white noise term @xmath12 , associated with the heat bath at temperature @xmath6 and the instantaneous friction coefficient @xmath13 . on the other hand , the slow modes contribution",
    "are represented by a colored noise term @xmath11 , associated with the heat bath at temperature @xmath7 ( in general @xmath14 ) .",
    "these modes give rise to long - time feed - back loops that are expressed by the integration of a frictional memory function @xmath15 over time .",
    "this is modeled by two coupled stochastic differential equations : @xmath16 @xmath17 where the properties of the terms above are discussed in the following .",
    "we assume @xmath18 for simplicity .",
    "the stochastic process described by eq.([eq.02 ] ) is non - markovian due to the noise @xmath19 be time correlated with a well defined time - scale @xmath20 and exponential time - correlation function , or a colored noise ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it represents the slow dynamics and only at time - scales much larger than @xmath20 will @xmath19 manifest markovian behavior .",
    "the noise @xmath21 is a white one and represents the fast dynamics .",
    "both noises , fast and slow , are gaussian and can be defined in terms of their two lowest cumulants .",
    "let s start with the slow noise properties :    @xmath22    @xmath23    giving the memory function  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath20 is the characteristic time - scale of the slow noise , @xmath7 its temperature and @xmath25 a dissipative strength associated with @xmath19 .",
    "the units are chosen so that boltzmann s constant is equal to one ( @xmath26 ) .    the first two cumulants for the fast noise are given below : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath6 is the temperature and @xmath13 is the dissipative coefficient for the fast noise .",
    "our goal is to find out the exact stationary solution for eq.([eq.02 ] ) through the time - averaging of @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the solutions for a given set of bp s initial conditions @xmath33 and for a given realization of the stochastic processes @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we need to take the average over these last two stochastic processes in order to obtain the stationary solution .",
    "thus , the stationary distribution for the brownian degrees of freedom reads  @xcite : @xmath34    for simplicity , we will assume that the initial conditions are @xmath35 , since the terms depending on the initial conditions tend to zero as @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the centerpiece of our method is to use laplace transforms in order to make our problem manageable and the mathematical reason for doing so is because eq.([eq.08 ] ) itself is the laplace transformation of the averaged density .",
    "thus , our goal is to describe the stationary state probability distribution , @xmath37 , in terms of the laplace transform of the noise functions , @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can express @xmath37 as a sum of many terms involving @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "most of these terms will not contribute to the distribution , but we can calculate analytically the remaining ones , finding the exact expression for @xmath37 . in order to do that we need to express the laplace transforms , of the position and velocity of the bp , as functions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the following we proceed to implement the strategy just described .",
    "we start by taking the laplace transformations of eqs.([eq.01 ] ) and ( [ eq.02 ] ) ( with re@xmath40 ) : @xmath41\\ , \\tilde{v}(z)=\\tilde{\\xi}(z)+\\tilde{\\eta}(z),\\ ] ] and @xmath42    the laplace transforms for the noise correlations are given by  :    @xmath43 \\left[1-\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1-\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right]}\\right\\}+\\\\ & -&\\gamma_{2}\\,t_{2}\\,\\tau\\left\\{\\frac{3+\\tau\\left[i(q_i+q_j)+2\\epsilon\\right ] -\\tau^2(iq_i+\\epsilon)(iq_j+\\epsilon ) } { \\left[1-\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right]\\left[1+\\tau(iq_i+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1-\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right ] \\left[1+\\tau(iq_j+\\epsilon)\\right]}\\right\\}\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath44    @xmath45    it can be shown that the second member of the rhs of eq.([eq.13 ] ) does not contribute to the stationary distribution @xmath37 when @xmath46 in eq.([eq.08 ] ) .",
    "the above eqs.([eq.13 ] ) , ( [ eq.14 ] ) and ( [ eq.14b ] ) will be crucial for calculating @xmath37 via eq.([eq.08 ] ) .",
    "we observe that when @xmath47 we recover previous results  @xcite since the contribution of the slow noise disappears .",
    "furthermore , we notice that by taking the limit @xmath48 the colored noise @xmath19 becomes a white one , which is reflected in the fact that its contribution in eqs.([eq.02 ] ) and ( [ eq.11 ] ) becomes similar to the one by @xmath21 .    following a strategy similar to the used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we express the laplace transformation of position and velocity as functions of the laplace transformation of the noise functions : @xmath49,\\ ] ] @xmath50,\\ ] ] with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55    for simplicity , we assumed the initial conditions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , since for @xmath58 the terms carrying the memory of the initial conditions will decay to zero  @xcite .",
    "the denominator of @xmath59 and @xmath60 is of the third order on @xmath61 , thus , there are three distinct roots for : @xmath62 namely @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69{9\\,\\omega\\,\\theta\\,m\\tau -27\\,k \\,{m\\tau } ^{2}-2\\,{\\theta}^{3}+3\\,m\\tau\\,[3\\,(4\\,{\\omega}^ { 3}m\\tau -{\\omega}^{2}{\\theta}^{2}-18\\,\\omega\\,\\theta\\ , m\\tau \\,k+27\\,{k}^{2}{m\\tau } ^{2}+4\\,k\\,{\\theta}^{3})]^{1/2 } } .\\ ] ]    we define the quantities @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 as : @xmath76    the terms @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are important because we perform residue integrations over their poles  @xcite .",
    "it is important to compute the expressions for the leading terms in the expressions ( [ eq.23 ] ) , ( [ eq.24 ] ) and ( [ eq.25 ] ) when @xmath77 , i.e. , in the over  damped limit .",
    "since @xmath78 , in linear order on @xmath79 we have @xmath80 the function @xmath81 is already linear in @xmath79 . in the leading order in @xmath79 , we obtain : @xmath82      in appendix  [ appa ] we show the derivation for the following equation ( originally obtained in ref .",

    "the integrations paths for the variables @xmath85 can be chosen to be identical to the one shown in fig.([fig ] ) : the integrations in eq.([eq.26 ] ) will correspond to a series of residue integrations over ( only some ) of the multiple poles of its integrand .",
    "these poles correspond to the ones associated with the noise functions ( eqs.([eq.13 ] ) to ( [ eq.16 ] ) ) and the ones given by eq.([eq.17 ] ) and the function @xmath86 : @xmath87}.\\ ] ]    in special , the function @xmath86 is crucial for our computations but its role only becomes clear near the end of the calculations . as a matter of fact , the pole of i(z ) is located outside of the integration path for all @xmath85 , as in fig.([fig ] ) .",
    "the really important poles are associated with the roots of the denominators of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 above ( the z - poles ) , and the ones from the denominators of the laplace transforms for the noise variances ( the noise - poles ) , eqs.([eq.13 ] ) and ( [ eq.14 ] ) , that are locate on the inside of the path of fig.([fig ] ) . after replacing the rather complicated forms for the noise laplace",

    "the effect on @xmath86 due to the residue integration of eq.([eq.26 ] ) over its relevant poles is rather interesting .",
    "the integrations over the noise - poles for @xmath85 that are present in @xmath86 imply that the value the denominator of @xmath86 will take has a non - zero real part , even if only one of such an integration has been done . in that case , when taking the limit @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89",
    ". however , whenever an integration over any one of the @xmath85 variables at a noise - pole is done , it has the effect of reducing a sum of the form @xmath90 , @xmath91 or @xmath92 to zero in the denominator of @xmath86 .",
    "it means that the other member of the pair may be integrated around any of its poles without contributing to the denominator of @xmath86 , making that integral a possible non - zero contribution to @xmath37 , when the limit @xmath88 is taken .",
    "thus , we notice that only the residue integrations that eliminate the @xmath85 variables from the denominator of @xmath86 , two of them at a time , will reduce @xmath86 to @xmath93 only in this case , @xmath94 , the corresponding term will contribute to the stationary state distribution  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that cross terms that couple @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( @xmath97-type ) do not contribute , while other terms coupling @xmath95 and @xmath95 ( @xmath98-type ) or @xmath96 and @xmath96 ( @xmath99-type ) will give non - zero contributions . as a consequence ,",
    "the stationary probabilities for positions and velocities are independent : @xmath100 .",
    "in the following , we evaluate some typical integrals and deduce the stationary distribution .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the terms that generate the stationary state distribution @xmath37 by analyzing the distinct contributions grouped into eq.([eq.26 ] ) .",
    "so , lets start by studying a pair - integration contribution from a @xmath101correlation integral ( for a position - position correlation this is a @xmath102 $ ] pair , such as mentioned in the last section ) :    @xmath103 = \\frac{z}{z - i\\diamond}\\ , w_{\\omega},\\ ] ]    where we integrate over the contributing poles ( only ) , and @xmath104 represents the summation over the @xmath105 s and @xmath106 s that are not integrated over in the denominator of @xmath86 .",

    "it means that the information about the position distribution ( @xmath106 s ) does not get mixed up with the information about the velocity distribution ( @xmath105 s ) . in other words ,",
    "the distributions are independent ( @xmath100 ) as mentioned before .",
    "schematically , we can represent the integral in eq.([eq.26 ] ) by : @xmath124 where @xmath125 represents the noise functions laplace transforms .",
    "the number of terms above remains to be evaluated .",
    "first we notice that we can factor out the @xmath126 contributions from the @xmath127 contributions . by doing so",
    ", we only need to calculate the number of ways of integrating all @xmath102 $ ] pairs ( and similarly for the @xmath128 $ ] pairs ) .",
    "furthermore , averaging over a power @xmath129 of @xmath130 s and @xmath131 s yields a number of terms analogous to the number of ways of distributing @xmath129 balls into @xmath132 boxes that have room for two balls each .",
    "the factor above is given by : @xmath133 let s replace that into the equation for @xmath134 .",
    "the factored out contribution for the position distribution reads @xmath135",
    "@xmath136    similarly , it is straightforward to show that : @xmath137      the eqs.([eq.29 ] ) and  ( [ eq.32 ] ) combine to @xmath138    the distribution on eq.([pss ] ) is complete , normalized and exact .",
    "it represents the stationary state for extremely long times and includes more information than similar models in the massless ( over  damped ) limit . since @xmath139 , a renormalization of the mass and of",
    "the temperature will occur .",
    "recent works have suggested other mechanisms for deviations from boltzmann statistics  @xcite .",
    "a massless bp is bound to move as the instantaneous force directs it , but an inertial one can accumulate kinetic energy and its velocity deviates from the ratio between the external force and the friction coefficient , creating an opportunity for a feed - back mechanism ( incipiently present in the non - markovian colored noise @xmath19 time - scale @xmath20 ) to modify the stationary distribution away from the boltzmann equilibrium form  @xcite even at @xmath140  @xcite . taking the limit @xmath9 at @xmath140",
    "restores the boltzmann equilibrium form , despite @xmath141 , due to the crucial role of inertia in the mechanism above .",
    "the eq.([eq.28 ] ) defining the @xmath107 term , ( see appendix  [ appb ] for a complete derivation ) , gives the dependence of the stationary position distribution on all parameters of the system in its most general form .",
    "this distribution is a generalization of the expression obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and , similarly to that case , it differs from the boltzmann form due to the non - markovian character of the colored noise , but tends to it when we take @xmath142 and @xmath140 .",
    "the nontrivial forms of eqs.([eq.28 ] ) and ( [ eq.31 ] ) indicate that a renormalization of the mass ( or the rigidity @xmath143 ) takes place due to the non - markovian character of @xmath19  @xcite",
    ".    in the over damped limit , @xmath9 , the term @xmath107 simplifies considerably and reads @xmath144    the quantity @xmath145 behaves as the exact effective temperature @xmath146 for the system in the over  damped limit .",
    "we observe that both the slow and the fast noise contribute to @xmath146 .",

    "the frictional coefficient @xmath13 ( @xmath149 in their notation ) will not contribute to the equilibrium distribution since that is a function of the effective external terms only .",
