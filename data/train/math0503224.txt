    "however , these may not generate the limit ideal defining @xmath673 .",
    "so we can only infer a containment ( of schemes ) , @xmath793 .",
    "while this latter scheme is bigger than @xmath6 , it has the same support , so as sets @xmath794 .",
    "since @xmath676 is irreducible and hence equidimensional , the flat limit @xmath673 is also equidimensional , so it is supported on @xmath6 s components of top dimension , @xmath790 .",
    "( remember that we conjecture that @xmath6 has no other components , but even if it does they re not in @xmath673 . )    consequently @xmath795 for some coefficients @xmath796 , where @xmath797 is the multiplicity of @xmath51 in @xmath673 .",
    "however , we already know @xmath798 from proposition [ prop : degd1 ] and @xmath799 from corollary [ cor : totalmdeg ] , from which we see that taking @xmath800 gives a solution . to know it s the right one , it is enough to show that the polynomials @xmath801 are linearly independent over @xmath210 .",
    "let @xmath802 be a linear relation among them . by theorem [ thm : main ] , we also know @xmath803 .",
    "let @xmath296 be a link pattern . by ( * ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) , the specialization of @xmath124 at @xmath804 , @xmath805 is nonzero if and only if @xmath806 , allowing us to pick out the @xmath807 term and show @xmath808 .",
    "hence the @xmath809 are linearly independent , and the multiplicities are all @xmath791 .    the power of @xmath38 in the multiplicities on @xmath673 can be loosely blamed on the `` missing '' equations @xmath31 included in the definition of @xmath6 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath810 as schemes , which would imply our earlier conjecture that @xmath6 is equidimensional , in that @xmath673 is the flat limit of a variety and hence equidimensional .",
    "[ sec : extra ]    throughout this paper we claimed to be working with the action of an @xmath811-dimensional torus @xmath139 on the scheme @xmath6 . since the @xmath189-dimensional subtorus of @xmath139 consisting of scalar matrices acts trivially , it is really more honest to consider this an action of the @xmath4-dimensional quotient torus .",
    "the corresponding statement for the multidegrees is that while we considered our multidegrees as polynomials in @xmath812 , they can all be written as polynomials in the @xmath4 expressions @xmath813 .",
    "( of course , for the multidegrees of subschemes of @xmath156 , we have an even better statement  they are polynomials with positive coefficients in the weights @xmath814 of @xmath156 . )",
    "abstractly , we should expect that @xmath18 has an extra degree of symmetry beyond that of @xmath248 , in that @xmath1 is the multiplication on the degenerate fiber of a @xmath189-parameter family ( see section [ ssec : algdegen ] ) .",
    "it is easy to write down this bigger action : define @xmath815 if @xmath816 for each @xmath12 , then the action of @xmath817 is just conjugation by the diagonal matrix @xmath818 , followed by rescaling by @xmath432 .",
    "hence this extends the @xmath139-action .",
    "it also is easy to check that the action of the subgroup with @xmath819 preserves the product @xmath1 on @xmath14 .",
    "first , @xmath820 e^{hm } ) \\\\ & = & \\left ( \\prod_{i : { \\circlearrowleft ( { h\\leq i < m } ) } } \\omega_i\\right )   \\delta_{jk } [ { \\circlearrowleft ( { h\\leq j\\leq m})}]e^{hm}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now notice that @xmath821 implies that @xmath822 which is what we need to establish @xmath823 when both sides are nonzero .",
    "since this action with @xmath819 preserves @xmath1 , it preserves the scheme @xmath6 , and @xmath432 is just acting by rescaling @xmath6 .    call this bigger torus @xmath824 , and use @xmath825 for the obvious basis of its weight lattice .",
    "then we get the following equation on the @xmath824 and @xmath139multidegrees of an affine scheme @xmath826 : @xmath827 where each @xmath828 has been specialized to @xmath829 .",
