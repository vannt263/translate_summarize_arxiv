    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off protons has provided decisive information on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton .",
    "inclusive measurements of the cross section for the reaction @xmath2 as a function of the virtuality of the exchanged boson ( @xmath3 ) and of the bjorken scaling variable ( @xmath1 ) have been used to determine the proton structure function @xmath4 .",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) approximation has been widely used to extract the proton pdfs from such measurements and to test the validity of pqcd . in the standard approach ( dglap  @xcite ) , the evolution equations sum up all leading double logarithms in @xmath5 along with single logarithms in @xmath6 and are expected to be valid for @xmath1 not too small . at low @xmath1 , a better approximation is expected to be provided by the bfkl formalism  @xcite in which the evolution equations sum up all leading double logarithms along with single logarithms in @xmath7 .",
    "the dglap evolution equations have been tested extensively at hera and were found to describe , in general , the data . in particular , the striking rise of the measured @xmath4 at hera with decreasing @xmath1",
    "can be accomodated in the dglap approach .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusive character of @xmath4 may obscure the underlying dynamics at low @xmath1 , and more exclusive final states like forward   axis pointing in the proton beam direction , referred to as the `` forward direction '' .",
    "] jets  @xcite need to be studied .",
    "bfkl evolution predicts a larger fraction of small-@xmath1 events containing high-@xmath8 forward jets than predicted by dglap  @xcite .",
    "parton dynamics at low @xmath1 is particularly relevant for the lhc given that most of the interesting hard processes involve partons with low fractional momenta .",
    "forward jet production in neutral current ( nc ) dis has been studied extensively at hera . as an example ,",
    "measurements of forward jet production with @xmath9  gev , polar angle @xmath10 between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the proton - beam energy , in the kinematic region defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17  gev@xmath18 are shown in figure  [ figura1]a and exhibit a strong rise towards low @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "perturbative qcd apparently does not account for such a rise : the leading - order ( lo ) qcd calculation does not predict any rise while the one predicted by nlo  @xcite is still much too low ( see figure  [ figura1]a ) . some of the feynman diagrams that are accounted for in the lo ( @xmath19 ) and nlo ( @xmath20 ) calculations are shown in figure  [ figura1]b .",
    "the former has no additional gluon radiation and helps to understand why in the lo calculation there is hardly any phase space left for forward jet production .",
    "in contrast , the nlo calculation accounts for the radiation of one additional gluon . this explains why there is such a huge increase from lo to nlo : due to the opening of a new channel , namely gluon - exchange in the @xmath21 channel .",
    "however , that means that the nlo calculation is effectively a `` lo '' calculation , since no corrections are included .",
    "the nlo calculation should thus have large theoretical uncertainties from higher orders .",
    "a variation of the renormalisation scale around @xmath22 do not give rise to such large theoretical uncertainties ( see figure  [ figura1]a ) .",
    "however , if @xmath3 is instead chosen as the renormalisation scale , the resulting theoretical uncertainties are large , as pointed out in  @xcite and shown in figure  [ figura1]c : measurements of forward jet production  @xcite with @xmath23  gev , pseudorapidity in the range @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the kinematic region given by @xmath27 and @xmath28  gev@xmath18 are compared to nlo qcd calculations  @xcite with @xmath29 .",
    "large theoretical uncertainties which arise from higher orders in the pqcd calculations prevent a firm conclusion .",
    "further progress can be made by making measurements for which genuine nlo calculations are available , i.e. one gluon radiation at lo and two additional radiated gluons at nlo .",
    "that is the case for three - jet production , which was already studied in  @xcite and has been investigated more thoroughly in  @xcite .",
    "the latter is discussed next .",
    "( 10.0,8.0 ) ( -5.0,0.0 ) ( 2.0,2.0 ) ( 7.1,-0.3 ) ( -1.1,-0.3)(a ) ( 4.1,-0.3)(b ) ( 10.1,-0.3)(c ) ( 2.3,1.3)lo @xmath19 ( 5.0,1.3)nlo @xmath30",
    "some of the feynman diagrams accounted for in the pqcd calculations for three - jet production in nc dis are shown in figure  [ figura2]a .",
    "a measurement of the differential cross section @xmath31 as a function of @xmath1 for three - jet production  @xcite is presented in figure  [ figura2]b .",
    "the jets are reconstructed in the @xmath32 frame and are required to fulfill the following conditions : the transverse momentum of each jet @xmath33  gev , the sum of the highest and next - to - highest @xmath34 jets above 9  gev , the jet pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame to lie between -1 and 2.5 and at least one of the jets in the central region ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the kinematic region is defined by @xmath36 , @xmath37  gev@xmath18 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the inelasticity variable .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations are compared to the data in figure  [ figura2]b : the lo ( @xmath20 ) calculation still falls short of the data , but the nlo ( @xmath40 ) calculation  @xcite improves dramatically the description of the data at low @xmath1 .      the inclusion of the @xmath40 qcd corrections does not only improve the description of the measured rate but also that of the topology of the events .",
    "measurements have been made of the distributions in the variables used to describe the topology of three - jet events in the three - jet centre - of - mass frame : the scaled energy of the jets @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ) and the two angles @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see figure  [ figura2]c ) .",
    "the measurements are shown in figure  [ figura3 ] and compared to nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additional gluon radiation provides an improved description of the data , for example , in the @xmath47 distribution : the nlo follows the data and exhibits peaks at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , whereas the lo calculation flattens out at @xmath48 .",
    "further investigations of low-@xmath1 parton dynamics have been made by studying transverse - energy and angular correlations in dijet and trijet production in nc dis  @xcite .",
    "jets are reconstructed in the hadronic centre - of - mass ( hcm ) frame and required to fulfill the following conditions : @xmath50  gev , @xmath51  gev and @xmath52 .",
    "the kinematic region is given by @xmath36 , @xmath53  gev@xmath18 and @xmath54 .",
    "one of the most interesting angular correlations is provided by the variable @xmath55 , which is defined as the azimuthal separation of the two jets with largest @xmath56 . for dijet events , @xmath19 kinematics constrain @xmath55 to @xmath57 and @xmath30 calculations provide the lo contribution ; @xmath41 calculations give the nlo correction .",
    "measurements of the doubly differential cross section @xmath58 for dijet production in different regions of @xmath1 are presented in figure  [ figura4 ] .",
    "the @xmath30 predictions increasingly deviate from the data as @xmath1 decreases , whereas @xmath41 calculations  @xcite provide a good description of the data even at low @xmath1 .    in summary ,",
    "parton dynamics at low @xmath1 is vigorously pursued at hera .",
    "precise measurements of multijet production in nc dis have been made down to @xmath59 in terms of jet rates , topologies and correlations .",
    "comparison of perturbative qcd calculations with these measurements demonstrate the big impact of initial - state gluon radiation .",
    "perturbative qcd at @xmath40 reproduces succesfully the measurements .",
    "however , the theoretical uncertainties are still significant and the precision of the data demands next - to - next - to - leading - order corrections to be included .",
