    "in this paper we consider the following two problems :    1 .   given a cut - and - project setup corresponding to an @xmath0 action on @xmath1 , construct a ( non - trivial ) infinite collection of @xmath2-dimensional windows which each give rise to a cut - and - project set that is bounded distance from a lattice .",
    "2 .   given a minimal rotation of @xmath3 , explicitly construct a ( non - trivial ) infinite collection of regions in @xmath4 , for which the differences between the time and space averages of the system over each of the regions achieve the minimum possible asymptotic bound .",
    "as we will see in what follows , problems ( i ) and ( ii ) are closely related .",
    "a region which satisfies the condition in problem ( ii ) is called a _ bounded remainder set _ ( brs ) for the corresponding rotation .",
    "for @xmath5 the problem is satisfactorily dealt with by works of hecke @xcite , ostrowski @xcite , and kesten @xcite ( and also related results of oren @xcite ) , which together show that for an irrational rotation of @xmath6 by @xmath7 , the necessary and sufficient condition for an interval @xmath8 to be a brs is that @xmath9 this translates easily into a solution of problem ( i ) for the special case when @xmath10 .",
    "the first author has recently explored and improved upon this connection in @xcite , using detailed arguments involving the theory of continued fractions .",
    "several papers @xcite have investigated problem ( ii ) when @xmath11 . of particular note are the works of szsz @xcite , who demonstrated a construction of parallelogram brs s when @xmath12 , and liardet ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) , who used a dynamical cocycles argument to extend szsz s result to arbitrary @xmath11 .",
    "our goal in this paper is to provide a new constructive solution of both problems above , which works for all choices of dimensions and parameters involved . with respect to problem ( ii ) ,",
    "the collection of brs s which we construct is different than the collection which can be constructed using liardet s above mentioned result .",
    "our proofs rely on a beautiful result of rauzy @xcite , which provides a sufficient condition for a set in the @xmath13-torus to be a brs .    to understand the connection between the above problems , first note that taking @xmath14 in problem ( i ) essentially gives a reformulation of problem ( ii ) ( i.e. with @xmath15 )",
    ". therefore solutions to problem ( i ) when @xmath14 immediately give solutions to problem ( ii ) , for the corresponding toral rotations .",
    "it will become clear in the course of our proofs that this implication also goes the other way , so that solving problem ( ii ) gives solutions to problem ( i ) . in brief , by using a brs associated to just one direction in our @xmath16-dimensional physical space , we obtain enough structure to ensure that we can move the entire cut and project set to a lattice , moving each point by at most a bounded amount .",
    "to state our results more precisely , we first make some definitions .",
    "let @xmath17 be a @xmath16-dimensional subspace of @xmath1 , and let @xmath18 be the canonical projection .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 is the image under @xmath20 of a bounded subset of a @xmath2-dimensional plane in @xmath1 which is everywhere transverse to @xmath17 ( @xmath21 is what we will call a _ section _ or a _ window _ ) , and for each @xmath22 define @xmath23 by @xmath24 we refer to @xmath25 as the _ cut - and - project set _ associated to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in much of what follows we will assume that @xmath17 is a _ totally irrational _",
    "subspace of @xmath1 ( equivalently , that @xmath28 is dense in @xmath29 ) . to see that this incurs no loss of generality , notice that every subspace of @xmath1 has a dense orbit in some ` sub - torus ' of @xmath29 , so by re - parameterizing when necessary our problems can always be brought into such a situation .",
    "generically , a cut - and - project set as above is an aperiodic separated net ( i.e. delone set ) in @xmath17 .",
    "several authors @xcite have recently addressed the question of determining how far away such sets can be from lattices in @xmath17 .",
    "one way of measuring this is to say that two sets in @xmath1 are _ bounded distance _ ( bd ) to one another if there is a bijection between them which moves each point by at most some fixed constant amount .",
    "this agrees exactly with the definition in other papers of _ bounded displacement equivalence_. it was proved in @xcite that for any @xmath30 for almost every @xmath16-dimensional subspace @xmath17 of @xmath1 ( in the sense of the natural measure on the grassmannian manifold ) , and for every section @xmath21 which is a @xmath2-dimensional aligned box ( a box with all sides parallel to coordinate planes in @xmath1 ) , the set @xmath31 is bd to a lattice in @xmath17 . on the other hand it was also shown in the same paper that for almost every section @xmath21 which is a parallelotope ( or ball , ellipsoid , or suitably nice shape ) , there is a residual set of subspaces @xmath17 for which the corresponding sets @xmath31 are not bd to any lattice .",
    "this shows that the problem of determining which cut - and - project sets are bd to a lattice is not trivial .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the above mentioned results all rely on the diophantine approximation properties of the subspace @xmath17 . for subspaces",
    "@xmath17 which are extremely well approximable by rational subspaces , the above results give no information about cut - and - project sets coming from @xmath17",
    ". with this as a backdrop , we present our first result .",
    "[ thm.main ] for any @xmath32 and @xmath17 as above , there is an infinite collection of @xmath2-dimensional sections with the property that , for any section @xmath21 from the collection , and for any @xmath33 the set @xmath25 is bd to a lattice .    in our proof of this theorem",
    "we will construct an infinite family of sections ( which necessarily depends on @xmath17 ) which satisfy the conclusion .",
    "our aim is in fact to prove that these sections are examples of bounded remainder sets , of which theorem [ thm.main ] is a corollary .",
    "there is a related construction , due to duneau and oguey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , which can be used to give an alternative proof of this theorem , however it does not illustrate the connection to the bounded remainder set problem .",
    "let us now formally define bounded remainder sets . for a lebesgue measure preserving transformation @xmath34 , we will say that a measurable set @xmath35 is a _ bounded remainder set _ for @xmath36 if @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the indicator function of @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes its measure .",
    "we are interested primarily in the case when @xmath36 is a rotation , given by @xmath41 for some @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we may refer to a brs for @xmath36 as a brs for @xmath7 , or simply a brs , if the context is clear .",
    "as in our discussion above , there is little loss of generality in assuming that @xmath7 is a totally irrational rotation ( i.e. that @xmath43 is dense in @xmath4 ) .",
    "to fit the definition of bounded remainder sets into a larger framework , we digress for a moment .",
    "it is important in many contexts to quantify how evenly distributed a sequence of numbers is , modulo @xmath44 .",
    "one way of doing this is to define , for @xmath45 , the _ discrepancy _ @xmath46 of a sequence @xmath47 by @xmath48 where the supremum is taken over all sets in some suitable family @xmath49 of subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "it is common to take @xmath49 to be the collection of all aligned boxes , which then leads to many important applications , for example the koksma - hlawka inequality in numerical integration ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.14 ) . for aligned boxes ( and some other classes of special shapes )",
    "a useful estimate for @xmath46 can be obtained by using the erds - turn - koksma inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.21 ) . bounding",
    "the discrepancy in this way involves estimating certain exponential sums . for the case when @xmath50 these sums grow large when @xmath7 is well approximable by rational numbers , which is a limitation in many problems .",
    "unfortunately the discrepancy estimates which are obtained in this way are not far from the truth .",
    "results of van aardenne - ehrenfest @xcite , and later of roth @xcite and w.  m.  schmidt @xcite imply that , for any sequence , the discrepancy can never remain bounded as @xmath51 .",
    "this highlights the special place in this theory occupied by bounded remainder sets .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned work , bounded remainder sets have been studied by a number of authors .",
    "w. m. schmidt @xcite showed that , for any sequence @xmath52 , there are at most a countably infinite number of possible volumes @xmath40 for measurable sets @xmath35 satisfying @xmath53 for the special case when @xmath54 , for some @xmath55 and totally irrational @xmath56 liardet @xcite proved that the only examples of aligned boxes @xmath39 which are brs s are the trivial ones which are derived from the @xmath5 problem . in other words , they consist only of products of intervals of the form @xmath57 for which there exists an @xmath58 such that @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .",
    "these examples constitute what we refer to as the ` trivial ' solutions to problems ( i ) and ( ii ) above .",
    "non - trivial examples of brs s for @xmath12 were given in @xcite , and for @xmath62 in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more discussion of what is known ) . as indicated above , combining szsz and liaret s results ( @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4 ) ) , one can obtain a nice algorithm for constructing examples of parallelotope brs s in any dimension .    in this paper",
    "we are going to provide a simple construction , using a sufficient condition due to rauzy @xcite , which produces infinitely many examples of brs s , for any @xmath13 and for any irrational rotation of @xmath4 .",
    "the brs s which we construct in this way are what we will call _ special regions _ , and they are obtained by projections to the torus of parallelotopes coming from a lattice in @xmath63 defined by the rotation .    [ thm.mainbrs ] for any totally irrational rotation @xmath7 of @xmath4 , every special region for @xmath7 is a brs .    for comparison with szsz and liardet s brs s , we note that the parallelotopes obtained from liardet s algorithm always have a face parallel to one of the coordinate hyperplanes in @xmath64 . our special regions , on the other hand ,",
    "typically do not have this property .",
    "it would be nice to understand the exact intersection of the two collections of regions constructed by our different algorithms , but this seems to be a technically difficult problem .",
    "we will define special regions in section [ sec.descrspecreg ] , and show using rauzy s criteria that they are brs s .",
    "then we will explain a method for explicitly constructing an infinite collection of special regions , for any irrational rotation . in section [ sec.specregtospecsec ]",
    "we will conclude by completing the proof of theorem [ thm.main ] .",

    "we would also like to mention that michael kelly and lorenzo sadun have informed us that they have obtained results similar to our theorem [ thm.main ] , which should be forthcoming .",
    "finally , we would like to thank the referee for his or her suggestions , which helped us to make several significant improvements in the paper .",

    "let @xmath67 , and define @xmath68 to be the lattice in @xmath63 generated by @xmath69 together with the first @xmath13 standard basis vectors , @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath68 consists precisely of all vectors of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    ", we define @xmath74 to be the projection map from @xmath63 to the @xmath75-plane in @xmath76 , and for simplicity of notation we set @xmath77 and identify @xmath64 with @xmath78 . finally , for any linearly independent vectors @xmath79 in @xmath76 , we denote by @xmath80 the parallelotope which the vectors generate , in the linear subspace they span .",
    "we assume that the boundary of the parallelotope is chosen so that @xmath81 is a fundamental domain for the lattice generated by @xmath79 , in the subspace which they span .",

    "[ cond.up ] for any subset @xmath87 we have that @xmath88",
    "we will explain how to construct such regions at the end of this section .",
    "first we focus on the proof of theorem [ thm.mainbrs ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath36 is a totally irrational rotation as above and that @xmath35 is any set .",
    "let @xmath89 be the map induced by @xmath36 on @xmath39 ( i.e. the first return map to @xmath39 ) .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath39 to be a brs for @xmath36 , it is sufficient that there exists a lattice @xmath90 and a point @xmath91 , such that    1 .",

    "suppose that @xmath39 satisfies conditions ( s1)-(s4 ) , define @xmath97 to be the lattice in @xmath64 generated by @xmath98 , and let @xmath99 .",
    "it is obvious from the definitions that condition ( r1 ) is satisfied . in order to check ( r2 )",
    "we begin with some observations .",
    "first notice that the ( forward and backward ) orbit of @xmath100 under @xmath101 is encoded in the points of @xmath68 which lie in the cylinder @xmath102 .",
    "the last coordinate of each such point encodes its return time , with respect to @xmath36 . in other words , @xmath103 next , denote by @xmath104 the hyperplane in @xmath63 spanned by @xmath105 , and for each @xmath106 define @xmath107 it follows from ( s3 ) that the lattice @xmath68 can be written as the disjoint union @xmath108 for each @xmath109 , the set @xmath110 is a fundamental domain for @xmath111 .",
    "therefore each set @xmath112 contains exactly one point .",
    "[ fig.windmills ]     as it moves up through the hyperplanes @xmath113 .",

    "to finish the proof simply observe that , for any @xmath124 we can find a sequence @xmath125 such that @xmath126 from this it follows that @xmath127 .",
    "now we explain a method for constructing infinitely many special regions .",
    "denote the positive cone generated by a collection of points @xmath128 by @xmath129 suppose that @xmath42 is totally irrational , and without loss of generality suppose that @xmath7 is chosen so that it lies in the cube @xmath130 .",

    "the region @xmath135 is all of @xmath4 , and it is clearly a special region satisfying ( s1)-(s4 ) above .",
    "now consider what happens when we replace one of the vectors @xmath136 , for some @xmath137 , with the vector @xmath138 .",
    "the new collection of vectors will still be a fundamental domain for @xmath68 , and we claim that @xmath139 to verify this , note that by ( s2 ) we can write @xmath140 with @xmath141 for each @xmath142 .",

    ", we can construct as many new examples of non - trivial special regions as we wish .    for comparison ,",
    "the reader may wish to note that , in the case @xmath5 the procedure we have described here is exactly analogous to the simple continued fraction algorithm .",
    "as in the introduction , by re - parameterizing in a sub - torus if necessary , we may assume throughout this section that @xmath17 is a totally irrational @xmath16-dimensional subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "we parameterize @xmath17 by choosing real numbers @xmath151 , for @xmath152 and @xmath153 , such that @xmath154 let @xmath155 and set @xmath156 .",
    "since @xmath17 is a totally irrational subspace of @xmath1 , it follows that @xmath7 is totally irrational in @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath39 be any special region for the irrational rotation of @xmath64 by @xmath7 , and let @xmath21 be the canonical embedding of @xmath39 into the subspace generated by @xmath157 in @xmath1 .",

    "we wish to show that , for any special section @xmath21 , and for any @xmath22 , the set @xmath25 is bd to a lattice .",
    "an equivalent problem is to show that , for any set @xmath21 which is a translate of a special section by an element of the subspace generated by @xmath157 , the set @xmath158 is bd to a lattice .",
    "therefore suppose that @xmath21 is a section of the latter form .    using the notation described above ,",

    "there is a linear map from @xmath31 to the set @xmath162 defined by @xmath163 therefore it is sufficient for us to show that @xmath164 is bd to a lattice .",
    "we remark that this part of the argument necessarily introduces an additional rescaling constant , which depends only on @xmath17 , in the final bd map for @xmath31 itself .",
    "by theorem [ thm.mainbrs ] , there exists a constant @xmath172 , which only depends on @xmath39 , such that for any @xmath173 and for any @xmath174 @xmath175 it is easy to see from the definition of a brs ( e.g. see the comment at the end of the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.6 ) ) that this inequality also holds for all @xmath176 , and this proves that the map defined above is a bd map from @xmath164 to a lattice .",
