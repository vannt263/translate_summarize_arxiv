    "one of the most important ingredients in the search for `` signals '' of new phenomena in high energy particle physics experiments is a precise knowledge of the expectations from standard physics ; the `` background '' .",
    "usually this involves perturbative calculations of differential cross sections within the standard model .",
    "many such radiative corrections have been carried out and require the evaluation of one - loop integrals which arise directly from a feynman diagrammatic approach .",
    "often these integrals need to be performed in an arbitrary dimension in order to isolate any infrared and ultraviolet divergences that may be present @xcite .",
    "the basic one - loop tensor integral in @xmath3 dimensions for @xmath0 external particles scattering with outgoing momenta @xmath4 , @xmath0 internal propagators with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 loop momenta in the numerator can be written , @xmath7   = \\int \\frac{d^{d}\\ell}{i\\pi^{d/2 } } \\frac{\\ell^{\\mu_1}\\ldots\\ell^{\\mu_m } } { ( \\ell^2-m_1 ^ 2 ) ( ( \\ell+q_1)^2-m_2 ^ 2 ) \\cdots ( ( \\ell+q_{n-1})^2-m_n^2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and , @xmath9 the scalar integral is denoted @xmath10 $ ] . in the standard approach to such integrals @xcite one utilises the fact that the tensor structure must be carried by the external momenta or the metric tensor @xmath11 . for example , the simplest non - trivial tensor integral in @xmath3 dimensions has a single loop momentum @xmath12 .",

    "the formfactors are then obtained by algebraically solving the system of @xmath1 equations .",
    "this introduces the @xmath21 gram determinant , @xmath22 ( where @xmath20 and @xmath23 run over the @xmath1 independent momenta ) , into the denominator .",
    "each formfactor is a sum over the scalar integrals present in the problem multiplied by a kinematic coefficient that may be singular at the boundary of phase space where the gram determinant vanishes .",

    "since , in many cases , the formfactors @xmath14 are actually finite in this limit , there are large cancellations and there may be problems of numerical stability .",
    "the basic approach has been modified in a variety of ways , including the introduction of a system of @xmath1 reciprocal vectors @xmath27 ( and the associated second rank tensor @xmath28 playing the role of @xmath11 ) to carry the tensor structure @xcite where , @xmath29 so that , @xmath30 this simplifies the identification of the formfactor coefficients , but does not eliminate the gram determinants .",
    "in fact , in both approaches , the number of gram determinants generated is equal to the number of loop momenta in the numerator of the original integral .",
    "a different approach has been suggested by davydychev @xcite , who has identified the formfactors directly as loop integrals in differing numbers of dimensions and with the loop propagator factors raised to different powers .",
    "tarasov @xcite has obtained recursion relations for one - loop integrals of this type , so that a complete reduction is possible . however , in relating the formfactor loop integrals to ordinary scalar loop integrals in 4 ( or close to 4 ) dimensions , the gram determinant once again appears in the denominator as in equation  ( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "finally , bern , kosower and dixon have used the feynman parameter space formulation for loop integrals to derive explicit results for the scalar integrals including the scalar pentagon @xcite .",
    "the formfactors of the momentum space decomposition are directly related to feynman parameter integrals with one or more feynman parameters in the numerator .",
    "one can see this by introducing the auxiliary momentum @xmath31 , @xmath32 so that after integrating out the loop momentum , the tensor integral for a single loop momentum in the numerator can be expressed in terms of the external momenta @xmath33 , @xmath13   \\to \\i^d_n[\\p^{\\mu } ] \\equiv - \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1 } \\i^d_n[x_{i+1}]q_i^\\mu.\\ ] ] here , @xmath34 $ ] represents the scalar integral with a single factor of @xmath35 in the numerator . by comparing with equation  ( [ eq : formfactor ] ) ,",
    "we see that , @xmath36.\\ ] ] differentiating with respect to the external kinematic variables , yields relations between integrals with polynomials of feynman parameters in the numerator and the usual scalar integrals .",
    "once again , the gram determinant appears in the denominator , and the final result for the formfactor @xmath14 combines @xmath0-point integrals with the pinched @xmath1-point integrals as in equation  ( [ eq : toy ] ) .",
    "the presence of the gram determinant is , in some ways , no great surprise . in the limit @xmath37",
    ", the @xmath1 momenta no longer span an @xmath1-dimensional space , the @xmath1 equations of the passarino - veltman approach are no longer independent and the decomposition is invalid .",
    "stuart @xcite has made modifications to the basic approach to account for this , the main observation being that for @xmath38 , the scalar @xmath0-point integral can be written as a sum of scalar @xmath1-point integrals . as a consequence ,",
    "there are large cancellations between scalar integrals with differing numbers of external legs in the kinematic limit of vanishing gram determinants . for loop corrections to processes such as quarkonium decay , where the two heavy quarks are considered to travel collinearly and share the quarkonium momentum",
    ", one can eliminate the gram determinant singularities completely using the method of stuart @xcite .",
    "however , for more general scattering processes where the collinear limit may be approached , but is not exact , the numerical problems as @xmath37 remain . in this paper",
    ", we wish to address the problem by combining the scalar integrals into functions that are well behaved in the @xmath37 limit @xcite , so that the formfactors are given by , @xmath39 + \\sum_{m=1}^n \\beta^\\prime_m",
    "\\i_{n-1}^{d,(m)}[1]\\right ) + { \\rm finite},\\ ] ] where `` finite '' represents terms that are manifestly well behaved as @xmath37 , and the grouping @xmath40 vanishes with @xmath41 . such groupings",
    "combine a variety of dilogarithms , logarithms and constants together in a non - trivial way .",
    "in fact , for higher rank tensor integrals , with higher powers of gram determinants in the denominator , it becomes even more desirable to organise the scalar integrals in this way .",
    "it is possible to construct these well behaved groupings by brute force , making a taylor expansion of the scalar integrals in the appropriate limit .",
    "however , as we will show , they systematically and naturally arise by considering the scalar integral in @xmath42 or higher dimensions dimensions . ] and/or by differentiating the scalar integrals with respect to the external kinematic variables .",
    "our approach is therefore to re - express the formfactor coefficients in terms of functions that are finite as @xmath37 , explicitly cancelling off factors of the determinant where possible .",
    "the one - loop matrix elements for physical processes will then depend on these finite combinations , which can themselves be expanded as a taylor series to obtain the required numerical precision .",
    "an additional improvement is that the physical size of the resulting expression is significantly reduced because the scalar integrals have been combined to form new , more natural functions .",
    "of course , one loop amplitudes may also contain spurious singularities other than those directly arising from gram determinants .",
    "such singularities may occur as one or more of the external legs becomes lightlike or as two external momenta become collinear .",
    "our approach has the advantage of avoiding such ` fake ' singularities .",
    "since the new finite functions are obtained by differentiating the scalar integrals , they can not contain additional kinematic singularities beyond those already present in the scalar integral .",
    "this helps to ensure that only genuine poles - those allowed at tree level - are explicitly present in the one - loop matrix elements . once again",
    ", this helps to reduce the size of the expressions for the amplitudes .    in this paper , we address how such finite functions might be generated for arbitrary processes .",
    "we will closely follow the notation and approach of bern , kosower and dixon to derive relationships between integrals with polynomials of feynman parameters in the numerators as well as between integrals with fewer parameters but in higher dimensions .",
    "the basic definitions and notations are introduced in section  2 and the recursive relations for integrals with up to four feynman parameters in the numerator are presented along with the dimension shifting relation of @xcite .",
    "these expressions are valid for arbitrary internal and external masses and for general kinematics .",
    "however , making sense of these relations with respect to the singular limit depends on the actual integral itself ; i.e. on @xmath0 and the specific values of the kinematic variables .",
    "the remainder of our paper describes a series of explicit realisations of the three , four and five point integrals relevant for the one - loop corrections for the decay of a virtual gauge boson into four massless partons @xcite . in section  3",
    ", we consider tensor three point integrals for all internal masses equal to zero , but for general external kinematics .",
    "section  4 describes tensor box integrals with one and two external massive legs while the tensor pentagon integral is explicitly worked through in section  5 .",
    "our main results are summarised in section  6 , while some explicit results for three and four point tensor integrals are collected in the appendices .",

    "it is possible to generate all integrals with feynman parameters in the numerator .",
    "the second step of bern , kosower and dixon s work @xcite is to relate the @xmath0-point integral with one feynman parameter in the numerator to a collection of scalar @xmath0 and @xmath1-point integrals , @xmath56 = \\frac{1}{2n_n } \\sum_{m=1}^n \\left (   \\frac{\\ghat_i\\ghat_m}{\\gnhat } - \\eta_{im } \\right )   \\ihat_{n-1}^{d\\,(m)}[1 ] + \\frac{\\ghat_i}{\\gnhat}\\ihat_n^d[1 ] , \\label{eq : inxibdk}\\ ] ] where coincides with @xmath57 of @xcite .",

    "the summation over @xmath6 represents all possible pinchings of the @xmath0-point graph to form @xmath1-point integrals .",
    "as expected , we immediately see the appearance of the gram determinants in the denominator .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : deriv ] ) and ( [ eq : inxibdk ] ) are equivalent and since , with a few notable exceptions , the scalar integrals have a taylor expansion around @xmath60 , the act of differentiation will not usually introduce a singular behaviour .",
