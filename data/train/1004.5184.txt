    "symmetries impose powerful constraints in physics , leading wick _ et al . _ to suggest that the associated conserved quantities lead to additional restrictions on quantum theory , the so - called superselection rules ( ssrs )  @xcite .",
    "they conjectured that superselection prevents the existence of coherent superpositions of charge , for example .",
    "however , aharonov and susskind  @xcite showed that the ability to observe superpositions depends on having a shared reference frame relative to which the system can be prepared and measured .",
    "more generally , elements of quantum theory require reformulation in the presence of ssrs . quantum entanglement and various forms of non - locality",
    "are particular examples of phenomena that are affected by the presence of ssrs , and a vast body of literature already exists on these topics  @xcite-@xcite .    here , we focus on bell inequality violation in the presence of ssrs .",
    "we concentrate on the bi - partite case where _ both _ the entangled principal system and any ancilla / reference frame are subject to particle - number superselection . in particular , we examine the role of the measurement apparatus or reference frame used by the two observers ( our prototypical alice and bob ) .",
    "we find that reference frames prepared using only local operations which satisfy ssrs and classical communication ( ssr - locc ) _ can not _ reveal the non - locality of an entangled system .",
    "however , jointly prepared but separable reference frames can be used to violate a bell inequality with an entangled principal system . by imposing separability of the reference frame",
    ", we deduce that violation is due to the measured entangled state ; the reference allows the observers to carry out measurements that lead to a violation of the bell inequality . in such cases , the reference is said to activate bell violation .",
    "previous work has explored the issue of bell inequality violation in the presence of ssrs , given suitable reference frames  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in contrast to some previous works , here the reference frame is both explicitly separable and compliant with the ssrs .",
    "we show in general that all references prepared jointly , and only such references , can activate bell violation .",
    "we find minimal reference frames and relate the degree of bell violation to the ` non - locality ' in the reference as measured by superselection - induced variance  @xcite .",
    "this holds in particular for measurements of single particle states and is a clear proof that such states can exhibit non - locality @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we also discuss related single - photon experiments  @xcite and conclude that there is still the need for new experiments .",
    "we begin with the description of a bell experiment in the presence of particle - number superselection .",
    "consider the situation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bell ] .",
    "a source distributes to alice and bob an entangled pure state of @xmath0-particles , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability that alice finds she has @xmath3 particles . under particle - number superselection ,",
    "all states and measurements commute with the particle - number operator @xmath4 .",
    "ordinarily , all alice and bob can do is simply count the number of particles each receives . in order to do more than this",
    ", they share in advance a joint reference frame in the state @xmath5 , assumed to be separable and also obeying particle - number superselection .",
    "therefore , before state ( [ principal ] ) is distributed to alice and bob they share no entanglement . by making joint ssr respecting measurements on each of their respective halves of the entangled system and reference frame ( @xmath6 for alice , @xmath7 for bob ) , they hope to be able to demonstrate a bell inequality violation .    .",
    "the experiment begins with an emission of a principal system in a state @xmath8 . according to the ssr",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath8 are incoherent mixtures of states with well - defined total number of particles .",
    "alice ( on the left ) has now access to subsystems @xmath9 and @xmath10 and similarly bob ( on the right ) has access to @xmath11 and @xmath12 . both local subsystems are next measured by superselection - constrained observables , described by projections onto states with well - defined total number of particles in the subsystems . in a given experimental run , one of many observables is measured at each site , the choice of which is depicted by a tuneable knob ( arrow ) on the measuring device . finally , one of many measurement results is obtained as depicted by a number on the yellow screen ( e.g. @xmath13 for alice , @xmath14 for bob ) . in short , for this scenario a violation of a bell inequality can be observed if and only if the reference state @xmath5 is prepared jointly , and that the more particles in the reference state the larger the violation . ]",
    "we first show that reference frames prepared using only local operations satisfying ssrs and classical communication ( ssr - locc ) can not activate violation of any bell inequality .",
    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "all such reference states commute with _ local _ particle - number operators and therefore are of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) counts particles in the reference frame of alice ( bob ) .",
    "these states contain only classical correlations between fixed local number of particles as measured by quantum discord and similar quantities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "consider for the moment that the reference frame is in the pure state @xmath18 .",
    "we can express the initial joint state of the system and reference frame as @xmath19 grouping subsystems accessible to alice and bob , respectively .",
    "note that every term of this superposition contains a different number of local particles , i.e. @xmath20 for alice and @xmath21 for bob . as local ssr observant measurements project onto states with a well - defined number of local particles , only one term in the superposition can contribute to the probability of a corresponding result .",
    "this , however , is exactly the same as making the measurements on a state in a mixture of @xmath22 with probability @xmath2 , and this separable state clearly admits a local hidden variable model . if one replaces @xmath2 in this model with @xmath23 all measurement results obtained with a general mixed reference state ( [ ssr - locc - ref ] )",
    "are reproduced .",
    "therefore , no bell inequality can be violated .",
    "we now show that all reference frames which can not be prepared via ssr - locc are useful for bell violation .",
    "we begin with the characterization of such references .",
    "we can express all reference states in the general form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability of @xmath26 particles in the reference frame and @xmath27 is any state with a fixed total number of particles @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath5 is an arbitrary mixture of pure states of the form @xmath28 . since we assume that @xmath5 can not be prepared via ssr - locc , it necessarily contains off - diagonal elements in the particle number basis .",
    "all such states have a non - vanishing expectation of @xmath29 , \\label{coherence}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 for some @xmath32 . to see this , note that @xmath33 is proportional to the average value of the sum @xmath34 over the pure states @xmath35 in the decomposition of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 vanishes if the sums vanish for all the pure states . for states",
    "@xmath35 that have coherences in the particle number basis , this only occurs if the signs of the products @xmath36 alternate for some values of @xmath37 leading to cancellation in the sum .",
    "in such a case however , we can always choose a larger @xmath38 to skip the terms which lead to the cancellation .",
    "thus , a state @xmath5 can be prepared via ssr - locc if and only if @xmath39 for all values of @xmath32 .",
    "as we now show , all reference states with non - vanishing coherence parameter @xmath33 enable observers to choose measurements that lead to a violation of the clauser  horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "consider an entangled principal system in the state @xmath40 we show in appendix a that there always exist dichotomic local measurements compatible with the ssr whose outcomes on the joint state of the principal system and reference frame are correlated as @xmath41 where the angle @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) parameterizes the @xmath16th ( @xmath17th ) setting of alice ( bob ) .",
    "we insert this expression into the chsh parameter @xmath44 and find values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 for which @xmath45 is higher than the local realism bound @xmath46 .",
    "namely , we choose @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and parameterize the settings of bob by a single angle @xmath49 , leading to @xmath50 to find its maximum , note that @xmath45 has a form of a scalar product between the vector @xmath51 and an arbitrary normalized vector @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , there always exists an angle @xmath53 such that @xmath54 is parallel to @xmath55 and the maximum of the scalar product is given by the length of @xmath55 : @xmath56 to summarize , all reference frames that can not be prepared via ssr - locc have a non - vanishing coherence parameter @xmath33 and consequently allow observers to carry out measurements on entangled states that lead to a violation of the chsh inequality : @xmath57 an identical conclusion holds for single - particle entangled principal system .",
    "the calculations are the same as long as the reference frame does not contain any vacuum .",
    "we have derived conditions for violating the chsh inequality in the presence of particle - number ssr and we further study the properties of reference frames activating the violation .",
    "we show here that the minimal _ separable _ reference frame allowing violation contains two particles in total .    relaxing for a moment the separability requirement , eq .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) shows that the minimal reference has only one particle in total .",
    "namely , any state @xmath58 with @xmath59 has a non - vanishing parameter @xmath33 .",
    "however , the application of the ppt criterion for entanglement @xcite reveals that @xmath35 is entangled for all @xmath60 .",
    "when entangled states are used as references , it is unclear whether the violation of a bell inequality is due to the entanglement of the principal system or the reference frame .    for this reason we consider a reference frame with at most two particles : @xmath61 where as before @xmath62 . since the definition of eq .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) involves only the real part of the off - diagonal elements , we choose the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 to be real , i.e. @xmath65 , and we have used @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) .",
    "the application of the ppt criterion reveals that the state @xmath5 is separable if and only if @xmath67 therefore , for all separable reference frames activating the violation , @xmath68 , there must be some mixture of the two - particle state ( @xmath69 ) . note that the same argument applies to @xmath70 and",
    "one concludes that separable reference states of the form ( [ minimal ] ) enabling the violation must contain some vacuum .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that an arbitrary mixture of any pure two - qubit entangled state with ` colored noise ' @xmath71 is always entangled  @xcite .",
    "a useful mathematical tool which illustrates and generalizes the results presented so far is the twirling operation .",
    "twirling @xmath72 eliminates the coherences that are not compatible with ssr : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a projector on a subspace with a fixed number of particles @xmath3 .",
    "this operation describes the lack of a reference frame enabling access to the phase information of the probability amplitudes .",
    "the usefulness of twirling is best illustrated by considering states that can be prepared via ssr - locc .",
    "a simple proof demonstrates that they can not activate chsh violation .",
    "a ssr - locc reference frame commutes with local particle number operators and therefore it is invariant under the action of local twirlings , @xmath75 .",
    "this implies for the coherence parameter @xmath76 where the last equality follows from the fact that @xmath77 because @xmath78 contain only off - diagonal elements in the particle - number basis .",
    "note that the operator @xmath79 conserves total particle number and therefore it is invariant under global twirling , @xmath80 .",
    "all states satisfying ssr are of the form @xmath81 , where now @xmath5 need not have a fixed number of particles . therefore , @xmath82 where we have used the cyclic property of trace .",
    "this means that in order to calculate @xmath33 for a ssr respecting reference frame @xmath83 , we can use in eq .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) any state @xmath5 whose twirling gives @xmath83 .",
    "twirling allows further study of separable reference frames .",
    "note that the minimal reference frame of two particles we have derived in eq .",
    "( [ minimal ] ) activates the violation but does not lead to maximal violation .",
    "indeed , the highest value of @xmath33 for entangled reference states ( [ minimal ] ) is @xmath84 and for separable reference states eq .",
    "( [ ppt_v ] ) implies @xmath85 , whereas the maximal violation of the chsh inequality allowed by quantum theory @xmath86 @xcite requires @xmath87 .",
    "note also that the tsirelson bound of @xmath86 implies that @xmath88 .    here",
    "we show that there are separable reference frames allowing maximal violation of the chsh inequality with an entangle state .",
    "first note that all separable states satisfying ssr are of the form @xmath89 , with @xmath90 where @xmath91 need not have a fixed number of particles .",
    "this follows from the fact that global twirling is an locc operation ( but not ssr - locc ) and as such can not produce entanglement .",
    "we now derive the separable reference frames that maximize the coherence parameter @xmath33 .",
    "( [ coherence ] ) is linear in @xmath5 , @xmath33 is maximal for a pure product state @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that only the real part enters ( [ coherence ] ) , it is sufficient to consider states with real coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 . for such pure states @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath0 and @xmath98 denoting the dimensionality of the reference of alice and bob respectively , i.e. the maximal number of particles in their reference frames , and we put @xmath66 . to find the maximum of @xmath33 ,",
    "it is now sufficient to optimize @xmath99 , because @xmath100 has the same form and optimization over bob s state is independent of that over alice s .",
    "note that for states with real coefficients @xmath101 and therefore @xmath102 .",
    "the only non - vanishing elements of matrix @xmath103 are a strip of identities above and below its diagonal , and therefore it is a hermitian matrix .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath99 is attained for @xmath104 being the eigenvector of @xmath103 with the highest eigenvalue .",
    "the amplitudes of the optimal state read @xmath105 and its maximal eigenvalue gives @xmath106 for small references containing at most one particle on both sides @xmath107 we find @xmath108 in agreement with the results of section @xmath109 on minimal reference frames .",
    "if the references of alice and bob are both unbounded , eq .  ( [ max_fn ] ) implies that @xmath110 and the violation of the chsh inequality approaches its maximum . practically , for @xmath111 particles in each reference frame , @xmath112 .",
    "the references for violation of bell inequality were also studied in  @xcite in the context of directional reference frames , finding that in the limit of unbounded reference frame , maximal violation can be achieved .",
    "we stress that in our case the corresponding limit is twofold : to maximally violate chsh inequality the reference has to be prepared jointly , and it should be unbounded .",
    "let us now discuss the relation between @xmath113 and the non - locality of reference frames as captured by siv  @xcite . we show that violation of the chsh inequality is a witness of non - zero siv in the reference frame and that the amount of siv in small references gives an upper bound on the chsh violation .",
    "the siv of a pure state @xmath114 is defined as the variance of local number of particles @xmath115 the factor of @xmath116 is introduced for normalization : one unit of siv is defined for the state @xmath117 . since siv is symmetric with respect to permutation of the parties , one can equally consider the variance of the local particle number on bob s side ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "pure states that have non - zero siv can not be prepared via ssr - locc and this is the property of reference frames we are interested in .",
    "however , such pure states are always entangled , whereas we insist on separability of the reference frame .",
    "therefore we must consider mixed states . just like entanglement , for mixed states another measure of siv is required .",
    "we shall use the variance of formation defined as  @xcite @xmath119 where the ensembles of pure states @xmath120 obey ssrs . as a measure of the off - diagonal terms in the density matrix",
    ", we can consider @xmath33 , or equivalently bell inequality violation , as a witness of non - zero siv .",
    "moreover , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for states ( [ minimal ] ) the variance of formation reads @xmath121 with real @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "accordingly , one can directly relate siv to @xmath122 as @xmath123 therefore , the corresponding states with vanishing siv have also vanishing @xmath33 .",
    "our last topic is the experimental verification of bell inequality violations under ssrs and the need for new experiments .",
    "we relate this by commenting on current experiments related to the bell inequality and single - photon non - locality  @xcite .",
    "although not intended to violate a bell inequality under an ssr , these experiments may be seen as such for ( an induced ) photon - number ssr @xcite . in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , a single photon is directed onto a balanced beam - splitter producing ( it is hoped ) a non - local state of one photon . in each output port of this first beam - splitter there is another balanced beam - splitter with a ( reference ) coherent state directed at its second input port ( see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "one considers correlations between the number of photons registered in detectors placed in the output ports of the second set of beam - splitters .",
    "the experimental realizations  @xcite differ from the proposal  @xcite in that the secondary beam - splitters may be unbalanced .",
    "note that in principle the possible measurement results are unbounded , and therefore the chsh inequality can not be applied .",
    "it turns out that the correlation functions violate the chsh inequality only for small mean number of photons in the coherent states , in which case the events of having many photons in the detectors are rare and the chsh inequality becomes applicable .",
    "this , however , opens up an effective detection loophole which allows for a local hidden variable model .",
    "let us denote by @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) reflectivity of the first ( second ) beam - splitter supplied with a coherent state .",
    "the corresponding transmittances are : @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "it is assumed that both coherent states have the same mean number of photons @xmath128 and relative phase @xmath129 .",
    "the correlation function between the number of photons measured behind the two beam - splitters reads @xmath130 using this expression in the chsh parameter , one finds that the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is optimal in the sense that it is best to choose balanced beam - splitters @xmath131 .",
    "any other values of @xmath132 and @xmath125 lead to smaller values of the chsh parameter .",
    "in particular , the assumption of ref .",
    "@xcite that after the beam - splitter a photon may have equal likelihood to have come from a single photon ` beam ' or a coherent state , i.e. @xmath133 leads to no violation for all values of @xmath128 .",
    "for the balanced beam - splitters the inequality is violated if @xmath134 , which translates into the critical probability of vacuum in the coherent state @xmath135 .",
    "using such coherent states it is quite rare to measure two photons in a setup and one may utilize this effective detection loophole to explain the observed results with , e.g. , the model of gisin  @xcite .",
    "we therefore hope this research will stimulate further experiments testing bell violation in the presence of ssrs .",
    "ideally one would use systems with natural ssrs such as massive particles or charges .",
    "however , studies of partial superselection can also be performed through controlled decoherence , as decoherence between different subspaces can be seen as a type of ssr .",
    "we have studied the effects of restrictions imposed by ssrs on bell inequality violation .",
    "we found that the violation primarily depends on how a reference frame is prepared and only secondarily on its size .",
    "even unbounded reference frames do not lead to bell violation if they are prepared via ssr - locc and therefore are strictly classically correlated according to quantum discord and similar measures .",
    "this condition was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the violation ; that is reference frames enable the violation of a bell inequality if and only if they can not be prepared via ssr - locc .",
    "the violation can be achieved with separable reference frames explicitly consistent with particle - number superselection , the minimal such reference containing up to two particles .",
    "we linked the violation to the amount of non - locality in the reference frame as captured by siv .",
    "it would be interesting to study how other subfields of quantum theory , e.g. quantum tomography , are modified in the presence of superselection .",

    "we present local dichotomic measurements compatible with particle - number ssr which lead to the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) of the main text .",
    "alice measures a local observable parameterized by angle @xmath140 : @xmath141 where the eigenstates are defined as follows : @xmath142 for @xmath143 ; @xmath144 for @xmath145 ; @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "these observables are compatible with the ssr because all the eigenstates contain a fixed total number of particles @xmath148 .",
