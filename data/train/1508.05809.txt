    "the synthesis of graphene and the experimental measurements of its outstanding properties@xcite opened a pathway to explore and synthesize other single layer or few layers two dimensional ( 2d ) materials such as hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , molybdenum disulphide@xcite and phosphorene , a single layer of black phosphorus@xcite .",
    "furthermore the concept of van der waals ( vdw ) heterostructure has emerged@xcite , layers of 2d materials , which interact by means of vdw forces , are piled up , aiming to provide a suitable set of electronic and structural properties .",
    "recently heterostructures conformed by vertically stacked layers of graphene / hbn / graphene have been successfully synthesized@xcite , in these cases the different lattice constants and/or a relative rotation angle ( rra ) between layer lead to moir patterns that are observed in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images .",
    "the synthesis of few layer graphene by chemical methods@xcite , for instance , shows quite often a rotation between graphene layers with respect to the bernal or ab stacking .",
    "this gives rise to a moir pattern with a periodicity that can be associated with the rra between layers .",
    "this structure is known as twisted bilayer graphene ( tbg ) and it has been extensively studied due to its peculiar electronic properties@xcite .    in tbg , there is a so - called aa region where the stacking is similar to aa bilayer graphene , with one atom exactly above another atom of the other layer , and another region with ab stacking , the ab region . between the aa and ab regions the stacking looks like two random slipped layers .",
    "the size of the tbg unit cell ( uc ) and of the aa region is increased for low rra and the system can be thought as a large aa region surrounded by ab areas , as depicted in fig.[xyz](a ) .",
    "low energy electrons are localized in the aa region as they can not easily penetrate the barrier formed by the ab stacking@xcite .",
    "the local density of states is significantly larger at the aa site for very low angles and this is precisely the region one observe in stm images@xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum also depends on the rra . for large rra ( @xmath2 )",
    ", the system behaves as if the two layers were uncoupled with a linear energy dispersion like in monolayer graphene .",
    "below @xmath3 there is a constant reduction of the fermi velocity of charge carriers and close to @xmath4 the spectrum shows zero - velocity flat bands . scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) measurements have shown angle dependent van hove singularities(vhs ) near the fermi level@xcite consistent with the behavior predicted by theoretical methods@xcite .    there have been recently several proposals to exploit the properties of graphene by intercalation of metals .",
    "an enhancement of the out of plane magnetic anisotropy have been observed in intercalated cobalt atoms between graphene and ir(111 ) substrate@xcite , the anisotropy also depends on the specific site of the unit cell where the co atoms are deposited@xcite . in some cases the intercalated co atoms",
    "forms a quasi - periodic array of trimers between graphene adlayer and the sic(0001 ) surface@xcite . besides",
    ", the geometry of adatoms adsorbed on the graphene surface , might play a very important role on the formation of quantum spin and anomalous hall phases in graphene@xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose to take advantage of the moir structure in twisted bilayer graphene to create a periodic array of intercalated transition metal(tm ) atoms .",
    "if there is any energetic preference for the atoms to be localized in a given region between the layers of the twisted unit cell it might be possible to control the distance between them by manipulating the rra between layers , allowing or not the interaction between atoms and controlling the electronic / magnetic properties of the system .",
    "we examine , based on _ ab initio _ total energy calculations , the energetic stability and the electronic properties of tms ( tm = mo , ru , co , and pt ) intercalated between tbg layers .",
    "we found that mo and ru atoms exhibit an energetic preference for the aa stacking region ( tm@xmath5 ) of the twisted bilayer unit cell , while no such a preference is found for co and pt .",
    "this suggest that mo and ru intercalated atoms might form a quasi - periodic triangular array embedded in the twisted layers . at the same time the net magnetic moment of mo ,",
    "ru and co atoms are somewhat quenched upon their intercalation , for instance , we found a magnetic moment of 0.3@xmath0 for ru adatoms intercalated in the aa stacking region . through stm simulation , we show that there is an increase of the electronic density of states on the ( graphene ) c atoms bonded to the tm incorporation sites .",
    "the system we studied is composed of two coupled graphene layers with a given rra between them .",
    "we built a commensurate unit cell following a procedure exposed in several previous works@xcite .",
    "starting from a stacked ab bilayer graphene one rotate a lattice point to an equivalent location , a vector @xmath6 is rotated to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the graphene bilayer lattice vectors ; _",
    "n_,_m _ are integers .",
    "these integers are the only information needed to completely characterize the unit cell , the rotating angle , the unit cell vectors , and the numbers of atoms in the uc can be expressed in terms of them@xcite .",
    "the uc constructed this way contains one site , known as aa , where one atom is exactly above another atom of the other layer , there is another site , ab , where an atom of the top layer is exactly in the center of a lower layer hexagon , we have also a ba site , equivalent to the ab site but with the difference that an atom in the lower layer is in the center of an hexagon of the upper layer , there is also another area of the uc where the stacking is none of the above mentioned we call it slipped ab ( sab ) , see fig . [ xyz](a ) . as the uc gets larger , very small rra , the number of atoms with almost exact aa or ab character increases@xcite creating large regions with almost the same stacking .",
    "the distance between two aa regions ( periodicity of the superlattice ) can be calculated by the equation @xmath10 , where @xmath11  and @xmath12 is the rra between layers .",
    "the calculations were performed within the density functional theory ( dft ) approach , as implemented in the quantum - espresso package  @xcite .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a plane - wave basis set , with an energy cutoff of 35  ry .",
    "the twisted graphene bilayers were simulated considering supercells with 148 ( tgb-148 ) and 244 ( tgb-244 ) atoms , corresponding to rra ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and vacuum regions of 14 .",
    "the atomic positions were fully relaxed , by including van der waals ( vdw ) interactions within the self - consistent vdw - df approach as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the structural relaxations",
    "we have considered a force convergence tolerance of 15mev /  and the brillouin zone ( bz ) was sampled by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) * k*-points in the case of tgb-148 ( tgb-244 ) . after the structural relaxations ,",
    "spin polarized calculations were performed with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) * k*-points bz sampling in the case of tgb-148 ( tgb-244 ) .",
    "we begin examining the electronic and structural properties of the twisted bilayer graphene crystal in comparison with recent experimental and theoretical findings . in fig .",
    "[ xyz](a ) we show the structural model of tgb-148 , indicating the aa and ab stacking regions . at equilibrium ,",
    "the averaged interlayer distance ( @xmath19 ) is 3.679 ; slightly larger than the distance obtained for perfect bilayer graphene ( ab or bernal stacking ) .",
    "there are no chemical bonds between the graphene sheets , the interlayer interaction is governed by vdw forces , we found a binding energy of 27mev / c - atom very close to the experimental value of graphite@xcite . in the case of tgb-148 ,",
    "rra = @xmath13 , a slight renormalization of the fermi velocity and the presence of vhs , associated with the m point of the bz are expected@xcite .",
    "the energy of these vhs depends on the rra , diminishing as the angle gets lower@xcite .",
    "we found that the vhs lie at @xmath20ev with respect to the dirac point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xyz](b ) in agreement with previous experimental results@xcite .",
    "the moir structure gives rise to a periodic potential that have a huge impact on the electronic dispersion and at the same time promotes a charge density redistribution confining low energy electrons to the aa region , producing the bright spot observed in stm experiments on graphite or tbg@xcite .",
    "the origin of these bright spots were the subject of a debate not so long ago@xcite .",
    "two theories were vindicated : ( i ) there is an increase of the electronic density of states around the aa region , when compared with the ab area and ( ii ) the aa and ab regions present different equilibrium geometries , and the interlayer distances @xmath19 ( topographic corrugation ) are different .",
    "both arguments are valid and indeed , ( i ) can be verified in fig .",
    "[ xyz](c ) , by projecting the electronic dos on the c atoms near the aa ( c@xmath5 ) and ab ( c@xmath21 ) stacking regions .",
    "the electronic density of states is larger on c@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , comparing the equilibrium geometries , we find that the interlayer distance in the aa region ( @xmath22 ) is larger by 0.04  than in the ab one ( @xmath23 ) , as proposed in ( ii ) . by reducing the twist - angle to 7.34@xmath24 ( tgb-244 ) ,",
    "the lateral distance between the aa and ab regions increases , when compared with tgb-148 , and we find practically the same ( averaged ) interlayer distance , 3.681 .",
    "however , the interlayer distance in aa region increases to @xmath25 , while in the ab region we find practically the same distance ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these small changes in the interlayer distances suggest that the origin of the stm images is mainly electronic rather than geometrical@xcite .",
    "we found pertinent to investigate whether this behavior facilitates the creation of periodic arrays of intercalated atoms between twisted graphene layers . to such end",
    "we studied the energetic stability of transition metal atoms ( tms : mo , ru , co , and pt ) intercalated at different sites of the tbg unit cell .",
    "a measure of the energetic stability is the binding energy of the tms embedded in the twisted systems , the binding energy ( @xmath27 ) can be obtained from : @xmath28 + e[{\\rm tm } ] - e[{\\rm tm / tbg}].\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] is the total energy of the final system , a tbg intercalated by a tm atom .",
    "@xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] are the total energies of the separated components , a tbg and an isolated tm atom , respectively .",
    "we calculated the binding energy at several locations within the uc and found that for co and pt the differences are small , there is not any clear preference for any region .",
    "however for mo and ru the difference can be as large as 1 ev , and the highest binding energy is obtained in the aa region and the lowest in the ab one . in the rest of the uc the results are in between these two extreme values .",
    "in addition we have calculated the binding energy but with the tm atoms adsorbed on the surface site(an atom on top of the upper layer ) .",
    "we obtained , for the tbg-148 structure , @xmath27 of 3.48 , and 2.47 for mo and ru adatoms lying on the hollow site of the aa region , and 1.44ev for pt adatom on the bridge site .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the ones obtained for the intercalated atoms .       in addition",
    ", we compare the total energies for ru/ and mo / tgb-148 embedded in aa - like regions , indicated as aa and aa@xmath32 in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the atomic positions of the tm and tgb are free to relax .",
    "those aa and aa@xmath32 configuration are very close in energy ; we find differences of 0.007 and 0.024ev .",
