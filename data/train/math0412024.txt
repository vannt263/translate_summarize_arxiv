    "the reader will find throughout the text several more or less explicit questions , but none of them are stated as `` official '' problems or conjectures .",
    "this choice is based on the idea that the proof often comes together with the question ( or the theorem ) , and , moreover , the young researchers should keep in mind that the surroundings and the applications of a given problem should be the main motivations for its study , and not the question itself ( or its author ) .    throughout the paper",

    "it is clear that , up to isomorphism , this group depends only on the genus @xmath10 of @xmath0 , on the number @xmath11 of components of @xmath1 , and on the cardinality @xmath3 of @xmath9 .",
    "so , we may write @xmath12 in place of @xmath13 , and simply @xmath14 for @xmath15 .    let @xmath16 be the _ standard disk _ , and let @xmath2 be a finite collection of @xmath3 punctures in the interior of @xmath17 .",

    "now , the equality @xmath34 is the source of the several questions that the reader will find in the paper .",
    "we start this section with a brief presentation of garside groups .",
    "our presentation of the subject draws in many ways from the work of dehornoy @xcite as well as @xcite , and , like all treatments of garside groups , is inspired ultimately by the seminal papers of garside @xcite , on braid groups , and brieskorn and saito @xcite , on artin groups .",

    "the notion of a garside group was introduced by dehornoy and the author @xcite in a slightly restricted sense , and , later , by dehornoy @xcite in the larger sense which is now generally used .",
    "as pointed out before , the theory of garside groups is largely inspired by the papers of garside @xcite , which treated the case of the braid groups , and brieskorn and saito @xcite , which generalized garside s work to artin groups .",

    "other interesting examples include all torus link groups ( see @xcite ) and some generalized braid groups associated to finite complex reflection groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "garside groups have many attractive properties : solutions to the word and conjugacy problems are known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , they are torsion - free ( see @xcite ) , they are biautomatic ( see @xcite ) , and they admit finite dimensional classifying spaces ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "right - angled artin groups ( also known as graph groups or free partially commutative groups ) have been widely studied , and their applications extend to various domains such as parallel computation , random walks , and cohomology of groups .",

    "define a _ geometric representation _ of @xmath95 to be a homomorphism from @xmath95 to some mapping class group .",
    "although i do not believe that mapping class groups are either artin groups or garside groups , the theory of geometric representations should be of interest from the perspective of both mapping class groups and artin ( resp .",

    "for instance , it is not known which artin groups ( resp .",
