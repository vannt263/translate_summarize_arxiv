    "they presented , the one closer to v5588 sgr is - by far - nova sgr 2003 ( = v4745 sgr ) , that displayed five bright secondary maxima but had a completely different spectroscopic evolution ( see below ) .",
    "we first discuss the underlying smooth photometric evolution of v5588 sgr as if belonging to an otherwise normal nova , and then turn our attention to the secondary maxima .",

    "the time ( @xmath10.2 days ) and brightness of the _ normal _ maximum ( as opposed to the subsequent six secondary maxima , labelled 1 to 6 in figure  1 ) as determined from these interpolations are :    @xmath27    the epoch of maximum occurred at later times for longer wavelength bands , the maximum in @xmath13 coming @xmath51.2 days after that in the @xmath10 band .",

    "( 2010 ) who noted how it closely followed the expectations for the initial fireball expansion phase .",
    "at maximum the nova appeared faint and highly reddened , which contributed to limited interest among observers and inhibited monitoring programs for e.g. in the x rays or uv .",
    "a wider interest arose only after the first secondary maxima were reported , but at that time the nova had already dropped in brightness .",

    "novae the @xmath10@xmath7@xmath2 color did not change much in phase with the observed cycle , while @xmath2@xmath7@xmath13 varied in a way reminiscent of pulsation ( bluer at maximum , redder at minimum ) .",
    "such a feature could be related to the pre - maximum halts observed in some novae ( e.g. hounsell et al .",
    "theoretical investigations are beginning to explore in some greater detail the early lightcurve of novae , and short - lived features similar to the pulsation - like oscillation we observed in v5588 sgr are emerging in the computations , as in those of hillman et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the @xmath12-band lightcurve of v5588 sgr in figure  1 looks quite different from that in the other bands .",
    "this is due to the presence of an extremely strong h@xmath8 in emission .",
    "while other remission lines counted for a minimal fraction of the flux recorded over the @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath13 bands , the h@xmath8 dominated the flux recorded through the @xmath12 band , from 30% on our first spectrum ( day @xmath72.4 ) to 79% on the last ( sep 2 ) .",
    "the near - ir photometric evolution of v5588 sgr is presented in figure  3 where our data from table  3 is supplemented with public data from kanata observatory 1.5 m telescope . in the near - ir v5588 sgr behaved similarly to the optical : a smooth underlying decline on which are superimposed the secondary maxima . over the limited period of time covered by figure  3 , the @xmath29@xmath7@xmath26 color slowly and smoothly increased by only a small amount , indicating that no warm dust condensed in the ejecta .",
    "the secondary maxima were not accompanied by significant @xmath29@xmath7@xmath26 color changes .",
    "even if the time of primary maximum is not well covered by @xmath22 data , nonetheless figure  3 suggests that in the near - ir it occurred later than in the optical , in accordance with expectations from an expanding fireball ( e.g. seaquist & bode 2008 ) . an important feature displayed by figure  3",
    "is how the secondary maxima occurred about two days later in @xmath22 than at optical wavelengths .",
    "such a shift and its amount suggest that broad - band emission during sdm were dominated by expanding photospheres .",
    "van den bergh and younger ( 1987 ) derived a mean intrinsic color @xmath30=@xmath310.23 @xmath10.06 for novae at maximum , and @xmath30=@xmath70.02 @xmath10.04 for novae at @xmath32 .",

    "the corresponding reddenings are @xmath0=1.58 and 1.54 , for a mean value @xmath0=1.56 ( @xmath10.1 ) , which will be adopted in the rest of this paper . the corresponding extinction would be @xmath34=5.16 mag following the reddening relations calibrated by fiorucci and munari ( 2003 ) .",
    "the high reddening affecting v5588 sgr is confirmed by the oi emission line ratio in the infrared observations of rudy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and by the flux ratio of paschen to brackett emission lines in our near - ir spectra .",
    "both the rate of decline and the observed magnitude 15 days past maximum are popular methods of estimating the distance to a nova .",
    "the relation @xmath35 as most recently calibrated by downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) provides a distance to v5588 sgr of 7.8 kpc for @xmath3 , and 7.5 kpc for @xmath4 .",

    "buscombe & de vaucouleurs ( 1955 ) suggested that all novae have the same absolute magnitude 15 d after maximum light .",
    "its most recent calibration by downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) returns 8.1 kpc as the distance to v5588 sgr .",
    "the straight average of these four determinations is an absolute magnitude m@xmath36=@xmath77.2 and a distance of 7.6  kpc , that we will adopt in this paper .",
    "such a large distance is consistent with the upper limit of negative radio detections discussed by krauss et al .",

    "considering that the 2mass survey did not detect stars fainter than 13.5 mag in @xmath26 within 2 arcmin of the position of the nova , we may only exclude a cool giant as the donor star in v5588 sgr , while a sub - giant and a main sequence donor star are equally allowed by the 2mass limiting magnitude .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached considering the @xmath2@xmath521.1 upper limit to the nova renmant brightness from our latest observation on july 17 , 2014 .",
    "the most striking feature displayed by v5588 sgr is undoubtedly the six secondary maxima ( sdm for short ) that adorn the lightcurve in figure  1 , with figure  5 providing a zooming on them all .",
    "their basic properties are summarized in table  5 .",
    "the sdm look similar , although not identical .",
    "the time interval between them increased along the series , with an interval of 18 days between the first two and twice as much ( 42 days ) between the last two .",
    "similarly , the duration of sdm also increased along the series , from fwhm=2.1 days for the first to fwhm=8.6 days for the last .",
    "the photometric colors at peak sdm brightness changed along the six episodes .",
    "compared to the underlying normal decline , the first three sdm were redder by 0.5 mag in @xmath10@xmath7@xmath2 and bluer by the same mount in @xmath2@xmath7@xmath13 , indicating that the energy distribution of the continuum source associated to the sdm was sharply peaking at @xmath2-band wavelengths . the color change associated with the fourth sdm was similarly directed but of lower amplitude , while the last two sdm were not accompanied by significant color changes . in the near - ir , a minimal blueing in @xmath29@xmath7@xmath26 color was observed during the second sdm , while the third saw no changes at all ( cf .",
    "figure  3 ) .",
    "the first two sdm were brighter than the primary maximum of the nova in all @xmath10@xmath2@xmath12@xmath13 bands , and the third equal in @xmath10@xmath2@xmath13 bands .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath52 days time delay between peak brightness at optical and near - ir wavelengths ( cf .",
    "figure  3 ) suggests that broad - band emission during an sdm was governed by photospheric expansion as in a fireball .",
    "the projected areas of the expanding fireballs associated with the first two sdm were therefore larger than the one for the primary maximum .",
    "the very rapid evolution of sdm in comparison with the underlying normal nova evolution , suggests that a much lower amount of material was ejected at a much larger velocity than at primary maximum .",

    "this agrees with the fact that the lightcurves in figure  1 do not show the typical flattening of the brightness decline . in feii - type novae",
    ", the transition from optically thick ( emitting mostly permitted lines ) to optically thin ejecta ( dominated by nebular lines ) occurs between 3 and 4 mag below maximum , when the photometric decline all of a sudden changes from rapid to a much flatter one ( mclaughlin 1960 , munari 2012 ) .",
    "while during the optically thick decline the gas in the ejecta is just mainly recombining , during the optically thin phase the hard radiation field from the central wd permeates the ejecta with a strong re - ionization action .",
    "there is available on the web , a spectrum for april 12 obtained with the kanata 1.5 m telescope that shows how he / n - type spectrum was already emerging at that time ( day + 10 ) , when v5588 sgr had just ended the first sdm and was back to the smooth underlying decline ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the appearance of the he / n - type spectrum coincided with the nova entering the evolutionary phase characterized by the sdm .",
    "the last of our spectra still showing ( feeble ) traces of the feii - type spectrum is that for day + 118 , after that date the recorded spectrum is only that of a he / n nova .",

    "first of all v5588 sgr displayed _ narrow _ emission lines during the feii phase , certainly not larger than seen in normal feii novae .",
    "as shown in figures  7 and 8 , the fwhm of balmer and feii emission lines kept lower than 1000 km / s throughout the whole feii phase . in hybrid novae ,",
    "the fwhm of emission lines during the feii phase is at least twice as large as seen in v5588 sgr , and remain similarly broad during the subsequent he / n phase . secondly , v5588 sgr evolved slowly for a he / n .",
    "the @xmath40 characteristic times of he / n novae are short , from a few days to a maximum of a few weeks , while for v5588 sgr it was a few months ( 2.5 months in @xmath2 and 3 in @xmath10 band , see eq.(2 ) above ) .",
    "in addition , the width at half maximum of emission lines in he / n novae is usually equal or larger than 2500 km / sec , and their profile is more fat - topped than gaussian - like . in v5588 sgr the hei and heii lines are stable at fwhm@xmath51100 km / sec through out the recorded evolution , with a profile well fitted by a gaussian , marginally double - peaked with a velocity separation of @xmath5400 km / sec .",
    "finally during the advanced decline of he / n novae , the intensity of heii emission line is usually larger than h@xmath9 . in v5588 sgr",
    ", heii never grew in intensity to more than half of h@xmath9 .",
    "the hybrid classification from optical spectra is not in contrast with available observations in the near - ir .",
    "our first @xmath22 spectra were obtained on day + 24.5 ( when optical spectra were already dominated by he / n features and the signatures from the feii phase were weakening ) , and their appearance is typical of he / n novae , as are all the other near - ir spectra we obtained ( figures 9 , 10 and 11 ) . on the other hand , rudy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) labelled their near - ir spectrum of v5588 sgr for day + 25.5 as that of a feii nova , without the carbon lines .",
    "the absence of carbon lines is obvious in our spectra .",
    "as shown in banerjee and ashok ( 2012 ) , the feii class of novae early after outburst , are distinguished from the he / n class by displaying a large number of strong carbon lines in each of the @xmath29,@xmath25 and @xmath26 bands .",
    "most prominent among these ci lines are the 1.165 , 1.175 @xmath21 m region features in the @xmath29 band and the strong cluster of lines beyond br10 in the @xmath25 band in the 1.74 to 1.80 @xmath21 m region .",
    "examples of these ci lines can be seen in the spectra of several feii type novae viz .",
    ", v1280 sco and v2615 oph ( das et al . 2008 ; das , banerjee @xmath24 ashok 2009 ) , v2274 cyg ( rudy et al . 2003 ) , v1419 aql ( lynch et al . 1995 ) and v5579 sgr ( raj , ashok @xmath24 banerjee 2011 ) .",
    "earlier near - ir spectra , obtained around primary maximum , would have been highly valuable to check if the feii type characterizing optical wavelengths at that time was similarly dominating the near - ir .      as noted by williams ( 1992 ) , the advanced evolution of he / n - type novae proceeds in one of three distinct ways : ( @xmath18 ) permitted emission lines simply fade away and nebular emission lines are not observed , ( @xmath19 ) strong [ neiii ] 3869 , 3868   o [ nev ] 3346 , 3426   lines emerge , resulting in a _ neon _",
    "nova , or ( @xmath41 ) coronal forbidden lines such as [ fex ] 6375 develop .",
    "v5588 sgr did not show usual nebular lines .",
    "it also did not develop [ nev ] , and only feeble traces of [ neiii ] and [ neiv ] were visible , therefore it did not turn into a neon nova .",
    "it instead developed prominent [ fex ] , stronger than [ fevii ] 6087   at peak intensity on day + 139 spectrum in figure  7 , fully qualifying v5588 sgr as a _",
    "coronal line _ nova .",
    "[ arx ] 5534 was probably present too , and [ fexi ] 3987 could marginally be so .",
    "[ arxi ] 6019 , [ nixv ] 6702 , [ nixiii ] 5115   which were prominent in nova rs oph ( wallerstein & garnavich 1986 , iijima 2009 ) were not present , while not much can be said for [ fexiv ] 5303   given the presence of nearby and strong [ cav ] 5309  .",
    "[ fex ] became visible for the first time on our spectrum for day + 18 , shortly before the onset of the second sdm , simultaneous with the first appearance of heii in emission , signalling the ejecta were turning optically transparent and nuclear burning was proceeding in the wd envelope . under such conditions ,",
    "novae are usually detected as strong super - soft x - ray sources ( krautter 2008 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the swift satellite did not observe v5588 sgr until much later .",
    "the intensity of [ fex ] increased with time and in pace with heii ( cd figure  7 ) , peaking in intensity on our spectrum for day + 139 ( 2011 aug 19 ) , obtained during the normal decline between fifth and sixth sdm .",
    "quite interestingly , on our last spectrum , obtained two weeks later ( day + 153 ) and right at the peak of sixth secondary maximum , both heii and [ fex ] are instead missing .",
    "we see two alternative explanation for this : either ( @xmath18 ) the nuclear burning on the surface of the wd stopped sometime between day + 139 and + 153 and the consequent rapid cooling brought the temperature of the wd below the threshold for producing heii and [ fex ] , or ( @xmath19 ) the material ejected during the sixth sdm temporarily obscured the view of the wd and inner regions of the ejecta , where the heii and [ fex ] form , or from where it was coming the hard radiation capable of forming them in the external ejecta .",
    "the time scale for recombination in the ejecta goes as : @xmath42 following ferland ( 2003 ) . at the critical density for [ fex ] ( logn@xmath43=9.7 @xmath44 )",
    ", the recombination time scale is very short , less than one hour for any reasonable choice of the electronic temperature @xmath45 .",
    "of course , after the switch - off of the nuclear burning , the envelope of the wd is still very hot and cools off gradually , so the input of high energy photons to the ejecta is not instantaneously stopped .",
    "nonetheless , there seem to be enough time between the spectra of + 139 and + 153 to allow enough cooling of the wd to stop producing [ fex ] lines from regions with an electron density close to the critical value .    however , [ fevii ] 6087   too disappeared from day + 153 spectrum .",
    "this line came from regions characterized by an electron density lower that its critical value ( logn@xmath46=7.6 @xmath44 ) but higher than that of absent [ oiii ] lines ( logn@xmath46=5.8 @xmath44 ) , so with a recombination time from a few hours up to a couple of months .",
    "the disappearance of [ fevii ] 6087   line could therefore pose a problem for alternative @xmath47 above .",
    "an even more serious problem comes from the text of an approved target of opportunity proposal ( available on the web ) for swift x - ray observations of v5588 sgr to be carried out in 2012 that states the nova was displaying at the time of proposal submission ( 2012 may 18 , or day + 411 ) a [ fex ] emission line half the intensity of [ fevii ] on optical spectra , and thus observations were requested to observe the expected super - soft x - ray emission .",
    "we are tempted to conclude that [ fex ] was still visible long after the end of our optical spectroscopic monitoring , and that the absence of [ fex ] and heii from the day + 153 spectrum at the peak of the sixth sdm was caused by optically thick material ejected during such sdm blocking the view toward inner ejecta and central star .",
    "unfortunately , for none of the other sdm there are optical spectra obtained during the rise in brightness or around maximum to check if this was a repeating pattern through all observed sdm .",
    "the emission lines of v5588 sgr displayed throughout the whole recorded outburst show a narrow profile , with fwhm@xmath51000 km / sec for both optical and near - ir spectra .",
    "however , sometimes a much broader and weak pedestal appeared at the bottom of the narrow and much stronger component .",
    "this is well seen in figure  8 , where the broad pedestal in obvious in the h@xmath8 profiles for days + 53.5 and + 56.5 , or the br@xmath48 and pa@xmath9 profiles for days + 24.5 and + 51.3 . on the h@xmath8 profiles of figure  8 , the pedestal has a trapezoidal shape , extending for @xmath6vel=3600 km / sec at the top and 4500 km / sec at the bottom .",
    "the shape is similar for br@xmath48 and pa@xmath9 , with reduced velocities : 2900 at the top and 3600 at the bottom .",
    "the limited resolution of our spectra does not allow to distinguish between a boxy , flat - topped profile and two separate emission symmetric with respect to the main component , in other words if the emission from the pedestal originates in a filled prolate volume or in a bipolar arrangement .",
    "a most important fact to note is that , both at optical and near - ir wavelengths , the broad pedestal to hydrogen lines is not seen in between sdm , or during their rising toward maximum and early decline from it , but only during the advanced decline from sdm maximum and before the return to the smooth decline between sdm .",
    "the broad component developed similarly for hei lines , as figure  11 well illustrates from @xmath26-band spectra : on apr 26 and may 23 , when the pedestal was present in br@xmath48 , it was so also for hei 2.0581 @xmath21 m , while on other dates only the narrow component was visible in hei as for br@xmath48 .",

    "these are the features at 1.6872 and 1.7414 @xmath21 m in the @xmath25 band and a @xmath26 band feature at @xmath5 2.089 @xmath21 m .",
    "both the @xmath25 band features are clearly seen in figure 3 and although their origin is not certain , they could possibly be due to fe ii .",
    "the 1.6872 @xmath21 m line is seen to slowly gain in strength to equal and even surpass the adjacent br11 line . in the near - infrared",
    ", there are a few feii lines seen in the spectra of novae , which are believed to be primarily excited by lyman @xmath8 and lyman continuum fluorescence . among these are the so - called `` one micron fe ii lines '' seen at around the 1 micron region in several novae ( rudy et al . 2000 and references therein ) . in addition , two other fe ii lines at 1.6872 and 1.7414 @xmath21 m in the @xmath25 band , have also proposed to be pumped by the same mechanism ( banerjee , das @xmath24 ashok 2009 ; bautista et al .",
    "the @xmath25 band lines are prominently detected in the 2006 outburst of recurrent nova rs oph ( banerjee , das @xmath24 ashok 2009 ) , in the slow nova v2540 oph ( rudy et al 2002a ) , in v574 pup ( naik et al . 2010 ) and possibly also in the recurrent nova ci aql ( lynch et al . 2004 ) .",
    "as the detections of these lines in individual objects increase , it becomes amply evident that these @xmath25 band lines could be present in the spectra of other novae too , but have evaded detection because of blending - especially when their widths are large - with the br 11 ( 1.6806 @xmath21 m ) line .",
    "an emission feature at @xmath52.090 @xmath21 m in the @xmath26 band is also seen in the spectra at most of the epochs of observation .",
    "two possible identifications may be considered for this line .",
    "first , it could be feii 2.0888 @xmath21 m , a line also seen in the nova v2615 oph ( das , banerjee @xmath24 ashok 2009)for which an excitation mechanism by lyman @xmath8 fluorescence was proposed .",
    "alternatively , this feature could be the [ mn xiv ] 2.0894 @xmath21 m coronal line which has been seen in a few instances in novae spectra during the coronal phase viz .",
    ", in nova v1974 cyg ( wagner @xmath24 depoy , 1996 ) and in rs oph ( banerjee , das @xmath24 ashok 2009 ) . it should be noted that the @xmath52.090 @xmath21 m line should not be confused with an unidentified line at 2.0996 @xmath21 m that has often been detected in novae and which still remains unidentified ( rudy et al .",
    "given the wide range of intriguing and unique features presented by v5588 sgr , it was unfortunate that the nova was so distant and suffered extinction to such an extent that it was rather faint at maximum .",
    "this inhibited raising widespread attention among observers and thereby allowing larger telescopes to provide higher resolution and more abundant spectral observations .",
    "the most fascinating aspect of v5588 sgr is undoubtedly the repeated presence of nearly identical secondary maxima .",
    "the body of evidence presented in this paper suggests that they resulted from ejection at high velocity of a limited amount of material .",
    "the rise toward sdm maximum corresponds to the initial expansion in optically thick conditions , the maximum brightness to the maximum projected area reached by the expanding pseudo - photosphere , and the decline by the material turning optically thin and dissolving into surrounding space .",
    "the extremely fast evolution of the sdm argues in favor of a limited amount of material being ejected during such episodes , with the rise to maximum taking generally less than one day and only a few days to complete the decline .",
    "it may also be argued that the ejection was in the form of a thin and almost empty shell .",
    "in fact , while its optically thick pseudo - photosphere attained a maximum a brightness in excess of that of the primary nova ejecta , as soon as it turned optically thin , its continuum emission dropped like a stone and the only emission line feature detectable was in the form of the weak pedestal , briefly seen in hydrogen and hei lines .",
    "it seems that the high velocity material ejected during sdm did not collide significantly with the pre - existing slow velocity normal nova ejecta .",
    "there are no obvious traces of shocked or decelerating gas in the optical and near - ir spectra .",
    "in addition , the swift x - ray satellite observed v5588 sgr seven times between 30 august 2011 ( while the nova was on the rise toward its sixth sdm ) and 24 july 2012 .",
    "the nova was only detected during the 2011 observations , at a very low average count rate of of 0.010 + /-",
    "0.002 c / s , in contrast with the expectations from high velocity sdm material slamming onto the normal nova ejecta .",
    "therefore , the material ejected during sdm either expanded and dissolved into the cavity left over by expanding normal ejecta or moved along spatial directions away from spatially confined main ejecta ( for ex . with the normal ejecta expanding on the plane of the sky in a bipolar shape , and the high velocity sdm material arranged orthogonal to this like in an equatorial ring or a spherical central blob ) .    only the latest theoretical models of thermonuclear runaways on novae ( e.g. hillmann et al . 2014 ) are able to produce the type of secondary maxima seen in v5588 sgr",
    ". their niche in the parameter space will need further exploration , and the extensive and accurate observational data here provided for v5588 sgr will surely help in fine tuning the models .",
    "external sources not usually accounted for by models on thermonuclear runaways on white dwarfs may also play a role , like for example the donor star being able to refuel the wd with short and repeated pulses of mass transfer .",
    "whatever the reason was , it is striking that the energy release during sdm ( at least the energy radiated through the optical bands , cf .",
    "figure  6 ) declined following an exponential pattern , while at the same time the breath of the sdm was increasing as it was the time interval between two successive ones , a pattern suggesting a relaxation mechanism . in the case of the donor star refueling the wd with pulses of mass transfer ,",
    "the exponential decline in energy radiated by sdm suggests that the amount of transferred mass followed a similar decline .",
    "such mass transfer episodes does not seem being triggered by orbital geometry ( like passages at periastron in a highly eccentric and long period orbit ) , because of the monotone increase in time separation between them poorly compares with the regularity of orbital revolutions .",
    "the evla radio observations summarized by krauss et al .",
    "( 2011c ) and the comparison with v4745 sgr ( nova 2003 n.1 ) , the only other known nova with a lightcurve resembling v5588 sgr , does not point to an easy solution . in fact , v5588 sgr was found to be radio quiet just before sdm n.2 and radio loud just before sdm n. 3 and 4 , and it was radio quiet during sdm n.5 and immediately after the end of sdm n.2 and n.3 . as noted by krauss et al .",
    "( 2011c ) such rapid and repeated on - off switch in radio emission can not be easily understood in the conventional modeling for radio emission of nova ejecta .",
    "both v5588 sgr and v4745 sgr displayed several sdm , over a similar time interval and of similar brightness .",
    "however , v4745 sgr begun as a feii nova and did not developed a he / n spectrum at later times , e.g. it was not an hybrid nova , and its emission lines were twice as wide as in v5588 sgr .",
    "in addition , while the spectra of v5588 sgr did not change during sdm other than for the appearance of the weak broad pedestal , the emission lines of v4745 sgr during sdm switched back to strong p - cyg absorption profiles as for the primary maximum ( csk et al .",
    "2005 , tanaka et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "a dedicated comparison of detailed properties of the few novae that displayed one or more sdm is well beyond the scope of this paper , but surely worth considering .",
    "while information like orbital period and orbital inclination or presence of wd modulation ( suggesting a significant magnetic field ) are available for some of these novae , the same will be hardly achievable for v5588 sgr given its faint magnitude in quiescence ( @xmath2@xmath5121 mag ) , requiring the largest available telescopes for the attempt .",
    "we would like to thank e. tamajo , p. valisa and p. ochner for assistance with some of the spectroscopic observations .",
