    "in a recent paper@xcite , we argued that a system of interacting cooper pairs may form a gapless nonsuperfluid liquid , i.e. a metallic state , in two dimensions at @xmath1 .",
    "we called this state a bose metal(bm ) .",
    "although such an idea might seem rather counter - intuitive offhand since a system of delocalised bosons _ typically _ forms a superfluid(sf ) state at @xmath1 , closer thinking suggests that it is not .",
    "a bose metal is possible in the same sense that a spin liquid is possible in quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "in fact , we showed that it is just another variety of a spin liquid : an @xmath2 spin liquid .    in amorphous superconducting films , particularly moge , metal - like states analogous to the ones in granular superconductors@xcite ,",
    "have been observed in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the fact that such a state exists as an intermediate phase between a superconductor(sc ) and an insulator(ins ) , as predicted in ref.@xcite , is already a good hint that the bose metal scenario might be applicable to these systems as well . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the arguments which were previously developed for the case of zero applied magnetic field , to the field tuned case .",
    "we show that the results of field tuned experiments in superconducting films , where such a metallic state has also been seen@xcite , also fit in with our concept of a bose metal .",
    "we first discuss ( section ii ) the fact that gauge field fluctuations present in the vortex system in the jja model play a key role in the formation of the bm state and show how generalized dissipation models can also similarly lead to an analogous bm state .",
    "we then discuss how the concept of the bm state may be generalized to the field tuned case .",
    "the observation of three phases in ref.@xcite is consistent with the bose metal scenario .",
    "this leads to the suggestion of new scaling formulae for resistivity across the sc - bm and bm - ins transitions .",
    "these are presented in section iii and are shown to work very well for the moge data . in section iv , we develop a phenomenological model for the metallic state based on the physics described above , which we find is in good agreement with the moge data . finally in section",
    "v we discuss the effective action and the low energy excitation spectrum of the bose metal state . here , we also address the issue of why the bm state has not been observed in the previous analyses of the jja model .",
    "_ dynamical gauge field fluctuations _ : in ref.@xcite , we considered a josephson junction array ( jja ) model with onsite and nearest neighbour repulsion for large cooper pair fillings and zero external gate voltage ( i.e. @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge fluctuation operator at the site @xmath5@xcite ) .",
    "we showed using the duality transformation relations that this model maps onto a _",
    "two_-component _ quantum _ plasma of vortices(@xmath6 ) and antivortices(@xmath7 ) , i.e. a set of _ non - relativistic _ bosons , moving in a dynamically fluctuating gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "this picture of vortices moving in a fluctuating gauge field is a simple quantum mechanical extension of the results of classical phase fluctuations in a 2-d superconductor . in the classical regime ,",
    "a 2-d superconductor ( with phase fluctuations ) maps onto a two component classical plasma ( @xmath9 ) undergoing screening by a static electric field ( @xmath10 ) , as described by kosterlitz and thouless(kt)@xcite . in the quantum regime",
    "two new effects are important:(a)the bose statistics of the vortices and antivortices allows for the possibility of their superfluidity ; and(b ) because of quantum fluctuations , the electric field is no more static but dynamical , i.e. @xmath11 and is associated with a corresponding magnetic field @xmath12 . hence , expressed in terms of vortices , in the quantum regime ,",
    "two processes are important : depairing of @xmath9 pairs ( or , blowing up of vortex loops in ( 2 + 1)-d ) and bose condensation of depaired vortices and antivortices , corresponding to the loss of phase order and growth of charge order for the cooper pairs , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the presence of dynamically fluctuating gauge field @xmath13 causes the vortices and antivortices to pick up random aharonov - bohm(ab ) phases @xmath14 which makes these two processes distinct from one another . if there were no fluctuating gauge field , then because of the quantum zero point motion , the vortices and antivortices would bose condense into a phase coherent state as soon as they unbind , i.e. the film becomes insulating . now because of the gauge field @xmath13 , the situation here is different .",
    "if the gauge field fluctuations are small , the dephasing induced by random ab phases is weak and superfluidity of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is retained . on the other hand ,",
    "if the gauge field fluctuations are very strong , then , because of the random ab phases , the unbound @xmath6 and @xmath7 fail to produce a phase coherent state , and the system is a non - superfluid liquid .",
    "the effects of these gauge field fluctuations may be seen very clearly in terms of a world line picture for the vortices(appendix a ) .",
    "we represent this as a bosonic system interacting with a fluctuating gauge field @xmath13 .",
    "the partition function is@xcite : @xmath15 \\right ) \\exp\\left(-s_{g}\\left(\\vec{a}\\right)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the gauge part of the action and @xmath17 is the permutation of the particles@xcite .",
    "this type of partition function may be obtained , for example , by substituting @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eqn.(15 ) in ref.@xcite , where @xmath20 is the vortex charge .",
    "the ab phase factor @xmath21 appears explicitly here .",
    "when the gauge field fluctuations are weak , this factor is close to @xmath22 .",
    "so , this case is very similar to the bose system without any gauge field , and the ground state is an entangled liquid , i.e. a superfluid ( appendix a ) .",
    "now , when the gauge field fluctuations become very large , the ab phase trapped by the bosons is of order @xmath23 ( modulo @xmath24 ) , and the phase factor appears in @xmath25 with fluctuating signs .",
    "this would cause cancellation of several terms in @xmath25 when entangled configurations are present , implying that such configurations enter the partition function with a low weight and are correspondingly high energy states , just like the fermionic case ( appendix a ) .",
    "so , in this case , the ground state is a disentangled liquid , i.e. a non - superfluid .",
    "phase separation is not possible because of the long - range interactions present in the ( original ) vortex bose system .",
    "hence , as gauge field fluctuations increases , there should be a phase transition from the superfluid to a non - superfluid state .",
    "this discussion makes explicit why random ab phases causes disentanglement .",
    "the non - superfluid state of bosons , thus obtained due to dephasing by random ab phases , is a liquid rather than a solid where the particles are localised by fluctuations , because the gauge field fluctuates with time .",
    "let us say that the vortices get localised by fluctuations . then , since they see a magnetic field that fluctuates with time , by faraday s law , they see an induced electric field as well . this electric field will knock the localised particles out of their positions .",
    "thus , the presence of a dynamically fluctuating gauge field in the quantum vortex system leads to the possibility of a non - sf _ liquid _ phase , and by duality@xcite , a consequent possibility of a metallic state for the cooper pairs , the original players in the system . because the vortices feel retardation effects due to gauge field fluctuations , they dissipate even in a pure system , thus leading to finite resitivity at @xmath1 .    in summary , the effect of ab phases induced by the gauge field fluctuations is to disorder the vortices and to create a _",
    "new _ variety of quantum liquid , some signatures of which we discuss in this paper .    _ effects of dissipation _ : the following four features about the bose metal scenario emerge from the description of the jja model above and in ref.@xcite:(i)when the bose metal is observed , it exists as an intermediate phase between the sc and the ins;(ii ) the observation of the bm phase is associated with two phase transitions : one from sc to bm and the other from bm to ins ; ( iii)the bm phase is dominated by dynamical gauge field(gf ) fluctuations , as felt by the vortices ; and(iv)there is a competition between gf fluctuations and quantum zero point motion of the vortices at the bm - ins phase boundary : in the ins phase , quantum zero point motion wins and the vortices are in the sf phase .    it has been suggested by mason and kapitulnik@xcite that dissipation effects will quite generally help the formation of a metallic like state for vortices in the quantum regime .",
    "we show here that the effects of a generalized dissipation model on the quantum motion of the vortices also maps onto a set of non - relativistic bosons moving in a dynamically fluctuating gauge field , just like the jja model .",
    "consider a generic dissipation model ( no static disorder ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 average vortex density .",
    "@xmath30 vortex charge , and the partition function is @xmath31 .",
    "the first term is the quantum zero point motion term ( also , known as the mass term ) ; the second term is the long - range ( logarithmic , in a pure system ) interaction among the vortices and the last term is the dissipation term .",
    "summation is implied in the dissipation term and @xmath32 , @xmath33 refer to the _ space _ coordinates .",
    "this action can be recast , by virtue of a hubbard stratanovich transformation on the associated partition function , as : @xmath34 with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 matsubara frequency ) .",
    "the dissipation kernel @xmath37 here is model dependent and the field @xmath38 is introduced through the transformation .",
    "the maxwellian type of coupling @xmath39 implies that @xmath38 represents a gauge field .",
    "for example , for the caldeira leggett heat bath @xmath40 , which is time - dependent .",
    "the dynamical nature of the gauge field follows from the fact that dissipation is associated with velocity dependent forces .",
    "clearly , this mapping implies two things .",
    "firstly , as the vortices move in the presence of dissipation , they trap a random ab phase @xmath41 , and consequently the arguments of dephasing by random ab phases presented earlier in this section imply a disordered liquid phase for a dissipative system as well . for example , if we consider the case of caldeirra - leggett heat bath above , we see that : when dissipation @xmath42 is much weaker than the quantum zero point motion , gauge field flucutations are weak , the randomness induced by the ab phases is very small and the delocalised vortices are in an entangled state , i.e. a superfluid . however , when dissipation is very strong , gauge field fluctuations are also correspondingly very strong , and the random ab phases can dephase the vortices into a disentangled , i.e. non - superfluid , state .",
    "the liquidity of this state follows from the dynamical nature of the gauge field .",
    "because of this mapping , we shall quite often use gauge field fluctuations and dissipation interchangeably in this paper .",
    "secondly , the above mapping means that a dissipative quantum vortex system ( where vortices have been induced by an external magnetic field ) has a very similar phase diagaram to that of the jja model considered in ref.@xcite , except that now dislocations are present ( see below ) .",
    "there will be an sc phase which consists of dislocation - antidislocation pairs , when quantum fluctuations are weak .",
    "as quantum fluctuations are increased ( by tuning the field , for example ) , the pairs will unbind .",
    "the state this film would enter depends on the strength of dissipation . if dissipation is weak , the vortices will form a superfluid state and the transition is from sc to ins . on the other hand , when the dissipation is strong , the vortices would first enter an uncondensed liquid like state due to dephasing effect by the ab phases . by duality",
    ", this state is a non - sf liquid for the cooper pairs ( see first part of this section ) , and hence , it is fair to call this a bose metal .",
    "the resistance is induced by the free dislocations in this case .",
    "as the field is increased further , quantum zero point motion overcomes dissipation ( or , gf fluctuations ) , the vortices would bose condense and the film will be insulating .",
    "thus , the transition is sc - metal - ins in this case .",
    "we explore some of the consequences of this scenario below .",
    "there are two key points which need to be kept track of while generalising the results for vortices from the zero field case to the field driven case in a dirty film .",
    "( a)in the presence of an external field , vortices enter an sc film in the form of an abrikiosov lattice .",
    "true long range order is not possible in a 2d system at finite temperatures : dislocation - antidislocation pairs are created in the abrikosov lattice . as temperature is increased , these pairs unbind ( the analog of @xmath9 unbinding in the zero field case ) , and ( cooper pair ) superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "( b)in the presence of static disorder , the abrikosov lattice is converted into a glass , called a vortex glass(vg ) .",
    "energy barriers between the various metastable states in this glassy phase are _ finite _ in 2d@xcite . one way to understand",
    "this is that dislocations are point like objects in 2-d , and that disorder screens long - range log interaction between the dislocations .",
    "thus , the energy barriers to create dislocation - antidislocation pairs is finite in 2-d , and the energy barrier to their motion is very small , particularly in the collective pinning regime@xcite , in which we mostly focus on here .",
    "this means that as soon as the dislocation - antidislocation pairs are created , they will hop around and induce finite resistance at any finite temperature @xmath43 , where @xmath44 energy barrier to creation of dislocation pairs .",
    "this would imply that true superconductivity should set in at @xmath1 .",
    "however , at @xmath1 , tunneling processes resulting from quantum fluctuations due to quantum zero point motion , etc .",
    "can in principle be strong and destroy long - range order in the vortex glass phase , which is discussed in this paper .",
    "the presence of a bose metallic phase in a sc film is associated with two phase transitions : one from sc to bm and another from bm to ins .",
    "correspondingly there will be two scaling behaviours for the resistivity even for the field - tuned case , which we discuss below .",
    "_ sc - bm transition _ : the first transition is associated with the unbinding of ( quantum ) dislocation - antidislocation pairs ( or , in a dirty system , when the _ free _ dislocation - antidislocation pairs come into existence@xcite ) . the film enters a metallic state due to strong gauge field fluctuations . finite resistance in the film is induced by free dislocations , which is proportional to the free dislocation density @xmath45@xcite : @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the quantum of resistance and @xmath48 vortex mobility .",
    "@xmath45 scales as @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 sf correlation length that diverges across the sc - bm phase boundary with an exponent @xmath51 : @xmath52 ; @xmath53 is the critical field for sc - bm transition .",
    "hence , on the metallic side , @xmath54 this scaling formula is quite different from traditional quantum sc to non - sc scaling @xmath55 .",
    "observation of this scaling in ref.@xcite provides good evidence that the metallic phase is a bose metal . a comment about the value of @xmath53 :",
    "since energy barriers to metastable states are finite in 2-d in the presence of disorder , one might think that a small amount of quantum fluctuations ( zero point motion and dynamical gauge field fluctuations ) would destabilise the vg order completely , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "but , at very low fields , the vortex system moves into the individual pinning regime from the collective pinning regime , and the energy barriers to the vortex motion due to pinning become very large@xcite .",
    "hence , it is not inconceivable that , in this very low field regime , at @xmath1 , quantum fluctuations and disorder can conspire to produce a pinned vortex state without any free dislocations , and consequently true ( cooper pair ) superconductivity . in other words",
    ", there is a possibility that @xmath57@xcite .",
    "bm - ins transition _ : as the field is increased further , quantum zero point motion of the vortices ( @xmath58 ) increases , and beyond a critical value @xmath59 , the zero point motion overtakes the gauge field fluctuations , the vortices form a sf phase and the film is insulating .",
    "presence of free vortices during this transition motivates a scaling for the resistivity across the bm - ins phase boundary .",
    "so far , this phase boundary has been thought to be a sc - ins transition and the predicted scaling@xcite is @xmath55 .",
    "although this scaling formula works at high temperatures , it fails at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the _ two _ parameter scaling formula which we obtain below for the bm - ins transition , however , scales the data across the entire temperature range , both high and low , when the external field is in the critical regime .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we mentioned that there is a jump in the vortex superfluid density at the bm - ins phase boundary .",
    "naively , this would imply that this is either a first order or a kt type transition .",
    "but , the transition is possibly more subtle than this because it is a phase transition from a ( vortex ) _ superfluid to a gapless nonsuperfluid phase_. in a first order transition , there is no divergent length scale and the length scale is finite through the transition .",
    "but , the bm phase is gapless , i.e. characterised by a diverged length scale .",
    "the kt transition , which is a close precedent to this , on the other hand , is a transition from a superfluid to a _ gapped _ nonsuperfluid state .",
    "also , the situation here is fundamentally different from kt because of the involvement of the gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , we suspect that this transition belongs to a very new universality class . in the absence of the knowledge of what exactly this universality class is , it is hard to write down the scaling formula across this bm - ins transition .",
    "below , we suggest a way to scale the resistance across this metal insulator transition based on phenomenological considerations and leave the rest to future research .    since this is a second order quantum phase transition , there is a diverging correlation length @xmath60 with an exponent @xmath61 at this transition , i.e. @xmath62 , and a frequency scale @xmath63 , which goes to zero with an exponent @xmath64 , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "as the energy dissipated scales as , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 voltage drop , @xmath69 represents the time ) , resistance @xmath70 scales as @xmath71 since the dissipation is due to the vortices , the voltage induced by moving vortices is @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xcite , where @xmath74 is the vortex velocity , @xmath75 is the length over which the vortices move and @xmath76 is the vortex density . to obtain the scaling of @xmath6 , we note that the scaling of @xmath75 is @xmath77 since @xmath78 , the scaling of @xmath74 is @xmath79 we assume that the scaling of @xmath76 is @xmath80 where @xmath32 is an exponent to be determined below .",
    "@xmath76 is _ not _ the total vortex density @xmath81 , but rather the critical fraction of the field induced vortices that participate in the dissipative process . combining all these factors , we find that the scaling of @xmath70 is @xmath82 at any finite temperature , the divergence of @xmath60 is cutoff by temperature @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 this also implies that the scaling function is always a function of @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents the scaling function .",
    "the right hand side comes from the fact that @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , so that @xmath85 is the scaling variable . to obtain @xmath32",
    ", one needs to first note that the resistance saturates to finite values independent of temperature at low temperature ; i.e. in the above eqn , we must have @xmath91 in this limit .",
    "plus , since this low temperature resistance of the film is _ non - critical _ through the metal insulator transition when @xmath92 is tuned through @xmath59 as can be seen from eqn.(11 ) below , we should have @xmath93 thus , the scaling formula for the resistance is : @xmath94^{\\nu ( z + 2 ) } =       f(\\delta / t^{1/\\nu z})\\ ] ] this is essentially a _ two _ parameter scaling formula , which is expected of a bosonic system@xcite . for moge",
    "films@xcite , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and hence , @xmath97 . the corresponding plot of eqn.(5 ) for these films",
    "is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the data collapse with this two parameter scaling formula is quite remarkable .",
    "we think that this points out that there is a true metal - insulator transition at this critical field .",
    "although resistance usually does not receive scaling under normal circumstances , we found at least one precedent to this in the literature , i.e. when a dangerously irrelevant variable is present@xcite .",
    "in this part , we discuss the phenomenology of the metallic state in a dirty sc film , close to the metal - insulator transition , by setting up a quantum  pseudo - temperature \" model@xcite .",
    "this is based on the idea of competition between dissipation and quantum zero point motion of the vortices present near this transition point , presented so far .",
    "the energy barrier to create of dislocation pairs in a disordered vortex lattice is@xcite : @xmath98 at high temperatures , dislocations are created by thermal fluctuations , i.e. dislocation density is @xmath99 , and the resistance induced by these is @xmath100 at low temperatures , quantum fluctuations take over , which we model in terms of a quantum ( pseudo ) temperature @xmath101 : when @xmath101 is small , the vortices being bosons are in a sf state , and when high , it is in a disordered / metallic state ( real temperature remaining constant and small ) . because whether the vortices are in a sf state or non - sf state is determined by the competition between the dissipation @xmath42 and quantum zero point motion , @xmath101 should be a function of these two parameters .",
    "since heating a system increases its entropy , and ( a)enhanced quantum zero point motion ( @xmath102 ) leads to superfluidity in a bose system , and hence , reduced entropy , while ( b)action of dynamical gf fluctuations ( @xmath103 ) increases ( pseudo ) entropy , we expect @xmath101 , for not too small fields , to scale as @xmath104 where @xmath105 are constants @xmath106 .",
    "( it can be any monotonic function of @xmath107 in general . )",
    "currently , we do not know how to obtain @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in what follows",
    ", we shall assume @xmath108 and show that this quantum temperature model captures the general phenomenlogical features of the field - tuned expts in the aforementioned regime very well .",
    "thus , expressed in terms of the quantum temperature model , as the field increases , the quantum temperature of the system decreases and when it falls below a temperature of the _ order _ of kosterlitz thouless temperature @xmath109 ( since vortices here are 2-d bosons ) , the vortices would form a sf , i.e. the film would be insulating . since @xmath110 , the critical field @xmath59 above which the film is insulating is obtained when @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath59 scales as ( using eqn.(6 ) ) : @xmath112 since @xmath42 scales inversely as @xmath113 .",
    "this makes sense physically , since as @xmath42 increases , gauge field fluctuations increase and it is harder to create a sf out of the vortices .",
    "this inverse dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath113 is broadly consistent with the trend observed in the moge films ( see table i in ref.@xcite ) .    when @xmath114 , the vortices are in a non - sf state and the film displays a metallic response . from eqn.(6 ) , the density of quantum dislocations , by analogy with the thermal case , is then @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the resistance of this metal at a finite temperature is given by @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117\\ ] ] this simple additive estimate is a good first hand measure when both thermal activation and quantum tunneling processes are going on simultaneously @xcite .",
    "here we have used @xmath118 , which is true of the bardeen - stephen processes .",
    "this implies that when the real temperature @xmath83 falls below @xmath101 , the vortices enter the quantum regime .",
    "this determines the crossover temperature @xmath119 at which the system moves from the classical to the quantum regime : @xmath120 hence , as the field is increased , the crossover temperature decreases , as seen in the mo - ge experiments@xcite .",
    "this unusual crossover from the classical to quantum regime , which is very unlike that of a single particle system , results from the strong cooperative effects present in the vortex bose system .",
    "thus , from eqn.(8 ) , in the quantum regime , the resistance saturates to @xmath121 where we have used dimensionless expressions for @xmath42 and @xmath92 by rescaling them with @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "@xmath124 is a constant of order unity .",
    "eqn.(10 ) has the same field dependence as that obtained in ref.@xcite if one expands the logarithm about the critical field @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath125 , @xmath126 it should be noted that the metallic resistance is _ non - critical _ across the metal - insulator transition .",
    "thus , despite the simplicity of the quantum temperature model , it captures the basic phenomenology of the experiments very well .    to summarise",
    ", we find several indications here , viz .",
    "( a)occurence of the metallic state as an intermediate phase between sc and ins phases , ( b)scaling behaviour at the sc - metal and metal - ins transitions being in accordance with the bose metal scenario predictions and ( c)the fact that the phenomenology of the metallic state is as would be expected for a bose metal state , to suspect that the metallic state observed in the magnetic field tuned experiments in the sc films is prrobably an adiabatic continuation of the bose metal state presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this final section , we discuss the effective gauge action of the bose metal based on our analysis of the jja model in ref.@xcite .",
    "we obtain certain properties of this metal on the basis of this action , including its low energy excitation spectrum . and then , we revisit the issue of why the bose metallic phase has not been observed in the previous analyses of the jja model or the bose hubbard ( bh ) model .    _ effective action _ : it is clear from the discussion in section ii that a bose metal is a liquid of uncondensed bosons(vortices ) moving in a transverse gauge field .",
    "the effective action of this liquid can be obtained by integrating out the vortices in a one - loop approximation .",
    "this calculation has already been done in appendix e of ref.@xcite : the transverse part of the gauge action can be read off directly from eqn.(e.3 ) there .",
    "thus , the effective action of a bm is : @xmath127 ) = \\sum_{\\omega_{n}}\\int d^{2}q\\left [ \\left(q^{2 } +    1/\\xi_{+}^{2}\\right)a^{0}_{\\omega_{n},q}a^{0}_{-\\omega_{n},-q } + \\left ( \\tilde{a } \\frac{\\mid\\omega_{n}\\mid}{q } + \\tilde{b}q^{2 } \\right )      \\left ( \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } - \\frac{q_{\\alpha}q_{\\beta}}{q^{2}}\\right )      a^{\\alpha}_{\\omega_{n},q}a^{\\beta}_{-\\omega_{n},-q } \\right]\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath129 are finite and scale with free vortex density and may be read off from eqn .",
    "( e.3 ) in @xcite and @xmath130integer@xmath131 are matsubara frequencies .",
    "the spectrum of the longitudinal part of the gauge field follows from the fact that since the vortices and antivortices are free , they screen each other .",
    "since the screening length scales as the density of free vortices @xmath76 and @xmath132 , the above result is obtained .",
    "physically speaking , the above spectrum of the transverse gauge field comes about , beacuse it is dynamically screened@xcite and that there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking in this phase .",
    "thus , the longitudinal modes are gapped but the transverse modes are gapless .",
    "since the gauge field @xmath8 is seen by the vortices , one can use the duality transformation techniques@xcite on this gauge action to calculate the properties of the _ cooper pairs _ ( the original bosons ) in the bose metal phase . the superfluid density and the compressiblity of the charges , i.e. cooper pairs , are@xcite : @xmath133 here",
    "the superscript @xmath134 denotes charges and we have used @xmath135 from eqn.(e.3 ) , where @xmath136 is the renormalised plasmon velocity .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that a bose metal is a non - superfluid compressible liquid .",
    "the specific heat of the bm can be calculated from eqn.(12 ) .",
    "this has already been done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the gapless transverse modes make the most important contribution to the specific heat : the low temperature specific heat of the bm goes as @xmath137 .",
    "this @xmath138 power law specific heat , in turn , directly implies that the low energy excitation spectrum of the original cooper pair system in this liquid state goes as : @xmath139 this unconventional excitation spectrum results from the strong correlation effects present in the system and is consistent with the fact that landau critical velocity should be zero in a nonsuperfluid bose system .",
    "the density of states is correspondingly divergent : @xmath140 .",
    "obviously , the bm state _ can not _ be continued to a fermi liquid or mapped onto a set of free particles .",
    "we shall argue below that this liquid is gapless beacuse it is an @xmath2 spin liquid , rather than an @xmath141 spin liquid .    in ref.@xcite , we pointed out that the phase ( @xmath142 ) and charge fluctuation operators ( @xmath143 ) entering the jja model are the generators of @xmath2 , the euclidean group in two dimensions ; @xmath2 being a group contraction of @xmath144 . in this sense , the jja model is an @xmath2  spin \" model and the bm phase being the disordered phase of this model should be regarded as an @xmath2 spin liquid .",
    "an extremely important point is that , whereas an @xmath141 spin liquid is usually gapped , an @xmath2 spin liquid is _ necessarily gapless_. this follows from the distinction that whereas an @xmath141 spin model maps onto bosons in a _ constant _ magnetic field@xcite , an @xmath2 spin model maps onto bosons in a _ fluctuating _ magnetic field . because of the constant magnetic field , the @xmath141 spin liquid maps onto a quantum hall liquid@xcite .",
    "this means that the effective gauge action has a chern simmons term and the excitations are correspondingly gapped . on the other hand , the effective gauge action of the @xmath2 spin liquid is of maxwellian type , i.e. _ without _ any chern simmons term : @xmath145 ) = \\int d\\omega d^{2}q f(\\omega , q)a^{\\alpha } _",
    "{          \\omega , q}a^{\\alpha}_{-\\omega ,- q}\\ ] ] now ,",
    "if the excitation spectrum is gapped , i.e. @xmath146 constant , then this means that there is spontaneous symmetry breaking and the z - component of the @xmath2 spins are ordered , i.e. the system is charge - ordered@xcite .",
    "hence , the @xmath2 spin liquid is necessarily gapless . for the jja model",
    "we have been discussing so far , this feature can be seen directly by focussing on the transverse part of the gauge action in eqn.(12 ) .",
    "it is hard to rule out the possibility of excitations with fractional quantum numbers@xcite in this liquid .",
    "however , since there is no explicit time reversal symmetry breaking in the effective action , we think that such excitations would always exist in pairs being held together strongly by gauge - like forces .",
    "_ jja model : what s missing ?",
    "_ in this last part of the paper , we revisit the issue of why the bose metallic phase has not been observed in the previous analyses of the jja model or the bose hubbard ( bh ) model .",
    "the key issue which distinguishes our analysis from the others is that our calculation has been done in the limit when the average bosonic filling per site is very large . in this limit , the bh model maps onto a jja model .",
    "a lot of current calculations on the jja model are strongly influenced by the results available for the bh model at low fillings .",
    "however , as we stressed in our previous paper , the algebraic properties of the bh model in these two limits are very different : in the limit of low fillings , the model is very close to that of the @xmath141 spin model . on the other hand , in the limit of large fillings ,",
    "it is close to that of the @xmath2 spin model .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that @xmath141 and the @xmath2 algebras are actually connected by a _ singular _",
    "transformation@xcite so that the results obtained in one limit can not be continued adiabatically to those in the other limit , i.e. without crossing a phase boundary .",
    "this also lends extra support to our argument above that the properties of the spin liquids supported by the two spin models are distinctly different .",
    "hence , it is very important to maintain this distinction between @xmath141 and @xmath2 while performing calculations on the jja model .",
    "the limit of large fillings is good for the sc films , whereas low filling limit is good for helium films@xcite .    as a second point ,",
    "a lot of the calculations on jja model have been done for the case when an external gate voltage @xmath147 is present .",
    "we have worked on the case @xmath148 .",
    "this situation is close to that of the real granular sc films . and ,",
    "finally , our calculations have been done in the presence of nearest neighbour interaction @xmath149 .",
    "the presence of @xmath149 brings about non - trivial effects in the jja model , a quite well explored instance of which is the onset of supersolidity when rescaled gate voltage is close to half integer .",
    "more details on these differences may be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are two previous calculations on the jja model for @xmath148 and @xmath150 : mean field calculations and numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "the reasons for non - observation of the bm phase in these are as follows : ( a)_mean field _ : a bm phase benefits partly both from the kinetic energy and the potential energy terms .",
    "but , in a mean field calculation , as soon as superfluidity is destroyed , the kinetic energy term is completely suppressed .",
    "( b)_numerical simulations _ :",
    "the problem with this calculation is that the authors investigated only the superfluid phase in the @xmath151 plane at @xmath148 .",
    "only superfluid density and structure factor @xmath152 were measured here , which do not distinguish between a mott insulator phase and a bm phase : both of these quantities are zero in these states .",
    "more simulations addressing this issue might be helpful to crosscheck the existence of the bm phase and its properties .",
    "we would like to thank stuart trugman , steve kivelson and eugene demler for helpful discussions and nadya mason for providing us with the moge data .",
    "partial support from the department of energy through the complex materials program at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory is appreciated .",
    "here we enlist the actions for bosons and fermions in the world line picture , which might help the reader in understanding the world line picture discussion of the gauge field fluctuations in section ii .",
    "first , consider a system of @xmath153 interacting bosons in the world line picture , _ without _ any gauge field .",
    "partition function of this system is @xmath154 \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the permutation of the particles@xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "the world lines get entangled because of quantum zero point motion effects , which implies a finite superfluid density for the bosons@xcite .",
    "now consider an equivalent system of fermions@xcite . here",
    ", the partition function is @xmath155 \\right)\\ ] ] the extra phase factor coming from the anticommutativity of the fermions . because of this phase factor",
    ", it is readily clear that entangled configurations enter with random signs and cause cancellation of several terms .",
    "thus , since the entangled configurations enter the partition function with low weight , this means that these configurations are high energy configurations and disentanglement is favoured for a fermionic system . and ,",
    "hence the ground state of a fermi system is a non - superfluid .",
