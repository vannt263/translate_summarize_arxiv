    "+ in this work , we generalise the results presented in @xcite to describe typical as well as atypical fluctuations in the asymptotic limit of very large matrices .",
    "we derive , in turn , a unifying way to obtain large deviations to the left and to the right of the typical value of an extreme eigenvalue . in the past , large deviations to the left and to the right of , for instance , the largest eigenvalue had to be analysed separately , using the coulomb fluid picture to obtain the left rate function ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and other methodologies ( e.g. energetic balance arguments @xcite , formal mathematical approaches @xcite , other rather elaborate mathematical approaches as loop theory ) to describe the deviations to the right . surprisingly ,",
    "as we will illustrate , these two statistics for bulk and extreme eigenvalues are captured by a single rate function @xmath0 depending on two parameters .",
    "+ part of these results already appeared in @xcite in the context of full order statistics of a system of one - dimensional spinless fermions trapped on a external harmonic potential . here",
    "we present all details of the mathematical derivations and compare our findings thoroughly with monte carlo simulations .",
    "+ this paper is organised as follows : in sect [ sec : md ] we introduce the various definitions that will be used throughout the paper and we also point out the connection of the full order statistics with the statistics of the shifted index number ; in sect [ sec : cfa ] we describe the mathematical derivations using the coulomb fluid picture , exposing as well the various ways to evaluate the free energy associated to the coulomb fluid , how to derive exact expressions of the constrained spectral density resulting from fixing a fraction of eigenvalues to the left of @xmath2 , and how to obtain an exact expression of the rate function using complete and incomplete elliptic integrals ; in sect .",
