    "although the standard model ( sm ) is spectacularly successful in accommodating experimental data over a wide range of energies , it is widely believed to be an effective theory that is applicable below an energy scale @xmath2  tev .",
    "new degrees of freedom ( or at least evidence of structure via form factors ) are expected to manifest themselves in experiments designed to probe energies above this scale .",
    "this belief stems from the instability of the parameters of the elementary scalar field sector to radiative corrections .",
    "this instability , in turn , may be interpreted as an extreme sensitivity of weak scale physics to parameters that describe physics at much higher energy scales .",
    "this is referred to as the fine - tuning problem of the sm .",
    "we stress that this is not a logical problem in that the sm provides an internally consistent predictive framework , but more a problem of what we expect of a fundamental theory ( which the sm is not ) .",
    "a conceptually distinct issue refers to the introduction of small dimensionless parameters , be they dimensionless couplings or small ratios of mass scales , into a theory .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that a dimensionless parameter p may be much smaller than unity only if the replacement @xmath3 increases the symmetry of the theory .",
    "theories that satisfy this requirement are technically referred to as natural .",
    "a small yukawa coupling in grand unified theories ( guts ) is technically natural ( because setting it to zero leads to a new chiral symmetry ) , but the introduction of the tiny ratio of the electroweak higgs boson mass parameter to the grand unification scale is not .",
    "likewise , within the framework of the simplest supersymmetric guts the choice @xmath4 is technically unnatural .",
    "this is the well - known `` @xmath5 problem '' .",
    "various dynamical mechanisms have been suggested to explain why @xmath5 is of the same size as the susy breaking scale @xcite .    while supersymmetry , by itself",
    ", does not address the naturalness question , it has received a lot of attention in the last two decades because it leads to an elegant solution to the fine - tuning problem of the first paragraph , provided that the susy breaking scale is comparable to the weak scale@xcite .",
    "supersymmetry thus preserves the hierarchy between the weak and gut ( or planck ) scales even in the presence of radiative corrections . but",
    "why this hierarchy exists at all requires an independent dynamical explanation .",
    "the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino data of the super - kamiokande collaboration@xcite as neutrino oscillations has led to a renewed interest in @xmath6 guts since neutrinos necessarily acquire masses within this framework .",
    "susy models based on @xmath6 require that the parameter @xmath0 is large@xcite .",
    "it has been argued , however , that models with large @xmath0 are technically unnatural@xcite .",
    "it is an evaluation of this claim that forms the subject of this note .",
    "we begin by examining the part of the scalar potential relevant for spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . at tree - level",
    ", this takes the form , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the minimization conditions can readily be derived from this potential and take the well known form , @xmath9 it follows from ( [ minimizationb1 ] ) that if @xmath10 , the parameter @xmath11 has a much smaller magnitude than the other parameters in the scalar potential .",
    "thus the model is technically unnatural unless the limit @xmath12 ( equivalently , @xmath13 ) increases the symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "indeed @xmath14 can naturally be made small by an approximate r symmetry , while @xmath5 could be small because of an approximate peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry , which is taken to commute with supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , since either of these symmetries requires a chargino with a mass below its experimental lower limit , an enlargement of the higgs sector was proposed to make the large @xmath0 scenario natural@xcite .",
    "this simple argument is based on an analysis of the vacuum of the tree - level potential . in the next section",
    ", we show that ( unlike at tree level ) if we take into account radiative corrections to the potential , the value of @xmath11 does not vanish even if @xmath15 .",
    "if this radiatively corrected value of @xmath11 ( though loop suppressed ) is not much smaller than other soft susy breaking parameters ( this could be because of hierarchies of @xmath16 in their values , which is certainly allowed in a generic susy model ) , the @xmath17 limit is not unnatural in the sense of ref.@xcite , as implied by the tree - level analysis .",
    "this is our main point .",
    "is large @xcite .",
    "we believe that this conclusion based on the tree level analysis of the vacuum state , for which it follows from eq .",
    "( [ minimizationb1 ] ) that @xmath18 as @xmath17 .",
    "our point is that the same conclusion does not follow once radiative corrections are included . ] in section  iii , we exhibit technically natural scenarios with very large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the upper bound on @xmath0 comes from the requirement that yukawa couplings remain perturbative up to a scale @xmath19 , and quantify the relation between the maximum value of @xmath20 and this scale .",
    "we conclude in the last section with a discussion of our analysis .",
    "radiative corrections cause the ground state of a quantum theory to differ from the ground state of the corresponding classical theory . these radiative corrections",
    "are automatically included when the vacuum state is computed by minimizing the effective potential @xmath21 of the quantum theory , where the the one loop radiative correction to the potential , renormalized at the scale @xmath22 , is given by @xmath23 here the sum is taken over independent real boson or majorana fermion fields in the loop ( complex boson fields and dirac fermions , therefore , contribute twice as much ) , @xmath24 are the field dependent squared masses of the particles in the loops , @xmath25 is their spin , and the factor @xmath26 for coloured ( uncoloured ) particles .    for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ,",
    "the relevant part of @xmath27 is given by ( [ eq : potesc ] ) .",
    "gauge invariance dictates that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functions of the field combinations , @xmath29 so that @xmath30 it is then easy to see that the effect of including the one loop correction to the potential is equivalent to the replacements , @xmath31 in the tree level minimization conditions ( [ minimizationb1 ] ) and ( [ minimizationb2 ] ) , where , @xmath32 the radiatively corrected minimization conditions are thus given by , @xmath33 in the @xmath34 limit we see that @xmath35 which , though suppressed by a loop factor , _ does not vanish_. indeed as long as @xmath36 is sizeable , models with large @xmath0 do not suffer from the naturalness problem .",
    "this is our main observation .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath28 arises from the third generation yukawa interactions . to illustrate solutions with very large values of @xmath0",
    ", we will ignore electroweak gauge coupling corrections to the effective potential which are known to be small , and whose inclusion will not significantly affect our results . in this case , @xmath36 that enters the determination of @xmath11 is given by , @xmath37 with @xmath38 here , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the yukawa coupling of fermion @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the sfermion mass eigenstates , the colour factor @xmath43 when @xmath41 is a quark ( lepton ) , and the function @xmath44 that appears in ( [ eq : sigudsqlp ] ) is given by , @xmath45 in a generic susy model , it is entirely possible that the weak scale @xmath46-parameters and @xmath47 are a few times larger than the soft susy breaking masses ; in this case , the factor @xmath48 would largely compensate for the loop suppression , and @xmath36 ( and hence , @xmath11 ) would be comparable to other soft susy breaking masses . in any case ,",
    "fine - tuning of parameters at the level of @xmath49 , that is suggested by the tree - level analysis , is not needed .",
    "although we have argued that very large @xmath0 solutions are not necessarily unnatural within the mssm framework , it still remains to be shown that those solutions can be phenomenologically viable and theoretically interesting . by this , we mean that we look for large @xmath0 solutions with third generation matter fermion masses given by their experimental values , and with the corresponding yukawa couplings in the perturbative range .    in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the experimental values for the third generation fermion masses determine the corresponding yukawa couplings at @xmath50 , but only if we know the sparticle mass spectrum .",
    "this is because supersymmetric particle loops affect the fermion masses through threshold corrections @xcite .",
    "analytical expressions for the one loop susy threshold corrections were given in the literature @xcite . to leave our approach as model - independent as possible , we parametrize our ignorance of the supersymmetric threshold corrections to third generation fermion masses through a set of coefficients , @xmath51 , which appear in the relations between matter fermion masses and the corresponding yukawa couplings : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "here , @xmath54 is the top quark pole mass while @xmath55 and @xmath56 are running bottom quark and tau lepton masses at the scale @xmath22 in the @xmath57 scheme .",
    "the coefficient @xmath58 is the usual qcd correction relating the pole and running top masses .",
    "this does not appear in the formula for @xmath59 since for this we use the running mass @xmath60  gev as the experimental input @xcite .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 in the expressions for bottom and tau yukawa couplings captures the fact that , for large @xmath0 , the susy corrections to @xmath61 and @xmath62 scale with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as we have already noted , the susy threshold corrections depend on the unknown sparticle spectrum . in the following ,",
    "we implement these by adopting reasonable values of the coefficients @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 as given in typical models with sparticles in the range of 100 - 1000  gev .",
    "specifically , @xmath63 is positive , and increases logarithmically with @xmath66 .",
    "our results are insensitive to its precise value which we take to be 0.04 , corresponding to @xmath66 somewhat larger than 1 tev .",
    "the threshold corrections for the down type fermions depend on @xmath5 , and so can have either sign .",
    "we take @xmath67 which gives a susy threshold of @xmath68 for @xmath69 , typical of the msugra framework with tev scale parameters . for @xmath65 , we take @xmath70 which correspond to @xmath71 for @xmath69 as a typical value , and @xmath72 as a somewhat extreme case .    if all other things are the same , the bottom yukawa coupling is clearly larger if @xmath73 .",
    "thus the largest values of @xmath0 for which @xmath59 remains in the perturbative range occur when @xmath74 ( assuming @xmath59 is positive ) .",
    "likewise , we would expect that the requirement that @xmath75 lie in the perturbative range would allow larger values of @xmath0 when @xmath76 ; however , if @xmath65 is negative , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 decreases as @xmath0 increases beyond this value . it is easy to check that this branch of the @xmath80 curve asymptotically approaches the @xmath81 curve , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yuksp ] where we show the value of @xmath82 evaluated at @xmath50 versus @xmath0 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "naively , one might conclude that `` viable '' solutions to the mssm are possible for @xmath0 values up to 800 .",
    "this is , however , not the case since a yukawa coupling close to the `` perturbative limit '' ( aside from the fact that this might be phenomenologically unacceptable ) would blow up at a scale @xmath19 not far above @xmath85 , and we would lose our main motivation for _ weak scale _ supersymmetry .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry is well - motivated only if the scale @xmath19 where _ any _ coupling becomes non - perturbative is sufficiently separated from @xmath85 .",
    "we stress that the electroweak scale is destabilized even if @xmath19 is much smaller than @xmath86 or @xmath87 : it is both model - dependent and a matter of judgement just how large a @xmath19 is acceptable in any extension of the sm without supersymmetry to stabilize the electroweak scale .",
    "since a discussion of this would take us away from our main point , we show the value of @xmath19 as a function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : natural ] .",
    "we have again fixed @xmath88 and illustrate our result for @xmath89 ( dotted green curve , labelled a ) , @xmath90 ( dashed - dotted pink line , labelled b ) , @xmath91 ( dashed blue line , labelled c ) and @xmath92 ( solid red line , labelled d ) .",
    "in all these cases , it is the coupling @xmath93 that exceeds unity at @xmath94 , with the other yukawa couplings remaining perturbative .",
    "this figure , which updates previous work by haber and zwirner @xcite , includes two - loop yukawa coupling rges and models the effect of susy threshold corrections .",
    "we see that for @xmath19 close to @xmath87 , the maximum value of @xmath0 is never much above what one obtains within the msugra framework .",
    "we stress though that the value of this maximum is dictated by the measured fermion masses and _ not by the naturalness considerations_. to emphasize this , we show the corresponding curve ( dashed black line , labelled e ) for @xmath95 but with tau lepton and bottom quark masses fixed at half their experimental values .",
    "in such a universe , it is easily possible to find natural models with @xmath0 larger than 200 , and couplings in the perturbative range all the way up to @xmath96 .",
    "returning to the case of realistic masses , we see from the figure that ( depending on the value of susy thresholds ) models with @xmath0 as large as 150 may be natural if the new physics scale is smaller than @xmath97  gev , and we use susy to stabilize the electroweak scale relative to this intermediate scale .    it is well known that susy phenomenology of large @xmath0 models differs considerably @xcite from that of models with low or moderate values of @xmath0 . what is less clear ( because in the well - studied models , @xmath98 ) is whether the phenomenology is altered as @xmath0 is changed from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "as we have already explained , @xmath101 can only be accommodated if @xmath19 is relatively low .",
    "this led us to examine the gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) framework with a low messenger scale . within the minimal version of this model , the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism breaks down , leading to @xmath102 ( for small @xmath103 values , @xmath104 ) , if @xmath0 is too large .",
    "is very large , the bottom and top yukawa couplings are similar , so that @xmath105 and @xmath106 start from a common value and roughly evolve together .",
    "this then causes @xmath107 ( valid for large values of @xmath0 ) to turn negative . ] to obtain larger values of @xmath0 , we introduced additional contributions @xmath108 to the soft susy breaking higgs boson masses , since these can facilitate radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we attribute their origin to additional interactions needed to generate the @xmath5 and @xmath11 parameters within this framework  @xcite .    .selected sparticle masses for two non  minimal gmsb scenario with @xmath109  tev , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we take @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for the corresponding minimal model ,",

    "the sfermions of the first two generations and the charginos and neutralinos have the same masses to within about a percent in the two cases .",
    "third generation squark masses differ by a fraction of a percent for @xmath119-squarks to about 10% for @xmath120 .",

    "tevatron experiments may be able to probe the @xmath124 scenario in the table via the decay @xmath125 whose branching fraction is usually very small in gmsb models @xcite .",

    "the message of this illustrative example is that changing @xmath0 from a large to a very large value has experimentally interesting implications .",
    "we have pointed out that the usual arguments @xcite that suggest that supersymmetric extensions of the sm are unnatural for large values of the parameter @xmath0 are inapplicable when 1-loop corrections to the effective potential are included : as can be seen from ( [ largetanmub ] ) , the soft mass parameter @xmath131 does not vanish as @xmath132 , and the question of checking whether there is an increased symmetry when @xmath133 becomes moot . in a _",

    "we stress though that there may be a different fine - tuning required in specific models if @xmath0 is very large . for instance , in the msugra framework , characterized by the soft breaking parameters , @xmath134 and @xmath135 at the high scale , the parameter @xmath11 at the weak scale will be of loop - suppressed magnitude only if the high scale parameters are all of comparable size , but related in a specific manner . from the perspective of a low energy theorist who does not have an understanding of the susy breaking mechanism , this appears to require an unexplained adjustment of the underlying parameters .. ] but , perhaps , it is better to view this as a necessary property of the physics underlying supersymmetry breaking ; _",
    "i.e. _ the soft parameters that emerge from the theory of supersymmetry breaking must be related so that @xmath11 is small at the weak scale .",
    "however , this issue seems to be separate from the naturalness question that we have focussed upon .    in summary",
