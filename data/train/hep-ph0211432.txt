    "the @xmath1 meson is the ground state of @xmath3 system which in many respects is an intermediate between charmonium and bottonium systems .",
    "however because the @xmath1 mesons carry flavour , they provide a window for studying the heavy - quark dynamics that is very different from those provided by @xmath4- and @xmath5-quarkonia .    the first observation of approximately 20 @xmath1 events in the @xmath6 decay mode by the cdf collaboration @xcite demonstrates the possibility of the experimental study of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the @xmath3 states have rich spectroscopy of the orbital and angular - momentum exitations . below the threshold of the decay into @xmath7 pair",
    ", one can expect 16 extremely narrow states which cascadely decay into the ground pseudoscalar state with mass of about 6.3 gev by radiating photons and pion pairs .",
    "the annihilation decays can occure due to weak interactions only and , hence , are suppressed for excited levels .",
    "the production mechanism for @xmath3 system differs in an essential way from that for @xmath8 system , because two heavy quark - antiquark pairs must be created in a collision .",
    "while the @xmath8 pair can be created in the parton processes @xmath9 at the order of @xmath10 , the lowest order mechanism for the creating of @xmath3 system is at least of @xmath11 : @xmath12 , and gluon - gluon contribution dominates at tevatron and lhc energies . at lhc with the luminosity of about @xmath13 @xmath14 one could expect around @xmath15 @xmath1 events per year . at tevatron energy",
    "the expected yield should be at least one order smaller .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath1 mesons are attractive due to presence of both channels : a ) the @xmath16-quark decay with the @xmath17 quark as a spectator , and b ) the @xmath17-constituent decay with @xmath16 as a spectator .",
    "in addition the weak annihilation contribution into decay channels is quite visible ( around 10% ) .",
    "the dominant contribution into @xmath1 life - time ( @xmath18 ps ) comes from the @xmath17-quark decays ( @xmath19 70% ) while the @xmath16-quark decays and weak annihilation add about 20%  and 10%  respectively .    the accurate measurement of the @xmath1 life - time can provide us with the information on both the masses of charm and beauty quarks and the normalization point of non - leptonic weak lagrangian in the @xmath1 decays .",
    "the experimental study of the semileptonic decays and the extraction of the decay form - factors can test the spin symmetry derived in nrqcd and hqet approaches .",
    "the measurement of the branching fractions for semileptonic and hadronic modes can provide an information about the parameters of weak lagrangian and hadronic matrix elements determined by the non - perturbative effects due to quark confinement .",
    "the most accurate estimates of @xmath21 masses @xcite can be obtained in the framework of nonrelativistic potential models based on the nrqcd expansion over both @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of evaluation is about 30 mev .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the potential models @xcite were justified for the well measured masses of charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "so , the potentials with various global behaviour , i.e. with the different @xmath24 and @xmath25 asymptotics , have the same form in the range of mean distances between the quarks in the heavy quarkonia at @xmath26 fm @xcite . the observed regularity in the distances between the excitation levels are approximately flavor - independent .",
    "the latter is exact for the logarithmic potential ( the feynman  hell - mann theorem ) , where the average kinetic energy of quarks @xmath27 is a constant value independent of the excitation numbers ( the virial theorem ) @xcite .",
    "a slow dependence of the level distances on the reduced mass can be taken into account by the use of the martin potential ( power law : @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) @xcite , wherein the predictions are in agreement with the qcd - motivated buchm \" uller - tye potential with the account for the two - loop evolution of the coupling constant at short distances @xcite .",
    "so , one gets the picture of @xmath21 levels which is very close to the texture of charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "the difference is the jj - binding instead of the ls one .",
    "the spin - dependent perturbation of the potential includes the contribution of the effective one - gluon exchange ( the vector part ) as well as the scalar confining term @xcite .",
    "@xmath30    the model - dependent value of effective @xmath31 @xcite can be extracted from the data on the splitting in the charmonium @xmath32 we take into account the renormalization - group dependence of @xmath31 at the one - loop accuracy by means of introduction of the quarkonium scale @xcite @xmath33 the estimated difference between the masses of basic pseudoscalar state and its vector excitation @xcite is equal to @xmath34 the mass of the ground state @xcite equals @xmath35 which is in agreement with the cdf measurements @xmath36 gev @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present here the current status of the @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "we have found that the various approaches : ope , potential models and qcd sum rules , result in the close estimates , while the sr as explored for the various heavy quark systems , lead to a smaller uncertainty due to quite an accurate knowledge of the heavy quark masses .",
    "so , summarizing , we expect that the dominant contribution to the @xmath1 lifetime is given by the charmed quark decays ( @xmath37 ) , while the @xmath16-quark decays and the weak annihilation add about 20% and 10% , respectively .",
    "the coulomb - like @xmath38-corrections play an essential role in the determination of exclusive form factors in the qcd sr .",
    "the form factors obey the relations dictated by the spin symmetry of nrqcd and hqet with quite a good accuracy expected .",
    "the predictions of qcd sum rules for the exclusive decays of @xmath1 are summarized in table [ common ] at the fixed values of factors @xmath39 and lifetime .",
    "in addition to the decay channels with the heavy charmonium @xmath40 well detectable through its leptonic mode , one could expect a significant information on the dynamics of @xmath1 decays from the channels with single heavy mesons , if an experimental efficiency allows one to extract a signal from the cascade decays . an interesting opportunity is presented by the relations for the ratios in ( [ factk ] ) , which can shed light to characteristics of the non - leptonic decays in the explicit form .",
    "we have found that the @xmath41 decay to the doubly charmed states gives @xmath42 \\approx 3.26\\%,\\ ] ] so that in the absolute value of width it can be compared with the estimate of spectator decay @xcite , @xmath43\\right|_{\\mbox{\\sc sr } } & \\approx & 48\\cdot 10^{-15}\\,\\mbox{gev},\\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] \\left.\\gamma[b_c^+\\to \\bar c c\\,c\\bar s]\\right|_{\\rm spect . } & \\approx & 90\\cdot 10^{-15}\\,\\mbox{gev } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we find the suppression factor of about @xmath44 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the estimate in ope @xcite , where a strong dependence of negative term caused by the pauli interference on the normalization scale of non - leptonic weak lagrangian was emphasized , so that at large scales one gets approximately the same suppression factor of @xmath44 , too .    to the moment we certainly state that the accurate direct measurement of @xmath1 lifetime can provide us with the information on both the masses of charmed and beauty quarks and the normalization point of non - leptonic weak lagrangian in the @xmath1 decays ( the @xmath45 and @xmath46 factors ) .",
    "the experimental study of semileptonic decays and the extraction of ratios for the form factors can test the spin symmetry derived in the nrqcd and hqet approaches and decrease the theoretical uncertainties in the corresponding theoretical evaluation of quark parameters , as well as the hadronic matrix elements , determined by the nonperturbative effects caused by the quark confinement .",
    "the measurement of branching fractions for the semileptonic and non - leptonic modes and their ratios can give information on the values of factorization parameters , which depend again on the normalization of non - leptonic weak lagrangian .",
    "the charmed quark counting in the @xmath1 decays is related to the overall contribution of @xmath16 quark decays , as well as with the suppression of @xmath47 transition because of the destructive pauli interference , which value depends on the nonperturbative parameters ( roughly estimated , the leptonic constant ) and non - leptonic weak lagrangian .",
    "thus , the progress in measuring the @xmath1 lifetime and decays could improve the theoretical understanding of what really happens in the heavy quark decays at all .",
    "we point also to the papers , wherein some aspects of @xmath1 decays and spectroscopy were studied : non - leptonic decays in @xcite , polarization effects in the radiative leptonic decays @xcite , relativistic effects @xcite , spectroscopy in the systematic approach of potential nonrelativistic qcd in @xcite , nonperturbative effects in the semileptonic decays @xcite , exclusive and inclusive decays of @xmath1 states into the lepton pair and hadrons @xcite , rare decays in @xcite , the spectroscopy and radiative decays in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 system is a heavy quarkonium , i.e. it contains two heavy quarks .",
    "this determines the general features for the @xmath1 meson production in various interactions :    \\1 .",
    "perturbative calculations for the hard associative production of two heavy pairs of @xmath49 and @xmath50 and    \\2 .",
    "a soft nonperturbative binding of nonrelativistic quarks in the color - singlet state can be described in the framework of potential models .",
    "the two above conditions result in the suppression of the @xmath1 yield of the order of @xmath51 with respect to beauty hadrons .",
    "as was mentioned above , the consideration of mechanisms for the hadronic production of different spin @xmath1-states is based on the factorization of hard parton production of heavy quarks @xmath52 and soft coupling of @xmath21 bound state @xcite . in the first stage of description",
    ", the hard subprocess can be reliably calculated in the framework of qcd perturbation theory , while in the second stage the quark binding in the heavy quarkonium can be described in the nonrelativistic potential model assigned to the @xmath21-pair rest system .",
    "the latter means that one performs the integration of the final quark state over the quarkonium wave function in the momentum space .",
    "since the relative quark velocity inside the meson is close to zero , the perturbative matrix element can be expanded in series over the relative quark momentum , which is low in comparison with the quark masses determining the scale of virtualities and energies in the matrix element . in the leading approximation one",
    "considers only the first nonzero term of such expansion , so that for the @xmath53-wave states the matrix element of the parton subprocess for the @xmath1 production is expressed through the perturbative matrix element for the production of four heavy quarks @xmath54 with the corresponding projection to the vector or pseudoscalar spin state of @xmath21-system , which is the color singlet , and through the factor of radial wave function at the origin , @xmath55 , for the given quarkonium .",
    "the perturbative matrix element is calculated for the @xmath21 state , where the quarks move with the same velocity , i.e. one neglects the relative motion of @xmath41 and @xmath17 .    for the @xmath56-wave states ,",
    "the potential model gives the factor in the form of first derivative of the radial wave function at the origin , @xmath57 . in the perturbative part",
    ", one has to calculate the first derivative of the matrix element over the relative quark momentum at the point , where the velocities of quarks , entering the quarkonium , equal each to other .",
    "thus , in addition to the heavy quark masses , the values of @xmath55 , @xmath57 and @xmath31 are the parameters of calculation for the partonic production of @xmath1 meson . in calculations we use the wave function parameters equal to the values shown in table x and @xmath58 gev@xmath59 . the value of @xmath60 can be related with the leptonic constant , @xmath61 , so that we have @xmath62    in the approximation of the weak quark binding inside the meson one has @xmath63 , so that the performable phase space in calculations is close to physical one at the choices of @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev for the @xmath66-state , @xmath67 gev , @xmath68 gev for the @xmath69-state , @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 gev for the @xmath72-state .",
    "at large transverse momenta of the @xmath1 meson , @xmath73 , the production mechanism enters the regime of @xmath41-quark fragmentation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , so that the scale determining the qcd coupling constant in hard @xmath50 production is given by @xmath74 , and in the hard fragmentation production of the additional pair of heavy quarks @xmath49 we get @xmath75 .",
    "this scale choice is caused by the high order corrections of perturbation theory to the hard gluon propagators , where the summing of logarithms over the virtualities leads to the pointed @xmath76 values .",
    "therefore , the normalization of matrix element is determined by the value of @xmath77 . in calculations we use the single combined value of @xmath78 .",
    "the parton subprocess of gluon - gluon fusion @xmath79 dominates in the hadron - hadron production of @xmath1 mesons . in the leading approximation of qcd perturbation theory it requires the calculation of 36 diagrams in the fourth order over the @xmath31 coupling constant .    by the general theorem on factorization , it is clear that at high transverse momenta the fragmentation of the heavier quark @xmath80 must dominate .",
    "it is described by the factorized formula @xmath81 where @xmath76 is the factorization scale , @xmath82 is the cross - section for the gluon - gluon production of quarks @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the fragmentation function .",
    "the calculation for the complete set of diagrams of the @xmath85-contribution @xcite allows one to determine a value of the transverse momentum @xmath86 , which is the low boundary of the region where the subprocess of gluon - gluon @xmath1-meson production enters the regime of factorization for the hard production of @xmath87-pair and the subsequent fragmentation of @xmath41-quark into the bound @xmath21-state , as it follows from the theorem on the factorization of the hard processes in the perturbative qcd .",
    "@xmath88 , nb / gev +    the @xmath86 value turns out to be much greater than the @xmath89 mass , so that the dominant contribution into the total cross - section of gluon - gluon @xmath1-production is given by the diagrams of nonfragmentational type , i.e. by the recombination of heavy quarks .",
    "furthermore , the convolution of the parton cross - section with the gluon distributions inside the initial hadrons leads to the suppression of contributions at large transverse momenta , as well as the subprocesses with large energy in the system of parton mass centre , so that the main contribution into the total cross - section of hadronic @xmath1-production is given by the region of energies less or comparable to the @xmath1-meson mass , where the fragmentation model can not be applied by its construction .",
    "therefore , one must perform the calculations with the account for all contributions in the given order under consideration in the region near the threshold .",
    "the large numeric value of @xmath90 means that the majority of events of the hadronic @xmath91-production does not certainly allow the description in the framework of the fragmentation model .",
    "this conclusion looks more evident , if one considers the @xmath1-meson spectrum over the energy .",
    "the basic part of events for the gluon - gluon production of @xmath1 is accumulated in the region of low @xmath92 close to 0 , where the recombination dominates .",
    "one can draw the conclusion on the essential destructive interference in the region of @xmath92 close to 1 and @xmath93 , for the pseudoscalar state .",
    "we have considered in detail the contributions of each diagram in the region of @xmath94 . in",
    "the covariant feynman gauge the diagrams of the gluon - gluon production of @xmath83 with the subsequent @xmath95 fragmentation dominate , as well as the diagrams when the @xmath96 pair is produced in the region of the initial gluon splitting .",
    "however , the contribution of the latter diagrams leads to the destructive interference with the fragmentation amplitude , and this results in the `` reduction '' of the production cross - section in the region of @xmath92 close to 1 . in the axial gauge with the vector @xmath97",
    "this effect of the interference still manifests itself brighter , since the diagrams like the splitting of gluons dominate by several orders of magnitude over the fragmentation , but the destructive interference results in the cancellation of such extremely large contributions .",
    "this interference is caused by the nonabelian nature of qcd , i.e. , by the presence of the gluon self - action vertices .",
    "the using of cteq5l parameterization for the structure functions of nucleon @xcite leads to the total hadronic cross - sections for the @xmath1 mesons of about 0.8 @xmath76b that accepts contributions from : @xmath98    after the summing over the different spin states , the total cross - sections for the production of @xmath56-wave levels is equal to 7% of the @xmath53-state cross - section .    at lhc with the luminosity @xmath99 @xmath100s@xmath101 and @xmath102 tev one could expect @xmath103 events per year .",
    "nevertheless , the p - wave states could be of a particular interest due to their radiative decays with relatively energetic photons ( around 500 mev in the @xmath1 rest frame ) . for p - wave states , the leading color - singlet matrix element and the leading color - octet matrix elements are both suppressed by a factor of @xmath104 ( relative velocity of the charmed quark ) relative to the color - singlet matrix element for s - wave that can enhance the p - vawe contribution .    in the figure [ lhcbfig ] the @xmath105 distribution is presented .",
    "the @xmath106 distribution shows the maximum in the central region however , considereing the experimental observability of the @xmath1 states , one should care about the momentum of the meson to ensure the reasonable @xmath107-factor for @xmath1 and visible separation of @xmath1 decay vertex from the primary one .",
    "the right part of the same figure shows the dependence of the @xmath1 momentum on the angle .",
    "one can see that the central region is dominated by low - momentum mesons , which makes the observation of these states in the central region quite difficult task . on the other hand , the forward - backward ( lhcb acceptance )",
    "regions are dominated by very energetic mesons .    in the region of the lhcb acceptance ( @xmath108 )",
    "the expected number of events with the nominal luminosity of @xmath109 is about @xmath110 per year . taking the value of @xmath111 as an approximation for the reconstruction efficiency of the decay @xmath112 ,",
    "for example , one gets the total amount of @xmath113 reconstructed events per year .",
    "the topology of the events with @xmath1-mesons production is somewhat specific due to extreme kinematics which , particularly , is responsible for the enhancement of the forward - backward regions . the main feature of these events topology consists in the strong corellation in the direction of @xmath1 and associated @xmath84- and @xmath16-mesons momenta .",
    "one should expect an associated production of all three heavy mesons in the same hemisphere and , moreover , in sufficiently narrow cone .",
    "the family of @xmath21 mesons contains 16 narrow states .",
    "the s - wave ones will be produced in @xmath114 collisions at lhc energies with relatively large cross - sections , @xmath115 .",
    "the total cross - section of the @xmath1 production , taking into accout the cascade decays of the narrow excited states , can be as high as @xmath116 .",
    "this value is more than order of magnitude larger than at tevatron energy .",
    "the forward - backward regions of the @xmath1-mesons production are more favourable in the view of experimental observation due to the strong lorentz boost of the initial parton system .",
    "one can expect @xmath119 @xmath1 events per year inside lhcb acceptance .",
    "this amount is quite sufficient to study the spectroscopy and various decay modes , as well as the life - time of the ground state .",
    "the inclusive decay mode @xmath120 has a branching of about 17% , in comparison with @xmath191%  in @xmath121-mesons decays .",
    "these channels produce a very well visible signatures and one could expect @xmath122 events in the decay mode @xmath112 and @xmath123 events in the @xmath124 mode .",
    "the cabbibo - suppressed mode @xmath125 can be observed at the level of @xmath126 events .",
    "the most probable @xmath16-spectator decay modes are saturated by the two - body decays @xmath127 and @xmath128 , that makes these channels quite interesting for the study of the @xmath17-quark decays in the @xmath1-meson .",
    "the estimated yield of the reconstructed events could be @xmath129 events per year in the @xmath130 mode .",
    "approximately the same amount of events can be observed in other modes with @xmath131 in the final state , although with worse background conditions .",
    "rare decay modes , e.g. @xmath132 , could be interesting in view of cp - violation studies , however the preliminary estimations of the detection efficiencies and branchings involved are not too optimistic and additional studies of the reconstruction and selection procedures are required .",
