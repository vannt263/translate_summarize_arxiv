    "nonlinear energy dissipation processes governed by self - organized criticality ( soc ) exhibit the ubiquitous powerlaw distribution functions .",
    "one of the most intriguing questions in this context is still : why does nature produce powerlaws ? and",
    "the very next question is : can we understand or predict the value of the powerlaw slopes ? while per bak attempted to explain the powerlaw nature of size distributions of soc avalanches with the functional form of power spectra , such as the 1/f - noise characteristics that naturally occurs in many systems ( bak et al .",
    "1987 ) , we proposed an even more fundamental explanation for the existence of powerlaws , namely the mere statistical probability of avalanche sizes that can occur in a soc system with scale - free properties , which scales with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the euclidean dimension of the soc system ( aschwanden 2012a , b ; 2013a , b ) .",
    "this fundamental relationship , which we call the _ scale - free probability conjecture _ , predicts directly the size distributions for avalanche areas @xmath21 and volumes @xmath22 .",
    "this prediction follows from the elementary geometrical relationships that the area scales with the square of the length scale , @xmath23 , and the volume scales with the third power of the length scale , @xmath24 . while the geometric parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are space - filling within the euclidean dimension @xmath20 , the internal structure of avalanches is highly inhomogeneous and",
    "can be characterized with a fractal dimension @xmath25 , so that the instantaneous avalanche area and volume obey the scaling laws @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the haussdorf dimensions in 2d and 3d space ( aschwanden 2012a ) .",
    "these elementary geometric relationships are probably the simplest _ scaling laws _ known in nature .",
    "a convenient property of multiplicative or power - exponent scaling laws is that the powerlaw function of a size distribution of one parameter transforms into another , which is the ultimate reason why we find so many powerlaw distributions in nature .    if we want to understand the powerlaw - like size distributions found for many observables and physical parameters in solar flares , as well as to understand the mutual relationships between the powerlaw slopes of these parameters , we have obviously to look into scaling laws , which is the subject of this study . in paper",
    "i ( aschwanden , zhang , and liu 2013a ) we investigated the spatial and temporal scales of solar flares and found them to be consistent with the scale - free probability conjecture @xmath30 for the 3d euclidean space , and with a random walk transport process @xmath31 with sub - diffusive characteristics ( @xmath32 ) . analyzing euv and soft x - ray observations of solar flares involves the physical parameters of heated plasma that radiates during a flare , which can be described by the macroscopic parameters of electron temperatures @xmath33 , electron densities @xmath34 , ideal gas pressures @xmath35 , emission measures @xmath36 , and thermal energies @xmath3 . statistics of such flare parameters has been gathered for limited samples in the past , such as for flares observed in soft x - rays and euv ( pallavicini et al .  1977",

    "a universal scaling law involving a hydrostatic and a magnetic relationship was proposed by shibata and yokoyama ( 1999 ) .",
    "empirical two - parameter scaling relationships were explored by aschwanden ( 1999 ) .",
    "most of these studies were motivated by testing the loop heating scaling law of rosner - tucker - vaiana ( rtv ) ( rosner et al .  1978 ) or by testing whether the energy distribution of nanoflares is identical with that of larger flares .",
    "several of these studies suffered from insufficient broadband temperature coverage , which leads to significant underestimates of the flare energy and even affects the powerlaw slope of their distributions ( e.g. , benz and krucker 2002 ; aschwanden and parnell 2002 ) , revealing incompatible results and triggering disputes about the true flare energy distribution .",
    "a unified flare energy distribution was attempted by synthesizing statistics from different observers , instruments , and detection algorithms on the same scale ( e.g. , fig .",
    "10 in aschwanden et al .",
    "2000 ) , but doubts remained about the compatibility of different analysis methods and the role of different activity levels of the solar cycle .",
    "no study has been tackled yet that provides a consistent statistics of solar flares from the largest to the smallest flare events .",
    "the obvious next step in establishing reliable size distributions of flare energies therefore calls for a single instrument that has broadband temperature coverage and sufficient cadence to sample the peak time of the maximum energy release in flares with adequate time resolution .",
    "the answer to this call is the aia / sdo instrument , which allows us to measure all spatial , temporal , and physical parameters with unprecedented quality . in this paper",

    "we deduce the time evolution of the total emission measure @xmath59 ( integrated over the flare area ) and electron temperature @xmath60 .",
    "our observational constraints are the six euv fluxes @xmath61 , since we ignore the chromospheric channel @xmath62  in dem fits . in the following , the flux @xmath63 ( dn s@xmath64 ) always refers to the total flux integrated over the flare area , and the total emission measure @xmath36 ( @xmath10 ) is integrated over the entire flare volume .",

    "the observed functions @xmath61 can then be fitted simply by calculating the convolution of the dem function @xmath68 with the filter response functions @xmath71 ( eq .  1 ) for a set of discretized temperatures @xmath79 and gaussian widths @xmath80 , while the emission measure @xmath0 is just a constant that can be obtained from the ratio of the left - hand and right - hand side terms of eq .",

    "the choice of a gaussian is one of the simplest functions to model a dem , and thus most robust , but we caution that it may not be adadequate to characterize some broadband dems .",

    "this is quite a broad dem function .",
    "for instance , for a typical flare peak temperature of @xmath98 mk we have a fwhm temperature range from @xmath99 mk to @xmath100 mk .    using furthermore the spatial length scale @xmath101 and volume @xmath102 as determined in paper i",
    ", we can then also derive the time evolution of the average electron density ( averaged over the flare volume ) , @xmath103 where the flare volume @xmath102 is approximated by a hemispheric geometry , @xmath104 .",
    "in addition we infer also the time evolution of the thermal energy , @xmath105 these time evolutions are also shown in the third panel of fig .  1 , where it can be clearly discerned that all quantities , i.e. , the emission measure , the temperature , the density , and the thermal energy monotonically increase before the flare peak , while all drop after the flare peak , except for the flare size @xmath101 and volume @xmath102 . the fitting quality of this example is quite satisfactory , as it can be seen from the ratio of the fitted to the observed fluxes , with a mean and standard deviation of @xmath106 ( listed in fig .  1 , bottom right ) .",
    "in other words , the dem at the flare peak time can be characterized by a gaussian function that reproduces all 6 coronal euv fluxes with an accuracy of @xmath107 ( except for the 304  channel , which is of chromospheric origin and ignored here ) .",

    "the rtv scaling law ( rosner et al .  1978 ) describes a hydrostatic equilibrium solution of a coronal loop that is steadily and spatially uniformly heated , has a constant pressure , and is in equilibrium between the volumetric heating rate and the losses by radiation and thermal conduction , yielding a scaling law between the loop maximum temperature at the apex , the ( constant ) pressure , and the loop half length , as well as a scaling law for the ( constant ) volumetric heating rate .",
    "although this scaling law is generally applied to one - dimensional ( 1-d ) coronal loops , the assumption of steady heating and spatial uniformity of the heating function is often questioned , because observations and hydrodynamic modeling suggest impulsive heating functions ( e.g. , warren et al .",
    "2003 ) and non - uniform ( footpoint ) heating ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .",
    "2001 ) .    nevertheless , despite the observed violation of the steady - state assumption ,",
    "the application of the rtv scaling law is probably most adequate at one particular time of an impulsively - heated coronal loop , when it reaches the density peak @xmath175 . at this particular time",
    "the energy balance is approximately fulfilled , where the heating rate just matches the energy losses due to thermal conduction and radiative losses . before the time @xmath14",
    ", heating dominates over the losses and the temperature rises , while after this time at @xmath176 the energy losses dominate over heating and the loop temperature drops .",
    "we illustrate this hydrodynamic behavior in fig .  4 , where the temperature and density evolution is depicted according to a hydrodynamic simulation with an impulsive heating function ( see details in aschwanden and tsiklauri 2009 ) .",
    "in the evolutionary temperature - density phase diagram ( fig .  4 , right panel ) , a phase diagram that has been pioneered extensively with earlier flare data ( e.g. , jakimiec et al .  1992",
    "; sylwester et al .  1990 , 1993 ; sylwester 1996 ) , we can overlay the rtv equilibrium solution @xmath177 for the simulated loop with a half length of @xmath178 cm .",
    "if the loop would be very slowly heated , near - equilibrium energy balance could be achieved and the temperature and density rise should follow the rtv curve .",
    "however , the evolutionary curve of the hydrodynamic simulation shows that the loop temperature is always higher than the rtv equilibrium value during the heating - dominated phase , while it is lower during the cooling - dominated phase ( fig .  4 , right panel ) .",
    "the rtv solution predicts the correct loop temperature and density only at one point in time , near the peak density time @xmath179 , where the peak density @xmath180 is reached and the temperature dropped to about half of the maximum temperature , @xmath181 .",
    "thus the rtv law is a useful predictor for the density @xmath2 and temperature @xmath1 when the emission of the loop is brightest , since the emission measure @xmath0 scales with the squared density @xmath34 and line - of - sight column depth @xmath182 , i.e. , @xmath183 .",
    "while the foregoing argument was made for a single loop in an active region , we are using now the same argument of the applicability of the rtv scaling law for the flare peak time @xmath14 , when the thermal emission of a flare in soft x - ray wavelengths is brightest , such as during the goes peak time @xmath14 of the flare . comparing the evolutionary phase diagram @xmath184 of the total flare emission of an observed flare ( fig .  1 , bottom left panel ) with the hydrodynamic simulation of an impulsively - heated single loop ( fig .  4 , right panel )",

    "can we apply the rtv scaling law to multi - loop geometries ?",
    "spatial high - resolution observations from trace and aia / sdo clearly demonstrate the multi - loop structure of solar flares .",
    "one particular flare , the bastille - day-2000 flare has been modeled in detail and a multitude of at least @xmath185 individual postflare loops have been identified for this x5.7 goes - class flare ( aschwanden and alexander 2001 ) .",
    "even the simplest and smallest nanoflares appear to be composed of multiple loops ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .",
    "such multi - loop geometries can be modeled most simply by arcades of loops , straddling along a neutral line , as visualized in fig .",
    "5 . in paper",
    "i , however , we measured the projected flare area @xmath186 and defined a length scale @xmath187 that corresponds to the radius of an equivalent circular area @xmath5 .",
    "the question arises now how can we relate this flare length scale @xmath4 to the loop half length @xmath188 used in the rtv scaling law , and to multi - loop models of flares .",
    "the semi - cylindrical multi - loop arcade model shown in fig .",
    "5 has a projected area that can be characterized with a rectangular shape with a length @xmath189 and width @xmath190 , yielding an area of @xmath191 , or a radius @xmath192 of an equivalent circular area @xmath5 .",
    "the loop half length @xmath188 for the largest loops contained in the arcade scale as @xmath193 for single - loop cases , to @xmath194 for large multi - loop arcades , so the geometric mean is a good approximation , @xmath195    in principle , a multi - loop arcade consisting of an array of loops with different ( half ) lengths @xmath188 as a function of the radial distance @xmath196 from the neutral line could be modeled by a superposition of rtv loops , according to the scaling laws for the heating rates @xmath15 and apex temperatures , which can then be summed up to produce a dem distribution for each time of a flare , and can then be related to the overall length scale @xmath4 of the flare . however , since the spatial distribution of the heating rate @xmath15 is unknown and is likely to be spatially non - uniform , no simple model can be made with certainty _ a priori_. our working assumption is that loops with a half length of @xmath197 demarcate the brightest loops in the flare arcade , from which the flare area @xmath198 is measured , and thus this loop ( half ) length @xmath197 is the most relevant parameter in the application of the rtv law to estimate the peak emission measure @xmath0 and peak temperature @xmath1 for a flare with a hemispheric volume @xmath199 and radius @xmath4 .      the rtv law ( rosner et al .  1978",
    ") specifies a 3-parameter relationship between the flare peak temperature @xmath1 , the ( spatially averaged ) peak electron density @xmath2 , and length scale @xmath200 , measured at the flare peak time @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we can express the rtv law as a function of these three parameters @xmath151 , by inserting @xmath201 ( eq .",
    "12 ) , and defining @xmath202 and @xmath203 , to predict each of the three parameters as a function of the other two , @xmath204 @xmath205 @xmath206 these are predicted 3-parameter correlations that can be tested with our data .",
    "another useful parameter is the total emission measure @xmath0 , defined by the integral over the flare volume @xmath6 , @xmath207 furthermore , we will also determine the distribution of thermal energies , @xmath208 which can be expressed as a function of the peak temperature @xmath1 and length scale @xmath122 by substituting the rtv scaling law for the density @xmath2 ( eq .  14 ) .",
    "in addition we have the rtv heating rate scaling law , @xmath209    our data provide the measurements of the independent parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath122 , which allows us to test the applicability of the rtv law . in fig .",
    "6a we show the rtv - predicted flare peak temperature @xmath210 ( eq .  13 ) as a function of the observed flare peak temperature @xmath1 and find a good agreement within a factor of @xmath211 , which means that the rtv law predicts the flare temperature with an accuracy of @xmath212 in the range of @xmath213 mk .",
    "similarly we test the predicted peak densities @xmath214 ( eq .",

    "we conclude that the rtv law represents a physical model that is adequate to explain the relationship between geometric flare parameters @xmath221 and the hydrodynamic fluid parameters of the electron temperature @xmath1 and density @xmath2 at the time of the flare peak .",
    "this corroborates our assumption that energy balance between heating and cooling processes is achieved during the flare peak time , even in the case of a dynamic evolution that is different from the steady - state condition under which the rtv law was derived originally .      in the next step",
    "we like to understand the powerlaw slopes of the observed size distributions ( fig .",
    "2 ) in terms of the rtv scaling law .",
    "the histogrammed distribution functions show powerlaws at the right - hand side of the distributions , but reveal also a rollover at the left - hand side , which is primarily a consequence of incomplete sampling of small events , as well as truncation effects that need to be included in modeling of the size distributions . in fig .  7",
    "we show the same size distributions as in fig .  2 , but juxtapose also scatterplots of the various parameters ( x - axis ) with the length scale ( y - axis ) , which clearly show how the rollover in the size distributions relate to truncation effects in the scatterplots .",
    "there are two truncation effects that we include in modeling the size distributions : ( i ) a lower limit @xmath222 erg @xmath10 s@xmath64 of the heating rate distribution @xmath223 ( shown as dotted vertical line in fig .",

    "we see that these truncation boundaries , caclulated analytically from the rtv law , demarcate the observed ranges of datapoints in the scatterplots quite well .",
    "obviously , they also affect the powerlaw slopes of the parameter distributions .",
    "there are two methods to corroborate the rtv scaling and the resulting truncation effects theoretically : ( i ) by a monte - carlo simulation ( which we describe in the following and show in fig .",
    "8) , and ( ii ) by analytical calculations ( which we derive in appendix a ) .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation can easily be performed by generating two sets of parameters according to the two prescribed distributions of length scales @xmath122 ( following the scale - free probability conjecture , as verified by measurements in paper i ) , @xmath227 and volumetric heating rates @xmath15 , for which we also assume a powerlaw distribution for mathematical convenience ( for a justification see also the analytical derivation of a scaling law for the coronal heating rate in appendix b ) , @xmath228 a sample of values @xmath229 that obey a powerlaw distribution @xmath142 with a lower cuotff of @xmath230 can simply be generated by the relationship ( aschwanden 2012a ) , @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a random number drawn from the interval @xmath233 $ ] with a uniform probability distribution @xmath234 that can be obtained from a random generator . this way we simulate a set of values @xmath235 and @xmath236 that form the probability distributions @xmath237 ( eq .  19 ) and @xmath238 ( eq .  20 ) , were we choose the lower limits @xmath239 cm and @xmath240 erg @xmath10 obtained from the observed distributions ( fig .",

    "we obtain then the temperature values @xmath243 according to the rtv energy rate scaling law ( eq .  18 ) , and the density values @xmath244 from the rtv density scaling law ( eq .  14 ) , the total emission measure values @xmath245 ( eq .  16 ) , the ( hemispheric ) flare volumes @xmath246 , and the thermal energies @xmath247 ( eq .  17 ) .",
    "the resulting parameter distributions @xmath248 for @xmath249 are shown in fig .",

    "also an emission measure threshold @xmath250 that corresponds to the selection threshold of goes m1-class flares in the observations , a maximum active region size limit @xmath251 cm that corresponds to an upper diameter limit of @xmath252 mm for the largest flares observed in this dataset , and a maximum temperature of @xmath253 k , which is a limit imposed by the aia / sdo euv temperature filters . using these limits",

    "as mentioned above , the second method to corroborate the rtv scaling and the resulting truncation effects theoretically , is by analytical calculations of the truncated size distributions , which we derive in appendix a. the final results of these analytically derived size distributions are shown as red curves in fig .  8 , which approximately agree with the monte - carlo simulations ( black histograms in fig .",
    "8) and the observations ( fig .",
    "we note that the truncation effects introduce some slight deviations from strict powerlaws , whose origin can be fully understood in terms of different truncation regimes in the analytical calculations ( presented in appendix a ) .",
    "finally we want to understand the size distributions @xmath257 of fluxes @xmath52 that are measured with different instrumental temperature filters , and thus are wavelength - dependent . in fig .",
    "9 ( panels in top half ) we show the correlations between the observed fluxes @xmath52 and the peak emission measure @xmath0 , as they have been determined from gaussian dem fits to the observed fluxes . in other words",
    ", if we know the three physical parameters of a gaussian dem ( @xmath258 ) for a particular flare event , we want to know how well we can predict the observed fluxes @xmath52 with a given instrument channel .",
    "if a particular wavelength filter has a broad temperature response or if the observed flare has a broad dem , we would expect a good proportionality between the recorded flux and the peak emission measure .",
    "the cross - correlation of the fluxes @xmath52 observed with aia or goes and the peak emission measures @xmath0 indeed are relatively high in all cases , with cross - correlation coefficients in the range of @xmath259 ( fig .",
    "9 , panels in upper half ) , and the linear regression coefficients are in the range of @xmath260 , which indicates near - proportionality .",
    "the best proportionality is found for the 94 , 131 , and goes channels , while the largest deviation ( with a non - linearity of @xmath261 is found for the chromospheric 304  channel , as expected .",
    "a more accurate prediction of the observed fluxes @xmath52 can be made by convolving the model ( gaussian ) dem function with the instrumental response function @xmath71 ( eq .  1 ) , which is shown in fig",
    ".  9 ( panels in lower half ) .",
    "if the data match a gaussian dem perfectly , we expect an exact proportionality between the observed @xmath52 and modeled fluxes @xmath262 .",
    "the best proportionality is found for the 171  channel ( @xmath263 , @xmath264 ) , the 193  channel ( @xmath265 , @xmath266 ) , and the 335  channel ( @xmath267 , @xmath268 ) , while the 304  channel shows the largest deviation in terms of absolute flux . the observed 304  flux is almost an order of magnitude higher than the flare dem predicts , because this filter is also sensitive to chromospheric temperatures ( @xmath269 ) , which is not included in the single - gaussian fit of the dem .",
    "a second gaussian component would be needed to accomodate a double - peaked dem function . however , since we ignored the 304  channel in our dem modeling , the mismatch of the 304  flux is not a problem . although the 304  channel is not used in the dem fit , its flux can be predicted ( fig .",
    "9 ) based on the best - fit dem flux from the six coronal channels .",
    "the reason why a relatively good correlation is found between the observed ( mostly chromospheric ) 304  flux and the predicted ( mostly corona - based ) dem flux is probably due to the flare - induced chromospheric heating , which is manifested in a commonly visible impulsive brightening of the 304   flux at beginning of the impulsive flare phase .",
    "this good correlation makes the 304  flux to a good flare predictor , which in fact amounted to 79% of all flare detections obtained with the two stereo spacecraft ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2013b ) .",
    "our dem - predicted ( fitted ) fluxes match the observed fluxes with a mean ratio and standard deviation of @xmath270 , which indicates that a single gaussian fit yields a viable model for the dem function of flares .",
    "after we described the data analysis and the theoretical modeling in the foregoing sections 2 and 3 , we put now the results into a larger context , by comparing them with previous studies ( section 4.1 , 4.2 ) , considering implications for the coronal heating problem ( section 4.3 ) , solar versus stellar scaling laws ( section 4.4 ) , the prediction of the largest and smallest solar flare event ( section 4.5 ) , and the prediction of powerlaw distribution functions for self - organized criticality models ( section 4.6 ) .",

    "it was already pointed out early on that powerlaw distributions @xmath305 of energies with a slope flatter than the critical value of @xmath306 imply that the energy integral diverges at the upper end , and thus the total energy of the distribution is dominated by the largest events ( hudson et al .",

    "thus , based on the statistics of large flares we do not see any evidence that would support nanoflare heating , at least not for flares with energies @xmath311 erg . this argument , however , does not rule out that the powerlaw slope could steepen at smaller energies .",

    "<S> in this study we measure physical parameters of the same set of 155 m and x - class solar flares observed with aia / sdo as analyzed in paper i , by performing a _ differential emission measure ( dem ) _ analysis to determine the flare peak emission measure @xmath0 , peak temperature @xmath1 , electron density @xmath2 , and thermal energy @xmath3 , in addition to the spatial scales @xmath4 , areas @xmath5 , and volumes @xmath6 measured in paper i. the parameter ranges for m and x - class flares are : @xmath7 , @xmath8 mk , @xmath9 @xmath10 , and thermal energies of @xmath11 erg . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these parameters obey the rosner - tucker - vaiana ( rtv ) scaling law @xmath12 and @xmath13 during the peak time @xmath14 of the flare density @xmath2 , when energy balance between the heating rate @xmath15 and the conductive and radiative loss rates is achieved for a short instant , and thus enables the applicability of the rtv scaling law . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the rtv scaling law predicts powerlaw distributions for all physical parameters , which we demonstrate with numerical monte - carlo simulations as well as with analytical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the rtv law is also that we can retrieve the size distribution of heating rates , for which we find @xmath16 , which is consistent with the magnetic flux distribution @xmath17 observed by parnell et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) and the heating flux scaling law @xmath18 of schrijver et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fractal - diffusive self - organized criticality model in conjunction with the rtv scaling law reproduces the observed powerlaw distributions and their slopes for all geometrical and physical parameters and can be used to predict the size distributions for other flare datasets , instruments , and detection algorithms . </S>"
