    "the notion of distance between two objects is very general .",
    "distance metrics and distances have now become an essential tool in many areas of mathematics and its applications including geometry , probability , statistics , coding / graph theory , data analysis , pattern recognition . for a comprehensive source on this subject see @xcite . the notion of a fuzzy set",
    "was introduced by @xcite .",
    "it is a class of objects with continuous values of membership and hence extends the classical definition of a set ( to distinguish it from a fuzzy set we refer to it as a crisp set ) .",
    "formally , a fuzzy set is a pair @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a set of objects and @xmath5 is a membership function @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise , such as pattern recognition , decision theory .",
    "the concept of distance and similarity is important in the area of fuzzy logic and sets .",
    "we now review some common ways of defining distances on fuzzy sets ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "classical distances measure how far two points are in euclidean space .",
    "for instance , the minkowski distance between two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath9 is defined as@xmath10 let @xmath4 be a finite set and let @xmath11 be the set of all fuzzy subsets of @xmath4 . consider @xmath1,@xmath2 two fuzzy subsets @xmath1 , @xmath12 with membership functions @xmath13,@xmath14 $ ] .",
    "then ( [ eq : minkow ] ) can be extended to the following distance , @xmath15 based on ( [ eq : minkow ] ) letting @xmath16 we have the hausdorff distance between two non - empty compact crisp sets @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 this can be extended to fuzzy sets as follows : let @xmath20 be a fuzzy set and denote by @xmath21 the @xmath22-level set of the fuzzy set @xmath1 which is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "then for two fuzzy subsets @xmath1 , @xmath12 the distance in ( [ eq : quv ] ) can be extended to the following distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2,@xmath24 another approach is based on set - theoretic distance functions . for a fuzzy set @xmath20 define the cardinality of @xmath1 as @xmath25 . extend the intersection and union operations by defining the membership functions@xmath26 and    @xmath27 then for fuzzy sets @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath12 we may define the distance function@xmath28 another distance is based on four features of a fuzzy set .",
    "let the domain of interest be @xmath29 and consider a fuzzy set @xmath1 in @xmath30 .",
    "the power of @xmath1 ( which extends the notion of cardinality ) is defined as @xmath31 let @xmath32 then define the entropy of @xmath1 as @xmath33 define the centroid as @xmath34 and the skewness as @xmath35 let @xmath36 $ ] then @xcite defines the distance between two fuzzy sets @xmath1 , @xmath37 as the euclidean distance @xmath38 .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the notion of distances that are based on descriptive complexity of sets .",
    "a good distance is one which picks out only the ` true ' dissimilarities and ignores factors that arise from irrelevant variables or due to unimportant random fluctuations that enter the measurements . in most applications",
    "the design of a good distance requires inside information about the domain , for instance , in the field of information retrieval @xcite the distance between two documents is weighted largely by words that appear less frequently since the words which appear more frequently are less informative .",
    "typically , different domains require the design of different distance functions which take such specific prior knowledge into account .",
    "it can therefore be an expensive process to acquire expertise in order to formulate a good distance .",
    "recently , a new distance for sets was introduced @xcite which is based on the concept of descriptional complexity ( or discrete entropy ) .",
    "a description of an object in a finite set can be represented as a finite binary string which provides a unique index of the object in the set .",
    "the description complexity of the object is the minimal length of a string that describes the object .",
    "the distance of @xcite is based on the idea that two sets should be considered similar if given the knowledge of one the additional complexity in describing an element of the other set is small ( this is also referred to as the conditional combinatorial entropy , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advantage in this formulation of distance is its universality , i.e. , it can be applied without any prior knowledge or assumption about the domain of interest , i.e. , the elements that the sets contain .",
    "such a distance can be viewed as an information - based distance since the conditional descriptional complexity is essentially the amount of information needed to describe an element in one set given that we know the other set ( for more on the notion of combinatorial information and entropy see @xcite ) .    in the current paper",
    "we introduce a distance function between two general sets , i.e. , sets that can be crisp or fuzzy .",
    "following the information - based approach of @xcite we resort to entropy as the main operator that gives the measure of dissimilarity between two sets .",
    "we use the membership of the symmetric difference of two sets as the probability of a bernoulli random variable whose entropy is the expected description complexity of an element that belongs to only one of the two sets .",
    "thus the distance function measures how many bits ( on average ) are needed to describe an element in the symmetric difference of the two sets .",
    "in other words , it is the amount of additional information needed to describe any one of the two sets given knowledge of the other .",
    "being a description - complexity based distance gives it certain characteristic properties .",
    "for instance , the distance between a crisp set @xmath1 and its complement @xmath39 is zero since there is no need for additional information in order to describe one of these two sets when knowing the other .",
    "that is , knowledge of a set @xmath1 automatically implies knowing the set @xmath39 and vice versa .",
    "they are clearly not equal but our distance function cleverly renders them as the most similar that two sets can be ( zero distance apart ) .",
    "the next section formally introduces the distance and in theorem [ thm : the - function- ] we prove its metric properties .",
    "we write _ w.p . _ for `` with probability ''",
    ". let @xmath40=\\left\\ { 1,\\ldots , n\\right\\ } $ ] be a domain of interest .",
    "let @xmath41)$ ] be a set with membership function @xmath42\\rightarrow[0,1]$ ] .",

    "the distance can be defined as the expected value of @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a random variable with some probability distribution @xmath61 with respect to which the expectation is computed .",
    "the next theorem shows that the distance satisfies the metric properties .",
    "[ thm : the - function-]the function @xmath62 is a semi - metric on @xmath63)$ ] , i.e. , it is non - negative , symmetric , it equals zero if @xmath64 and it satisfies the triangle inequality .",

    "@xmath137 then it follows that @xmath138 and [ eq : fp ] holds .",
