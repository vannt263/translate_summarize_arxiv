    "@xmath2 might be considered as p - wave excited state with @xmath5 quarks . however , since the mass of @xmath2 is about 30 mev below the @xmath6 threshold , it has also been suggested that @xmath2 is the s - wave @xmath6 quasi bound state due to the strongly attractive s - wave interaction of the @xmath6 system with @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "the strange dibaryon resonances can be produced by photon- or kaon - induced reactions on light nuclei such as @xmath9 and @xmath10he , and the signal of the resonances may be observed in the invariant mass and/or missing mass distributions of the decay products .",
