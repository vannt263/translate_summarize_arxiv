    "the effect of flow on the conformation of surface tethered polymers is an area of study of increasing pertinence as advances in materials science , nanofabrication techniques and chemistry are incorporated into the engines of industry . whether tethered polymers are used to prevent protein fouling in biomedical devices ( such as through pegylation of blood wetting devices ) , anchor receptors in lab - on - a - chip enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) @xcite , replace frictional contacts with viscous contacts through weeping lubrication @xcite or serve a structural purpose within the device ( e.g. nylon submicron filters ) , understanding how a flow field modifies the behaviour of a polymer chain can improve the design and functionality of these devices @xcite .",
    "while many of these devices consist of polymer layers , where intermolecular polymer interactions are common , isolated tethered polymer chains , where intermolecular polymer interactions are absent , can also be present in these devices .",
    "the behaviour of isolated tethered polymer chains under pure shear flow was examined theoretically well before an experimental apparatus could be devised to study the phenomenon .",
    "the earliest model consisted of a brownian dynamics simulation of a single bead connected by a hookean spring to surface in a linear shear field @xcite . beyond the intuitive prediction that the polymer would extend into the direction of flow and adopt a stretched configuration ,",
    "this simple model predicted that instead of assuming a steady conformation in the flow field , the tethered bead would undergo cyclical dynamics that could be described as a four part cycle of _ entrainment _ , _ rotation _ , _ contraction _ and _ extension_. during the _ entrainment _ step the bead is entrained in the flow field and the polymer chain is stretched . during the _ rotation _ step ,",
    "the force on the bead is balanced by the force constant of the spring . in the case of a polymer chain the effective `` spring '' is created by the entropic loss of the polymer chain as it is extended and loses configurational freedom . as the bead",
    "is now fixed at a set distance from the adhesion point , it is rotated towards the wall of the channel . in the _ contraction _",
    "step , as the bead is rotated towards the wall of the channel , it rotates out of the flow field and , no longer being entrained in the flow field , it retracts back towards the wall",
    ". finally , in the _ extension _ step , as the bead nears the anchor point , the brownian diffusion of the bead carries it away from the wall where it becomes entrained in the flow field again .",
    "these dynamics were subsequently confirmed experimentally by studies of tethered dna oligomers in aqueous solution @xcite although the resolution of the data was insufficient to perform a quantitative analysis of the dynamics .",
    "cyclical dynamics also have been predicted by other theoretical models @xcite .",
    "when these dynamics are manifest , there is some question as to whether or not they are periodic in nature . in a brownian dynamics simulation of a fene chain in a linear",
    "shear field the dynamics appeared to be periodic with a period roughly equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the relaxation time of the polymer chain @xcite . using a simplified system of three beads bound by hookean springs to the points of an equilateral triangle , the study of holzer et",
    "al @xcite found a hopf bifurcation in the position of the beads as the shear rate was increased . at low shear rates the polymer extended into the direction of flow , at intermediate shear rates a limit cycle emerged corresponding to periodic oscillations , which became aperiodic at higher shear rates .",
    "in contrast , cyclical dynamics were not found in studies where a rigid bond model was used instead of a spring model @xcite suggesting that bond elasticity may be necessary for this phenomenon to emerge .",
    "more recently the study of zhang et al @xcite studied cyclical dynamics using three methods : brownian dyanamics , lattice boltzmann and mixed direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc)-molecular dynamics ( md ) method .",
    "they found that the dynamics were aperiodic and suggested that the cyclical dynamics may be caused by a poisson process like the tumbling of untethered polymers under shear flow @xcite .",
    "if the tumbling process is a poisson process , then the delay between tumbling events should follow an exponential distribution .",
    "in addition to the brownian dynamics approach , the effects of flow on tethered polymer chains have also been examined using monte carlo simulations @xcite , md @xcite , dsmc @xcite and multiparticle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite .",
    "the previously mentioned studies of the effect of a flow field on a tethered polymer only considered a pure shear flow .",
    "however , there is often slip flow within these devices and there can be an elongational component to the flow if the fluid is compressible .",
    "the effect of the compressibility of the medium is particularly important in gas flows .",
    "as the contraction step of the cycle assumes that the fluid has no velocity near the wall , the presence of a slip velocity alone alters the dynamics .    in this paper , the behavior of a tethered oligomer",
    "is examined in a pressure - driven flow field of a compressible gas under two different solvent conditions ; a solvent condition where the oligomer assumes an equilibrium conformation in solvent that is equivalent to its vacuum configuration ( ideal solvent ) , and a more compact configuration ( poor solvent ) . under ideal solvent conditions",
    "it is shown that the cyclical dynamics are restricted to the end of the chain and are aperiodic under pressure - driven flow . under poor solvent conditions",
    "the oligomer adopts a helical configuration instead of undergoing cyclical dynamics .    to simulate the flow on the oligomer",
    ", the dynamics were studied using a hybrid mpcd@xcite and md algorithm .",
    "a md algorithm was necessary as the oligomer model made use of an explicit potential .",
    "the mpcd algorithm was chosen as the interparticle distance was significant relative to the length scale over which dynamical variables changed and , as a particle based algorithm , it was easy to interface with a molecular dynamics algorithm .",
    "the flow profile was modeled on a pressure driven compressible fluid flow within a nanofluidic channel using slip boundary conditions .",
    "the following section of the article , section 2 , presents the oligomer model that was simulated in this article , the mpcd algorithm that was used to simulate the fluid and the dimensionless numbers that characterize the physical significance of these models .",
    "the results for the ideal solvent conditions and poor solvent conditions are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "the final section of the article , section 5 , contains a summary of the results and the potential implications for practical applications .",
    "the essential difficulty with the simulation of the effect of channel flow on the conformation of an oligomer is the existence of two disparate time and length scales within the system associated with evolution of the flow profile within the channel and the configuration of the oligomer . due to the elongational component of the flow field",
    ", a significant portion of the channel needs to be simulated to capture the flow profile .",
    "in particular , the entire cross - section of the channel must be simulated , as well as a sufficient portion of the channel both upstream and downstream of the oligomer to establish the flow field and accommodate inlet and outlet artefacts .",
    "the flow variables such as pressure , density , temperature and velocity also require approximately a nanosecond to attain a steady state .",
    "this requires a continuum approach or a mesoscopic model .",
    "however , to simulate the effect of this field on the oligomer , the oligomer must be represented by a model of sufficient complexity to capture subtle changes in the native conformation , which requires integration steps in the femtosecond range .",
    "thus the oligomer requires a md integration approach . as a result of these requirements ,",
    "a hybrid md - mpcd algorithm@xcite was used to approach this simulation .",
    "the mpcd algorithm has the advantage of impressive speed of simulation while preserving hydrodynamics@xcite and , being particle based , it is straightforward to adapt the model to incorporate the md subsystem for the oligomeric chains .",
    "the oligomer model itself is simplified from a complete molecular description of a homopolymer .",
    "it maintains the backbone structure of the chain but removes the side groups of the chain , incorporating them into the backbone beads .",
    "this facilitates the use of a larger integration time step and decreases the number of variables that could affect the configuration of the oligomer itself , leading to results that have general applicability .",
    "channel flow for a compressible fluid within a nanoscopic channel is complicated by several factors ; the fluid is expanding due to an isentropic expansion as the pressure decreases , the fluid is being sheared by frictional interactions with the walls of the channel , and the fluid is slipping at the walls of the channels . due to the complexity of this flow ,",
    "the flow profile was simulated using a mpcd algorithm , and a md subsystem was introduced to model the interactions between the fluid and the oligomer .    in order to streamline the standard molecular dynamics equations ,",
    "the mpcd algorithm forgoes the use of an explicit potential between solvent particles .",
    "the domain is subdivided into cells of edge length @xmath2 nm . at discrete time intervals ,",
    "@xmath3 , particles sharing the same cell have their velocity rotated about the average cell velocity , @xmath4 , by an angle @xmath5 .",
    "i.e. velocity of the @xmath6 particle in the cell , @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pre - rotation velocity of the particle and @xmath10 is the matrix for a rotation through an angle @xmath5 , about an axis @xmath11 .",
    "the magnitude of the rotation is kept constant during the simulation , for the simulations presented here @xmath12 . in three dimensions",
    "there are two models for the choice of the direction about which the rotation is performed .",
    "either the rotation is performed about any randomly chosen direction @xcite , or the rotation is performed about a randomly chosen cartesian axis of the system @xcite .",
    "the forms of the transport coefficients are somewhat different between the two methods @xcite .",
    "the first model has the advantage of assuring the proper rotational symmetry for the stress tensor of the fluid , while the second method is slightly more efficient . for the purposes of modeling channel flow",
    "the second model is sufficient , thus it is used here . for this fluid",
    "the transport coefficients are @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of the fluid particle , @xmath15 is the shear viscosity of the fluid , @xmath16 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath17 is the self - diffusion coefficient of fluid particles , @xmath18 is the average number of particles per cell and @xmath19 the algorithm also randomly shifts cells prior to rotation and shifts them back following a rotation by a random displacement vector @xmath20 to eliminate the effect of momentum correlations from particles being in the same cells during subsequent rotations @xcite , however as the mean free path length is greater than @xmath21 , this procedure is not strictly required .",
    "although there is no local structure or excluded volume interactions in the mpcd model fluid , there is still momentum transfer between particles .",
    "it is possible to introduce some excluded volume interactions by modifying the algorithm to introduce specular collisions between particles in cells where the average cell velocity indicates that the particles are travelling towards each other @xcite .",
    "a closed mpcd system still conserves mass , momentum and energy .",
    "it can be shown through an h - theorem that an mpcd system evolves to a state of maximum entropy and , in the low rarefaction limit , reproduces hydrodynamics consistent with the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of introducing a physical connection between the simulation data and a real fluid , @xmath3 was selected to be equal to the mean collision time for the gas being modeled .",
    "i.e. , @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 is the particle radius @xmath25 amu is the particle mass , @xmath26 k and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the inlet and outlet pressure .",
    "@xmath28 was held constant for all simulations at @xmath29 mpa ( corresponding to a particle density of @xmath30 particles / cell ) , while @xmath27 was varied to generate a pressure gradient .",
    "the mpcd algorithm used here was not integrated using the rotational period @xmath3 .",
    "instead a time step , @xmath31 @xmath32 that was shorter than @xmath3 was used for numerical integration . as @xmath33",
    ", a shorter time step was required for the stable application of the inlet and outlet boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions operated by modifying the particle distributions on a cell - by - cell basis at each time step , thus if the distribution changed significantly between intervals it would produce artefacts in the flow profile .",
    "the use of a shorter time step also allowed the velocity to be truncated at @xmath34 to prevent particles from traveling more than one cell length in a single time step .",
    "as @xmath35 , very few particles require truncation and having a screening range of particle motion simplified the construction of the md susbsystem during each @xmath36 interval . in the simulations of different pressure differences presented here , @xmath3 ranged from @xmath37 for equilibrium simulations to @xmath38 for the highest flow rate simulations .",
    "measurements that involve the variance of the distribution were corrected for the omission of these few high velocity particles by multiplying the measured variance by the ratio of the variance of the complete maxwell - boltzmann distribution to the variance of the truncated maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "a leap - frog integration scheme with a time step @xmath39 , was used to simulate the oligomer and its interactions with the fluid@xcite .",
    "as the fluid particles do not interact directly with each other , the algorithm requires the integration of the equations of motion of only particles that could interact with the oligomer between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . due to the velocity truncation ,",
    "the maximum distance a particle can be from the oligomer and still interact is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the cut off radius of the fluid - oligomer potential .",
    "hence , in order to interface the oligomer model with the mpcd channel , a cell envelope that contains all the particles that are within at least @xmath42 of the oligomer is separated from the system and integrated with time step @xmath44 , creating a hybrid md - mpcd system .",
    "the overall technique is similar to that employed in malevanets and kapral @xcite , but simplified due to the velocity truncation .    due to the complexities introduced by the elongational component of the flow field , mechanisms for generating a pure shear flow field such as sliding brick @xcite boundary conditions or a systemic force field @xcite are not appropriate . instead",
    ", the flow field is created by a source - sink boundary condition algorithm that establishes a pressure gradient at the inlet and outlet via the addition and removal of particles from the inlet and outlet of the system @xcite .",
    "particles were added from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature to supply thermal control .",
    "the mean velocity , used for the calculation of the thermal velocity , was calculated using a series solution to the navier - stokes solution for the isothermal flow of an ideal gas in a square channel at the inlet , while a spatial and temporal local average was used in the outlet .",
    "the interactions between the solvent particles and the wall were modelled by an adiabatic collision operator , where the component of particle velocity that is normal to the wall is reflected and the remaining components are rotated by an angle that is uniformly drawn from the @xmath45 interval .",
    "the algorithm is presented in full detail elsewhere@xcite , complete with details on the boundary conditions and implementation .",
    "the simulations were performed in a @xmath46 channel of square geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) with the oligomer chain anchored to the centre of the channel at @xmath47 , with the @xmath48-axis representing the direction of flow .",
    "initially the oligomer is absent from the channel , which is initialized to a pressure corresponding to the inlet pressure .",
    "the system is allowed to equilibrate for @xmath49 @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath50 @xmath51 , and the flow profile is generated from a washout distribution , where the channel is initially filled to the higher inlet pressure and the gradient is allowed to form from the drainage of particles through the outlet .",
    "this has the advantage of more rapid equilibration than the inverse fill - up distribution , where the system is equilibrated to the outlet pressure and particles are added through the inlet to create the gradient , and avoids the creation of shocks within the system . at @xmath49 @xmath36 , the oligomer is inserted into the channel , with a straight configuration extended along the x axis , where each bead is separated from the previous by the equilibrium bond length .",
    "this is done to remove some variation between runs and to observe the relaxation time of the oligomer .",
    "each bead is given an initial velocity drawn from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with @xmath52 @xmath34 .",
    "any fluid particles that have a non - zero potential with the oligomer chain at the time of insertion are deleted .",
    "a critical factor determining the behavior of the oligomeric chain under shear flow is the structure and potentials used to model the oligomer .",
    "as the mpcd solvent used in these simulations lacks short range order , a similarly simple oligomeric chain was chosen , where each repeat unit of the oligomer is replaced by single bead and each bead is connected to the subsequent bead through a spring potential .",
    "this oligomeric chain is representative of an oligomer such as polyethylene or poly(tetrafluoroethlyene ) where there are no large side groups on the chain and the repeat unit for the chain can be reduced to each backbone carbon ( e.g. @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "whenever physical data were required , the data for polyethylene were used to model the oligomer .",
    "additional potentials are defined between oligomer beads and : other oligomer beads that do not share a bond , mpcd fluid particles and the channel wall . for these simulations",
    "each oligomer bead had a mass that was @xmath55 @xmath14 and a radius of @xmath56 @xmath21 .",
    "the length of the oligomer was held constant at @xmath57 beads .",
    "the parameters for the potentials described below are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the oligomer chain bond potential was modeled as a finitely extendable non - linear elastic ( fene ) spring @xcite with a modification to allow for an equilibrium bond length .",
    "i.e. the bond potential was : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the separation vector between the position of bead @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the equilibrium bond length ( thus @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the extensibility limits ) and @xmath65 is the spring constant for the bond .",
    "the potential is zero at the equilibrium bond length and infinite at a separation of either @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "hence there is a limit on the extension of the oligomer , just as there would be for a physical bond . in theory",
    "this limit is @xmath64 , though , due to the choice of parameter values , the bond length stays within the range of @xmath66 to @xmath67 under the specified simulation conditions .",
    "this potential was also used to tether the oligomer to the wall at the anchor point .",
    "the interactions between the oligomer beads and the fluid particles were modeled by a scaled lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential of the form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy at the minimum of the potential",
    "well and @xmath70 is the particle separation of minimum energy .",
    "while the lennard - jones potential is a standard model for an inter - molecular potential , the attractive portion of the potential when used as an oligomer - solvent potential could act to cross - link the oligomer when there are no explicit solvent - solvent potentials present .",
    "solvent - solvent interactions prevent multiple solvent particles from occupying the same volume within interaction range of the oligomer .",
    "if the attractive potential is strong enough to bind a solvent particle , it can bind multiple solvent particles to the same site and these solvent particles can act to cross - link the oligomeric chain . instead of a model that is closer to the physical reality of the situation , the model creates a magnified primary solvation shell with no secondary structure . within the parameter range chosen to model this interaction ,",
    "this phenomena did not occur as there was no solvent density increase in the vicinity of the oligomer .",
    "the lennard - jones potential was used to simulate both poor solvent and ideal solvent conditions .",
    "a ideal solvent is one in which the enthalpy of mixing for the solvent and the polymer is zero , and the polymer adopts the same conformation that it would in the absence of a solvent . in theory an ideal solvent for a polymer would be a @xmath71 solvent .",
    "theoretically , under @xmath71 solvent conditions the radius of gyration of a tethered polymer is expected to have a similar magnitude to an untethered polymer and scale with the length as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the number of kuhn segments in the chain and @xmath62 is the length of the segment@xcite . however , unlike a true polymer , the excluded volume interactions in the core of a short - chained oligomer prevent the oligomer from adopting gaussian chain characteristics @xcite and the oligomer assumes a configuration at least as large as a self - avoiding chain@xcite , @xmath74 , where the proportionality constant is specific to the oligomer being examined . as such we use the term ideal solvent instead of @xmath71 solvent and state",
    "that if the oligomer adopts a smaller conformation than its vacuum configuration , the solvent is said to be a poor solvent , while if it adopts a larger conformation in the solvent than in vacuum , the solvent is said to be a good solvent . hence the solvent conditions were estimated by comparing the radius of gyration of the oligomer in the solvent , to the radius of gyration of the oligomer in the absence of a solvent under equilibrium conditions , as opposed to comparing the size of the oligomer to gaussian chain statistics .",
    "the radius of gyration of an oligomer is written as , @xmath75 where @xmath73 is the number of beads in the oligomeric chain , @xmath76 is the position vector of the @xmath6 bead in the polymer chain and @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath48 components of the radius of gyration .",
    "these components are analogous to the radius of gyration and are formed using the @xmath80 , @xmath81 or @xmath48 component of @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath82 in the absence of a solvent , a centimer was found to have a radius of gyration of @xmath83 @xmath21 , while the radius of gyration was @xmath84 @xmath21 under ideal solvent conditions and @xmath85 @xmath21 under poor solvent conditions .",
    "the interactions between beads that were not bonded within the oligomeric chain were determined by a truncated harmonic potential : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the spring constant of the potential and @xmath88 is the cut off radius of the potential . without excluded volume interactions , an attractive",
    "potential tends to cause the chain to favor a collapsed configuration .",
    "this constraint coupled with the need for a clean cut - off potential led to its selection .",
    "the interactions between the walls and the oligomer were modeled using an exponential repulsive potential : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is distance between the particle and the nearest point on the wall , @xmath91 is the maximum potential between bead @xmath60 and the wall , @xmath92 is the decay constant of the potential and @xmath93 is the cut off radius of the potential .",
    "this potential was chosen to prevent the oligomer from adsorbing to the wall of the channel .",

    "this section has presented the simulation models and physical parameters , this section will discuss the physical significance of these choices .",
    "the fluid velocity profile is governed by four dimensionless numbers , the knudsen number , @xmath106 , the reynolds number , @xmath107 , the mach number , @xmath108 and the prandtl number @xmath109 .",
    "the first three of these numbers are related to each other through the equation , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the knudsen number is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the characteristic length scale of the system@xcite .",
    "in essence it indicates whether the inter - particle distance is significant over the range that hydrodynamic parameters vary significantly .",
    "if @xmath114 then a continuum method such as the navier - stokes equation can be used to model the flow profile , while a large @xmath106 ( @xmath115 ) indicates that a molecular dynamics approach is more appropriate to simulate the dynamics of the system . in the simulations with flow presented here , the knudsen number ranged from @xmath116 to @xmath117 in spatial regions in the channel that are far from the polymer . in the vicinity of the polymer",
    ", local thermodynamic and transport properties are not well - defined due to rapid changes in the microscopic definition of such quantities over molecular length scales .",
    "the mach number is the ratio of the speed of the fluid to the speed of sound in the fluid , and is defined for a gas as @xmath118 .",
    "a low mach number indicates that compressibility effects of the fluid can be ignored . for the present simulations , the mach number ranged from @xmath63 to @xmath119 , indicating that the compressibility effects of the fluid can not be universally ignored .",
    "the reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces , and for a square channel it is defined as @xmath120 . at high reynolds numbers ( @xmath121 for pipe flow@xcite ) , turbulence begins to emerge in the flow . over the course of the simulations , the reynolds number ranged from @xmath63 to @xmath122 , indicating laminar flow .",
    "finally , the prandtl number represents the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity , and is defined as @xmath123 . in the simulations analyzed here , the prandtl number had a value of @xmath124 , indicating that convective mass transfer was dominant over conductive mass transfer .    in the presence of a grafted polymer ,",
    "another dimensionless number becomes relevant , the schmidt number .",
    "this number indicates the relative strength of convective mass transfer processes to diffusive mass transfer processes and also indicates whether hydrodynamic interactions are gas - like or liquid - like .",
    "the schmidt number , defined as @xmath125 , was computed to have a value of @xmath126 , indicating a gas - like solvent .",
    "as the flow profile includes the pressure drop in the fluid and the srd fluid described here has an ideal gas equation of state , a gas - like fluid should be simulated instead of a liquid - like fluid where the compressibility is negligible .",
    "the diffusion coefficient for the center of mass of the polymer , @xmath127 , can be written as @xcite , @xmath128 where @xmath129 @xmath130 is the average number of polymer beads per cell and @xmath131 is the mass of a polymer bead .",
    "the ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the fluid to the diffusion coefficient of the polymer , @xmath132 indicating that the center of mass of an unattached polymer diffuses significantly more slowly than the fluid corresponding to the conditions relevant for brownian dynamics of polymer as a whole .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the self - diffusion coefficients of the fluid and polymer bead particles , @xmath133 , can be estimated@xcite to be around @xmath134 , which suggests that the polymer beads themselves move more rapidly than the surrounding fluid particles due to their small mass . under these solvent conditions ,",
    "the dynamics of the polymer beads is not brownian - like due to the small size and mass of the individual monomers in the oligomer .",
    "the initial response of the oligomer from its initial stretched configuration to the fluid is dependent on two effects , an initial entropic retraction of the chain towards the anchor point as the oligomer attempts to assume a random coil configuration , and the drag force of the flow field pulling the chain in the direction of flow . at low flow rates ,",
    "the entropic retraction is dominant and the oligomer adopts a random coil configuration . as the flow rate",
    "is increased , the oligomer initially assumes a parabolic arc that matches the velocity profile of the channel .",
    "then , as the tension in the chain increases , the oligomer straightens and rotates until it lies recumbent near the wall of the channel .",
    "this manifests as a general increase in @xmath135 , more specifically an increase in the flow component , @xmath79 , and a decrease in the other two components , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows @xmath135 and its three components as a function of the shear rate at the adhesion point of the oligomer to the channel .",
    "there appears to be a minimum velocity below which the oligomer does not extend in the direction of flow , and above this velocity the oligomer rapidly extends to a value that is approximately @xmath136 of its contour length .",
    "because there are no explicit attractive interactions between beads in the chain , there is no impetus for adopting a specific conformation and the loss of conformational entropy from extension should be the primary resistance against oligomer elongation .",
    "the entropic resistance of a material to physical deformation is the basis of the entropic theory of rubber elasticity . extrapolating this theory to a single chain",
    ", the relationship between the shear rate , @xmath137 , and the elongation ratio of the oligomer , @xmath138 , should be @xcite , @xmath139 as the @xmath140 term vanishes very rapidly for large elongation ratios , one expects essentially a linear relationship between the elongation ratio and the shear rate .",
    "however the shear force is not the only force acting on the oligomer , as the flow field has an additional contribution from the slip velocity . at low flow rates , a greater than linear increase in the flow rate",
    "is expected . at higher flow rates , the oligomer reaches its elastic limit as bond stretching forces become dominant .",
    "thus a sigmoidal relationship between the radius of gyration and the shear rate is expected and confirmed by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .     and its three components vs. wall shear rate at the point of adhesion ( 0 , 10 l , 50 l ) .",
    "]    visualizations of the oligomer trajectory revealed that there appeared to be two time scales of motion for the oligomeric chain ; a fast primarily torsional mode of motion along the length of the chain that produces little effect on the radius of gyration and a slower bulk movement of the chain that creates larger fluctuations in the radius of gyration .",
    "the faster mode manifests as finer noise in the data and appears to be periodic , as can be seen in the cross - correlation function of velocity components in the direction normal to the direction of flow computed via the equation @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the length of the simulation , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the time averaged values of velocity components @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the standard deviations of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "periodic oscillations within the @xmath149 plane will be evident as a sinusoidal wave within this function .",
