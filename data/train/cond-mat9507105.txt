    "even though `` noise '' usually represents unwanted fluctuations which blur information , noise is on the fundamental level closely connected with the dynamics of a system and it contains variety of information .    in this context , there have been many recent studies on a noise spectrum of current in small devices . in ballistic systems ,",

    "it was pointed that electron - electron interaction effect becomes important for small devices .",
    "for example , it was argued that a tunnel junction develops tunneling gap in current - voltage characteristic when the temperature is lower than the charging energy of a junction @xmath3 @xcite .    the charging energy was predicted to affect noise spectrum as well .",

    "eq.([eqn : sir ] ) makes one interesting prediction in the low impedance ohmic environment . as illustrated in sec.[subsec : low ] ( fig.[fig : excess](a ) ) , the excess noise measured from the environment is different from the tunneling excess noise and follows eq.([eqn : suppression ] ) .",
    "recently , there was an experiment which measured the excess noise of the quantum point contact in the low impedance environment@xcite .",
    "the voltage bias @xmath162 of the order of @xmath163mv was applied and the excess noise was measured at frequency @xmath164ghz which is much lower than the voltage @xmath165 .",
    "the frequency was chosen to avoid complications due to other noise sources at low frequency such as @xmath166 noise .",
    "the measured excess noise was compared with theoretical calculations of the noise power(for example , ref.@xcite or @xmath167 ) based on the assumption that the non - zero frequency excess noise is essentially the same as the noise power if @xmath165 .",
    "the experiment showed nice agreement with existing theories in ballistic regime .",
    "however in the pinched off regime which corresponds to the weak tunneling limit , it was found that the noise was reduced to about @xmath0 of theoretical predictions .",
    "the quantum point contact in ref.@xcite is induced electrostatistically in the plane of a 2deg embedded in gaas - algaas heterostructure . due to the very different density of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors ,",
    "our calculation on metallic junctions can not be directly applied to analyze the experiment .",
    "however we believe that the difference of @xmath168 and @xmath169 in the low impedance environment is a generic property of the weak tunneling limit because the difference originates from the finite relaxation time of the environment which does not depend on charge carrier density .",
    "we argue that the noise suppression observed in ref.@xcite may have its origin in the different frequency dependence of the relaxed and tunneling excess noise as illustrated in sec.[subsec : low ] .",
    "however , we are unable to establish quantitative agreement of the experiment with eq.([eqn : suppression ] ) because the precise values of @xmath61 and @xmath129 are not available .",
    "more experiment on , for example , the frequency dependence of the suppression factor , is needed .",
    "eq.([eqn : sir ] ) makes another interesting prediction in the high impedance ohmic environment . at frequency @xmath152 , the spectral density @xmath103 measured at the leads _ decreases _ below its equilibrium value when the voltage bias is applied(sec.[subsec : high ] ) , making the relaxed excess noise negative .",
    "usually the spectral density increases when the voltage bias is applied .",
    "therefore the observation of the negative excess noise can serve as a crucial test of the present calculation .",
    "calculation in this paper is restricted to the weak tunneling limit @xmath170 .",
    "it will be interesting to carry out similar study for the weak scattering limit . according to a recent experiment on quantum point contact@xcite ,",
    "the measured excess noises show the deviation from existing theories only in the pinched off regime and as a channel opens(as a transmission coefficient @xmath101 approaches @xmath163 ) , the deviation disappears .",
    "if the deviation is due to the difference between the relaxed excess noise and the tunneling excess noise , the experiment implies that the junction in the weak scattering limit no longer behaves as a conventional capacitor and the difference between the two excess noise vanishes .",
    "though the experiment used junctions in semiconducting heterostructure , we expect metallic junctions show similar behavior at least in the low impedance environment .",
    "also there was a theoretical study of a single tunnel junction using the functional integral technique@xcite .",
    "it was claimed that the junction becomes purely ohmic and the capacitive effect vanishes in the weak scattering limit .    in the weak scattering limit",
    ", electron transport is continuous rather than being sporadic as in the weak tunneling limit and we do nt expect a conventional capacitor is a proper description of the junction .",
    "however , further study is required to gain the quantitative understanding in the weak scattering limit .",
    "in summary , we considered current transport through a junction connected to electromagnetic environment in the weak tunneling limit . the charging energy",
    "is taken into account to incorporate the electron - electron interaction effect .",
    "we calculated both the tunneling noise and the relaxed noise for arbitrary environment and showed their dependence on the charging energy and environment .",
    "we found that contrary to conventional expectation , the current through the potential barrier of the junction and the current measured from the environment have different excess noise . in the low impedance environment",
    ", the difference is due to the finite relaxation time of the junction . in the high impedance environment",
    ", additional complication occurs and at frequency @xmath171 , the spectral density of the relaxed current decreases below the equilibrium level when small voltage bias is applied .",
