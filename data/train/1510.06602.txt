    "our goal is to construct asymptotic formula for jacobi elliptic function @xmath0 , when @xmath1 , which is uniform for all period of the function . the asymptotic expansions for the elliptic functions , when @xmath1 , are given in numerous handbooks ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "however that expansions not are uniform for very large @xmath2 , when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a period of the function .",
    "an obstacle for the uniformity of the expansions is the special behaviours of the elliptic functions in neighbourhoods of the turning points @xmath5 and far from them .",
    "let us consider an equation @xmath6 with an initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the solution of this cauchy problem is the jacobi elliptic function : @xmath8 the handbook gives the following approximation ( see @xcite , formula 16.15.1 ) : @xmath9      this approximation is non - periodic , but @xmath10 is periodic function with formula for the period : @xmath11 the integral in the right - hand side of the formula is the elliptic integral of the first kind , which is typically denoted by @xmath12 . the handbook @xcite gives an polynomial approximation of the integral ( formula ( 17.3.34 ) ) : @xmath13    in this work we clarify the formula for asymptotic of the elliptic integral of first order and obtain an asymptotic an uniform asymptotic approximation for @xmath14 . due to the symmetry",
    "@xmath15 the asymptotic approximation is sufficiently for a half of the period .",
    "let us consider the integral as a sum of two integrals over two intervals from zero to small neighbour of @xmath18 and over small neighbourhood of @xmath19 : @xmath20 denote @xmath21 then @xmath22 now it is convenient to expand the first multiplier into series of @xmath23 : @xmath24 next step is a substitution of this expansion into integral for @xmath25 . now the integral should be represented as a sum of integrals .",
    "these integrals are obviously calculated by computer algebra system , such as maxima @xcite .",
    "for example : @xmath26 similar formulas are obtained for the next integrals : @xmath27 here @xmath28 . as a result one",
    "obtain : @xmath29 this formula in the terms of @xmath16 has the following form : @xmath30    the similar formula in the numeric form : @xmath31 the differences between ( [ numericofellipticintegraloffirstkind ] ) and ( [ numericapproximationfromabramowitzstegun ] ) can be explained by the different kind of these formulas .",
    "the formula ( [ numericofellipticintegraloffirstkind ] ) is asymptotic , but ( [ numericapproximationfromabramowitzstegun ] ) is numerical approximation by polynomials of the value for numerical calculated of the elliptic integral .",
    "equations of the high - order terms can be obtained after substituting of ( [ asymptoticsclosetoseparatrix ] ) into ( [ eqsnjacobi ] ) and collecting coefficients of @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "these equations are combined into a recurrent system .",
    "the equations for the high - order terms have solutions in the form : @xmath42 particularly for @xmath43 one obtains : @xmath44 it yields : @xmath45 the equation for @xmath46 : @xmath47 it yields : @xmath48 the high - order terms can be obtained by the same way using ( [ eqsnjacobiun ] ) . in particular for @xmath39-th order term one obtains : @xmath49    obvious form of the solutions are very large . here the asymptotic behaviour as @xmath50 are more important : @xmath51 then the interval of validity for the constructed expansion is : @xmath52 as a result we get that the asymptotic expansion of the elliptic functions is valid when @xmath53 .",
    "the elliptic function @xmath54 has an asymptotic behaviour of another type near the turning points .",
    "here we constructs the asymptotic expansion for the @xmath54 near the saddle - point @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 here @xmath63 .",
    "the equations for the coefficients of the expansion can be obtained by ordinary way .",
    "one should collect terms with the similar order of @xmath16 . as a result one obtains a recurrent system of equations : @xmath64 here",
    "@xmath65 is a polynomial of four power with @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .    .",
    "the asymptotic curve and function @xmath68 when @xmath69 .",
    "the turning point not coincides with @xmath70 , because for @xmath57 used only primary term of period for the elliptic function and not used the shift term @xmath71 . ]",
    "the validity of this expansion is defined by the condition : @xmath79 using estimates for the grows of the terms one obtains : @xmath80 the intervals of validity for ( [ asymptoticsclosetoseparatrix ] ) are intersect when @xmath81 and @xmath58 . in the intersected field",
    "one can match the parameters of the asymptotic expansions .",
    "here we choose the parameters @xmath78 of the terms @xmath82 . in particular , the matching gives @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now we are ready to construct a combined approximation of the function @xmath86 , which will be uniform over more than a half of the period @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "to this we use an asymptotic device which was offered by s.kaplun @xcite for combined approximations .",
    "we sum the constructed asymptotic expansions and subtract their common part . as a result",
    "we obtain the following formula ( see figure [ fig - sn - matching - asymptotics-1 ] ) : @xmath89    in the neighbourhood of the left saddle - point @xmath90 , @xmath91 we can construct the same asymptotic expansion .",
    "but it is easy to get the formula @xmath92 and the asymptotic expansion will be obtained automatically way using the asymptotic expansion ( [ jacobi - sn - asymptotics-1 ] ) ( see figure [ fig - sn - matching - asymptotics-2 ] ) .",
    "the combined asymptotic approximation which is valid over all period of the elliptic function can be constructed by the same way , using the formulas ( [ jacobi - sn - asymptotics-1 ] ) and ( [ jacobi - sn - asymptotics-2 ] ) for the sum and subtract their common parts .",
    "but such combined asymptotic formula is large and does not written here .",
