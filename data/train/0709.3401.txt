    "the proof of large deviations for the distribution of the particle density ( the kac distribution ) in the perfect and in the mean - field bose gases goes back to @xcite . in recent papers @xcite",
    ", the authors addressed to the large deviations in the particle density in a sub - domain both for the perfect and for rarified quantum gases ( fermi or bose ) . in the present paper",
    "we extend the study of large deviations ( ld ) principle to the superstable weakly imperfect bose gas ( wibg ) @xcite , known also as the superstable bogoliubov model @xcite .",
    "the study of this model started in @xcite was recently completed in @xcite .",
    "actually , this model originates from a _ weaker truncation _ than that of the bogoliubov one in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "this new system served to solve some inconsistencies between the grand - canonical bogoliubov theory of superfluidity and the wibg description .",
    "this non - diagonal boson model was rigorously solved on the thermodynamic level for the grand - canonical ensemble in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that similar to the wibg it manifests a phase transition with a _ non - conventional _ bose condensation at high densities @xmath2 or high inverse temperatures @xmath3 .",
    "meantime , even for @xmath4 i.e. at a zero - temperature , only a fraction of the full density is in the condensate : i.e. there is a _ coexistence _ of particles inside and outside the boson condensate . this last phenomenon is known as _ depletion _ of the condensate .",
    "more interesting for our analysis is a discontinuity of the particle density from @xmath5 to @xmath6 related to a strictly positive jump of the condensate density at the phase transition defined by a fixed chemical potential @xmath7 this _ first - order _ phase transition as a function of the chemical potential @xmath8 sounds unusual and seems to be not quite clear as far as it concerns its physical relevance .",
    "in fact , the grand - canonical thermodynamics of the superstable wibg is _ unknown _ at the point of coexistence of the low- and high - density phases .",
    "this paper proposes to close this gap using large deviations techniques description of the density distribution .",
    "for instance to answer the question , what is the value of the bose condensate density when @xmath9 $ ] ?",
    "in fact several scenarios are possible .",
    "since this phase transition is characterized by the appearance of a non - conventional bose condensation , which is due to particle interaction , a naive thought might be that there is no condensate at all in domain @xmath10 , i.e. the condensate density jumps from zero to a strictly positive value for @xmath11 .",
    "in fact this scenario is _",
    "wrong_. here we show that this discontinuity is a subtle function of the total particle density @xmath2 .",
    "formally , at the point of the phase coexistence , the corresponding quantum gibbs state of the model is no more a pure state @xcite but instead , a convex combination of some of them .",
    "a similar observation was made for example in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "actually , we verify ld for the bose condensate density for any given particle densities @xmath2 in the grand - canonical ensemble , i.e. even at the point of the phase transition . a direct consequence of this study is a rigorous proof that the discontinuity of the bose condensate and its depletion , visible as a function of the chemical potential @xmath8 , does not appear in the same grand - canonical ensemble if it is considered as a function of the total particle density @xmath12 .",
    "we show that the bose condensate density continuously increases with @xmath12 . in others",
    "words , there is no jump and the phase transition in @xmath12 is of the second order . when the particle density @xmath2 ( or the inverse temperature @xmath3 ) exceeds the first critical value @xmath13 , the bose condensate density continuously grows but the free - energy per particle , i.e. , the corresponding chemical potential @xmath14 stays constant : @xmath15 in domain : @xmath16 $ ] . at higher particle densities ( or inverse temperatures @xmath3 ) , the bose condensate as well as the free - energy per particle @xmath17 both increase when @xmath11 .",

    "the proofs are collected in section [ proof ] . for the reader convenience ,",
