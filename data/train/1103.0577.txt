    "localization of waves in a disordered medium was first predicted by anderson @xcite in the context of non - interacting electrons in a random crystal .",
    "recently , developments in the research into ultracold atomic gases have enlarged the possibilities for studying anderson localization in new systems . a breakthrough in the area was the experimental realization of anderson localization of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in two different kinds of disordered optical potentials @xcite : billy _ _ et al.__@xcite employed a bec of @xmath0rb atoms in the presence of a controlled disorder produced by a laser speckle , while roati _ et al . _",
    "@xcite utilized a bec of essentially non - interacting @xmath1k atoms in combination with a one - dimensional quasi - periodic lattice to observe anderson localization .",
    "subsequently , this issue has been attracting increasing interest from both the experimental and theoretical communities . from the experimental point of view",
    ", a variety of techniques have been implemented , such as bichromatic optical lattices @xcite , speckle laser patterns @xcite , and disordered cold atom lattices @xcite .",
    "theoretically , different approaches such as a variational method @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite , exact diagonalization @xcite , renormalization group @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , mean - field approximations @xcite , and a perturbative treatment @xcite , among others , have been explored in this context of disordered ultracold atoms .",
    "the usual model for bosons on a lattice utilizes the so - called bose - hubbard hamiltonian , with the general form @xmath2 with the standard notation for creation , annihilation , and number operators for bosons at lattice sites .",
    "each site is considered to have a single bound state of energy @xmath3 , the hopping between sites is restricted to nearest neighbors , with amplitude @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a local repulsive interaction .",
    "randomness is introduced via the values of @xmath3 .",
    "these values can have a truly random ( usually uniform ) distribution in the range @xmath6 , which characterizes the anderson model @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they can vary periodically with a period incommensurate with the lattice spacing .",
    "this is the case in the aubry - andr ( aa ) model @xcite for which the energies , in the one - dimensional case , are written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the golden ratio , and @xmath9 assumes integer values from 1 to @xmath10 ( the system size in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "experimentally , speckle patterns can be modeled by the anderson model , while quasi - periodic potentials can be described by the aa model .",
    "the phenomenology of model ( [ ham ] ) at low temperatures involves bose - einstein condensation , superfluidity , a mott ( gapped ) phase , and anderson localization , depending on the relative values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of such a rich phenomenology are faced with the usual challenges of interacting many - body problems .",
    "for arbitrary interaction strengths perturbation theory can not be used , which more or less restricts the approach to numerical solutions on finite - size lattices . then",
    ", finite - size effects tend to smear out the sharp phase boundaries expected in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is true even for the pure anderson transition in the non - interacting limit .",
    "for instance , in his original paper @xcite anderson proved that his model presents localization for any @xmath12 in one dimension , while aubry and andr @xcite proved that in their model localization only occurs for @xmath13 , but these critical values are not clearly seen in small lattices .",
    "our aim in this paper is to discuss in detail the effects of finite size in the non - interacting limit for a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "we focus on the size dependence of quantities that provide signatures of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , here applied to anderson localization .",
    "in addition to the superfluid fraction , common in studies of bose - einstein condensates , we also employ quantities borrowed from quantum information theory , like entanglement and fidelity @xcite .",
    "all of these quantities allow us to obtain the correct thermodynamic limit of the critical disorder strength for both anderson and aubry - andr models .",
    "in particular , we are able to show that the critical disorder strength in the anderson model obeys a scaling law with the system size .",
    "we consider one - dimensional lattices of @xmath10 sites , and perform exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix , obtaining a chosen number of lowest - energy eigenvalues , and the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "we will focus only on ground - state results . since interaction is not taken into account here",
    ", we restrict our numerical calculations to a single particle .",
    "when evaluating the quantities of interest for the anderson model , it is necessary to average over a large number of random configurations of the local energies in order to have physically meaningful results .    for each lattice size",
    ", we calculate the superfluid fraction , ground - state entanglement and fidelity , as discussed in detail below .",
    "this is done for a wide range of disorder strength values , with the aim of determining a critical value above which the states are localized . throughout the paper , energy quantities ( like @xmath11 )",
    "are measured in units of the tunneling amplitude @xmath4 , while the lattice size @xmath10 is expressed in units of the lattice spacing , which is equivalent to the number of sites .",
    "the ground state of a uniform bose - einstein condensate should be superfluid .",
    "there is some controversy as to whether this remains true in the non - interacting limit . as discussed by lieb _ _ et al.__@xcite , if one defines a superfluid as a fluid that does not respond to an external velocity field ( e.g. , rotation of the container walls ) , then the ideal bose gas is a perfect superfluid in its ground state .",
    "this is the approach we adopt here . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of disorder tends to alter the nature of the quantum states , which become no longer extended over the entire system , but localized over a finite distance .",
    "then , the so called _ superfluid fraction _ ( here denoted by @xmath14 ) can signal whether the states are extended ( @xmath15 ) or not ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the superfluid fraction for a discrete lattice system is proportional to the difference in ground - state energy between the systems with periodic and with twisted boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "instead , we may keep periodic boundary conditions and use a twisted hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the twist angle .",
    "ground - state energies of the hamiltonian ( [ twist ] ) are calculated for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) as well as for finite @xmath18 ( @xmath21 ) , and the superfluid fraction is given by @xcite @xmath22 being independent of the twist angle @xmath18 as long as @xmath23 . in practice , @xmath14 remains the same even for twist angles that are a significant fraction of @xmath24 .",
    "typically , we use @xmath25 in our numerical calculations .     for different lattice sizes .",
    "the averages were calculated from 5000 random configurations of the potential .",

    "we have @xmath28 , and the ground - state is localized .",
    "we define a characteristic value @xmath29 of the disorder strength for each lattice size by observing that the superfluid - fraction curves are well fitted by the function @xmath30 for all lattice sizes @xmath10 we find that the fitting parameter @xmath31 has approximately the same value @xmath32 .",

    "[ fig : sfaa ] .",
    "the reason for this apparently puzzling feature lies in the mismatching between periodic boundary conditions with integer period @xmath10 and the aubry - andr potential with irrational period @xmath40 .",
    "one can verify that @xmath39 occurs when @xmath10 belongs to the sequence of fibonacci numbers @xcite .",

    "the ratio between two consecutive fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio when these numbers become very large . for small",
    "lattice sizes it is better to redefine the parameter @xmath42 to be such a ratio of fibonacci numbers .",
    "we do this in order to get better results for smaller sizes like @xmath43 or 13 , which become relevant for numerical solutions in the presence of interactions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that departure from the critical @xmath35 was observed in the experiments of roati _ et al .",
    "they find localization for @xmath44 , using an incommensurate potential with @xmath45 .",
    "this value of @xmath42 , being significantly different from a ratio of consecutive fibonacci numbers ( the golden ratio is @xmath46 ) , does not ensure the duality condition @xcite that yields @xmath35 .       for different lattice sizes in the anderson model .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] , we see that in all the three cases ( superfluid fraction , entanglement , and fidelity ) the following scaling law is obeyed : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive real numbers , and @xmath78 is the critical disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit . despite the fact that the prefactor @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) differs for the three definitions of @xmath29 , we find the same exponent @xmath79 in all three cases , and the results are consistent with @xmath73 , in accordance with the exact value for anderson localization in one dimension .",

    "we presented a detailed numerical study of disorder - induced localization in the one - dimensional anderson and aubry - andr models of bose - einstein condensates . through exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix",
    ", we studied the superfluid fraction , entanglement , and fidelity as quantities that can signal the localization transition even at finite size .",
    "here we restricted our analysis to the non - interacting limit in order to reach large lattice sizes . with this , we were able to verify that finite - size - scaling laws are obeyed by all the studied quantities in the case of the anderson model , with a common exponent . in contrast , finite - size effects in the aubry - andr model are less pronounced , and mainly related to the incommensurability between the potential and the system size . if the incommensurate potential is tuned so that an integer number of periods nearly coincides with the system size , then the localization transition is fairly sharp at the critical potential strength .",
    "even though all the three quantities analyzed here show clear signatures of the localization transition , we find that the fidelity is less prone to finite - size effects .",
