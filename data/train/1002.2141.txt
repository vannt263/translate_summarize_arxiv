    "during the last few decades possible existence of yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravitational law has attracted considerable attention @xcite . in the middle of eighties the problem of the so - called _ fifth force _ was widely discussed .",
    "finally , no deviations from the predictions of newtonian gravity have been found .",
    "however , after some period of time interest in hypothetical corrections to newton s law at short separations was rekindled by numerous predictions of high energy physics beyond the standard model . on the one hand , many unification schemes predicted the existence of massless and light bosons such as arion @xcite , scalar axion @xcite , graviphoton @xcite , dilaton @xcite , goldstino @xcite , moduli @xcite , etc .",
    "the exchange of light bosons between two atoms belonging to different macrobodies generates an effective yukawa - type force at short range depending on the mass of the particle . on the other hand , the yukawa - type correction to newton",
    "s law at submillimeter separations was predicted by multidimensional unification schemes , where additional spatial dimensions are compactified at relatively low energy of the order of 1tev @xcite . in such schemes , at separations much larger than the size of a compact manifold",
    ", the gravitational potential is given by the sum of newton s and yukawa - type terms @xcite .",
    "keeping in mind that at separations below @xmath2 m the newton s law was poorly tested experimentally , the above theoretical predictions generated considerable public excitement .",
    "the key question is whether the yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity exist in nature and , if they do , how strong they are and what is their interaction range .",
    "the strongest constraints on the parameters of these corrections in the interaction range larger than @xmath3 m were obtained from the etvos @xcite and cavendish - type @xcite experiments . at shorter interaction range , however , the gravitational experiments do not lead to competitive constraints because the gravitational force becomes too weak . as to very short separations ,",
    "the hypothetical interactions of yukawa - type should be considered in a background of the van der waals and casimir forces .    the possibility of obtaining constraints on the predicted forces of yukawa and power - type from the measurements of the casimir force was predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the casimir force originates from zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "it acts at separations of the order of @xmath4 m between the surfaces of uncharged material bodies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent overview on the subject ) .",
    "the modern stage in the measurement of the casimir force has begun in 1997 and has resulted in more than twenty experiments ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "many of them were used to obtain constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type interactions in the interaction range from a few nanometers to a few micrometers . in the torsion pendulum experiment @xcite the constraints",
    "were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite ; in the experiments using an atomic force microscope @xcite the respective constraints were found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and in the experiment with two crossed cylinders @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all these experiments",
    "the casimir force acting in normal direction to the surfaces of a sphere and a plate or two cylinders has been measured . as to the three dynamic experiments using a micromachined oscillator @xcite ,",
    "the gradient of the normal casimir force acting between a sphere and a plate was measured . in the proximity force approximation ( pfa )",
    "this gradient is proportional to the casimir pressure in the configuration of two parallel plates . because of this",
    ", the respective constraints were obtained on the yukawa - type pressure , rather than on the yukawa - type force @xcite .    as is evident from the foregoing",
    ", the strongest constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity at separations above a few micrometers are obtained from gravitational experiments . within a wide interaction range from a few nanometers to a few micrometers ,",
    "the strongest constraints follow from the measurement of the casimir force .",
    "notice that the first constraints on the yukawa - type hypothetical interaction obtained from the casimir effect @xcite were not as exact and reliable as the constraints obtained from the gravitational experiments at larger separations @xcite . specifically , for constraints of casimir origin the confidence levels were not determined .",
    "this is due to some difficulties in the comparison between experiment and theory when the measured force is a strongly nonlinear function of separation .",
    "later , however , the use of appropriate statistical methods @xcite allowed to obtain from the casimir effect the constraints of the same degree of reliability @xcite as from the gravitational experiments .",
    "in addition , the previously performed measurement of the casimir force @xcite was reanalyzed @xcite and respective constraints valid at a 95% confidence level were obtained @xcite .",
    "they are slightly weaker than those in ref .",
    "@xcite , but benefit from high confidence .",
    "it is pertinent to note that a widely debated topic on the thermal contribution to the casimir force @xcite is irrelevant to constraining the hypothetical forces of yukawa - type from the casimir effect because the difference between the alternative thermal corrections considered in the literature can not be modeled by the yukawa potential . as a result ,",
    "the measurements of the casimir force have helped to strengthen the previously known constraints on the yukawa interaction in the submicrometer range up to ten thousand times .    in this paper",
    "we obtain stronger constraints on the hypothetical interaction of yukawa - type from recent measurement of the lateral casimir force between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate @xcite .",
    "as compared with the previously known constraints in the interaction range below 14 nm obtained at the same high confidence ( a 95% confidence level ) , a strengthening up to a factor of @xmath0 is achieved .",
    "we also discuss respective limits on the parameters of hypothetical light elementary particles .",
    "the use of corrugated surfaces opens new prospective opportunities for constraining the yukawa - type hypothetical interactions from the casimir effect . in view of this fact in the present paper",
    "we propose several experiments of this type and calculate the strength of constraints that can be obtained in future in different interaction ranges .",
    "specifically we consider the measurement of the normal casimir force acting between a smooth sphere and a sinusoidally corrugated plate .",
    "we also explore the potentials of dynamic experiments where the separation distance between the test bodies is varied harmonically and the measured quantities are the gradients of the casimir force @xcite ( casimir - polder force @xcite ) , or of the casimir pressure @xcite .",

    "it is customary to normalize the yukawa interaction potential between two neutral point masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( atoms ) at a separation @xmath7 to the potential of newtonian gravity and represent it in the form @xcite @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the newtonian gravitational constant , @xmath10 is a dimensionless constant characterizing the strength of the yukawa interaction and @xmath11 is its interaction range .",

    "the lateral casimir force acting between the sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate was first experimentally demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a measure of agreement between the data and the theoretically calculated lateral casimir force was used to obtain constraints on the parameters of yukawa interaction , namely , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this , however , did not lead to definitive constraints determined at a high confidence level because the determination of the lateral casimir force between corrugated surfaces was not sufficiently precise .    in a recent experiment @xcite the lateral casimir force",
    "was measured between two aligned sinusoidally corrugated surfaces of a grating and a sphere with equal corrugation periods @xmath14 nm and corrugation amplitudes @xmath15 nm and @xmath16 nm , respectively .",
    "the grating was made of hard epoxy with density @xmath17 on a 3 mm thick pyrex substrate .",
    "the top of the grating was covered with a @xmath18 nm thick au coating of density @xmath19 .",
    "the sphere of @xmath20 m radius was made of polystyrene of density @xmath21 and uniformly coated with a @xmath22 nm layer of cr ( @xmath23 ) and then with a @xmath24 nm layer of au in a thermal evaporator @xcite .",
    "the lateral casimir force was independently ( without fit to any theory ) measured as a function of the phase shift @xmath25 between corrugations on the sphere and on the grating over the region of separations , @xmath26 , in the range from 120 to 190 nm . at each separation",
    "@xmath27 the maximum magnitude of the lateral casimir force was achieved at some phase shift @xmath28 ( keeping in mind that the dependence of the lateral force on @xmath25 is not strictly sinusoidal , @xmath28 must not be multiples of @xmath29 ) .",
    "the absolute errors , @xmath30 , of the measured maximum magnitudes of the lateral casimir force at different separations were determined at a 95% confidence level .",
    "the measurement data were compared with the exact theory taking into account a nonzero skin depth of the au coating and treating the casimir force due to the nontrivial geometry of sinusoidally corrugated surfaces in the framework of the rayleigh scattering approach .",
    "it was found that the experimental data agree with the theory within the limits of the experimental errors @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the magnitudes of any possible lateral yukawa - type force that might arise between the corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a grating must satisfy the inequality @xmath31 with @xmath30 as defined above .",
    "equation ( [ eq2 ] ) follows from the fact that the measured force consisting of the lateral casimir force and possible lateral yukawa - type force agrees with the theoretical lateral casimir force to within the experimental error of the force measurement ( note that in the experiment under consideration the experimental errors @xmath30 are much larger than the errors in computations of the lateral casimir force with the help of the scattering approach ) .",
    "now we need to calculate the effect of aligned corrugations on the yukawa - type energy ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this can be done by using the method of geometrical averaging @xcite , i.e. , by replacing the closest separation @xmath26 between the smooth surfaces in eq .",

    "the normal casimir forces acting between a smooth sphere and a corrugated plate with sinusoidal @xcite and rectangular @xcite corrugations have been measured . however , due to the absence of sufficiently exact theory of the casimir force applicable to corrugated surfaces at that time , it was not possible to investigate the strength of constraints which might be imposed using the results of these measurements .",
    "presently the exact theory of the casimir force applicable to corrugated surfaces of test bodies made of real materials , at the laboratory temperature , is available @xcite . because of this , it is pertinent to verify the potentialities of different configurations with corrugated surfaces for the strengthening of constraints on the yukawa - type interaction . in this section",

    "we obtain constraints on the parameters of the yukawa - type interaction using the measurement data of dynamic experiment demonstrating the thermal casimir - polder force between @xmath122rb atoms and a sio@xmath123 plate @xcite .",
    "rubidium atoms belonged to a bose - einstein condensate which was produced in a magnetic trap with frequencies equal to @xmath124rad / s and @xmath125rad / s in the perpendicular and longitudinal directions to the plate , respectively .",
    "this resulted in thomas - fermi radii @xmath126 m and @xmath127 m , respectively .",
    "an oscillation amplitude @xmath128 m in the @xmath33 direction was chosen and was kept constant . by illuminating the plate with laser pulses it was possible to vary its temperature . during measurements of the casimir - polder force ,",
    "the separation distance between the cloud of @xmath122rb atoms and the plate was varied in the range from 7 to @xmath129 m . due to the influence of the casimir - polder force , the oscillation frequency in the @xmath33 direction shifted , and the relative frequency shift @xmath130 was measured as the function of the separation @xmath26 between the plate and the center of mass of the condensate .",
    "the absolute errors in the measurement of @xmath131 at different separations @xmath27 , @xmath132 , were found in ref .",
    "@xcite at a 67% confidence level .",
    "the yukawa - type interaction ( if any ) would also lead to some frequency shift in the perpendicular direction to the plate .",
    "it can be calculated in the following way .",
    "the yukawa energy of a single atom of mass @xmath5 above a thick plate can be found by the integration of the potential ( [ eq1 ] ) over the volume of the plate @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the density of plate material ( fused silica ) . from this",
    "the yukawa - type force acting on an atom is given by @xmath135 the frequency shift due to the yukawa force ( [ eq26 ] ) can be calculated by averaging over the deviations of separate atoms in the @xmath33-direction from the center of mass of a condensate , which is taken at the origin of the @xmath33 axis , and over the oscillation period @xcite @xmath136 . \\label{eq27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the distribution function of the atomic gas density is given by @xmath137 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) into eq .",

    "( [ eq30 ] ) .",
    "the computational results are presented by the solid line in fig .",
    "5 . within the interaction range",
    "@xmath142 m the best constraints given by the solid line were obtained in an equilibrium situation when the temperatures of the plate and of the environment are equal to 310k . in so doing the magnitude of the absolute error @xmath143 was used which occurs at the separation distance @xmath144 m @xcite . within the interaction range",
    "@xmath145 m the best constraints are also obtained in an equilibrium situation . here , the measurement at the separation @xmath146 m was used with the respective absolute error equal to @xmath147 @xcite . in an intermediate interaction range of @xmath11 from 2 to @xmath148 m the best constraints follow from out of equilibrium measurement data , where the temperature of an environment was the same as before , but the temperature of the plate was equal to 479k .",
    "the best constraints were found from the measurement performed at @xmath149 m with @xmath150 @xcite .    for comparison purposes , the long - dashed line in fig .",
    "5 shows the constraints obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the torsion pendulum experiment of ref .",
    "it is seen that constraints obtained from the torsion pendulum experiment are from about one to two orders of magnitude stronger ( depending on the interaction range ) than the constraints given by the solid line .",
    "it is important to bear in mind , however , that the constraints from the measurement of the casimir - polder force ( the solid line ) were determined at a 67% confidence level , whereas the confidence level of constraints given by the long - dashed line can not be determined .",
    "this is caused by some uncertain features of the experiment @xcite discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the short - dashed line in fig .",
    "5 presents the strongest constraints in this interaction range following from gravitational experiments .",
    "these are high confidence constraints obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . a new experimental technique suited for obtaining stronger constraints on the yukawa - type interaction from the measurements of the casimir - polder force",
    "is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently one more determination of the limits on the yukawa - type interaction in the range of about @xmath4 m from the measurement of the casimir force using a torsion balance has been reported @xcite . in this experiment",
    "a glass plate and a spherical lens of @xmath151 cm radius were used as the test bodies , both coated with a 20 nm cr layer and then with a @xmath4 m layer of au .",
    "this experiment is not an independent measurement of the casimir force , like experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , because the measurement data for the gradient of the force were fitted to the sum of two functions : the gradient of the expected electrostatic force and the gradient of the casimir force taking into account the conductivity and roughness effects . to obtain the limits on @xmath10 , the fit to the sum of three functions",
    "was performed with inclusion of the yukawa - type force and @xmath11 as an additional fitting parameter .",
    "the yukawa - type force was calculated using the results of ref .",
    "the obtained limits determined at a 95% confidence level are shown as the grey line in fig .",
    "5 . as can be seen in fig .  5 , these limits are a bit stronger than the limits obtained from the measurement of the casimir - polder force ( the solid line ) , but much weaker than the limits shown by the long - dashed line which are obtained @xcite from the measurement data of ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite note , however , that the accuracy of the experiment @xcite was overestimated and compare their limits not with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where much weaker constraints from the same measurement data @xcite were found . from this",
    "they conclude that their limits are stronger than those obtained on the basis of ref .",
    "it seems that this conclusion is not well justified .",
    "the point is that ref .",
    "@xcite had already taken into account that the accuracy of the experiment @xcite was overestimated ( this is discussed in @xcite in detail ) .",
    "the difference between the constraints obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite using the same data of ref .",
    "@xcite is explained by the fact that in @xcite the corrections due to the surface roughness , finite conductivity of the boundary metal and nonzero temperature were taken into account , whereas in @xcite they were disregarded .",
    "thus , in fact the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite are weaker than those following from the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite . the advantage of the constraints of ref .",
    "@xcite is that they are obtained at a high confidence level , whereas the confidence level of the constraints obtained from the data of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be determined on a solid basis .",
    "in the foregoing we have considered constraints on the yukawa - type corrections to newtonian gravity in micrometer and submicrometer interaction ranges following from the measurements of the casimir and casimir - polder forces .",
    "this field of research has already received wide recognition as an important adjunct to the gravitational experiments of etvos- and cavendish - type .",
    "novel constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type interactions from the casimir effect were obtained at a high confidence level and were used for constraining masses of predicted light elementary particles and other parameters of the theory of fundamental interactions beyond the standard model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed several experiments on measuring the casimir and casimir - polder force which were not used up to date for constraining corrections to newtonian gravity .",
    "the most striking result obtained above is that recent experiment on measuring the lateral casimir force between corrugated surfaces of a sphere and a plate @xcite leads to a great strengthening of the previously known high confidence constraints up to a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the constraints obtained from this experiment are shown to be the strongest in the interaction range from 1.6 to 14 nm .",
    "this raises a question on the role of corrugated surfaces in other experimental configurations used to obtain constraints on the parameters of yukawa - type interactions .",
    "the influence of sinusoidal corrugations on the yukawa force was calculated above by using the approximate method of geometrical averaging .",
    "this method is applicable under several conditions which are well satisfied for the experimental configurations considered in the paper .",
    "in fact , the geometrical averaging works better for the yukawa force than for the casimir force .",
    "the point is that the yukawa force is static and is not influenced by the diffraction - type effects which are essential for the casimir force ( the better applicability of the geometrical averaging to the electrostatic than to the casimir force was also noted in ref .",
    "we have shown that the replacement of a plane plate with a sinusoidally corrugated plate in the experiment on measuring the normal casimir force in a sphere - plate configuration @xcite would strengthen the constraints obtained from the measurement data of ref .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "next , we have obtained constraints on the yukawa - type interaction from the measurement data of the dynamic experiment using a micromechanical torsional oscillator @xcite when the plane plate is replaced with the corrugated one .",
    "it was shown that up to an order of magnitude strengthening is achievable in this way in comparison with the previously obtained constraints .",
    "we have also obtained constraints from the measurement data of two dynamic experiments which were not used previously for constraining the yukawa - type interaction .",
    "these are the measurement of the gradient of the casimir pressure in the configuration of two parallel plates @xcite and of the gradient of the thermal casimir - polder force between an atom and a dielectric plate @xcite .",
    "for the parallel plate experiment , the obtained constraints are weaker than those obtained from other experiments , but they can be significantly strengthened by replacing a cr metal coating with a thicker au coating . for the experiment dealing with the casimir - polder interaction , a frequency shift of the condensate oscillating due to the presence of yukawa - type interaction was found .",
    "it was shown that the obtained constraints are weaker than those found in ref .",
    "@xcite from the torsion pendulum experiment @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the constraints following from the measurement of the casimir - polder interaction are of almost the same strength as the constraints obtained in recent experiment @xcite .",
    "for both the experiment with two parallel plates and the measurement of the casimir - polder force , the replacement of a plane plate with a grating does not lead to a notable improvement in the strength of constraints because of the relatively large separation distances between the test bodies in these experiments .",
    "thus , we have shown that the use of the measurement data of recent experiment on the lateral casimir force leads to more than seven orders of magnitude strengthening in the previously obtained constraints .",
    "we have demonstrated that even higher promise is expected from the measurement of the normal casimir force by means of an afm if the plane plate were replaced with a corrugated plate .",
    "these results and the analysis of some other experiments confirm prospective future trends for obtaining stronger constraints on non - newtonian gravity from the measurement of both the casimir and casimir - polder forces .",
