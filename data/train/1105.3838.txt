    "in the last 1015 years , the @xmath0cdm model has been established as the standard model of large - scale cosmology ; the model is an excellent match to many observations including the anisotropies in the cmb measured by wmap @xcite and other experiments , the large - scale clustering of galaxies @xcite , the hubble diagram for high - z supernovae @xcite , and the abundance and baryon fraction of rich clusters of galaxies @xcite .    despite these great observational successes",
    ", the model appears unnatural since 96% of the universe s mass - energy is not observed , but is only inferred from fitting the observations .",
    "also , the dark sector contains at least two apparently unrelated components , dark matter and dark energy ; recent reviews of dark energy are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most direct evidence for cosmic acceleration comes from the hubble diagram of type - ia supernovae @xcite , which shows that sne at @xmath3 are fainter , relative to local sne , than can be accommodated in any friedmann - robertson - walker model without dark energy .",
    "a model - independent approach has also been given by @xcite , who show that the sne results require accelerated expansion at @xmath4 at around the @xmath5 significance level _ without _ assuming the friedmann equations .    however , there are some possible loopholes in the supernova results : since they are fundamentally based on brightness measurements , the interpretation could be affected by either unexpected evolution of the mean sne properties over cosmic time , or some process which removes photons en route to our telescopes , such as peculiar dust or more exotic effects such as photon - dark matter interactions . the simplest such effects with monotonic time - dependence are strongly disfavoured by sn observations at @xmath6 @xcite , but more complex time - dependent effects could still leave these loopholes open .",
    "independent of supernovae , there is powerful support for dark energy from observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and the large - scale clustering of galaxies @xcite , but this is dependent on assuming general relativity and the friedmann equations ; if these both hold , the model parameters are tightly constrained by cmb and lss data , and the expansion history @xmath7 must match @xmath0cdm models within a few percent .",
    "however , in alternative gravity theories , we can not make model - independent statements from the cmb or large - scale structure : clearly any successful modified - gravity model should eventually be consistent with these observations , but the model space of modified gravity is large and the calculations non - trivial ; so in non - gr models we can not necessarily use the cmb and lss observations to make any definite statement about recent acceleration .",
    "the accelerated expansion is so startling that it is desirable to test it via multiple routes with a minimum number of model assumptions .",
    "a very direct test of acceleration has been proposed using the `` cosmic drift '' , which is the small change in redshift for fixed object(s ) over time ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the predicted change is @xmath8 .",
    "however , this effect is tiny over human timescales , of order cm / s / year , and will probably require over 20 years baseline to get a convincing detection .",
    "here we propose a new and robust test for cosmic acceleration based only on the cosmic `` standard ruler '' in the galaxy correlation function : in the standard model , this is a feature created by acoustic oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid before recombination ( e.g. @xcite ) ; this was analysed in more detail by @xcite and @xcite , then first detected in 2005 by @xcite in sdss data , and @xcite using the 2dfgrs survey .",
    "the length of this ruler , hereafter @xmath9 , depends only on matter and radiation densities and is accurately predicted from cmb observations at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "many recent studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have shown how precision measurements of this bao scale from huge galaxy redshift surveys can provide powerful constraints on the properties of dark energy , and test for evolution of dark energy density ; more details are given in section  [ sec : bao ] .",
    "however , in the current paper we do * not * assume any gravity theory or the actual length scale of this feature , only that we can observe some feature at a specific lengthscale imprinted on the galaxy distribution at high redshift , which expands with the hubble expansion and remains a constant ruler in comoving coordinates .",
    "we then derive an inequality relating observations comparing this ruler at low and intermediate redshift , which is satisfied in _ any reasonable _ non - accelerating model , but is violated by accelerating models approximating @xmath0cdm . in more detail",
    ", we use the _ radial _ component of the bao feature at @xmath11 to constrain the product @xmath12 , and we then compare to the _ spherical - averaged _ bao feature at low redshift @xmath13 , which is related to the average of @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "then , assuming any non - accelerating model we derive a strict upper limit on the ratio of these .",
    "models approximating standard @xmath0cdm predict a result which violates this inequality by a substantial amount @xmath16 , depending on cosmological parameters and redshift .",
    "future large redshift surveys should be able to measure this ratio to @xmath17 precision : assuming our inequality is significantly violated as predicted , we can then exclude all homogeneous non - accelerating models regardless of friedmann equations , gravity theory or details of the expansion history .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in   [ sec : bao ] we review the basic features and observables of baryon acoustic oscillations . in   [ sec : trap ] we derive the new inequality relating bao observables for non - accelerating models . in   [ sec : disc ] we discuss future observations and related issues , and we summarise our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillation ( hereafter bao ) feature @xcite is a bump in the galaxy correlation function @xmath18 , or equivalently a decaying series of wiggles in the power spectrum @xmath19 , corresponding to a comoving length denoted by @xmath9 , created by acoustic waves in the early universe prior to decoupling .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the standard model ,",
    "its length - scale is essentially set by the distance that a sound wave can propagate prior to the `` drag epoch '' at @xmath20 , denoted @xmath21 , and this length depends only on physical densities of matter @xmath22 and baryons @xmath23 , ( together with radiation density @xmath24 which is pinned very precisely by the cmb temperature ) . in the standard model",
    "the relative heights of the acoustic peaks in cmb anisotropies constrain @xmath22 and @xmath23 well @xcite , which leads to a prediction @xmath25 comoving with approximately 1.5 percent precision .",
    "this predicted length does not rely on the assumption of a flat universe , since the relative cmb peak heights constrain the various densities reasonably well without assuming flatness .",
    "however , the cmb - predicted length @xmath26 does depend on assuming standard gr , and several assumptions about the mass - energy budget including standard neutrino content , negligible early dark energy , no late - decaying dark matter , negligible admixture of isocurvature perturbations , etc .",
    "however , in the rest of this paper we leave @xmath9 as an arbitrary comoving scale , which cancels later .",
    "the bao feature provides a standard ruler which can be observed at low to moderate redshift using very large galaxy redshift surveys ; in the small angle approximation and assuming we observe a redshift shell which is thin compared with its mean redshift @xmath27 , there are two primary observables derived from a bao survey : firstly the angle on the sky subtended by the bao feature transverse to the line of sight , @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is the conventional ( proper ) angular - diameter distance to redshift @xmath27 ; and secondly the difference in redshift along one bao length along the line of sight is @xmath30 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that calculating comoving galaxy separations from observed positions and redshifts requires a reference cosmology , hence a difference between the true and reference cosmology will produce an error in the inferred @xmath9 ; however , any error in the reference model cancels to first order in the dimensionless ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so both of these ratios can be well constrained with minimal theory - dependence by measuring baos in a galaxy redshift survey .    the ability to independently probe",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath33 is a powerful advantage of baos over other low - redshift cosmological tests .",
    "furthermore , a redshift survey useful for baos can also measure growth of structure via redshift - space distortions and thus test for consistency with gr , though we do not consider this here .",
    "however , in practice , current galaxy redshift surveys are not quite large enough to robustly measure the bao feature separately in angular and radial directions ( though there are tentative detections , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the current measurements primarily constrain a spherically - averaged scale , called @xmath34 , which is defined by @xcite as @xmath35^{1/3 } \\ ; \\ ] ] this is essentially a geometric mean of two transverse directions and one radial direction .",
    "observations using the 2dfgrs and sdss - ii redshift surveys have measured the dimensionless ratio @xmath36 at low redshifts @xcite , which we discuss later .",
    "we note that as @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; however , this approximation is not very useful in practice , since we can not measure the bao feature at very low redshift @xmath39 where corrections of order @xmath40 are unimportant .",
    "we give a better approximation below in   [ sec : dvapprox ] .    in practice ,",
    "the bao feature is not a sharp spike but a hump in @xmath18 of width approximately 15% of @xmath9 , so there are several subtle effects in actually extracting the scale @xmath9 from a redshift survey : we discuss these in more detail in   [ sec : rshift ] .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper we only need to assume that @xmath9 is a constant comoving length to @xmath41 at redshift @xmath42 , so these precision details are relatively unimportant for the rest of this paper .",
    "here we derive a new inequality which we denote the `` cosmic speed - trap '' , which must be satisfied by any reasonable non - accelerating model , but is violated by @xmath0cdm and other accelerating models .",
    "we start off by assuming an arbitrary non - accelerating model , and deriving a lower limit for @xmath43 in terms of the value of @xmath44 at a _ higher _ redshift @xmath45 .",
    "then , we form a ratio of bao observables which eliminates @xmath44 and @xmath9 , and we obtain the speed - trap inequality ( [ eq : xs ] ) which forms our main new result .      here",
    "we derive an inequality for @xmath46 which is satisfied in any non - accelerating model , but may be violated by acceleration .",
    "first we define as usual @xmath47 to be the cosmic expansion factor relative to the present day with @xmath48 , redshift @xmath27 by @xmath49 , and the hubble parameter @xmath50 where dot represents time derivative .",
    "then we have the expansion rate @xmath51 if the expansion of the universe was non - accelerating , then @xmath52 is non - positive and the function above must be non - increasing with time or @xmath47 , therefore non - decreasing with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , if we consider any two redshifts @xmath53 , in any non - accelerating universe , @xmath54 assuming only the cosmological principle , any observed violation of this inequality is a direct proof that the expansion has accelerated , on average , between the earlier epoch @xmath45 and the later epoch @xmath55 , without reference to any specific theory of gravity or geometry",
    ".    a concordance @xmath0cdm model _ does _ violate this inequality due to the recent positive acceleration : a minimum value of @xmath56 occurred at @xmath57{2\\,\\omega_\\lambda /\\omega_m } - 1 $ ] ; for the concordance value @xmath58 , this gives @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . the expansion rate @xmath56 is shown in figure  [ fig : hz ] for a few representative models : it is notable that the value of @xmath56 remains within a few percent of its minimum between @xmath61 , and it rises rather sharply at low redshift ; for the concordance model it only crosses the half - way value between the minimum and the present - day @xmath62 at the modest redshift of @xmath63 , and three - quarters of the speedup has occurred since @xmath64 .",
    "thus the actual speedup of the expansion rate is quite concentrated at rather low redshift ; this becomes relevant later .",
    ".cosmological parameters for the four example models discussed in the text ; model c is the baseline concordance model , while the others are selected to roughly span the current @xmath65 allowed range in @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "all are flat , and have @xmath62 adjusted to give very similar values of @xmath68 consistent with wmap , therefore have similar values of @xmath69 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     next , we suppose we have a measurement of @xmath44 at an earlier epoch @xmath45 ; for a non - accelerating model we now derive a _ lower limit _ on @xmath43 at a later epoch @xmath55 where @xmath53 .",
    "the comoving radial distance to redshift @xmath55 is @xmath70 if the universe is non - accelerating and @xmath53 , we can rearrange inequality ( [ eq : hineq ] ) into @xmath71 $ ] ; inserting this we have @xmath72    the proper angular - diameter distance @xmath29 is defined by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the curvature radius of the universe in comoving mpc , @xmath75 , and the function @xmath76 = @xmath77 for the cases @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the sign of the curvature .",
    "note that in the above we have left @xmath80 as a constant but arbitrary curvature radius , thus we have _ not _ assumed the friedmann equation which gives @xmath81 ; we have only assumed that the universe has a metric with some well - defined curvature radius @xmath80 , which follows from the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy @xcite .",
    "also , we have not assumed any functional form for @xmath33 , only that it obeys the non - acceleration condition ( [ eq : hineq ] ) at all @xmath82 ; what happened earlier at @xmath83 is immaterial .",
    "for the other term in @xmath34 , we use a similar inequality for @xmath84 as above , which is @xmath85 substituting both of the above into eq .",
    "[ eq : dv ] , we obtain the inequality @xmath86^{1/3 } \\ , \\left({s_k(x_1 )",

    "this inequality is strict for any non - accelerating and homogeneous universe with a robertson - walker metric , independent of details of the expansion history or the gravity model .",
    "this is not so useful on its own , but we will see in the next section how to combine observables to cancel the @xmath45 dependence .",
    "we note that the factor @xmath88 exactly for flat models , and is @xmath89 for open models ( so open models always strengthen the inequality ) ; the factor is @xmath90 for closed models which weakens our inequality , but only by a small amount if we consider sufficiently low redshift @xmath55 , since the effect of curvature on distances only enters to third order in @xmath27 ; at small @xmath91 and @xmath92 we have @xmath93 therefore we need an upper limit on @xmath91 for closed models .",
    "we get a firm limit as follows , using an upper bound on @xmath94 and a lower bound on @xmath80 for closed models .    to limit @xmath94",

    "this gives @xmath99 .",
    "we may also obtain a lower bound on @xmath80 as follows : in a closed model , it is clear from eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] and @xmath100 that @xmath29 can not exceed @xmath101 regardless of the expansion history @xmath33 .",
    "if we take for example @xmath102 and @xmath103 , this leads to @xmath104 , only @xmath105 the concordance value of @xmath106",
    ". however , observed angular sizes of @xmath107 galaxies already convert to rather small physical sizes based on the concordance model , and making them smaller by another factor @xmath108 appears to be seriously discrepant .",
    "we therefore exclude closed models with @xmath109 .    a stronger lower bound",
    "may be obtained with other methods : e.g. the luminosity distance @xmath110 measured from sne @xcite agrees well with the concordance model , and if we adopt a lower bound @xmath111 the concordance value , we obtain @xmath112 .",
    "however , to remain fully independent of sne data we do not use this below .",
    "a stronger limit should also be possible in future using angular bao measurements at @xmath107 , e.g. from the hetdex or boss projects .",
    "however , for the following we take @xmath113 as a conservative gravity - independent lower limit for closed models .",
    "this leads to a firm upper limit @xmath114 for closed non - accelerating models , which we use below .",
    "the above inequality ( [ eq : dvineq ] ) relates the volume - distance @xmath43 at low redshift to the hubble constant @xmath44 at a higher redshift .",
    "neither of these quantities are directly observable at present , but it is possible to measure both of them relative to the bao length - scale @xmath9 ; then , dividing these two cancels the length scale @xmath9 and gives a ratio measurement . applying the @xmath34 inequality above gives us a limit which must be satisfied by any reasonable non - accelerating model , but is found to be violated by an expansion history close to @xmath0cdm , for a range of suitable choices of @xmath115 .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath44 may be measured using the _ radial _ bao scale ( along the line of sight ) in a redshift shell near @xmath45 ; for a thin shell and ignoring redshift - space distortion effects , this gives the observable @xmath116 in practice it is useful to divide by @xmath117 and define @xmath118 since this @xmath119 is rather close to a constant over a substantial range of redshift in a @xmath0cdm model ( as in figure  [ fig : hz ] ) , and we will see that it has a convenient cancellation below .    using the sdss - ii redshift survey , @xcite have already measured the dimensionless ratio @xmath120 at redshift @xmath121 and 0.35 , and also a combined ratio at @xmath122 .",

    "we now form the ratio of observables @xmath123 which gives , from the definitions above @xmath124 assuming only that @xmath9 is a fixed comoving ruler independent of @xmath27 .",
    "if we now assume that the universe has never accelerated below redshift @xmath45 , we may apply the inequality ( [ eq : dvineq ] ) for @xmath43 ; this cancels the @xmath45 factors , giving the inequality @xmath125^{1/3 }     \\left({x_1 \\over s_k(x_1)}\\right)^{2/3 }   \\quad .\\ ] ]    it is more convenient to rearrange this to put the square - bracket term on the lhs , and define the quantity @xmath126 ( `` excess speed '' ) by @xmath127^{1/3 }    \\le    \\left({x_1 \\over s_k(x_1)}\\right)^{2/3 }   \\ , ; \\ ] ] where @xmath126 is a ratio of observables , and @xmath128 as before .",

    "the expansion has never accelerated in the interval @xmath132 .",
    "if the speed - trap is observationally violated , @xmath133 at high significance , one or more of assumptions ( i)-(iv ) above must be false , independent of gravity theory or friedmann equations . to apply this test",
    ", we also require an upper bound on the rhs , i.e. an upper bound on @xmath134 for closed models , which we derive below ( this is not strictly a fifth `` assumption '' , since it follows from observational data assuming ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) above ) . in inequality ( [ eq : xs ] ) , the lhs @xmath126 is formed from a ratio of two dimensionless bao observables @xmath135 and @xmath136 , while the rhs is close to 1 with a weak dependence on curvature : the effect of curvature on the low - redshift @xmath43 is folded into the factor containing @xmath137 on the rhs .",
    "as noted above , this is exactly 1 for flat models and is always @xmath138 for open models , so open models always tighten the speed trap . for closed ( positively curved ) models",
    "the @xmath137 factor is @xmath139 , which weakens the trap slightly ; however , at low redshift @xmath55 this is a small effect as follows : from the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : dvlim ] , for closed models we found a conservative lower limit @xmath113 ; this leads to @xmath140 , thus for example the rhs is @xmath141 for @xmath142 . the top solid curve in figure  [ fig : xs ]",
    "shows the resulting upper limit on the rhs of ( [ eq : xs ] ) assuming the very conservative limit @xmath113 , while the next - to - top solid curve shows the limit assuming @xmath143 .",
    "thus , if actual observations reveal that @xmath144 with good significance , the cosmic speed - trap `` flashes '' : if so , we can then rule out all homogeneous non - accelerated models regardless of the detailed expansion history or gravity model .    in the above eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] , the square bracket term in @xmath126 is given to first order by @xmath145 .",
    "higher order terms are small , and a quadratic approximation is not an improvement ; a slightly better approximation is @xmath146 which is accurate to @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "note that the rhs of ( [ eq : xs ] ) has no dependence on @xmath45 ; the curvature radius @xmath80 has no effect on the observable @xmath136 since @xmath119 is purely a line - of - sight measurement .",
    "therefore , we may choose to measure @xmath136 anywhere , but if the real universe is accelerating , the observed @xmath126 will be maximal when @xmath45 is close to the past minimum of @xmath136 , at @xmath149 .      in figure",

    "[ eq : xs ] ) is shown as solid lines for several assumed values of curvature radius @xmath80 .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : xs ] that if the real universe has followed an expansion history @xmath33 similar to @xmath0cdm prediction , inequality [ eq : xs ] will be violated if @xmath55 is reasonably small and @xmath45 is near @xmath152 .",
    "essentially , the accelerated expansion between @xmath45 and @xmath55 causes the value of @xmath56 to be larger at @xmath153 than in the past at @xmath45 , as in figure 1 ; this makes @xmath43 smaller and @xmath154 larger , compared to any non - accelerating model with the same @xmath44 , so @xmath126 violates the limit in eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] .",
    "as noted above , to maximise the violation we should choose @xmath45 to minimise the observed value of @xmath136 , i.e. the redshift @xmath151 where @xmath56 had its past minimum ; for a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath155 , the actual minimum is at @xmath59 , but the theoretical @xmath156 is within 2% of its minimum value over a rather broad window @xmath157 : so for an observational application of the test , @xmath45 may be whatever is most convenient observationally within this range , with only marginal weakening of the trap .    turning to the variation of @xmath126 with @xmath55 ,",
    "the predicted value of @xmath126 is maximal at @xmath158 ( with a value of 1.185 for our reference model c ) , and slowly declines with @xmath55 : thus lower @xmath55 is better both to maximise lever - arm in our speed - trap , and to minimise curvature uncertainty . however , for practical observations @xmath55 can not be too small since we need sufficient cosmic volume to get a robust detection of the acoustic feature in the galaxy correlation function @xmath18 or power spectrum @xmath19 ; therefore there is a tradeoff between @xmath126 which declines with @xmath55 , the curvature uncertainty also favours smaller @xmath55 , but the available cosmic volume for measuring @xmath135 grows with @xmath55 .",

    "we also note that the value of @xmath126 is fairly sensitive to the value of @xmath66 : taking example cases from table  [ tab : models ] with @xmath166 to bracket the plausible range , we find that @xmath167 , 1.185 , 1.143 respectively ; while @xmath168 is 1.142 , 1.113 , 1.081 . for each model",
    ", @xmath169 approximately halves from @xmath158 to @xmath170 .",
    "this is because the rate of acceleration grows with time after @xmath151 , so @xmath126 has stronger than linear dependence on @xmath171 .",
    "we note here that the prediction for @xmath126 is independent of @xmath62 if all of @xmath66 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath67 are held fixed .",
    "however , since our example models are approximately cmb - matched , a correlation appears , because raising @xmath66 and/or @xmath67 compared to the concordance model requires lowering @xmath62 to remain consistent with the cmb ; while raising @xmath66 or @xmath67 also leads to weaker acceleration and thus lowers @xmath126 . thus , @xmath126 at a fixed redshift is positively correlated with @xmath62 in cmb - matched friedmann models .",
    "we also note that for accelerating models @xmath126 remains a few percent greater than 1 for the case @xmath174 ; this occurs because @xmath136 measures the instantaneous expansion rate at @xmath45 , while @xmath135 depends on the average expansion rate at redshifts below @xmath55 , which is larger . in principle",
    "we could use this to test acceleration by measuring @xmath175 and @xmath119 from a single survey at @xmath174 , but in practice the curvature uncertainty probably disfavours this ( see sec  [ sec : ap ] for more discussion ) .",
    "in this section we discuss various aspects of the test above , including possible shifts in length @xmath9 , useful approximations for @xmath46 , observational issues , the relation to the alcock - paczynski ratio and the effect of giant - void models .",
    "in applying the speed - trap , clearly assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) above are very basic ; if future observations show the speed - trap is observationally violated , we need to be confident that assumption ( iii ) on constancy of @xmath9 is valid to around @xmath176 , in order to reject general homogeneous non - accelerating models with high confidence .    we now consider some details which may actually give rise to a significant shift in comoving @xmath9 between redshifts @xmath55 and @xmath45 ; the main such effects are galaxy bias , non - linear growth of structure , redshift - space distortions @xcite , and possible effects due to the hump(s ) sitting on a sloping background power spectrum etc .",
    "we first note that there is non - negligible evolution in @xmath26 at high redshift between @xmath20 and @xmath177 , as shown by figure  1 of @xcite ; the initial bao bump is only in the baryons and photons , and the peak shifts slightly as the dark - matter and baryon perturbations align together at later times ; this implies the late - time bao peak is not exactly at the sound horizon length @xmath178 .",
    "however , after @xmath179 the density perturbations in baryons and dark matter are very similar . in most real bao analyses , a matter power spectrum from cmbfast or similar",
    "is used , together with a model for non - linear evolution and an arbitrary linear `` stretch factor '' @xmath180 , to fit observations ; finally , the measurement is quoted as @xmath181 where @xmath26 and @xmath34 are both computed from the reference theoretical model .",
    "this implies that small errors in the reference model should ( on average ) be absorbed into an opposite shift in @xmath180 , so the final estimate of @xmath154 should be unbiased .",
    "any shift in the bao length from @xmath182 to @xmath177 is included in the reference model ; therefore , @xmath178 forms essentially a convenient fiducial length for intercomparison between models , which is close to but not exactly the position of the low - redshift bao peak in the correlation function . for the present work ,",
    "we are only interested in shifts of the bao scale at @xmath183 , so the above effect cancels .",
    "galaxy bias , at least in standard versions , has little effect since the bao scale is very much larger than any scale of relevance for galaxy formation ; thus bias may affect the overall amplitude of galaxy clustering but can not significantly shift the scale @xmath9 . likewise , non - linear growth of structure primarily moves galaxies around on @xmath184 scales ; this significantly blurs the bump in @xmath18 , and/or erases the higher harmonics in the power spectrum , but this is almost symmetrical between inward and outward shifts : the systematic shift in the bao lengthscale is much smaller .    for the standard model , these effects have been investigated from both theory by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , and from large n - body simulations by @xcite and @xcite ; these papers agree that systematic shifts are small , typically below the @xmath185 level at @xmath186 and less at higher redshift .",
    "they also find that reconstruction methods based on velocity - field reconstruction @xcite can reduce the shift to @xmath187 .",
    "this will become important for the next generation of ambitious planned surveys such as esa s euclid ( e.g. @xcite ) or nasa s wfirst , which aim to achieve sub - percent precision on bao observables in many redshift bins , but are almost negligible with respect to the speed - trap test in this paper .",
    "we caution that there is a slight level of circular argument in the above , in that we are assuming standard cosmology to limit the shift in @xmath9 , and then using this to reject non - standard non - accelerating models ; it remains possible that a model with non - standard gravity could produce a much larger shift in @xmath9 than the standard cosmology .",
    "however , non - standard models producing a gross @xmath188 shift in @xmath9 since @xmath11 would almost certainly produce large levels of redshift - space distortion , and give strong inconsistencies between the angular and radial measurements of @xmath9 at low redshift .",
    "if both the redshift - space distortion pattern and the radial and angular measurements of @xmath9 are measured to be consistent with standard @xmath0cdm , this would strongly suggest that the true shifts in @xmath9 should not be much larger than the percent level effects predicted by the standard model .      as an aside",
    ", we also note that in nearly - flat cdm - like models , an accurate approximation to @xmath46 at moderate redshift is given by taylor - expanding @xmath14 around @xmath189 ( rather than zero ) , and substituting in the integral eq .",
    "[ eq : dr ] ; this makes @xmath40 terms vanish , and leads to the approximation @xmath190^{1/3 } }   + o(z^3 )   \\ ; \\label{eq : dvapp1}\\ ] ] in practice the first term is surprisingly accurate for @xmath0cdm models , with errors @xmath191 compared to the numerical result for @xmath192 .",
    "( see appendix a for evaluation of the third - order term , and explanation why it is small ) .",
    "a simpler approximation is @xmath193 this is slightly less accurate than the previous approximation , but still accurate to @xmath194 for @xmath192 , better than the mid - term precision on observables .",
    "( for open zero-@xmath0 models these approximations are less good , with errors up to @xmath195 ) .",
    "while it is straightforward to evaluate @xmath34 and @xmath126 numerically for any given model , the main value of this approximation is that it tells us that a measurement of @xmath196 at low redshift is quite close to a measurement of @xmath197 ; substituting this into ( [ eq : xs ] ) , along with the approximation @xmath145 for the square - bracket term , gives simply @xmath198 and inequality [ eq : hineq ] tells us this should be less than 1 for non - accelerated models . unlike our upper limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) this expression is not rigorous , but this gives a simple and fairly accurate approximation for what @xmath126 is measuring , i.e. it is closely related to the ratio of expansion rates @xmath199 at @xmath200 compared to @xmath45 .",
    "one possible objection to this test is that it is comparing two related but slightly different observables , i.e. a spherical - average scale at @xmath55 with a radial scale at @xmath45 .",
    "why have we done this , rather than comparing two measures of @xmath154 or two measures of @xmath156 at two different redshifts ?",
    "it is well known that comparing @xmath156 at two different redshifts provides another direct test of acceleration .",
    "the main difficulty is observational , since for our baseline model , @xmath201 only grows to @xmath202 at rather low redshift @xmath203 .",
    "furthermore , for a given survey , a radial - only measurement of @xmath9 has a statistical error roughly @xmath204 worse than a spherical average measure . even if we had a @xmath205 steradian redshift survey at @xmath206 , we may not do much better than 3% statistical error on @xmath119 , a @xmath207 violation , and we would like to get above @xmath5 for a decisive result .",
    "using @xmath135 instead of @xmath119 gives two substantial advantages : firstly @xmath135 effectively measures @xmath208 at @xmath209 , giving more lever - arm on the low - redshift acceleration ; so a measurement of @xmath210 is similar in content to a measurement of @xmath211 .",
    "secondly there is the obvious gain that @xmath175 uses 3 spatial directions instead of 1 .",
    "thus for a fixed thickness of survey shell , the former measure has around 9/4 times more available volume and 3 independent axes , so the cosmic variance limit should improve by a factor @xmath212 , which is a very important practical advantage .",
    "in contrast , comparing @xmath154 at two different redshifts suffers from potential major uncertainty in cosmic curvature at the high redshift @xmath45 . at @xmath213",
    "there is ample available volume for a precision measurement of @xmath119 , and ambitious future probes such as euclid ( @xcite ) plan to push to statistical errors @xmath214 on both @xmath119 and @xmath175 , in each of many bins of width 0.1 in redshift .",
    "thus , at @xmath45 the cosmic variance is minimal for a wide - area survey , so the radial measure is preferable because it is independent of the curvature nuisance parameter .",
    "also , @xmath215 depends on the full history of @xmath33 back to @xmath45 , which complicates the issue of deriving an inequality .    in our proposed comparison ,",
    "we have constructed a ratio @xmath126 using @xmath135 at low redshift and @xmath136 at the higher redshift , to circumvent both of these problems : the potential cosmic - variance limits are probably around @xmath216 on @xmath217 and significantly less on @xmath218 , so this test can ( given ample data ) deliver a standalone rejection of homogeneous non - accelerating models at @xmath219 significance level .",
    "this can be further improved by using several independent redshift bins , e.g. @xmath220 and @xmath221 .      as noted above ,",
    "there already exist measurements of the numerator on the left of eq .",
    "[ eq : ydlim ] from @xcite ; they quote values of @xmath222 and @xmath223 , with approximately 3.3% error on each . for the numerator @xmath224 in inequality ( [ eq : xs ] ) these give @xmath225 and @xmath226 .    as yet there is no available measurement of radial baos at @xmath227 with which to actually calibrate our speed - trap , but these are expected soon in @xcite , one from wigglez at @xmath228 in @xcite , and one from sdss photo - z s at @xmath229 in @xcite .",
    "all of these show good consistency with the concordance model , but do not yet measure the radial component as required here . ] from the recently completed aat wigglez survey @xcite , and in a few years from the ongoing boss survey @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear whether the final wigglez survey covers enough volume to separately measure the radial component as required here , but boss should very likely achieve this ; the upper redshift limit of boss is @xmath230 , so this is close enough to @xmath231 to be useful .    for @xmath0cdm , the predicted value of @xmath136 near its minimum is approximately 0.0302 for @xmath155 and @xmath103 . for reasonable variations of parameters ,",
    "we now show that if we assume a flat universe then @xmath136 is well constrained by cmb observations : it is well known that for flat models with varying @xmath232 there is a tight correlation between the age of the universe , @xmath69 , and the cmb acoustic scale @xmath68 @xcite ; and it turns out that there is also a tight correlation between these and the value of @xmath208 at intermediate redshift , with a pivot point occurring at @xmath233 ( see figure  [ fig : hz ] ) .",
    "this is partly a coincidence , because for moderate parameter variations around the concordance model , @xmath69 scales @xmath234 , while @xmath68 scales as @xmath235 .",
    "for the value of @xmath33 , we note that as @xmath37 this scales as @xmath236 independent of @xmath237 , while at @xmath238 where dark energy is negligible , @xmath33 scales @xmath239",
    ". therefore , there exists a pivot - point at intermediate redshift where @xmath33 scales as @xmath240 ( i.e. inversely to @xmath69 ) , and this pivot redshift turns out to be @xmath241 for @xmath0 models . for @xmath242 the pivot redshift is somewhat lower , but for near - flat friedmann models the value @xmath243 is better constrained by wmap data than the local @xmath62 ; and fixing @xmath244 constrains @xmath245 within @xmath246 , which in turn leads to a tight prediction for @xmath218 .",
    "( as an aside , there is a corollary that if some future method could give a direct measurement of @xmath243 independently of @xmath26 , this would produce another strong consistency test of standard @xmath0cdm .",
    "this may be possible in principle using methods such as differential - age measurements of early - type galaxies , or lensing measurements with source and lens close in redshift , but this will require a major advance in precision over current data ) .",
    "assuming some future @xmath119 measurement turns out at the concordance value @xmath247 , we would then obtain measurements @xmath248 and 1.05 at @xmath142 , 0.35 respectively .",
    "the error on @xmath136 must be added in quadrature to the current 3.3% error on @xmath135 , but if the former is around 2% then we can anticipate a fairly clear violation from the @xmath121 value , and a somewhat less significant violation at @xmath249 .",
    "the prospects are good for improving on the current results : the projections for the boss survey @xcite are for @xmath216 precision on @xmath250 , and precision of @xmath251 on @xmath252 . adding the above errors in quadrature leads to around 2% precision on @xmath126 , with a predicted value @xmath253 , thus nearly a @xmath254 proof of acceleration .",
    "boss may also do better using the larger value of @xmath126 at @xmath13 , but projected precision on @xmath255 is not quoted separately .",
    "next - generation surveys in the planning stage such as bigboss , euclid or wfirst should substantially improve on the higher - redshift measurement , reaching sub - percent precision on @xmath136 . the low - redshift @xmath135 measurement is ultimately limited by cosmic variance , but extending the boss survey to the southern hemisphere can give a straightforward improvement by a factor of @xmath256 , or probably more if denser sampling of galaxies is used .",
    "further improvements are possible in principle using hi or near - infrared selected surveys which can cover @xmath257 of the whole sky , compared to @xmath258 for visible - selected surveys .",
    "we note here that our ratio @xmath126 may be considered as a generalised version of the classic test of @xcite , hereafter ap : the ap ratio was defined to be @xmath259 , which in our notation becomes @xmath260 if we choose @xmath174 in eq .",
    "[ eq : dovery ] above and substitute eq .",
    "[ eq : dv ] for @xmath34 , we then obtain @xmath261 thus @xmath262 contains the same information as @xmath263 combined with a function of @xmath55 ; substituting the above into eq .",
    "[ eq : xs ] gives a lower limit on @xmath264 for non - accelerating models , which is @xmath265    it is well known that if we assume the friedmann equations , the ap test at high redshift provides a strong test for @xmath0 or dark energy : however , if we drop the friedmann connection between curvature and matter content , then at @xmath266 the ap test becomes mostly degenerate between acceleration and curvature . at lower @xmath4 , we may use the approximation @xmath267 from above , which leads to @xmath268 .",
    "this does have more sensitivity to acceleration than curvature , but is not ideal for the following reason : at small @xmath55 the ap ratio suffers from a short redshift lever - arm , while at @xmath269 the ratio mainly probes the regime of sluggish acceleration at @xmath270 .",
    "the ap ratio at @xmath271 may provide a useful test , but will probably require sub - percent level precision on both observables to get a decisive result .",
    "compared to the ap test , the use of two widely - spaced redshifts in @xmath126 requires the added assumption that @xmath26 has minimal evolution between @xmath45 and @xmath55 , but enables a much longer effective time lever - arm , giving a larger acceleration signal while keeping the curvature sensitivity very small .",
    "recently there has been some interest in models which produce apparent acceleration without dark energy , by placing us near the centre of a giant underdense spherical void , with a lemaitre - tolman - bondi metric ; examples are in @xcite and references therein .",
    "these models have several problems such as severe fine - tuning of our location very close to the void centre , and probable inconsistency with limits on the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite ; however it is interesting to note how @xmath126 behaves in such models .",
    "a recent confrontation of giant - void models with bao observables has been done by @xcite : they find that void models with profiles adjusted to match sne and cmb observations have a @xmath272 which is @xmath273 smaller at @xmath274 compared to @xmath0cdm .",
    "those specific cases would have @xmath275 , which is substantially larger than any reasonable dark - energy model ; thus , @xcite show that giant - void models matched to angular distances and the cmb appear to suffer from severe `` overkill '' in radial bao measurements .",
    "the parameter space of possible void models is very large , so other void models may look more similar to @xmath0cdm , but we note that the test of @xcite can be used to test for homogeneity _ without _ assuming gr .",
    "they show that if we have both angular and radial bao measurements spanning a range of redshift , there is a consistency relation which must be satisfied by homogeneous models but is usually violated by giant - void models .",
    "thus , assumption ( i ) above becomes observationally testable using future bao observations , though this probably requires observations spanning more redshifts than the @xmath126 test here .",
    "we have proposed a new and simple smoking - gun test for cosmic acceleration using only a comparison of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature at two distinct redshifts @xmath276 and @xmath277 . the main result of our paper is inequality  ( [ eq : xs ] ) relating the two dimensionless bao observables , which must be satisfied for any homogeneous non - accelerating model , but will be observationally violated by @xmath278 in models with an expansion history close to standard @xmath0cdm .    clearly , our proposed measurement has advantages and disadvantages : the main advantages are extreme simplicity and model - independence , i.e. if the inequality ( [ eq : xs ] ) is violated , we can rule out essentially all homogeneous non - accelerating models in one shot , without assuming any particular gravity theory or parametric form of @xmath33 , and independent of supernova and cmb observations .",
    "the main drawback of our test is that it is essentially one - sided : if inequality [ eq : xs ] is observationally violated , we have proved ( given some basic assumptions ) that acceleration has occurred during @xmath279 and have a rough quantification of the amount , but no more details about the underlying cause or the details of the expansion history .",
    "if we assume gr and the friedmann equations hold , and that @xmath9 has the value which is accurately predicted from cmb analysis , then we have much more statistical power : future measurements of baos in many redshift bins may be used to reconstruct the detailed form of the expansion history @xmath33 ; this can be integrated to give predictions of @xmath280 , and comparison with the measured transverse bao scale giving @xmath29 can constrain spatial curvature independent of the cmb ; while comparison of @xmath281 with @xmath282 from sne can check the distance - duality or tolman relation @xmath283 .",
    "all of this can give much more powerful cross - checks and parameter estimates than our simplified one - sided test .",
    "however , our proposed cosmic speed - trap seems to provide a valuable addition to the set of cosmological measurements , due to its bare minimum of assumptions .",
    "this provides a strong motivation for future improved bao measurements specifically near redshifts @xmath284 and 0.75 ; this should preferably include a low - redshift survey comparable or superior to boss in the southern hemisphere to minimise the cosmic variance in the local measurement .",
