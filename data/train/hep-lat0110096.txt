    "the axial current of one light and one heavy quark flavour is phenomenologically interesting , as the decay constant @xmath0 of the b - meson is defined by a matrix element of such a current .",
    "this matrix element requires a non - perturbative treatment , i.e. a lattice calculation .",
    "since the bottom quark is too heavy to be included directly in monte carlo simulations on today s computers , the use of effective theories like hqet is a necessity . in a recent paper  @xcite , we tested hqet for a special correlation function , and studied the discretisation errors connected with the heavy quark mass .",
    "the operators under investigation are the axial current @xmath1 of two relativistic quark flavours @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the static - light axial current @xmath4 where the static quark field satisfies @xmath5 and its dynamics is determined by the eichten - hill action  @xcite @xmath6    the correlation functions we use are defined in a finite space - time volume @xmath7 with schrdinger functional boundary conditions , i.e.    * the gauge field is periodic in space . *",
    "no spatial boundary conditions need to be specified for the static quark field .",
    "the relativistic quark fields are periodic in space up to a phase @xmath8 , e.g. ( with unit vector @xmath9 ) @xmath10 * dirichlet boundary conditions in time .",
    "the space - like link variables on the time boundaries are chosen as @xmath11 .",
    "correlation functions can contain derivatives @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 with respect to the boundary quark fields ( see  @xcite for their definition ) .",
    "we apply the symanzik improvement programme  @xcite to the axial currents , defining improved operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as to the action  @xcite .",
    "we use the correlation functions @xmath20",
    "our aim is to compare hqet with full qcd _ in the continuum limit _ , which requires renormalisation .",
    "a renormalised coupling is defined by matching to the @xmath21 scheme , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bare lattice coupling .",
    "the quark masses are also renormalised by matching to the @xmath21 scheme .",
    "the @xmath21 mass @xmath24 of the first quark flavour is chosen to be zero , while we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath25 to parametrise the mass of the second quark flavour .",
    "taking the continuum limit means @xmath26 while keeping @xmath27 fixed .",
    "we form the ratios @xmath28 in which the boundary field renormalisation constants and a divergence due to the heavy quark self energy cancel .",
    "these ratios are expanded as @xmath29 and analogously for @xmath30 .",
    "we introduce a renormalisation scheme for the light - light axial current by demanding that the renormalised ratio @xmath31 satisfies the current algebra relations at @xmath32 .",
    "the static - light axial current requires a scale dependent renormalisation , and we define a renormalised ratio @xmath33 by imposing the matching condition @xmath34 the renormalised ratios are expanded in powers of the coupling analogous to equation  ( [ e_xyexpansion ] ) .    at tree level ,",
    "the continuum limits @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be calculated analytically .",
    "@xmath36 contains terms of the form @xmath37 , which are not analytic in @xmath38 .",
    "however , the analytic part can be expanded ; the results at different orders are shown in figure  [ f_treehqet ] .",
    "for @xmath39 the expansion provides a good approximation , and the non - analytic part does not seem to be significant .",
    "[ f_treehqet ]    at one - loop level , hqet predicts that @xmath40 with @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath42 can be obtained as the @xmath43 limit of @xmath44 where it is understood that the continuum limit is taken on the right hand side .",
    "@xmath45 is shown for two different values of the phase @xmath8 in figure  [ f_oneloophqet ] , where fits of the expected form @xmath46 are also shown .",
    "[ f_oneloophqet ]    the extrapolation results are @xmath47 this agrees with a previous result  @xcite , where matrix elements between quark states were used .",
    "turning the argument around , this means that using the @xmath48 value from  @xcite , hqet describes the heavy quark limit of qcd , independent from the chosen correlation functions . to our knowledge , this is the first time that this fact has been established in an explicit example .",
    "a further interesting point to study is the quark mass dependence of discretisation errors .",
    "we discover that for not too large masses , the discretisation errors both at tree - level and at one - loop order are roughly proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "however , for @xmath50 , the behaviour of discretisation errors changes completely .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f_discerr ] , where @xmath51 is shown both in the continuum limit and at finite lattice spacing @xmath52 .",
    "a closer look shows that this behaviour originates from a breakdown of @xmath53 improvement when the quark mass in lattice units becomes too large , as it was previously observed in a perturbative analysis of the schrdinger functional coupling  @xcite .",
    "this means that extrapolations in the quark mass should be carried out in the continuum limit rather than at finite lattice spacing .",
