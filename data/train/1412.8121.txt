    "exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell system are of vital importance in a variety of applications in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the electric charge plays a crucial role in the equilibrium of large bodies which can possibly halt gravitational collapse .",
    "the challenge in astrophysics is to find stable equilibrium solutions for charged fluid spheres , and to construct models of various astrophysical objects of immense gravity by considering the relevant matter distributions .",
    "such models may successfully describe the characteristics of compact stellar objects like neutron stars , quark stars , etc .",
    "one might argue for the occurrence of stable charged astrophysical compact objects in nature .",
    "it is true that all macroscopic bodies are charge neutral or they can have a small amount of charge as pointed out by @xcite , so that the structure of the star is not much affected in the latter stages of its evolution .",
    "however , there are early phases in the evolution of compact stars , for example right at the birth from the core collapse supernova , where charge neutrality is not attained immediately and the presence of the electromagnetic field has been shown to leave a huge effect in the structure of the star .",
    "having said so , note it has also been shown by @xcite that from the balance of forces and the strength of their coupling , this huge charge which can disrupt the structure of the star , however leaves virtually no effect in the equation of state of the matter .",
    "considering the protons as the carrier of the charge in the charged star , it was shown that every extra proton in a sea of @xmath0 baryons , can produce a total charge in the star that will change its structure .",
    "astrophysical compact stars are generally considered to be neutron stars . over the past two decades",
    ", there has been considerable development in observations of compact stars .",
    "although the mass of many of the compact stars are determined with a fair precision , the main problem comes in determining its radius . in some recent papers ,",
    "improved techniques give accurate mass and radius of a few compact stars .",
    "the improved observational information about such compact stars have invoked considerable interest about the internal composition and consequent spacetime geometry of such objects .    as an alternative to neutron star models , strange stars",
    "have been suggested in the studies of compact relativistic astrophysical bodies .",
    "similar to neutron stars , strange stars are considered likely to form from the core collapse of a massive star during a supernova explosion , or during a primordial phase transition where quarks clump together .",
    "another hypothesis is that an accreting neutron star in a binary system , can accrete enough mass to induce a phase transition at the centre or the core , to become a strange star . in the literature ,",
    "there are numerous models of neutron stars and strange stars . in this paper",
    "we use the most widely studied strange star model , namely the mit bag model .",
    "studies of strange stars have been mostly performed within the framework of the bag model as the physics of high densities is still not very clear . @xcite used the phenomenological mit bag model , where they assumed that the quark confinement is caused by a universal bag pressure at the boundary of any region containing quarks , namely the hadrons .",
    "the equation of state describing the strange matter in the bag model has a simple linear form from the treatment of @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that for a stable quark matter , the bag constant is restricted to a particular range .",
    "it is remarkable to note that a strange matter equation of state seems to explain the observed compactness of many astrophysical bodies such as her x-1 , 4u 1820 - 30 , sax j 1808.4 - 3658 , 4u 1728 - 34 , psr 0943 + 10 , and rx j185635 as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a new approach for strange stars by assuming an interquark vector potential originating from gluon exchange and a density dependent scalar potential which restores chiral symmetry at a high density . in the @xcite formulation ,",
    "the equation of state can also be approximated to a linear form .",
    "if pulsars are modelled as strange stars , the linear equation of state appears to be a feature in the composition of such objects as established in the analysis of @xcite . for a given central density or pressure ,",
    "the conservation equations can be integrated to compute the macroscopic features such as the mass and the radius of the star .    in situations where the densities inside the star are beyond nuclear matter density",
    ", the matter anisotropy can play a crucial role , as the conservation equations are modified .",
    "@xcite suggested the consideration of anisotropy in modelling strange stars in the presence of strong electric field .",
    "the analysis of static spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid spheres is important in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "since the first study of @xcite there has been much research in the study of anisotropic relativistic matter in general relativity .",
    "it has been pointed out that nuclear matter may be anisotropic in high density ranges of order @xmath1 , where nuclear interactions have to be treated relativistically , originally in the treatment of @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that anisotropy can arise from different kinds of phase transitions by @xcite or pion condensation by @xcite .",
    "the role of charge in a relativistic quark star was considered by @xcite .    in the present work we study the regular exact model of the the einstein - maxwell system found by @xcite by testing for consistency and compatibility with observations in this model .",
    "we use this model to find the maximum mass and physical parameters of observed compact objects , namely psr j1614 - 2230 , psr j1903 + 327 , vela x-1 , smc x-1 and cen x-3 , which have been recently identified by @xcite to be strange stars . in sect .",
