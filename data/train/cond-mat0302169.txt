    "when we cool down a superconductor below the critical temperature , the material enters a qualitatively different state of matter , manifested by quantum coherence over macroscopic distances . because the critical temperature represents a special point in the evolution of the internal energy versus temperature , the internal energy departs from the temperature dependence seen in the normal state when superconductivity occurs .",
    "because for @xmath1 the superconducting state is the stable equilibrium state , the internal energy in equilibrium at @xmath2 is an absolute minimum . hence cooling down from above the phase transition one would expect a drop in the internal energy when at the critical temperature .",
    "this drop of internal energy stabilizes the superconducting phase among all alternative states of matter .",
    "an experimental example of this well known behavior is displayed in fig .",
    "[ loramint ] , where the internal energy was calculated from the electronic specific heat data@xcite according to the relation @xmath3 .",
    "the broadened appearance of the phase transition suggests that the superconducting correlations disappear rather gradually when the temperature is increased above the phase transition , an effect which remains noticeable in the specific heat graph up to 125 k. + understanding the mechanism of superconductivity means to understand what stabilizes the internal energy of the superconducting state . in bcs theory superconductivity arises as a result of a net attractive interaction between the quasi - particles of the normal state .",
    "note , that implicitly this approach is firmly rooted in the paradigm of a fermi - liquid type normal state .",
    "on the other hand , the school based on anderson s original work@xcite asserts , that a strong on - site _ repulsive _ interaction can also give rise to high @xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "the latter models typically require that the material is not a fermi liquid when superconductivity is muted , either by raising the temperature or by other means .      without loss of generality , _",
    "i.e. _ independent of the details of the mechanism which leads to superconductivity , it is possible to provide a microscopic definition of the superconducting state . for this purpose",
    "let us consider the correlation function defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a single electron creation operator .",
    "this function defines two types of correlation : ( i ) the electron pair - correlation as a function of the relative coordinate @xmath6 , and ( ii)v the correlation between two pairs located at center of mass coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the normal state there is no correlation of the phase of @xmath9 over long distances",
    "@xmath10 due to the finite mean free path of the electrons . as a result the integral over the center of mass coordinates of the correlation function @xmath11 averages to zero in the normal state .",
    "in contrast the superconducting state is characterized by long range phase coherence of the center of mass coordinates , implying ( among other things ) that the correlation function averaged over all center of mass coordinates , @xmath12 , is a finite number .",
    "in the weak coupling scenario of bcs theory the electrons have an effective attractive interaction , as a result of which they tend to form pairs .",
    "for the purpose of the present discussion we will assume that the interaction is of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electron density operator .",
    "the interaction energy in the superconducting state becomes lower than in the normal state , due to the fact that the effective attractive interaction favors a state with enhanced pair - correlations .",
    "the value of the interaction energy of the superconducting state , relative to the normal state is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fourier transforms of @xmath12 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "using the bogoliubov transformation the correlation function can be expressed@xcite in terms of the gap - function @xmath19 and the single particle energies @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 this corresponds to the conversion of a pair @xmath22 to a pair with quantum numbers @xmath23 . in the expression for the correlation energy , eq .  [ hi ] ,",
    "the transferred momentum @xmath24 is carried by interaction kernel @xmath17 .",
    "+ starting from a model expression for the single electron energy - momentum dispersion @xmath25 , and the gap - function @xmath19 , it is a straightforward numerical exercise to calculate the summations in eq .",
    "[ gk ] . adopting the nearest neighbor tight - binding model with a d - wave gap , and adopting the ratio @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bandwidth , the correlation function @xmath16 can be easily calculated , and the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ dgkr ] .",
    ", @xmath28 .",
    "doping level : x = 0.25,width=226 ]    we see from this graph that a negative value of @xmath29 requires either ( i ) @xmath30 for @xmath24 in the neighborhood of the origin , or ( ii ) @xmath31 for @xmath24 in the vicinity of @xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding representation in real space , @xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "[ dgkr ] , illustrates that the dominant correlation of the d - wave superconducting state is of pairs where the two electrons occupy a nearest neighboring site , while the on - site amplitude is zero .",
    "+ combining the information of fig .",
    "[ dgkr ] with eq .",
    "[ gr ] , it is clear that the strongest saving of correlation energy is expected if the electrons interact with an interaction of the form @xmath33 where the vector @xmath34 runs over nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath35 is a negative ( meaning attractive ) interaction between electrons on nearest neighbor sites .      to illustrate the predictions of bcs theory for the temperature dependence of the correlation energy and the kinetic energy , we start by solving the gap equation @xmath36 which must solved together with the constraint that the average number of particles is temperature independent",
    "this requires that the chemical potential must be adjusted to keep the thermal average of @xmath37 at a constant value . in the numerical examples of this paper we have adopted @xmath38 corresponding to a hole doping of 0.15",
    "this solution of the gap equation is shown in fig .",
    "[ delmut ] .",
    "notice , that the temperature dependence of the chemical potential follows closely the experimental observations reported for y123 in ref .",
    "@xcite + to check that the band - parameters used here are reasonable , we display in fig .",
    "[ einternal ] the corresponding prediction for the specific heat and the internal energy , using the same parameters as for fig .",
    "[ delmut ] . if we compare this to fig .",
    "[ loramint ] , we see that the band - parameters adopted here quantitatively reproduce the observed specific heat .",
    "hence the present set of band - parameters ( @xmath39,@xmath40 ) and the coupling parameter @xmath35 represent the best phenomenological choice for quantitative testing of the bcs - model .",
    "the bcs prediction for the temperature dependence of the average interaction energy follows from eq .",
    "we then use the bcs variational wave - function for the statistical average of eq .",
    "[ gk ] , resulting in @xmath41 simultaneously there is an increase of the kinetic energy @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ energyt ] this is displayed , using the same parameters as for fig .",
    "[ delmut ] .",
    "a measure of the kinetic energy is provided by the following relation@xcite @xmath43 where the high frequency limit indicates that the integral should include only the intra - valence band transitions , and the condensate peak at @xmath44 if the material is a superconductor .",
    "the integral over negative and positive frequencies ( note that @xmath45 ) avoids ambiguity about the way the spectral weight in the condensate peak should be counted . if the band structure is described by a nearest neighbor tight - binding model , eq .",
    "[ fsum2 ] leads to the simple relation @xmath46 hence in the nearest neighbor tight - binding limit the _ partial _ f - sum provides the _ kinetic energy _",
    "contribution , which depends both on the number of particles and the hopping parameter @xmath39@xcite .",
    "however , if the band - structure has both nearest neighbor hopping and next nearest neighbor hopping , eq .  [ fsum4 ] is not an exact relation , and instead eq .  [ fsum2 ] should be compared directly to the experiments . in fig .",
    "[ swth ] we compare the spectral weight , calculated directly using eq .  [ fsum2 ] to the result of eq .",
    "[ fsum4 ] , using the same parameters as for fig .",
    "[ delmut ] .",
    "note that the kinetic energy has to be divided by a factor two , as we are interested in the projection along one of the two axes in the ab - plane , which can be compared directly to the experimental value of @xmath47 . from fig .",
    "[ swth ] we can conclude , that the effect of including @xmath40 in the calculation is rather small , and it is still ok to identify @xmath47 with the kinetic energy apart from a minus sign .",
    "in two recent experimental papers measurements of @xmath47 in bi2212 have been reported @xcite .",
    "the values of the kinetic energy change in the superconducting state were in quantitative agreement with each other , and both papers arrived at the same conclusion : contrary to the bcs prediction , the kinetic energy of the superconducting state is _ lower _ than in the normal state ( taking into account a correction for the temperature trends of the normal state ) . in fig .",
    "[ swexp ] the data of ref .",
    "@xcite have been reproduced . comparing this with the bcs prediction",
    "clearly demonstrates the large qualitative discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "clearly the type of mechanism assumed in bcs theory is not at work here .",
    "the trend seen in the experimental data has been predicted by hirsch in 1992@xcite .",
    "the model assumption made by hirsch was , that the hopping probability of a single hole between two sites becomes larger if one of the two sites is already occupied by a hole .",
    "although this model provides good qualitative agreement with the optical experiments , it has one serious deficiency : it also predicts s - wave symmetry for the order parameter , in sharp contrast to a large body of experimental data which show that the superconducting gap in the cuprates has d - wave symmetry .",
    "+ in a recent set of calculations based on the hubbard model , jarrell et al@xcite obtained a similar effect as seen in our experiments , both for underdoped and optimally doped samples . crudely speaking the mechanism",
    "is believed due to the frustrated motion of single carriers in a background with short - range ( rvb - type ) spin - correlations , which is released once pairs are formed .",
    "we have made a quantitative comparison between the bcs - prediction for d - wave pairing in a band with nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor hoppping and various experiments , in particular specific heat and measurements of the optical ab - plane sumrule .",
    "we have shown that the bcs - prediction produces the wrong sign for the kink at @xmath0 of the ab - plane intraband spectral weight , while the model calculation is in good agreement with the experimental specific heat data .",
