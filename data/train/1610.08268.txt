    "<S> the decay can be fitted by the gaussian resolution curve with the contribution of the long time component of the biexponential . </S>",
    "<S> this shows , that despite the absence of antibunching , the excitonic photons are more often triggered by the photons emitted by the dressed states , revealing a certain degree of time ordering .    </S>",

    "<S> one can clearly observe that the cross - correlation histogram becomes symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> for the positive delays , the curve is fitted this time with a biexponential decay , with a short time longer than the resolution ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important result , since it indicates that the excitonic photons can herald some photons coming form the dressed states , i.e. the time ordering of the cascaded photons is lost .    </S>",
    "<S> since the photons coming from four different transitions are correlated , there are four contributions to the correlation histograms presented on fig . </S>",

    "<S> this implies that only @xmath44 and @xmath45 are antibunching at @xmath46 while @xmath47 and @xmath48 are bunching . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that for @xmath49 , providing that @xmath50 , the bunching correlation functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be written as follows :    @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath52 or @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 the radiative recombination rate of the exciton ( defined here such as the half of the biexciton recombination rate ) .    in the limit of low excitation power ( @xmath56 ) and for @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> , the correlation function at zero delay , ( @xmath57 ) corresponds to the value of a thermal source . on the contrary , in the high power regime ( @xmath58 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the bunching gets increased ( @xmath59 ) showing a higher degree of correlation between the emission of the paired photons , symmetrizing the overall measured correlation function @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> the full calculated correlation function is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) and ( d ) . in the low power regime ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) , calculated for @xmath61 ) the dressed states are weakly populated and the probability that a dressed state triggers an excitonic photon is higher than the opposite . this leads to a weaker bunching contribution of the @xmath62 correlations on the positive delays and the resulting correlation function is non symmetric . on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( d ) , the correlation function is calculated for a stronger driving field ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a steeply rising bunching occurs on the postive delays side , since the dressed state become populated more efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> the excitonic photons are also triggering the dressed states photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the establishement of the dressed state ladder , with the dressed states @xmath17 and @xmath16 acting as initial and final states of the cascaded transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetrization of the correlation function was already observed between the sidebands of the single exciton mollow triplet in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .    in fig . </S>",

    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( a ) shows the correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath4 photons for @xmath64 . in this power regime , the dressed states are efficiently prepared by the coherent driving field . it shows a bunching for both sides ( as calculated from the theory , on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( c ) , @xmath59 ) revealing that they are forming photon pairs without time ordering , each of the photons , coming from the dressed states or from @xmath15 , being able to trigger the other one . hence , by post - selecting the corresponding transitions , involving the same dressed state as an initial state and as a final state ( for example @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) , one can remove the time ordering of the cascaded photons . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( c ) presents the same calculated correlation function and confirms the loss of time - ordering under high power ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( b ) shows the correlation between the @xmath6 and @xmath5 photons in the same high power regime ( @xmath64 ) . </S>",
    "<S> negative delays correspond to the time arrival of the @xmath65 photons after the triggering of the @xmath4 photons . </S>",
    "<S> the curve is again fitted by a double exponential ( @xmath37 and @xmath66 ) . on the positive side , where the @xmath65 photons trigger and the @xmath4 photons stop the measurement , </S>",
    "<S> the data are fitted by the setup resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that after the transition from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , the system can not emit immediately an @xmath4 photon and needs to be repumped to the @xmath17 state . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a time ordering of the cascaded @xmath4-@xmath7 photons . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( d ) , an antibunching is here theoretically expected but could not be measured because of the limited setup resolution ( in comparison to the very short repumping time ) and possibly to some unwanted contribution from the @xmath7 and @xmath4 strongly correlated respectively to @xmath4 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this way , the time ordering removed by the post selection of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 photons can be reintroduced by selecting lines involving different dressed states ( for example @xmath4 and @xmath7 ) .    in conclusion , we demonstrated the coherent control over a three - level ladder system and evidenced the 2-photon oscillation of its dressed states in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the strong coupling to the laser field induces a removal of the photon ordering or its conservation , depending on which dressed states are chosen as initial and final states . providing that the quantum dot photons can be detected in both polarization components , the time reordering of the photons </S>",

    "<S> it can also be applied to the generation of entangled photons through a resonant cavity mode under resonant excitation @xcite . in the field of quantum communication </S>",
    "<S> , it could be directly used in order to enlarge the success probability of quantum teleportation of photonic qubits generated with qds @xcite .    </S>",
