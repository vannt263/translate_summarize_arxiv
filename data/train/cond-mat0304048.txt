    "the phase behavior of polymer - solvent systems has important application in the industry for the production and processing of many kinds of plastic materials @xcite .",
    "an example is the formation of solid polystyrene foams @xcite .",
    "in addition , both the understanding of the equilibrium phase diagram of these systems and the kinetic mechanism of phase separation are challenging problems of statistical mechanics . on the one hand ,",
    "variation of the molecular weight of the polymer ( i.e. the `` chain length '' of the flexible linear macromolecule , n ) offers a control parameter that leaves intermolecular forces invariant , and hence allows a more stringent test of the theory than would be possible for small molecule systems . on the other hand , it is crucial to take the compressibility of the system fully into account , since for practical reasons one normally wishes to use supercritical fluids ( e.g. ,  co@xmath0 ) as a solvent @xcite",
    ". then small changes of the pressure result in a large variation of the solvent density , and this fact obviously facilitates applications . while for an incompressible polymer solution ( as it is modelled , for instance , by the well - known flory - huggins lattice theory @xcite ) the early stages of phase separation can only be studied if one realizes a rapid temperature quench from a state in the one phase region into the miscibility gap ( cf .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , for compressible polymer solutions it is possible to induce phase separation by an ( experimentally much more convenient ) pressure jump ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . of course , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have made the tacit assumption that including the pressure does not change the qualitative form of the phase diagram , i.e. , the point ( @xmath1 ) in @xmath2-space becomes a line @xmath3 or , expressed in the appropriate inverse functions , @xmath4 , respectively ( fig .  [",
    "fig1]b ) . in reality , the situation is more complicated , since one must treat both the densities of co@xmath0 and hexadecane as two coupled order parameters , which both play a crucial role in the possible phase transitions ( remember that for the pure solvent at its critical point gas - liquid phase separation starts ) . as a result , it can happen that both gas - liquid and liquid - liquid phase separation are present in the phase diagram , leading to the occurrence of a triple line ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed below , the presence of the triple line has a profound influence on the interface properties and hence the nucleation behavior in the system .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a study of the early stages of phase separation kinetics in such systems by computer simulation .",
    "we use a coarse - grained model for mixtures of hexadecane and carbondioxide as an archetypical example .",
    "the reason for the choice of this particular system is the fact that recently extensive experiments on nucleation in this system have been performed @xcite . in sec .  2",
    ", we shall briefly describe the model and the simulation techniques .",
    "presents the relevant static equilibrium properties , in particular , the phase diagram and the properties of planar interfaces separating coexisting phases .",
    "4 describes simulations of quenching experiments under different conditions , that lead either to nucleation and growth or spinodal decomposition . sec .",
    "5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "a fully atomistic simulation of mixtures of hexadecane ( c@xmath5 h@xmath6 ) and carbondioxide ( co@xmath0 ) , which aims at both establishing phase diagrams as a function of the three variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the study of phase transition kinetics under various conditions , would be an extremely formidable problem . the potentials for the length of the covalent bonds in these molecules ( as well as the potentials for bond angles ) are very stiff . hence , an extremely short time step ( of the order of about 1 fs ) would be required in a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation . in a corresponding monte carlo ( mc )",
    "simulation only very small random displacements of atoms would be admissible .",
    "thus , for liquid alkanes it is a quite common and well - established practice to integrate ch@xmath0-groups ( as well as the ch@xmath9 end groups ) into `` united atoms '' @xcite , and also to work with a fixed c - c bond length .",
    "these simplifications already reduce the necessary computer time by a factor of 100 .",
    "however , we have estimated that even for such a simplified model computer resources as they are available today still are not yet sufficient . thus it was chosen to simplify the model even further , representing co@xmath0 by a single pseudo - atom , and representing c@xmath5 h@xmath6 by a flexible chain of 5 subsequent effective segments , each of which then contains roughly 3 successive c - c bonds .",
    "all such effective monomeric units interact with a truncated and shifted lennard jones ( lj ) potential , @xmath10,\\hspace{0.5 cm } r \\leq r_c=2\\cdot2^{1/6 } \\sigma \\ ; , \\ ] ] while @xmath11 .",
    "subsequent effective monomers along a chain are in addition exposed to a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential @xcite @xmath12\\ ] ] the constants in this potential are chosen such that the most favorable distance between bonded neighbors is 0.96 @xmath13 , while the preferred distance between non - bonded effective monomers is @xmath14 .",
    "this mismatch is desirable to prevent crystallization at high densities @xcite , which is appropriate for glass - forming polymers @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath15 set the scales for energy and length of our hexadecane model .",
    "since we wish that our model fits the thermodynamic properties of this material in the fluid phase as faithfully as possible , we have adjusted them such that the critical temperature @xmath16  k and the critical density @xmath17  g/@xmath18 of hexadecane are correctly reproduced . in simulations ,",
    "a critical point can be computed by a finite size scaling study of the liquid - gas transition along the lines of the techniques proposed by wilding et al .",
    "a comparison of critical temperature and density in lennard - jones units with the experimental values yields @xmath19 j , @xmath20 m @xcite .",
    "since the description of hexadecane is thus already reduced to a crudely coarse - grained model , it would not make sense to keep all atomistic detail for carbon dioxide .",
    "thus the co@xmath0 molecule is also coarse - grained into a point particle , and we require an interaction potential between co@xmath0 molecules of exactly the same lj form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , but with parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "requiring once more that the critical temperature and density of real co@xmath0 are correctly reproduced we obtained @xcite @xmath23  j , and @xmath24  m. it is clear that this procedure ignores some physical effects , e.g. , the fact that the co@xmath0 molecules carry electrical multipole moments is completely neglected .",
    "nevertheless our model not only describes the gas - liquid coexistence curve of hexadecane and co@xmath0 over a reasonable temperature range @xcite , but also other data ( like the critical pressure , or the temperature dependence of the surface tension near @xmath25 @xcite ) .    of course , the choice of interaction parameters between co@xmath0 and hexadecane is more subtle .",
    "we model the interaction between the pseudoatoms representing co@xmath0 and the pseudoatoms representing three subsequent ch@xmath0 groups again by a lj potential of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , but now with parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it then remains to find an optimal choice for these parameters .",
    "the simplest choice would be the well - known lorentz - berthelot mixing rule @xcite @xmath28 however , when one tries the choice eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) the resulting phase diagram of our model system would be of type i in the classification scheme of van konynenburg and scott @xcite ( i.e. , the critical points of pure hexadecane and co@xmath0 are connected by a critical line of the mixture system .",
    "liquid - liquid phase seperation does not exist and thus there is no three phase coexistence ) .",
    "however , experimentally it is known @xcite that alkane ",
    "co@xmath0 mixtures exhibit a type i  phase behavior only for very short alkanes , while for hexadecane ",
    "co@xmath0 mixtures the phase diagram is of type iii . instead of",
    "a connecting line we rather observe a topology as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] @xcite .",
    "in the ( p , t ) projection of the phase diagram , a critical line emerges from the critical point of hexadecane and does not end at the critical point of co@xmath0 .",
    "in addition we observe liquid - liquid immisciblity and a three - phase line .",
    "when we want to obtain this behavior from our coarse - grained model we must allow for a deviation from the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , assuming rather @xmath29 it turns out that a suitable choice for the parameter @xmath30 which characterizes the deviation from the lorentz - berthelot mixing rule is @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with this choice of @xmath30 was in fact used to compute the phase diagram shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] . however , experimental measurements of the critical line vary considerably and a small modification in @xmath30 rises or lowers the critical line .",
    "details about how such phase diagrams are in fact estimated from the simulation are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for a study of the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) as well as for a study of the interfacial free energy between coexisting gas and liquid phases @xcite the grandcanonical ensemble is used , where volume @xmath32 , temperature @xmath33 , and the chemical potentials @xmath34 , @xmath35 are fixed .",
    "both the particle numbers @xmath36 and @xmath37 of co@xmath0 and hexadecane and the pressure @xmath38 are then ( fluctuating ) observables `` measured '' in the simulation @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows an isothermal slice through the phase diagram at @xmath39 k. this temperature is higher than the temperature of the critical end point where the critical line ending at the critical point of co@xmath0 and the line of triple points ( @xmath40 ) in the ( @xmath41 ) phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) meet . therefore unlike fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] there is no triple point in the phase diagram , and the qualitative features are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . at this temperature",
    "we shall examine the kinetics of the phase separation in sec.4 .    in order to observe the kinetics of bubble nucleation in the vicinity of the binodal we control the undersaturation of the system by fixing the chemical potential of both species . as a starting configuration we use a homogeneous state",
    "equilibrated at a higher temperature .",
    "this situation corresponds to a simulation cell in contact with a much larger reservoir which is held at constant undersaturation . as the number of particles in the simulation cell is not conserved , and the particles do not move according to a realistic dynamics , we do not obtain information about the time scale of bubble nucleation .",
    "the kinetics of phase separation in the vicinity of the binodal is , however , chiefly determined by the free energy barrier the system encounters on its path towards the equilibrium state .",
    "hence , we expect the relaxation path to be similar to a simulation with realistic dynamics",
    ". the most natural choice would be to apply molecular dynamics methods @xcite .",
    "however , if the number of particles was conserved we would need prohibitively large simulation cells for the undersaturation not to decrease substantially even in the very early stages of nucleation .",
    "the simulation of spinodal decomposition took place in the canonical ensemble .",
    "again , a homogeneous starting configuration was equilibrated at a higher temperature and quenched to a state below a critical point of the mixture system .",
    "we only allowed for local monte carlo displacements which should yield kinetics comparable to those obtained in molecular dynamics .",
    "first we return to the phase diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] and discuss their properties more closely .",
    "note that at the temperature chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( @xmath39  k ) we are very far below the critical point of pure hexadecane ( which is @xmath16 k ) . therefore the hexadecane melt ( with some dissolved carbon dioxide ) coexists with almost pure co@xmath0 the composition of which gradually changes from gas- to liquid - like with increasing pressure . in both cases there is almost no hexadecane present .",
    "this is reflected in the coexistence curve which rapidly approaches the co@xmath0 molar fraction @xmath42 .",
    "we have also included the results of an analytical approximation for the phase diagram of our model , obtained from a thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite called tpt1 , developed along the lines of wertheim et al .",
    "it is seen that this theory describes the coexistence curve in fig.[fig4 ] at pressures that are much smaller than the critical pressure @xmath43 almost quantitatively , while the critical pressure itself is clearly overestimated .",
    "of course , such an overestimation of the critical parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 is quite typical for all theories that invoke a mean field description of the critical behavior , as tpt1 does .",
    "a similar analytical study for more alcane - co@xmath45 systems has been performed recently @xcite .",
    "note also that the tpt1 theory readily yields a spinodal curve , which has the standard meaning of separating `` metastable states '' from `` unstable states '' in the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the naive ( mean - field ) description implies that in the metastable region of the phase diagram the initial stages of phase separation kinetics are described by nucleation and growth @xcite , while in the unstable region the decay mechanism is spinodal decomposition @xcite . in systems with short range forces",
    "there is no well - defined sharp spinodal line , the actual transition between both decay mechanisms occurs rather gradually in a broad transition region , and this region is not centered around the mean field spindodal but occurs close to the coexistence curve @xcite .",
    "however , for the quenching experiment performed at @xmath39  k and @xmath46 , where the final state corresponds to a pressure of about @xmath47130  bar , we are so close to the coexistence curve and so far from the mean field spinodal , that classical nucleation - type behavior @xcite should be observable . in order to demonstrate the mechanism of spinodal decomposition , we quenched into the unstable region as defined by the mean - field spinodal ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "classical nucleation theory assumes ( in our case ) the formation of spherical gas bubbles of essentially pure co@xmath0 within a hexadecane matrix . for a quantitative understanding of the free energy barrier against homogeneous nucleation ,",
    "clearly the understanding of the interface between macroscopic coexisting phases is a prerequisite . as discussed elsewhere",
    "@xcite , such interfaces are most conveniently studied in the grandcanonical ensemble in conjunction with a multicanonical preweighting scheme that generates mixed - phase configurations . choosing a simulation box of rectangular shape @xmath48 with a constant @xmath49 or larger and periodic boundary conditions , one generates system configurations where the two coexisting phases are separated by two parallel @xmath50 interfaces ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) .",
    "`` measuring '' the canonical probability of these two - phase configurations relative to the probability of the pure phases is a standard method for the estimation of interfacial free energies @xcite .",
    "the results for t=486 k are shown in the inlet of fig .",
    "in addition , this method can be used to generate well - equilibrated configurations of interfaces allowing a study of the interfacial structure .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows , as an example , two snapshot pictures of such states containing interfaces , one at @xmath33=486  k and the other at @xmath33=243  k. the size of the particles is enlarged ( radii shown are @xmath22 , @xmath13 rather than @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , for the sake of a clearer view .",
    "the temperature @xmath33=243  k is slightly lower than the temperature of the critical point of pure co@xmath0 , and thus the system possesses a triple point where a polymer - rich phase coexists with two co@xmath0-rich phases , one being liquid co@xmath0 and the other the gas .",
    "consequently , when we study the interface between the polymer - rich phase and gaseous co@xmath0 , a layer of the third phase ( liquid co@xmath0 ) intrudes at this interface .",
    "the thickness of this layer is expected to diverge when the pressure approaches the value of the triple point pressure . for higher pressures",
    ", we then have a coexistence between the polymer rich - phase and the liquid - like dense co@xmath0 , similar to the situation that occurs at the higher temperature ( fig .  [ fig5]a ) . at low enough temperatures , where a triple point occurs",
    ", one expects a strong decrease of the interfacial tension already when the triple point pressure is approached @xcite : the interfacial tension between the polymer - rich phase and liquid - like co@xmath0 is much smaller than the interfacial tension between the polymer - rich phase and the gas .",
    "the barrier against nucleation also decreases when one approaches the spinodal from the metastable region .",
    "this fact facilitates nucleation of relatively large droplets observable on the time - scales of our monte carlo simulation .",
    "the animation in fig .  [ fig6 ] visualizes how phase separation in polymer solutions proceeds via nucleation . in the beginning",
    "the system fluctuates around a metastable free energy minimum .",
    "one observes the `` birth and death '' of small density fluctuations in the hexadecane matrix ( displayed as red spheres ) which become visible whenever the blue background shines through the slice .",
    "these irregular voids are too small , however , to lead to an immediate decay of the initial metastable state .",
    "usually the voids also contain a few co@xmath0 molecules ( displayed as small yellow spheres ) . only after some time",
    "lag a void manages to grow to critical size and overcome the free energy barrier which seperates the metastable from the homogeneous equilibrium state . from now on the bubble will grow until it fills the whole simulation box . as expected , the critical void gets also filled with co@xmath0 molecules , thus decreasing the supersaturation of the remaining polymer - rich phase . remarkably , this filling of the bubble does not occur homogeneously : at the interface between the gas and the polymer , i.e. , at the surface of the bubble , the co@xmath0 density is clearly higher than it is in the center of the bubble .",
    "this surface enrichment effect may be interpreted as a precursor to interfacial wetting of the fluid co@xmath0 predicted when one approaches the triple point @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this phenomena is in preparation @xcite .",
    "of course , the observation of a nucleation event displayed in fig .  [ fig6 ] is by no means the first observation of nucleation phenomena by computer simulations : e.g. , already ref .",
    "@xcite contains a series of snapshot pictures illustrating nucleation in the two - dimensional lattice gas model . since then many more elaborate studies have appeared",
    "however , the present work deals with nucleation in a system of industrial relevance , namely bubble nucleation in metastable polymer melts supersaturated with supercritical co@xmath0 . in addition , the nucleation mechanism here is quite nontrivial , since the `` critical bubble '' ( which just has the size to be at the nucleation barrier , where there is a 50% chance of growth or decay ) is characterized by two variables , its size and the number of co@xmath0 molecules it contains .",
    "similarly the interface is described by nontrivial profiles of two variables , the total density and the relative concentration of co@xmath0 .",
    "such a nontrivial coupling between two order parameters has also been predicted by recent self - consistent field calculations based on a qualitatively similar model @xcite . since these mean field descriptions do not take into account the effects of fluctuations , a check by computer simulation methods is clearly warranted .    when we quench to a position below the critical point ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , the behavior is rather different : fluctuations in the relative concentration of co@xmath0 get gradually more pronounced everywhere .",
    "these fluctuations are not localized , however , in the form of identifiable bubbles , but rather form an irregular percolating network .",
    "this is the hallmark of spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "since the linear theory of spinodal decomposition only holds for systems with long range forces in the very early stages @xcite , we do not attempt a more quantitative analysis of this data .",
    "note also that the build - up of these concentration fluctuations is relatively faster than the nucleation of bubbles .",
    "hence the separation of time scales between the structural relaxation and the rate constant of spinodal decomposition is less well established . in the intermediate stages of spinodal decomposition",
    ", we also expect hydrodynamic mechanisms to prevail @xcite , which are not captured by monte carlo moves .",
    "returning now to the simulation of nucleation phenomena , we ask how one can quantify these observations",
    ". a straightforward but tedious method would be to repeat dynamic simulations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] many times in order to extract an estimate of the nucleation rate from the average time it takes to form a bubble or a droplet .",
    "of course , since the nucleation rate is expected to decrease dramatically if the quench depth is decreased slightly , such a direct method works hardly in practice . an indirect method to obtain information on the surface free energy of clusters as a function of cluster size simply uses the final equilibrium states of simulations .",
    "an estimate for the free energy as a function of density can be obtained directly from the probability distribution . in this context special care",
    "has to be taken of finite - size effects to identify regions of densities which correspond to a single cluster @xcite .",
    "if we assume that bubbles ( or droplets ) are spherical , filled with gas and surrounded by a homogeneous liquid of coexistence density ( or vice versa ) , we can assign a radius to each density and hence a free energy estimate to each radius .",
    "[ fig8 ] indicates that the surface free energy obtained this way is somewhat smaller than expected from the so - called `` capillarity approximation '' .",
    "a simple estimate of the free energy is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the cluster and @xmath55 the interfacial tension of flat interfaces as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and derived in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "as a consequence , the nucleation barrier is lower than the classical theory of homogeneous nucleation @xcite would predict .",
    "differences in @xmath55 also decrease with increasing cluster size and distance to the critical point of the mixture . at this point , however , the findings are still somewhat preliminary , and more work will be necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate results @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented a simple model and computational tools which allow us to examine equilibrium properties and kinetics of phase separation in systems of industrial relevance .",
    "we were able to produce a two - component mixture phase diagram with a complete critical line which is in qualitative agreement with experiments . for a system at t=486",
    "k we determined the isotherm and interfacial tension of a flat surface as a function of pressure . in a small animations and a series of snapshots we visualized bubble nucleation and spinodal decomposition for this specific system .",
    "for the first case we found a precursor of interfacial wetting which was also observed on a flat surface in the vicinity of the three - phase coexistence line . finally , we found evidence that for small bubbles the interfacial tension is smaller than expected by classical theory of homogeneous nucleation .",
