    "when a hard parton passes through a medium , either cold nuclear matter or quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , it will lose energy due to multiple scatterings and induced gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "its fragmentation function ( ff ) into final hadrons will be modified as compared to that in vacuum .",
    "one can then measure such medium modification of the fragmentation functions or the final hadron spectra to extract medium properties such as the jet transport parameter .",
    "the modification in general involves suppression of leading hadrons in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) off nuclei or high transverse momentum hadron spectra in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "such phenomena referred to as jet quenching have been the focus of many theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite in the last two decades .",
    "they have provided important information about the properties of dense medium that is created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in the latest survey study by the jet collaboration @xcite ,",
    "fits to experimental data on the suppression factors of single hadron spectra in high - energy heavy - ion collisions at both the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) indicate values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 gev@xmath4/fm at the center of the most central au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev / n and pb+pb collisions at @xmath8 tev / n , respectively , at an initial time @xmath9 fm/@xmath10 for a quark jet with initial energy of 10 gev .",
    "uncertainties in the extracted values of @xmath1 , though much reduced from previous studies @xcite , are still large and arise mainly from both errors in experimental data on jet quenching measurements and different model implementations of parton energy loss .",
    "one of the model implementations is based on the high - twist approach to multiple scatterings and induced gluon radiation @xcite in which one can calculate medium modifications of the fragmentation functions that lead to the observed suppression of final hadron spectra in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "inclusion of multiple gluon emissions can be achieved through a set of modified dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite .",
    "one needs , however , initial conditions for the fragmentation functions at the lowest scale @xmath0 to calculate modified fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath11 of the jet production by solving the modified dglap ( mdglap ) evolution equations . different choices of the initial conditions , which in principle are not calculable in pqcd , contribute to the theoretical uncertainties in the extracted values of the jet transport parameter from experimental data on jet quenching . in this paper",
    ", we will use several models for the initial conditions for medium modified fragmentation functions of a quark jet propagating through cold nuclear matter in dis off large nuclei .",
    "we assess the quality of the @xmath2/d.o.f . of fits using the calculated final spectra of leading hadrons with different initial conditions to the experimental data and extract the best values of the jet transport parameter in the cold nuclei .",
    "within the high - twist approach , one can calculate medium modification to the parton fragmentation functions in dis through higher - twist corrections to the semi - inclusive cross section .",
    "the higher - twist corrections can be expressed in terms of medium modified parton fragmentation function @xcite .",
    "such an approach to parton energy loss through medium modified fragmentation functions ( mff s ) has been employed to describe suppression of leading hadrons in dis , nuclear modification of drell - yan spectra in p+a collisions @xcite as well as jet quenching in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in this description of parton energy loss with single gluon emission , medium corrections to the fragmentation functions can become large enough ( long propagation length in very dense medium ) to make the modified fragmentation functions ( vacuum + medium correction ) negative at large fractional momentum @xmath12 . to maintain positivity of mff s ,",
    "one simply sets them to be zero whenever their values become negative in the large @xmath12 region .",
    "one solution to the problem of negative mff s is to include multiple gluon emissions through resummation .",

    ", one has to provide initial conditions of mff s at a given scale @xmath0 which in principle are not calculable in pqcd . the simplest assumption is that these initial conditions take the form of fragmentation functions in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "this _ vacuum _ initial condition assumes that there is no medium interaction and parton energy loss for partons below scale @xmath0 .",
    "it understandably underestimates the total parton energy loss and requires larger values of @xmath1 to fit the experimental data on jet quenching .",
    "it also gives stronger @xmath16 dependence of the medium modification than the experimental data . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we assumed a model for the initial condition , which is obtained by evolving the vacuum fragmentation functions at scale @xmath0 according to a set of mdglap equations with only medium induced splitting functions from @xmath17 to @xmath0 .",
    "this model for initial conditions , which we will refer to as _ evolved _ initial conditions , tends to overestimate the parton energy loss and our preliminary study shows that it will lead to a wrong momentum dependence of jet quenching in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc @xcite .    in this paper , we will consider another model of multiple gluon emissions below scale @xmath0 , which we will refer to as _ convoluted _ initial conditions .",
    "we introduce a quenching weight @xmath18 to represent the probability of a parton losing a fraction @xmath19 of its energy .",
    "the quenching weight is assumed to be given by a poisson convolution of multiple gluon emissions , each of which is determined by the induced gluon spectrum from a single emission .",

    "in addition to @xmath40 which represents the probability of total fractional energy loss @xmath41 by the initial parton @xmath26 due to induced gluon radiation , we can also obtain @xmath42 which represents the spectrum distribution of the radiated gluons with fractional energy @xmath41 from initial parton .",
