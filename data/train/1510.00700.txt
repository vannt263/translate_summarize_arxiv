    "disorder has a profound effect on transport in quantum systems .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of this statement is anderson localization @xcite , where an increasing amount of disorder can lead to a phase transition from a metallic to an insulating state , even in the seemingly simple case of noninteracting particles .",
    "this phenomenon , first predicted over fifty years ago , has been observed directly in a number of physical systems in recent years @xcite .",
    "another subject where there has been extensive work in recent years is the problem of quantum state transfer along one - dimensional lattices or spin chains @xcite . in this problem",
    "the goal is to transport an unknown quantum state from one end of a spin chain to the opposite end of the chain .",
    "previous studies have for example considered the probabilistic state transfer in a chain with uniform parameters @xcite , perfect state transfer with properly designed time - independent system parameters @xcite , perfect state transfer using externally applied time - dependent control fields @xcite and quantum state routers in branched spin chains @xcite .",
    "one question that has not been investigated in much detail in the literature is the effect of disorder on one s ability to perform perfect state transfer @xcite .",
    "one can say that there are some simple limiting cases and trickier , intermediate cases in relation to this question . if , for example , one has full control on single - spin parameters but there is disorder in the inter - spin coupling strengths , one is able to perform perfect state transfer by using the large amount of control resources to counter the adverse effects of the disorder ( e.g.  by performing a sequence of two - spin swap operations while decoupling the rest of the chain during each such two - spin operation ) . even in this case , where intuition tells us that perfect state transfer must be possible ( and does not involve exponential scaling of resources ) , there remains the practically important question of the minimum time required for perfect state transfer . on an opposite extreme , if one uses a protocol that relies on static hamiltonian settings , e.g.  as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , then one would intuitively infer that disorder will induce anderson localization and state transfer will not be possible for long chains .",
    "an intermediate case is that where one has full control over the parameters at the two opposite ends of the chain , with disorder present throughout the chain . in this case",
    "there are spatial limitations on the control resources , but there are no temporal limitations",
    ". the question then arises whether this high degree of control in the time domain will for example allow one to properly launch a spin wave that carries the quantum state and is able to propagate through the disordered landscape of the spin chain without suffering anderson localization . in order to appreciate this question , one could note here that the problem of anderson localization is usually studied in a control - free setting where the wave packet is assumed to be a generic one by some definition and in particular not prepared for the specific disorder landscape that it is going to encounter . as a result ,",
    "it is difficult to take intuition accumulated from past studies on anderson localization and use it to predict the effect of disorder on systems that are subjected to driving by control signals .    in this paper we present results of numerical simulations on the propagation and transfer of quantum states through a disordered chain with and without control . in the case of controlled state transfer",
    ", we use optimal control theory to determine the control signals that maximize the transfer fidelity .",
    "we find that the control signals can help suppress the effects of small amounts of disorder and enable fast perfect state transfer up to a reasonably large disorder strength , even with a limited amount of control . for large disorder strengths",
    ", however , anderson localization physics eventually sets in and the controlled transfer can not be improved beyond the sequential nearest - neighbor transfer protocol , and in the case of limited control resources the transfer time grows indefinitely . for intermediate values of the disorder strength",
    ", we find large variations in the transfer fidelity for different disorder instances , indicating that different disorder patterns can have drastically different localizing effects , even for the same disorder strength .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] we describe the model system and formulate the problem to be solved . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of our numerical simulations and discuss their implications . section [ sec : conclusion ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a spin chain described by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the on - site energies , @xmath2 are the ( nearest - neighbor ) inter - spin coupling strengths and @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) are the usual pauli operators for the spin at site @xmath6 .",
    "disorder can be introduced into the problem through @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 , and anderson localization occurs in both cases , up to minor quantitative differences .",
    "we shall assume that the control fields couple to single - spin operators , in particular assuming that some or all @xmath1 are tunable parameters .",
    "we therefore focus on the case where disorder enters the problem through @xmath2 .",
    "we use a uniform distribution for @xmath2 , i.e.  for a disorder strength @xmath7 the values of @xmath2 are distributed uniformly between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as our main setup for discussions",
    ", we shall assume that the on - site energies at the beginning and end of the chain , i.e.  @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are control parameters that can be adjusted without any constraints , while all other @xmath1 are fixed and uniform , i.e.  @xmath12 .",
    "the system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicdiagram ] .",
    "spins , nearest - neighbor inter - spin coupling strengths @xmath2 and control fields applied to the first and last spins in the chain . in this system ,",
    "the on - site energies are equal throughout the lattice , except for the edge spins , where the on - site energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be tuned via the control fields.,width=321 ]    the objective of the control protocol is to transfer a quantum state from the first site to the last site of the chain .",
    "the chain is therefore assumed to initially be in the state @xmath13 and the desired final state is @xmath14 where the indices label the different sites in the chain .",
    "the ground state is used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiinitial ] ) because it is typically easy to prepare .",
    "the state @xmath15 , which can be expressed as @xmath16 , is treated as an unknown quantum superposition of the ground and excited states .",
    "there are a number of different scenarios where the assumption of an unknown state arises .",
    "for example , the sender could have received the state @xmath15 as a bit of quantum information from another source or obtained it as the output of a quantum information protocol , and the sender is therefore unable to know the quantum state without disturbing it .",
    "note that the state could be entangled with other parts of the system , and a protocol that transforms eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiinitial ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : psifinal ] ) will similarly transfer any entanglement associated with the quantum state .",
    "the state could also be known to the sender , e.g.  the state @xmath17 or @xmath18 along an axis that the sender chooses but does not reveal to anybody else until a later point in the protocol , and in order to protect this information against eavesdropping any part of the state transfer protocol outside of the sender s location must be designed to work for an arbitrary quantum state .    if we start with an unknown quantum state at the first site with the rest of the chain prepared in its ground state , i.e.  as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psiinitial ] ) , the subsequent dynamics will in general involve complex dynamics in the @xmath19-dimensional hilbert space of the @xmath20-site chain .",
    "since this problem becomes intractable for chains of length @xmath21 , we assume , as is commonly done in this context , that the parameters are in the regime where the rotating - wave approximation is valid .",
    "in other words , we assume that @xmath2 are much smaller than @xmath1 , such that to a good approximation we can ignore terms in the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinchainhamiltonian ] ) that mix states with different values of @xmath22 , and we can use the approximate hamiltonian @xmath23 , \\label{eq : spinchainhamiltonianrwa}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the spin raising and lowering operators at site @xmath6 . under this approximation , the number of excitations in the system becomes a conserved quantity . as a result , and since the global ground state @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 being the ground state of the single - site hamiltonian at site @xmath6 ) does not evolve except for acquiring a simple phase , the problem of transferring an unknown single - spin quantum state from the first to the last spin ( with all other spins starting and ending up in their ground states ) can be simplified to the problem of transferring a single excitation from the first to the last site in the chain , i.e.  transforming the state @xmath27 into the state @xmath28 .",
    "the excitation that is transferred can alternatively be thought of as a particle . in other words",
    ", one has a natural mapping between the spin chain containing a single excitation and a system containing a single particle hopping between lattice sites . in both cases the system dynamics",
    "is well described using the picture of wave propagation . the hilbert space required in order to study these problems is of size @xmath20 only .",
    "the simplification of the problem from a @xmath19-dimensional to an @xmath20-dimensional hilbert space allows us to investigate relatively long chains , well above the limit of @xmath21 when dealing with @xmath19-dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "since the output of the protocol is the state at site @xmath20 , we in principle evaluate the performance of the protocol based on how close the state of site @xmath20 at the final time ( after tracing out the state of all the other sites ) is to the state @xmath15 , averaged over all possible single - spin states @xmath15 . as mentioned above , however , under the rotating - wave approximation the transfer fidelity",
    "can also be evaluated through the probability @xmath29 that the initial state @xmath30 evolves to the state @xmath31 at the final time .",
    "this probability can be expressed as @xmath32    as mentioned above , in our main simulations we shall assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are tunable parameters , with all the other @xmath1 fixed . in this case",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 can be treated as control parameters , and we can use optimal control theory techniques to identify the control signals that maximize the transfer fidelity .",
    "we use the grape algorithm @xcite to obtain the optimal control pulses @xcite . in each such calculation , we search for the control pulse that maximizes the probability @xmath29 .",
    "the idea is to perform these calculations for a few different values of the pulse time .",
    "the probability @xmath29 increases from zero at very short pulse times to values that are essentially equal to unity for pulse times that are equal to or larger than the minimum perfect - transfer time @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this time as @xmath33 .    in all of the calculations presented here , we consider chains containing fifty sites .",
    "we divide the total pulse time @xmath34 into 200 time steps @xcite .",
    "we perform the grape algorithm with up to 4000 iterations , although in most cases the fidelity saturated and stopped increasing within the first few hundred iterations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that each pulse that we find using this technique is optimized for the particular set of parameters in a given instance of disorder and will not be optimal for other instances with the same disorder strength .",
    "these instance - specific optimized pulses are relevant in cases where the disorder is static , e.g.  disorder related to defects that appear during the fabrication of a device but do not change in time .",
    "it is crucial to note in this context that the coupling strengths in the chain can be measured using access to only the ends of the chain @xcite , such that it is not unrealistic to assume that one has access to only the edges of the chain but is nevertheless able to have knowledge about the values of @xmath2 for the entire chain .",
    "it is also crucial to note that the optimized pulses are independent of the quantum state that is transferred across the chain .",
    "a natural reference point that is useful to set at this point is the time that it takes to transfer a state from one end of the chain to the opposite end using a sequence of swap operations , one step at a time .",
    "each such swap operation takes @xmath35 , such that the transfer across the entire chain of length @xmath20 takes a total time of @xmath36 in the absence of disorder and with full control over all @xmath1 , one can perform the state transfer more quickly by tuning the parameters in such a way that one launches a spin wave that traverses the chain at the maximum possible wave speed ( keeping in mind that in such discrete systems there is a maximum propagation speed set by @xmath37 ) , leading to the result that @xmath38 in the limit of an infinitely long chain ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : setup ] , the probability @xmath29 of successful transfer of a single excitation across the chain is a good measure of the transfer fidelity for an unknown quantum state , and we shall use this probability in our analysis below . more specifically , we assume that at the initial time an excitation is localized at the first site in the chain , and we investigate the probability that the excitation will be found at the last site in the chain at the end of a given pulse time .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : probabilityasfunctionoftime ] we plot @xmath29 as a function of pulse time @xmath34 for a few different instances of disorder with varying disorder strength in the case where control fields are applied to only the first and last sites in the chain . as would be expected",
    ", @xmath29 increases from zero at small values of @xmath34 to unity at a value that defines the minimum perfect - transfer time @xmath33 , and it remains equal to unity for larger values of @xmath34 @xcite . for @xmath39 , where the disorder is weak , @xmath29 jumps from almost zero at pulse time @xmath40 to almost unity at @xmath41 , which means that @xmath33 is close to @xmath42 , the limiting value in the case of vanishing disorder strength and full control over the on - site energies .",
    "even at @xmath43 , the disorder does not seem to cause much slowing down of the transfer and the different instances of disorder do not lead to large variations in @xmath33 . only one out of five disorder instances in this case ( magenta triangles ) seems to give a transfer probability that is consistently higher than those in the other four instances , and the difference is rather small .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xmath33 is now close to @xmath44 , which is a factor of @xmath45 slower than that obtained in the absence of disorder .",
    "a more dramatic change occurs when we increase the disorder strength @xmath7 to 0.5 . in three out of five disorder instances",
    ", @xmath33 is still around @xmath44 , but in one instance there is a slowing down by a factor of two and in another instance the transfer seems to slow down by at least an order of magnitude .",

    "we therefore perform further calculations focusing on this value of @xmath34 as a way to get a simple but rather reliable indicator for @xmath33 . in fig .",

    "as we shall see below , the disorder strength range where the probability drops from high to low ( i.e.  between 0.5 and 0.7 , roughly speaking ) is related to the range where the anderson localization length becomes much smaller than the chain length .",
    "the above results indicate that the spatially constrained but temporally unconstrained control that is applied to the two edges of the chain is successful in suppressing the localizing effects of disorder for small values of the disorder strength , but it eventually fails for strong disorder .",
    "a possible intuitive explanation for this phenomenon is that for weak disorder a wave packet ( or at least part of it ) is able to propagate the full length of the chain , and the control fields are then able to ensure that the full amplitude of the wave packet is collected at the last site in the chain at the end of the pulse ( with a pulse time that grows only linearly with chain length ) .",
    "for strong disorder , the wave packet can not reach the end of the chain , and at least as far as the last site of the chain is concerned there is nothing that the control fields can do in order to catch the wave packet there .    in order to identify more clearly the role of the control pulses in countering the localizing effects of disorder",

    "this situation is somewhat similar to that encountered in the context of quantum repeaters , where one has multiple communication stations located at properly chosen locations between two communicating parties , such that the distance from each station to the next one is sufficiently small that quantum information can be exchanged efficiently between the two parties located at opposite ends of the setup .",
    "the results of our calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : probabilityasfunctionofdisorderstrengthwithintermediatesitecontrol ] . in the first set of calculations",
    ", we consider the situation where control fields are applied to two intermediate sites in addition to the edge sites .",
    "the largest gains obtained with the enhanced control resources are seen between @xmath50 and @xmath78 , which is the range where the transfer probability with only edge control drops from near unity to near zero .",
    "the gains start shrinking for stronger disorder , however , and for @xmath52 one hardly gains any increase in the transfer probability .",
    "when we increase the number of controlled sites from four to eight , meaning that the distance between each controlled site and the next one is only seven sites , the improvement is enhanced further .",
    "the transfer probability is now very high in all instances up to @xmath51 , and even at @xmath78 the transfer probability is higher than 0.9 in the majority of the instances .",
    "although we now see a clear enhancement at @xmath52 compared to the cases with fewer controlled sites , with a fidelity above 95% in two of the ten instances , the transfer probability still shows a clear tendency to drop towards zero as we approach @xmath66 .     as a function of disorder strength @xmath7 for the case where all the on - site energies are tunable and treated as control variables . each point in the figure",
    "is a plot over five disorder instances used in the calculations for fig .",
    "[ fig : probabilityasfunctionofdisorderstrength].,width=321 ]    finally we perform calculations where we determine the minimum perfect - transfer time @xmath33 in the case where control fields are applied to all the on - site energies in the chain . as mentioned above , in the absence of disorder and in the limit of an infinitely long chain , @xmath38 .",
    "our numerical calculations with @xmath71 give @xmath79 .",
    "the 15% difference with the theoretical formula can be attributed to a combination of finite - size effects ( i.e.  the finite length of the chain ) , a slightly early termination of the search algorithm ( noting here that the algorithm exhibits slow convergence when it approaches the maximum transfer probability ) and the finite distance between pulse - time values used in our calculations ( which is about 4% ) .",
    "we performed similar calculations for finite values of disorder strength and calculated the average value of @xmath33 ( averaged over a few disorder instances ) , to which we refer as @xmath80 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagetransfertimewithfullonsitecontrol ] .",
    "the full control over the on - site energies allows one to strongly suppress the localizing effects of the disorder in the coupling strengths up to @xmath81 , after which @xmath80 increases rapidly .",
    "note here that the sequential swap protocol gives a transfer time @xmath44 , providing an upper bound for @xmath80 .",
    "in other words , even for very strong disorder , one can still perform perfect state transfer with a pulse time @xmath48 . obtaining this value",
    ", however , indicates that one is ( almost completely ) unable to take advantage of wave propagation in order to speed up the state transfer and instead has to rely on the sequential neighbor - to - neighbor state transfer protocol .",
    "we have considered the effect of disorder in a spin chain on the controlled transfer of an excitation or an unknown quantum state from one end of the chain to the opposite end of the chain , particularly in the case where the control fields can be applied only to the two sites at the two opposite ends of the chain .",
    "we have found that with optimized pulses one can achieve time - efficient perfect state transfer in the vast majority of disorder instances up to disorder strengths for which the uncontrolled dynamics would allow the excitation to propagate a distance that is only a small fraction of the total length of the chain .",
    "the application of quantum - repeater - like ideas where control fields are also applied to a number of intermediate sites enhances the transfer fidelity , allowing the protocol to give a high fidelity for rather large values of the disorder strength .",
    "however , the usefulness of this approach decreases when the disorder strength exceeds some value that depends on the details of the protocol .",
    "these results demonstrate that local control can counter the localizing effects of disorder even substantially away from the points where the control fields are applied",
    ". nevertheless , at sufficiently high disorder strengths the ability to perform state transfer deteriorates and even with full on - site control one can not do much better than the neighbor - to - neighbor transfer protocol as the disorder strength approaches its maximum value .",
    "we note here that we have only considered static disorder . in practice , dynamical disorder , or in other words temporal fluctuations of the parameters , are also present in many physical settings @xcite .",
    "while it is possible that the optimized pulses in the presence of such fluctuations will differ from those that are optimal in the absence of fluctuations , we believe that it is unlikely that control signals can reduce the effects of an unknown time - dependent noise signal .    in conclusion , our results provide theoretical understanding to the question of the competition between the constraining effects of disorder and the enabling effects of control . with the steady experimental progress in quantum coherence in spins and artificial atoms @xcite and the high interest in constructing spin chains for fundamental investigation and quantum state transfer purposes , it is likely that such systems will be constructed in the near future , which will then allow the ideas discussed here to be tested and applied to achieve high - fidelity quantum state transfer in these systems .",
