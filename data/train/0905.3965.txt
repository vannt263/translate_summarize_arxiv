    "in a fully quantum - mechanical way , the spin boson model ( sbm ) 01leggett87,02weiss,03gri98 is a prominent physical model in the research of dynamics and decoherence for numerous physical and chemical processes . due to its advantage in the quantitative description of quantum bit ( qubit ) ,",
    "the sbm has drawn wide interest in the quantum mechanics field . in the last decade , many promising scalable solid - state qubit schemes have been proposed and realized @xcite . since controlling decoherence is the dominating strategy in solid - state qubit 07decoherence99,08decoherence02 , qubit can be designed to be coupled to a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) or detector instead of the dissipative environment in order to minimize the decoherence . the ho",
    "is coupled further to the environment @xcite , which is usually characterized by an ohmic spectral density @xmath0 .",
    "such a qubit - ho - environment proposal can be realized as : a flux - qubit read out by a dc - squid @xcite or a qubit placed in a leaky cavity @xcite .",
    "since we usually only need to consider two primal states in the qubit and the environment is characterized by the ohmic bath , as an alternative but equivalent point of view , such a qubit - ho - environment model can be exactly mapped to the sbm with a lorentzian structured bath @xmath1 ( see ( [ j(omega ) ] ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) @xcite .",
    "different from the ohmic bath , the equilibrium dynamics of the sbm with such a structured bath or the equivalent qubit - ho - environment model is rarely studied in the papers , such as the studies on a driven qubit coupled to a structured environment by grifoni et al .",
    "however , this paper is interested in the regime with static bias and typical studies include the quasi - adiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) 17thorwart04 , the van vleck perturbation theory together with a born - markov master equation ( vvbm ) @xcite , the flow equation renormalization ( fer ) @xcite , the non - interacting blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite , an approximation scheme by introducing a ho displacement operator @xcite and the perturbation method based on unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "it s known that quapi is mainly numerical and it is restricted to finite temperature @xcite .",
    "vvbm works well with finite bias at low temperature and ref .",
    "@xcite is a nice and physically clear work .",
    "however , since vvbm uses the van vleck perturbation theory up to the second order in the qubit - ho coupling to get the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the non - dissipative qubit - ho system and solves a born - markov master equation for the reduced density matrix in the qubit - ho s eigenbasis , it requires a small qubit - ho coupling and a born - markov approximation @xcite . to our knowledge , fer has not studied the non - equilibrium dynamics and it needs to choose extra setting parameters for its best results @xcite . until now , niba is not applicable for non - zero bias at low temperature @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents only results for zero bias near resonance , meanwhile , ref .",
    "@xcite with one unitary transformation only presents results for zero bias as well .    in this paper , as an extension to huang and zheng s work 22huang08,22zheng04 , a new analytical approach , beyond rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , based on two unitary transformations and the non - markovian master equation for the density operator , is applied to treat the biased spin boson model ( sbm ) with a lorentzian structured bath for arbitrary detunings at zero temperature .",
    "one should note that the two unitary transformations are different from ref . @xcite and it makes our approach applicable both for non - zero bias and zero bias .",
    "moreover , within a nontrivial born approximation  but without markovian approximation , we get the analytical density operator by the master equation method , which can easily be extended to finite temperature comparing with ref .",
    "our approach has several advantages .",
    "first , both the localized - delocalized transition point @xmath2 and the coherent - incoherent transition point @xmath3 are studied , which have not been provided so far ( except @xmath3 with zero bias by ref .",
    "22huang08 ) .",
    "second , it works well for a wide parameter range : having no direct restriction on the qubit - ho coupling , both for biased and unbiased , at arbitrary finite detunings ( positive / negative detunings or on resonance ) and with sufficient strong spin - bath coupling as long as @xmath4 , which is little - studied and beyond the weak coupling regime .",
    "our results are checked in the exactly solvable special cases .",
    "the dynamics and the corresponding spectrum are compared to the literature results both for unbiased and biased cases .",
    "the shiba relation and the sum rule have also been examined .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "1 shows numerical results of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath96 . for larger @xmath22 ( eg .",

    "while for smaller @xmath101 ( eg .",
    "@xmath102 ) , @xmath5 gradually goes to zero , and we set the cutting at the value @xmath103 , which is small enough .    a phase diagram of the delocalized - localized transition point @xmath2 vs. bias @xmath12 is plotted in fig .",

    "the area of @xmath107 is called the localized phase , and the area of @xmath108 the delocalized phase .",

    "the change of @xmath2 is remarkable for larger @xmath22 or smaller @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , one way by applying a small bias to the qubit can be used to read out the already localized qubit state , since it will greatly increases @xmath2 and the qubit will be shifted from the localized state to the delocalized one .",

    "<S> a new analytical approach , beyond rotating wave approximation , based on unitary transformations and the non - markovian master equation for the density operator , is applied to treat the biased spin boson model with a lorentzian structured bath for arbitrary detunings at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> compared to zero bias , we find that the dynamics demonstrates two more damping oscillation frequencies and one additional relaxation frequency for non - zero bias , where one of the damping oscillation frequencies is a new effect . </S>",
