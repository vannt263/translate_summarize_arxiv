    "we report on _ spitzer _ irs spectrophotometry of 72 3c radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "our survey of a complete ( redshift @xmath2 and @xmath3 jy ) sample of 52 fanaroff and riley ( fr ) type ii ( edge - brightened ) radio galaxies and quasars has been published @xcite .",
    "we are conducting a complementary survey of 20 lower luminosity ( @xmath4 ) fr i radio galaxies to determine the nature of their central engines .",
    "low resolution spectra of fr i radio galaxies were taken with an exposure time of 480 - 1440 s per spectral order .",
    "radio galaxies show a wide variety of mid - ir spectral features and can be classified by the strength of those features ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    broad - line radio galaxies ( and quasars ) such as 3c",
    "120 are characterized by high - ionization emission lines , including [ o iv ] , [ ne v ] , [ s iv ] and [ ne vi ] , and strong silicate dust emission bumps at 10 and 18 @xmath5 m .",
    "the high - ionization lines are powered by far - uv photons from a luminous accretion disk .",
    "the silicate emission is produced by dust out of the line of sight which absorbs a large fraction ( @xmath6 ) of the luminosity from the accretion disk .",
    "though 3c 120 has a relativistic radio jet viewed at a small angle ( @xmath7 ) , the mid - ir spectrum does not appear to contain a large fraction of synchrotron emission .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of bl lac is a pure power - law , presumably dominated by synchrotron emission from its relativistically beamed jet .",
    "mid - ir weak radio galaxies such as ngc 6251 and 3c 270 have low - ionization emission line spectra from [ ne iii ] , [ ne ii ] , and [ ar ii ] .",
    "there is no strong source of uv photons from the nuclei to power higher ionization lines such as [ ne v ] ( at least at a detectable level ) .",
    "curiously , however , there are strong silicate emission features that dominate the mid - ir continuum .",
    "perhaps the agn continuum is powerful enough to warm circumnuclear dust , even though it is not powerful enough to produce high - ionization lines or a broad line region .",
    "in some sources , such as 3c 31 and 3c 293 , large equivalent - width aromatic features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) indicate a large starburst fraction .",
    "any agn contributions to the spectra are difficult to measure because they are significantly weaker than the starbursts .",
    "pah features ( especially at 11.3 @xmath5 m ) are also visible at lower equivalent width in most other radio galaxies ( except bl lac )",
    ". evidently , the radio galaxy hosts are not dead ellipticals but instead contain a rich ism capable of forming new stars .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy is a powerful way to estimate the bolometric luminosities of agns , unhampered by extinction effects @xcite .",
    "the ratio of mid / far - ir emission from 3c quasars and radio galaxies varies by less than a factor of 3 @xcite , indicating very little mid - ir absorption or anisotropy .",
    "however , a plot of @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 shows a range of 3 orders of magnitude in mid - ir luminosity for a given radio luminosity ( fig .",
    "radio jet power is not tightly correlated with accretion disk luminosity , so some other parameter such as black hole spin may be important for driving radio jets .",
    "considering first the fr ii narrow - line radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) in fig .",
    "2 , we see that only 50% have mid - ir luminosities comparable to quasars and broad - line radio galaxies ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 )",
    ". the rest are mid - ir weak , even though they have powerful radio jets @xcite .",
    "mid - ir weak fr iis are a factor of @xmath12 10 brighter in the mid - ir than the average fr i radio galaxy , and may be considered higher - luminosity cousins to fr is .",
    "most of the fr i radio galaxies in our sample ( except 3c 120 and per a ) are mid - ir weak and have no broad emission lines ( fig .",
    "several authors have suggested that fr i jets are powered by extremely sub - eddington , radiatively inefficient accretion flows @xcite . to test this hypothesis , we estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole from the host k - band stellar luminosity and use this together with the ir luminosity to estimate the eddington ratio .",
    "we find that all mid - ir weak fr is ( and fr iis ) have @xmath0 , and no broad emission lines in their optical spectra , consistent with the absence of a luminous , optically thin accretion disk .",
    "roughly 20% of the mid - ir weak radio galaxies have very large equivalent width h@xmath1 emission lines in their spectra ( e.g. 3c 293 , fig .",
    "1 ) . in contrast , very few mid - ir luminous radio galaxies have detectable h@xmath1 emission ( e.g. per a and 3c 433 ) , and the lines have low equivalent width .",
    "we suggest that the h@xmath1 emission is therefore _ not _ powered by x - rays from the agn .",
    "the galaxy 3c 293 is the brightest example of a radio galaxy with strong h@xmath1 emission .",
    "an excitation diagram of the h@xmath1 pure rotational levels indicates a range of gas temperature from 300 - 1400 k. the luminosity of the mid - ir h@xmath1 lines sums to @xmath13 erg s@xmath11 , from a warm molecular hydrogen mass of @xmath14 m@xmath15 .",
    "radio observations of co emission indicate roughly @xmath16 m@xmath15 of cold molecular hydrogen in 3c 293 @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy is very dusty and has a distorted morphology indicating a recent interaction with another galaxy .",
    "in addition , high velocity h i absorption and n ii emission @xcite indicate a strong interaction between the radio jet and host galaxy ism .    because of the rich phenomenology of h@xmath1 emitting radio galaxies , it has proven difficult to determine the primary power source .",
    "it is likely that h@xmath1 is thermally excited in slow ( non - radiative ) shocks in the ism .",
    "these shocks could be from molecular gas accretion from companions or the igm , or jet shocks .",
    "we are pursuing narrow - band imaging and spectroscopy of near - ir h@xmath1 ro - vibrational lines to isolate the power source .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "support for this research was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",
