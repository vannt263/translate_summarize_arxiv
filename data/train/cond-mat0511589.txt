    "the phenomenon of feshbach resonances in ultra cold atomic gases has attracted much attention .",
    "the zeeman - field - driven two - body resonances between fermion pairs in open channels and bound molecules provide a fascinating way to tune the scattering length between atoms in open channels . remarkably , this sort of simple two - body physics results in extremely rich quantum many - body states in atomic vapors which have not been explicitly observed in conventional solid state systems . indeed , by varying the two - body scattering length near feshbach resonances",
    ", several groups have successfully achieved fermionic superfluids in a strongly interacting regime@xcite .",
    "the superfluids near feshbach resonances are related to the bcs - bec crossover studied a while ago@xcite ; this was pointed out by a few groups @xcite .",
    "various efforts have been made to incorporate the two - body resonance between cooper pairs ( open channel ) and molecules ( close channel ) explicitly in the many - body hamiltonian and many interesting results were obtained . relations between the multiple - channel model and the previous single - channel model have also been studied and clarified .",
    "after all these interesting efforts , a very reasonable understanding has been achieved .",
    "three general features of feshbach resonances deserve emphasizing here .",
    "the first one is that near a feshbach resonance the usual cooper pairing amplitude and molecule condensate wavefunction are proportional to each other .",
    "particularly , phases of two components ( fermionic and bosonic ) in the many - body wave functions are completely locked . in most cases",
    ", it has been shown that molecules mediate an effective interaction between fermions .",
    "it also has been emphasized in various occasions that molecules can be integrated out and at low energies one only needs to deal with an effective theory of fermions with attractive interactions .",
    "indeed , in the mean field approximation the feshbach resonance introduces an effective interaction between fermions , the interaction constant of which is @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the coupling strength ( see eq.(1 ) ) , @xmath4 is the detuning energy of molecules and @xmath5 is the chemical potential of fermions .",
    "the second feature is the behavior of many - body states at feshbach resonances .",
    "it turns out that the properties of states at resonances very much depend on the underlying two - body parameters .",
    "if the resonance width is very larger compared with the fermi energy , then at resonances the energy per particle in unit of the fermi energy of free particles is universal , independent of particle densities , or background scattering length , or other microscopic properties of two - body resonances .",
    "it is also in this limit one can establish an explicit connection between the two - channel model currently employed to study the physics near feshbach resonances and the one - channel model studied long time ago .",
    "however , if the resonance width is very narrow , then the properties of many - body states further depend on microscopic parameters of two - body physics .",
    "the distinction between these two limits is even more severe if one zooms in and looks into the molecule fraction or the chemical potential at resonances .",
    "this is the third general feature we would like to turn to . at wide resonances ,",
    "the chemical potential of fermions is still of the order of the free particle fermi energy , while the molecule fraction is actually inversely proportional to the width and is very small . at narrow resonances ,",
    "the chemical potential is depleted to almost zero and the molecule fraction is substantial .",
    "however , in these previous approaches , three important aspects of this phenomenon have been overlooked , and sometimes , miscomprehended .",
    "one is the issue of quantum phase dynamics of bosons and fermions . if we treat molecules and atoms as independent bosons and fermions respectively , there are no particular reasons why there has to be only one condensate phase for two - component superfluids .",
    "in fact , it is natural to assume that the bosonic or fermionic superfluid has its own quantum dynamics .",
    "in fact , a critical examination of the problem suggests there should be two phases .",
    "though in the mean field approximation employed in most of previous works on this subject , the two phases are usually locked , dynamically these two phases do have their distinct features and are never truly identical . the extra phase degree of freedom indicates an extra branch of collective modes which can have rather low energies in the limit of narrow resonances@xcite .",
    "these new excitations are an analogue of small fluctuations of a relative phase between two condensates discussed in ref .. it remains to be studied in details and to be observed experimentally .",
    "the second issue is related to the possibility of having a boson - fermion mixture but with decoupled low energy dynamics .",
    "though this possibility hardly exists in high dimensions , in 1d there can be a phase transition between the usual phase locked superfluid and more exotic phase unlocked states .",
    "the critical point is determined by a sine - gordon type theory .",
    "this was discussed in a recent preprint@xcite and has received further critical examination in a unpublished work@xcite .",
    "the third aspect is the new quantum dynamics due to the conversion between fermions and bosons .",
    "the conversion actually violates the particle number conservation of fermions and bosons respectively and only conserves their total number .",
    "although this violation plays little role in bec - bcs crossover superfluids because of the large local density fluctuations , it can have a vital impact on other many - body states close to feshbach resonances .",
    "one example is the instability of certain mott states when the number conservation is violated .",
    "the other example is the development of a certain hidden order in mott states .",
    "the purpose of this article is to further investigate these issues and explore the consequences of these observations .",
    "a brief discussion on some of these issues was previously presented@xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce a model to study the stability / instability of mott states of fermion - boson systems .",
    "we discuss the validity of the model and the relevance to the physics near feshbach resonances .",
    "in section iii , we exam the stability of certain mott states of bosons when fermion - boson conversion is present .",
    "we show that the conversion leads to delocalization of particles in a mott regime and destabilizes the insulating phase .",
    "a mott state appears to develop a finite density of states at energies well below the mott gap .    in section iv",
    ", we further derive an effective hamiltonian of fermion - boson systems in a large-@xmath6 limit .",
    "we also obtain the equations of motion and investigate the novel quantum dynamics of fermions and bosons in this limit .",
    "general structures of collective modes are studied in a semiclassical approximation . in section",
    "v , we demonstrate that the delocalization leads to superfluidity by explicitly showing the development of the _ off - diagonal long ranger order _ ( odlo ) .",
    "these calculations also indicate that strong repulsive interactions between bosons or cooper pairs do _ not _ renormalize the superfluid density to zero in some limit . in section",
    "vi , we examine the hidden order in certain mott states and point out various topological excitations in mott states . these remain to be explored experimentally .",
    "the model we employ to study this subject is an m - orbit fermi - bose hubbard model ( _ fbhm _ ) . consider the following general form of fbhm @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 label lattice sites , on - site orbits and spins ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 @xmath14 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a fermion at site @xmath8 , with on - site orbital energy @xmath15 and spin @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath16(@xmath17 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a boson at site @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is only one bosonic orbital degree of freedom at each site .",
    "the fermion and boson number operators are , respectively , @xmath18,@xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are hopping integrals of fermions and bosons respectively , and hopping occurs over neighboring sites labeled as @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath5 is the chemical potential of fermions and @xmath4 is the binding energy of bosons which are made up of bound states of fermions .",
    "@xmath23 is the attractive coupling constant in the cooper channel which we assume to be much larger than the rest of couplings .",
    "finally , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the strength of repulsive interactions between fermions and bosons in the density - density channel@xcite(one further assumes @xmath27 to ensure that homogeneous states are stable )",
    ". we only include conversion between a molecule and two fermions in time - reversal doublets , and in eq . 1 , we choose to work with doublets of @xmath28 .",
    "fbhms similar to eq.([fbhm ] ) were previously applied to study bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices@xcite ; most recently an fbhm with fermion - boson conversion was generalized to study the bcs - bec crossover in lattices@xcite . in the absence of the conversion term ,",
    "fbhm consists of decoupled ( attractive ) fermi - hubbard model and bose - hubbard model ; main properties of latter are known @xcite .    in the fbhm",
    ", the conversion is between a molecule and two fermions in the same orbit @xmath9 .",
    "this approximation correctly describes the physics near feshbach resonances at least in the following three limits .",
    "\\a ) the high density limit where fermions mostly occupy high energy on - site orbits . generally speaking , other conversion terms are allowed and the hamiltonian should be h_bf&=&- _",
    "k,^ b^_k f_k f_k^+h.c . , + _",
    "fb(,^ ) & ~ & dx _ 0^*(x ) _ ( x ) _",
    "^(x ) , if we assume the conversion is _",
    "local_. here @xmath29 is the wavefunction for bosonic molecules , and @xmath30 are wavefunctions of @xmath31 orbits at a given lattice site . if @xmath29 is approximated as a constant , thus the selection rule yields @xmath32 and molecules are only converted into two fermions in same orbits . in a harmonic trap where @xmath29 is a gaussian wavepacket ,",
    "one then needs to take into account fermions in different orbits as implied and demonstrated previously@xcite .    however , if orbit @xmath9 and @xmath33 correspond to highly excited states , the conversion between molecules and time - reversal doublets is considerably larger than other terms . this yields dominating contributions in the large-@xmath6 limit . in this case",
    ", the form of the on - site conversion term approaches the form in the bulk limit ; up to a finite size effect , the conversion is between a bosonic molecule and two fermionic atoms in the same orbit because of the wavefunction orthogonality .",
    "the hamiltonian with the conversion between a molecule and two fermions in same orbits thus describes the physics in this limit if @xmath34 takes a large value and the number of fermions per site is big .",
    "\\b ) the low density limit near narrow resonances when non - interacting fermions mostly occupy the lowest orbit . in this case , one can argue that as far as the resonance width is small compared to the spacing between the lowest orbit and higher orbits , the hybridization of molecules and atoms occurs in the lowest energy state ; so fermions remain in the lowest orbit .",
    "one only needs to take into account resonances between molecular states and fermions in the lowest orbit . and",
    "in this case , the fermionic sector of the hamiltonian is equivalent to a negative-@xmath35 hubbard model if one sets @xmath34 to be one .",
    "( see more discussions in section vi ) .",
    "\\c ) the low density limit with magnetic fields not too close to wide feshbach resonances .",
    "the validity in this limit is justified by the following observations . not too close to wide resonances , again",
    "the lowest eigenstate of two interacting fermions in a lattice site mostly involves two fermions in the lowest orbit and a molecular bound state .",
    "this implies that the fermion - boson conversion should again be described by terms such as @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "however , right at wide resonances , the molecule state is effectively hybridized not only with two fermions in the lowest orbit but also with two fermions in different orbits ; this has been correctly pointed out and appreciated@xcite . even in the low density limit where free fermions occupy the lowest on - site orbit ,",
    "the above fbhm hamiltonian when applied to feshbach resonances is indeed no longer valid from this microscopic point of view .",
    "it remains to be understood how many - body physics will be affected by this complication .    without losing generality , in this article",
    "we study the effective low energy theory in a limit where the fermion - boson conversion strength is weak ( i.e. , narrow resonance ) and discuss the issue of mott states instability .",
    "however , we would like to argue that physics discussed in this article would _ not _ be affected by the presence of additional conversion terms when the conversion strength is strong ( i.e. , wide resonance ) .",
    "the main reason is that the form of the long wave length effective hamiltonian described below is subject to severe constraints from the symmetries and hydrodynamics in our problem and has little dependence on microscopics . as far as these extra terms",
    "only renormalize coefficients in equations of motion but do not alter the general form of hydrodynamics discussed in the article , most of conclusions arrived here remain valid even in this delicate limit .",
    "this is evident from a general renormalization point of view but has been unfortunately overlooked in the last two references of ref .. we believe that the significance of extra conversion terms on the long wave length physics has been overstated previously .",
    "in this section , we are going to study a mott state under the influence of feshbach resonances , especially the effect of fermion - boson conversion .",
    "a mott state of bosons or cooper pairs appears whenever bosons or cooper pairs in lattices are strongly repulsively interacting and if the corresponding filling factors are integers .",
    "one of important properties of a mott state is its incompressibility , or a finite energy gap in its excitation spectra , thus a mott state is believed to be robust .",
    "when hopping is renormalized to zero due to repulsive interactions , the number of particles at each site can be strictly quantized and discrete ; particles are _ locally _ conserved .",
    "below we are going to show that in general mott states are unstable with respect to feshbach resonances .",
    "the primary reason is that particle numbers of fermions or bosons involved in resonating conversion are not conserved separately .",
    "so the conversion not only mediates an attractive interaction between fermions as realized before , but also , more importantly violates the local conservation law .",
    "this introduces new low energy degrees of freedom and results in _ a novel mechanism to transport particles_. it leads to delocalization of particles in the limit of large repulsive interactions .    to address the issue of localization of particles , we first introduce the following time - ordered green s functions@xcite @xmath38",
    "now we assume @xmath39 and the number of bosons per lattice site @xmath40 is an integer so that the ground state of bosons is a mott state . without losing generality",
    ", we also assume that the chemical potential @xmath5 is precisely in the middle of the mott gap so that the system is particle - hole symmetric and @xmath41 .",
    "meanwhile , the number of fermion pairs per lattice site is either a non - integer or an integer but @xmath42 so that the ground state of fermions is a superfluid .",
    "we are interested in the effect of fermion - boson conversion on the mott state .",
    "when there is no fermion - boson conversion , one can evaluate the boson green s function by an expansion in terms of the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "for instance , the zeroth order green s function is @xmath44 reflecting the zero bandwidth in this limit .",
    "all low energy excitations are localized and gapped with a single energy @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the number of bosons per lattice site .",
    "the small finite hopping amplitude leads to corrections to this form of the green s function ; following the diagram in fig .",
    "1c , one finds that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the distance between two lattice sites @xmath8 and @xmath47 . to obtain this result ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath40 is much larger than one .",
    "it is obvious that at low energy @xmath48 , the two - point green s function decays exponentially as a function of distance @xmath46 .",
    "eq.([correction ] ) also implies that the localization length at small finite @xmath21 should scale as @xmath49 in the unit of the lattice constant .",
    "the localization of particles in a conventional mott state is largely due to the absence of available low energy states below the energy scale set by @xmath25 .",
    "so to remove a particle at the point 0 and for the particle to travel to the point @xmath8 , one has to confront a sequence of energy barriers of height @xmath25 .",
    "this blockade results in the localization .",
    "when a fermionic superfluid is present and the fermion - boson conversion occurs , there is an additional channel for a particle to travel from site 0 to @xmath8 .",
    "the mechanism is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsfmcon ] . instead of removing a bosonic particle from site 0 and adding to site @xmath8 ,",
    "one can remove a cooper pair at site 0 and transport it to site @xmath8 .",
    "for this , a cooper pair experiences no energy barrier imposed by repulsive interactions because there are sufficient low energy degrees of freedom available for particle - hole excitations in a superfluid . at a latter stage ,",
    "one then turns on feshbach resonances to remove the boson at site 0 by converting it into a cooper pair to fill up the hole left behind by the transported cooper pair ; similarly , the cooper pair transported can be converted to a boson as an additional particle at site @xmath8 .",
    "the net effect is that a bosonic hole is created at site 0 and bosonic particle excitation is now at site @xmath8 .",
    "since the fermionic channel has a long range order , this process therefore yields a long range particle - hole excitation .    at a formal level",
    ", one can study this contribution by introducing a vertex for the fermion - boson conversion .",
    "furthermore , in the weakly coupling limit , the long range component of the fermion green s function reflects the usual off - diagonal - long range order . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "one obtains & & g^f ( ; k , 0)~ ( ) f(r_k ) + here @xmath50 represents other contributions which decay over large distance .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath51 is a constant and is independent of the distance @xmath46 between @xmath8 and @xmath47 .",
    "following the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsfmdiag]d , one obtains the contribution of the boson green s function @xmath52 eq .",
    "( [ green3 ] ) illustrates two important properties of the state under consideration , which are intimately connected .",
    "firstly , the non - exponentially decay component of the boson green s function is _ proportional _ to the off - diagonal - long - range order in the fermionic channel .",
    "the long range component in eq.([green3 ] ) shows that at least a fraction of all bosons actually become delocalized .",
    "the fermion - boson conversion effectively leads to the delocalization of bosons as argued above ( also see fig.[fig : bsfmcon ] for more explicit discussions ) ; it is the delocalization of bosons which in fact induces superfluidity in the bosonic channel .",
    "secondly , the zero energy peak ( at @xmath53 ) in the green s function in the mean field approximation suggests that some bosons should now condense at the zero energy ; the condensation fraction is @xmath54 .",
    "notice that now the resultant bosonic state is compressible .",
    "it is thus implied that there should be additional low energy states well below the original mott gap .",
    "these extra states are one of the consequences of the unusual hydrodynamics in the problem .",
    "we also anticipate that the low energy structure of @xmath55 such as the peak height is to be modified when various fluctuations are taken into account .    in the next two sections",
    ", we are going to analyze the long range order in details . to understand the induced superfluidity , it is most convenient to first obtain an effective theory where the typical issues of broken symmetries can be easily addressed .",
    "so in section iii , we derive an effective coupled @xmath0 quantum rotor model for the fbhm . in section iv , we employ the effective model to examine the long range order .",
    "we first study the _ large - n _ limit where @xmath40 and @xmath57 , the average numbers of fermions and bosons are both much bigger than unity . because @xmath23 is much larger than other coupling constants ,",
    "the ground state of fermions for the on - site part of the hamiltonian @xmath58 naturally should be a bcs state . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the fermi energy as well as the bcs gap are larger than the fermi - boson coupling strength @xmath3 so that we can neglect the fermi degrees of freedom at low energies and obtain the effective hamiltonian written in terms of various collective coordinates ( see below ) .",
    "this suggests that it should be convenient to work with the following coherent state representation , @xmath59^{n_{bk}}}{\\sqrt{n_{bk } ! } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\otimes   \\prod_\\eta ( u_\\eta + v_\\eta   \\exp(-i\\phi_{fk } ) f^\\dagger_{k\\eta\\uparrow } f^\\dagger_{k\\eta\\downarrow } )     \\label{coherent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 are the coherence factors in the bcs wavefunction which minimize the total on - site energy ; @xmath61 is a unity for @xmath62 , @xmath63 is much larger than one .",
    "these states form a low energy hilbert subspace and are orthogonal in the limit which interests us , or @xmath64 is equal to zero if @xmath65 or @xmath66 .    at last , in the coherent - state representation one shows that @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ; or @xmath69= \\delta_{k , k ' }   \\exp(-i\\phi_{fk } ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ \\hat{n}_{bk } , \\exp(-i\\phi_{bk'})]= \\delta_{k , k ' } \\exp(-i\\phi_{bk } ) .",

    "however , when fermions do not have repulsive interactions in the density - density channel ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 is equal to @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the chemical potential of @xmath85 fermions in a bcs state , which is typically of order of the one - particle level spacing at each lattice site . from now on , we will assume @xmath24 is much larger than the level spacing and omit prime in @xmath82    @xmath85 and @xmath40 are functions of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath86 : @xmath87 here @xmath88 . obviously , the detuning energy @xmath4 has to be sufficiently small in order for @xmath40 to be positive .",

    "the effective hamiltonian describes two decoupled sets of quantum @xmath90 rotors in a lattice , the behaviors of which are well known .",
    "if @xmath91 or @xmath40 is a positive integer , the effective model can be used to study superfluid - mott state transitions .",
    "a mott phase corresponds to @xmath90 symmetry restored states and @xmath90-symmetry breaking solutions represent a superfluid phase . for the bosonic ( cooper pair )",
    "sector , the phase transition takes place when @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is equal to a critical value @xmath94(@xmath95 ) ( @xmath96 is the coordination number ) .",
    "the critical values which are of order of unity are usually calculated numerically .    in the presence of @xmath73 , the hamiltonian eq.([effh ] ) describes a coupled @xmath0 quantum rotor model in a lattice . @xmath0 symmetry breaking solutions when both @xmath97 are much larger than unity correspond to a superfluid phase .    in general , the wavefunctions for the many - body ground state and excitations @xmath98(@xmath99 )",
