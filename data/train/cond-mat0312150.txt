    "zero - temperature phase transitions in quantum impurity models have attracted significant interest in recent years in a number of different contexts . in correlated electron materials impurities",
    "have proven useful for investigating the complex bulk behavior , by probing the response to point defects e.g. in a spatially resolved manner by nmr or scanning - probe microscopy techniques . in quantum dot systems , impurity models naturally arise in describing the degrees of freedom on one or multiple dots together with their coupling to leads . finally , the physics of strongly correlated bulk systems can be mapped to impurity models in the framework of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , where a local approximation to the lattice electron self - energy leads to an impurity model supplemented by a self - consistency condition .",
    "interesting transitions , where the zero - temperature behavior of the impurity degrees of freedom changes qualitatively as a function of some control parameter like coupling constants or gate voltages , occur in modifications of the familiar kondo model , which describes an impurity spin interacting with conduction electrons of a metallic environment @xcite . whereas the standard kondo model does not show a phase transition at a finite value of the coupling",
    ", transitions naturally occur when other effects , which compete with fermionic kondo screening , are added . at the resulting transition point ,",
    "the kondo energy scale is suppressed to zero , and the low - energy physics is dominated by critical local - moment fluctuations leading to singular thermodynamic properties and local non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "notably , the physics at these intermediate - coupling fixed points is different from the well - studied multi - channel kondo behavior .    in this paper , we will focus on two routes to impurity phase transitions . the first is represented by the so - called fermi - bose kondo model @xcite , describing an impurity spin interacting with both fermionic quasiparticles and collective spin fluctuations .",
    "the fermi - bose kondo model has recently been analyzed for the case of a metallic fermion density of states ( dos ) , and a gapless bosonic spectrum representing magnetic order parameter fluctuations at a bulk quantum critical point in @xmath1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath2 the model shows an impurity quantum phase transition between a kondo - screened phase and a bosonic fluctuating phase with universal local spin correlations .",
    "recently , the fermi - bose kondo model has been proposed @xcite to describe a `` local quantum phase transition '' in alloys like cecu@xmath3au@xmath4@xcite .",
    "this modelling is based on an extended dynamical mean - field theory @xcite , where the impurity site is coupled to both a fermionic and a bosonic self - consistent bath .",
    "a second paradigmatic model is the pseudogap kondo model @xcite where the fermionic bath displays a pseudogap dos , @xmath5 .",
    "such a bath arises in particular in ordered fermionic systems where the order parameter has nodes at the fermi surfaces , like unconventional superconductors . in the pseudogap kondo model ,",
    "screening is suppressed for small kondo couplings , and a transition between a kondo - screened and a free - moment phase results",
    ". the pseudogap kondo model has been extensively studied by a number of techniques , in particular using the numerical renormalization group method ( nrg ) .",
    "recently , it has become clear @xcite that @xmath6 and @xmath7 play the roles of the lower and upper - critical `` dimensions '' , respectively , allowing for different perturbative expansions to access the physics of the critical point . on the application side ,",
    "the pseudogap kondo effect is relevant for impurities in @xmath1-wave high - temperature superconductors , where indeed non - trivial kondo - like behavior has been observed connected with the magnetic moments induced by zn and li impurities in yba@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested @xcite that quantum dots coupled to interacting one - dimensional electron liquids can display pseudogap kondo physics .",
    "it is apparent that an analytical description of the properties near the intermediate - coupling fixed points is highly desirable to obtain a better understanding of the physics of critically fluctuating moments . in this paper",
    "we shall calculate a number of properties of the fermi - bose kondo and the pseudogap kondo models for parameters in the vicinity of the intermediate - coupling fixed points .",
    "these calculations are based on a perturbative renormalization group analysis of the models , together with renormalized perturbation theory  this allows us to obtain results for observables in the quantum - critical regime where bare perturbation is known to diverge . as in earlier work",
    "@xcite , the expansion is done around the free - moment fixed point ( which can be understood as expansion around the lower - critical dimension of the phase transitions ) .",
    "the small parameters controlling the perturbation theory are the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 occuring in the fermionic and bosonic bath density of states , respectively .",
    "critical properties will be computed in a double expansion in the non - linear couplings of the theory and the scaling dimensions @xmath11 and @xmath13 . in particular",
    ", we will show that the impurity entropy is finite at the fermi - bose critical point , which has consequences for scenarios of local criticality in the framework of extended dmft .",

    "it is straightforward to combine the effects of a pseudogap bath and a competing bosonic interaction onto fermionic kondo physics by considering the pseudogap fermi - bose kondo model , which supersedes the variants discussed above .",

    "finally , we note that in certain impurity problems the real part of the propagator renormalization requires the introduction of a suitable counter - term  physically this reflects the shift of the phase transition point , arising from the real part of a self - energy . in the present case",
    "no counter - terms are necessary .",
    "in this appendix we describe the perturbation theory for the impurity part of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the impurity spin is represented by @xmath118 pseudo - fermions as above , together with the chemical potential in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "we shall illustrate that the correct treatment of this limit has non - trivial consequences for the higher - order diagrammatic expansion of the entropy .",
    "the starting point is the partition function in the physical sector of the hilbert space ( @xmath300 ) , which can be written as @xmath301 here , @xmath302 is an expectation value with the full hamiltonian in the presence of @xmath81 as above , and @xmath303 is the expectation value in the absence of the coupling between impurity and baths .",
    "the above expression is easily understood : for @xmath77 , @xmath304 is the partition in the physical sector times @xmath83 , i.e. , the `` factor '' @xmath305 suppresses the @xmath306 part of the hilbert space .",
    "further , in this limit @xmath307 , and the unperturbed impurity part of the partition function is just @xmath308 for a spin-@xmath36 impurity .",
    "importantly , the limit @xmath77 in @xmath309 suppresses the contributions from disconnected diagrams , consisting of more than one loop of @xmath118 pseudo - fermions , because those are smaller by further powers of @xmath83 .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is given by @xmath310 the partition function ( [ zimp ] ) can now be expanded in the impurity couplings using standard diagrammatics , and then the log in ( [ omegaimp ] ) is expanded to the required order .",
    "there is now _ no _ cancellation of disconnected diagrams in @xmath311 , because those diagrams do not appear in @xmath309  this reflects the fact that we are not expanding around a system of free particles here .    for the bosonic impurity problem",
    ", we have @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the sum of all @xmath314-th order different _ connected _ diagrams ; @xmath315 and @xmath316 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_dgr]c .",
    "thus , @xmath317 i.e. , the expansion for the thermodynamic potential contains disconnected diagrams !",
    "the entropy is obtained from @xmath311 by @xmath318 .",
    "power counting shows that @xmath105 as @xmath185 in the cases where the fixed point value of the impurity coupling is zero ( as is the case , e.g. , in the bose - kondo model for @xmath319 space dimensions ) .",
    "then , only subleading corrections arise from the coupling to the bath .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a finite renormalized coupling @xmath256 or @xmath174 , bare perturbation theory is infrared divergent , as for standard problems below their upper - critical dimension .",
    "proceeding in the scheme of renormalized perturbation theory , the perturbative result ( to lowest non - trivial order ) can be expressed in terms of the renormalized couplings . at the rg fixed point , the couplings",
    "can then be replaced by their fixed - point values , and the result for the entropy is finite as @xmath185 .",
    "the impurity part of the thermodynamic potential diverges with the cutoff , i.e. , we have @xmath320 , where @xmath321 is the non - universal ( cutoff - dependent ) impurity contribution to the ground - state energy . however , the impurity entropy @xmath102 is fully universal , and the uv cutoff can be sent to infinity _ after _ taking the temperature derivative of @xmath311 .",
    "as the perturbative method employed in the body of the paper is restricted to small @xmath322 , alternative approaches are desirable which can provide results for all @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "a dynamic large-@xmath14 approach to the bosonic kondo problem has been developed .",
    "here we shall use this approach to evaluate the impurity entropy at the b - fl fixed point in arbitrary space dimension @xmath1 , which complements the results of sec .",

    "we begin by summarizing the large-@xmath14 theory of ref .  .",
    "the impurity spin symmetry is generalized from su(2 ) to su(@xmath14 ) .",
    "the spin operator is represented by auxiliary fermions @xmath323",
    "( @xmath324 ) , and a chemical potential @xmath325 is introduced to enforce the constraint @xmath326 .",
    "we will restrict the considerations to @xmath327 ; this choice has the advantage of preserving particle - hole symmetry , such that the chemical potential @xmath325 is actually zero for all temperatures .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the natural large-@xmath14 generalization of @xmath328 of sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , where the @xmath52 field now has @xmath329 components ; for details see ref .  .",
    "taking the limit @xmath330 results in a dynamic saddle point @xcite , and the impurity physics is captured by a self - consistent integral equation , @xmath331 where @xmath332 is the local spin fluctuation propagator ( [ eps2 ] ) , and the self - energy @xmath333 is defined by : @xmath334 here @xmath335 is the _ full _ auxiliary fermion green s function in standard notation .",
    "clearly , ( [ ncasigma ] ) represents a summation of all self - energy diagrams with non - crossing boson lines , somewhat similar to the non - crossing approximation known from fermionic kondo physics @xcite . in writing down the above equations we have assumed full su(@xmath14 ) symmetry and dropped the corresponding su(@xmath14 ) indices",
    "finally , @xmath325 is determined by the constraint equation : @xmath336 which is designed to satisfy the contraint @xmath326 on average .    in the following we concentrate on the bulk critical point , @xmath337 , where the bosonic spectrum is gapless , @xmath70 .",

    "thus we have the large-@xmath14 result @xmath346 which coincides with the exact result ( [ exact_etachi ] ) for non - interacting bosons in the su(2)-symmetric bose kondo problem .",

    "the temperature derivative of the above expression has to be taken using the scaling form ( [ gfscal ] ) of @xmath341 .",
