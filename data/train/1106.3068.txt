    "since the first observational evidence associating foreground galaxies with absorption lines detected in the spectra of background quasars @xcite , researchers have strived to determine the relationships between absorbing gas found within @xmath7200   and a few 100  kpc of their host galaxies .",
    "we have yet to develop a complete understanding of the many physical conditions under which galaxies predominantly produce their own metal  enriched `` halos '' or accrete material in their immediate environment .",
    "it is plausible that most galaxies undergo both these processes at some point during their evolution . assuming that clear observational connections between the galaxy properties and the halo gas properties are present in nature , our collective hope is that we can ultimately understand the conditions that drive outflows versus the conditions that indicate accretion ( such as galaxy star formation rates , morphologies , inclinations , etc . , and absorption equivalent widths , kinematics , and chemical and ionization conditions ) .",
    "the mg0.1emii  @xmath8 doublet is commonly used to trace metal - enriched low - ionized gas surrounding galaxies between @xmath9 . however , understanding the origins of this gas is difficult .",
    "absorption traces a wide range of neutral hydrogen column densities , @xmath10   @xcite , which produces a large range of detectable rest - frame equivalent widths , @xmath11   .",
    "the large range in column densities implies that absorption arises within a large dynamical range of structures and environments that contribute to the complex kinematics seen in typical absorption profiles",
    ". it may be that lower column density systems trace a different population of structures and gas producing processes than do higher column density systems .    the first suggestion that halos observed via absorption may exhibit a dependence on galaxy ",
    "quasar separation was a @xmath12 anti - correlation between @xmath3 and impact parameter , @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this could be interpreted to imply the universal property of a radially decreasing gas density profile in halos .",
    "however , given the complex velocity structure of these absorption systems , which is independent of @xmath1 , @xcite argued that the absorption likely arises from a variety of ongoing dynamical events within the galaxy and halo .",
    "the first hint of a connection between galaxy mass and the presence or absence of absorption was deduced from the holmberg - like luminosity scaling between a characteristic halo radius and galaxy k - band luminosity @xcite .",
    "recent studies at @xmath13 restrict the range of the luminosity power - law slope between 0.2 @xmath14 0.5 , the characteristic halo radius between 90110  kpc ( for an @xmath15 galaxy ) , and the gas absorption covering fraction between @xmath75090% @xcite .",
    "however , the gas covering fraction may decrease to @xmath725% by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear what physical processes replenish the gas reservoirs and populate halos with such high covering fractions at high impact parameters .",
    "@xcite analyzed several systems with @xmath17   at @xmath18 and concluded that high equivalent width absorption systems produced by winds is a plausible model .",
    "@xcite found an anti - correlation between @xmath3 and the amplitude of the cross - correlation between luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) and absorbers with @xmath19   .",
    "since the cross - correlation amplitude is related to the halo mass , they inferred that the majority of strong absorption systems are _ not _ produced by gas that is virialized within galaxy halos .",
    "they interpreted the @xmath3halo - mass anti - correlation as evidence that supernova - driven winds become dominant sources of stronger absorbers , i.e. , @xmath20   .",
    "further support for a wind interpretation of such strong absorbers was found by @xcite by stacking sloan g , r , and i band images toward 700 quasars .",
    "spectral energy distribution fits to their stacked images indicate that early - type galaxies are associated with weaker absorption than late - type galaxies , which suggests that star formation rates ( sfrs ) may correlate with absorption strength . confirming these results , @xcite stacked over 8,500 segments of sdss quasar spectra where was likely to be present at the redshift of the absorption and discovered a highly significant correlation between the @xmath3 and luminosity .",
    "they further demonstrated that the distribution function of @xmath3 naturally reproduces the shape and amplitude of the luminosity without any free parameters .",
    "this implies that absorption systems trace a significant fraction of the global luminosity function .",
    "they suggest that star - formation driven outflows are the primary mechanism responsible for @xmath21   absorption systems .",
    "the outflow scenario is further supported by the 5002000   winds observed in the high equivalent width and asymmetric absorption profiles seen in spectra of highly star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite further demonstrated that @xmath3 and outflow velocity correlate with galaxy sfr .",
    "the evidences discussed above for strong systems being produced by star - formation driven winds primarily uses data that have high detection limits such that @xmath22   and it is likely that these conclusions apply to systems with @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25   . in a sample of 71",
    "absorbing and non - absorbing galaxies consisting of predominantly ( 85% ) @xmath26   absorption systems , @xcite do not find a correlation between @xmath3 and galaxy color and suggest a lack of a physical connection between the halos and recent star formation history of the galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the halo size scales with the stellar mass and the specific star formation rate of the host galaxy .",
    "they interpret this result as massive galaxies having more extended halos and that absorption systems arise from infalling clouds that fuel star formation . taken together",
    ", the @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite results may be suggesting that @xmath26-@xmath27   absorption systems are not wind dominated but that larger @xmath3 systems are wind dominated .",
    "studies that incorporate the gas kinematics , galaxy morphologies and galaxy orientations relative to the quasar line of sight over the full range of @xmath3 would be useful to examine these ideas .    @xcite compared absorption and galaxy rotation kinematics of 10 , @xmath28 , @xmath29   systems and found that , in most cases , the absorption was fully to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity and usually aligned with one arm of the rotation curve .",
    "these results are consistent with an earlier study of six galaxies by @xcite .",
    "however , both studies demonstrated that in virtually all cases , a co - rotating halo model poorly reproduces the absorption velocity spread .",

    "@xcite also directly compared the relative halo gas and host galaxy kinematics for 13   @xmath7@xmath30 galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "they found that these galaxies had low sfrs , low sfrs per unit area , and their @xmath32 ( stellar+ism tracer ) and ( stellar tracer ) line ratios implied kinematically quiescent interstellar media containing no strong outflowing gas . given that these host galaxies were in isolated environments and given the relative halo - gas / galaxy velocity offsets",

    "the discrepancy between @xcite and our work and @xcite may indicate that there is a fundamental difference in the galaxies selected by stronger and weaker absorption systems ; weaker systems are possibly not correlated with host galaxy star - formation rates or the luminosity - weighted stacking procedure is not fully understood .",

    "the equivalent widths , and the other measures of the column density , decrease with @xmath1 , indicating that halos exhibit a natural decrease in gas column density with increasing projected galactocentric distance .",
    "this anti - correlation alone can not be leveraged to differentiate between wind scenarios and other gas producing mechanisms ; however , we would expect a difference in the halo gas geometry for the competing scenarios ( see   [ sec : orientation ] and   [ sec : normalize ] ) .",
    "our sample exhibits trends for increasing absorption properties ( and scatter ) with higher inclination galaxies .",
    "accounting for the decreasing gas column density ( and its scatter ) with increasing @xmath1 reduces the scatter and yields a strong correlation ( @xmath2 ) . at the very least ,",
    "this suggests that the combined effect of inclination and impact parameter is such that weaker absorption is found at larger @xmath1 and smaller @xmath64 ( far from face - on galaxies ) .",

    "recent cosmological sph simulations of @xcite have shown that gas - rich mergers and cold - flow streams can produce a circum - galactic cool gas component that predominately infalls towards the host galaxy disk .",

    ", @xcite found that the velocity differences between the absorption and the host galaxies are roughly 16   with a dispersion of 137  .",
    "these velocity offsets are much lower than expected for wind driven outflows .    in fact , a direct kinematic comparison of six galaxies and their absorption kinematics , with velocity offsets similar to those of @xcite , were shown to be fairly well described as having lagging disk - like kinematics , though not all of the velocity spread could be successfully modeled @xcite . however , the discrepancies were on the order of @xmath72   in the most extreme cases . for a similar sample ,",
    "@xcite also showed that , even if the absorption tends to reside fully to one side of the galaxy systemic velocity and aligns with one arm of the rotation curve , not all the absorbing gas kinematics can be explained by a co - rotating halo model . using cosmological simulations , they further showed that even if the majority of the simulated absorption arises is an array of structures , such as filaments and tidal streams , the halo gas often has velocities consistent with the galaxy rotation velocity .",
    "the line of sight gas motions along these structures in the simulations reproduce a velocity distribution consistent with that reported by @xcite .    finally ,",
    "it is also interesting to note the equivalent width redshift path density evolution of absorbers : higher equivalent width systems evolve in that there are fewer high @xmath3 systems per unit redshift at low redshifts than at higher redshifts .",
    "the evolution is more pronounced for the highest @xmath73 ) systems , i.e. , those with 2   and above . as lower @xmath3 systems are examined , the evolution weakens such that for all systems with @xmath74   the absorber population is consistent with the no - evolution expectation for the presently accepted cosmology @xcite .",
    "assuming winds are a transient phenomenon in most galaxies , and given that the global star formation rate of the universe decreases toward low redshifts @xcite , it would seem reasonable that , globally , the higher equivalent width systems have some causal connection to star formation rates . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that lower equivalent width systems do not evolve with redshift would indicate that the processes producing lower @xmath3 , though varied , are fairly constant with cosmic time . though major merger rates are expected to decrease strongly , @xmath75 , with redshift ( cf .",
    "* ) , it is not clear that other scenarios such as minor mergers and/or accretion of the igm ( filaments , etc . ) evolve as rapidly .",
    "it could be that the lack of redshift evolution of lower @xmath3 absorbers is linked to the latter , possibly more ubiquitous processes .",
    "the different physical characteristics and evolution of the populations of high and low @xmath3 systems suggest different physical mechanisms giving rise to each population .",
    "the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for our lower @xmath3 sample indicates that winds do not dominate the lower equivalent width regime .",
    "it appears that galaxy inclination plays a strong role in determining the optical depth of the halo gas once the decreasing column density with increasing impact parameters is taken into account .",
    "we find that edge - on systems are likely to produce higher optical depth absorption systems , and lower optical depth absorption systems are produced by face - on galaxies : this is the opposite effect expected for a wind scenario .",
    "these results support a picture where the absorption arises in structures that are relatively co - planer to the host galaxy disk .",
    "such structures might include accreting filaments or tidal streams from minor mergers in the galaxy plane , and disk warps .",
    "these results are consistent with recent cosmological simulations of @xcite who find that the accretion of cool gas via filaments and gas rich merges does in fact form a stable disk that supplies gas and angular momentum to the host galaxy .",

    "<S> we have used gim2d to quantify the morphological properties of 40 intermediate redshift absorption - selected galaxies ( @xmath0   ) , imaged with wfpc-2/_hst _ , and compared them to the halo gas properties measured from hires / keck and uves / vlt quasar spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the quasar  galaxy separation , @xmath1 , increases the equivalent decreases with large scatter , implying that @xmath1 is not the only physical parameter affecting the distribution and quantity of halo gas . </S>",
    "<S> our main result shows that inclination correlates with absorption properties after normalizing out the relationship ( and scatter ) between the absorption properties and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a @xmath2 correlation between @xmath3 and galaxy inclination , normalized by impact parameter , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> other measures of absorption optical depth also correlate with @xmath4 at greater than @xmath5 significance . </S>",
    "<S> overall , this result suggests that gas has a co - planer geometry , not necessarily disk - like , that is coupled to the galaxy inclination . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that the absorbing gas arises from tidal streams , satellites , filaments , etc . , which tend to have somewhat co - planer distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not support a picture in which absorbers with @xmath6  are predominantly produced by star - formation driven winds .    </S>",
    "<S> we further find that ; ( 1 ) host galaxies have quantitatively similar bulge and disk scale length distribution to field galaxies at similar redshifts and have a mean disk and bulge scale length of 3.8  kpc and 2.5  kpc , respectively ; ( 2 ) galaxy color and luminosity do not correlate strongly with absorption properties , implying a lack of a connection between host galaxy star formation rates and absorption strength ; ( 3 ) parameters such as scale lengths and bulge - to - total ratios do not significantly correlate with the absorption parameters , suggesting that the absorption is independent of galaxy size or mass .    </S>",
