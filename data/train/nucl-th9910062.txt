    "shell  model calculations in complex nuclei make use of the single particle harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis and are carried out in a truncated model space . in the last few years",
    "an impressive progress has been made in the application of these shell  model methods to the study of light nuclei  @xcite . in the so called no  core shell  model calculations one keeps all the nucleons active and , instead of the single particle ho basis",
    ", one introduces ho basis functions that depend on the jacobi coordinates , thus removing the spurious center of mass motion from the beginning  @xcite .",
    "since the ho series has a slow convergence rate one generally has to replace the bare nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction by an effective interaction tailored to the truncated model space . theoretically for a given model space",
    "one can find an effective interaction such that the spectrum of the effective a  body hamiltonian coincides with a subset of the spectrum of the full  space bare hamiltonian . in practice , however , finding such an effective interaction is as difficult as solving the full a  body problem .",
    "therefore one resorts to an approximated effective interaction , usually obtained from the solution of a 2body hamiltonian .",
    "these 2body effective interactions do no longer lead to the exact result in the truncated space , but , if constructed properly , they retain two important properties : ( i ) they converge to the bare hamiltonian if the model space is enlarged up to the full hilbert space ; ( ii ) the energy levels of the effective hamiltonian converge to the exact values faster than those of the bare hamiltonian .",
    "the ho basis functions resulting from a confining hamiltonian do not posses the correct asymptotic behavior of the nuclear a  body hamiltonian . as a result",
    "the use of the ho basis may lead to a rather slow convergence of other observables besides the energy levels .",
    "this limitation can be circumvented by using the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) basis functions instead of the ho basis . in the hh formalism , successfully applied to the nuclear few ",
    "body problem  @xcite , the jacobi coordinates are replaced by a single length coordinate , the hyperradius , and a set of @xmath1 hyperangles .",
    "the hh are the a ",
    "body generalization of the 2body spherical harmonics , and likewise depend only on the hyperangular ( angular ) coordinates in the hyperspherical ( spherical ) decomposition of the a  body ( 2body ) system .",
    "in general , the wave function can be expanded in a series consisting of products of hh basis functions and hyperradial basis functions .",
    "very often the slow convergence rate of the hh basis is accelerated by using correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to investigate an alternative way of improving the convergence . to this end",
    "we reformulate the method of effective interaction for the hh expansion .",
    "the ho and the hh expansion can become equivalent by making a particular choice for the hyperradial basis functions .",
    "therefore a trivial way to achieve a reformulation would be to make the hh expansion equivalent to the ho expansion .",
    "however , by doing so one would loose the extra flexibility the hh basis has in comparison to the ho basis and , moreover , impose an incorrect asymptotic behavior of the wave function .",
    "therefore we renounce to such an equivalent formulation .",
    "there is a further advantage of the hh basis , which is due to the presence of the collective hyperradial coordinate .",
    "eventually it will allow the introduction of a state dependent effective interaction similar to the recently formulated ho multi  valued effective interaction  @xcite . at first sight",
    ", however , it appears that the hyperradius is leading to two problems .",
    "first , its collective feature seems to make it difficult to single out a 2body hamiltonian in a natural way .",
    "second , using a general form for the hyperradial basis functions one may find it difficult to identify a model space in accordance with a 2body effective interaction . in this work we propose to solve these problems by defining a model space that consists of a complete hyperradial set and the set of hh functions with generalized angular momentum quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "the effective interaction is then deduced from an hyperangular hamiltonian associated with the 2body problem .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hh ] we review the method of hyperspherical coordinates and of the hh expansion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : veff ] we derive the effective interaction for the hh expansion .",

    "to introduce the hyperspherical coordinates we start from the center  of  mass coordinate @xmath3 and the normalized reversed order @xmath4 jacobi coordinates @xmath5 where the @xmath6th particle is specified relative to the center of mass of particles @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "the jacobi coordinate @xmath9 consists of a radial coordinate @xmath10 and a pair of angular coordinates @xmath11 .",

    "let us now turn to the problem of constructing the effective interaction .",
    "it is customary to approximate @xmath67 by a sum of two  body effective interactions determined from a 2body problem . as the nuclear 2body system contains only one bound state one",
    "is forced to introduce a confining potential into the 2body problem in order to ensure large overlaps between the model space states and the eigenvectors of the 2body problem .",
    "it will be shown that in the present approach one does not need such an additional confining potential .    using the symmetrized hh basis the matrix elements of the effective interaction",
    "can be deduced from the matrix elements of the `` last '' pair , @xmath68 the relevant hyperspherical degrees of freedom associated with @xmath69 are @xmath70 and the hyperangle , @xmath71 a natural choice for the corresponding hyperspherical `` 2body '' hamiltonian is @xmath72 since @xmath73 contains the canonical kinetic energy associated with the two  body variables @xmath74 and @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ kn ] ) ) .",
    "such an @xmath75 is in fact an a ",
    "body effective interaction as it contains the hyperspherical part of the a  body kinetic energy operator and it is a function of the collective coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "the hyperradial kinetic energy operator has not been included in @xmath75 .",
    "the reason is that we can use a complete basis set for the @xmath17space and therefore we do not need to define an effective interaction for the hyperradial part .",
    "due to the collective coordinate , @xmath17 , in @xmath75 one has automatically a confinement of the 2body  system : for moderate values of @xmath17 the relation @xmath76 ensures localization of the 2body wave function and for large values of @xmath17 the effective hamiltonian coincides with the bare one , since the nn interaction vanishes .",
    "therefore large overlaps between the model space states and the eigenvectors of the 2body problem are ensured .",
    "different from the ho approach we do not calculate an effective interaction for a `` free '' 2body  system but for a `` bound '' one . therefore we can avoid to introduce in @xmath75 the additional confining potential which is necessary for the ho effective interaction and which leads to undesirable features .",

    "the hh effective interaction depends on the state of the residual @xmath83 particle subsystem .",
    "such a `` medium correction '' of the 2body force is of course a great advantage of our approach and is similar to the ho multi  valued effective interaction  @xcite . on the other hand one",
    "has to pay for it with a greater numerical effort , since the effective interaction has to be calculated for all the various states and does also depend on the specific @xmath8body system .",
    "solving the hyperradial equation on a grid , we have to diagonalize @xmath75 for each grid point @xmath84 and for all the possible values of @xmath81 in our model space . in general",
    "one should reach a @xmath85 value for the q - space around 60 for the ground state of the s - shell nuclei and @xmath86 for p - shell nuclei and excited states .",

    ". another interesting feature of the current formulation is that , in contrast to ho effective interaction , the hh effective interaction vanishes at large distances as it should be for a system of non  interacting particles .",
    "in addition we would like to mention that similarly to the ho approach @xcite the present formalism can be extended to incorporate , beyond two  body , also three and more  body effective interactions .",
    "in order to check the proposed formulation of the hyperspherical effective interaction , we apply the described formalism to few ",
    "body nuclei in the mass range @xmath114 .",
    "the following simple nucleon  nucleon interactions are used : malfliet  tjon potentials mtv  @xcite and mt - i / iii  @xcite as well as the minnesota potential mn  @xcite ( see table 1 ) .",
    "of course we are aware that realistic potential models have already been used even for nuclei with @xmath115 @xcite , but the principal aim of the present work is the introduction of the hh effective interaction . to this end",
    "we investigate the rate of convergence of the hh series with the effective interaction for ground state energies , radii , and excitation energies .",
    "in addition we study transitions to continuum states via the method of lorentz integral transform  @xcite .    expanding the effective wave functions into hh basis functions",

    "our results for ground state energies and radii as well as first excitation energies are summarized in table ii . in case that results from other authors",
    "were available they are also given in the table . in general",
    "one observes a very good agreement comparing the results of the various methods . in the following the quality of the convergence for the calculated observables",
    "is discussed in detail .    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the convergence patterns with bare and effective interactions for binding energy and radius of the @xmath116 system with the mn potential .",
    "it is readily seen that the effective interaction improves the convergence drastically . already with",
    "@xmath117 one finds for the energy ( radius ) a deviation of only 0.6 % ( 1.3 % ) from the converged value , while with the bare interaction one needs @xmath118 for a similarly good result . for @xmath119",
    "one obtains sufficiently converged results with the effective interaction , whereas for the bare interaction one has to go up to @xmath120 or higher to reach a similar precision .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the corresponding results for @xmath121he with the mtv potential . in this case",
    "the difference between the convergence of effective and bare interactions is even stronger . for",
    "the effective interaction one obtains almost the correct values for energy and radius with a rather low @xmath55 of 4 .",
    "the convergence with the bare interaction is considerably worse , even with @xmath122 one does not have completely converged results . in fig .",
    "3 we compare our results to those of navratil and barrett with the ho effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "one obtains also for the ho case a very nice convergence , but it depends on the chosen harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath123 . on the other hand",
    "it is evident that the parameter free hh effective interaction leads to a considerable improvement .    in figs .",
    "4 - 6 we give an overview of our results for the bound state properties with the various potential models . for @xmath124",
    "one finds a very good convergence both for binding energy and radius . for the systems with @xmath115 , which approximately can be considered as an @xmath125core plus remaining nucleons at larger distances ,",
    "there is generally a good convergence , but for the case of the radii with the mtv potential .",
    "however , we do not reach the same extremely good precision as for the cases with @xmath126 , since we have to restrict our calculation to a somewhat lower @xmath55 .",
    "this is due to the fact that an increasing number of nucleons leads to a much higher number of hh functions for the same @xmath55 . in general our calculations",
    "are limited to about 400 hh basis functions .",
    "the first excitation energies of the @xmath127 systems are illustrated in fig .",
    "one sees that the convergence patterns are quite similar .",
    "it shows that also non ground state observables can be calculated with sufficient precision with the hh effective interaction",
    ".    one may ask what happens at even higher energies , e.g. in reactions where states in the continuum are involved . in order to address this question we consider as next point transitions from the ground state to continuum states due to an external probe .",
    "such response functions can be calculated with the method of the lorentz integral transform  @xcite . in this formalism , besides the ground state , one needs an additional `` lorentz  state '' @xmath128 , which is localized and which carries all the information about the excitation of the system and of the final state interactions .",
    "the convergence of the lorentz integral transform depends on the convergence on the hyperangular quantum number of the ground state ( @xmath129 ) and that of @xmath128 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "both effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "8 , where we show the lorentz integral transform of the @xmath121he total photoabsorption cross section in the electric dipole approximation with the mt - i / iii potential .",
    "one sees that for a convergent result of the transform a rather low @xmath130 for the hh expansion of @xmath128 is sufficient , while one has to include somewhat higher @xmath129 s in the hh expansion of the ground state .",
    "our result for the lorentz transform is a bit lower than that of ref .",
    "@xcite since there , different from the lorentz state , the ground state was calculated without correlations and was not fully convergent , but the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite remain unchanged .",
    "in this work we have introduced an hyperspherical effective interaction . to this end",
    "we have defined a model space consisting of a complete hyperradial basis and a set of hh functions with generalized angular momentum quantum number @xmath131 .",
    "the effective interaction has been derived from an hyperangular hamiltonian connected with the two  body problem .",
    "the hamiltonian also includes the hyperangular kinetic energy , which is proportional to 1/@xmath132 , where @xmath17 is the collective hyperradial coordinate .",
    "because of this additional @xmath8body piece the @xmath83 residual system can not be considered as a pure spectator .",
    "it leads to an effective interaction depending explicitly on the state of the residual system , similar to the ho multi  valued effective interaction .",
    "we have applied the developed formalism to few ",
    "body systems in the mass range @xmath0 calculating binding / excitation energies , radii and , via the method of the lorentz integral transform , also reactions at energies far in the continuum . for the larger @xmath8 s",
    "these calculations have become feasible due to a powerful algorithm to construct symmetrized basis states . in general",
    "we obtain nicely converging results showing that the hh effective interaction is a very powerful tool .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that the rate of convergence is always very good and does not depend much on the considered observable .",
    "we believe that the inherent confinement of the effective  two  body  hamiltonian is largely responsible for this fact .",
    "eventually we would also like to point out that the present approach has various advantages compared to the harmonic oscillator formalism : ( i ) one does not need to introduce an additional confining potential and contrary to the ho approach one obtains a parameter free effective interaction .",
    "therefore one does not have a problem that is typical for the ho formalism , namely that the convergence of different observables , e.g. binding energies and radii , lead to rather different best choices for such a parameter ; ( ii ) the hh effective interaction is automatically state dependent ; ( iii ) the hh basis functions are much better suited than the ho basis functions to describe the asymptotic part of the wave function . on the other hand",
    "it will require additional effort to elevate the present approach to the same level of sophistication as the ho formalism regarding the use of modern realistic interactions and number of particles .",
    "the authors would like to thank petr navratil for triggering this work by presenting his results at an ect@xmath133 workshop , for stimulating discussions and for providing us with the @xmath121he results for the mtv potential .",
