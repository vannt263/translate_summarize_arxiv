    "next - to - the - leading - order ( nlo ) effects in electroweak interactions play a crucial role in the tests of the standard model and require careful theoretical evaluation . with recent developments in the automatization of the nlo calculations , it is reasonable to consider the possibility that these methods could also be applied to the hadronic electro - weak sector and thus allow for a broader application of the theory .",
    "use of the packages looptools @xcite and form @xcite with extended packages feynarts @xcite and formcalc @xcite created a possibility to perform calculations of parity - violating asymmetries up to nlo level in electron - proton ( e - p ) scattering @xcite and hence provided us with some information on the electro - weak structure of the nucleon . in the work presented here",
    ", we adopt feynarts and formcalc for the nlo symbolic calculations of amplitude or differential cross section in electron - nucleon scattering . using dirac and pauli type couplings with the monopole and dipole form factor approximation",
    ", we construct the computational model enabling feynarts and formcalc to deal with electron - nucleon scattering up to nlo level . in the presented article",
    "we start with a description of the model and then show some results relevant to g0 experiment for the momentum transfers up to @xmath2 .",
    "in addition the prediction for e - p asymmetry for the @xmath0 experiment is given , and analysis of impact of hard - photon - bremsstrahlung ( hpb ) at low momentum transfers is provided .",
    "for the parity violating electron - proton scattering , the interaction between gauge bosons and proton is described in the well known form using dirac and pauli form factors , and then programmed as an extension for the feynarts and formcalc . to accommodate the nucleon structure , we have the couplings preserve their vector and vector - axial structure , but with the charges replaced by the corresponding form factors .",
    "the electromagnetic @xmath3 coupling has two vector components : @xmath4,\\label{e1.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the dirac and pauli form factors , respectively , and @xmath7 is the four - momentum transferred to the nucleon . as for @xmath8 , we have : @xmath9,\\label{e1.6}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as weak dirac , pauli , and axial - vector form factors .",
    "the form factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 are expressed in the following form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is an axial form factor .",
    "our analytical expressions can be simplified considerably if we start with the monopole form factor expressed as @xmath16 the value of the parameter @xmath17 is found from the fit of the electromagnetic form factors by monopole approximation in the low momentum transfer region . in order to produce e - p scattering asymmetries for the dipole form factor , we differentiated the monopole - type asymmetries numerically using the following prescription:*@xmath18 * this way we were able to extend feynarts and formcalc by including dirac and pauli form factors taken in the form of dipole / monopole approximation .",
    "calculations were done in the on - shell renormalization scheme using the feynman gauge.to avoid the infrared divergences , we have treated the final asymmetries with both soft and hard photon bremsstrahlung ( spb + hpb ) contributions . finally , it is important to point out that part of the coupling responsible for the strange content of the proton was excluded from our calculations .",
    "hence , the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results could be explained by the strange content of the proton .",
    "a starting point for our calculations was to produce semi - automatic calculations of asymmetries . over the range of the momentum transfers @xmath19 , it was possible to compare our results to the g0 experiment as well as to the theoretical results of no - vector - strange asymmetry ( @xmath20 ) taken from g0 collaboration @xcite . * * as it can be seen from fig.([fig:1]a ) , our results are very close to the results of g0 , but there is some discrepancy between the theory and experiment , which is most probably due to the strange content of the proton .        at the momentum transfers over the range of @xmath21",
    ", we saw no distinguishable difference between monopole and dipole type of results . to illustrate impact of this difference",
    ", we changed the scale to @xmath22 ( see fig.([fig:1]b ) ) so it is evident that our calculations are independent from the choice of the model for the form factors .",
    "the negligible form factor model dependence can be explained by the relevant contributions coming from the boxes and proton vertex corrections graphs only .    for kinematics relevant to the @xmath0 experiment @xcite , our prediction for the asymmetry was**@xmath23 * * with small uncertainty primarily coming from the different cuts on energy of the emitted hpb photons .",
    "although hpb cuts have big impact on the asymmetry at high momentum transfer , it is quite negligible for the low momentum transfers ( see fig.([fig:2 ] ) ) .        comparing the weak charge of the proton extracted from our asymmetry predictions with upcoming @xmath0 experimental result",
    "may potentially open a window for the new physics .",
    "our plans include development and use of the advanced symbolic computational methods to study various production and decay channels in hadronic physics with the new degree of precision ."
